FT  20 DEC 93 / Fear of redundancy surges
The number of workers who fear they might lose their jobs in the next 12
months rose to more than 50 per cent in December - in spite of last week's
sharp fall in unemployment - the latest MORI/IRS survey for the Financial
Times shows.
It is only the third time since the monthly surveys started last April that
the fear factor has risen over 50 per cent, and the finding suggests that
the Budget last month has had a negative impact on perceptions of job
security.
Fifty-one per cent of the 982 people interviewed said they were very or
fairly concerned about being made redundant.
Part-time women workers are taking most of the jobs being created but this
group has seen the biggest rise in job fears. Anxiety among part-time
workers, who are overwhelmingly women, rose from 35 per cent in November to
49 per cent. Among women in general the figure rose from 43 per cent to 49
per cent.
The anxiety ratio also rose sharply among white-collar and lower managerial
staff, from 44 per cent in November to 52 per cent, possibly reflecting the
likelihood of more public-services job cuts . Anxiety also rose from 35 per
cent to 40 per cent among professional and senior managerial workers. The
age group with the biggest increase was 55-plus, which rose from 32 per cent
to 41 per cent. Anxiety in the Midlands fell slightly but it rose in both
the north of England and the south.
Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment spokesman, said the survey showed
that unemployment figures could fall without bringing any increase in
confidence. He said: 'This survey, like several other indices, seems to be
at odds with what is happening to the official unemployment figures, which
makes one rather suspicious of those figures.'
