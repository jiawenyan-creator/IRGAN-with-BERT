FT  13 JUL 93 / Union pact wins late reprieve for NY Post
THE ailing New York Post newspaper staggered back to life last night when
its unions agreed to large cost concessions demanded by Mr Rupert Murdoch,
who last Friday ended publication of the tabloid and abandoned plans to buy
it.
News Corporation, the media empire headed by Mr Murdoch, said it would
resume publication of the Post today.
The pact appeared to clear away the last big hurdle to Mr Murdoch's purchase
of the paper, although he still faces negotiations in the bankruptcy court
over a purchase price.
News Corporation has been managing the business under a contract with the
court since March 29.
Mr Murdoch walked away from the contract on Friday, complaining that the
group's 11 unions had failed to agreed to Dollars 6.2m (Pounds 4.1m) of cost
concessions which News Corporation said were vital to ensure the paper's
viability in the crowded New York market.
His action threatened the demise of the irreverent 192-year-old tabloid,
America's oldest continuously published newspaper, since no other serious
purchaser appeared in sight.
However, following a weekend of fresh negotiations, which New York governor
Mario Cuomo played a role in initiating, 10 of the Post's 11 unions agreed
to fresh concessions.
The eleventh, the Newspaper Guild, which represents about 290 of the Post's
700 workers, has not accepted a new contract but agreed to return to work
while negotiations continue. It is concerned about job security, while News
Corporation wants the power to make staff redundant.
Mr Murdoch owned the Post until 1988 but was forced to sell it because of US
rules forbidding cross-ownership of both a local television station and a
local newspaper.
However, the Post's dire financial straits encouraged the Federal
Communications Commission, the government body which oversees the media
industry, to give him a permanent waiver from this ruling.
