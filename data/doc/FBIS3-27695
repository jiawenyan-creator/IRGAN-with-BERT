  [Text] Tokyo, February 25 (XINHUA) -- The exchange rate of 
the Chinese renminbi against the U.S. dollar has been stable 
since last July despite the recent unification of China's 
dual-track foreign exchange system, Chinese Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji said here today. 
  Speaking at a press conference at the Japan National Press 
Club in Tokyo, Zhu added: "I hope the renminbi will be stable 
in the future, too." 
  Currently, one dollar is exchanged for about 8.70 yuan on 
the 
Chinese inter-bank foreign exchange market. 
  The new unification and controlled floating exchange-rate 
system, based on market supply and demand, was introduced on 
January 1. 
  Zhu said China unified the system in an effort to pave the 
way for its re-entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT). 
  "So far the reform of foreign exchange rates has been 
successful and China would eventually make the renminbi a hard 
currency that is exchangeable internationally," Zhu added. 
  The vice premier arrived in Japan Wednesday [23 February] 
for 
a nine-day official visit. He is expected to leave for western 
and southwestern Japan Saturday.
