FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: RBS buys private bank for Pounds
10.5m
ROYAL Bank of Scotland is buying Adam &amp; Co, the Edinburgh private bank, a
year after Adam's capital was temporarily wiped out by a Pounds 21m (Dollars
31.5m) loss from unauthorised foreign exchange dealing.
Royal Bank is paying Pounds 10.5m for the private bank which was formed in
1983. Some Pounds 9.5m of that will go to Mrs Francoise Schlumberger Primat,
a French shareholder who rescued Adam &amp; Co last year by injecting Pounds
21m.
Mrs Primat, 75, chose to take the loss rather than wait for her convertible
preference shares to be repaid over 20 years. They had a zero coupon for the
next 10 years and then a 5 per cent annual payment.
Mr James Laurenson, Adam's deputy chairman and managing director who will
become a non-executive director, believed Mrs Primat had 'decided that there
was an inherent loss, and that she should crystallise it now'.
The net asset value of Adam &amp; Co, which has 4,000 private banking clients,
is Pounds 13.5m. Mr Laurenson said it had opted to sell at a discount to
book value because it would be burdened by the repayment of Mrs Primat's
preference shares.
Mr Laurenson said Lazard Brothers, the merchant bank which was retained to
advise on the future of Adam, had recommended the sale as the bank would
otherwise be held back.
