FT  28 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wrong to be called loyalists
Sir, I object to the use of the word loyalists to describe the perpetrators
of killings in Dublin last weekend. These people are not 'loyal' to the
crown, to the UK or to any part of civilised society. They should not be
flattered by the use of that word.
