FT  05 MAR 93 / Observer: No flies on Beijing
Don't try to be a fly on the wall around Beijing's forbidden city this week
 -you're sure to get squashed. Besides red-scarved Young Pioneers on the
prowl with swatters, there are television cameras snooping for any flies
still surviving inspections by top municipal officials.
The purge on flies, together with other blemishes on the face of the city,
is in preparation for tomorrow's arrival of a dozen of the International
Olympic Committee to assess Beijing's bid, in competition with Sydney, to
host the next Olympic Games.
Under banners proclaiming 'A clean and pretty Beijing awaits the year 2000',
the welcoming procedure has been put through no fewer than four practice
runs. And even if the 12 committee members each insist on being chauffeured
around separately during their four-day stay, there will still be two cars
to spare.
But the 14 new Mercedes 280s at their disposal all bear a reminder of what
is expected of them. The number plates read: Beijing 2000.
To enable the party to travel speedily as well as comfortably, local traffic
movements are being curbed. And to improve the city's road-safety image,
bicycling parents have been asked to stop carrying children as passengers.
Even so, reports in the Communist Party's daily paper indicate that 92.6 per
cent of the nation think the costs justified by the potential prize. For
added emphasis, the country's Olympic-affairs chief He Zhenliang has
declared that 1.1bn Chinese are eagerly awaiting the eventual decision.
Presumably he's hoping that if the visitors aren't persuaded in China's
favour by the car number-plates, fear of angering a quarter of the world's
population will do the trick.
