SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
History 



On August 6, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to remove that
portion of Jet Route J171 from Hugo, CO, to Kiowa, CO (58 FR 42038). 

Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Except for editorial changes, this amendment
is the same as that proposed in the notice. Jet routes are published in paragraph 2004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June
17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).
The jet route listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. 



The Rule 



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations revokes a portion of Jet Route J171 from Hugo,
CO, to Kiowa, CO. The Kiowa, CO, VORTAC will be decommissioned after the new Denver International Airport becomes
operational. This accommodates the new Denver International Airport airspace realignment. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore; (1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
