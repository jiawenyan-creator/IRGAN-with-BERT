<DOCTITLE>Granite State Gas Transmission Inc.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>



September 13, 1994.



Take notice that on September 9, 1994, Granite State Gas Transmission, Inc. (Granite State), tendered for filing
as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1 Second Revised Sheet No. 24, containing changes in rates for
effectiveness on September 1, 1994.

According to Granite State, the revised rates on Second Revised Sheet No. 24 are applicable to its Rate Schedule LMS
(Load Management Service) which provides for swings in excess of the daily variance tolerance above or below scheduled
nominations for deliveries to its firm transportation customers under its Rate Schedule FTNN. It is further
stated that Granite State's Rate Schedule LMS service relies on a parallel daily swing service provided by Tennessee
Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) under its Rate Schedule LMSMA. Granite State further states that the rates
for its Rate Schedule LMS service are identical with and track the rates for Tennessee's underlying service.

Granite State also states that Tennessee filed revised tariff sheets in its FERC Gas Tariff, Fifth Revised Volume
No. 1, on July 15, 1994, in compliance with a Stipulation and Agreement approved by the Commission in Docket Nos. RP91203,
et al., which included a revision in its rates for its Rate Schedule LMSMA service, effective September 1, 1993.
Granite State proposes in its filing to track the change in the Tennessee rate effective September 1, 1994, rather
than retroactively.

According to Granite State, copies of its filing were served on its Rate Schedule LMS customers, Bay State Gas Company
and Northern Utilities, Inc., and the regulatory commissions of the states of Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said filing should file a motion to intervene
or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, D.C. 20426 in
accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214).
All such motions or protests should be filed on or before September 20, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to the proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a
motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission
and are available for public inspection.
