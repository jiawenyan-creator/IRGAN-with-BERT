FT  24 DEC 92 / Strong franc hits French exports
FRANCE'S trade surplus fell sharply last month as the strength of the franc
since the September currency crisis led to a squeeze on exports.
The preliminary November trade figures published yesterday indicated a
surplus of FFr389m (Pounds 47m), far below October's FFr789m.
Exports slipped from FFr100.5bn in October to FFr100.2bn last month, while
imports rose slightly, despite the depressed state of consumer demand, from
FFr99.7bn to FFr99.8bn.
The November figures took the trading surplus for the first 11 months of
1992 to FFr23.9bn, against a deficit of FFr27.4bn in the same period last
year.
