DODGERS' LOSS ENDS ROAD TRIP 
Dave Magadan broke a 4-for-23 slump with two run-scoring hits, and Howard 
Johnson homered, leading the New York Mets over the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-1 
today. 
The Mets finished their home stand 5-5 and now head to the West Coast for 10 
games. Los Angeles concluded its 15-game road trip 8-7. 
Winner Ron Darling (5-7) pitched in and out of trouble, giving up one run and 
eight hits in six innings. The Dodgers left six runners on base in Darling's 
last three innings. 
Bob Ojeda, whom Darling replaced in the starting rotation, worked 2 1-3 
scoreless innings in relief, and John Franco earned his 27th save in 30 chances 
by getting the final two outs.
