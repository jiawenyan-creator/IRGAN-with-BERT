LIZ SMITH: 'JUSTIFY MY LOVE' VIDEO FEATURES MADONNA'S NEW GUY 
MADONNA IS in Paris getting ready to begin making the video of her new single, 
"Justify My Love." This is one of two fresh songs on her greatest-hits 
compilation titled "Immaculate Collection." 
The star co-wrote this song with Lenny Kravitz, a guy who knows a lot about 
controversial women. (He is wed to "Cosby" kid Lisa Bonet.) Madonna's husky 
rendition of the song isn't something one would get up and dance to -- recline 
to, maybe. "Justify My Love" is to be directed by Jean Baptiste Mondino, who 
put the blond one through her paces for the "Open Your Heart" video in which 
she played a peep-show dancer. 
The singer's new steady guy, Tony Ward, will have a prominent role in the 
video. He could be the reason Madonna's faction is saying that "Justify My 
Love" will be Madonna's "sexiest and most romantic video ever." But don't 
"they" always say something like that? All I know about Tony Ward is that he is 
like a taller, darker, sexier version of Sean Penn and said to be a very sweet 
person. 
SO, WHY, with all this plush hype, didn't Madonna show up at Glamour magazine's 
big "Ten Women of the Year" awards for 1990, or send a representative? Insiders 
claim it was because Glamour's art department retouched Madonna's teeth, 
filling in the gaps in their cover photo. And SHE didn't like that one bit. 
Glamour described the star as "personifying women's power of 
self-determination." You got that right. 
ANJELICA HUSTON is startlingly blond in her new movie, "The Grifters," and the 
dark beauty says she enjoys the change. She explains: "Wearing the blond wig 
immediately made me feel different. . . . As a blonde I got a kind of 'halo' 
effect. But I was a serious, no-nonsense blonde. Sometime though, I'd like to 
be one of those real fun blondes." 
"The Grifters" has some good word-of-mouth and opens for one week in December 
to make it eligible for the Academy Awards.
