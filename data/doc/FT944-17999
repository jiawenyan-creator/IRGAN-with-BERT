FT  05 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei lower on new
issue worries
Increasing worries over the fall in Japan Telecom and pessimism over the
subscription for Japan Tobacco shares took the Nikkei 225 average into a
moderate loss on small-lot selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index finished 81.42 off at 19,568.61 after trading within a narrow
range between 19,651.83 and 19,525.71. Volume totalled 161m shares, against
Monday's 158m. Most investors were inactive, including corp-orate investors
and public funds.
The Topix index of all first section stocks relinquished 6.21 at 1,572.79
and the Nikkei 300 shed 1.45 to 287.50. Declines outnumbered rises by 526 to
388, with 223 issues unchanged, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
softened 0.14 to 1,288.09.
The Finance Ministry announced the winners of the lottery for the 436,666
Japan Tobacco shares on public offer. Investors that won have until next
Tuesday to purchase the shares, but most market participants expect a
shortage of subscribers due to current market conditions and recent weakness
of Japan Telecom.
The latter, listed on the second section and a recent benchmark for market
sentiment, lost Y70,000 at Y3.8m after sinking to a new intra-market low of
Y3.78m. DDI, another second section telecom company, dipped Y2,000 to
Y864,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y9,000 to Y862,000.
Brokerage shares were weak on the low trading volume. Nomura Securities
receded Y50 to Y1,980 and Nikko Securities Y20 to Y1,090.
Nippon Shinpan, a consumer credit company, dropped Y55 to Y758 on rumours of
financial problems at its financial affiliates, due to mounting bad loans.
Steels were actively traded. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day,
slipped Y4 to Y384 and Kawasaki Steel declined Y6 to Y439.
High-priced stocks were sold, with Nintendo, the video game maker, Y310
lower at Y5,460. The company announced that its first-half pre-tax profits
fell 16 per cent, down from its initial forecast due to the higher yen and
sluggish domestic sales.
Nintendo's weakness dragged down Sega Enterprises, another video equipment
maker, which retreated Y430 to Y5,650 on earnings worries.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 33.30 to 21,962.98 in volume of 8.3m
shares.
Roundup
A mixture of influences drove the Pacific Rim markets.
SYDNEY ended below key support at a 2 1/2 -month low amid mounting concern
over rising local interest rates, but overall volumes were thin. The All
Ordinaries index closed 32.9 or 1.6 per cent down at 1,998.0.
News Corp fell 41 cents or 4.8 per cent to a 14-month low of ADollars 8.06
as investors took a scathing view of the group's preference share issue
aimed at financing acquisitions without diluting Mr Rupert Murdoch's
control.
WELLINGTON declined almost 1 per cent as an already weak market was
unsettled further when Mr Don Brash, the Reserve Bank governor, told a
parliamentary select committee that inflationary pressures were greater than
forecast just a month ago.
He said that he was comfortable with the sharp rise in interest rates in the
interim and did not see any need for further tightening.
The NZSE-40 capital index ended 19.73 down at 2,057.50. Telecom and Fletcher
Challenge, the two stocks which had shown greatest strength recently, led
the falls, each losing 6 cents at NZDollars 5.29 and NZDollars 4.24
respectively.
SEOUL pressed ahead to a new closing high, the composite index rising 10.41
to 1,064.64, with the announcement of a partial cabinet reshuffle involving
the country's top economic ministers helping to boost sentiment.
A 1.8 per cent fall in the banking sub-index contrasted with the day's
gains. The newly listed Citizens National Bank went the day's limit up of
Won800 to Won17,400 but other banking issues were lacklustre.
TAIPEI edged back as profits were taken in financial stocks after their
recent strong run. The weighted index was finally 3.83 off at 7,179.92 after

Among losing financials, ICBC shed 50 cents to TDollars 104.5. Closed-end
funds, however, rose on newspaper reports that some would pay good dividends
by the year-end. Kwang Hua Fortune Fund put on 5 cents at TDollars 13.25 and

MANILA saw a broad-based advance which lifted the composite index 32.27 to
2,953.61.

some speculative interest in second line issues. The Hang Seng index was up
11.63 at 9,504.12, off a high of 9,547.78.
BOMBAY was firmer, led by polyester fibre and yarn makers, which announced
that they were raising prices of their products. The BSE 30-share index
gained 26.68 at 4,366.14.
SINGAPORE was led ahead by firm foreign demand for banks, properties and
other blue chips, but Malaysian shares traded over the counter faced selling
pressure.
The Straits Times Industrial index moved up 22.04 to 2,370.56. Malaysia's
Yeo Hiap Seng climbed 85 cents to SDollars 8.85 on persistent rumours that a
takeover was in the making.
KARACHI jumped the 2,300-point barrier for the first time since August 11 in
brisk trading, boosted by overseas interest in cement and polyester stocks
ahead of year-end results. The KSE 100-share index rose 16.07 to 2,310.54.
COLOMBO was lower for a fifth straight day on reduced foreign support, the
all-share index dipping 10.90 to 1,124.68.
