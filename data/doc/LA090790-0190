TALKS TO BRING 'MISS SAIGON' TO N.Y. 'CORDIAL' 
Talks between British producer Cameron Mackintosh and officials of Actors 
Equity union over the casting of the Broadway production of "Miss Saigon" have 
been "cordial and constructive," it was reported today. 
Mackintosh met Thursday with Alan Eisenberg, executive secretary of Equity, and 
scheduled another meeting Monday. 
He arrived earlier this week from London at the invitation of Eisenberg to 
clear the way for the opening of the $10-million hit musical at the Broadway 
Theater next April. 
Mackintosh canceled the opening in a dispute with the union over casting 
British actor Jonathan Pryce in the Eurasian starring role that Pryce 
originated in London. 
Early last month, Equity barred Pryce from playing on Broadway as the result of 
pressure from members of Asian background who oppose trans-racial casting 
because it takes roles away from Asians. 
Mackintosh said he could not allow abridgement of his artistic freedom to cast 
as he pleases. 
Equity's governing council reversed its decision on Pryce on Aug. 23 and asked 
Mackintosh to come to New York to discuss reinstatement of "Miss Saigon," which 
already had broken the Broadway record for advance ticket sales by taking in 
$25 million at the box office.
