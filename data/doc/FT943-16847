FT  02 JUL 94 / US agrees to sign Law of Sea treaty
The US is to sign the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea at the end of this
month, after more than a decade of opposition.
The treaty, which sets rules on sea-bed mining and oil exploration, fishing
rights and scientific research, has already been ratified by 61 countries
and is due to take effect in November.
Successive US administrations have blocked ratification of the treaty on the
grounds that it restrained private enterprise in sea-bed mining. However, Mr
Warren Christopher, secretary of state, told the Senate foreign relations
committee on Thursday that the US had successfully negotiated changes to
make the treaty more business-friendly.
The treaty also guarantees rights of passage through straits and gives
countries full sovereignty within 12 miles of their coasts and control of
fishing and mining rights within a 200-mile zone.
US adherence to the treaty must be approved by the Senate, and some
Republicans are expected to maintain their objections.
The treaty's coming into force is unlikely to lead to a boom in sea-bed
mining. Shortages of key minerals that were predicted when treaty
negotiations began in the early 1970s have not come about and mining in deep
waters remains costly.
