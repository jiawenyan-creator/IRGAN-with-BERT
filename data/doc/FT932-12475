FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: Travis Perkins falls 21% after lower
property sales
TRAVIS PERKINS, the timber and building materials merchant, yesterday
reported higher 1992 trading profits and said sales and profits were ahead
in the first quarter of this year.
However, reduced profits of Pounds 1.64m (Pounds 5.84m) on the sale of
surplus property, meant that pre-tax profits dropped 21 per cent, from
Pounds 14m to Pounds 11m, and earnings per share fell 29 per cent to 7.7p
(10.8p).
Despite this, the final dividend is again 5.5p, maintaining the total, which
is not fully covered, at 8p.
Trading profits at the group, which operates 165 building materials depots
and 11 garden centres, increased 6 per cent to Pounds 9.63m despite a 2 per
cent decline in turnover to Pounds 303.4m.
The average number of employees in the group was reduced by 12.6 per cent to
3,219 with output per employee improving by 11.9 per cent.
The bad debt charge improved slightly to 1.2 per cent of credit sales from
1.4 per cent the previous year - the first improvement for four years.
Net interest payments declined to Pounds 242,000 (Pounds 357,000) mainly
reflecting reduced borrowings which fell to Pounds 1m (Pounds 7.8m) at the
end of December, but the pre-tax profit figure was overshadowed by the
year-on-year drop in proceeds from property sales.
Mr Tony Travis, chairman, said the current year had started 'with more
promise' and sales were up about 2 per cent in volume terms and about 4 per
cent in value.
COMMENT
Travis' chairman acknowledges that the time taken integrating Travis Arnold
and Sandell Perkins following their merger in 1988 probably means it has
been 'missing the boat' in terms of other acquisitions which might have
provided it with a short cut to becoming a truly national builders
merchants' group. Nevertheless, the group, which has about 4 per cent of the
domestic market, is still looking for smaller deals. Even without
substantialy higher profits on property disposals, the group should benefit
from the economic upturn. Some 70 per cent of its sales relate to the
replacement, repair and improvement market and with business prospects
improving there should be be no more redundancy costs. Pre-tax profits of
Pounds 14m look possible this year producing earnings of 9.5p. The stock -
which gained 13p yesterday to 218p producing a prospective p/e of 23 - could
still go higher.
