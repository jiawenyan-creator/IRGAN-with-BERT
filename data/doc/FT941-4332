FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Go-Ahead sets out on the road to market
with Pounds 40m valuation
The Go-Ahead Group, a bus service operator based in Gateshead, will be
floated by the summer with a market capitalisation of more than Pounds 40m.
Like buses everywhere, it comes hard on the heels of two other operators -
Stagecoach, the Perth-based group which came to the market last April, and
Badgerline, the Avon-based operator which was floated in November.
Go-Ahead plans to focus on urban transport and has recently acquired the
Brighton &amp; Hove Bus and Coach Company and the Oxford Bus Company. The group
operates more than 1,000 buses, with an annualised turnover of more than
Pounds 75m. The proceeds of the placing will be used to repay Pounds 12m of
debt.
Mr Martin Ballinger, managing director, said: 'We aim to continue our
expansion as a leading provider of urban transport throughout the UK.'
Go-Ahead was formed in 1987 by a management buy-out of Northern General
Transport Company from the National Bus Company. The flotation is being
sponsored by Hill Samuel, with Panmure Gordon as broker to the issue.
Badgerline has been informed by the Office of Fair Trading that its Pounds
23m purchase last month of PMT Group did not appear to qualify for
investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
