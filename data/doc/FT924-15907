FT  01 OCT 92 / Letter: Industrial logic sole reason for unions' merger
Sir, Your report ('TGWU confirms merger plan', September 26) on my union's
new relationship with Britain's other general union, the GMB, is misleading
in its implication that our financial situation has played a part in our
desire to develop a partnership, possibly leading to a merger.
First, I wish to make it clear that industrial logic, and only industrial
logic, shapes the T&amp;G's merger strategy. It is that logic, which serves the
interests of our members at the workplace, which has led me top seek to
forge closer links with the GMB. We organise in the same industries and face
similar problems and opportunities. The same logic will apply in the T&amp;G's
developing relationships with other trade unions.
Second, your report does not fairly represent the T&amp;G's financial position.
More than half of our deficit last year was caused by one-off payments
relating to an early retirement scheme for officers and staff. That is one
of the measures we have taken to put ourselves on a firm footing for the
future. Our budgeted target was to break-even at the end of the year. Not
only are we on course to meet this, but all our projections indicate that we
shall substantially exceed the break-even point.
That is despite continuing membership losses caused by the crisis in the
manufacturing industries.
Our strong asset base, one of the largest in the British trade union
movement, ensures that we can look to alliances based on industrial logic
and for no other reason.
