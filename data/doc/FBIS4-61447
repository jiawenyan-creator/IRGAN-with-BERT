  [Text] Kiev, 5 May (ITAR-TASS) -- "Relations between 
Ukraine and Crimea should be built on the basis of equality and 
mutual benefit. And this will be the main topic of my meeting 
with President Yuriy Meshkov in Simferopol 7 May," Ukraine's 
Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskyy told an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent today. 
  Yesterday's conversation behind closed doors with Crimea's 
Vice President Yevgeniy Saburov served as a kind of "impetus" 
for the trip. Yefim Zvyagilskyy was satisfied with its outcome. 
He was heartened by the fact that in response to the question: 
"Where do Crimea's loyalties lie?" Yevgeniy Saburov said 
unequivocally: "With Ukraine." "It was only after this that I 
decided to meet the president of Crimea," Yefim Zvyagilskyy 
stressed.
