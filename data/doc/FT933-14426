FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: US foods group expects better
second half
CPC International, the US foods group, expects earnings to improve in the
second half and to outpace the Dollars 1.34 per share earned in the first
six months of 1993, Reuter reports from New York.
Mr Fred Meendsen, CPC vice-president, declined after a meeting with analysts
to make a specific forecast on full-year earnings. He added, however, that
the company was 'not significantly uncomfortable' with Wall Street estimates
of earnings between Dollars 2.95 and Dollars 3 for all of 1993.
CPC posted second quarter net income of Dollars 116.9m, or 76 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 111.3m, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier.
