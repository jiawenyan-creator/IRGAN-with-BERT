FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Fox, ABC consider Mexican TV
stakes
THE FOX television broad-casting subsidiary of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation is one of two US media groups that have held exploratory talks
about participating in the privatisation of Mexican state television.
Capital Cities/ABC, the media group that owns ABC Television, is the other
US company understood to be interested in taking an equity stake in a
privatised Mexican television network.
Industry sources say Mr Murdoch visited Mexico City a few months ago to
examine the possibility of becoming involved in the planned privatisation of
two state-owned Mexican networks.
Although Fox declined to comment yesterday, company executives are believed
to have held preliminary talks with private-sector Mexican media companies,
including a consortium led by Multivision, a Mexican cable television
company.
However, a decision by Fox is not imminent, according to executives familiar
with the talks.
Capital Cities/ABC also declined to comment yesterday. However, it is
understood the company has also held exploratory talks in Mexico City,
having sent one of its top executives recently to discuss a possible joint
venture with a private investment group being formed to participate in the
privatisation bidding.
Industry sources say Mexican television would offer a series of natural
tie-ins for US broadcasters.
