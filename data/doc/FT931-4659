FT  10 MAR 93 / Letter: London in urgent need of transport investment
Sir, Your leader, 'Rail in London' (March 9), is right to highlight the
serious flaws in the logic upon which the rumoured postponement of Crossrail
is based. It should be borne in mind that the same manipulators of
statistics influenced the capacity of the M25 - a brilliant exercise in
forethought, analysis and planning for growth. In this case, they appear to
have overlooked the Paddington-to-Heathrow link, among other things.
There is little doubt that the transport infrastructure in and around London
is at crisis point and, political dogma apart, is in urgent need of
significant investment. If London is to retain its position in the premier
league of international financial centres that investment must be committed
now - and not just on rail projects.
Those responsible for traffic planning in the metropolis seem obsessed by
their need to manipulate congestion instead of adopting a longer-term policy
of providing diversity. There is no value in diverting the congested Al3
traffic on to the new Docklands highway if, as is likely, the result is
gridlock at Tower Hill. Similarly, there is no point in providing the
Channel tunnel termini at Stratford and Waterloo if the Jubilee Line is not
extended.
Your editorial is wrong, however, to compare Crossrail with the Jubilee
Line. Twenty-five per cent of the cost of the Jubilee Line extension will be
borne by the private sector, just as the Pounds 3.25bn public investment in
infrastructure has been matched by Pounds 12.5bn of private investment in
the area. Docklands is far from being a 'withered extremity'. It is alive,
confident in attitude and poised to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
Now all we need to do is apply the same formula to the rest of London.
