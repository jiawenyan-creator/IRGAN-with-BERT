Ethiopia's Parliament unanimously endorsed the idea of unconditional peace 
talks with rebels in Eritrea aimed at ending the 28-year-old civil war in 
northeastern Africa. The government's six-point peace plan was approved by all 
750 deputies present at a special session of the 835-member body convened to 
discuss the war in Eritrea. Diplomats said it was the first time President 
Mengistu Haile Mariam had set no conditions for negotiating with the rebels in 
the north. Under the plan, the talks would be attended by international 
observers.
