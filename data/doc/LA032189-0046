THE WORLD; 
SOVIET MISSILE-BASE SWITCH 
The Soviet Union said that some of its medium-range nuclear missile bases will 
be converted to intercontinental missile bases. The conversion is allowed under 
the terms of the U.S.-Soviet Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, and Moscow has 
informed the United States of its plans, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim 
Perfilyev told a Moscow news conference. He said SS-20 medium-range missiles 
deployed at the bases are being scrapped in accordance with the INF treaty and 
that the bases will be re-equipped to hold SS-25 intercontinental ballistic 
missiles. Perfilyev did not say how many bases are being converted or disclose 
their location.
