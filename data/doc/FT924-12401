FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Suez down 72% in property slump
SUEZ, the big French financial holding group, announced yesterday that the
country's property slump had caused its profits to plunge by 72 per cent in
the first half of this year to FFr500m (Dollars 104.6m), compared with
FFr1.8bn in the same period of 1991.
Mr Gerard Worms, the group's president, said he saw no prospect of rapid
improvement in the property market this year or next. The group raised its
property provisions from FFr100m in the first half of last year to FFr1.9bn
in the first six months of this year.
Suez also announced restructuring plans involving a bid for the rest of the
capital of Compagnie Fonciere International (CFI), in which Suez holds 54
per cent, and the sale of its FFr40m majority stakes in two investment
companies, Parthena and Astorg. CFI, a property investing and managing
company, showed net profits of FFr194m last year.
Mr Worms claimed his group was facing up 'more openly and more rapidly' to
problems posed by the property slump - a result of persistent high real
interest rates in the French economy - than other financial groups. By
mid-1992, it had set aside adequate provisions to cover 10 per cent of its
exposure in office property.
Before making these provisions, the group's results showed a 60 per cent
rise in operating profit to FFr 3.2bn compared with a year ago.
Suez has had a poor return for several years on its majority stake in
Societe Generale de Belgique. But the Belgian conglomerate gave its French
owners a 47 per cent increase in profit in the first half of this year,
compared to the same period last year.
Suez's poor performance was expected from results already in from its
subsidiary, Banque Indosuez, which Mr Worms said was plagued with property
problems, and from Groupe Victoire, the insurance company in which Suez has
a 52 per cent stake.
