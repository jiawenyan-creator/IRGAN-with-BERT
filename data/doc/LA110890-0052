BURGLARS TAKE JEWELRY VALUED AT $225,000 
Burglars broke into a Valencia jewelry store early Wednesday and stole more 
than 2,000 rings, necklaces and bracelets valued at $225,000, authorities said. 
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies, summoned by a silent alarm at Addie's 
Gold and Jewelry at 24311 Magic Mountain Parkway, found the plate glass front 
door smashed about 12:05 a.m., Lt. Don Rodriguez said. 
Rodriguez said three glass display cases were broken and emptied of more than 
2,000 pieces. Deputies arrived within minutes of the alarm but found no 
burglars. Shop owner Gary Popejoy said much of the jewelry had arrived recently 
and had not yet been put in a safe. The stolen jewelry was intended for the 
store's Christmas inventory. Popejoy said he closed his shop Wednesday for 
repairs but planned to reopen today.
