FT  19 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Chicago exchanges seek more
futures exemptions
THE COMMODITY Futures Trading Commission, the primary regulator of the US
futures industry, is asking for public comment on applications from the
Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to be exempted
from many of the agency's rules.
The 60-day comment period could set the stage for a significant change in
the agency's way of treating institutional transactions on organised
exchanges.
The CFTC, using new powers granted under its 1992 reauthorisation, exempted
off-exchange swap, hybrid, and energy contracts from its jurisdiction
earlier this year with relatively little public debate. Those exemptions
were for transactions not previously regulated by the CFTC.
The CBoT and CME argue that similar exemptions are due for their
institutionally-traded contracts.
The CME has specifically asked for regulatory relief for its new 'rolling
spot' currency products, which are aimed at interbank foreign exchange
traders.
The CFTC, noting that such exemptions would be a fundamental departure from
exchange regulation of the last 70 years, has made it clear it wants broad
public input before making a decision.
Mr Albrecht, acting CFTC chairman, said the CFTC's decision would depend 'in
large measure on what happens during the comment period'.
The agency is not in a strong position for landmark decision-making.
Mr Albrecht steps down from the Commission on Friday, leaving three seats
vacant on the five-member board.
Commissioners are nominated by the White House, and President Bill Clinton
has not yet named any choices for the CFTC.
