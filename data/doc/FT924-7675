FT  14 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Taxing policy
MY WIFE and I recently surrendered a single premium policy held in our joint
names. The difference between the premium and the surrender value is several
thousand pounds. Will my wife's half affect her over-65 age allowance?
Without her half of the profits her income does not exceed her personal
allowance limit for the age allowance. Therefore, although she would not be
liable to pay tax on her half of the profit directly, would she indirectly
have to pay tax on whatever position exceeds the age allowance limit?
Yes: the whole of your wife's share of the chargeable gain is taken into
account in calculating her age-allowance clawback, so there may be an
effective 12 1/2 per cent tax charge.
You will be eligible for top-slicing relief in calculating any 15 per cent
higher rate liability, but there is no top-slicing for age allowance
clawback.
If you provided the funds to pay the premium, it may be that section
547(1)(a) or section 674A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988
requires the whole of the chargeable gain to be treated as your own income.
