FT  03 FEB 94 / Euro Disney pushed further into the red by falling sales
Euro Disney, the stricken leisure group, yesterday revealed a further slide
into the red with a net first-quarter loss of FFr553m (Pounds 62m) against a
FFr423m deficit in the same period last year.
The loss for the three months to December 31 was announced as Euro Disney's
60 creditor banks were starting a special meeting in Paris to plan their
tactics for negotiating the group's emergency financial restructuring.
At the meeting the banks discussed a preliminary report on Euro Disney's
financial position compiled by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy group.
KPMG had been unable to complete its full report in time for the meeting,
claiming that Walt Disney, the US group that owns 49 per cent of Euro
Disney, had refused to release sufficient information. The banks plan to
meet again when the full report is available. It is scheduled for completion
in two weeks' time.
The banks have been asked to give a mandate to a steering committee, led by
Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez, to start the negotiations.
The steering committee is expected to press Walt Disney to extend the
deadline for negotiations from the original date of March 31 because of the
delay in completing the KPMG report.
Walt Disney has already tabled proposals to halve Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn
net debt through a rights issue and debt-for-equity swap. The banks are keen
to ensure that it plays a larger part in the restructuring, notably by
reducing its entitlement to royalties from Euro Disney.
Euro Disney said that it had maintained operating profits in the first
quarter but suffered a 12 per cent fall in sales to FFr828m from FFr944m.
The group has been offering discounted entrance to the EuroDisneyland theme
park and cutting some hotel rates in an attempt to boost attendance during
the slack winter season.
