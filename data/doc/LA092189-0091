DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PRIVATE TALKS TO LOOK AT POPULATION CHANGES 
The challenges arising from Glendale's changing population will be examined by 
business, education and political leaders in a seven-week series of private 
talks beginning this week. 
The forum, titled "Understanding Glendale for the Future," will open with an 
invitation-only session from 8 to 11 a.m. Saturday in the City Council Chamber, 
613 E. Broadway. Occidental College President John B. Slaughter will give the 
keynote address. 
Participants will then meet on five successive Wednesday evenings in private 
homes to discuss such issues as crime, traffic, transportation, housing, 
education and cultural diversity. 
The forum is sponsored by the city of Glendale, Glendale Community College and 
Glendale Partners, a group of Glendale business owners and chief executive 
officers. 
"Ideally, this process will result in a better understanding of each other's 
cultures and an appreciation not only of our differences but also of all the 
things we have in common," said Martha Thayer, chairman of the education/ethnic 
mix committee of Glendale Partners, which organized the forum. 
A closing session will be held Nov. 2.
