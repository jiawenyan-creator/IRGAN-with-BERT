FIESTA BOWL DEFEATS ROSE BOWL IN TV RATINGS RACE, 17.0 TO 10.8 
NBC's telecast of the Fiesta Bowl football game between national champion Notre 
Dame and West Virginia on Jan. 2 drew a 17.0 national rating, the highest of 
any bowl game this year, the network said. 
Playing opposite the Fiesta Bowl, ABC's Rose Bowl had a 10.8 rating, lowest in 
the television history of the game, NBC said. 
The rating means an average of 17% of all U.S. TV households were tuned into 
the Fiesta Bowl, or about 15.4 million households. 
"The Fiesta Bowl, of course, was for the national championship, and it was the 
highest-rated of the year, facing what traditionally is the highest-rated bowl 
game," NBC research specialist Gray Seamans said. "And we beat it handily -- by 
57%." 
CBS' Cotton Bowl, in which UCLA defeated Arkansas, drew a 9.8 rating, lowest in 
its history, and the Hall of Fame Bowl on NBC had an 8.1. The Citrus Bowl, on 
ABC, had a 7.2 rating. 
National ratings were announced earlier for NBC's Orange Bowl, 12.8, and ABC's 
Sugar Bowl, 8.1, which were shown against one another in prime time. 
Seamans said the highest-rated bowl game ever was the Orange Bowl's national 
championship showdown 2 years ago, which had a 25.1 rating.
