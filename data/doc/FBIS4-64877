  [Text] Brussels, May 9 (AFP) -- Nearly two million people 
are facing famine in Rwanda and Burundi and humanitarian workers 
are struggling to feed refugees, the Catholic aid organisation 
Caritas International said here Monday [9 May]. 
  Caritas spokesman Jean-Paul Evrard said the two Central 
African nations faced starvation on a scale exceeding the 
famines in Somalia and Ethiopia in recent years. 
  "We have the money to buy food, but there is virtually 
nothing to buy (in Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi)," he told a 
press conference. 
  Evrard added that prices of haricot beans, a staple food of 
the two countries, had been driven up to exorbitant levels. 
  The United Nations has estimated that 200,000 people have 
been killed in the civil war which broke out in Rwanda about 
April 8 and is still raging. Evrard described the plight of 
refugees as "horrifying." 
  At the St Andre refugee camp at Kabgayi, 8,000 people were 
packed into a few hundred square metres so tightly that it was 
impossible to extract the body of someone who died there one 
night recently, the aid worker said. 
  Caritas officials added that militia of the dominant Hutu 
tribe in Rwanda were waging a terror campaign against the 
minority Tutsis, destroying villages and slaying their 
inhabitants. 
  "We have often been told that villagers were forced to kill 
their neighbours in order to avoid being massacred themselves," 
one official reported.
