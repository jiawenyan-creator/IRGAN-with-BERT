FT  23 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Civil Service union to urge rejection
of 8% pay offer
MEMBERS of Britain's second-largest Civil Service union will be advised by
their leaders to reject the government's 8 per cent pay offer.
The executive of the NUCPS union also left open the possibility of a ballot
on industrial action if members accepted their rejection recommendation and
the government continued to refuse arbitration.
In contrast, the leadership of the CPSA, tbe largest Civil Service union,
decided to recommend their members to accept a separate 8 per cent offer.
The leaderships of both unions believe the 8 per cent offers break the
spirit of long-term pay agreements which allow a form of comparability with
the private sector.
Under the agreements, offers fall within the middle range of comparable
private-sector settlements in the previous year.
This year the range was 8 per cent to 10 per cent, with a median of 9 per
cent.
Although the offers are 8 per cent the majority of both unions' members will
receive less - 7.6 per cent in the case of CPSA and 7.8 per cent in NUCPS.
The balance is made up of high awards of up to 11 per cent for lower-paid
civil servants.
The Treasury has refused the two unions' request for arbitration.
Ms Marion Chambers, CPSA president, said her union executive felt the
alternative to recommending acceptance was industrial action and there was
no mood for this among members.
Some members of the NUCPS executive believe their members will also be
reluctant to take action.
