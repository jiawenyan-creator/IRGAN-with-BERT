FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: BHF-Bank climbs 14%
BHF-BANK said yesterday group operating profits rose by 'a good 14 per cent'
in the first nine months of the year to DM229m (Dollars 135.5m). As is usual
for German banks, the increase is calculated with reference to
three-quarters of last year's profits.
Partial operating profits, which excludes profits from own account trading,
for the Frankfurt-based merchant bank rose by 29 per cent while the group's
total assets increased 17 per cent to DM55bn. The bank attributed this to
relatively strong asset expansion in subsidiaries operating in low-risk
sectors. Group personnel and materials costs rose by only 7 per cent.
BHF gave no further details of the profits increase. However it is likely
the results have benefited from healthy trading gains in the buoyant German
equity and bund markets. In the first six months of the current year,
operating profits rose 23 per cent to DM148m after setting aside DM67m
against bad and doubtful loans.
