FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bank Slaski soars in first day's
trading
Shares in Bank Slaski soared on the first day of trading in the group to
6.7m zlotys (Dollars 310), compared with the issue price of 500,000 zlotys
when 30 per cent of the Polish bank's equity was sold to the public last
November.
Earlier this month ING, the Dutch bank, purchased a 25.9 per cent stake in
Bank Slaski at the offer price, which represented a Dollars 57.1m
investment. The bank promised to hold the shares for three years.
The closing price left bankers and small investors surprised. 'I simply
don't know where the money is coming from,' a financier commented.
There are now 23 stocks traded on the Warsaw Stock Exchange with a combined
capitalisation of 149,183.5bn zlotys. Bank Slaski's debut came as the
exchange index climbed to another record, up 6.1 per cent to 16,808.6, with
turnover at 2,925bn zlotys.
Mr Stefan Kawalec, the deputy finance minister who is responsible for
Poland's bank privatisation programme, noted, however, that yesterday's
Slaski turnover accounted for a mere 0.35 per cent of the bank's equity. He
said the results of the Slaski sale would be examined very carefully when
choosing a strategy for the sale of the Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo
Handlowy, which he hopes to complete by the middle of this year.
Yesterday's share price gives Bank Slaski, which reported a 1,865bn zloty
net profit for last year, a price earnings ratio of 33.5, compared with an
average of 32.8 for the other three banks quoted on the exchange.
Morgan Grenfell has opened an office in Warsaw. The UK-based merchant bank
is advising the Polish government on the sale of the tobacco industry and
acted for AT&amp;T when it bought the Telfa telecommunications plant recently.
Morgan Grenfell's move to Warsaw follows Schroder and Samuel Montagu, which
both have local subsidiaries.
