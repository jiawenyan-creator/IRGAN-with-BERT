FT  31 JAN 92 / Rank falls 19.7% to Pounds 250.5m pre-tax
SHARPLY higher interest costs combined with the recession to push full-year
pre-tax profits down 19.7 per cent to Pounds 250.5m at the Rank
Organisation, the leisure group whose interests include casinos, bingo, the
Hard Rock cafes and Butlin's holiday camps.
Sir Patrick Meany, chairman, said: 'I wouldn't wish to pretend that our
results are anything but disappointing to us.'
Rank's shares rose 45p yesterday to close at 640p as the group confounded
market rumours that it was going to cut its dividend and announce a rights
issue. The final dividend of 20.75p brings the total payment for the year to
an unchanged 31p.
Turnover was Pounds 2.1bn, compared with Pounds 1.3bn in 1990. Last year's
figure, however, includes the contribution from Mecca, which Rank bought in
August 1990. On a comparable basis, 1990 turnover would have been just over
Pounds 2bn. Trading profit was Pounds 186.6m, compared with an actual Pounds
145.1m in the previous year or Pounds 192.7m if the figure is adjusted as if
Mecca had been in the group throughout 1990. Earnings per share fell from
70.1p in 1990 to 38.4p last year.
Profits rose to Pounds 59.4m, against Pounds 34.2m or an adjusted Pounds
52.6m, in the recreation business. Profits also rose to Pounds 23.6m -
against Pounds 5.1m actual, or Pounds 22.2m adjusted - in leisure.
The drop in trading profit came primarily in the film and television
businesses which fell to Pounds 21.9m from Pounds 36.7m actual and adjusted.
Profits from Rank's interest in Rank Xerox, the photocopying company were
Pounds 158.7m, compared with Pounds 167.2m in 1990.
Interest costs rose to Pounds 93m from Pounds 16.2m, due to high borrowing
rates and the assumption of Mecca's debts.
Investors in the Hard Rock Cafe have filed suit in Los Angeles against Rank
for allegedly trying to coerce them into selling their interests in the
restaurant company below the market price. They are seeking damages of more
than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 555.5m).
A. Kershaw and Sons, Rank's separately quoted subsidiary which owns about 10
per cent of the group's 49 per cent share of Rank Xerox, reported pre-tax
profits for the year to October 31 of Pounds 9.93m, against Pounds 19.3m. An
unchanged final dividend of 18p is proposed for a same-again total of 27p.
