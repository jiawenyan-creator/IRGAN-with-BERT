FT  28 JAN 94 / Observer: Cheap skaters
Trafalgar House's chairmen seem to be getting cheaper by the day. The latest
accounts show that Sir Nigel Broackes got paid Pounds 35,000 for less than
three weeks work, while Alan Clements received Pounds 65,000 for warming the
chair for seven months before Simon Keswick turned up. Keswick's
remuneration works out at less than Pounds 200 per day compared with Pounds
300 per day for Clements and Pounds 1,842.10 a day for Sir Nigel's final few
days in office.
