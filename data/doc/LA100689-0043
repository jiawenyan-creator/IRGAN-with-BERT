POP MUSIC REVIEW; 
ATOMIC PLAYBOYS IN THE LAND OF DISENCHANTMENT 
Opening a show with Led Zep-pelin's classic "Communication Breakdown" can be 
heard either as an act of bravery (it ain't easy takin' on the Mighty Zep) or a 
means of setting an appropriate tone (we're gonna thrash this sucker) for the 
evening. In the strange case of Steve Stevens Atomic Playboys' show at the Roxy 
on Wednesday, all it proved was that the former Billy Idol 
guitarslinger-turned-frontman can put together a unit that's at least as good 
as any other bar band. 
Padded with a spectacularly ill-chosen James Brown selection ("It's a Man's 
Man's Man's World") and an OK version of the Sweet's glamrocka "Action" (the 
latter also found on the quintet's recent album debut), the hour-plus set slid 
slickly into the Land of Disenchantment. Stevens spewed up hot licks like a 
malevolent rock 'n' roll Cuisinart, but none of 'em connected into anything 
resembling an indelible melody or a memorable song. 
Having a charisma-free vocalist is no help, either. Interestingly, the one song 
that Stevens himself sang -- in a rough-hewn, offhanded but not unprofessional 
manner -- lent one of the few glimmers of personality to the proceedings. DON
