FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (34): Rubbing salt into a city's wounds -
Pollution
The river Vistula in Krakow is now saltier than the Baltic sea because of
pollution from the coal mines of Silesia, according to the city's
environmental protection department. Every day, the equivalent of 18 freight
trains of salt, each with 50 cars carrying 20 tonnes, flows past the city.
Now the water in Krakow's new reservoir is deteriorating because of sewage
and fertiliser contamination, and the city could run short of clean water in
three to five years, environmental inspectors fear.
That is just one example of the ravages which Poland's industrialisation has
made on the environment. Most damage is concentrated in the industrial
heartland of the south and west, where air pollution in the late 1980s ran
at five times the national average. Life expectancy for Silesian men is five
to 10 years lower than the national average, at between 65 and 67 years,
inspectors say, and children in particular suffer respiratory diseases.
Mr Andrzej Kassenberg, an ecologist who sits on the environmental advisory
board of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, says:
'Restructuring of the economy provides a huge opportunity not to repeat the
mistakes of the past.' The question now is whether Poland can take that
chance.
In the past three years there has been a dramatic improvement in air
quality, but the cause is the collapse of old industries not environmental
spending. According to Mr Konrad Turzanski, of the environmental protection
inspectorate in Krakow, emissions of dust and sulphur in the region are
around a third of their level in the mid 1980s partly because power plants
are operating at a third of capacity.
But as national figures show, water pollution continues to worsen, and the
problem of disposing of the cities' solid waste is increasing. Meanwhile,
rural areas lag behind: only 5 per cent of households in villages have
plumbing and 2 per cent sewage treatment, compared to around three-quarters
of the total in cities.
Government strategies for tackling these problems have so far had less
impact than economic slump. Poland's elaborate system of environmental
charges and penalties is under strain and only partially enforced.
Under these rules, regions can charge companies for emitting pollution, and
fine them if they break standards. The regional environmental protection
funds which receive the money give 40 per cent to the national environment
fund in Warsaw, 10 per cent to local communities, and then are free to spend
the rest on local projects for improving the environment. The national fund
receives some 7,000bn zlotys a year from pollution charges.
But the funds are handicapped by some companies' inability to pay. According
to Ms Anna Zawiejska, deputy-director of the Katowice environment
department, the coal mines are particular offenders. Nor can they afford to
invest in water treatment plants to remove the salt.
She points out, too, that if a struggling industrial plant which has not
paid its environmental charges is taken over 'the buyer wants any
liabilities to be cancelled'.
The heart of the problem is the threat that environmental spending appears
to pose to jobs. Mr Jerzy Wertz, director of the environmental protection
department in Krakow, estimates that 120,000 people are dependent on the
Nowa Huta steelworks. 'It is by far the most important employer in the
region, he says.
Environmentalists and local government officials say a growing awareness of
that potential conflict, and growing worries about redundancy, have made
people in the region ambivalent or even hostile to environmental
improvement. According to Ms Zawiejska, 'in 1989 Solidarity wanted the
steelworks at Bytom closed. Now they want it to stay open'. Environmental
groups say most interest in 'green' issues is found among educated people in
private companies. They are unlikely to bring political pressure to bear on
these regional dilemmas.
Some of the recent economic restructuring also poses a threat to the
environment. Mr Andrzej Weigle of the National Foundation for Environmental
Protection, a Warsaw-based environmental group, is worried that the
loosening of controls on farmers will lead to more tree-felling.
'In the past, rules were enforced. Now we have to persuade people that it is
in their interest to protect the environment. It is more democratic but
takes longer,' he says.
Hopes for environmental improvement are pinned on a gradual increase in
energy efficiency as more modern factories replace the old, and on better
enforcement of regulations.
Mr Jan Wrobel, a director at the national ministry of environmental
protection, says he can understand environmentalists' fears that companies
invest in Poland to take advantage of lax environmental standards. But in
the long run, he argues, these fears are unjustified: Poland's standards
will be brought up to those of western Europe. 'We do not allow factories to
come into being which break the rules.'
But others remain sceptical. According to Mr Kassenberg, 'my fear is that if
Poland becomes a European tiger, as some people say, air pollution will go
back to where it was'.
