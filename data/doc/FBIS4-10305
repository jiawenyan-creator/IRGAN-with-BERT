  [Text] British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has confirmed 
that British businessmen are interested in associating with the 
Brazilian Petroleum Corporation [Petrobras] to develop the 
investment project for the construction of the Brazil-Bolivia 
oil pipeline. The secretary and entrepreneurs who comprise the 
official British delegation met yesterday with Petrobras 
Financial Director Celando Galvao at the company's headquarters. 
They collected information on the development of the project. 
Hurd deems the project "very creative and appealing to the 
British private capitalists," who are interested in supplying 
technology and equipment. 
  Secretary Hurd had lunch with Brazilian entrepreneurs 
affiliated with the Brazilian-British Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry. In the afternoon, he gave a lecture at the Getulio 
Vargas Foundation about "How to Administer a Changing World: A 
European Point of View." 
  Today the British delegation will leave for Brasilia, where 
they will be received by President Itamar Franco and the 
ministers of finance, mines and energy, and foreign affairs.
