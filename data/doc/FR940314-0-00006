<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final regulation to abolish the Champaign, IL, Federal Wage
System nonappropriated fund (NAF) wage area for pay-setting purposes. With the closing of Chanute Air Force Base
in August 1993, the only NAF employees remaining in the Champaign wage area are those located in Vermilion County,
IL. This regulation assigns Vermilion County to the Marion, IN, NAF wage area.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On November 10, 1993, OPM published an interim rule abolishing the Champaign, IL, Federal Wage System NAF wage area
and assigning Vermilion County, IL, to the Marion, IN, wage area (58 FR 59639). OPM received no comments during the
30-day comment period. However, the interim regulation gave a March 4, 1994, effective date coinciding with the anticipated
effective date of the Marion wage schedule (reflecting the 90-day delay required by law since 1984). Since the publication
of the interim rule, Public Law 103123, which phases out the 90-day delay, was enacted. The new law provides
that wage adjustments will be effective on the later of the normal wage adjustment date for the wage area or the first
day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 1994. The normal wage adjustment dates for both the Champaign
and Marion wage areas were in December 1933. Hence under the new law, wage adjustments for both of these wage areas would
be effective on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 1994. Because of the interim rule
abolishing the Champaign NAF wage area, there is no new wage schedule for Champaign. In order that Vermilion County
employees may receive a pay adjustment in January 1994, as required by Public Law 103123, the effective date
of the wage area redefinition must be changed from March 4, 1994, to January 1, 1994.



Waiver of 30-Day Delay in Effective Date of Final Regulation 



Pursuant to section 553(d)(3) of title 5 of the United States Code, I find that good cause exists to make this amendment
effective in less than 30 days. The regulation is being made effective retroactively to January 1, 1994, so that Vermilion
County employees may receive the pay adjustment required by Public Law 103123.





Regulatory Flexibility Act




I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they will affect only Federal agencies and employees.
