FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Chase applies some polish to its
image - The US bank's move to expand its operations worldwide
THE name remains a legend, but lately it has become a trifle tarnished.
Mr Arthur Ryan, president of Chase Manhattan, is the first to admit the
famous New York-based banking group's image suffered because of errors made
during the 1980s.
But Mr Ryan, highly regarded by Wall Street analysts for his hands-on
management of Chase, is equally keen to point to the recovery he and his
colleagues have engineered since he took over as president in October 1990.
'Two years ago, the bank was clearly in a serious problem state. We were in
more businesses than we should have been. We didn't listen to the market. We
had credit quality problems, and we had to change the broader game plan for
Chase because of a changed business environment,' says Mr Ryan.
The problems were real enough. The bank's return on equity was negative in
1990, following a Dollars 334m loss caused by a Dollars 1.3bn bad debt
provision related to problem commercial property loans.
Annual operating expenses were excessive at 78 per cent of total revenues.
And the bank's ratio of common equity to total assets was an anaemic 3.97
per cent.
'I would have to say that the name of Chase was damaged back in 1990. That's
a fair characterisation. As I travelled around the reaction was 'Chase is
not doing well. What's wrong?'' recalls Mr Ryan, an affable 50-year-old who
made his name building up Chase's profitable retail banking operations.
Mr Ryan also admits that when he took over he found Chase could no longer
rely on the blue-chip cachet of being 'the Rockefeller bank,' a legacy
associated with the tenure of Mr David Rockefeller as chairman and chief
executive in the 1970s.
There was, however, a great deal of sympathy for the Chase name, one of the
legends in world banking. 'What we have done is to turn that into a plus for
us.'
To do that, Mr Ryan, along with the top management and Mr Tom Labrecque,
chairman of Chase, introduced a series of harsh measures. The one that
surprised Wall Street the most came in the autumn of 1990, when Chase halved
its dividend.
The bank also moved to reduce its workforce by 12 per cent to reduce annual
operating costs by Dollars 300m, to sell retail banking businesses in the
UK, Italy and Spain, to dispose of Dollars 400m of UK mortgage assets, and
to sell property assets in Europe, starting with its office building in
Frankfurt.
The cost cuts have proved successful, with staff numbers now at 35,000, some
8,000 lower than the 1990 peak, and the annual operating base Dollars 300m
lower at Dollars 3.8bn, down to 65 per cent of total revenues.
The common equity capital ratio has been strengthened significantly, to 5.04
per cent. And the bank has made heavy bad debt provisions and is working its
way through the problem property loans. Net profits were back to Dollars
520m in 1991 and could rise to Dollars 600m for the whole of 1992.
As Mr Tom Hanley, senior banking analyst at First Boston, puts it: 'The
Chase turnround is progressing on target. The goals that have been set are
clearly being met in terms of asset quality, capital and expense
management.'
But at the heart of the turnround is a strategic redirection of the bank
that is also on track.
Mr Ryan sums it up as an attempt to be strong in domestic retail banking (in
the north-east of the US and not nationwide), while focusing international
operations less on branch networks and more on wholesale businesses, such as
corporate finance, risk management and clearing and information services.
'This kind of strategy has worked well for Deutsche Bank and Union Bank of
Switzerland. It should also work for Chase,' Mr Ryan notes.
Chase's planned turnround is also distinctive from other US banks because
Chase says it does not feel the need to merge with another institution and
would rather concentrate on its chosen market niches.
In earnings terms, Chase's corporate finance made an estimated Dollars 130m
last year, the risk management business produced about Dollars 55m of income
and the Infoserve division, one of the biggest US dollar and D-Mark clearers
in the world, had more than Dollars 100m of profits. These figures compare
with an estimated Dollars 250m from US consumer products, Dollars 90m from
US branch operations and a further Dollars 90m from international private
banking client businesses.
Although these are all improving results, Chase has faced average quarterly
losses from commercial property loans of about Dollars 100m, a level
expected to continue into 1993.
The goal at Chase is to increase revenues from non-US businesses from the
current 34 per cent to half of the total by the middle of the 1990s by
targeting borrowers and investors and offering them a worldwide network of
services.
Mr Ryan reckons only 10 to 15 banks in the world will be truly competitive
players in this range of services, of which only five will be American.
Chase wants to make sure it is among those five.
First Boston's Mr Hanley maintains the goal is realistic: 'If, as I believe,
international banking will come back into favour during the 1990s, then
Chase is one of the best positioned American banks to benefit.'
Wall Street recognises the repositioning of Chase Manhattan has not been
easy - and that it is by no means complete. The bank's stock price reflects
as much.
While it has recovered from its low in 1990 of under Dollars 10 per share,
and has hovered in recently in the range of Dollars 25 to Dollars 27, the
price is still below its 52-week high of Dollars 30 3/8 .
Mr Ryan says he would like to see Chase's relative success at meeting its
goals for the 1990s measured in two ways.
First, he wants to see the bank's return on equity rise to 15 per cent from
its present 11.2 per cent and its annual expenses-to-revenues ratio drop to
60 per cent.
Second: 'We will measure our position as a major global institution by
seeing what the market place says about us,' notes the Chase president.
The aim, therefore, is to burnish a legendary name in world banking.
