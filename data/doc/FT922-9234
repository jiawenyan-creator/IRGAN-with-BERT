FT  08 MAY 92 / Masood snubs Hekmatyar
MR Ahmad Shah Masood, Afghanistan's defence minister, yesterday rejected
demands by Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, his rebel rival, to eject former
government militiamen from the capital, praising them for having helped to
depose the previous regime.
Mr Masood, denouncing Mr Hekmatyar in his first news conference since he
precipitated the collapse of the Soviet-supported government, also vowed to
prevent the radical mujahideen leader making further attacks on Kabul in the
latter's bid for ultimate power in the country.
Some diplomats, however, predicted that the ceasefire would collapse,
particularly given Mr Masood's uncompromising posture. 'Watch the rockets
start falling Saturday morning,' one senior European diplomat said.
'Perhaps, for a short time, Mr Hekmatyar will be able to use his rockets and
kill more innocent people,' Mr Masood said. 'But I assure you that soon we
will push him so far back that his rockets won't reach the capital.'
Mr Masood also claimed that, in addition to removal of the former
government's militia, Mr Hekmatyar was demanding the removal of President
Sibghutullah Mojaddedi.
While confirming that negotiations were going on with Mr Hekmatyar, as part
of a three-day truce that began on Wednesday, Mr Masood made no attempt at
conciliation. He said that political leaders would decide what role Mr
Hekmatyar could play in the government, but made no effort to hide his
contempt for his long-time enemy.
Mr Hekmatyar's refusal to join the government is a big reason why the
mujahideen administration lacks stability.
