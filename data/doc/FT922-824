FT  25 JUN 92 / London Electricity cuts 300 jobs
LONDON Electricity will cut 300 of the 400 jobs in its contracting business
which will halve its turnover by March 1993, the company said at its annual
results meeting yesterday. It will also abandon appliance servicing, as part
of a large restructuring of its non-core businesses.
This news eclipsed the company's 38 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to
Pounds 142.5m, compared with the pro forma pre-tax profit of Pounds 103.3m.
In addition, Mr Andrew Curry, recruited three years ago from Currys, the
electrical retailer, to mastermind retail and contracting, will leave the
company. He will be succeeded by his deputy, Mr Clive Vlotman, formerly of
Dixons. London said the restructuring of contracting would leave the trading
division too small to require a main board director.
The 38 per cent increase in profits was achieved in spite of a Pounds 17m
loss from contracting, including Pounds 11.4m of provisions for future
redundancies and restructuring.
The retail business also incurred a loss, of Pounds 11.5m, in spite of a 20
per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 33m. This included exceptional costs
as London continued to restructure the business by opening superstores and
shops within Debenhams stores to replace old-style outlets.
Mr Roger Urwin, chief executive, said retail and contracting would break
even in the year to March 1993.
Losses in retail and contracting meant most of the company's Pounds 137.3m
operating profit was generated by its main business, electricity
distribution, which made Pounds 158.3m compared with Pounds 97.2m the
previous year.
This was primarily to a 10.9 per cent increase in electricity tariffs in
April 1991.
