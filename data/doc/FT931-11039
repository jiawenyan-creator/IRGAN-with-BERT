FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Saudi British Bank plans
flotation
SAUDI British Bank, the Riyadh-based joint-venture bank 40 per cent owned by
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, is to float 1.2m shares on Saudi
Arabia's stock market from February 13 to raise its paid-up capital by 150
per cent to SR1bn (Dollars 266m).
HSBC will buy a further 800,000 shares in the issue to retain its present
holding.
Bankers in Riyadh said the shares would be offered at SR570, a SR100 face
value price plus a premium of SR470. The bank will also offer existing
shareholders 4m free shares, one-for-one, paid for from reserves. This is
likely to halve the share's present market price, presently just over
SR1,500, offering a substantial premium after the flotation.
Saudi Arabia's stock market has eased from its buoyant peaks last year,
partly as a result of a slew of new issues, but bankers expect the Saudi
British issue to be heavily subscribed. 'Some extraordinary figures have
been bandied around,' said one.
Saudi British Bank, the Kingdom's fourth-largest, recently reported a 7 per
cent rise in net profits for 1992 to SR268.1m, but sees last years' figures
as the end of a period of recovery and restructuring.
The bank has doubled its balance sheet size since 1988 and is thought to
require the additional capital to expand further. The bank says it is
looking to capitalise on the continued buoyancy of both the consumer market
and private sector in the kingdom since the end of the Gulf war.
