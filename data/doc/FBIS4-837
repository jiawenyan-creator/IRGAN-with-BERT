  [Text] Police in Johannesburg say four men claiming to be 
members of the Inkatha Freedom Party were found by police held 
captive in the basement of a building that houses the regional 
offices of the ANC. A police spokesman said the four, three of 
them elderly, and a 14-year-old were found after a fifth man who 
said he had escaped alerted a police patrol. The police 
spokesman said ANC officials told them the men were held as they 
attempted to break into a car outside the building, and that the 
police arrived before the ANC had time to alert them. 
  The ANC was not immediately available for comment, but the 
movement's regional chairman, Mr. Tokyo Sexwale, promised a 
statement later in the day. He also promised a full internal 
investigation and disciplinary measures within 24 hours if there 
was any wrongdoing by ANC security staff in the building.
