FT  15 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hawtal Whiting
Hawtal Whiting Holdings, the engineering consulting services group, made a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 197,000 in 1991 and is unlikely to be profitable in
the first half of the current year.
The dividend is cut from 4p to 0.1p.
Mr John Whitecross, chairman, said the group suffered some cutbacks in work
towards the end of December and into January this year that led to
reorganising the business into three geographical sectors.
Activity was below the 1991 level, and with long lead times in arranging
contracts 'we do not foresee any improvement at least until later in the
year'.
The 1991 profit compared with Pounds 6,000, restated after adjustments of
Pounds 879,000 resulting from incorrect accruals by the North American
operations. Action had been taken to change the financial management and
controls.
Turnover came to Pounds 63.4m (Pounds 60.9m). Trading remained difficult as
customers reorganised their businesses and product strategies in response to
the world-wide slump in car sales.
After tax credit Pounds 41,000 (charge Pounds 446,000) and higher minority
deficit, losses per share were 0.93p (7.8p).
