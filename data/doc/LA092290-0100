METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JOURNALISM PROFESSOR WINS BACK ADVISER POST 
A Cal Poly Pomona journalism professor who was removed as faculty adviser to 
the school paper after the paper printed articles critical of the school's 
administration has won his fight for reinstatement. 
David C. Henley, 54, a tenured professor, was offered his adviser job back last 
week and received a letter of apology from Cal Poly's administration. His job 
as head of the school's journalism department was unaffected by the adviser 
flap. 
Cal Poly Pomona officials said Henley opted not to return to the student 
newspaper until the 1991-92 school year because another adviser already had 
been hired for this year.
