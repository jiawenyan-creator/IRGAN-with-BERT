WESTSIDE DIGEST: MALIBU; 
COUNCIL LIMITS MEETINGS 
Malibu's unofficial City Council voted Tuesday to meet twice monthly instead of 
weekly, beginning in November. 
With the selection of a city attorney, an interim city manager and City Hall 
space behind them, several council members said there was little point in 
continuing to meet weekly until incorporation occurs. However, the council 
decided to begin the new schedule in November because agenda items have already 
been set for three Tuesdays in October.
