SENIOR RENTAL UNITS DEDICATED 
The first major senior citizen apartment complex in Santa Fe Springs has been 
dedicated by Mayor Ronald Kernes and other city officials at 10829 S. Fulton 
Wells Ave. 
Heritage Village Santa Fe Springs, by Calmark Development Co., has 280 
non-subsidized units in two-story garden apartment buildings. Rental rates 
average $535 a month for one-bedroom units and $660 for two-bedroom ones. 
Tenants must be 55 and over. 
Amenities include a swimming pool, two spas and two clubhouses. West Los 
Angeles-based Calmark reportedly is the Southland's largest builder of 
non-subsidized affordable senior rental housing.
