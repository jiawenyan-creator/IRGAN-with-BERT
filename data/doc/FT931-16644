FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: Car companies plan big capital
spending in Spain
FOREIGN motor companies, notably Renault and Suzuki, plan extensive capital
spending in Spain.
Renault, the French car manufacturer, is to invest Pta60bn (Dollars 526m) in
its Spanish subsidiary Fasa-Renault. Japan's Suzuki plans a Pta27bn
viability plan for Santana Motor, the loss-making four-wheel vehicle
producer it controls in Spain.
The planned investments coincide with a forecast of a 5 per cent drop in
Spanish vehicle sales this year after an estimated rise of 8.3 per cent to
961,000 sold units in 1992.
The forecast comes as all the main car manufacturers, except General Motors,
have introduced short working weeks to reduce stocks.
Anfac, the car manufacturer's association, estimates Spanish car exports
will be hard hit this year after growing by just 0.9 per cent between
January-October 1992.
Exports over the first 10 months of 1991 grew by 20 per cent.
The Fasa-Renault investment, to be spread over six years and incorporate
unspecified subsidies, is understood to involve the development of a new
high-powered diesel engine, likely to be built at its Valladolid plant.
