Program Expectations 


Each project funded under this demonstration grant program is expected to identify, with the assistance of schools
and other local organizations within the local community, a cohort of 15 to 20 disadvantaged students for participation
in activities in the first year of the grant. These students are to be involved in a year-round program designed to expose
them to the various primary care fields through on-site and community experiences, provide them with necessary prerequisite
skills in mathematics, science and communication (i.e., reading, writing, and oral skills), and stimulate and reinforce
their interest in their own health and in providing care in underserved communities. The students are to continue
with the project each year, participating in age-appropriate activities as they advance through secondary school.
It is anticipated that the level of activity will be more intense during the summer months than during the academic
year. 
Projects are to provide activities to build participants' self-esteem; nurture the development of peer counseling
skills, and the formation of a corps of peer counselors; foster the participants' interest in health care careers;
impact their educational and subject choices; influence them to select a health career track; 
cultivate their awareness of and interest in primary care; and nurture their development into community responsive,
culturally competent primary care health professionals committed to serving the underserved.
