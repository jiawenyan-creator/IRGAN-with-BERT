METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: KIDNAPING IN MEXICO DRAWS MAXIMUM TERM 
A Covina chiropractor who engineered the kidnaping of his ex-lover's daughter 
in Mexico was sentenced Monday to more than 19 years in prison -- the maximum 
-- and ordered to pay more than $500,000 in fines and restitution. 
Rolando Peralta was indicted under a novel use of a federal law against 
international hostage-taking. He was convicted late last year of kidnaping. 
The abduction of Maria Robleto, 22, a dental student at a technical college in 
Mexico City on June 15, 1989, stemmed from a soured personal and business 
relationship between her mother and Peralta, the indictment said.
