FT  01 SEP 94 / Castro may go to war, says report
President Fidel Castro may opt for war with the US if he is backed into a
corner, said a study prepared for the Pentagon and released yesterday,
Reuter reports from Washington.
The study by Rand, a California research organisation, was completed last
spring and anticipated the anti-government demonstrations and refugee exodus
of recent weeks.
It said Mr Castro was unlikely to accept a forced resignation because it
would tarnish his place in history.
'Castro is not likely to give up power voluntarily; and if cornered he might
fight to the death,' said the report, paid for by the office of Mr William
Perry, defence secretary.
'With his regime at the point of unravelling, Castro might try to engineer a
final military reckoning with the US in a Gotterdammerung-type scenario that
could leave Cuba destroyed but would confirm his legacy as Latin America's
staunchest anti-imperialist,' it said.
Such an outcome, the study insisted, 'conforms not only to the value that
Castro places on struggle, intransigence, and defiance, but also the way he
and past Cuban leaders have exalted the acts of death and martyrdom on
behalf of the nation.' The Cuban leader might seek a clash over the Florida
Straits, which separate Florida and Cuba by 90 miles, or over Guantanamo
Bay, the US naval base on Cuba's southeast shore.
His grip on power remained firm, with the Communist party apparatus,
military and security organs 'largely in the hands of hardline officers',
the report said. Clinton administration officials have said they are not
committed to ousting Mr Castro. Instead, they have tightened a 31-year-old
US trade embargo against Cuba to force him towards meaningful economic and
political reforms.
The Rand report concluded that such reforms were highly unlikely while Mr
Castro remained in power.
