FT  10 APR 92 / Russian MPs put pressure on Yeltsin
MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, today faces a resolution in the
Congress of People's Deputies condemning the economic policy of his
government and demanding changes in the memorandum on reform it has thrashed
out with the International Monetary Fund.
Mr Yeltsin, who has sat stony-faced through a barrage of criticism for the
past two days, said yesterday he may choose to speak today in reply  -
though he said he may give his response 'after the Congress', implying he
might appeal to the population at large.
The resolution does not call for the government to resign. But the price of
staying in power is high.
The resolution foresees the eventual stripping from Mr Yeltsin of his
special powers to bring in laws by decree and to monopolise the appointment
of ministers.
At the same time, further concessions may be wrung from an already grossly
strained budget.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, gave a short and
well-received speech, in which he told the deputies that the government
would delay the energy price rises (set for June) and instead raise prices
by stages, and would raise pension and social security benefits and lower
taxes. He claimed that the budget deficit had been kept to 1.5 per cent of
the gross domestic product in the first quarter of the year - a figure much
lower than that calculated by foreign economists.
The final clause in the resolution says that 'the congress states to the
world community its decisive and firm intention to continue the policy of
economic reform'.
But it adds that that specific corrections must be made in the programme
submitted by the government to the IMF, and that a parliamentary delegation
would meet IMF representatives to clarify their position on the economy.
