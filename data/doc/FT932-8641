FT  18 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: M&amp;G Group
Investors who bought M&amp;G's shares as a geared investment in the UK stock
market had their faith rewarded by its half-year performance. A 28 per cent
increase in funds under management represented an impressive performance
when matched against the 16 per cent rise in the London market over the same
period. The virtues of the group's old fashioned emphasis on high-yielding
income and recovery stocks became apparent as the UK began to emerge from
recession. Its recovery fund recorded a 34 per cent rise in value following
a resurgence of interest in industrial companies.
The unsettling aspect of M&amp;G's results, however, was the disappointing level
of net unit trust sales at just Pounds 4m. Overall, unit trust sales grew by
47 per cent but redemptions were also sharply higher. There has recently
been high turnover in the unit trust industry as a whole. It may simply be
that, with equities finally recovering their historic highs, some investors
are cashing in their chips. But even though the trend is improving, M&amp;G is
sufficiently concerned to start researching the phenomenon.
Such worries may dampen the surge in M&amp;G's shares, which have outperformed
the market by 16 per cent since the start of the year. Sentiment may be
further damaged by the Office of Fair Trading's proposals requiring
independent financial advisers to reveal commission payments. This may not
help M&amp;G, which is heavily reliant on this distribution channel.
