FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: US healthcare group profits
ahead 16%
Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US healthcare group that has recently agreed to buy
Eastman Kodak's diagnostic products division and the Neutrogena skin care
company, saw a 16 per cent increase in net profits in the third quarter in
spite of a big rise in its tax charge.
Growth was led by the pharmaceuticals division, which lifted sales by 21 per
cent because of strong performances from new drugs. The division had sales
of Dollars 1.3bn.
Overall, group sales rose by 15 per cent to Dollars 4.04bn, of which 2
percentage points were attributable to the recent weakness of the dollar
against other currencies.
International sales advanced by 22 per cent - much faster than domestic
sales, which rose by 9 per cent.
Pre-tax profits rose by 22.5 per cent, but after the increase in the tax
charge, earnings per share were 17 per cent ahead at 82 cents.
