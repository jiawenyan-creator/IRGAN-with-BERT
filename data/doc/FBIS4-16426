  [Text] Moscow April 15 -- The CIS heads of state adopted a 
statement on the Georgian-Agkhazian conflict and Russia agreed 
to send its peace-keepers to the region where CSCE and UN 
observers will also be staying, Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
told a joint press conference of CIS heads of state on Friday. 
  Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze quoted several points 
from the statement which he thought were fundamentally 
important. Among them he listed an appeal to the UN Security 
Council to urgently decide on carrying out a peacekeeping 
operation in Abkhazia. 
  "If, for some reason, such a decision is not adopted in the 
near future, the CIS countries-parties to common defence treaty, 
are ready to send to the area their own peacekeeping forces upon 
agreement with the two warring sides", Shevardnadze said.
