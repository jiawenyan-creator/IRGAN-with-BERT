FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: SE commitment to small shareholders
criticised
The Stock Exchange was yesterday criticised by one of its non-executive
directors, who resigned earlier this week, for neglecting private
shareholders in favour of global and institutional investors.
Mr David Jones, chief executive of Sharelink Investment Services, the
Birmingham-based share dealing company, called for a 'top to bottom' review
at the exchange to help lift the profile of smaller shareholders.
After stepping down from the Stock Exchange board, which he only joined in
April, Mr Jones said: 'I've been getting at them for six years that they
need to step up their commitment to private investors. I'm still waiting for
the exchange to do something concrete.'
He denied, however, that his resignation was linked to any differences with
the board, on which he was expected to serve a three-year term.
In a statement, the Stock Exchange said Mr Jones wanted to devote his time
to Sharelink and the advisory committee on Crest, the electronic settlement
system under development by the Bank of England.
In recent months Sharelink has been dogged by low volumes and made a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 468,000 in the six months to September 30. Although there had
been a pick-up in orders from some investors, Mr Jones said trading remained
poor.
