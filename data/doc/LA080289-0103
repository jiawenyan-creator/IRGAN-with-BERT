INDONESIA CRACKS DOWN ON PIRATED COMPUTER SOFTWARE 
Pirated copies of computer software were pulled off store shelves Tuesday as a 
copyright protection agreement took effect between the United States and 
Indonesia. 
The price of an edition of Lotus Development Corp. software shot up overnight 
from $1.50 for a bogus copy to $422 for the Cambridge, Mass., manufacturer's 
original version. 
In anticipation of the change, last-minute shoppers packed a central Jakarta 
computer store Saturday and Monday, snapping up all pirated software manuals in 
stock at unadvertised discounts, the store manager said. 
"We were packed. You could not move in here. The expatriates were more panicked 
than the local people on this," he said. 
The store was deserted Tuesday. Master copies of pirated software were locked 
away "for our collection," the store manager said. Legitimate versions of 
WordStar 5 and Lotus 1-2-3, third release, were displayed for sale. 
Several store managers contacted Tuesday said they had no software for sale, 
only hardware. 
"Bigger stores that sell software as a sideline do not want to take the risk," 
one store manager said. 
It was unclear whether small shops that specialize exclusively in pirated 
software would continue operating somehow. Spokesmen for the police and the 
Attorney General's Office were not available for comment. 
A prominent computer dealer suggested that U.S. software producers drop their 
prices to match the spending power of people in developing nations.
