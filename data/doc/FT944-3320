FT  14 DEC 94 / MPs hit at MoD closure plans
Plans to close Ministry of Defence stores and cut hundreds of jobs were
fundamentally flawed, unsafe and designed to avoid public scrutiny, the
cross-party Commons Defence Committee said yesterday.
The committee's report says it was 'disturbed' that the ministry had decided
to proceed with a single option to the exclusion of any detailed
consideration of others.
Mr David Clark, the shadow defence secretary, said: 'Clearly, the Defence
Cost Study is fundamentally flawed and there was no proper examination of
the various options.
'It is quite clear from this report that the study was purely to save money
and that there was little account taken of our strategic defence needs.'
The committee's report on plans for naval stores announced in the July 14
Defence Cost Study attacked the lack of consultation documents and the
ministry's refusal to release the actual study report.
'We can only assume from the amount of work which has had to be carried out
subsequently that it was not as full and searching a review as it should
have been,' the committee's report said.
Under the plan, depots at Eaglescliffe in Cleveland and Exeter and Wrangaton
in Devon will be shut, holdings at Devonport and Rosyth cut, and a central
store will be created at Portsmouth, with a northern equivalent at Faslane
on the Clyde.
But the committee's report criticised failure to carry full investment
appraisals of alternative options until after officials gave evidence to it
in October.
'Without the results of that investment appraisal it was unsafe for MoD to
have reached a conclusion,' the committee said.
The committee added that while the procedure by which the conclusion was
reached was fundamentally flawed, the conclusion itself appeared to be
sound.
