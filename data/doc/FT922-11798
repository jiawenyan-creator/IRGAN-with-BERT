FT  23 APR 92 / Observer: Bearring up
Compared with Chernobyl, Chelyabinsk has the added disadvantage that its
nuclear disaster was kept hushed up by the ex-Soviet authorities. And the
fact that, over 30 years later, it is now receiving help owes much to Lady
Gillian Braithwaite, wife of British ambassador Sir Rodric, who returns with
him from Russia next month when he becomes foreign affairs adviser to the
prime minister.
Besides having stood up to be counted in the tank-ringed Russian parliament
building on the critical night of August 20, she recently joined Lady Ellen
Dahrendorf, Lady Valerie Solti and others in founding Bearr - the British
Emergency Aid in Russia and the Republics Trust.
It has already wheedled six tonnes of medicines out of UK-based
pharmaceutical companies and sent them to Chelyabinsk, still suffering from
the effects of severe irradiation. Indeed, its main hospital was within a
day or so of completely running out of medical supplies when the Bearr truck
arrived with enough to eke out another two months.
While the trust is working to send more, there seems no doubt that Russia
will lose a resourceful resident with Lady Braithwaite's departure. Still,
perhaps she'll henceforth be close enough to Britain's cabinet to give
off-stage help to the country she's leaving.
