FT  10 MAY 93 / People: Ugland to take over chair of ship repairers
Andreas O Ugland, a member of the Norwegian shipping family and chairman of
Ugland Brothers, the UK-based ship management company, has been appointed
chairman-designate of Bristol Channel Ship Repairers.
Ugland is expected to take over the chairmanship in the autumn when Bristol
Channel's current chairman, Christopher Bailey, steps down.
His appointment appears to mark the end of a sometimes acrimonious battle
for control of the group waged over the past nine months.
Ugland is Bristol Channel's largest shareholder. It has built up a 24.19 per
cent stake, the bulk of which was acquired in July when the company bought
18m shares from CH Bailey, which also operates dry dock facilities in the
Bristol Channel. This cut Bailey's holding to 8.21 per cent.
In March a bid by Ugland to seize control of the board at an extraordinary
meeting was backed by shareholders but foiled when Bailey called a surprise
board meeting the day before the EGM and appointed five new directors.
However, it appears that since then the two sides have reached a better
understanding. John Love, one of three Ugland directors on the board, says
Bailey had recognised that the move was in the best interest of all the
shareholders.
