  [Text] Chisinau May 31 TASS -- Igor Smirnov, president of 
the unrecognised Dniester republic, extended on Tuesday, by his 
decree, the state of emergency in the republic by another month, 
which was imposed on last January 18. 
  The document notes that this was done "to strengthen 
statehood, public security and to control organised crime". 
  Speaking on Monday evening over local television, Smirnov 
said that a terrorist act, as a result of which Dniester 
Prosecutor Boris Luchik was seriously wounded and his wife 
killed, was another reason to stiffen measures on crime control. 
  In the opinion of the Dniester leader, some quarters in 
Moldavia [Moldova] were interested in the prosecutor's 
assassination and an attempt to destabilise the situation in the 
Dniester left bank areas (where the Dniester republic is 
situated). 
  According to the president, they bring pressure on Tiraspol, 
including economic one, together with some representatives from 
the Russian leadership [sentence as received]. 
  The aim of these actions is to force the Dniester leaders to 
make concessions on the withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army, its 
property and settlement of the Dniester problem, Smirnov said. 
  He blamed Moscow and Chisinau for the difficult financial 
situation in the region. 
  According to Smirnov, the Russian leadership did not permit 
to take Dniester coupons, the new currency issued at the Russian 
mint. This money is very necessary to pay pensions and wages to 
Dniester citizens. 
  Smirnov confirmed that the Dniester republic has currency 
accounts at banks of Austria and other European countries.
