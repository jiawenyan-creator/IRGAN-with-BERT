The Office of Pipeline Regulation (OPR) will convene a cultural resources compliance training course. This course
is being held so that the regulated pipeline industry and interested individuals and/or organizations can gain an

under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and other historic preservation laws and regulations; and
&bull;What cultural resources information the industry needs to file with the Commission pre- and post-issuance
of a FERC certificate.



Interested organizations and the public are urged to take advantage of this course.
Course discussion will include the following topics:



&bull;Objectives and requirements of the Commission regarding compliance with 106 of the NHPA and related
historic preservation laws;
&bull;Guidance for reporting on cultural resources investigations;
&bull;Definition of cultural resources terms used by FERC in the compliance process; and
&bull;Efficient strategies for planning and conducting cultural resources investigations.
