  [Text] Haikou, June 16 (XINHUA) -- The United Nations 
Children's Fund (UNICEF) has played an active role in China's 
health education program in recent years. 
  From 1990 to 1993, it provided 1.2 million U.S. dollars to 
aid the program. 
  China started the health education program in the early 
1980s. The program is aimed at popularization of health 
knowledge to change unhealthy living habits and behavior. 
  With the improvement of medical conditions, epidemic 
diseases 
have been on the decline, but some chronic diseases such as 
heart disease and high blood pressure have increased. 
  In 1994-95, UNICEF invested another 800,000 U.S. dollars in 
the program to be carried out in 18 provinces and regions 
including Hainan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Gansu, Tibet, 
Qinghai, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and Guangxi. 
  According to an official from UNICEF who is attending a 
training class under the health education program in Haikou, 
capital of Hainan Province, UNICEF's aid program also involves 
women's and children's health education, epidemic prevention, 
and endemic disease prevention.
