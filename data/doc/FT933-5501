FT  03 SEP 93 / Anti-pollution talks deadlock
Environmental talks on reducing sulphur emissions are due to end today, with
no agreement on target cuts, writes Frances Williams in Geneva.
A week of negotiations has failed to bridge the gap between nations seeking
big reductions by the end of the decade, such as Germany and the Nordic
countries, and those, including Britain, which want less demanding targets
over a longer period. The 30-nation talks are aimed at hammering out a new
sulphur protocol on long-range air pollution.
