SOLITUDE CLOSE TO THE WELL-TROD PATH 
Getting there: The North and South rims of the Grand Canyon can be reached from 
Las Vegas and Phoenix, both of which are served by most major U.S. airlines. 
Train service is available to the South Rim from Williams, and bus service from 
Flagstaff and Williams. 
Where to stay: To avoid the heaviest crowds, the first choice would be the 
North Rim: 
 -- Grand Canyon Lodge: About 280 rustic cabins are clustered around a gorgeous 
old lodge. Two-person cabins cost $45 to $60 a night. For reservations, contact 
TW Recreational Services, P.O. Box 400, Cedar City, Utah 84720, (801) 586-7686. 
 -- A Park Service campground has 82 sites with showers nearby, but no hookups 
for recreational vehicles. Cost is $6 per night plus a reservation charge. 
Ticketron handles reservations: (900) 370-7070. 
 -- Kaibab Lodge: Rustic-looking and very inviting lodge in a broad meadow six 
miles north of the Grand Canyon, open mid-May to mid-October. Accommodations 
are in 24 small cabins. Rates for two: $40-$55 a night. For reservations: (800) 
525-0924. 
There's no escaping the crowds at Grand Canyon Village on the South Rim. Still, 
it is a jumping-off place for rim and inner-canyon hikes:

cabins to luxury hotel rooms. Rates for two range from $40 a night at Bright 
Angel Lodge to $90-$300 a night at El Tovar, the luxury hotel. For
