FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps lift Bodycote 16% to
Pounds 6.4m
BODYCOTE International, the metal technology, packaging and textiles group,
reported a 16 per cent increase from Pounds 5.52m to Pounds 6.4m, in pre-tax
profits for the six months to June 30.
The increase partly reflected the acquisition in March of Industrial
Materials Technology, which has two plants in the US, and IMT Europe, based
in Belgium, from National Forge Company of Delaware.
The two acquisitions contributed about Pounds 600,000 to profits.
Despite the current economic conditions the group said all its divisions
continued to trade satisfactorily, showing increases in both profit and
turnover.
Turnover showed an advance of 14 per cent from Pounds 32.6m to Pounds 37.3m
and earnings per share increased to 14.5p (13.4p).
The interim dividend goes up to 3.75p (3.5p).
The metal technology division, which now accounts for 62 per cent of group
profits, is expected to continue to be the main source of future growth.
With nil gearing at present the group said the second half should show a
healthy liquidity position, despite a Pounds 5.5m capital investment
programme this year.
