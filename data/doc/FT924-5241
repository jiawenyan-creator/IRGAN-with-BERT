FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Tomkinsons shows 18% fall to Pounds 1m
Tomkinsons, the yarn and carpet group, blamed the 'continuing low level of
consumer confidence and spending' for an 18 per cent decline in annual
profits.
On turnover down to Pounds 19.7m (Pounds 21.3m), the pre-tax line for the 12
months to October 3 fell from Pounds 1.28m to Pounds 1.05m.
However, Mr Lowry Maclean, chairman, described the performance as
'steadfast'. Gross margins were fractionally stronger, he said, reflecting
control of production costs and sales prices.
Although overseas markets remained difficult, exports increased by 13.5 per
cent.
A proposed final dividend of 8p maintains the total at 11.5p, uncovered by
earnings of 10.3p (13.9p) per share.
