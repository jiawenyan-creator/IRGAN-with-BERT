FT  09 DEC 94 / Budget Statement: Northern Rock first to lift rate -
Mortgage increase
Less than an hour after Mr Kenneth Clarke stood up to deliver his
mini-Budget, Northern Rock became the first mortgage lender to announce a
rise in its home loan rate after the 0.5 percentage point increase in base
interest rates on Wednesday.
From December 19 the standard variable rate at the UK's 10th largest society
will go up by 0.4 percentage points to 8.54 per cent. About 230,000 of the
society's 250,000 borrowers pay this rate. The move will add Pounds 11 a
month to payments for a Pounds 40,000 loan. Mr Adam Applegarth, general
manager, said Northern Rock had felt it prudent to wait until after Mr
Clarke's statement to respond.
Other mortgage lenders did not follow suit yesterday, but Northern Rock's
move adds to the pressure for increases.
