Pacificorp Makes New Cash Bid for Pinnacle: Pacificorp renewed its pursuit of 
Pinnacle West Capital Corp. with a sweetened, all-cash offer of $1.8 billion 
that will be hard to resist. Phoenix-based Pinnacle West, which owns Arizona 
Public Service Co., an electric and gas utility, had rejected three previous 
takeover offers from Pacificorp, a Portland, Ore.-based utility.
