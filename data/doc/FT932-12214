FT  29 APR 93 / Observer: From post to pillar
To most managers of Britain's sub-post offices the idea of one day having
Cazenove as brokers and Warburgs as advisers must be at best a remote
prospect. Certainly Frank Buckley couldn't have expected to become a pillar
of the business establishment when he bought his sub office in Bispham, near
Blackpool, in 1969.
Today, of course, he is chairman of BTP, the former British Tar Products,
which has just paid Pounds 100m for most of the assets of run-down
fine-chemicals company MTM.
Buckley took the Bispham shop after quitting Allied Chemical Corp of the US,
fed up with the conformism of American corporate life. Then an old buddy
working with PA Consulting Group asked him to help sell the City a line.
At the time British Tar's shares were languishing at 1s 3d apiece. He was
given the aim of doubling the price to half a crown by writing a script
extolling the glowing future lying before investors in tar.
In the event, the writing never got done. Instead he went on to transform
BTP into a significant exporter.
Such success has its costs, of course. The past week has been purgatory for
the sprightly 64-year-old with a bon viveur appetite and a love of claret.
Locked in negotiations within the walls of Warburgs, he has been kept on
iron rations of sandwiches and pizza.
