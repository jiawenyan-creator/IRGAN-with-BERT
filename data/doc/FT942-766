FT  28 JUN 94 / Labour pledges nurseries for all
Labour would provide nursery education for three-to-four-year-olds within
five years, according to a policy document written by Ms Ann Taylor, shadow
education secretary and supported by Mr Tony Blair, the favourite for the
Labour leadership.
The document, expected to be submitted to Labour's ruling National Executive
Committee tomorrow, accepts the principle of testing.
