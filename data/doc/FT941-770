FT  29 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Brussels telecoms challenge to Bonn
The European Commission has increased pressure on Bonn to stop dealing
bilaterally with the US on opening up the German telecommunications market,
by formally challenging Germany's legal compliance with the EU directive on
public procurement.
The challenge was spelled out in a letter last week to Mr Gunter Rexrodt,
German economics minister, by Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Raniero Vanni
d'Archirafi, trade and internal market commissioners.
The letter questions whether the four-year-old directive has been fully
enacted in German law and asks Mr Rexrodt for swift clarification. If there
is no satisfactory reply by early next month, Brussels will consider taking
legal action.
Economics ministry officials in Bonn said they hoped to settle amicably
their differences with the Commission. These were sparked when the US
dropped trade sanctions against Germany last month, after Bonn indicated it
would not apply Article 29 of the EU public procurement directive.
This gives European bidders for public contracts a 3 per cent price
preference and allows tenders with less than 50 per cent local content to be
ignored. The US and Germany say this is overridden by a 1954 'friendship
agreement'.
The issue coincides with signs that the fate of separate US and EU
negotiations on liberalising public procurement may hinge on talks at next
month's Gatt meeting in Marrakesh.
Stalemate persists over EU demands that the US repeal Buy American laws in
exchange for opening European telecommunications and power equipment markets
fully to US bidders. But there is growing optimism in Brussels after an
offer by Washington to raise from 24 to 36 the number of states ready to
open public procurement to international competition.
