FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Zinc price helps Cominco
turnround
A SHARP rise in zinc prices helped push Cominco, the Canadian base metals
and fertiliser producer, back into the black in the second quarter.
Earnings were CDollars 18.1m (USDollars 15m), or 22 cents a share, up from
CDollars 7.3m, or eight cents a share, a year earlier.
Cominco suffered a CDollars 4.9m loss in the first quarter of 1992. Sales
advanced to CDollars 416.6m from CDollars 386.1m.
The zinc price was about 20 per cent higher in the second quarter than a
year earlier. Operating profit from mining and minerals climbed to CDollars
146.1m from CDollars 132m. Fertiliser volumes were higher, but were offset
by a continued slide in prices. Operating profit from fertilisers advanced
to CDollars 22.4m from CDollars 18.1m.
Rio Algom, a diversified Canadian mining group formerly 51 per cent
controlled by RTZ, recorded higher second-quarter earnings with better
potash and copper results and a favourable exchange rate.
Profits were CDollars 8.2m, or 17 cents a share, against CDollars 6.4m, or
13 cents a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 264m against CDollars 267m.
First-half earnings dipped to CDollars 13m, or 27 cents a share, from
CDollars 20.4m, or 44 cents, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 507m
against CDollars 540m.
