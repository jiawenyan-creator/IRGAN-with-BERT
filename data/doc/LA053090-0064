Bad Signs: The stars won't shine on the upcoming summit, predicts Joan Quigley, 
White House astrologer to the Reagans. She claims that she set times for former 
President Ronald Reagan's jet to take off and his meetings with Soviet 
President Mikhail Gorbachev. 
She asserts that President George Bush and Gorbachev "will not see eye to eye 
in the way Reagan and Gorbachev did, or get along as harmoniously." 
Blood Lines: Norway's parliament Tuesday scrapped the rules giving royal sons 
first rights to the throne. Princess Martha Louise, 18, will not, however, 
precede her younger brother, Prince Haakon Magnus, 16, in succession because 
the rule applies only to heirs born after 1990. They both are grandchildren of 
King Olav, 86. 
Eye on the Court: Justice William Brennan Jr. thinks televising Supreme Court 
sessions is inevitable. "I would love it. I'm the only one presently of the 
nine who would allow television broadcasts of our actual proceedings," he said 
in a recent magazine interview. 
No Hate: Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has clarified his views about homosexuals. 
"I was taught from the time I was a little boy to hate the sin and love the 
sinner," he told the Charlotte, N.C., Observer. "But the way these people 
conduct themselves makes the second half of that mighty difficult sometimes." 
He objects to the use of the word gay to describe homosexuals, saying, "I 
resent the corruption of a very fine word." Compiled by YEMI TOURE
