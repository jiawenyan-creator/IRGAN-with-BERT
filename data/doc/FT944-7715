FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Price cuts take their toll on
NTT profits
NTT, Japan's largest telecommunications company, suffered a 66 per cent fall
in non-consolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax -
in the first half, largely as a result of price cuts.
NTT, which was listed in New York and London this year, said sales dropped 2
per cent to Y2,856.7bn from a previous Y2,911.6bn mainly because of
significant price cuts on long-distance calls, where NTT faces growing
competition from recently established telecoms companies. Recurring profits
fell to Y35.5bn (Dollars 360m) from Y103.9bn.
A maximum price cut of 10 per cent was introduced on the longest routes,
depressing first-half revenues by Y95bn. This was an improvement, however,
on the Y135bn impact the company had forecast.
Sales of equipment, such as phones for business and home users, were also
lower because of tough competition, although sales of facsimile machines
increased.
NTT saw its cost base rise in its telecommunications business as it spun off
various businesses which had been conducted in-house, and depreciated fixed
assets such as digitalised switches and fibre-optic cables being introduced
in preparation for advanced communications services.
NTT expects increased competition in the long-distance sector will continue
to affect results in the second half. The company is planning to apply to
the ministry of posts and telecommunications for a rise in basic telephone
charges.
Revenues for the full year are expected to rise to Y5,826bn from a previous
Y5,809bn, helped by revenues from pre-paid telephone cards which are
expected to total Y72.4bn.
Costs, however, are forecast to rise by about Y5bn in the second half as a
result of a voluntary retirement programme and higher depreciation costs,
taking recurring profits down to Y104bn from a previous Y109.5bn. Net
profits are forecast at Y45bn against Y41.4bn.
