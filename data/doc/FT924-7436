FT  17 NOV 92 / Egypt in companies shake-up
EGYPT has announced long-delayed plans to shake up publicly owned companies
to help inject competitiveness into the country's ailing state economy,
Reuter reports from Cairo.
However, some western economists said the moves, which should have taken
effect in May, might be further delayed by a valuation of the companies'
assets and liabilities, the first step towards privatising them.
The 27 holding companies set up last year to manage the large public sector
will be reduced to 20 or 18, with each handling a portfolio of companies in
competing industries, officials say.
Each holding company at the present time handles all the affiliates in a
particular sector.
In some cases such as cement, where the public sector is the main local
supplier, the holding com-pany has been able to set its own monopoly prices.
'The goals are to break up monopolies ..and balance them between each other,
to prevent the parent companies from intervening too much in their
affiliates and give most power to the management,' Mr Atef Sedki, prime
minister, told al-Ahram newspaper on Monday.
Western donors backing Egypt's economic reforms with Dollars 10bn of debt
forgiveness have pressed for public flotations for nearly a year.
