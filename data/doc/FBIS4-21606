  [Text] Brussels, March 22, RIA -- According to a diplomatic 
source in the Eurocommission, the unexpected opposition of 
France at the bilateral consultations with Russia on the 
delivery of enriched uranium to the European market might block 
the signing of the agreement on Russo-EU partnership and 
cooperation. 
  Previously, the EU delegation demanded that the imports of 
unenriched uranium from Russia should be kept back, which 
hindered the talks. But at the last week's meeting in Paris the 
French delegation stated that the deliveries of Russian 
unenriched uranium were not the problem. Instead, France 
suggested, Russia's quotas for the delivery of enriched uranium 
should be halved. 
  A diplomat working with the Eurocommission said that if 
Russia accepted this proposal, this would create panic among the 
users of Russian uranium in Germany, Britain, Belgium and some 
other EU countries, which opted for priority development of 
nuclear engineering. The protectionist attitude of France put 
in question the signing of a multilateral agreement with the 
European Energy Charter, already signed by Russia, France and 
the EU.
