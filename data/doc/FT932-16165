FT  07 APR 93 / Letter: The tough nuts to crack
Sir, Christopher Lorenz's article (Management, April 2), alluded to
organisational re-engineering as a 'cure-all' for business performance. That
is patently not within the realities of executive life.
The consultancy sales pressure on the re-engineering/ design topic is real,
but the sales pitch and follow-up proposal are often the best bits. Delivery
of measurable business benefits is often illusory.
The nut to be cracked is not comprehending the latest consultancy fashion;
it is establishing the right measures in business so as to produce
bottom-line improvements. One measure is to cut jobs; but this is often a
reaction to problems with the most important measure of all - income
generation. Consulting firms take that aspect very seriously in their own
businesses.
