FT  31 MAR 93 / Letter: Terminals, tunnels and high-speed trains (2)
Sir, With regard to the announcement of the Channel Tunnel rail link, nobody
to my knowledge has yet advanced a commercial rationale for joining two
loss-making and, in some ways, incompatible rail systems with a very
expensive tunnel.
UK taxpayers should ponder the equity of a Pounds 2bn-Pounds 3bn subsidy
(for 'investment' without return that is) on a form of transport which will
partly be funded by tax paid by private-sector coach, bus, freight, taxi,
airline and ferry operators. These providers will, in turn, face enhanced
competition from a rail service which alone among transport forms cannot
operate without state subsidy.
