SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
Two Los Angeles County men have been indicted on cocaine trafficking charges 
that involved a sale that was mostly drywall plaster. 
The defendants, Nestor Martinez, 37, of Downey and Arcesio Escobar-Benitez, 32, 
of Sherman Oaks, have pleaded not guilty and were ordered held without bail in 
the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown San Diego. 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Amalia Meza said Thursday that the defendants were 
arrested Jan. 9 after showing an undercover U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration agent several suitcases purportedly containing 330 pounds of 
cocaine. 
Meza said an analysis of the material showed it contained 13 pounds of the drug 
and mostly drywall plaster for the rest.
