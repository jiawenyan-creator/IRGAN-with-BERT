FT  02 SEP 94 / BA crew vote for strike action
British Airways cabin crew in Manchester and Birmingham have voted to strike
in a dispute over holidays and allowances.

returned their papers in the ballot. Of those, 88 per cent backed strike
action. Meetings are to be held early next week to try to resolve the
dispute.
