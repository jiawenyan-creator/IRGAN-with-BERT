FT  10 JUN 93 / New men brought into Venezuelan cabinet
VENEZUELA'S new president, Mr Ramon J Velasquez, made his first important
cabinet changes yesterday, replacing the ministers of finance, agriculture
and the interior.
Mr Velasquez, who began an eight-month interim presidential term on June 5,
appointed Mr Carlos Rafael Silva to head the finance ministry; Mr Carlos
Delgado Chapellin to be minister of the interior; and Mr Hiram Gaviria as
minister of agriculture.
He also named one of the country's most respected attorneys, Mr Allen Brewer
Carias, to the newly created post of state minister for government
decentralisation. So far, Mr Alirio Parra has kept the job of energy
minister.
Mr Silva, who has been central bank president and minister of education,
said he did not expect the transition government to make any 'radical
changes' in economic policy but rather to maintain 'certain rules of the
game to assure investors and businessmen'.
