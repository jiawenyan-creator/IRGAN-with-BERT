FT  30 MAR 93 / Rally calls for industrial action over coal report
MORE than 2,000 miners and their supporters, including nuclear power
workers, rallied in central London yesterday to protest at the Coal White
Paper, followed by a lobby of parliament, writes Lisa Wood.
Mr Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat MP, joined forces with Mr Arthur
Scargill, the NUM leader, to call on workers throughout the country to take
industrial action to halt the pit closures.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's employment spokesman and Mr Norman Willis, general
secretary of the TUC, were both booed by sections of the crowd - who called
upon the Labour party and the TUC to play a more prominent leadership role
in the dispute.
