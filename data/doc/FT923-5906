FT  27 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
COPPER remained under pressure from liquidation orders on the LME for most
of the day, ignoring late news that Polish miners were threatening to resume
their strike, which took the steam out of early falls on Comex. By the end
of the LME kerb three-month copper was trading at Pounds 1,286.50 a tonne,
down Pounds 11 from Tuesday and equivalent to Dollars 2,508, down Dollars
27. This means that so far this week it has lost a large part of last week's
Dollars 90 gain. ZINC remained underpinned by developing fourth quarter
tightness and news that Peru's Centromin workers have threatened to strike
indefinitely in September. The threat of a fourth quarter squeeze on LME
zinc supplies by a group of traders and producers through strategic
purchases of futures and options prompted further short covering and widened
the backwardation from October. Late news that the European Zinc Institute
had estimated world stocks down 11,330 tonnes in July saw three-month metal
close on the kerb at Dollars 1,364.50 a tonne, up Dollars 13. TIN came in
for a late bout of profit taking. But traders said they were still looking
for a move up to Dollars 7,000 for three-month metal as the recent rally is
still intact.
