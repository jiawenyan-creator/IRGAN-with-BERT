FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (34): Global giants braced for restructuring -
Emiko Terazono discusses the effect of one of the most severe economic
downturns in post-war history on the performance of leading Japanese groups
/ Japan
The FT's list of top Japanese companies by market capitalisation reflects a
period of sagging share prices as a result of one of the most severe
economic downturns in post-war history.
Nevertheless, even with the Nikkei average off 48 per cent from its peak in
1989, companies topping the Japan 100 list are among the largest in the
world by market capitalisation. The relatively large market capitalisation
of Japanese companies is the result of share prices being swollen by
strategic cross shareholding among the country's companies and banks.
Aggressive fund-raising on the stock markets during the late 1980s
accelerated companies' moves towards stable shareholding, resulting in fewer
floating shares in the market. At the end of 1992, 73.1 per cent of the
Tokyo stock market was held by financial and non-financial corporations.
The traditional custom of placing funds into stock and stock assets prompted
investors to pump extra cash into the Tokyo market in the 1980s, pushing
prices higher. Meanwhile, the absence of a merger and acquisition market
deprived investors of a chance to test share prices and valuations, leaving
share prices distorted.
Mr Alex Kinmont, strategist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, believes that if the
cross shareholding structure and fund-raising patterns were adjusted to
match western standards, the market capitalisation of companies would fall
by half from the present levels.
Another aspect of Japanese companies is the low return on capital employed.
The figures reflect low awareness of capital cost among Japanese companies,
which have traditionally relied on banks for funding. Rather than a place to
raise capital, for many of the blue chips companies the equity market has
been regarded as a place to acquire status within the business community.
Many companies have invested funds raised through equity-linked financing
during the late 1980s into companies within the keiretsu (corporate grouping
structures) and the industry. Considering the low dividends of Japanese
companies the returns on such investments have been insignificant.
The vast market capitalisation of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT),
which ranks first, is justified by its large scale of assets and businesses,
which could be spun off as separate companies in the future.
However, its shares are held by financial and industrial companies,
especially of those electronic and telecommunication equipment corporations
which comprise the 'NTT family'.
NTT, which became a private company in 1986, is suffering the effects of
greater competition, and profits last year fell 44 per cent to Y205.8bn. The
company is seeking to cut about 10,000 employees from its payroll through
voluntary retirement by the end of next year.
The deteriorating business outlook is depressing NTT's share price, hence
eroding unrealised profits of companies which hold its stock.
The leading commercial banks, which follow NTT on the rankings list, are at
the core of the keiretsu, or corporate groupings tied together by cross
shareholdings. They also buy stocks of companies they lend to, and vice
versa, hence, are at the centre of a complicated web of cross shareholdings.
For the banks, holding a company's stock was a way to maintain relationships
with companies and, at the same time, wield influence over corporate
decisions. For the companies, such shareholdings acted as a form of
insurance that the banks would stand behind them in times of financial
difficulty.
However, due to mounting bad loans stemming from the reckless lending of the
late 1980s, the banks are finding it more difficult to maintain such ties.
Problem loans rose 9.6 per cent during the first half of the business year
to September, and the banks are realising profits on long-term stock
holdings to cover the losses from writing off such loans. Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank, for example, took profits of Y52.2bn during the period.
The banks may see lower market capitalisation in the future as they are
forced to unravel more of their cross shareholdings as a fall in fund demand
from companies depresses profits, while at the same time, the weak stock
market erodes its unrealised stock-holding gains.
Toyota Motor, ranked seventh, is a company supported by a typical industrial
keiretsu and cross-shareholding relationship which includes component
suppliers, specialised manufacturers, and distributors.
Almost all large manufacturers, such as Nissan, Hitachi, and Matsushita
Electric Industrial, have their own keiretsu. However, such relationships
are also slowly loosening as companies are forced to supplement their
falling profits with gains on shareholdings.
The large manufacturers are also reviewing existing relationships with their
group suppliers, telling them to reduce their reliance on the company at the
core of the grouping.
The downturn in the economy is accelerating the rise in awareness about the
cost of capital. Some companies already recognise the importance of
profitability, especially new industries which are not bound by old ties.
Nintendo, the video game maker, ranked 49th, has a 26.5 per cent return on
capital employed, while Seven-Eleven Japan, the convenience store chain,
ranked 18th, has a return on capital of 18.5 per cent.
As corporate profits and share prices remain in the doldrums, more companies
will be forced to unwind cross shareholdings. Although the
cross-shareholding structure of the traditional type keiretsu such as the
Mitsubishi and the Mitsui groups, will take time to disappear, relationships
between companies on the fringe of such groupings are likely to diminish.
In the long run, companies will be forced to use capital more efficiently,
and although it may not happen immediately, market capitalisation of the
Tokyo stock market will decline as companies will value profits over
relationships.
In addition, with the present restructuring of companies, which is likely to
lead to a review of traditional practices, such as life-time employment, and
with shareholders eventually gaining more strength due to legal changes in
the commercial code, return on capital employed is likely to increase
gradually.
