FT  05 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa turns back from highs
A bullish start was made to Johannesburg trading as the market assessed the
ratings assigned to the country's foreign currency long term debt. But the
early promise was not fulfilled as a firmer financial rand and softer gold
price dragged shares off highs to end mostly down on the day.
Dealers said investors were generally encouraged by the investment grade
BAA3 rating assigned by Moody's but they had reservations about the
speculative BB rating assigned by Standard &amp; Poor's.
Key industrials attracted steady interest amid a limited supply of scrip
before succumbing to financial rand strength.
The overall index lost a net 18 at 5,654, industrials 4 at 6,301 and golds
24 at 2,400.
Anglos fell R2 to R238, JCI was off R1 at R105 and Vaal Reefs declined R5 to
R472.
SAB reversed an earlier gain to close 50 cents softer at R84 but Barlows
remained in demand, adding 65 cents at R31, and Sappi rose R2 to R58.
