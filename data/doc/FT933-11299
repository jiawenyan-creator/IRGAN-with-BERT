FT  30 JUL 93 / Lib Dems launch into party time after 'stunning win'
THE Liberal Democrats in Christchurch launched into celebrations this
morning as they triumphantly declared themselves stunned by the size of
their by-election victory. Mr Don Foster, Liberal Democrat MP for Bath,
said: 'To be achieving this against a Tory majority of 23,000 is amazing. It
shows a massive swing.'
It had taken 4 1/2 hours from the close of the polls for election officials
to count the stacks of voting papers in a crowded and stuffy local leisure
centre.
As the evening progressed, the Liberal Democrats could barely conceal their
delight. Even before the declaration they announced that their leader Mr
Paddy Ashdown would be touring the constituency in an open-top bus today.
Meanwhile the Conservatives began to assume expressions of dignified
resignation as it became clear that their candidate Mr Rob Hayward had not
held the seat.
Supporters of Labour candidate Mr Nigel Lickley were notable only by their
low profile, less visible than the groups of wacky candidates such as Lord
David Sutch or the candidate dressed in a giant chicken outfit for the
Alfred Chicken party.
After the declaration, amid rousing Liberal Democrat cheers, Ms Tara Bardot
Jackson from the Buy the Daily Sport party, dressed in an exotic rubber and
Lycra outfit, was the first of the 14 candidates to cross the stage and
congratulate the quietly triumphant Mrs Maddock.
Although the Tories had been braced for defeat the size of the swing left
many feeling stunned. Most Conservative workers cited the issue of VAT on
heating fuel as the chief cause of their defeat, although others privately
indicated that Mr Hayward was likely to become, at least partly, a
scapegoat. One local party worker said: 'He hasn't been very good at putting
himself across.'
Mr Peter Herbage, a Christchurch Conservative councillor, said: 'There's a
lot of us who feel that, if he lost in Bristol, why did they send him here?'
