FT  31 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow starts new week mildly
firmer
Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended slightly firmer after moderate trading yesterday,
aided by stronger overseas markets and further declines in domestic bond
yields, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.36 at 3,643.99. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.36 higher at 461.90, while
the American SE composite gained 1.28 at 456.27 and the Nasdaq composite
added 3.31 at 737.38. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 194m
shares.
At the end of last week, profit-taking brought leading indices a few points
down from their record highs, so analysts were expecting this week to start
on an upbeat note. Those expectations were met, partly due to gains in
Japanese, German and French equity markets, and to fresh strength in the US
bond market.
In recent months lower bond yields have been the main driving force behind
the equity markets' record-breaking run, and yesterday the benchmark 30-year
government bond edged higher once again, lowering the yield on the issue to
6.115 per cent, near its historic low.
The day's only major economic news - the 5.0 per cent drop in July new home
sales - had no apparent impact upon investor sentiment. Investors will get a
much better picture of the state of the economy later this week when a raft
of key data, including second-quarter real gross domestic product and the
August employment report, is released.
Technology issues were in demand, with Motorola firming Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 96 1/2 , IBM adding Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 44 5/8 , Digital
Equipment rising Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 41 1/2 and Compaq, which launched
new models on one of its range of personal computers and lowered prices on
others, gaining Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 52 3/4 .
Chubb fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 88 1/4 as investors responded to news
that the big insurance company will be taking an after-tax charge of Dollars
358m, or Dollars 3.95 a share, in the third quarter to cover an agreement
that one of its units has struck to settle certain asbestos-related
insurance claims.
Profit-taking took the shine off car manufacturing issues, which were among
the market leaders last week. Chrysler eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 43 1/4
, Ford shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 51 1/4 and General Motors dipped Dollars
 3/8 to Dollars 47.
On the Nasdaq market, Lotus Development moved ahead Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars
33 1/2 in volume of 3.5m shares after broking house Donaldson Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette upgraded its rating on the stock to 'buy' from 'moderately
attractive', citing the strength and breadth of the company's products.
Other technology stocks were also firmer, with Microsoft up Dollars 3/4 at
Dollars 72 5/8 , Intel Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 64 and Sun
Microsystems Dollars  5/8 ahead at Dollars 25 7/8 .
Canada
TORONTO posted a small rise in relatively light trading. The TSE 300 index
finished 5.4 higher at another record closing peak of 4,138.8 as advances
led declines by 382 to 330 after volume of 45.6m shares.
The gold shares index added 1.44 per cent as the New York bullion price
gained USDollars 1 an ounce. Minings also registered a solid gain.
