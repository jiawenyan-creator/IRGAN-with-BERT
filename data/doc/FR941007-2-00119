 

The Amex believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives
of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in
facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market and a national market system.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Amex does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others



No written comments were either solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The Amex has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
of the Act.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, regarding the proposed amendments to Section
107A of the Guide, the Commission believes that the proposal will provide the Amex with added flexibility to list and
trade hybrid securities, which may benefit investors by providing additional investment and hedging opportunities,
as well as benefitting issuers who offer hybrid securities as a means of raising capital. Additionally, the proposed
changes to Section 107A of the Guide will conform Amex's rules regarding the listing of hybrid securities to those
already approved for the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). The NYSE's hybrid listing rules do not contain
a minimum holder requirement for hybrid issues traded in thousand dollar denominations on the Exchange's bond floor.
Additionally, Section 703.19 of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual provides that an issue of a hybrid security must
have a minimum market value at issuance of $4 million.

The Commission also believes that the proposed amendments to Section 107B of the Guide are consistent with the Act.
Specifically, the proposal to amend 107B provide that ELNs may be linked to non-convertible preferred stock, in addition
to common stock, will conform Amex's rules to those approved by the Commission for the listing and trading of Equity-Linked
Debt Securities (``ELDS'') on the NYSE.

With respect to the remaining amendments to Section 107B, the Commission believes that the proposed changes do not
raise any significant regulatory issues that were not addressed in the Commission's prior approval orders regarding
ELNs.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission finds that the proposal to add an additional market capitalization and trading volume requirement
for eligible linked securities will expand the number of securities that can be linked to ELNs while maintaining the
requirement that the linked security be an actively traded common stock or sponsored ADR issued by a highly capitalized
issuer. While the proposal introduces a third alternative for ELN eligibility that reduces the minimum market capitalization
requirement for the linked security, the stock of such an issuer (or sponsored ADR related thereto) could only be linked
to an ELN issue if its trading volume in the U.S. for the prior one-year period is at least 80 million shares, which is
four times higher than the current minimum trading volume requirement.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes that together, the new capitalization and trading volume requirements will continue to
ensure that ELNs are only issued on highly liquid securities of broadly capitalized companies and that these requirements
will reduce the likelihood of any adverse market impact on the securities underlying ELNs.
