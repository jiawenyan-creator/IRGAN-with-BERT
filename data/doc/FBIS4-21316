  [Text] A joint force from the Lebanese Army and the 
Internal Security Forces have seized approximately 30 tons of 
hashish in al-Bustan village in al-Hirmil and 20 kg of hashish 
in Mazra'at Abu-Salibah near Dayr al-Ahmar. The operation 
followed a tip that large quantities of hashish had been 
processed and stored in various places in the two villages. 
Seven presses and other devises used for processing hashish, 
heavy, medium, and light-caliber weapons, explosives, and 
military binoculars have also been seized. Twenty-four persons 
have been arrested. 
  A statement by the Internal Security Forces stressed that 
the 
operation shows that no area is beyond the control of the 
legitimate authority and that it has come as part of its 
decision to strike at drug traffickers and ban the cultivation 
of drugs. The operation has come in response to the attacks 
against the Internal Security Forces in Qabb Ilyas, the 
statement added.
