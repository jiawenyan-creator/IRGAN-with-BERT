 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the Colorado Ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the Governor
on September 27, 1989, and August 30, 1990. The revisions consist of amendments to Regulation No. 7, ``Regulation
To Control Emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds.'' In its review of the September 27, 1989 State submittal, EPA
identified several areas where the regulation still did not meet EPA requirements. On August 30, 1990, the State submitted
additional revisions to Regulation No. 7 to address these deficiencies. This 

Federal Register

 action applies to both of these submittals. The amendments were made to conform Regulation No. 7 to federal requirements,
and to improve the clarity and enforceability of the regulation. EPA's approval will serve to make the revisions federally
enforceable and was requested by the State of Colorado. 


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Comments must be received on or before December 16, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 110(a)(2)(H)(i) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended in 1990, provides the State the opportunity to amend
its SIP from time to time as may be necessary. The State is utilizing this authority of the CAA to update and revise existing
regulations which are a part of the SIP. 


I. Background 


On March 3, 1978, EPA designated the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area as nonattainment for the National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone (43 FR 8976). This designation was reaffirmed by EPA on November 6, 1991 (56
FR 56694) pursuant to section 107(d)(1) of the CAA, as amended in 1990. Furthermore, since the Denver-Boulder area
had not shown a violation of the ozone standard during the three-year period from January 1, 1987 to December 31, 1989,
the Denver-Boulder area was classified as a ``transitional'' ozone nonattainment area under section 185A of the
amended Act. In order to meet the Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirements of the CAA, transitional
areas must correct any RACT deficiencies regarding enforceability. 
The current Colorado Ozone SIP was approved by EPA in the 

Federal Register

 on December 12, 1983 (48 FR 55284). The SIP contains Regulation No. 7 (Reg 7), which applies RACT to stationary sources
of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). Reg 7 was adopted to meet the requirements of Section 172(b)(2) and (3) of the
1977 CAA (concerning the application of RACT to stationary sources.

) However, the approved Ozone SIP did not rely on the emissions reduction credit that Reg 7 would produce in order to
demonstrate attainment; rather, the SIP relied only on mobile source controls in order to demonstrate attainment.

</FOOTNAME>
The requirement to apply RACT to existing stationary sources of VOC emissions was carried forth under the amended
Act in section 172(c)(1). 
</FOOTNOTE>


During 1987 and 1988, EPA Region VIII conducted a review of Reg 7 for consistency with the Control Techniques Guidelines
documents (CTGs) and regulatory guidance, for enforceability and for clarity. The CTGs, which are guidance documents
issued by EPA, set forth measures that are presumptively RACT for specific categories of sources that emit VOCs. A
substantial number of deficiencies were identified in Reg 7. In 1987, EPA published a proposed policy document that
included, among other things, an interpretation of the RACT requirements as they applied to VOC nonattainment areas
(52 FR 45044, November 24, 1987, Post-87 Policy). On May 25, 1988, EPA published a guidance document entitled ``Issues
Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of the November
24, 1987 

Federal Register

 Notice'' (the ``Blue Book''). A review of Reg 7 against these documents uncovered additional deficiencies in the
regulation. 
On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of Colorado that the Carbon Monoxide (CO) SIPs for Colorado Springs and Fort
Collins were inadequate to achieve the CO NAAQS. In that letter, EPA also notified the Governor that the Ozone SIP had
significant deficiencies in design and implementation, and requested that these deficiencies be remedied. EPA
did not make a formal call for a revised Ozone SIP in the May 1988 letter,

2

 even though the Denver-Boulder area was, and continues to be, designated nonattainment for ozone. The reason for
this decision was that no violations of the ozone NAAQS had been recorded in the nonattainment area for the previous
three years. However, EPA indicated that the deficiencies, if uncorrected, could jeopardize the area's ability
to obtain eventual redesignation as an attainment area for ozone.

</FOOTNAME>
Under the pre-amended Act, EPA had the authority under section 110(a)(2)(H) to issue a ``SIP Call'' requiring a State
to correct deficiencies in an existing SIP. Section 110(a)(2)(H) was not modified by the 1990 Amendments. In addition,
the amended Act contains new section 110(k)(5) which also provides authority for a SIP Call.

1. 1989 SIP Revision Submittal


In a letter dated September 27, 1989, the Governor of Colorado submitted revisions to Reg 7 to partially address EPA's
concerns with the Ozone SIP. A detailed description of the specific revisions to the regulation is contained in the
Docket for this 

Federal Register

 document. Revisions were made to the following sections of Reg 7:
