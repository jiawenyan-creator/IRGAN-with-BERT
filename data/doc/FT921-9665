FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Slight decline at Yves St
Laurent
YVES Saint Laurent, the French fashion house which last week celebrated its
30th anniversary, yesterday confirmed it had sustained a slight fall in net
profits for 1991, on sales which rose 2 per cent to FFr3.06bn (Dollars
576.2m), from FFr3bn in 1990, writes Alice Rawsthorn.
Saint Laurent said profits for 1991 would fall slightly from the FFr252m
made in 1990, given the competitive state of the luxury goods market and
also the impact of the costs incurred in launching a skin-care range.
As with the rest of the global luxury goods industry, Saint Laurent
experienced a difficult year in 1991.
