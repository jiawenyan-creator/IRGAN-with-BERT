CHARGES AGAINST BOTHA ARE QUITE BEASTLY 
An opposition member of Parliament has called on President Pieter W. Botha to 
resign over alleged illegal use of a police vehicle to transport dead antelope 
after a hunt. 
Fanie Jacobs, told a news conference Monday that the carcasses of eight bucks, 
a cow and two wildebeest, all clearly labeled "State President P.W. Botha," 
were found during a routine check on a truck at a roadblock last week. 
Jacobs, from the ultra-rightist Conservative Party, said the truck was a police 
vehicle with false plates and that its insignia was deliberately concealed. The 
driver did not have the written authorization required to transport dead meat, 
he added. 
A spokesman for the president's office confirmed that Botha was on a hunt at a 
game farm last week but denied any wrongdoing in transporting the kill.
