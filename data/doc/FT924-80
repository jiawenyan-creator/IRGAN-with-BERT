FT  31 DEC 92 / Life insurers win delay on tax plan
MR STEPHEN DORRELL, the financial secretary to the Treasury, yesterday
announced a year's postponement in levying a new tax charge on life
insurance companies' unit trust holdings.
The decision follows long discussions with the Association of British
Insurers and is likely to be welcomed by life insurers and unit trust
companies.
Mr Dorrell said the delay was introduced because the measure, announced in
the Budget of March 1990 and due to be introduced for companies from
accounting periods beginning last January, could 'produce a higher tax
charge than was intended'. It will now be introduced for accounting years
beginning from tomorrow.
Authorised unit trusts and certain offshore funds do not have to pay capital
gains tax on transactions within the fund. The tax is only payable when the
trust itself is sold.
The funds of many life companies used large holdings in unit trusts as a
method of rolling over or deferring capital gains tax. This gave life funds
a more favourable tax position than the government wanted. The government's
original proposal had been to tax life companies on the assumption that
their holdings of unit trusts were sold and immediately repurchased at
market value at the end of each accounting period.
According to the insurers the tax charge could have led to an uneven tax
burden on unit-linked insurance policies which invested solely in unit
trusts, and those which invested in a life company's own unit-linked fund.
They were also anxious that this could lead to sudden heavy disposals of
unit trusts, with a distorting effect on the market. There were also a
number of technical difficulties.
Legislation will be introduced as part of the 1993 Finance Bill to
counteract the distortion, and to introduce transitional arrangements.
