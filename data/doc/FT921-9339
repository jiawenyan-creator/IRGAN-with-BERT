FT  12 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: GPA
Those GPA executives naturally itching to join the millionaires' club would
be advised to wait. The public row between the aircraft leasing company and
its advisers could always be part of a well rehearsed plot. On the
assumption that it is not, investors are now likely to be suspicious of any
flotation price much above Dollars 22 a share.
There are other good reasons for letting the dust settle. Yesterday's news
that net profits jumped 25 per cent in the third quarter is certainly a sign
that earnings may be on a new growth path. But what is most striking is the
fact that 73 per cent of the total came from securitised aircraft sales,
with only 25 per cent from conventional leasing.
Admittedly, GPA's proven placing power is central to the success of both
activities, and the two divisions are well integrated. But the market will
be more impressed by firm evidence that the more reliable stream of leasing
income is recovering, and if GPA holds its fire until after the final
results in the summer, there is always a chance that there will be signs of
recovery in the world economy.
