FT  13 MAY 91 / US Money and Credit: Delayed reaction to poor refunding
THE CURIOUS performance of the US bond markets on Friday afternoon was a
little like that of a tightrope walker who successfully crosses the high
wire, but then slips and falls at the far end from pent-up fright.
And the main reason for the market's sudden fall - the poor reception for
the US Treasury's quarterly refunding - could continue to reverberate for
quite a time yet.
Four-fifths of the way through last week the credit markets were breathing a
collective sigh of relief. The Treasury's record Dollars 37bn refunding on
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday was hardly a runaway hit, but at least it
had not spooked the bond market.
Calm seemed to prevail, despite the fact that Thursday's auction of 30-year
bonds attracted the smallest amount of bids since these securities were
first offered to the market on a regular basis in the 1970s. There was only
Dollars 1.41 in bids for every dollar of the Dollars 11.75bn on offer.
And, while the average yield on the bonds sold was 8.21 per cent, in line
with the market's expectations, there was a particularly large 'tail' - the
difference between the average and highest bid  - of three basis points.
That indicated dealers had widely different views of the value of the paper.
Why did this news not send prices plunging immediately?
One reason was that the market was anticipating good figures on inflation on
Friday, which it duly got: the producer price index rose only 0.2 per cent
in April, in line with expectations, in a further demonstration that the
recession is putting the squeeze on inflation - though the bond market is
reluctant to accept this.
When this good news failed to attract fresh buying, however, the initial
relief that the Treasury refunding was over turned to concern over the poor
reception received by the long bond, and prices began to tumble as dealers
tried to cut their inventory ahead of the weekend.
The fall was intensified by a rumour that Californian insurance regulators,
who on Friday clamped strong controls on a troubled insurer, First Capital
Life, were also demanding that it liquidate its junk and investment grade
bond portfolios. The upshot was that the new benchmark long bond closed the
week at 97 7/8 , compared with 99 1/16 in the auction, while the yield rose
from 8.21 to 8.31.
Both factors underline the market's concern about an oversupply of paper,
and this source of anxiety is not about to go away. The Federal government
is anticipating borrowing needs of some Dollars 115bn in the third quarter,
and estimates of its requirements from now to the end of September range as
high as Dollars 155bn. That could cause a lot of indigestion.
However the position may not be quite as bleak as it first appears. Ms
Kathleen Stephansen of securities firm Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette points
out that some Dollars 70bn of this may be earmarked to support the
Resolution Trust, which is cleaning up the savings and loans mess, and the
trust may not be able to use that amount in so short a time. Furthermore,
money borrowed for the thrift bail-out does not increase overall demand for
credit and does not stimulate aggregate demand.
Even so, the government's funding requirements could prove even bigger than
now forecast if the economy does not start soon showing signs of an upturn,
which would boost its tax receipts.
The recent spate of economic indicators has been thoroughly confusing. The
optimists - and they include most Wall Street analysts  - insist this is yet
another sign that the US is approaching an economic turning point, as the
downward movement of the last 10 months reaches the bottom of the trough.
However, as yet there have been few signs of an upturn in industry's order
books. The key automotive sector remains flat on its back, and there is some
fear the consumer-led downturn may now be followed by a sizeable drop in
business expenditure.
Another potentially worrying sign is the slow growth in money supply that
re-appeared in April, although this could have been a seasonal freak.
There will be more clues on Monday and Tuesday, with the release of data on
industrial production, retail sales and consumer price inflation in April.
And the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Markets Committee will have
these on hand on Tuesday when it meets to consider monetary policy.
Unless the newly released figures - or the Fed's own preliminary money
supply growth statistics for early May - are dreadful, the central bank
seems unlikely to change its policy, which took the Fed funds rate down to 5
3/4 per cent at the end of April.
