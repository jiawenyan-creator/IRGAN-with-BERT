FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Canon cuts its profit forecast
as yen rises
CANON, the Japanese manufacturer of cameras and office equipment, warned
that profits for the current year were expected to be less than half its
earlier forecast.
The company blamed the appreciation of the yen, which has risen 11 per cent
this year and hit export revenues. Exports account for nearly 80 per cent of
the group's sales.
Canon revised its parent company pre-tax profits forecast for the year to
December 1993 to Y38bn (Dollars 345m), from the Y77.5bn it expected in
February. Sales have also been revised down, from Y1,100bn to Y1,060bn.
On a consolidated basis, Canon expects sales for the year to fall 3.5 per
cent from its previous forecast of Y1,980bn to Y1,910bn.
Pre-tax profits are revised down 37 per cent from Y102bn to Y64bn.
The rise in the yen's value - from about Y125 to Y110 to the dollar - had
reduced the company's expected revenues from exports by Y82bn, Canon said.
It plans to deal with the impact of the yen's appreciation through price
increases, cost-cutting and by transferring a larger proportion of its
manufacturing to its overseas bases, although it does not intend to increase
manufacturing sites outside of Japan.
