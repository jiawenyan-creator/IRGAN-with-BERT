RITES SCHEDULED FOR WRITER RUSSELL 
A memorial service will be held at 3 p.m. Wednesday for Hortense Lion Russell, 
a novelist and magazine writer, who died last Thursday of natural causes at 
Chateau La Jolla, a retirement home. She was 92. 
In 1963, Russell moved from New York City to San Diego. Four years later she 
moved to La Jolla. 
Russell wrote articles for Redbook and Cosmopolitan magazines, short stories 
and three novels: "Mill Stream," "Second Love" and "The Grass Grows Green," 
which was on the New York Times best seller list in 1942. 
As a member of the Institute of Continued Learning at UC San Diego, she often 
lectured on short stories. "She was a real optimist. She always said no matter 
how dark things were, they would always work out," said her son, Richard 
Russell. "Since she lived through two world wars and the Great Depression, she 
knew what she was talking about." 
Russell is survived by her son, Richard of La Jolla; a daughter, Kate Bobker of 
New Rochelle, N.Y.; eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. 
Wednesday's service will be at Richard Russell's home in La Jolla. Anyone 
wishing to attend may call 454-0481.
