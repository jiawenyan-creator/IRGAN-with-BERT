FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Clinical Computing flotation to raise
Pounds 3m
Clinical Computing, the medical software group, yesterday announced a
flotation price of 124p to raise Pounds 3.1m net from a placing of 4.05m
shares.
Mr Michael Gordon, executive chairman, said the funds raised would be used
to accelerate the development of its Proton software package, used mainly as
a medical information database in the UK and the US.
'The flotation will increase the company's ability to raise additional
capital to finance future growth,' he added.
The group, which develops computer information systems for clinical use,
said institutions had already taken up all the shares on offer, representing
25 per cent of the enlarged capital.
Of those shares, 2.85m have been issued by the company while Mr Gordon has
agreed to sell 960,000 shares and Mr Conrad Venn, technical director,
240,000.
Following the flotation, handled by brokers Keith Bayley Rogers, existing
directors will retain more than 66 per cent of the enlarged share capital,
with 32.5 per cent being held by Mr Gordon.
The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, showed the company made a
Pounds 1.16m pre-tax profit on turnover of Pounds 2.6m in the 1993 year.
This compared with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 549,000 on turnover of Pounds 2m
in the previous 17 month period.
Mr Jeremy Woan, chief executive, said the 1992 deficit was due almost
entirely to 'non-recurring directors' emoluments' of Pounds 737,816.
Since then, he added, the directors involved, Mr Gordon and Mr Venn, had
agreed to employment contracts on annual salaries of Pounds 85,000 and
Pounds 75,000 respectively. Mr Woan will also receive Pounds 75,000.
In the current financial year, the estimated aggregate remuneration and
benefits in kind payable to directors is expected to be about Pounds
340,000.
Trading is expected to begin on February 17.
