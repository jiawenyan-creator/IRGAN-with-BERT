  [Text] Commenting on the possibility of providing special 
protection to U.S. citizens, Government Minister Danilo 
Parrinello said yesterday that the "state is obligated to 
provide security for all Guatemalans, foreign residents, and 
tourists, but we cannot provide special security for foreigners 
of a specific nationality." 
  The minister commented on several incidents, including the 
recent kidnapping of the daughter of a U.S. couple, and said "it 
could all be part of an attempt to create divisions between the 
Guatemalan Government and the United States." Nevertheless, 
Parrinello did not rule out the possibility that it could all be 
"a coincidence." 
  The government minister indicated that he is willing to try 
to provide security for everyone who needs its, but he insisted 
that "the state's role is to ensure the safety, life, and 
property of all citizens as well as of the foreigners living 
here. Foreigners and Guatemalans are entitled to the same 
rights." 
  Referring to President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's statements 
regarding a prohibition on weapons sales, Parrinello said that 
he was referring directly to what the U.S. State Department 
stipulates with respect to U.S. manufacturers' sales to 
Guatemala for security forces purposes. 
  Parrinello said that the U.S. measure "is unfair because 
from 
1944 to date, there has never been an administration more 
respectful of individual rights, nor has there been one that has 
given a more prominent position to human rights issues than that 
of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio." 
  Parrinello stressed that the United States must reevaluate 
its political decision. In the meantime, we will continue 
turning to other friendly countries to procure nonlethal 
materials already manufactured in Guatemala "or to import them 
from friendly countries which understand that our government 
does respect individual rights." 
  Commenting on the [Jorge] Carpio murder case, Parrinello 
said: "I do not have any documents that must be turned over to 
the legal system, and if I did, I would hand them over 
immediately." 
  The minister urged the Guatemalan Bishops Conference to 
reveal the names of the responsible parties, as they say they 
have, and emphasized the president's intention to establish the 
Carpio Commission, for which the president has already issued 
precise instructions to the General Secretariat.
