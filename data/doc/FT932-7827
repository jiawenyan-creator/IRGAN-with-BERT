FT  21 MAY 93 / Observer: Chemistry lesson
Sounds as if the 38,000 members of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great
Britain do not have quite as high an opinion of Allen Lloyd, chairman of the
fast-expanding Lloyds Chemists, as does the stock market.
Lloyd, the Pounds 348,000 a year boss of Britain's second biggest chemist
chain, has failed in his first attempt to get elected to the council of the
152-year-old society. Lloyd, not normally lost for words, refuses to say
whether he will risk being snubbed a second time. Pity, since now that he
has split the role of chairman and chief executive he should have more time
on his hands.
