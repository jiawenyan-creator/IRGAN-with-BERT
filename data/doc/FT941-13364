FT  26 JAN 94 / BAe cuts 400 more Ordnance jobs
Cuts in the British Aerospace group continued with the announcement
yesterday of more than 400 additional job losses at its Royal Ordnance
munitions and guns division.
The reduction at Royal Ordnance's Chorley factory in Lancashire brings the
total of BAe job cuts announced in the past two weeks to about 1,760.
The latest measure brought sharp condemnation from unions and the Labour
party.
