FT  02 MAY 92 / Markets (At a glance): Halifax account change
Halifax is replacing its fixed interest Monthly Income Xtra account on
Tuesday with a new account called Guaranteed Reserve. The new account
differs from Monthly Income Xtra by giving gently tiered rates of interest
and a choice of fixed terms, ranging from six months to five years. Like the
old account, the minimum deposit is Pounds 2,000. The one-year fixed rate on
Pounds 2,000 is 9.65 per cent gross (7.24 per cent net). Income is payable
monthly or annually, or on maturity.
