FT  31 OCT 92 / L30,000bn to defend lira
DEFENCE of the lira during the currency markets' turbulence of September
cost the Bank of Italy L30,000bn (Pounds 13.8bn) in reserves, the bank
revealed yesterday.
It also showed for the first time the full extent of its short-term
obligations contracted with the Bundesbank and the Belgian central bank to
defend the lira last month. These obligations, principally to the
Bundesbank, amounted to L27,330bn.
This short-term support, due to be repaid on December 16, ensured that
foreign exchange reserves at the end of September were L20,801bn against the
previous month's L22,891bn. Nevertheless between August and September, total
net reserves were halved, falling from L62,670bn to L32,917bn.
The country's net reserves are now at their lowest since 1978 and are less
than one third of the L108,581bn this time last year. The acceleration in
the loss of reserves began in June with the result of the Danish referendum
on Maastricht. However, throughout the crisis the bank has refused to touch
its reserves of gold, now valued at L26,228bn.
