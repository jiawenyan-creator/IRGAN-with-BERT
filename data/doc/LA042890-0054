'REPULSIVE' BUT ARTISTIC? 
I've just read the April 13 review of "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife &amp; Her 
Lover" ("Cook": Grossness From Great Talents") in which Kevin Thomas calls the 
film "repulsive," with scenes of cannibalism and of a man smeared with 
excrement. Quick! Call the National Endowment for the Arts! I'm sure it will 
want to sponsor the sequel in the name of artistic freedom!
