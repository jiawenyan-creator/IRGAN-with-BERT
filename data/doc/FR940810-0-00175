 The impacts of the revision to the asbestos standard on establishments involved in ship repair are expected to be minimal.
Table 13 shows that average price impacts would be 0.07 percent for all establishments and would be 0.1 percent for
small establishments if firms were able to charge increased operating costs to their customers, i.e., ship owners.
At the opposite extreme in terms of potential financial impact, compliance costs as a percentage of profits would
average 0.8 percent for firms of all sizes in ship repair and would average 1.2 percent for small firms in ship repair.
Thus, OSHA has concluded that there will be no significant differential effect on small businesses involved in ship
repair as a result of the final standard.
