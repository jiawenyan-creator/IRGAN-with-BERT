FT  30 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow finds new support in
firmer bonds
Wall Street
A COMBINATION of futures-related program trading, end-of-quarter buying, a
firmer bond market, and broadly positive economic news lifted leading US
stock prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 15.12 up at 3,455.10, although well
below its high for the day of a near-record 3,478. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
finished 2.99 stronger at 450.77, but the American SE composite was 0.16
easier at 419.31 and the Nasdaq composite off 0.78 at 680.76. New York SE
trading volume was relatively light at 200m shares.
The markets opened against a background of mostly positive news. Bond
prices, which had tumbled last week on fears of inflation, pushing up
long-term market interest rates in the process, staged a modest morning
rally. This eased equity investors' fears that bond prices were in a
freefall.
The day's economic statistics were generally supportive of equities. The
Commerce Department announced that new single-family home sales rose 4.6 per
cent in February, and that personal income increased by 0.2 per cent last
month. Although both figures were weaker than market forecasts, the
department also reported a stronger than expected 0.6 per cent rise in
personal consumption for February.
Other factors helping equity prices included some futures-related program
buying, and demand from portfolio managers looking to improve the
performance of their holdings before the end of the first quarter -
so-called 'window dressing'.
Generally, market analysts expect prices to retain a positive bias for most
of the week. Friday will be a pivotal day, however, because of the release
of the closely watched March employment report, which will give an
up-to-date view of how the labour market is responding to the growing
economy.
Among individual stocks, IBM was bought heavily in early trading, rising
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 52 3/4 , before retreating to end Dollars  1/4 up
at Dollars 51 5/8 after volume of 2.0m shares. The buying was seen as a
spillover from last Friday, when the stock rose on confirmation that Mr
Louis Gerstner, former head of RJR Nabisco, had been appointed as IBM's new
chairman.
Airline issues were in demand. Delta, which announced plans to sideline
hundreds of pilots and aircraft, jumped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 54 3/4 .
AMR rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 64 1/2 and UAL added Dollars 2 5/8 at
Dollars 124 7/8 .
News Corp held steady at Dollars 41 1/4 in spite of a downgrade from the
sector analyst at brokerage house Alex Brown, who was responding to the news
that Mr Rupert Murdoch, News Corp's chief executive, had agreed to take over
the loss-making New York Post tabloid newspaper.
Hit by a broker's downgrade was Harley-Davidson, which declined Dollars  5/8
to Dollars 37 3/4 after Salomon Brothers lowered its rating on the
motorcycle manufacturer from 'buy' to 'hold', citing the recent run-up in
the stock's price.
Canada
TORONTO saw active trading. The TSE 300 index was finally down 14.5 at
3,585.2, although winning issues narrowly led losers by 346 to 339. Volume
amounted to 53.7m shares valued at CDollars 438.1m.
