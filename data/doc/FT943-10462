FT  04 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Low in demand
J. Sainsbury's refusal to respond to the much-anticipated increased offer by
Tesco for Scottish retailer William Low led to some investors getting caught
short.
Tesco's new bid of 360p a share, trumping Sainsbury's 305p offer, was
announced before the market opened, and as the session got under way one US
investment house was said to be predicting a rapid Sainsbury response in
excess of 400p a share.
The broker was not alone, and the Low stock price immediately surged from
the opening of 336p, passing the new Tesco offer price, to 368p within
minutes - before halting abruptly as a stunned market heard the news shortly
before 9am that Sainsbury was pulling out of the fray.
The shares eventually ended a hectic session 23 ahead at 359p after record
turnover of 14m. Dealers said that much of the buying had been undertaken by
one of the big US brokers which was aiming to convert into Tesco, which was
offering a share alternative to the cash offer, at a profitable price.
Turnover in Tesco hit 19m as some investors worried over the effect of the
deal on short-term earnings and the shares dipped 5 1/2 to 237 1/2 p.
Sainsbury was steady at 419p.
The speed of Sainsbury's withdrawal prompted some food analysts to question
whether Tesco had come back at too high a price. However, the consensus was
that both companies had emerged from the battle for Low with credibility
intact: Tesco for paying a reasonable if full price, and Sainsbury for not
becoming further embroiled in a damaging bidding war.
