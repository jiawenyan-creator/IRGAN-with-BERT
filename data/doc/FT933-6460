FT  27 AUG 93 / Observer: Out-classed
Three years ago, Observer predicted that the new, thrice-yearly Treasury
Bulletin, the slim azure paperback of austere articles about monetary
targeting and other economic arcana, would soon become a collector's item.
Yesterday, the prediction came true. The Treasury confessed that the latest
volume was the last edition of a publication whose cover price has risen
almost as fast as interest in its contents has dropped. When it comes to
value for money, the Treasury has never been able to match the Bank of
England quarterly bulletin.
For Pounds 7.50 the Treasury offers 65 pages, whereas the Bank provides 120
pages for the same price. A bigger problem, though, was content. Treasury
economists dreaded being told to write for the publication, and their turgid
style soon produced such disappointing circulation figures that even HMSO,
the publisher, became concerned. When circulation dropped below 500,
compared with the quarterly bulletin's 5,500 copies, the Treasury had little
choice but to admit yet another mistake and scrap the venture.
