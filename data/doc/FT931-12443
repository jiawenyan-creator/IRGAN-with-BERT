FT  28 JAN 93 / Tourist chief failed to win allies
WHEN MR WILLIAM Davis went to see Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage
secretary, last Tuesday he hoped to be told that the government wanted him
to remain as chairman of the British Tourist Authority and the English
Tourist Board.
Mr Brooke did not oblige. Mr Davis's three-year term, which ends in March,
is the shortest served by any chairman of either body.
Mr Davis, a publishing millionaire, said he was going because of the
government's lukewarm attitude to tourism, evidenced by its decision to cut
the ETB's grant from Pounds 15.4m this year to Pounds 9.1m by 1995.
One tourist industry insider said: 'I think he was keen to hear that he had
been reappointed. But it has to be said he wasn't very good at being
diplomatic. Even if you are an entrepreneurial type, there have to be ways
to influence civil servants.
'Frankly, he's rubbed people up the wrong way in the industry as well.'
Attacks on the government's tourism policy usually elicit a favourable
response from the industry. Mr Davis's swipe has not, however, met with
universal approval.
While the ETB, which concentrates on domestic tourism, is to have its grant
cut, the BTA, which represents Britain abroad, is being treated more gently.
The BTA grant of Pounds 32.1m is to increase to Pounds 33.5m in 1995.
An executive with one large UK hotel group said he thought the BTA was more
important. If necessary, it should be favoured at the expense of the ETB.
'If the cake has to be cut, that's the right way to cut it,' he said.
