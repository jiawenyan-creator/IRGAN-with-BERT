FT  26 FEB 93 / Observer: Speak up, Bill
Another small explosion behind the scenes at the new-look Labour party. Lord
Bill Wedderburn, Britain's leading authority on trade union law, has
resigned from Labour's front bench in the Lords on the eve of its debate on
the trade union reform and employment rights bill.
Lord Wedderburn, the 65-year-old Cassel professor of commercial law at
London University, has spent the past 14 years fighting Conservative
industrial relations legislation in the Lords.
But he has grown increasingly frustrated at what he sees as the lack of
enthusiasm inside his party at resisting those parts of the latest measure
that curtail trade union rights.
Current Labour tactics consist of concentrating on opposing the abolition of
wages councils and trying to improve the government's bill on sex equality
issues, but keeping away from proposed changes in more sensitive clauses
that cover trade union organisation, such as the right of a worker to join
any union of his choice.
Wedderburn can't stand this sort of pussy-footing any longer and intends to
get on the record his own objections to the bill from the backbenches.
