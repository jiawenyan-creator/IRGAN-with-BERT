  [Text] Imprisoned chairman of Nigeria's Campaign for 
Democracy, Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti, says he has begun a hunger 
strike. In a letter from Alagbon Police Station in Lagos to the 
attorney general and justice minister, Olu Onagoruwa, Dr. 
Ransome-Kuti said he had been kept in appalling circumstances 
without food. He said that after reporting to the police last 
week, he should have been kept in court or granted bail. Dr. 
Ransome-Kuti was jailed after the Campaign for Democracy called 
for street protests against the military government, to mark the 
anniversary of last year's annulled presidential elections on 12 
June.
