FT  14 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: Spanish inflation swings upward
Higher telephone tariffs helped to push Spain's headline inflation rate up
by 0.6 per cent in August, but the annual consumer price index was unchanged
at 4.8 per cent. Underlying inflation, which excludes fresh food and energy,
rose by 0.4 per cent to lift the year-on-year rate to 4.5 per cent against
4.3 per cent in July. The figures reverse a falling inflation trend over the
past months and look certain to delay interest rate cuts forecast by the
economy minister last week. Registered unemployment was meanwhile reported
to have dropped by just under 30,000 last month to 2.5m, 16.3 per cent of
the labour force. The seasonally adjusted figure is estimated to have fallen
by 14,000, the biggest fall in August since the 1988-89.
Norway's August trade surplus fell sharply to NKr1.6bn from NKr5.7bn in July
and compared with NKr5.2bn a year ago. The decline was caused by a 22 per
cent drop in oil and gas exports because of summer field maintenance.
Switzerland's second quarter industrial production was 10 per cent higher
than in 1993.
