FT  05 JAN 93 / Motive sought for 'contract' murder
POLICE investigating the killing of Mr Donald Urquhart, a London property
consultant, were still searching for a motive yesterday, Richard Donkin
writes.
Detectives were making inquiries in the Marylebone area of London's West End
where Mr Urquhart, 55, was shot on Saturday night by a man who escaped on a
motorcycle. Police are convinced that the shooting was the work of a
professional killer.
The businessman had property dealings through a company called Bellgap and
was part-owner of the Elstree Golf Club at Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.
Police are examining files stored in Mr Urquhart's car, a stretched Rover
827, which he used as a mobile office. Scotland Yard said: 'There is no
evidence to suggest he was involved in anything illegal.'
