FT  22 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour MPs back stance on Serbs
LABOUR MPs yesterday rallied around the party leadership's calls for air
strikes on Serb supply and communication lines in Bosnia - but signalled
they believe still more decisive action may yet be needed, Ralph Atkins
writes.
Mr John Smith, party leader, won support at a meeting of the parliamentary
Labour party for calling for air strikes if Serbs make further advances.
However, more than 50 Labour MP last night signed a Commons motion urging
the UN to issue an ultimatum against the Serbs, 'and, should that fail, to
take decisive military action'. Some Labour MPs continue to press for the
sending of ground troops.
Mr Smith has hardened his position over the last week. To the surprise of
some, however, pressure for taking a stronger stance has come from leftwing
MPs who were nervous about Britain's military involvement in the gulf war.
