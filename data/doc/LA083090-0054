JOHN ARTHUR BOLGER; RETIRED SOUND ENGINEER 
John Arthur Bolger, an Oscar-nominee sound engineer for Universal Pictures and 
longtime North Hollywood resident, has died in Woodland Hills. He was 82. 
Bolger died Aug. 22 of pneumonia, said his wife, Bessie Bolger. 
A native of England, Bolger came to the United States in the early 1920s and 
settled in North Hollywood in 1924. He went to work in the electrical 
department of Universal Pictures in 1925 but later became a sound engineer with 
the rise of "talkies" in the late 1920s. 
He worked on hundreds of films, including "The Countess of Monte Cristo" 
(1934), "Bedtime for Bonzo" (1951) and "Earthquake" (1974). In 1976, the year 
he retired, Bolger was nominated for an Academy Award for his work on "The 
Hindenburg." 
He is survived by his wife of 60 years; sons Donald Bolger of southern Oregon 
and Garrie Bolger of Burbank; five grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter. 
A memorial service was held last week at St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church 
in North Hollywood, where Bolger had been a regular member. The Neptune Society 
in Burbank handled the arrangements.
