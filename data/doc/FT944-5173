FT  05 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Close Brothers to expand via Pounds 105m
syndicated loan
Close Brothers Group, the merchant bank, is expected to announce today that
it has taken out a Pounds 105m syndicated loan to finance further growth of
its own loan book.
Of the funds Pounds 65m will be used to fuel an expansion of its asset
finance and leasing operations, which stands in contrast to flat lending by
the UK clearing banks.
'We've been growing the loan book pretty quickly when others have been going
backwards or sideways,' said Mr Rod Kent, managing director.
Close Brothers's lending has benefited from strong growth at its core
clientele of domestic small and medium-sized businesses. They have recovered
more rapidly than the large companies to which the UK clearing banks are
most exposed.
Factoring operations, Close Brothers's own included, have reported growth in
turnover at clients of 20 per cent this year. Lenders to small companies
have also suffered less from the shift of corporate borrowers from banks to
capital markets.
Close Brothers obtained the loan from a syndicate led by Barclays Bank at a
spread of 35 basis points over the London interbank market.
That compares with 60 basis points when the bank borrowed last year; the
change demonstrates the liquidity and narrowing of spreads on the syndicated
loan market.
The bank specialises in factoring and financing the purchase of print
machinery and insurance premiums.
Its loan book has grown at a compound rate of 25 per cent over the last four
years and stood at Pounds 406m in July.
Close Brothers, the fifth largest quoted UK investment bank, sustained its
record of unbroken profit growth over the last decade in its last annual
results. The company announced pre-tax profits for the year to July 31 ahead
from Pounds 17.8m to Pounds 33.1m.
