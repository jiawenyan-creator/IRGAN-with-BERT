  [Text] Russia's Fuel and Energy Ministry has not drafted 
any special document for President Clinton's visit to Moscow, 
Interfax was told by a ministry official, commenting on 
speculation about possible initiatives during the visit on 
cooperation in the sphere of fuel and energy. Although he did 
not rule out some urgent requests from the government, he 
emphasized that usually departments were asked to prepare 
applicable documents in advance. 
  Nonetheless, he suggested that Russian and American 
negotiators might discuss cooperation in the field and air 
appropriate "intentions". 
  As Interfax has learned, the sides have several big projects 
at various stages of readiness, which could place U.S. firms 
among the biggest investors in Russia's fuel and energy complex. 
According to one plan to get under way within the next few 
weeks, Russia will receive a $2 Bn loan under U.S. export-import 
bank guarantees to buy American oil and gas extracting 
equipment. Besides, a project to develop two oil fields on the 
Sakhalin shelf is in the final stage of preparation. The deal 
is estimated at $10 Bn and involves three U.S. firms. Russian 
officials are also considering a possible lucrative contract 
with Texaco to extract oil in the Archangelsk region and advance 
its infrastructure. The project could take 50 years to 
implement at the cost of over $50 Bn.
