Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action establishes Class E airspace at Port Huron, MI. A standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been
developed at St. Clair County International Airport. Controlled airspace to the surface is needed to contain instrument
flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace
for IFR operators executing the recently established SIAP.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
History


On December 9, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at Port Huron, MI (58 FR 64710). An Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS) has been installed
at the St. Clair County International Airport that will continuously provide weather data, and a non-federal ILS
SIAP has been established. Controlled airspace to the surface is needed to contain IFR operations at the airport.

Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received.
Minor changes have been made to the legal description to add an exclusion for the portion overlying Canadian airspace,
to eliminate specification of dates and times of operation since this Class E airspace will operate continuously,
and to correct the latitude coordinates. Other than these editorial changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed
in the notice. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E2 airspace designations
are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is
incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this
document will be published subsequently in the Order.


The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Port Huron, MI, to provide
controlled airspace to the surface for aircraft executing the ILS SIAP into the St. Clair County International Airport.
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 16, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
