  [Text] Like Mexico and Korea, Brazil is seeking to become a 
full member of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD). 
  The EBRD, which was created to help rebuild Eastern Europe, 
is chaired by former IMF Managing Director Jacques de Larosiere. 
  Brazilian Ambassador to London Rubens Barbosa has met 
Larosiere to give him the Brazilian Central Bank's acceptance of 
an invitation to send representatives to the annual EBRD meeting 
to be held in St. Petersburg.
