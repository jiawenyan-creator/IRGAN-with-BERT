FT  14 AUG 92 / Observer: Old friends
An Australian sugar cane farmer rammed his tractor into a horse box
yesterday to rescue his pet pig Penny from government officials. Penny, a
razorback or feral pig, was being taken to a research centre after elderly
women complained that it had been attacking them.
Penny, who tips the scales at around 160kg, has a drinking problem. She
can't say no to a beer, gets drunk and gets into fights. So the board gave
Penny's owner an ultimatum; destroy her or enrol her in a breeding
programme. But when it came time to say goodbye, owner Boris Radic changed
his mind.
