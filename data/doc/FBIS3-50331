Commander Vice Admiral Ventseslav Velkov on 27 January; place 
not given] 
  [Text] At a news conference today, Navy Commander Vice 
Admiral Ventseslav Velkov declared that 80 percent of the 57 
fighting ships and 37 auxiliary vessels and launches in the 
Bulgarian Navy are obsolete. The navy is at the limit of its 
combat readiness, he said, and our sailors may not manage to 
hold out unless finances are allocated in the Navy budget to 
overcome the problems. 
  [Begin Velkov recording] Most Bulgarians, for one reason or 
another, use the sea only for recreation, and they do not see 
the big problems that face Bulgaria as a naval power. [end 
recording] 
  It is very expensive to maintain the old vessels, but no 
money is available to buy new ones. The submarines have had 
their armaments removed, but to acquire a new one someone will 
have to cough up about $170 million. A fighting frigate is too 
expensive for us; one costs 350 million German marks. At the 
moment there is not enough money even for repairs.
