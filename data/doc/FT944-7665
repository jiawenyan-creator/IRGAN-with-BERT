FT  23 NOV 94 / Clinton dismisses latest venomous outburst by Helms
President Bill Clinton last night dismissed the latest assault from Senator
Jesse Helms as 'unwise and inappropriate' and all but issued an invitation
to the Republicans running Congress not to appoint the arch-conservative as
the next chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee.
His remarks came at the end of an extraordinary day which began with a North
Carolina newspaper quoting the local senator as saying that Mr Clinton had
'better have a bodyguard' if he ever visited military bases in the state, so
unpopular was the president with servicemen.
That was enough to get the Secret Service, which investigates all threats
against the president, into the act. It said it wanted to see a transcript
of Mr Helms's remarks, which seemed to go even further than his
controversial weekend comments that Mr Clinton was unfit to be
commander-in-chief.
By mid-afternoon, after party colleagues beyond number had run a mile from
his remarks, Mr Helms had repented somewhat. A statement said: 'I made a
mistake last evening which I shall not repeat.' His 'somewhat informal'
comments had been taken 'too literally' and, of course, Mr Clinton was
welcome to visit North Carolina. But he then went on to list all the reasons
why he thought Mr Clinton was unpopular with the military - his avoidance of
service in the Vietnam War, his ending of discrimination against serving
homosexuals and his defence budget cuts.
Mr Clinton's reaction was magisterially severe. He first dismissed the
senator's attacks and went on: 'The president oversees the foreign policy of
the US,' and 'the GOP (Republicans) will decide in whom they repose their
trust and confidence - that's a decision for them to make, not me.'
