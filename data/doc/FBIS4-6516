  [Text] Seoul, April 21 (YONHAP) -- The government is 
reportedly planning to enter a court dispute between Korean and 
American corporations over patent violation by presenting a 
brief of amicus curiae at the U.S. federal court to defend the 
rights of the Korean company. 
  When the Iljin Group files an appeal early next month 
against 
a ruling in favor of General Electric Co. by the federal court 
of Boston last January and its order of a seven-year halt to 
production of synthetic diamonds as well as immediate disposal 
of manufacturing equipment, the Foreign Ministry will attach a 
brief of amicus curiae, a ministry official said Thursday. 
  The case will be the first time that the government has gone 
all the way for a local firm in a foreign court. 
  "We hired a local lawyer to examine the U.S. federal court 
decision and decided to act against the parts we find 
unreasonable by explaining our side through a brief of amicus 
curiae," the official said. 
  A brief of amicus curiae is a form of legal advice given by 
a 
third party, such as the government or an economic body, 
advocating the rights of the concerned company from their 
country in its appeal in an international court dispute. 
  In its brief, the government will state that Iljin's 
technology was developed in a joint state project with the Korea 
Institute of Science and Technology and the Seoul National 
University Institute, and that the order to destroy even the 
manufacturing equipment is unjust. 
  Amicus curiae is relatively unknown in Korea, but its legal 
efficacy has frequently produced success in Japan, Switzerland, 
the Netherlands and Britain, the official said. 
  He added that the ministry will work on various measures to 
protect the rights of Korean companies advancing overseas in an 
era of heated trade competition. 
  The Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) will send a 
separate letter to GE's chairman asking the company to relent in 
its suit against Iljin.
