FT  29 OCT 93 / Salvation Army given right to recover Dollars 1.25m
A HIGH COURT judge yesterday ordered that the Salvation Army had the right
to recover up to Dollars 1.25m in payments, which may have been channelled
to a Birmingham businessman and one of his companies as part of an alleged
fraud.
Sir Peter Pain approved the declaration relating to Mr Stuart Ford and Tilen
Securities, one of his companies. Both are named in a writ issued by the
Salvation Army earlier this year in an attempt to recover up to Dollars 8.8m
that was intended for letters of credit.
The order came at the end of two days of oral examination of Mr Ford on his
assets by lawyers at Slaughter &amp; May on behalf of the Salvation Army. The
hearing was held in public at the request of Mr Ford.
Ms Claire Reffin, acting for Slaughter &amp; May, alleged that Mr Ford had
'salted away' money in bank accounts and bought jewellery that had not been
disclosed in statements of his assets.
Mr Ford denied those charges and said that more than Pounds 250,000 traced
to his accounts had been spent on house and office repairs and extensions,
on living and travel expenses and on repaying debts.
He admitted that he had sold two cars and an expensive wrist-watch since his
assets were frozen. That was in addition to a Pounds 300 a week allowance
permitted by the injunction.
After the examination Mr Ford issued a statement. 'I have made it clear
today and all along that I did not in any way defraud the Salvation Army,'
he said.
