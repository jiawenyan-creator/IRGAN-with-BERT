FT  18 JUN 92 / International Company News: Digital reorganises European
operations
DIGITAL Equipment, the world's third-largest information technology group
after IBM and Fujitsu, is reorganising its European operations in a bid to
restore flagging sales and profitability. The changes, which will create a
single organisation for Europe, take effect from July 1.
The reorganisation, pioneered by Digital's UK subsidiary over a year ago,
removes the company's geographically divided management structure in favour
of one focused on industrial sectors.
The company has created five industrial sectors across Europe, including
financial services, manufacturing and telecommunications. Within each sector
entrepreneurial units have been formed to concentrate on individual
industries and companies.
Mr Geoffrey Shingles, chairman of Digital's UK subsidiary, said: 'For the
first time we can look at our business industry by industry and company by
company.'
The reorganisation removes one layer of management, reducing the managerial
structure to three levels. Managements in individual countries will remain,
but they will be responsible principally for providing services and
resources to the industrial units. These include human resources, legal,
financial and communications activities.
Digital is the world's largest manufacturer of minicomputers for commercial
and technical customers, but it has been severely hit by moves to networks
of personal computers and workstations which provide equivalent power to
minicomputers at a lower cost.
It reported a third-quarter loss of Dollars 294m on operating revenues of
Dollars 3.25bn, and has been cutting staff for over two years in attempts to
restore profitability.
