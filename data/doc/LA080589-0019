PILOT INJURED IN PLANE CRASH DURING LANDING NEAR LANCASTER 
A private plane crashed while trying to make an emergency landing at General 
William J. Fox Airfield north of Lancaster on Friday, injuring the pilot. 
Donald E. Simanski, 49, who suffered a head cut and a back injury, was in 
serious condition at Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center in Lancaster, 
where he was taken by helicopter about 20 minutes after his plane crashed just 
west of Sierra Highway near Avenue D-8. 
Simanski, a Lancaster resident flying a twin-engine Piper Apache, radioed the 
control tower at the airfield shortly before 12:40 p.m. and reported that he 
was losing power and would attempt an emergency landing, Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department officials said. 
Simanski attempted one landing approach, then told tower personnel he would 
have to try again, Sgt. Ron Shreves said. 
"He made a low pass but did not land," Shreves said. "He said his left engine 
was out." 
Plane Lost Power 
Witnesses said the plane lost power and altitude as it headed east, apparently 
preparing to turn into the wind and attempt another landing approach to the 
airfield about five miles to the southwest. 
"The wind just flipped him over," said Jim Deppe, who watched the incident from 
a nearby house. 
Another witness, Anthony Matranga, said he was the first to reach the wreckage 
of the plane, which skidded across the field and through a barbed wire fence 
before stopping on its shattered nose and left wing. Simanski's head was 
bleeding, but he was conscious and able to talk, Matranga said. 
Eight people who saw the crash or its aftermath helped pull Simanski from the 
cockpit before a sheriff's helicopter arrived, witnesses said. 
Officials of the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Transportation 
Safety Board and the airport said they had not yet determined the pilot's 
origin point and destination.
