ALMANAC / MILLION-DOLLAR DEALS: 2 O.C. CITIES IN TOP 15 MARKETS 
Almost 700 homes in California sold for $1 million or more in the first three 
months of this year, and two Orange County communities ranked among the top 15 
housing markets. 
Newport Beach and Laguna Beach ranked fifth and 12th, respectively, in a survey 
of home sales by Dataquick Information Systems of San Diego. In Newport Beach, 
there were 23 million-dollar home sales, while Laguna Beach recorded 12. The 
highest-priced home in both cities sold for $3.4 million. 
The most expensive house of all sold during the quarter was a 
13,423-square-foot mansion built in 1935 in the Bel Air area, a 15-bedroom, 
10-bath number that went for $9.25 million in January. 
The 685 sales for $1 million or more statewide represented about a 40% increase 
over the same quarter a year ago. In more than 30% of the deals, buyers paid 
cash, contrasted with just 7% of middle-of-the-road home markets. 
But $1 million won't go as far in Beverly Hills as it does in, say, Boise. A 
late-1989 Coldwell Banker price survey found that a similar-sized, 
middle-management executive home cost $916,666 in the wealthy Los Angeles 
suburb but just $82,667 in the Idaho capital.
