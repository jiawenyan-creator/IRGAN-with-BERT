 

The Treasury Department and the IRS have determined that the four above-referenced allowances provided by the Department
of Defense (and by the Department of Transportation), to the extent not excludable under other provisions of the Code
(such as section 217(g) or section 132(g)), are to be treated as subsistence or quarters allowances. Section 1.6122T
is added to provide that these allowances are excludable from gross income. The regulations also clarify that no deduction
is allowed for any expenses incurred in connection with a transfer to a new permanent duty station to the extent the
expenses are reimbursed by an excludable allowance. 
However, any expense that meets the definition of a 

moving expense

 as defined in section 217(b) and is not reimbursed continues to be deductible under current law. 
The temporary regulations are effective with respect to allowances for expenses incurred after December 31, 1993.
Allowances for expenses incurred prior to January 1, 1994, in connection with a transfer to a new permanent duty station
are excludable under section 217(g). 


Special Analyses 


It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a 
significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, 

a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been 
determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 
U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, 
therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. 
Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, these regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel
for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business. 



Drafting Information_The principal author of these temporary regulations is Leonard H. Friedman, Office of Assistant
Chief Counsel (Income Tax and Accounting). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated
in their development.
