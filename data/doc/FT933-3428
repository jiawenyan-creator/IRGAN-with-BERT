FT  14 SEP 93 / Observer: Gorby the Great
Would that Peter the Great were still ruling his empire. Well, that's one
school of thought; it seems that in the highest levels at the Kremlin,
Russia's elite falls into two camps when it comes to foreign policy.
According to a poll of 130 top Russian diplomats and politicians conducted
by the Moscow office of the Friedrich Ebert Fund, the German social
democratic think-tank, Moscow's foreign policy establishment is now divided
between the 'westernisers' - who favour a US or European-style democracy -
and the 'slavophiles' - who hanker after a return to a Peter the Great style
of government.
On the other hand, only 15 per cent would like to see a return to strong
authoritarian rule or dictatorship; even fewer - 4 per cent - think Russia
should once more become a superpower. More than half are content to be just
one of the world's five great powers; 30 per cent would be happy to make it
to the top 15.
A market system is favoured by 81 per cent and a majority thinks that
Mikhail Gorbachev was a good thing. Top of the list for favourite
non-Russian country was Germany.
But one of the poll's findings suggests that history does indeed repeat
itself. Most of those who participated believe that the current crop of
politicians is more corrupt, greedy, immoral, hypocritical and ruthless than
the pre-1985 communists.
