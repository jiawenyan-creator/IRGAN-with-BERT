FT  26 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price rises forecast for lead
and zinc
Zinc and lead prices are forecast to climb back fairly strongly in 1994 from
their extremely depressed current levels, but will probably turn down again
in 1996-97 and then remain flat into the next century.
According to the Australian Mineral Economic research consultancy, the price
of lead could average about USDollars 600 a tonne in 1994, compared with
USDollars 405 a tonne in 1993. 'Supplies of lead in concentrate, which are
extremely tight, will remain so until 1995, forcing metal inventories to
reduce to 'normal' levels in 1994,' it says. 'In these circumstances, it
must be predicted that lead prices will first overshoot 'normal' levels,
within the coming 12 months.'
However, the forecasters go on to note that the lead price usually
experiences short peaks and long slumps, and say that they expect a return
to 'slump conditions' after 1995, when they predict that the price will
reach USDollars 800 a tonne. Between 1997 and the year 2005, they predict
that the price will range from USDollars 650 to USDollars 725 (at 1992
values).
On the zinc front, they suggest that 'the current shortage of zinc
concentrate stocks can be anticipated to bring about a reduction in both
metal production and stocks in 1994, thus providing the basis for prices to
return to viable levels'.
They predict that the zinc price will average about USDollars 1,125 a tonne
in 1994. It is forecast to peak at around USDollars 1,625 in 1996, and then
head downwards for the rest of the decade.
Australia's coal mines are being threatened by 24-hour 'stop work' meetings,
as workers consider the implications of prices cuts agreed between the
nation's coal producers and the Japanese steel mills.
Mr John Maitland, president of the United Miners Federation, said the
meetings would be held over two weeks starting from February 8, and would
lead to one-day closures at various mines.
BHP Australia Coal announced on Monday that its negotiations had resulted in
price cuts of around eight per cent, and that shipments would also be
curtailed. News of the outcome of the negotiations sent coal-related shares
lower yesterday on the Australian Stock Exchange, with CRA, BHP, QCT
Industries and Coal &amp; Allied among the companies affected.
Some analysts warned that the possibility of similar cuts to iron ore prices
was also compounding the market's worries.
