FT  14 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Credit Foncier's Y75bn offering proves
attractive
Credit Foncier de France's Y75bn offering of eight-year bonds yesterday
commanded most of the attention in the Eurobond market, which is still
absorbing two large dollar fixed-rate offerings launched on Tuesday.
Finland's and Freddie Mac's global offerings, totalling Dollars 1.5bn each,
were both priced yesterday.
Dealers said demand for paper had been helped by the improvement in the
dollar's performance yesterday.
Finland's 10-year issue, priced at 55 basis points over the 10-year
Treasury, was bid at its launch spread of 55 basis points at the end of the
day's trading.
According to one of the underwriters, around 20 per cent was placed in Asia,
with the remainder split between the US and Europe. Freddie Mac's five-year
deal was priced at 17 basis points over the curve, in the middle of the
indicated range. At the end of the day, it was trading at 18 basis points
over the five-year Treasury.
Credit Foncier's deal was shortened to eight years from an initially-planned
maturity of 10 years, due to oversupply in the 10-year area, according to
co-lead manager Morgan Stanley.
Dealers said the issue was very attractively priced. With a coupon of 4.75
per cent, the bonds proved attractive to asset-swappers, who were able to
swap the bonds for floating-rate assets paying around 18 basis points over
yen Libor.
According to dealers, asset swaps on the bonds were completed into dollars
and French francs, as well as yen.
'Clearly, the deal was very cheaply priced,' said one underwriter. 'We have
been taking calls from people trying to get hold of the bonds all day.'
In the lira market, the European Investment Bank launched a L400bn offering
of 10.15 per cent bonds due 1998, fungible with an existing L1,000bn deal,
making it by far the largest offering in the Eurolira sector.
