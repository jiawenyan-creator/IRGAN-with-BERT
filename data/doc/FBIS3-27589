<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Hotline to Help Fight Labour Abuses"] </F>
  [Text] A nationwide hotline for reporting labour law 
violations will open soon, the Ministry of Labour announced 
recently. 
  The move is in response to growing complaints from workers, 
ministry officials said. 
  The tipline will enable citizens to directly contact labour 
officials, making it easier to supervise factories, said Ren 
Zeming, a senior labour official. 
  Over the past few years, more and more workers have had 
their 
rights violated, particularly in foreign-funded firms. 
  Since 1988 there have been 250,000 strikes and labour 
disputes, the Tianjin-based JINWANBAO evening paper said. 
  They were usually caused by ambiguous contracts, long hours, 
low pay and unsafe working conditions. 
  Most occurred In coastal areas where millions of Chinese 
workers have taken jobs in foreign-funded companies. 
  Even in the capital, workers in a foreign-funded enterprise 
went on strike against low pay before Spring Festival. 
  In response to these problems, some labour departments have 
opened local hotlines for reporting abuses. 
  Late last year in Shenzhen a hotline tip led to the 
investigation of a local hardware factory where 27 workers had 
lost their fingers because of unsafe machinery. The case was 
quickly settled. 
  The nationwide hotline will begin "as soon as possible," Ren 
said. 
  Phone calls from the public will keep labour departments 
abreast of all news Ren noted. 
  He also said those who call can remain anonymous. And 
relevant departments will protect informers from retaliation.
