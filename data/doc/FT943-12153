FT  27 JUL 94 / Moscow sell-off decree
A new decree allowing Russian privatisation to continue gives companies the
right to own the land on which they stand. Mr Dmitry Vasiliev, deputy
privatisation minister, said yesterday this would enable companies to sell
surplus land, or use it to raise cash to restructure and modernise. The
decree, a substitute for legislation blocked by parliament, drops original
provisions for much broader land privatisation (which is to be covered by
separate legislation if approved by parliament). It also gives local
authorities the right to set the price, above a government-established
minimum threshold, at which shares in privatised companies can be sold to
the public. Employees will continue to be able buy shares at a discount, and
the final decision-making on the sale of the biggest companies is switched
from the privatisation ministry to President Boris Yeltsin's office. In
practice, this means that local authorities will be able to negotiate their
fate directly with presidential officials - behind closed doors. According
to a senior official, 103,000 out of 140,000 state-owned companies were sold
in the first stage of privatisation for vouchers given free of charge to
every citizen.
