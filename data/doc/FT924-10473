FT  30 OCT 92 / Observer: At the coalface
The sudden transfer of Robert Priddle out of his job as deputy secretary
responsible for energy matters at the Department of Trade and Industry
followed uncomfortably close on the heels of the recent debacle over coal
pit closures.
The DTI, which has put Priddle in charge of the corporate and consumer
affairs division, insists that this 'career move' simply frees the
department from any accusation that the review of energy policy on which it
has now embarked was in danger of being pre-judged.
The review will be headed instead by Priddle's successor, Charles Henderson,
a 53-year-old civil servant who is also a qualified actuary. Henderson has
done spells in various energy divisions of government, though his most
recent post was as head of the Office of Arts and Libraries.
Described by colleagues as personable and endowed with the necessary sense
of humour, he includes mountaineering among his interests - doubtless of
much use as he labours with the piles of paper which the three-month energy
review is certain to produce.
