<DOCTITLE>Indiana Michigan Power Co.; Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2</DOCTITLE>



Exemption



I



Indiana Michigan Power Company (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating Licenses Nos. DPR58 and
DPR74 which authorize operation of the Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, at steady-state reactor
power levels not in excess of 3250 and 3411 megawatts thermal, respectively. The Donald C. Cook facilities are pressurized
water reactors located at the licensee's site in Berrien County, Michigan. These licenses provide, among other things,
that they are subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission)
now or hereafter in effect.




II



Pursuant to 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1), ``Each licensee shall_(1) Successfully complete a requalification program developed
by the facility licensee that has been approved by the Commission. This program shall be conducted for a continuous
period not to exceed 24 months in duration.''





III



By letter dated October 4, 1993, the licensee requested an exemption from administering the operating portion of
the annual operator requalification examination in JanuaryFebruary, 1994 due to the installation of modifications
in the control room. The modifications, which include replacing all Foxboro controllers with Taylor model 30 controllers
and a reconfiguration of the control room, have been completed in the simulator but will not be installed in the Unit
1 and Unit 2 control rooms until the refueling outages in February and August, 1994, respectively.

The licensee is requesting the exemption from the operational portion of the requalification examination in order
to provide more simulator training time on the new modifications and to avoid administering a requalification examination
on a simulator which is configured differently from the plant control rooms. The licensee will administer the operating
portion of the requalification examination on the simulator in the MayJune, 1994 time frame. The licensee's
24-month requalification cycle ends February 11, 1994; therefore, the exemption from the requirements of the regulation
would be for a period of approximately 4 months.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 55.11, ``The Commission may, upon application by an interested person, or upon its own initiative,
grant such exemptions from the requirements of the regulations in this part as it determines are authorized by law
and will not endanger life or property and are otherwise in the public interest.''



IV



Currently, the Donald C. Cook Licensed Operator Requalification Training Program beings and ends in early February
of even years. This one-time exemption would permit an operating examination from the current 24-month requalification
cycle to be administered approximately 4 months into the next cycle. The next examination will be administered on
schedule in January 1995, which will be consistent with the annual examination requirement cited in 10 CFR 55.59(a)(2).



V



The staff has reviewed the licensee's request and concluded that issuance of this exemption will not endanger life
or property and will have no significant effect on the safety of the public or the plant.

Accordingly, the Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 55.11, that this exemption as described in section
III is authorized by law, will not endanger life or property and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the
Commission hereby grants a one-time exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1) for a period of February
1994 to June 1994, with respect to the 24-month requalification program. This exemption applies only to the operational
examination portion of the requalification program. No changes to the written portion of the requalification program
have been requested by the licensee or granted by this exemption.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that granting of this exemption will have no significant impact
on the environment (February 14, 1994, 59 FR 6978).

This exemption is effective upon issuance.




Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 15th day of February, 1994.
