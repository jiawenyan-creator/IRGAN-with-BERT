FT  17 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Reports of easier credit
prompt late rally
SHARE prices surged in the last 15 minutes of trading, on reports that the
central bank was loosening its monetary policy. Bond and futures markets
were also stronger, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed up 117.77 at 26,813.30 as dealers scrambled to
cover their positions. The index rose to the day's high of 26,894.27 on
index buying in the morning but fell into negative territory in the
afternoon, hitting the day's low of 26,615.35.
Volume remained subdued at 380m shares. Gainers led losers by 499 to 467,
with 180 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 6.77 to
2,018.83 and, in London trading, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.34 to
1,520.8.
Reports quoted a Bank of Japan source who said that monetary policy had
shifted from tight to neutral, and that the central bank intended to lower
overnight call rates, which have been kept at 8.3 per cent since
mid-February, to around 8 per cent.
The yield on the 10-year 129 benchmark bond eased 0.095 percentage points to
6.625, and June stock futures closed up 130 points at 27,380, 0.7 per cent
above theoretical value.
Miss Caroline Stone at Barclays de Zoete Wedd said that sentiment improved
during the last few minutes of trading, and that today should attract strong
buying.
Interest rate-sensitive issues were sought in the last-minute rush, and
large capital issues climbed in active trading. Nippon Steel, the most
active issue of the day, added Y10 to Y495, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
gained Y7 to Y803, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Y6 to Y639.
Oil shares were strong on the back of rising oil prices after the World Bank
forecast of a significant decline in Soviet oil output. Nippon Oil gained
Y50 to Y1,140 and Mitsubishi Oil added Y30 to Y1,200.
Trading companies, which had been popular recently because of their ties
with the Soviet Union, lost ground. Brokers had encouraged investors to buy
Soviet-related stocks ahead of President Mikhail Gorbachev's visit which
started yesterday, but concerns over the domestic situation in the Soviet
Union prompted profit-taking. Mitsui lost Y9 to Y827.
Fuji Electric, an electric machinery maker, rose Y13 to Y890 on expectations
of increased capital spending by electric power companies. Kyudenko, an
electrical engineering company, rose Y60 to Y2,220 on similar hopes.
The warm weather lifted apparel shares. Renown Look climbed Y70 to Y1,780,
and Naigai climbed Y80 to Y1,350.
In Osaka the OSE average added 62.96 to 30,057.50 on low volume of 31.4m
shares. Large capitals lost ground on profit-taking, and investors focused
on short-term trading in secondary shares.
Murata, a ceramic capacitor maker, rose Y40 to Y2,680 on news that it
planned to start mass-production of electrical parts, with projected annual
sales of Y7bn.
Roundup
POLITICAL fears in Taiwan produced the most outstanding feature in a region
marked by profit-taking yesterday. Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta were
closed for public holidays.
TAIWAN fell by 6.3 per cent as the weighted index suffered the year's
largest single-day decline to close 358.14 lower at 5,313.31. Turnover fell
from TDollars 84.6bn to TDollars 78.4bn.
All eight deputies of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party withdrew
on Monday from a three-week extraordinary session of the National Assembly
on constitutional changes and vowed to take to the streets to demonstrate
for faster democratic reforms. However, analysts also said that there was
profit-taking following a six-day rally which had pushed the index up by
326.61.
MANILA blamed profit-taking for a 5.44 fall in the composite index to
1,090.46 after two days of gains.
Dealers said that stocks were hitting resistance levels, citing the case of
Philippine National Bank. PNB reached a high of 400 pesos a share, but once
it touched this mark 25 brokers came in as sellers, compared with eight
buyers at 397.50 pesos. PNB closed up 12.50 pesos at 397.50 pesos.
BANGKOK had its own political worries as fears of protests against
legislation disbanding labour unions at state enterprises came in to weaken
an early rally. The SET index closed just 1.37 higher at 886.03 after an
early gain of about 8 points. Turnover was 3.84bn baht.
AUSTRALIA, on the other hand, took in its stride the first bond tender in
almost two years and a government announcement that Australian workers will
get an immediate 2.5 per cent wage increase under the country's centralised
wage fixing system. Strategists said that the latter announcement had little
in the way of inflationary implications.
The All Ordinaries index added 9.0 to 1,471.7, its fourth consecutive rise,
stiffened by a good performance in industrials. Turnover rose from ADollars
141m to ADollars 164m.
Coles Myer, the nation's biggest retailer, rose 8 cents to ADollars 9.84
following a 24 cent rise on Monday. It has applied to the Australian Stock
Exchange to lift its weighting on the All Ordinaries index. Brokers said
that this had helped drive the shares up, because investors in index-linked
funds might have to increase their holdings.
NEW ZEALAND closed with the Barclays index 10.24 lower at 1,425.65 on
profit-taking after an advance of 8.1 per cent in the previous ten sessions.
Turnover stayed high, rising from NZDollars 25.3m to NZDollars 30.8m, as
dealers said that a climb in the New Zealand dollar against its Australian
counterpart had also tended to dampen buying of issues which were also
traded in Australia.
