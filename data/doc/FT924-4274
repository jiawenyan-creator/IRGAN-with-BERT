FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Treasury hint on insider law
THE TREASURY has indicated to City institutions that it will consider
changing its widely criticised proposals for tougher rules on insider
dealing when MPs debate the legislation next year.
The government will face pressure in the House of Lords today over proposals
in the Criminal Justice Bill that many in the City fear define insider
dealing too broadly, outlawing some legitimate practices in the financial
markets.
The government will try to block amendments tabled by Lord Mottistone - a
Tory peer advised by the Confederation of British Industry - which it
regards as unworkable. But Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the
Treasury, has indicated that he will consider seriously any proposals for
change when the bill moves to the Commons - probably in January.
Under Lord Mottistone's proposals, the Treasury would be forced to publish
precise guidelines on the offence of insider dealing and exempt anybody who
followed the guidelines.
The bill, intended to align UK law with the European Community's insider
dealing directive, defines an 'insider' as anyone who has inside information
as a result of their employment, profession or duties. It is expected to
become law in May.
