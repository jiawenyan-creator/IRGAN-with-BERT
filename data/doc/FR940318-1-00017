 

The Proposed Amendment 


Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration
proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: 


PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 


1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: 





Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 


39.13

[Amended] 


2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 395250 (51 FR 7767, March 6, 1986), and by adding a new airworthiness
directive (AD), to read as follows: 





Boeing:

 Docket No. 90NM265AD. Supersedes AD 860507, Amendment 
395250. 





Applicability: 

All Model 727 series airplanes, certificated in any category. 


Compliance:

 Required as indicated, unless previously accomplished. 
To prevent engine damage or separation, airframe damage, and/or hazard to persons or property on the ground as a result
of ``blue ice'' that has formed from leakage of the lavatory drain system and dislodged from the airplane, accomplish
the following: 
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this AD, accomplish the applicable procedures specified in paragraphs
(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) of this AD: 
(1) For each lavatory drain system, forward or aft, that has an in-line drain valve installed, Kaiser Electroprecision
part number 26513295 (or higher dash number): Within 1,500 flight hours after the effective date of
this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 1,500 flight hours, accomplish the following: 
(i) Conduct a leak check of the dump valve (in-tank valve that is spring loaded closed and operable by a T-handle at the
service panel), ball valve, and cap valve. The ball valve and cap valve leak checks must be performed with a minimum
of 3 pounds per square inch differential pressure (PSID) applied across each valve. If the cap valve has an inner door
with a second positive seal, only the inner door must be tested. 
(ii) Visually inspect the seal on the outer door for wear or damage that may cause leakage. Any worn or damaged seal must
be replaced, prior to further flight, in accordance with the valve manufacturer's maintenance manual. 
(2) For each lavatory drain system, forward or aft, that has a service panel drain valve installed, Kaiser Electroprecision
part number 021800328 (or higher dash number) or Shaw Aero Devices part number 10101000CN (or
higher dash number): Within 1,000 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not
to exceed 1,000 flight hours, conduct a leak check of the dump valve and drain valve. The drain valve leak check must
be performed with a minimum of 3 PSID applied across the valve. 
(3) For other forward or aft lavatory drain systems not addressed in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this AD: Within 200
flight hours after the effective date of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 200 flight hours, conduct
a leak check of the dump valve and the drain valve at the service panel. The drain valve leak check must be performed with
a minimum 3 PSID applied across the valve. 
(4) For flush/fill lines: Within 5,000 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, and thereafter at intervals
not to exceed 5,000 flight hours, conduct a leak check of the cap on the flush/fill line. This leak check must be made
with a minimum of 3 PSID applied across the cap. 
(5) If a leak is discovered during any leak check required by paragraph (a) of this AD, prior to further flight, accomplish
one of the following procedures:
