  [Text] Kiev, 9 December -- In its bulletin of 8 December 
1993, carrying a report entitled "Ukraine Satisfied With 
Retargeting Missiles," the private English-speaking news agency 
Intelnews quotes the director of the press center of the 
Ukrainian Defense Ministry, Ihor Melnychenko, as saying that "a 
group of scientists is working on breaking the codes of 
Ukrainian missiles. If we get these codes, we shall then be 
able to retarget the missiles." 
  The press service of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry has 
officially denied this report and stated that no such data has 
been provided for the Intelnews agency by representatives of the 
Ukrainian Defense Ministry. Ukraine exercises administrative 
control over nuclear weapons and is taking steps to prevent the 
use of them. 
  The Defense Ministry press service's report points out that 
the establishment of the press service does not have such a post 
as the director and that the service does not employ a member of 
staff with such a name as Melnychenko.
