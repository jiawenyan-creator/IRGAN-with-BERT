FT  11 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Radamec benefits from Gulf war
A good performance by its equipment in the Gulf war contributed to
confidence in the future at Radamec Group, the electronics and mechanical
engineering concern. The number of orders received towards the end of the
year improved and there was a high level of inquiries.
Mr Len Whittaker, chairman, said that Radamec Defence Systems' own equipment
and that incorporated into other companies' products performed well in the
Gulf. 'Electro-optic surveillance systems with passive day and night
operating capability were seen to provide a new dimension to military
operations.'
In 1990 the company cut its taxable loss from Pounds 3.39m to Pounds 396,000
by improved sales and increased efficiency. The company was said to have
been trading profitably since the beginning of the present year.
Operating profit for the year under review was Pounds 153,000 (Pounds 1.84m
losses) before interest charges down to Pounds 549,000 (Pounds 711,000).
Turnover was Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 9.69m) and losses per share were 1.8p
(17.4p).
