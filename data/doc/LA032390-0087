Doctors were able to save the baby of a pregnant woman who was shot and killed 
by a neighbor as she strolled with a toddler near her Lynwood home, police and 
witnesses said Thursday. 
Antonia Avila, 22, was rushed on Wednesday to Martin Luther King Jr.

sheriff's spokesman Ernie Roop. The baby was in stable condition Thursday. 
Avila's neighbor, Melissa Rivas, 22, was booked on suspicion of murder, Roop 
said. 
Rivas and her boyfriend, Ray Villuu, 20, were arguing outside Rivas' Euclid 
Avenue home about 1 p.m. Wednesday when Villuu allegedly struck Rivas, Roop 
said. Rivas grabbed a pistol from inside the home and allegedly fired several 
rounds toward Villuu. 
Villuu, who was booked on suspicion of battery, was not hurt. But a bullet 
struck Avila in the back as she was walking nearby with a toddler in a 
stroller, Roop and witnesses said. Avila died after doctors removed the baby, 
Roop said.
