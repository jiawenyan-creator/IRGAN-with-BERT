FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Creditanstalt shows 13% decline
CREDITANSTALT, the big Austrian bank, has announced a 13 per cent decline to
Sch1.3bn (Dollars 124.5m) in operating profit for the first half of 1992.
Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, chairman, said the fall reflected the sharp rise in
short-term interest rates and the weakness of the Vienna stock market.
However, he predicted better results for the remainder of the year.
Partial operating earnings, which do not include profit from the bank's
own-account trading, declined 9.5 per cent to Sch845m. However, several of
Creditanstalt's regional banking subsidiaries managed higher profits.
Creditanstalt's performance is understood to be better than that of its
leading domestic rivals, however.
Bank Austria, the largest financial institution in the country, saw partial
profit drop 15 per cent in the six months, while GiroCredit has reportedly
suffered an even steeper setback. Neither of the two banks has yet published
results.
