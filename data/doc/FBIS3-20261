  [Text] The Greek Cypriots embarked on provocative 
activities together with several Kurdish militants close to the 
Greek Cypriot barricade near the Ledra Palace Hotel yesterday. 
It has become a tradition for the Greek Cypriots to engage in 
provocative activities on the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cyprus] border at every opportunity. Using the murder of 
Theofilos Yeoryiadhis as a pretext, a number of Greek Cypriot 
organizations rallied their supporters in Elevtheria Square and 
then marched to the barricade near the Ledra Palace Hotel. 
  Some 150 members of the youth organizations of EDEK [United 
Democratic Union of Cyprus], DISI [Democratic Rally], AKEL 
[Restorative Party of the Working People], and DIKO [Democratic 
Party] marched to the barricade together with a group of Kurdish 
militants, chanting Kurdish slogans and singing Kurdish songs as 
they did so. They staged a sit-down demonstration at the 
barricade. The Greek Cypriot and Kurdish militants continued to 
chant slogans and sing songs while they obstructed the traffic 
through the barricade. 
  That the demonstrators carried only Kurdish and Greek flags 
and not the flag of the so-called Cyprus Republic drew attention.
