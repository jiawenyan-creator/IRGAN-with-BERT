FT  02 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: GUS underpinned
Several bullish stories underpinned the sharp rise in Great Universal Stores
shares, which closed 20 ahead at 624p.
Most speculative was the suggestion in some market circles that GUS was
preparing plans to float off its property division, an old market story but
one which refuses to fade. GUS's investment properties were valued at Pounds
688m in the last accounts and produced Pounds 26.8m in rental income.
Another suggestion was that GUS was intending to pump Pounds 350m into the
property division, which is thought to have lagged behind its rivals in the
bidding stakes for new developments. A third, more pragmatic, reason for the
share price rise was that Cazenove, the company's broker, had upgraded its
profits forecasts. Cazenove refused to comment.
British Aerospace basked in the glow of the Pounds 800m deal to sell its 80
per cent stake in Rover, announced on Monday. The shares jumped 46 to 545p
in strong turnover of 16m as underweight fund managers previously nervous of
BAe bid for stock. Sentiment was further boosted by more profits upgrades
from brokers.
NatWest Securities increased its current year forecast by Pounds 55m to
Pounds 205m.
The Rover deal also boosted sentiment among motor component suppliers. GKN
bounced 21 to 604p, while Lucas Industries put on 9 at 223p in trade of
4.2m, supported by a weighty recommendation from NatWest Securities.
Further confirmation of the rapid growth in the cellular telephone market
came yesterday with new subscriber figures from Cellnet and Vodafone which
were ahead of market forecasts.
The latter's were marginally more impressive and pushed the shares 12 1/2
higher to 598p. UBS, the company's broker, moved from 'hold' to 'buy' on the
stock, lifting its current year profits forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 355m
and next year's by Pounds 15m to Pounds 405m. BT, co-owner of Cellnet,
slipped 4 1/2 to 470p, having run on strongly on Monday.
Conglomerate Hanson saw unusually heavy volume of more than 25m shares and
rose 4 1/4 to 292 1/2 p after Hoare Govett, the company's broker,
highlighted the benefits from a burgeoning US economy.
Hoare argues that at a time when US gross domestic product is expected to
grow at around 3 per cent the US contribution to Hanson's profits is poised
to increase from 47 per cent to 67 per cent. The house is also said to be
steering investors towards improved performances at Hanson's Quantum,
Suburban Propane, SCM Chemicals and Cavenham subsidiaries.
United Newspapers improved 17 to 708p after announcing that its US
subsidiary had bought Harmon Publishing Company for Dollars 100m. Ms Lorna
Tilbian of SG Warburg liked the deal because it was 'small, a good fit and
earnings enhancing'. Stock market analysts had been slightly concerned that
having got rid of its debts the newspaper group might go for a bigger prize,
such as conference organiser Blenheim, steady at 349p.
Television stocks remained buoyant. Yorkshire Tyne Tees, widely seen as the
next bid target, rose 17 to 258p and Ulster Television jumped 41 to 666p.
News International firmed 5 to 293p. Parent News Corporation is expected to
announce an earnings rise of more than 20 per cent for the six months to
December when it reports tomorrow.
Pharmaceuticals company Medeva rose 8 1/2 to 172p in response to an
announcement that the US Food and Drug Administration had published some
long-awaited guidelines on the selling of a version of inhaled asthma
treatment. Traders said overnight US buying helped fuel the rise. Also,
Goldman Sachs, the US investment house, upgraded its recommendation on the
stock.
Zeneca fell 12 to 794p, with BZW arguing that the shares were up with
events.
HSBC climbed 23 to 1014p on the back of a strong Hong Kong market. Sentiment
was also helped by news that Moody's Investors Services had upgraded the
subordinated debt of HSBC Holdings.
RTZ fell 12 to 883p, with Smith New Court said to be advising clients to
take profits.
Among building materials, BPB Industries added 8 at 359p. BZW upgraded the
group and reiterated its buy stance.
Regional stores group T&amp;S Stores announced strong December trading figures
and a new acquisition. The shares surged 29 to 197p.
Industrial gases group BOC added 9 1/2 at 731p as BZW reiterated its buy
recommendation ahead of first quarter results next week. Specialist paints
group Kalon improved 2 to 175p on the back of a Pounds 6.2m acquisition.
Speculation early in the session that the government was about to announce a
submarine order powered VSEL. The shares raced forward but closed only 27
ahead at 1020p, after it turned out that a Pounds 180m order to re-equip
British Trafalgar submarines had been won by Ferranti-Thomson.
UK airports operator BAA, which reported a 12.7 per cent improvement in
nine-month profits to Pounds 292m, relinquished 26 to 1055p. The shares were
hit by general profit-taking and advice from SG Warburg to switch into
British Airways, a penny easier at 473p.
