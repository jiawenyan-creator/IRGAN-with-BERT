FT  22 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Attack on life insurance industry
comes rather late in the day
Sir, How commendable it is that, once again, Mr Joel Joffe should bring the
misdeeds of those rascals in the life insurance industry to the public's
notice. He is to be thanked for this, the latest effort in his crusade
against these despicable people (Letters, June 18/19).
Of course, a cynic might well inquire as to the rationale behind his sudden
missionary zeal and further inquire as to why a man with such strongly held
views on such pressing matters did not chose to air them during his time
with a company - the name of which temporarily escapes me but, surely, not
one of those 'driven by an unprincipled disregard for the best interests of
the public' - and why he should now choose to bite the very hand that fed
him so well. But, of course, I am not that cynical.
In the meantime, as per Mr Joffe's calling, I for one willingly express my
deep regret for being a part of such a unregulated miasma and, yes, I
certainly am grateful to Mr Joffe's new-found friends, those financial
journalists of the school of incisive reporting, for their labours in this
field. However, it is Mr Joffe who really deserves our thanks and I shall
certainly sleep easy in my bed in the sure and certain knowledge that Mr
Joffe is still out there doing his bit for those of us still trying to earn
an honest shilling from the industry he now finds so distasteful.
