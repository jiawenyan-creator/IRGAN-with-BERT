Under 49 CFR 1180.4(g), a verified notice of exemption must be filed with the Commission at least one week before the
transaction is consummated. Because the notice of exemption was not filed until October 24, 1994, consummation should
take place on or after October 31, 1994, rather than October 30, 1994, as indicated in the verified notice of exemption.
Applicant's representative has confirmed that the correct consummation date is on or after October 31, 1994. 

</FOOTNOTE>


This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7). If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption
is void 

ab initio

. Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Gary A. Laakso, One Market
Plaza, Room 846, San Francisco, CA 94105. 

As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees affected by the trackage rights will be protected under
