  [Text] Seoul, March 3 (YONHAP) -- The U.S. official who 
caused a sensation in Seoul with his comments on South Korea 
needing to abolish its national security law, explained that he 
was stating his personal opinion and not that of his government, 
the Foreign Ministry said Thursday. 
  U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Tom Hubbard met 
with 
South Korean Embassy officials in Washington and explained he 
was commenting on basics while talking about overall South 
Korean-U.S. relations, Assistant Foreign Minister Choe Tong-chin 
told reporters. Hubbard was quoted as saying he is sorry about 
the controversy generated by his misstated expression of a 
sensitive problem. He also told South Korean officials he 
understands the extraordinary circumstances surrounding Korea, 
Choe said. 
  During a seminar held Feb. 25 at American University, 
Hubbard 
said South Korea and the United States differ on "how to respond 
on some regional and global issues." 
  "And despite heartwarming success in establishing democracy 
and marked improvement on the human rights front -- or perhaps 
because of them -- the United States still wishes the Republic 
of Korea would repeal the national security law," Hubbard said. 
  The incident created an immediate commotion here because 
Hubbard is the chief working-level U.S. negotiator with North 
Korea. Initial speculation went that the issue was raised during 
the recent North Korean-U.S. talks led by Hubbard. 
  South Korea's national security law prohibits any 
unauthorized contact with North Korea and any public statements 
or acts sympathetic to the North Korean regime. 
  U.S. Ambassador to Seoul James Laney called Foreign Minister 
Han Sung-chu Wednesday night to supply an explanation as well, 
Choe said.
