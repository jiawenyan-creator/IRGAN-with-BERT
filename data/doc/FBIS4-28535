  [Text] Seoul, June 4 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Korean 
Government has decided to import 39,000 tons of garlic and 
28,000 tons of onions to offset an expected shortage caused by a 
poor crop this year. The domestic supply of the pungent bulbs is 
expected to fall short of demand due to a poor harvest and a 
decrease in arable land, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry 
and Fisheries said Saturday. 
  This year's garlic and onion production is estimated at 
372,000 tons and 555,000 tons, respectively, compared to demand 
of 450,000 tons and 590,000 tons. Half of the garlic shortfall, 
39,000 tons, will be met by imports and the rest by early 
production of green and unripe garlic, the ministry disclosed. 
  Of the onion shortage, 28,000 tons will come from overseas 
and the remaining 7,000 tons from early production of a variety 
from Cheju Province. 
  This year's imports of garlic and onions will set records in 
terms of tonnage. The previous highs for garlic and onion 
imports were 19,000 tons in 1985 and 17,000 tons last year, 
respectively. 
  A ministry official said the bulbs will be imported from 
July 
to February 1995, adding imports for early next year will be 
covered by the minimum market access provided by the Uruguay 
Round. He explained that the ministry urged farmers last year to 
grow more garlic and onions, but the land set aside for 
cultivating garlic has decreased by 3.6 percent from the 
previous year while arable land for onions remained the same. 
  Meanwhile, the wholesale price of garlic last month was 
1,400 
won per kilogram, 33.5 percent higher than 1,050 won in the same 
month last year. Onions sold for 515 won per kg, a whopping 2.8 
times higher than the same month last year.
