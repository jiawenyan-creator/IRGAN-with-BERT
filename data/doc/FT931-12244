FT  29 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
COPPER prices fell back in late trading on the LME, with a less-active
market unable to sustain earlier rises. News that Chile's El Teniente could
process concentrate from Enami's Ventanas smelter if a strike took place
took the shine off the market. ALUMINIUM was firmer, helped by news that
Russia might crack down on tolling of metal by Western firms. GOLD held
steady on the London bullion market, but sentiment remains bearish and
dealers expect the market to retreat towards support at Dollars 328.
London's robusta COFFEE market closed with small losses in quiet but nervous
conditions as dealers waited to see if there would be any resumption in the
recent sharp decline. It appeared to be delicately poised with some
believing the market should now start to rebuild after this week's rapid
fall. New York COTTON prices were still ahead in late trading after a mild
technical bounce following the declines earlier this week. But prices
remained under severe technical presssure.
