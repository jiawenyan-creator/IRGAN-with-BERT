FT  24 JUN 94 / Welsh land reclamation wins praise from watchdog
Reclamation of derelict land in Wales has achieved good value for money, the
National Audit Office says in a report published today.
The NAO says the Welsh Development Agency's programme for reclamation has
cleared 13,000 acres of unsightly and hazardous land since 1976. Sir John
Bourn, head of the NAO, said it was widely recognised as a notable
achievement and had contributed to improvements in the environment and
economic development.
Land reclamation has been a high priority in Wales since the Aberfan coaltip
disaster in 1966. The WDA is responsible for managing the programme and
makes full grants to local authorities, which undertake more than 90 per
cent of the work. Spending is running at Pounds 35m a year and the agency's
objective, agreed with the Welsh Office, is to reclaim all significant
dereliction by the year 2000.
The NAO says the agency has made substantial progress in clearing the
backlog of key unsafe and unsightly sites. Eighteen sites were examined in
detail, with Ove Arup and Partners, consulting engineers, as advisers.
Good-quality reclamation had been achieved in 14 of the schemes and in the
other four it was adequate. Net costs were described as satisfactory.
