FT  29 FEB 92 / Letter: Morgan: applying a dictum well
Sir, Your leader, 'Perilous niches' (February 26), implies that the Morgan
Motor company manufactures instant antiques. Morgan cars perform their
designed purpose better than cars from the mass producers.
Occam said: 'It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer.' Morgan
applies the dictum very well.
For example, four-wheel steer is achieved by the dynamic characteristics of
the suspension while other manufacturers employ complex linkages, which will
suffer from wear; or, as BMW does, by means of electronic signals from
speedometer, front wheels and steering column operating hydraulic actuators
acting on the suspension.
As a consequence, Morgan will out-brake (even without ABS) and out-corner
other cars, to the good of primary safety.
