FT  23 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Credit Agricole in venture
with Lazard
Credit Agricole and the Lazard group have set up a joint company
specialising in structured finance.
Credit Agricole-Lazard Financial Products, based in London, will offer a
wide range of financial techniques to large international companies.
Unlike the financial products subsidiaries set up by CS First Boston and
Merrill Lynch, the unit is not designed as a vehicle for trading derivative
instruments.
An increasing proportion of corporate finance, including mergers and
acquisitions business, now involves structured transactions, often using
derivative instruments.
Mr Edouard Stern, a partner of Lazard Freres, cited Viacom's Dollars 9.5bn
agreed takeover of Paramount, which was helped by the offer of contingent
value rights, structured using derivatives, to Paramount shareholders.
Lazard was Paramount's adviser.
In the past, Lazard has used other houses for derivative transactions.
Credit Agricole, France's largest bank, is already a significant participant
in the debt and derivative markets, but has not been active in corporate
finance.
Under the partnership, Credit Agricole will provide the necessary capital
and trading muscle, while Lazard will provide the client list and corporate
finance expertise.
The amount of capital provided for the joint company was not disclosed, but
75 per cent is provided by the Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole and 25
per cent by the Lazard houses of London, Paris and New York.
The board of directors is made up equally of representatives of the two
shareholders.
