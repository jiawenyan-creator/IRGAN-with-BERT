FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Allied Colloids achieves 8% advance to
Pounds 42.1m
ALLIED COLLOIDS, the speciality chemicals company, reported an 8 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 38.8m to Pounds 42.1m, for the year
to March 28.
Although the figure was below market expectations the company issued an
upbeat statement about prospects and raised the final dividend to 3.02p
(2.7p) making a total of 3.9p compared with 3.5p.
While turnover in the first half was in line with expectations, sales in the
second half remained flat, reflecting the continuing recession across both
sides of the Atlantic.
Overall sales, however, rose by 9 per cent, from Pounds 232.9m to Pounds
254.5m, reflecting the group's lack of dependence on the UK market which
accounted for just 15 per cent of turnover.
Earnings increased from 9.88p to 12.3p, mainly as a result of an exceptional
tax credit.
The tax charge of Pounds 10.1m was exceptionally low because a provision for
deferred taxation of Pounds 5m relating to accelerated capital allowances
was considered no longer to be required.
Net assets increased from Pounds 130m to Pounds 145m, while gearing remained
low at 4.5 per cent.
