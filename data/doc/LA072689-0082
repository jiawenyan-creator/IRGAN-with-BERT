METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUROR ILLNESS DELAYS BUCKEY TESTIMONY 
The long-awaited testimony of defendant Raymond Buckey in the McMartin 
Pre-School molestation trial, scheduled to begin Tuesday, was delayed by the 
illness of a juror. 
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders sent remaining jurors home 
after one of their members called in to report that he was in pain and taking 
pain-killers after having had a tooth extracted Monday. 
Buckey, 31, who is charged with 52 counts of molestation and a shared count of 
conspiracy with his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, has maintained his 
innocence since his first arrest nearly six years ago. He did not testify at 
his preliminary hearing.
