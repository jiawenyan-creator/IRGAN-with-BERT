  [Text] Riga, Mar 31, BNS -- Latvian lawmakers approved 
rules Thursday [31 March] on the use of the media in local 
election race providing that one candidate from a list is 
entitled for free of charge campaign addresses in state radio 
and television. 
  Radio and television management should tell the audience 
before or after each address who paid for the broadcasting time, 
under the law. 
  The regulations do not refer to coverage of facts in direct 
broadcasts and news programs. 
  In addition, the parliament decided that a day before the 
elections and on the election day radio and TV broadcasts should 
not contain results of opinion polls on the popularity of 
political parties and election alliances.
