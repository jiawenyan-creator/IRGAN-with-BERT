(iv) The last shipment of milk received from the producer by the former plant did not test positive for drug residue;
and 
(v) Milk shipments currently are not excluded from the market due to a positive drug residue test.

5. Sec. C10. is revised to read as follows: 
Sec. C10. Field service.

 
A representative of the plant shall arrange to promptly visit the farm of each producer whose milk tests positive for
drug residue, exceeds the maximum somatic cell count level, exceeds the maximum bacterial estimate, or does not meet
the requirements for acceptable milk. The purpose of the visit shall be to inspect the milking equipment and facilities,
to offer assistance to improve the quality of the producer's milk, and eliminate any potential cause of drug residue.
A representative of the plant should routinely visit each producer as often as necessary to assist and encourage the
production of high quality milk. 
6. Sec. C11. is revised to read as follows: 
(a) A laboratory examination to determine the level of somatic cells shall be made on each producer's milk at least
four times in each 6-month period at irregular intervals. Samples shall be analyzed at a laboratory approved by the
State regulatory agency. 
(b) A screening test may be conducted on goat herd milk. When a goat herd screening sample exceeds either of the following
screening test results, a confirmatory test shall be conducted. 
(1) California Mastitis Test_Weak Positive (CMT 1). 
(2) Wisconsin Mastitis Test_WMT value of 18 mm. 
(c) Milk shall be tested for bacterial estimate by using one of the following methods or by any other method approved
by Standard Methods for the Examination of Dairy Products: 
(d) Milk shall be tested for somatic cell content by using one of the following procedures (confirmatory test for somatic
cells in goat milk):
