NEWSWIRE: ROSE'S LAWYERS WILL APPEAL RULING KEEPING LAWSUIT IN FEDERAL COURT 
Pete Rose's lawyers said Thursday in Cincinnati that they will appeal the 
decision to keep Rose's suit against baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti in 
federal court. 
The lawyers want the case returned to Hamilton County Common Pleas Court in 
Cincinnati, where Judge Norbert A. Nadel issued a temporary restraining order 
June 25. The order prevented Giamatti from conducting a hearing on gambling 
allegations involving the Cincinnati Reds' manager. 
The case was transferred to federal court July 5 at the request of baseball's 
lawyers. On Monday, U.S. District Judge John Holschuh of Columbus denied Rose's 
motion to return the case to the state court system. 
Rose's lawyers said they will appeal Holschuh's order next week in the 6th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. Holschuh said there was "substantial 
ground for difference of opinion" on the jurisdiction questions and allowed for 
immediate appeal. 
Baseball agreed that no action will be taken against Rose until an issue of 
jurisdiction is decided. On Monday, Holschuh extended that agreement until Aug. 
14, when he has scheduled a hearing on Rose's request for a preliminary 
injunction against Giamatti.
