FT  27 JAN 92 / International Company News: CS First Boston appointment
MR Robert Diamond, a senior executive in London for Morgan Stanley, has
joined rival US investment bank CS First Boston as chief executive of its
Far Eastern activities, writes Martin Dickson in New York.
Mr Allen Wheat, 43, who has headed the Pacific operations for the past two
years, as well as running the firm's derivatives products business, Credit
Suisse Financial Products, will now concentrate on the latter and also take
on responsibility for the bank's worldwide foreign exchange business.
Mr Wheat, who will be based in London, said both businesses had been been
growing so fast they needed separate chief executives. Mr Diamond, 40, was
previously head of fixed income securities trading for Morgan Stanley in
London.
