ABC TO DUMP 'LIVING DOLLS,' 'HOMEROOM' 
ABC will add "America's Funniest Home Videos" and "Father Dowling Mysteries" to 
its schedule, dropping "Living Dolls" and "Homeroom" and temporarily shelving 
"Mr. Belvedere," it was announced today. 
"America's Funniest Home Videos," which is just what it sounds -- a collection 
of amateur efforts from around the country -- aired as an ABC special Nov. 26 
and tied for ninth place in the Sunday ratings. 
It will become a half-hour prime-time series starting Jan. 14, 8-8:30 p.m., 
bumping the present occupant of that time period, "Free Spirit," into the 
8:30-9 p.m. slot. "Free Spirit" will dump "Homeroom," which goes off the air 
with its last scheduled broadcast Dec. 17. 
"Father Dowling Mysteries," a Fred Silverman production that last year appeared 
on NBC, will premiere Jan. 4 at 8-9 p.m. The present occupant of the time slot, 
"Mission Impossible," moves to Saturday, 8-9 p.m., as of Jan. 6. 
"Mr. Belvedere" will go on hiatus, and "Living Dolls" will go off permanently 
after Dec. 30.
