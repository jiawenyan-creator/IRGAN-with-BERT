  [Text] The Foreign Ministry handed David Sultan, the 
Israeli enemy's ambassador in Cairo, an urgent memorandum last 
week. The memorandum demanded that quick and full information 
be provided to the Egyptian authorities about the circumstances 
related to the detention of 15 Egyptians in Israeli prisons 
since approximately a year ago. The memorandum called for 
allowing Egyptian Embassy personnel in Tel Aviv to attend the 
interrogations of the detainees. 
  A Foreign Ministry source has told AL-'ARABI that seven of 
the Egyptian detainees, whom Israel has declined to name, are 
accused of spying. The eight others are alleged to have 
infiltrated into occupied Palestine without obtaining an entry 
visa. The source added: It seems that the Tel Aviv authorities 
intend to continue to hold the Egyptians in custody to bargain 
for the extradition of Israeli drug trafficker Yusuf Tahhan, who 
was sentenced to death in Egypt a few years ago, but the 
sentence has not yet been carried out.
