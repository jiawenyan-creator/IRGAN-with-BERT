FT  14 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indices offer confusing
inflation clues
BOND TRADERS who use commodity prices to predict inflation-rate changes have
had to pick their indicators carefully this year. Industrial commodity
prices have for the most part fallen, while futures prices for consumer
goods such as cereals, gold and softs have tended to rise.
At the same time, US government indices that measure price movements have
exhibited a curious tendency to follow seasonal variations - a trend belies
the Bureau of Labour Statistics' practice of adjusting prices for seasonal
factors.
If, as forecast, the BLS reports today that consumer prices were flat in
June, it will bring the consumer price index (CPI) back to a year-over-year
rate close to 3 per cent - little changed from last year.
That is good news for businesses and the US Federal Reserve Board, which aim
for price stability. However, it is a puzzle to fixed-income traders who
shorted bonds when inflation took an alarming swing upwards in the first
quarter.
Mr John Lipsky, chief economist for Salomon Brothers, says CPI data have
risen in the first four months of every year since 1989, without
consistently following through for the rest of the year.
The June CPI, if it comes in on forecast, will smooth the first quarter's
seasonal changes. 'For now, outlook for energy prices is good, demand is not
too strong, and the dollar is helpings us out overseas. That gives a pretty
steady outlook for inflation,' Mr Lipsky said.
The calm inflation forecast seems to be borne out by commodity prices. While
the Commodity Research Bureau's closely watched index of futures prices
reached 20-month highs last week, it did so on the strength of soyabean and
precious metals prices.
Those commodities carry very little weight in either the CPI or the producer
price index. A better indicator of price inflation is the CRB's index of
spot industrial commodities, heavily weighted towards scrap metals and
materials like rubber and tin.
That index, in contrast to the futures index, is near its lowest levels of
the year. A third, the Goldman Sachs commodity index, is in a similar
position.
The two indices are moving in parallel because industrial metals and energy
prices have been locked together this year. Economists say it will take an
upward turn in the broader indexes to predict a shift in inflation
expectations.
