 



UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE BOARD OF GOVERNORS



Notice of Vote to Close Meeting



At its meeting on January 3, 1994, the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service voted unanimously to close
to public observation its meeting scheduled for February 7, 1994, in Sacramento, California. The members will discuss
preparations for the rate case filing.
The meeting is expected to be attended by the following persons: Governors Alvarado, Daniels, del Junco, Dyhrkopp,
Mackie, Pace, Setrakian and Winters; Postmaster General Runyon, Deputy Postmaster General Coughlin, Secretary
to the Board Harris, and General Counsel Elcano.
The Board determined that pursuant to section 552b(c)(3) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3(c) of Title
39, Code of Federal Regulations, this portion of the meeting is exempt from the open meeting requirement of the Government
in the Sunshine Act [5 U.S.C. 552b(b)] because it is likely to disclose information in connection with proceedings
under Chapter 36 of Title 39, United States Code (having to do with postal ratemaking, mail classification and changes
in postal services), which is specifically exempted from disclosure by section 410(c)(4) of Title 39, United States
code.
The Board has determined further that pursuant to section 552b(c)(10) of Title 5, United States Code, and section
7.3(j) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the discussion is exempt because it is likely to specifically concern
participation of the Postal Service in a civil action or proceeding involving a determination on the record after
opportunity for a hearing. The Board further determined that the public interest does not require that the Board's
discussion of the matter be open to the public.
In accordance with section 552b(f)(1) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.6(a) of title 39, Code of Federal
Regulations, the General Counsel of the United States Postal Service has certified that in her opinion the meeting
may properly be closed to public observation pursuant to section 552b(c)(3) and (10) of Title 5, United States Code;
section 410(c)(4) of Title 39, United States Code; and section 7.3 (c) and (j) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations.
Requests for information about the meeting should be addressed to the Secretary of the Board, David F. Harris, at (202)
2684800.
