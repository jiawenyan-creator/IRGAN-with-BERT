FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Sun Microsystems dives 43% amid
record revenue
SUN Microsystems, the leading US manufacturer of computer workstations,
yesterday unveiled an unexpected 43 per cent drop in fourth-quarter net
income in spite of posting record revenues in the period.
Net income for the three months to June 30 was Dollars 37.7m, or 37 cents a
share, against Dollars 66.4m, or 63 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose 3
per cent to Dollars 972.7m from Dollars 942.5m last year.
On Wall Street, shares in Sun Microsystems eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 27
1/2 . The results were released after the close of trading. The company's
share price has been subject to spurts of volatility this year reflecting
some concern that Sun would not be able to live up to expectations of very
strong growth. Sun has been one of the fastest-growing companies in the
computer industry.
A number of analysts reduced their earnings projections for the company
earlier this year, but most had expected fourth quarter earnings of about 51
cents a share, with essentially flat earnings for the year.
Instead, Sun posted annual net income which slid almost 9 per cent to
Dollars 173.3m, or Dollars 1.71, compared with Dollars 190.3m, or Dollars
1.85, in fiscal 1991. Revenues advanced to Dollars 3.59bn from Dollars
3.22bn.
Operating income tumbled 51 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 49.3m from
Dollars 100.8m. For the full year, operating income was off 11 per cent to
Dollars 261.1m from Dollars 294.9m.
