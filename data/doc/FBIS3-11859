  [Text] Berend Roosen, president of the National Council of 
Commerce and Services [Consecomercio], has said this 
organization does not share the Democratic Action's position on 
the granting of special powers to President Rafael Caldera via 
the Special Powers Law. 
  [Begin Roosen recording] Given the principles that regulate 
us, we believe the Special Powers Law is inappropriate. We urge 
Congress to delegate duties and to work as it did with special 
laws when it came to aiding the banking sector. Why can't this 
be done for tax laws? [end recording] 
  Likewise, Consecomercio's representative has announced from 
13 to 16 April this organization's annual Valencia Forum will be 
held. At this forum, during which more than 500 participants 
are expected, the reestablishment of suspended economic 
guarantees will be discussed. 
  In conclusion, Roosen has said he agrees with lowering 
interest rates, because Venezuela will go from being a 
bondholder economy to a productive economy.
