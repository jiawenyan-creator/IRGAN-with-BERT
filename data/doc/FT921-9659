FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Packer unveils float plan for
magazine unit
MR KERRY Packer, the Australian media proprietor, yesterday unveiled the
public flotation of 55 per cent of his Australian Consolidated Press, the
dominant magazine publisher in the country.
The flotation, fully underwritten by Ord Minnett Securities, will raise
ADollars 475.2m (USDollars 356m) through the issue of 95.1m shares at
ADollars 5 each. Mr Packer's privately-owned Consolidated Press Holdings
will retain 45 per cent, equivalent to 77.8m shares.
The prospectus said the new vehicle would borrow an additional ADollars 350m
to provide most of the remaining cash to be paid to Mr Packer. It also
showed that the company was being floated on a price earnings multiple of
13.4 times the forecast 1992-93 net earnings of ADollars 64.5m.
The company is forecast to have earnings growth of 21.8 per cent this year
and 17.6 per cent in 1993. Dividend yield for next year is projected at 6
per cent.
The flotation of the publishing group, which owns 68 magazine titles in
Australia and New Zealand, is the latest of Mr Packer's fund-raising
exercises, which began 18 months ago. Last month, he floated 51 per cent of
Valasis Communications, his successful US-based advertising company.
