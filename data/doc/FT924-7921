FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Dividend windfall for McLeod Russel
MCLEOD RUSSEL Holdings, the paints group with interests in property and
textiles, defied recession in the year to September 30 with a 17 per cent
increase in profits thanks to cost cutting and a windfall dividend receipt.
Pre-tax profit climbed from Pounds 4.42m to Pounds 5.19m. Turnover was
static at Pounds 43.4m, but improving margins led to an increase in
operating profit to Pounds 3.64m (Pounds 3.31m).
Mr Paul Humphreys, finance director, said the group received an unexpected
Pounds 480,000 dividend from a long-standing investment in Moray Petroleum,
an oil exploration company. This was unlikely to recur in coming years.
The streamlining of the vehicle painting, wood stains, marine painting and
paint distribution operations, with the creation of a paints division, would
lead to further cost savings, he added.
Mr Humphreys said the group had net cash reserves of Pounds 10m, and was
seeking a suitable acquisition to give the business 'a third leg', possibly
in the engineering sector.
Although sales were flat, profitability at Granyte Surface Coatings, the
wood stains and lacquers offshoot, jumped 25 per cent while Kennedy
Wagstaff, the textile machinery company, moved back into the black.
Earnings per share rose to 8p (6.81p); the final dividend is raised to 3.25p
for a total of 6p (5.85p).
