FT  11 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Williamson and Assoc Nursing to improve
accounts
ASSOCIATED Nursing Services, the private nursing homes operator, and
Williamson Tea Holdings, the tea producer, have agreed to provide more
details of their accounting policies in their next sets of accounts.
The announcements follow judgments yesterday by the Financial Reporting
Review Panel, the new accounting standards watchdog.
The panel has decided to take no further action. The accounting treatments
used by the two companies in their 1991 accounts were referred to it for
consideration for possible breaches of existing UK standards.
With Associated Nursing, the panel had raised concerns over the treatment of
start-up costs and the adequacy of the explanation provided on a change of
accounting pol-icy.
In its accounts for the year to March 30, the company stated that it would
capitalise - or take on to the balance sheet rather than treat as an item of
current expenditure - the costs of building nursing homes until either three
months after they were registered or until they had achieved break-even
occupancy.
The panel said it welcomed a decision by the directors to review and report
on its start-up policies and to include a clear and finite time limit to the
capitalisation of these costs.
Williamson Tea, which is a holding company with operations in India, Kenya
and Tanzania, agreed after discussions with the panel to include fuller
information in future of its accounting policies on certain overseas assets.
These include the non-depreciation of leasehold and lease rental properties,
and why and how asset revaluations are depreciated and transferred to
reserves.
The panel's decision to take no further action in either case suggests that
the practices currently being adopted are acceptable within existing
accounting standards. Any changes to these standards need to be introduced
by its sister body, the Accounting Standards Board.
