METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-JAIL INMATE SUES SHERIFF, ALLEGES 
BEATINGS 
A black former inmate of a Saugus jail filed a civil rights lawsuit Thursday 
against the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department alleging that he was beaten 
by deputies who he said are members of a white supremacist group. 
Clydell Crawford, 26, of West Covina alleged that he was beaten and his leg 
broken on Dec. 2 while he was an inmate at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho. 
He said the six to eight deputies who allegedly beat him after removing him 
from a medium-security dormitory were members of the Wayside Whities, a large 
group of jailers who he said take their name from the jail's former name, 
Wayside Honor Rancho. 
A sheriff's spokesman declined to comment on the allegations by Crawford and 
other inmates or to comment on whether such a group exists. But he said the 
alleged beating incident was under investigation. 
The suit seeks more than $1 million in damages.
