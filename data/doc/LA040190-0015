POP EYE: STICKER THIS ITEM: 
If there was ever a record that deserved a warning label, surely it must be 
Barry White's new single, "I Wanna Do It Good to Ya." But rather than bow to 
increasing pressure from conservative family and church-group activists, 
White's label, A&amp;M Records, has made a point of spotlighting the record's 
risque contents. 
(Geez, is it possible they think some controversy might sell a few extra 
records?) At any rate, the label sent several hundred deejays and journalists a 
promotional CD of the pop heavyweight's song, complete with a gift-wrapped 
package filled with 20 condoms and a pair of crotchless lace panties. 
Apparently the censorship blues hasn't cooled local deejay libido yet -- the 
package was such a hit, A&amp;M has had to rush-order a few hundred more. 
"I wasn't in the room when our marketing and promotion folks came up with the 
idea," said an A&amp;M press spokeswoman. "But if you see the video, you'd have 
a clear understanding of our marketing strategy." And how. The clip features 
White romancing a woman with pillow talk too explicit to print in a 
mass-circulation newspaper. A&amp;M says the Black Entertainment Network is 
airing the uncensored clip while VH-1 is showing a tamer version of the clip, 
minus White's enthusiastic bedroom patter.
