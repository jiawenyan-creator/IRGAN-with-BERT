FT  18 FEB 94 / UN's Cyprus envoy hopeful as talks open
A senior United Nations envoy expressed 'modest optimism' yesterday as he
began discussions on the handover of part of the Turkish-occupied city of
Famagusta to UN control, AP reports from Nicosia. The move is intended as a
first step toward the eventual reunification of the divided island.
Mr Joe Clark, a former Canadian prime minister, conferred separately with
Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders on implementing a package of
confidence-building measures designed to break the logjam in earlier peace
talks.
Agreement on Famagusta would be followed by the opening of the disused
Nicosia International Airport for use by both communities.
