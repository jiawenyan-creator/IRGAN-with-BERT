FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Employment bill faces hurdles
THE EMPLOYMENT bill faces what could be a record number of 300 amendments as
it goes through its committee stage in the House of Lords.
The bill, which is due to become law before parliament's summer recess, has
already been the subject of dozens of mainly technical amendments at
committee and report stages in the Commons.
While most amendments have been tabled by opposition members and peers,
employers' organisations have been anxious about the burdens imposed by some
measures.
