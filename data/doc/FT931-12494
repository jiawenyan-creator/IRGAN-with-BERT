FT  28 JAN 93 / People: Pym joins top building society
Richard Pym, former head of property operations of Burton the high-street
retailers, is to be the next group finance director of the Alliance &amp;
Leicester Building Society.
A 43-year-old chartered accountant, he joined Burton from BAT in 1983. After
stints as finance director of Burton subsidiaries Top Shop and Debenhams, he
was appointed deputy finance director of the whole group in 1990. In 1991 he
was put in charge of the group's property business but lost his job little
more than a year later following a streamlining of the management structure.
He has been appointed group finance director-designate of the Alliance &amp;
Leicester, one of Britain's top three building societies, and will take over
when 59-year-old Ian Hamilton retires.
