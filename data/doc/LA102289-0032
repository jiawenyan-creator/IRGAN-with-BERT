CORPORATE MIND? 
Re Claudia Puig's Oct. 8 article, "Music to Someone's Ears": Some of the KKBT 
scenes and executives described by Puig call to mind the cold, efficient 
corporate thinking and fax-minded corporate underlings portrayed in the movie 
"Robocop." (Major chill!) 
For myself, it seems this was a good year to leave Los Angeles. Southern 
California's culture peaked with the Dodgers -- the region's last repository of 
higher culture -- winning the '88 Series. Since then, it's been all downhill.
