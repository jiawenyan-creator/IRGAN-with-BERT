  [Text] Nis, 18 Mar (TANJUG) -- "We will never agree to the 
Serb part of Sarajevo becoming part of a Muslim republic," 
Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the assembly of the Srpska 
republic, told Nis radio today. 
  "The Serbs simply have the right to Sarajevo and they will 
persist in this, while I hope that whoever wants peace has to 
understand this," Krajisnik said. "I know what the intentions of 
the other side are -- that the city should be mixed and as such 
become a part of the Muslim republic," Krajisnik said, adding 
that Sarajevo as a divided city enables the normal functioning 
of the Serb and Muslim parts, makes life easier for the 
population, and eliminates causes for fighting. 
  Krajisnik said that these are all the conditions [as 
received] and that after yesterday's signing of an agreement 
opening up blue roads in the Sarajevo area for the civilian 
population and humanitarian needs, all those advocating war will 
remain in a minority. 
  In conclusion, he said he hopes that complete peace in 
Sarajevo would be restored in the foreseeable future.
