  [Excerpt] Cairo, 16 Apr (MENA)--MENA has learned that the 
convicts sentenced in connection with the attempt against Prime 
Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi submitted appeals to reconsider their 
sentences to the military judiciary a few hours before the 
expiration of the deadline. 
  The military court issued death sentences against nine 
defendants, four of them at large; 15-year sentences at hard 
labor against three defendants; five-year sentences at hard 
labor against one defendant; and a three-year sentence against 
one defendant who is at large. One defendant, who is still at 
large, was acquitted. 
  If the court turns down these appeals, the sentences become 
final. 
  The defendants announced at the 17 March session, during 
which the sentences were issued, that they would not file any 
appeals. [passage omitted]
