  [Text] This morning a FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia] column occupied Gachala in Cundinamarca Department. 
Newswoman Chelo Garcia was at the 13th Brigade's operations 
center during preparations to counterattack the rebels. 
  [Begin Garcia recording] The counterinsurgency operations of 
the 13th Army Brigade's special forces are being coordinated at 
Huasca military base. These forces are seeking out FARC's 53 
group, which occupied Gachala a few hours ago. Official sources 
reported that the insurgents dynamited four facilities, the 
Agrarian Fund, and some banks. So far, one policeman is 
reported dead. This newswoman was unable to reach Gachala 
because, in addition to the rebels' activities, the place is 
isolated as the result of a landslide on the road leading to the 
town. Counterinsurgency reinforcements continue to be 
dispatched to the area by air. The 13th Brigade commander, 
General Norberto Agra, is coordinating operations from Santa Fe 
de Bogota. [end recording]
