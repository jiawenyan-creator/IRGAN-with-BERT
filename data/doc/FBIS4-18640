  [Excerpt] Hamburg (DPA) -- Just like Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl (Christian Democratic Union), Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping has also come out in 
favor of deporting violent Kurds. In an interview with 
LEIPZIGER VOLKSZEITUNG (Friday edition), Scharping called on the 
state to act against the activities of the Workers Party of 
Kurdistan "in a consistent and tough manner." 
  The SPD chairman said: "I would also have any Kurd deported 
to Turkey who commits act of violence here, threatens other 
people, and ignores or breaks laws" and who "is threatened 
neither with torture nor the death penalty in Turkey." However, 
one thing is impossible, Scharping said, addressing the Federal 
Government: intending to carry out radical deportations and, at 
the same time, carelessly accepting the systematic oppression of 
the Kurds by making arms deliveries or looking the other way.
