FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Annual review of FT indices
Rothmans International, Vendome Luxury Group and newly floated TeleWest
Communications are among seven companies which will be included in the FT-SE
Mid 250 index from Monday December 19 following a quarterly review of
constituents yesterday by the the FT-SE A UK Indices committee, which
oversees the FT-SE A set of UK market indices.
In a separate annual review of index constituents, the committee also
approved the inclusion of 127 new companies in the FT-SE SmallCap index,
with 81 existing companies being removed, resulting in an additional 46
companies. These changes will be made after close of business on December
30.
In the Rothmans and Vendome case, the committee had to consider the
weighting in the indices of the two companies, each of which have a complex
corporate structure, with one UK company share and one foreign company share
traded in 'stapled units'.
The two companies were formed in October last year through the
reorganisation of the tobacco and luxury goods group, but they were
initially excluded from the FT-SE indices. Dunhill, their previous
incarnation, had been included.
Last April the FT-SE A steering committee approved a new rule on the
treatment of stapled units making Rothmans and Vendome eligible for the
indices, but said the weighting of the two would be determined in December,
after publication of the two companies' audited accounts.
Yesterday the UK indices committee included Rothmans with a weighting of 30
per cent and Vendome with a weighting of 10 per cent.
