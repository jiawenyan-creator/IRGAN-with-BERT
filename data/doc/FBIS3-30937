  [Text] The fiercest enemy offensive hitherto is continuing 
in the zone of operations of the 7th South Operative Group. The 
offensive on the free territories of the Tesanj, Maglaj, Doboj, 
and Teslic communes has been going on for 25 days. The most 
difficult situation was in the zone of operations of the 203d 
Glorious Motorized Brigade of Doboj-Bosnia. After crossing the 
Usora River, the chetniks attacked Karusce, where they were 
successfully repelled as they have been on so many occasions in 
the past. Two hours later, a chetnik sabotage group was 
infiltrated in this region, but it fared in the same way as all 
the previous ones. The 110th Glorious Usora Brigade told us 
that over 500 projectiles of all calibers landed on the defense 
lines in this area overnight. 
  The enemy's forces and hardware were repositioned in the 
operational zone of the 207th and 202d brigades this morning. 
The [Serbian] aggressor is preparing an artillery and infantry 
attack.
