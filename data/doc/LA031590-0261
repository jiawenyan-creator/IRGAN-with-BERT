DESERT ORCHID DOESN'T LIVE UP TO HYPE 
Desert Orchid, the 11-year-old gray regarded as Britain's most popular 
thoroughbred, ran out of stamina today in the most-hyped race of his career and 
finished third in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. 
Norton's Coin, a 100-1 long shot, won the steeplechase, the longest-priced 
winner in the 66-year history of the event, second only to the Grand National 
in prestige. 
Toby Tobias, an 8-1 shot, was second, three-quarters of a length behind the 
winner. Desert Orchid and jockey Richard Dunwoody were four lengths farther 
back. Nine other horses started. 
Off at 10-11 odds, Desert Orchid was the hottest Gold Cup favorite in 15 years 
as he attempted to become only the sixth horse to win the 3 1/4-mile race 
twice.
