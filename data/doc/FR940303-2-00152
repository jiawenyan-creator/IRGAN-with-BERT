 

According to the NYSE, however, the efficiencies sought to be obtained by eliminating the differential charge on
odd-lot limit orders would only be achieved if the odd-lot system was used in a manner consistent with traditional
odd-lot investing practices of smaller investors rather than as a professional trading vehicle.

The Exchange has identified and informed its members about several practices that it believes are not consistent
with traditional odd-lot investing practices and whose use constitutes an abuse of the odd-lot system. These practices
include unbundling of round-lots for the purpose of entering odd-lot limit orders; failure to aggregate odd-lot
orders into round lots; entry of both buy and sell odd-lot limit orders for purposes of capturing the spread in the stock;
and order entry practices intended to circumvent the round-lot auction market.

See NYSE Information memo No. 9129, July 25, 1991. See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31048 (August
18, 1992), 57 FR 38706 (August 26, 1992), Odd-lot limit orders are executed upon the occurrence of the first round-lot
transaction in the security, which is at or better than the specified limit, following receipt of the order by the odd-lot
system. See NYSE Rule 124.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Exchange's proposal identifies additional types of odd-lot limit order trading which the Exchange believes
are not consistent with traditional odd-lot investment activity and should not be permitted to use the odd-lot limit
order service. Specifically, the proposal would preclude the use of the odd-lot limit order service,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 for (1) index arbitrage, (2) other types of program trading,
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 or (3) any pattern of activity that would suggest day trading. Examples of this latter practice could include among
other things, entering multiple off-lot limit orders to buy and sell the same security on the same day or odd-lot limit
orders to buy and sell a group of stocks on the same day where it appears or is established that the intent is to capture
the spread in these stocks by buying on the bid and selling on the offer.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Upon approval of this proposed rule change, the Exchange intends to advise its members and member organizations,
through an Information Memo, that these types of trading practices may not be effectuated by means of the odd-lot limit
order service.

Such trading would not be precluded from using the odd-lot system if odd-lot market orders were utilized. Also, such
prohibitions do not extend to PRLs (part of round lots) because they are executed outside of the odd-lot system.

</FOOTNAME>
The Exchange does permit odd-lot limit orders to be entered in conjunction with a program trade where such orders consist
in the aggregate of a relatively small part of the overall program. The term program trading is defined in NYSE Rule
80A as either index arbitrage or any trading strategy involving the related purchase or sale of a group or basket of
15 or more publicly traded securities that have a total fair market value of $1,000,000 or more.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
The Exchange does recognize, however, that some types of buying and selling on the same day may be appropriate and cites
as an example buying stock using an odd-lot limit order and subsequently entering a stop loss sell order against that
position.

</FOOTNOTE>


In its filing the NYSE stated that the limitations on use of the odd-lot limit order system are intended to address specific
types of trading activity, and are not intended to limit access to, or use of, the system by individual market participants
or any class of market participants for any authorized use of the system.

Under the proposal member organizations will be expected to establish appropriate systems to monitor odd-lot activity
to ensure that the practices noted in the Information Memo are not engaged in. The Information Memo makes clear that
the Exchange intends to initiate appropriate regulatory action if it finds that member organizations have permitted
such trading practices, either for proprietary accounts or for the accounts of customers.



III. Discussion



The NYSE's odd-lot order execution system is intended to provide efficient execution of odd-lot orders at the best
prices available.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission agrees with the NYSE that the odd-lot limit order trading practices identified in the proposed Information
Memo are not consistent with traditional odd-lot limit order investing practices. Such practices could undermine
the integrity of the system and contravene the odd-lot order system's purposes.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
See, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28837 (January 29, 1991), 56 FR 5660 (February 5, 1991).

</FOOTNOTE>


In this context, the Commission notes that the NYSE's odd-lot order trading system is predicated on the specialists'
willingness to provide execution and price guarantees to odd-lot orders, the majority of which are entered for smaller
retail accounts. These transactions are too small to be handled efficiently through the regular Exchange auction
process. These orders generally are used by retail investors to buy or sell a small amount of stock and are not used in
short term trading strategies. As a result, Exchange specialists are able to provide execution guarantees to odd-lot
limit orders without charging an additional handling fee. The use of the system as a day trading vehicle or as part of
program trades to capture the bid ask spread through odd-lot limit orders could reduce specialists' willingness
to provide cost-efficient executions of odd-lot limit orders. Accordingly, it is reasonable for the NYSE to preclude
use of its odd-lot limit order system for index arbitrage, program trading, and day trading. Ensuring the odd-lot
limit order system is only utilized for the types of orders it was intended to accommodate will help to ensure the continued
economic liability of the system which should ultimately benefit all investors consistent with section 6(b)(5)
of the Act.
