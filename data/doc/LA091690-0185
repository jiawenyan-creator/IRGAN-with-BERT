BARBARIKA WINS TURFWAY PARK FEATURE 
Barbarika took the lead coming out of the gate and held off a challenge from 
Colonial Waters to win the third running of the $183,100 Grade III Budweiser 
Breeders' Cup by a neck Saturday at Turfway Park. 
The 5-year-old mare, with Aaron Gryder aboard, held a small advantage over a 
field of 10 competitors from wire to wire, covering the 1 1-16-mile test for 
fillies and mares in 1:44. 
Colonial Waters, ridden by Jim Bruin, advanced on the outside on the run down 
the backside and sailed three horses wide in the stretch turn to create a 
threat to Barbarika with a quarter mile left to race.
