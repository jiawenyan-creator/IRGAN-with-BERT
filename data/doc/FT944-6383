FT  30 NOV 94 / Palestinians get World Bank loan
The World Bank has agreed to extend a Dollars 58m credit to Palestinian
authorities to support self-rule projects, an official at the multinational
institution said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
The deal will be signed in Brussels today by Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO
chairman. Mr Arafat and Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said
they would put pressure on donors, who are to begin a two-day meeting today,
to pay out urgently money already promised to the Palestinians. The donors'
last meeting broke down in a row over the Palestinians' inclusion of
Jerusalem in projects to be backed.
In October last year, aid donors pledged more than Dollars 2bn over five
years for projects to support Palestinian self-rule, with Dollars 700m to be
paid out this year. Only about Dollars 60m had so far been received.
