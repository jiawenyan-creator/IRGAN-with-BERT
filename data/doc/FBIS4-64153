  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 28/5/1994 -- Immediately after 
the explosion of a bomb in Boris Luchik's apartment he and one 
of his bodyguards were hospitalized at the Centre of Burns from 
Odessa. In the attempt Luchik received burns covering 60 
percent of his body, his bodyguard 75 percent. Boris Luchik's 
wife, Valentina died just after the explosion. 
  Tiraspol officials gave the opinion on the local radio that 
the attempt on prosecutor's life was advantageous for Colonel 
Bergman, commander of the military division, who was earlier 
under investigation. The commander of the 14th Army declared 
that the attempt was probably organized by Vadim Shevtsov 
(Antyufeyev), as the Dniester prosecutor had authorized the 
arrest of Limanskiy, ex-deputy chairman of the Slobozia District 
Soviet.
