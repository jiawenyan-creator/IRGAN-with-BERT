GREAT INVENTIONS/GOOD INTENTIONS: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF AMERICAN PATENT 
DESIGNS BY ERIC BAKER, TEXT BY JANE MARTIN (CHRONICLE: 16.95). 
Although highly entertaining, "Great Inventions" is just a portfolio of patent 
drawings from the '30s and '40s, rather than a history of design. 
The influence of Modernism can be seen in the emphasis on streamlining and the 
illusion of speed in these drawings: Even the ashtrays have had their corners 
smoothed away until they resemble sleek dirigibles. A surprising number of 
these drawings look like something else: A radio becomes a miniature grand 
piano, and a hilarious design for an Americana restaurant combines a log cabin 
with a covered wagon. Only a few of these projects were ever realized -- and no 
wonder. Charles Solomon
