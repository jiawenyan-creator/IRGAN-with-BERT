FT  18 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alcoa says avoid rivals
Employees of Aluminium Company of America, the world's biggest aluminium
group, have been told to stay away from meetings where competitors are
likely to be present.
Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman, made this edict following the recent decision by
the US Justice Department to investigate whether US aluminium producers
broke antitrust laws when they cut production after government
representatives from some of the major aluminium-producing regions signed an
unprecedented Memorandum of Understanding in February.
Alcoa insisted that Mr O'Neill's instruction did not arise from any
heightened concern about the antitrust inquiry. Mr O'Neill said in his note
to senior managers he was sure no employee had engaged in any improper
conduct. Nevertheless: 'It is prudent to take into account the possibility
of changing standards of enforcement and compliance by governmental agencies
as administrations change. As a responsible company we want to assure the
reduction of any risks arising from misunderstandings regarding contacts
with competitors.' In future, employees would need explicit permission to
attend any meeting where rival companies would be represented.
However, Alcoa has told the US Aluminium Association and the International
Primary Aluminium Institute it will continue to supply them with statistics.
The Justice Department investigation surprised the industry because three
department lawyers were present to advise on the memorandum. Alcan of Canada
and the European Aluminium Association have also been asked to co-operate in
the department's inquiry.
