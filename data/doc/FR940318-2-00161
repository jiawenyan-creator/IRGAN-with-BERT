<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations was established in accordance with the Federal Advisory
Committee Act (FACA) Public Law 92463. Pursuant to section 10(a) of FACA, this is to announce that the Commission
will meet at the time and place shown below.




</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
TIME AND PLACE: 

The meeting will be held on Wednesday, April 6, 1994 from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in room N3437 AD, U.S. Department
of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.



AGENDA: 

In the face of increasing public regulation of the workplace, and in view of the level of conflict, the meeting will
be concerned with the extent to which workplace problems can be directly resolved by the parties themselves, or through
alternative dispute resolution methods, rather than through recourse to litigation and regulatory bodies.





The morning panel will be comprised of representatives from management and labor and from civil rights and civil liberty
organizations.


The afternoon session will be comprised of academics concerned with alternative dispute resolution of private disputes
and those under public recognition.





A period has been reserved between the two panels for a presentation on pay equity concerns of women's organizations.




The members of the panels will each be allotted ten minutes of prepared presentations and then engage in discussion
of the issues with each other and with members of the Commission.





Public Participation




The meeting will be open to the public. It will be in session from 9:30 a.m. until 12 noon when it will adjourn for lunch
and will return at 1:30 p.m. Seating will be available to the public on a first-come, first-served basis. Handicapped
individuals wishing to attend should contact the Commission to obtain appropriate accommodations. Individuals
or organizations wishing to submit written statements should send 15 copies to Mrs. June M. Robinson, Designated
Federal Official, Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution
