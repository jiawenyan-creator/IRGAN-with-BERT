Council for the Protection of Rural England (071-976-6433), a watchdog,
highly effective for its quiet handling of government departments.

Counterparts are CCW and SNH: see under EN.
Countryside Stewardship - a CC scheme to encourage public use of seven
typical English landscapes: chalk downs; lowland heath; river valleys;
coasts; uplands; historic landscapes (a deer park was the first) and old
meadow. One year old and an unexpected 900 agreements signed. It must
protect existing field walls, hedges and trees. Grants from Pounds 20 to
Pounds 100 an acre. More for public access, or school use, or new footpaths
(10p a metre) or footpaths for the disabled (20p). A similar scheme in
Wales, Tir Cymen, began in July but is restricted at present.

English division of the Nature Conservancy Council. Its counterparts are CCW
(Countryside Council for Wales) in Bangor (0248-370444) and SNH (Scottish
Natural Heritage, 031-447-4784).
ESA - Environmentally Sensitive Area. By 1993 there will be 31 ESAs, run by
MAFF: fine but fragile country from the Lake District to the Suffolk River
Valleys. Grants up to Pounds 120 an acre, with extra payments for, say,
clearing scrub on the South Downs or rebuilding dry stone walls in the
Dales. Payments, in 1991 totalling Pounds 8.2m for 3,100 schemes, are
expected to reach Pounds 45m in England in 1994/95. The EC pays about 10 per
cent of the cost.
F&amp;CGS - the Farm and Conservation Grant Scheme gives 15 to 40 per cent
grants for capital expenditure of environmental value, such as shelter
belts, field boundaries, bracken control and heather management (good for
grouse).
Farm Diversification Grant Scheme - 25 per cent capital grants for
non-agricultural work on the farm, such as a shop with car park.
FWPS - the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme, run by FC and DAFS/MAFF/WOAD to
encourage planting of broadleaved woods on productive farm land, replaced
the Farm Woodland Scheme on April 1. Planting grants up to Pounds 630 an

broadleaves.
FC - Forestry Commission, based in Edinburgh (031-334-0303) and charged
since 1919 with promoting native forestry, so that we should not be
dependent on foreign wood in times of war. Though it has introduced
non-native species such as the sitka spruce that blights the Borders, it now
emphasises deciduous trees.
Hedgerow Scheme - launched in July by the DOE with CC and MAFF, with funding
of Pounds 3.5m over the next three years.
Landscape Conservation Grants - small grants from CC and CCW for small
schemes for planting trees and woods, cleaning ponds, etc.

(Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland) and WOAD (Welsh
Office Agriculture Department).
NSA - Nitrate Sensitive Area. Following an EC directive, a pilot MAFF scheme
to control nitrates leaching from the earth, mainly by cutting fertiliser
application. The aim is to improve drinking water. Th UK will need some
normal wet years to see if it is succeeding.
Project Grants - discretionary grants from EN and CCW for anything that
helps nature conservation. Equipment, seasonal labour and display boards may
all be covered.
SSSI - Site of Special Scientific Interest. Run by EN etc. SSSIs in England
now total 3,675, covering 6 per cent of the country's area. Most are special
habitats for the rarer plants, birds and animals; some are chosen for their
geology. Typical is a rare wild sage habitat in Oxfordshire (Pounds 59 an
acre). Locations little publicised. Linked is the pilot Wildlife Enhancement
Scheme (Pounds 20 to Pounds 30 an acre).
Set-Aside - this EC scheme reached the UK in 1988. Many farmers curse it as
it makes land idle. Up to Pounds 90 an acre for removing land from
production for five years. Related is the Countryside Premium Scheme in East
Anglia including Herts and Northants - inquire from the CC in Cambridge
(0223-354462) - with extra payments up to Pounds 80 an acre for schemes that
benefit wildlife, landscape and community use of the countryside. Higher
payments for combining Set-Aside with FWPS or WGS.
WGS - Woodland Grant Scheme, introduced in 1988 when the tax concession on
forestry were repealed, pays planting grants. The best are for small stands
(one to two acres) of broadleaves: Pounds 600 an acre. Grants may also be
available from the Rural Development Commission for refurbishing traditional
farm buldings, or English Heritage for management agreements to protect SAMs
(Scheduled Ancient Monuments), or local councils. AONBs (Areas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty) and National Parks also have schemes.
