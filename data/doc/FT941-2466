FT  21 MAR 94 / Property price rise forecast
Commercial property values could rise 7.5 per cent a year in the next 10
years, says a report by Charterhouse, the merchant bank.
It says that the next two years are likely to see an upturn in property
development as a result of property value growth and a revival in banks'
willingness to lend.
The fluctuations in the next property cycle are likely to be modest,
however. 'There are heavy odds against a repeat of the great UK credit
explosions and property booms and busts of the early 1970s and 1980s,' it
says.
The report's forecast of rising commercial property values is based on the
assumption of low inflation and falling property yields. It says that
commercial rents are unlikely to rise by more than inflation, as demand is
held back by changes in working patterns.
The report forecasts that the workforce may rise by up to 1m in the decade,
as the growth in part-time work exceeds the fall in full-time work. But the
number of workplaces needed is likely to decline, as a result of more
self-employed people working from home and a trend to more people sharing
desks. This will be partly offset by a trend for office workers to use more
space per person.
The sharp fall in property building since 1990 has left scope for an
expansion in construction. Industrial building would need to grow by 3 per
cent to 4 per cent a year through the next decade to return to the long-term
trend and office and shop building by 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent.
