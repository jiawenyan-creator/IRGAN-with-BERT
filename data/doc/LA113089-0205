BRIEFCASE: RETAIL 
Yes, They May: May Co. has announced plans to open a three-level 
150,000-square-foot department store at MainPlace/Santa Ana by spring, 1991. 
The store -- which will be the fourth anchor for the Santa Ana mall -- will not 
be a replacement for the 140,000-square-foot May Co. store at the City mall in 
nearby Orange. "At this time, we plan to keep (that) May Co. open," said Ed 
Mangiafico, chairman of the May Co. Southern California division. 
MainPlace will also be adding between 20 and 30 smaller retail shops, for a 
total of about 35,000 square feet.
