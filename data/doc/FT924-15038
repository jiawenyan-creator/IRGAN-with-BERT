FT  07 OCT 92 / Protests against withdrawal of Yugoslav navy from Prevlaka
Hundreds of Serbs and Montenegrins yesterday protested against the
withdrawal of the Yugoslav navy from Prevlaka, Croatia's southern Adriatic
peninsula, agreed by the presidents of Croatia and the rump Yugoslavia in
Geneva last week, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade.
Prevlaka is due to become a demilitarised zone. The UN Security Council was
due last night to adopt a resolution empowering UN soldiers to monitor it
and to ensure the removal of heavy weapons from neighbouring areas of
Croatia and Montenegro, in co-operation, as appropriate, with EC monitors.
The protesters said the withdrawal would pave the way for a Croatian
offensive on Serb-held regions in neighbouring southern Bosnia and in
Montenegro, which with Serbia makes up the unrecognised Yugoslav federation.
The protest appeared to be backed by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
