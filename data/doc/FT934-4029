FT  06 DEC 93 / International Company News: ANZ wins Dollars 650m mandate
for India loans
ANZ, the Australian banking group, has won the mandate to arrange loans of
up to Dollars 650m to help finance three large power projects in India.
Rolls-Royce, the British engineering group, last month won contracts
amounting to Pounds 660m (Dollars 983.4m) to build three power plants in
India. These include a coal-fired station in West Bengal, a similar station
in the state of Bihar, and a combined cycle gas fired station in Andhra
Pradesh.
ANZ International Merchant Banking will arrange up to Dollars 650m of
dollar-denominated offshore debt and equity, including funding from export
credit agencies, from multilateral financial institutions, such as the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), and from the commercial banking sector with a
syndication loan.
The remaining finance will probably be raised using a combination of equity
and loans from Indian credit institutions, according to ANZ.
