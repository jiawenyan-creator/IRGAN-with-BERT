SUMMER JOBS FOR YOUTH AT DISNEYLAND 
With reference to your essay (June 4) on summer work at Disneyland, Bob Secter 
enumerates the dress code and other regulations given by Disneyland to its 
prospective employees. He sarcastically and judgmentally denigrates youths of 
today as if young men with earrings are the norm. 
What he fails to discuss is the scholar-athletes and student leaders that are 
more the norm of today's youth. They are even recognized in the same newspaper 
as his article (see Sports and the outstanding student citizen section). 
He also fails to mention that the general admission price of entrance to this 
park is $23.50. Anyone who is paid as little as $4.75 to $5 an hour couldn't 
even afford to get in.
