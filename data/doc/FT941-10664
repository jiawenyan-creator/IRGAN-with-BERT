FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: S&amp;P warns Japanese banks over
bad loan write-offs
Until Japanese banks come to terms with their asset quality problems, the
country's stock markets will not show a sustainable recovery, warned
Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit rating agency, in a report
released yesterday on the banks' approach on writing off bad loans.
Compared with their US and Australian counterparts, Japanese banks have been
slow in writing off problem loans due to a lack of tax incentives. Although
the agency says the acceleration of write-offs would not affect ratings, it
warned that the difficulty in assessing the ultimate loss of the gradual
write-off procedure would affect investor confidence.
The mounting speculation about the actual size of the bad debt burden of
Japanese banks has added to the scepticism, which has weighed down on the
banks' share prices. They will find themselves in a vicious circle since a
weak stock market limits their ability to rely on hidden reserves to help
absorb losses stemming from clearing their balance sheets of problem loans.
But an acceleration of the write-off process by banks will be welcomed by
stock market investors, supporting share prices and lifting the operating
flexibility of the banks. This will in turn improve the overall business
climate while allowing banks to spend less management time on resolving past
mistakes.
Hyogo Bank, which is based in western Japan, announced a 10-year rescue plan
for its troubled 10 affiliated non-bank financial companies.
Hyogo, itself undergoing financial restructuring, will waive interest
payments by the affiliates, increasing its burden by Y7.2bn to Y11.7bn
(Dollars 108m). By raising its own commitment, the bank wants to persuade
other creditors of the 10 financial affiliates, including life assurers and
banks, to cut interest rates on loans to 2 per cent, relieving the
affiliates' interest payments by Y37bn.
