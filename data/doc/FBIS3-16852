  [Text] This morning the Russian premier met with Tsutomu 
Hata, the Japanese minister of foreign affairs. Participants in 
the meeting said that possible projects for economic cooperation 
were the main topic discussed at the talks. In addition, 
political aspects of Russian-Japanese relations were discussed. 
This is what Viktor Chernomyrdin said in response to a question 
about the Northern Territories and what Tsutomu Hata replied to 
a question about the possibility of Russia joining the G-7. 
  [Begin recording] [Chernomyrdin] We did not discuss this 
matter in detail but we did touch on it in principle: that we 
need to conclude a peace treaty between Russia and Japan and 
that, naturally, the issue relating to the territories is one 
that we will study. So, we will be acting without haste on 
this. This issue cannot be settled hurriedly. There is an 
accord reached following the president's visit. I believe we 
will continue to act in future within the framework of this 
understanding. 
  [Hata in Japanese, with superimposed Russian translation] 
Regarding the issue of Russia joining the G-7, this issue should 
be examined within the framework of the G-7 countries. Since we 
know that Russia plays a very important role in the political 
life of the international community, including in the issue of 
the former Yugoslavia, I think we should therefore continue in 
future to have close contacts with Russia. But if one is to 
talk categorically about this issue, then ultimately it is 
Italy's turn this year to be the country which chairs the G-7. 
So, it is Italy that can play the chief role in deciding this 
matter. But, nevertheless, bearing in mind the major role which 
Russia plays in the international community, I think we should 
have close contacts in future with Russia on this matter. [end
