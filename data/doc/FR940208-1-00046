 

The initial equations were simplified to match the desired approach to provide a simple and reasonable set of equations
to distinguish between area and major sources. The initial equations were simplified and narrowed through testing
the equations against different model facility parameters and assumptions. Consequently, the original equations
were reduced to a limited number of equipment parameter variables and reduced to one equation for bulk terminals and
another for pipeline breakout stations. The resulting equations presented below are determined by the Agency to
capture all major sources under the realistic mix of facility equipment and operating parameters.

The Agency provides the above equations to simplify and reduce the implementation burden to affected and non-affected
facilities. The Agency requests public comments on the utility, accuracy, and need for these equations. 


2. Determination of Floor Control Levels 


A boundary in the formulation of the regulatory alternatives is a determination of the MACT floor for new and existing
sources. The statutory requirements for determining these floors was previously discussed in section V.D of this
preamble. Selection of floor levels of control using the statutory criteria is described in the following subsections.

a. 

Loading racks. 

In many of the areas where bulk terminal loading rack controls are mandated authorities have imposed control requirements
more stringent than the limit of 80 mg TOC per liter of gasoline loaded recommended in the CTG for bulk gasoline terminals.
A summary of State regulations pertaining to gasoline tank truck loading indicated that some terminals currently
are operating under a 10 mg TOC per liter limitation in parts of California. In addition, the NSPS for tank truck loading
at bulk gasoline terminals (subpart XX of 40 CFR part 60) limits emissions to 35 mg/liter. There are currently three
types of vapor processor systems, refrigeration condensers, carbon adsorbers, and thermal oxidation systems,
used to meet these three control requirement emission limits. Each type of control can be specifically designed to
meet each limit. 
To establish the control requirements for new sources the Agency is required to select controls not less stringent
(floor) than the control achieved in practice by the best similar source. The best performing control systems at similar
sources, or systems achieving the maximum degree of reduction in emissions, are those systems designed and operated
to meet the 10 mg TOC per liter standard. Therefore, control systems achieving the 10 mg TOC per liter limit are considered
the floor control level for new sources.
