  [Text] Varna, April 11 (BTA) -- We were hoping that Russian 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would visit Bulgaria in 
March-April but apparently the visit will take place later as it 
is related to the drafting of intergovernmental documents on 
further cooperation between Bulgaria and Russia, Russian 
Ambassador to Bulgaria Aleksandr Avdeyev said at a press 
conference here tonight. 
  One of the documents refers to debt settlement and is being 
drafted by financial experts of the two countries, the second 
regulates payments between the two countries in the national 
currencies. There are also several other documents on 
cooperation in nuclear power engineering, in conventional power 
engineering, in agriculture and health care. 
  Ambassador Avdeyev informed journalists of joint projects he 
discussed during his three-day visit to Varna: on Russian 
investment in tourism, on a Bulgarian-Russian ferryboat link and 
on restoring direct contacts between enterprises of the two 
countries.
