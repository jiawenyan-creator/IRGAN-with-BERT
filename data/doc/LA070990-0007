IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
STUDY LINKS DEPRESSION TO FATIGUE SYNDROME 
Depression may be the primary cause of debilitating chronic fatigue syndrome, 
the so-called "yuppie flu," and not a common virus, scientists reported last 
week in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
University of Washington researchers said comparisons of 26 people who suffered 
from chronic fatigue and 18 others with no medical complaints turned up no 
evidence the syndrome is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), as some past 
studies had suggested. 
EBV, which causes mononucleosis, had been suspected of causing chronic fatigue 
because many victims of the disease showed signs of being infected with it. 
The primary symptom is long-term lethargy that leaves victims unable to 
function normally and often, unable to work. 
The new study revealed that those with chronic fatigue had "a strikingly higher 
rate of lifetime and current major depression than controls." Thirteen of the 
chronic fatigue sufferers had experienced at least one episode of major 
depression before the onset of their illnesses.
