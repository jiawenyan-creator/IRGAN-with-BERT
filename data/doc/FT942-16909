FT  07 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slightly firmer after
calmer session
Wall Street
US share prices finished mixed yesterday as orderliness returned to the
equity markets after a string of routs and Tuesday's powerful recovery,
writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 4.32 firmer at 3,679.73, while
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.24 off at 448.05. The Nasdaq composite shed
only 0.23 at 750.72 after retracing most of its lost ground during the
afternoon. New York SE volume was 302m shares.
After the previous day's 82-point surge by the Dow - its biggest gain since
December 23, 1991 - investors appeared uncertain about the market's next
step. Most analysts were convinced that Tuesday's surge was only a pause in
a long term retreat triggered by February's shift to a tighter monetary
policy.
As a result, the morning's activity was directionless. The blue chips nosed
in and out of positive territory, and smaller-capitalisation stocks showed
weakness as profit-takers capitalised on Tuesday's powerful advance on the
Nasdaq.
A measure of urgency returned at midday as the price of the benchmark
30-year government bond, which had been showing a slim loss during most of
the morning, lurched downwards. Stocks quickly fell in line with the bond
action, but share prices stabilised before another broad sell-off could
develop. Later in the afternoon, the long bond trimmed its loss, allowing
blue chip stocks to reverse course and move modestly higher.
The day's only economic input was news of the March performances by US motor
vehicle manufacturers. Total sales came in at an annual rate of 7.5m
vehicles, suggesting the sector was holding on to its newfound vigour.
General Motors, a Dow industrial component, gained Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars
59. The stock received an additional boost from a 'strong buy'
recommendation by JP Morgan. Chrysler firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 54 7/8
and Ford Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 60 7/8 , as their sales data were in line
with expectations.
Caterpillar resumed its leadership of the blue chips, surging Dollars 3 7/8
to Dollars 120 1/8 . JP Morgan advanced Dollars 2 to Dollars 62 1/2 .
Notable losers included United Technologies, down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars
64 3/8 , and General Electric, off Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 97 5/8 . Near
the close, GE said its first-quarter earnings would come in at the high end
of estimates. The announcement helped the stock trim its loss on the day.
Promus, a hotel and casino operator, fell Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 37 1/2 on
heavy volume of 2.1m shares. The plunge came on news that voters in Missouri
had rejected a proposal to allow slot machines in riverboat casinos.
Canada
Toronto closed solidly higher in moderate trading after the market continued
to recover from its recent tumble.
The TSE 300 composite index added 40 points at 4,313.3 and advances
outnumbered falls by 515 to 291 after volume of 69.7m shares valued at
CDollars 755m.
The rise adds to Tuesday's 43-point gain, which came on the strength of
rallying bond prices and a steadier Canadian dollar.
Mexico
Equities fell sharply in early trading in reaction to an increase in
domestic interest rates, but later rebounded to leave the IPC index a net
26.37, or 1.18 per cent, up at 2,260.52.
The interest rate on the 28-day treasury bill, or Cetes, was lifted by 2.68
percentage points to 14.31 per cent in the central bank's weekly auction,
its highest level since late 1993.
South Africa was closed yesterday for a public holiday.
