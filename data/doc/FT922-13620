FT  10 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
THE PLATINUM price fell to the lowest level for 11 weeks yesterday after
another bout of Japanese selling. At the London bullion market's afternoon
fixing the it was Dollars 345.20 a troy ounce, down Dollars 4.05 on the day
and Dollars 10.55 on the week so far. Traders believed Japanese operators
had again sold platinum to raise funds to cover equity losses. Other
precious metals were little changed. At the London Metal Exchange the cash
COPPER price reversed an early fall to close Pounds 6.25 higher at Pounds
1,270.75 a tonne. Dealers said the fall had bounced off support at the
equivalent of Dollars 2,230 a tonne and the subsequent gain was encouraged
by expectations that a further fall in LME stocks would be announced today.
But ALUMINIUM stocks were expected to rise to a fresh record and the cash
price closed Dollars 6.25 down at Dollars 1,323.75 a tonne. The prospect of
a further stocks increase also weighed on the NICKEL market. The uptrend in
TIN prices was maintained as concern continued at the lack of quality metal
available for nearby delivery. The cash price closed at Dollars 5,812.50 a
tonne, up Dollars 40 on the day.
