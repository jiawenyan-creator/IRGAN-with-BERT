  [Text] Lvov, 15 Jan -- The tripartite treaty on the 
elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which has been signed 
in Moscow, will make it possible to deepen cooperation between 
Ukraine and other states and will meet with the understanding 
and support of the world community. This view was expressed 
today by the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Konstantin Zlenko [name 
as received], Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, and Deputy 
Prime Minister Vasiliy Shmarov at a meeting with representatives 
of the diplomatic corps. 
  At the same time Ukrainian centrist and radical right-wing 
political parties showed a total lack of understanding of the 
signing of the treaty. In particular, the very large Rukh 
organization and the Conservative Republican Party assessed the 
actions taken by President Kravchuk as treachery. According to 
them, the document signed in Moscow covers not only liquid 
fuelled rockets but also solid fuelled ones, which are not even 
mentioned in the START I Treaty. 
  The pointer of the political barometer in Ukraine has moved 
toward tension. The sharp response has been softened to a 
certain extent by the Christmas holidays, which continue until 
19 January.
