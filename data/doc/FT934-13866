FT  20 OCT 93 / World Trade News: French reassured
A GATT accord would help France promote its service sector, protect its
patents and, in the fraught agricultural area, push its processed food
exports, Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the world trade body, said
yesterday, writes David Buchan in Paris.
In a powerful speech to a business conference in Paris, he underlined
France's self-interest in a rapid conclusion to the Uruguay Round
negotiations. Mr Sutherland also warned that a failure of Gatt talks would
not halt adjustments in the world economy, but simply ensure that 'the law
of the jungle will prevail'.
The Gatt chief praised Prime Minister Edouard Balladur for launching his
country into a national debate on the world trade talks' outcome. France and
other European countries, he said, faced a choice between 'thriving in an
open global economy with effective and fair rules. . . or stifling to death
in an over-protected EC'.
Mr Sutherland rejected the widespread notion in France that the December 15
deadline for Gatt negotiators to finish their work was an 'American' date,
pointing out that it also had EC acceptance. He noted a Gatt deal would help
suppress counterfeiting of French luxury goods and protect the patents of
high-tech industry.
