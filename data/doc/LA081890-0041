A STRAIT PROTEST 
I demand that The Times find someone to review country music who knows what 
he/she is doing. 
I attended the George Strait concert and I'm very disappointed with Robert 
Hilburn's Aug. 14 potshots at a singer just named country entertainer of the 
year! 
I am not a barefoot country bumpkin. I am a professional in Beverly Hills who 
grew up in L.A. There are a lot of us who appreciate the values, morals and 
smooth presentation of country music.
