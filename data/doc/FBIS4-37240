  [Text] In a telephone contact with MBC a short time ago, 
'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, the second-ranking man in Sanaa, set 
Sanaa's conditions for holding a dialogue with the southern 
Yemenis. He stressed that this dialogue will not be held 
outside the framework of the tripartite coalition that ruled 
Yemen before the war. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-'Ansi] We have, in fact, expressed our 
willingness to go to Cairo, on condition that the meeting 
involves the ruling tripartite coalition in the Republic of 
Yemen and that it will not be a meeting between two governments 
or parties. If this condition for the meeting is met, then we 
will agree to it; but if it is to be held on the basis of talks 
between the so-called secessionist government and the legitimate 
one, then we reject it. 
  [Ahmad Manjunah] Mr. al-'Ansi, have you told UN envoy 
Lakhdar 
Ibrahimi with this position? 
  [Al-'Ansi] He will be informed of this appropriate reply if 
the consultations continue. [end recording]
