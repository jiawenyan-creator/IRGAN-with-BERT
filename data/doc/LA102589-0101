ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH 
TELEVANGELISTS -- Orange County names abound in the just-published "Forgiven: 
The Rise and Fall of Jim Bakker and the PTL Ministry," by Charles E. Shepard, 
Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the Charlotte Observer. . . . Among them is 
Paul Crouch, who with Bakker founded Trinity Broadcasting Network in Tustin in 
1973. . . . Things got so acrimonious before the televangelists' final split, 
Shepard writes, that Bakker prepared to fight an on-air coup by Crouch, 
suggesting an associate be "poised to kill the audio and fade to black . . . if 
Crouch tried anything." (A1) Dana Parsons and Rick VanderKnyff
