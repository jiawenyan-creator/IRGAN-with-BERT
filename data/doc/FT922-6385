FT  23 MAY 92 / Economy 'on the turn' says CBI: Company liquidations fall
THE UK economy is 'on the turn', the Confederation of British Industry said
yesterday. Although official figures showed the recession continuing into
the first quarter of this year, the CBI's industrial trends survey for May
and its latest economic forecast pointed to better times.
The CBI found that many manufacturers had experienced a marked improvement
in home and export orders in recent weeks, raising expectations of higher
output over the next four months.
However, the CBI's own economists expect only modest economic expansion of
0.9 per cent this year after last year's 2.4 per cent decline in output. The
CBI forecasters, who have revised down their expectations of 1992 growth
from 1.7 per cent last November, expect the economy to gather momentum over
the year and grow by 2.9 per cent next year.
The CBI found in this month's survey that total order books, although still
well below normal, were at their best levels since August 1990, when Iraq
invaded Kuwait. It found that export order books were at levels last seen in
October 1990.
Over the next four months, 31 per cent of companies expect to increase their
output volume and only 18 per cent predict a decline. The balance, which
indicates the trend, was plus 13 per cent this month. It was the highest
figure since July 1989 and compared with plus 5 per cent in April this year
and a negative balance of 18 per cent in May last year.
The CBI surveyed 1,277 companies in 50 industries between April 28 and May
13. The companies are responsible for about half of British manufacturing
employment and exports.
It found that stocks were run down in May, with a balance of only 13 per
cent of companies - the lowest balance since September 1990 - saying stocks
were more than adequate to meet expected demand.
Mr Sudhir Junakar and Professor Douglas McWilliams, CBI economists, believe
that an end to destocking should play a leading part in bringing about an
economic upturn this year. They expect that a Pounds 3bn turnround in the
stock cycle will contribute some 0.7 percentage points of the 1.6 per cent
increase in domestic demand now expected for this year.
Other factors stimulating growth, they say, will be rises in exports and in
consumer spending, and higher spending by the government. They add that
improved domestic and foreign demand will help manufacturers. The CBI
expects manufacturing output to start rising on a year-on-year basis around
the middle of this year and to expand at an annual 3.4 per cent rate in the
fourth quarter of this year and in 1993.
The number of jobs in manufacturing industry is expected to fall by nearly
220,000 between the end of March this year and the end of next year. The CBI
expects seasonally adjusted unemployment excluding school leavers to
increase to 2.9m next year from 2.8m this year with the unemployment rate
rising to 10.3 per cent from 9.7 per cent.
The CBI warns that the path of the recovery could be bumpy. Growth is likely
to be pick up in the current quarter following the general election. But it
could slow a little in the third quarter before rising to around the UK's
underlying trend rate of 2.5 per cent in the fourth quarter and in 1993.
CBI economists also warn that the strength of the recovery is 'by no means
assured'. The state of the housing market - with activity low and prices
falling - could weaken confidence.
The US recovery is uneven while the present low value of the dollar makes
exporting to the US and some other countries difficult for UK companies.
Inflationary pressures in Germany may force the Bundesbank to raise interest
rates and so restrict growth in Europe, thereby hurting UK exports.
However, the CBI expects UK bank base rates to fall to 9.5 per cent by the
end of this year and 8 per cent by the end of next year as German monetary
conditions ease.
It also predicts a recovery in UK non-oil company profits of 7.5 per cent in
real terms this year and 12.5 per cent next year. It says such an
improvement would reflect lower unit labour costs, improved profit margins,
better cost control and lower inflation.
The CBI nevertheless expects manufacturing industry to cut investment until
the fourth quarter of this year. Next year, however, it expects a rise of
4.5 per cent in manufacturing investment and an increase of 4.7 per cent in
total capital spending.

THE NUMBER of company liquidations fell slightly during the first quarter,
supporting hopes that the recession may have bottomed out, Paul Taylor
writes.
Compulsory and voluntary liquidations totalled 6,035 in the first three
months of the year compared with 6,017 in the previous quarter, according to
KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm. That compares with a 30.7 per cent
rise between the third and final quarters last year. Company liquidations in
the early months of this year were still 10.2 per cent higher than in the
first quarter of last year.
Mr Tim Hayward, head of corporate recovery at KPMG, said: 'There are signs
that the economy may be starting to come off the bottom, although we shall
need to wait and see whether the recovery can be sustained.'
The number of individual bankruptcies in the first quarter was 8,389, a 20.9
per cent rise on the previous quarter and a 73.5 per cent rise on the same
quarter last year. Mr Hayward said debtors petitioning for their own
bankruptcy may have caused the rise. Changes in procedure had made
petitioning less painful.
