MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE 
Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman lost a court battle in Stockholm Tuesday 
for symbolic damages of one crown -- 15 cents -- from the evening newspaper 
Aftonbladet, which he claimed had violated the copyright of his memoirs. 
Bergman and his publishers, Nordstedts, took the national daily to court two 
weeks ago, alleging that it had published an article based on unedited material 
from his biography "Laterna Magica" before it was published in 1987.ALEENE
