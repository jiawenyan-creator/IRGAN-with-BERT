FT  06 JUN 94 / More outside costs for business
Economic recovery is to some extent being hindered by 'significant'
increases in externally imposed extra costs on business, such as crime
prevention, says a survey of financial directors published today by the
Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.
Financial directors in both the private and public sectors listed health and
safety costs as one of the fastest rising items in their budgets.
While the majority of respondents agreed it was right for health and safety
regulations to be tightened, they pointed out that costs in this area had
risen at a far greater rate than average costs.
Companies in the south-east were also concerned about large rises in
insurance premiums for cover against terrorism.
