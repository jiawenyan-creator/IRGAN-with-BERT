FT  03 FEB 92 / Letter: Why not a level airport?
Sir, Paul Betts has sadly fallen into the habit of several other aviation
correspondents when referring to London City as 'the loss making airport,'
while Stansted is described as a 'Pounds 400m complex'.
I have no quibble with either description in isolation, but within the same
article ('Zurich jet service brings boost for City airport', January 30) why
bias the reader one way or the other?
If we wish to describe airports according to their profit-making ability,
let's refer to both Stansted and Gatwick as loss-making airports in line
with their 1991 published accounts.
