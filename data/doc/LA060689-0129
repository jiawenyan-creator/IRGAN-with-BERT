LACK OF PRENATAL CARE IN SAN DIEGO IS SPOTLIGHTED IN KPBS-TV SPECIAL 
Three hundred pregnant women arrive each month at hospital emergency rooms in 
San Diego County to give birth without ever having seen a doctor during their 
pregnancy, according to a KPBS-TV-produced documentary airing tonight ) at 8 
p.m. on Channel 15. 
"Victims at Birth" concentrates on three areas affecting San Diego's rising 
infant mortality rate: denial of prenatal care to expectant mothers, a rise in 
drug and alcohol use among pregnant women and a surge in the number of 
teen-agers who give birth. For those viewers unfamiliar with the problems, the 
pictures and statistics can be more than a little shocking. 
There are scenes in the emergency rooms of local hospitals, where doctors must 
confront the uncertainty of delivering babies for mothers that have not 
received proper prenatal care. Mothers lament the inadequacies of financial-aid 
programs. Doctors complain about the problems of getting paid by low-income 
mothers. 
"I never expected that I'd be denied medical treatment because of financial 
considerations," an incredulous mother explains. 
Show producer Matthew Eisen uses gripping footage of newborn babies to 
highlight and illustrate, not sensationalize. The statistics, the cold-hard 
facts, adequately make the necessary points. More than 3,000 teen-age girls in 
San Diego County become mothers each year, for example. 
After the hourlong special, KGTV (Channel 10) reporter Marti Emerald will be 
the host of a live follow-up discussion on the issues and possible solutions, 
beginning at 9 p.m. The panel will include Kim Warma, supervisor of the 
Regional Perinatal System, and Maria Leech, program manager for South Bay Drug 
Abuse Services, in addition to doctors, government officials, legal 
representatives and social workers. 
The show will include a live phone-in segment so that viewers can ask panelists 
questions.
