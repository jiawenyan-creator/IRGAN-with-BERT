TWO VIEWS OF SECTION 
Every Sunday afternoon, for the last eight weeks, I have started to write this 
letter, but reconsidered, figuring "Nah, it will get better." Well it hasn't, 
so here is the letter: 
Enough already! Enough gardening, home repair and enough of "some washed-up 
star moves out of the area." At a time when Los Angeles is taking over as the 
real estate and financial capital of the United States, we are being informed 
that Burl Ives is moving to Washington state. In a year when major Century City 
and Westwood high-rise office buildings have changed hands, we are being 
informed that now is the time to plant fava beans and rhubarb. 
Maybe there should be a separate section for gardening and household tips. 
When we finally find the commercial section, on Page 17, the lead article is 
about a development that is being built by Tom Selleck's brother and father. It 
seems, unless your name is Joan Collins or Tom Selleck, your chance for meaty 
commercial real estate news is almost impossible. 
This is a major metropolitan city. Let's report on office, retail and 
industrial properties that are being sold, leased or developed.
