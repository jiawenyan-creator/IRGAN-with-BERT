<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Through Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships, ``SURFing the Physics Lab: A Partnership for AMO Physics''
will provide an opportunity for the Physics Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and
the National Science Foundation to join in partnership with American colleges and universities, stimulating outstanding
physics students to pursue scientific careers by exposing them to the world class atomic, molecular, optical and
radiation physicists and facilities in the NIST Physics Laboratory, and strengthening undergraduate AMO physics
curricula by forming the basis for ongoing collaborations. The NIST program director will work with physics department
chairs and directors of multi-disciplinary centers of excellence to identify outstanding undergraduates (including
graduating seniors) who would benefit from off-campus summer research in an honors academy environment. We recommend
a group of two candidates plus one alternate to be nominated by each institution, although larger or smaller groups
will be given equal consideration. The selected group of about twenty (20) students will spend approximately twelve
(12) weeks at the Physics Laboratory's Gaithersburg, MD campus, working one-on-one with NIST staff physicists;
actively engaged in projects that combine the quest for fundamental knowledge and direct applications to problems
of national importance; learning about non-academic alternatives for research careers; living science and seeing
how they can make a difference. The 12-week stipend for the summer of 1995 will be $3600. Students and NIST research
advisors will be paired based on the student's background and interests in the spring, to allow for adequate dialogue
between the students, the student's physics professors and NIST advisor about the intended project, to ensure that
the student arrives at NIST ready to contribute, and to prepare the student's physics professor for follow-up in the
fall. Good overlap of research interest will facilitate collaborations between NIST and the participating academic
partners. The students will collectively live in a nearby furnished apartment complex and participate in the many
NIST seminars and in a weekly SURFing the Physics Lab Summer Seminar Series. The students will all present a research
seminar at NIST and be encouraged to participate in a local or national scientific conference during the following
academic year. Given the significant lack of diversity in the present physics work force, we will aggressively seek
out competitive students from underrepresented groups or persons with disabilities. Costs for this program (stipend,
travel and housing) will be shared by NIST, NSF and the participating schools.
