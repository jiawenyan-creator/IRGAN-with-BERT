FT  30 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rise after release of home
sales data
US TREASURY prices rose across the board yesterday following an unexpected
decline in monthly home sales.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 102
5/8 , yielding 7.765 per cent. The two-year note was even firmer, up  3/16
at 100 11/32 , yielding 4.801 per cent.
Prices opened firmer amid hopes that the Federal Reserve's policy-making
Open Market Committee (FOMC), which meets today and tomorrow, will sanction
a cut in the discount rate, currently 3.5 per cent.
Recent evidence of economic weakness has buoyed hopes of a cut, and
yesterday's news of a 5.6 per cent drop in May new single-family home sales
only heightened the market's expectations.
The Fed, however, may not move until after the June employment report on
Thursday, although some insiders say the FOMC is likely to have advance
notice of the jobs data and could, therefore, lower rates before the
official release.
UK government bond prices fell back steadily during the day, losing nearly
half a point, due to the combination of sterling weakness and disappointment
over the outcome of the EC summit in Lisbon last weekend.
Sterling fell against the D-Mark, dipping below the 2.90 level to reach
2.8908/35 in the afternoon. Short-dated issues dropped by up to one-quarter
of a point, with the 10 1/2 per cent gilt due 1997 slipping from 104 3/4 to
104 17/32 . At the long end, the 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 tumbled
from 116 15/32 to 116 1/32 , while the recent auction stock - the 9 per cent
gilt due 2012 - fell from 35 3/8 to 35 1/16 , taking the partly-paid price.
Dealers said the weekend EC summit in Lisbon had proved a disappointment for
the gilt market due to the lack of a resolution on the future of the
Maastricht Treaty. 'The feeling is that the summit did not go any way
towards resolving the problems caused by Denmark's rejection of Maastricht',
said one economist.
THE German government bond market edged higher in dull trading yesterday,
with many of the market participants waiting for the release of the May
employment figures from the US on Thursday.
Dealers expressed some surprise that the European bond markets did not show
a more pronounced reaction to last weekend's EC summit in Lisbon. 'Given
that the markets wanted to hear about the bones of an agreement or plan to
get Maastricht back on the road again (at the Lisbon summit), I'm surprised
that the complete lack of clarity and lack of guidance in Lisbon did not
lead to a stronger reaction yesterday', said one dealer.
The state of Bavaria yesterday reported a cost-of-living increase of 0.3 per
cent in the month to mid-June, giving a year-on-year rise of 4.7 per cent.
The inflation figures were in line with expectations. Provisional consumer
price data for all of west Germany are due later this week.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 87.59 and edged up to 87.74 by
late afternoon, although volumes were low with only about 15,000 contracts
traded.
JAPANESE government bonds closed slightly weaker in Tokyo on profit-taking,
but picked up during London trading as the yen strengthened against the US
dollar.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue opened at 5.27 per cent, moved in a
range of 5.265 to 5.29 per cent, and closed in Tokyo at 5.285 per cent.
However, as the yen strengthened from 125.5 to 124.70 to the dollar during
London trading, dealers reported a rise in Japanese government bond prices.
The markets expect the Group of Seven industrialised nations to support a
strong yen at their meeting next week.
