FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Wellcome drug gets US approval
The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of Wellcome's
Retrovir in pregnant women infected with HIV, the virus that leads to Aids.
The decision comes less than two weeks after the go-ahead was given from one
of its advisory panels. Usually several months elapse between the panel's
verdict and approval or otherwise.
