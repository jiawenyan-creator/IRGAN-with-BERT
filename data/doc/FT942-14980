FT  18 APR 94 / Observer: Hopping mad
Is France limbering up for candidacy as a semi-detached member of the
European Union? One might be forgiven for thinking so after the French
delegation's antics at last week's signing of the Gatt agreement, which made
the normally bolshy Brits look like positively model European citizens.
French industry minister Gerard Longuet's first task in Marrakesh was to
break ranks with his fellow Europeans by presuming to speak for all 12
countries during private talks with Mickey Kantor, President Clinton's
special trade representative. Next, he insisted that EU governments append
their names separately, instead of signing and sealing the great document
'en bloc' as previously agreed.
The final straw was when Longuet provoked an emergency EU council meeting,
and promptly headed back to Paris. When he finally reappeared, 11 hungry
ministers, who had spent an evening without sustenance, marched out en
masse.
Hence, by the weekend, the only delegate in Marrakesh with a good word for
the French was Sir Leon Brittan, Europe's trade commiss-ioner. No doubt that
is down to Brittan's good-humoured patience, and is quite unrelated to his
bid for the Commission presidency, for which French support is crucial.
