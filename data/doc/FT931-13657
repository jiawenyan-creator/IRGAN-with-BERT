FT  22 JAN 93 / Lloyd's forecast to post Pounds 2.5bn loss for 1990 and 1991
LLOYD'S of London will report losses of at least Pounds 2.5bn over the next
two years, according to a forecast released yesterday by Chatset, the
research company which monitors developments at the insurance market.
The projections for 1990 and 1991 results - which Lloyd's reports three
years in arrears - are significantly worse than earlier forecasts. They
would bring cumulative losses at Lloyd's in the four years to 1991 to more
than Pounds 5bn, further straining the market's capital base, provided by
20,000 individuals or Names.
More than 10,000 Names have left Lloyd's since 1989, while attempts by
loss-making Names to obtain compensation have led to a tangle of legal
actions, with attendant publicity denting the market's image and reputation.
Chatset says losses for 1990, which Lloyd's will report in June, will amount
to Pounds 1.64bn, compared with earlier estimates of Pounds 1.15bn.
The market will still be heavily in the red in 1991, with a deficit of at
least Pounds 1bn. Chatset says its early figures indicate that 1992 'looks
like another loss-making year', partly due to claims of more than Dollars
1bn (Pounds 600m) from hurricane Andrew, which devastated parts of Louisiana
and Florida in August.
'Names will have to wait for 1993 possibly to make a profit and 1996 to
receive once again a cheque from Lloyd's,' said Mr John Rew, co-editor of
Chatset.
Explaining the figures, Mr Rew said many syndicates were still receiving
claims from so-called 'spiral' reinsurance business in which Lloyd's
syndicates and companies reinsure each other against catastrophe losses.
These related to losses in 1989, such as hurricane Hugo, and in 1990, such
as the January European storms.
Losses were also arising from asbestosis and pollution claims in the US,
many on policies underwritten up to 30 years ago.
The deficit demonstrated that Lloyd's syndicates had been selling insurance
too cheaply in spite of increasing rates during 1991. The market's 'premium
base was inadequate to meet the volume of claims', said Mr Rew.
The projections could stir controversy among underwriters and agents at the
market, who last year accused Chatset of 'alarmism' when it presented a
similar set of estimates. However, when the 1989 result was announced, it
emerged that Chatset had actually underestimated the size of the loss.
'Last year we were accused of living in cloud cuckoo land. I really wish we
were,' said Mr Rew, who accused Lloyd's of talking up prospects for future
profits.
