THE WORLD 
A black trade union is seeking to stop the sale of Mobil Corp. assets in South 
Africa until it negotiates a disinvestment procedure providing job security and 
other benefits, the union said. The Chemical Workers Industrial Union, which 
represents 1,200 of Mobil's 1,500 South African black workers, said it applied 
for relief to the Industrial Court, a government labor tribunal. Mobil said it 
is selling its operations to General Mining Union Corp. Ltd. "Far from being 
moral or politically progressive, Mobil has seriously disadvantaged its work 
force by selling to one of the most notoriously anti-union South African 
corporations," a union statement said. However, Mobil has said General Mining 
agreed to honor all existing labor agreements.
