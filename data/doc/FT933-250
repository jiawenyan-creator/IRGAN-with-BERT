FT  30 SEP 93 / Manila to resume IMF talks
THE PHILIPPINES has agreed with the International Monetary Fund to resume
negotiations on a medium-term financing programme to support economic
recovery, the government announced yesterday.
The last of the decade-long series of short-term programmes for Manila ended
in March and subsequent disagreements over revenue-enhancement measures
brought discussions on a successor programme to a stalemate.
The Philippines is looking to a three-year financing worth about Dollars
800m (Pounds 528m) that will help propel its economy towards double-digit
growth towards the end of this decade.
