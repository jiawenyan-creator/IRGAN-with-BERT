ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 5(a)(1) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires any person who intends to manufacture or import
a new chemical substance to submit a premanufacture notice (PMN) to EPA at least 90 days before manufacture or import
commences. Statutory requirements for section 5(a)(1) premanufacture notices are discussed in the final rule published
in the 

Federal Register

 of May 13, 1983 (48 FR 21722). In the 

Federal Register

 of November 11, 1984, (49 FR 46066) (40 CFR 723.250), EPA published a rule which granted a limited exemption from certain
PMN requirements for certain types of polymers. Notices for such polymers are reviewed by EPA within 21 days of receipt.
This notice announces receipt of 16 such PMN(s) and provides a summary of each.
