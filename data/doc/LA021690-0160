SOUTHLAND; 
MERCURY S&amp;L TO CUT STAFF 10% 
Troubled Huntington Beach-based Mercury Savings and Loan Assn., hit last month 
with severe operating restrictions, said today it has cut its staff by 10%, 
producing layoffs of about 70 people. 
Mercury, which lost $13.8 million in 1988 and $5.4 million in the first nine 
months of last year, said most of the staff cuts were in lending operations. 
Federal regulators on Jan. 19 ordered the firm to halt all lending and 
investment activities. 
The thrift said the cuts also included staff members from other areas and 
several executives, including Ronald Hansen, its chief financial officer since 
1983.
