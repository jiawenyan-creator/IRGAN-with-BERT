  [Text] Bratislava Jan 5 (CTK) -- Last year Slovakia lost 
too much wasting time, and the talent and goodwill of its 
population, Igor Uhrik, deputy chairman of the Slovak National 
Party (SNS), told journalists today. 
  He said he considered 1993 to be a lost year because 
Slovakia 
lost its good initial position it had acquired after the 1992 
elections. All of this was caused by the HZDS's (ruling 
Movement For a Democratic Slovakia) refusal to share power and 
decision-making after it won the elections. At that time, it 
was possible to create a broad coalition called for by President 
Michal Kovac in his New Year's address, Uhrik said. 
  The fact that the HZDS (66 deputies in the 150-seat Slovak 
parliament) started to discuss coalition with the SNS (14 
deputies) only last summer is an evidence of the failed policy 
of the party which had been refusing to share power for a year, 
Uhrik stated. 
  The principles of cooperation between the two parties will 
have to be somewhat modified now. The SNS cannot play the role 
of a mere "tool in the electoral machinery" in the coalition, 
Uhrik concluded.
