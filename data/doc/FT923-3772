FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Optimistic mood at Asda
Mr PATRICK Gillam, chairman of Asda, told shareholders that management had
been 'invigorated with a new sense of purpose' and had already succeeded in
stemming losses of market share.
'Current performance is encouraging against a difficult environment,' he
said.
However, he was gloomy about the general outlook for the food retailing
trade, saying that sales volumes were under pressure following the decline
in retail price inflation.
Asda would be affected this year by a record number of competitor store
openings.
Trading conditions would present a 'constant challenge' but the cost base
had been adjusted to match the new conditions.
Mr Gillam said the first Dales discount superstore continued to perform to
plan and a second one would open later this month in the Midlands. Another
experimental format would go on trial be trialled at Stoke Wolstanton later
this month.
Asda said it was continuing to negotiate with Costco, the US 'warehouse
club' operator, over the sale of a retail site at Trafford Park, Manchester.
Costco, which operates high-discount limited-line stores, has been looking
for sites in the UK for many months.
