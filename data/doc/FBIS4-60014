  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said that in his 
meeting with Yasir 'Arafat it was agreed that the PLO chairman 
would not arrive in the territories on 6 June, which is an 
emotionally charged date in the historic sense. Peres expressed 
disappointment with Jordan's hesitation and said that the 
regional economic conference slated to take place there had been 
moved to Morocco. 
  Our correspondent Gid'on Kouts reports that Foreign Minister 
Peres met with French President Francois Mitterrand this 
evening. In their meeting, Mitterrand presented France's 
position that there is no necessary link between the 
Syrian-Israeli negotiations and the Lebanese track. Peres 
replied that Lebanon's positions were too tightly linked to 
Syria's. President Mitterrand promised to help Israel gain full 
membership in the European Community in all matters related to 
science and research. This has met with the objections of 
several countries, including the United Kingdom. 
  Our correspondent adds that Foreign Minister Peres 
participated in a festive ceremony in memory of singer Yves 
Montand. The proceeds of the event will go to a cancer research 
laboratory named after the singer at the Weizman Institute.
