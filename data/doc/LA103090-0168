GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: HEATHER LOWE 
School: Cypress High 
Sport: Volleyball 
Position: Middle blocker 
Class: Sophomore 
Lowe, a six-foot middle blocker who has been averaging about 15 kills per 
match, outdid herself Thursday in a five-game victory over Los Alamitos. Lowe 
had 27 kills, including nine in the final game, which Cypress won, 15-12. 
"And they were going after her," Coach Jerry Gregg said. "They were triple 
blocking her and she was hitting through it and hitting over it." The rest of 
her game was strong as well -- she had five aces, five stuff blocks and served 
on the final point of the match. Gregg said her serve -- she has made more than 
90% of her serves this season -- is one of her best weapons. Outstanding play 
by Lowe, who had 15 kills Tuesday in a three-game sweep of El Dorado, is one of 
the main reasons the Centurions are 11-3 and 8-0 in Empire League play, in 
first place with two matches remaining this week. Lowe and teammates Misty 
Hartung and Lupe Nava are members of a Long Beach-based club team that won a 
United States Volleyball Assn. national championship last summer. 
Other top performers: 
* Tara Kroesch, who had 20 kills for Newport Harbor in a five-game volleyball 
victory over University Tuesday. 
* Anne Mall, who swept her three singles sets at love to lead Dana Hills to a 
10-8 tennis victory over Capistrano Valley Tuesday. 
* Keri Phebus, who helped Corona del Mar to a 10-8 victory over Miraleste 
Monday, sweeping her singles sets, 6-0, 6-0, 6-1.
