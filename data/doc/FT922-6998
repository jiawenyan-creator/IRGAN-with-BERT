FT  21 MAY 92 / Satellite TV market 'overestimated'
THE SIZE of the satellite television market in the UK has been significantly
overstated, according to a report.
GFK Home Audit, a market-research company, says 1.6m homes had satellite
television by the end of last year, compared to the 1.8m estimate by Barb,
which produces the official viewing figures, and a figure of 2.1m quoted by
Continental Research, a research company regularly quoted by the Financial
Times and British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television network in
which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake,
The GFK figure was based on interviews with 10,000 people last June and
updated with data from GFK Lek-Trak, which monitors more than 8,000
electrical retailers, including a sample of independents retailers.
'The GFK Home Audit provides the most accurate record yet of home satellite
ownership and suggests that there has been a substantial overstatement of
the market,' said Mr John Ramsbottom, managing director of GFK.
Mr Ramsbottom said his figures were supported by close comparison of film
channel viewing in his panel with figures produced by BSkyB.
Mr John Clemens, chairman of Continental, which puts the present number of
homes with satellite dishes at 2.4m, yesterday stood by his figures, which
are based on interviews with more than 4,000 adults every month.
Continental said its end-of-year dish figure was 1.95m - the 2.1m figure
includes homes served by a communal dish. Mr Clemens said Lek-Trak data
consistently underestimated the number of satellite dishes in the UK.
