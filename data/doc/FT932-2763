FT  17 JUN 93 / Observer: Li let loose
Another 1980's shooting star turned felon savours freedom. Ronald Li, former
chairman of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, walked out of Stanley prison
yesterday, where he had been serving time on corruption charges. Looking
every bit of his 63 years, Li told the world: 'I am an old man now; it's
time to retire.'
Whatever the authorities thought about his performance running the bourse,
Li proved a model inmate, beavering away in the library to earn the brownie
points that helped secure an early release. Still worth over HKDollars 7bn,
the 'uncle', as he was known to local brokers, can look forward to seeing
out his days in relative comfort.
