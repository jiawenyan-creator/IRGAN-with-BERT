  [Text] A North Korean soldier has asked South Korea for 
asylum after secretly boarding a South Korean cargo ship in 
China. At around 0530 [2030 GMT] this morning, Paek Yong-kil, 
first class sergeant of the 718 Army unit of the North Korean 
People's Army, secretly boarded a ship -- the Chihae Pioneer 
belonging to Heung-A Shipping Company -- asked for asylum upon 
entering Ulsan port. After fleeing from his country to China 
through the Yalu River on 23 November 1993, he secretly boarded 
the Chihae Pioneer ship, in Dalian, China, on 8 March and asked 
for asylum. He said in an interrogation that he had decided to 
defect to South Korea because he was getting tired of the 
socialist system.
