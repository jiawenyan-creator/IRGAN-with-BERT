WHAT WILL DAVIS SAY TO HIS NEW COACH, 'JUST DO OK, BABY'? 
Regardless of anyone's opinion of Al Davis, he is again to be commended for the 
ability to follow his own conscious, rather than maintain status quo. 
When he felt his franchise could reap economic benefits by moving from Oakland 
to Los Angeles, he proceeded despite opposition from the NFL hierarchy. 
When he felt the Raiders straying from the traditional path known as Raider 
football, he had the courage to make a change during the course of the regular 
season. More important, he drew upon a gem, Hall of Famer Art Shell, to 
resurrect the "pride and poise" that we have known as Raider football. 
As a footnote, the qualified person chosen happens to be black. Considering the 
significance of the event, it's great to feel that this factor had minimal 
importance, rather than being the motivation.
