FT  31 OCT 94 / Business Travel: Frankfurt terminal
Frankfurt airport, Europe's number one cargo hub and second only to London
Heathrow in passenger numbers, opened its new Terminal 2 last week.  It
hopes to siphon traffic away from crowded Heathrow.  'We're expecting around
4m to 5m passengers through Terminal 2 next year,' a spokesman said.  'It
can handle 12m passengers, and can be expanded.'
Frankfurt is readying to attract more international passenger and cargo
flights as Heathrow and Gatwick, London's other main airport, near
saturation.  Lufthansa, Germany's national airline, will occupy half of
Frankfurt's Terminal 1 together with about 90 minor airlines.  About DM500m
has been spent updating Lufthansa's facilities, which will also be used by
its partners, Thai Airways and United Airlines.
Around 20 international airlines including British Airways, Delta Airlines,
Deutsche BA, Japan Airlines and Air France, will move to the new terminal,
which will be connected to Terminal 1 via an automatic overhead railway
similar to Gatwick's.
Frankfurt has also spent large sums on an underground baggage-handling
system.
