  [Text] According to Yemeni political sources, rival Yemeni 
parties have reached an agreement on political and military 
measures to put an end to the crisis which has paralyzed the 
Yemeni Government. It has been learned that a 27-member 
national dialogue committee has been set up to settle the 
differences between Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 
Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, head of the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP], with which Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas 
is affiliated. 
  The YSP denied charges it attributed to Yemeni President 
'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih that southern Yemeni leaders are seeking to 
undermine Yemeni unity through a conspiracy with Saudi Arabia 
and Kuwait. In a statement, the YSP affirmed that it will 
continue its firm course to improve Yemen's relations with its 
neighbors and halt all practices and reactions that harm Yemen's 
relations with its neighbors and prevent the promotion of these 
relations.
