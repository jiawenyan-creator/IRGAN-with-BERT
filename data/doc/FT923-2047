FT  19 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei inches up on
political support
JAPANESE equities closed marginally higher on late afternoon index-linked
buying after Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, said that the
government would, if necessary, take additional fiscal measures to support
the economy, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed up 50.28 at 18,166.80, barely changed on the week,
recording a day's low of 17,758.13 and a high of 18,273.58. Profit-taking
pushed the index lower during most of the session. However, late afternoon
buying by arbitrageurs and investment trusts buoyed the market in the final
hour.
Volume rose slightly to 330m shares from 283m. Analysts pointed out that
dull volume represented possible near term sluggishness in share prices.
Declines outnumbered advances by 527 to 399, with 203 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks lost 1.58 to 1,354.05 and in London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.23 to 1,085.70.
While some traders blamed volatile currency markets for the quiet trading
others remarked that the effect of European currency movements on Japanese
financial markets seemed to be minimal.
Activity centered on short-term trading of speculative issues. Mining and
metal issues which rose on Thursday on reports of a gold mine discovery in
southern Japan were traded actively. Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting, the most
active issue of the day, advanced Y17 to Y470. However, Sumitomo Metal
Mining fell Y34 to Y748 on profit taking.
Securities houses saw downward earnings revisions, and there was a modicum
of downward movement although analysts said that the weak business prospects
had already been discounted. Nikko Securities fell Y8 to Y725 and Yamaichi
Securities Y25 to Y635, but Nomura Securities, the largest broker, remained
unchanged at Y1,630.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 110.26 to 19,391.15 in volume of 20.3m
shares.
