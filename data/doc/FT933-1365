FT  24 SEP 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Insuring for Lloyd's future
In a move which should bring a sigh of relief to hard-pressed Lloyd's names,
a specialist software house has launched a package to indicate the future
performance of individual insurance syndicates.
Whitespace Software, which supplies some 40 per cent of Lloyd's members
agents with software products, developed its Exegesis package in accord with
the market's new emphasis on professionalism and information transparency.
The software modelling package, using ObjectIQ, the programming tool from
Hitachi of Japan, will enable agents to make probability assessments for
each of the 228 syndicates. Publicly available information will be combined
with agents' own knowledge and experience. Whitespace Software: UK, 071 287
2860.
