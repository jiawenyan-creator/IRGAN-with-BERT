  [Text] Aranyaprathet -- The Thai military has threatened 
to close the border here with the Cambodian town of Poipet if 
Cambodian forces refuse to pay for damage caused by a recent 
rocket attack on a village. 
  Col. Wanchai Nuansukhum, chief of the Aranyaprathet Task 
Force, issued the ultimatum at a press conference in this border 
town yesterday. 
  He said a woman was injured and about 20,000 baht in damage 
was caused to houses last Monday when seven 107-mm rockets, 
believed to have been fired by Cambodian government forces, 
crashed into Tambon Khlong Namsai. 
  The colonel said that even though the closure would affect 
the local economy, it was necessary to protect the lives and 
property of Thai villagers near the border. 
  Since Tuesday, all trucks and cars have been banned from 
crossing the border via Khlong Luk bridge, but push carts have 
been allowed through the nearby border crossing at Talat Rong 
Khlua. More than 30 million baht worth of goods has been held 
up on the Thai side by the partial closure, and the number of 
visitors to Aranyaprathet and Poipet has dropped dramatically. 
  Col. Wanchai said he wants to find out from Cambodian forces 
whether the shelling was deliberate or accidental. He had asked 
Cambodian Gen. Lai Vira, commander of the 12th Division, for 
talks to discuss paying compensation and to ensure that fighting 
is contained within Cambodia. 
  Cambodia's warring factions had earlier been warned that 
Thai 
forces would fire smoke shells or flares if Cambodian shells 
landed in Thailand, and if the shelling continued, live fire 
would be returned. he said.
