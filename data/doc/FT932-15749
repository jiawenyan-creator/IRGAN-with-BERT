FT  10 APR 93 / Union warns Mercury of anger over redundancies
THE National Communications Union has accused Mercury Communications, the
Cable &amp; Wireless subsidiary, of failing to carry out compulsory redundancies
properly.
The union has warned Mercury that it could face industrial tribunal cases
from former employees.
The union, which is not recognised by the company, has written to Mr Robert
Johnston, Mercury's personnel director, alleging that the company has not
looked for suitable alternative jobs for all employees who face redundancy.
The union also says that consultation procedures are inadequate and the
selection criteria for redundancy are sometimes vague.
About 50 employees out of the workforce of about 9,000 were made redundant
last year, following a reorganisation.
The union says there could be as many as 200 further compulsory redundancies
as the result of an efficiency drive.
Mr Johnston dismissed the figure as 'scaremongering' and said almost all of
the 200 were likely to be redeployed because there were also currently more
than 700 vacancies in the company.
It was expected the workforce would grow by about 1,000 in the current
financial year, Mr Johnston said.
A redundancy policy had been formalised during the past year and staff had
been fully consulted, he added.
One or two of the redundancies might not have been handled as well as he
would have liked and some staff could have 'left feeling bitter about their
experience'.
The union, which has the bulk of its membership in British
Telecommunications, says it has just under 700 members at Mercury. Mr
Johnston said the company preferred 'to deal with individuals as
individuals' rather than through a union.
