  [Abstract] The towed probe chain examined here is a set of 
six CTD probes spaced 10-50 m apart in simultaneous operation on 
a tow line. One is the Mark III profiler, produced by NBIS, USA. 
Katran 04M probes made by the Akvastandard Scientific Production 
Association in Sevastopol are used at other levels for economic 
reasons. To obtain fine structure profiles and high-resolution 
cross sections on the route, scanning is used with an amplitude 
which provides a certain overlap of levels at a boat speed of 3 
m/s. Two scanning modes are available, one which minimizes 
overlap to increase horizontal resolution, and one which has a 
large overlap to increase the sounding depth. The Mark III probe 
is the fourth from the surface in the configuration displayed in 
the paper. The communication cable length may extend to 3 km 
without adverse effect. Illustrations show the configuration of 
the system and the trajectories of the probes in scanning mode. 
Data is recorded on a IBM PC/AT 386 clone. Profiles may be 
displayed in real time, but not printed (printing interferes 
with measurement). Examples of profiles obtained in Gulf Stream 
research are shown. The probes may be used together, separately, 
or in any combination. Figures 6; table 1; references 4: 2
