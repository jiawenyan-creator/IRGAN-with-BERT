  [Text] Kazan -- Tataria Vice Premier Ravil Muratov has 
stated that a balance of "promarketeers" and conservatives will 
be ensured in the new government which is to be formed before 
September. According to him, there is a need to cut the number 
of vice premiers, replace the Cabinet of Ministers' sectoral 
departments with an institution of referents, and reduce the 
number of ministries and committees. Muratov also considers it 
necessary to create an analytical center to formulate government 
strategy. The vice prime minister proposes setting up a 
so-called Republican Agricultural Chamber, regarding it, along 
with Tataria's Chamber of Industry and Commerce, as the main 
opponents to the Cabinet of Ministers.
