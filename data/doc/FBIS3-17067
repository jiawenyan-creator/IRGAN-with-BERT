"Court of Appeal in Operation"] 
  [Text] At a routine session the Russian Federation 
president's court of appeal examined and assessed several items 
published by the weekly NOVYY VZGLYAD which grossly violating 
legal and universally recognized ethical norms. NOVYY VZGLYAD 
chief editor Ye. Dodolev was issued with a warning. The court 
of appeal believes that there are every grounds for warning the 
chief editor that NOVYY VZGLYAD may cease publication. The 
court of appeal has sent its materials to the Russian Federation 
Committee for the Press -- as the registering organ -- to take 
the steps stipulated by the law. A warning has also been issued 
to MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA chief editor Sh. Muladzhanov since the 
court of appeal has established that the MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA 
editorial office is promoting the production, dissemination, and 
advertizing of NOVYY VZGLYAD.
