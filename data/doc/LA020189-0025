SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
The campus at Patrick Henry High School in San Carlos will remain open for 
students to leave during lunch period, although two San Diego Unified School 
District board members said Tuesday that they favor changing district policy 
and closing campuses during lunch at all high schools in the district. 
At a closed campus no students would be allowed to leave the school grounds 
during lunch periods. 
A school committee from Henry studied the matter at the suggestion of many 
parents and board member Jim Roache. The panel recommended Tuesday that the 
school remain an open campus, despite an overwhelming desire on the part of 
teachers and parents for closing. Roache and colleague Shirley Weber questioned 
the conclusions drawn from the data and were joined by several parents who said 
a closed campus would lessen drug and alcohol use during lunch and promote 
school pride. 
Parents and business people from Tierrasanta attacked the report, especially 
the contention that costs would increase with closed campuses because more 
security guards would be need. Tierrasanta residents also favor closing Serra 
High School during lunch hours. 
Although Supt. Tom Payzant said he will not initiate a change in districtwide 
policy, Tierrasanta residents could ask for a study of Serra High leading to a 
closed campus, or Weber and Roache could propose an overall policy change or a 
school-by-school option.
