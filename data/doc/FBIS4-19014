<F P=106> ["R.R." report: "Berlusconi: `No Cleanup Operation'"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi 
denies ever having considered a "cleanup operation." There will 
be no beheading of the "mandarins" of the First Republic, nor of 
the leading men in the ministries and the main state-owned 
companies. This was the commitment made by the Forza Italia 
leader who returned to the battleground yesterday afternoon in 
an interview with [fourth TV channel news broadcast] TG4. 
  Berlusconi stated: "I too have read about vendettas, and 
cleanups. They appear completely alien to me, and in any case 
are far from my mind and my way of thinking. I even think no 
one should have cause for concern." In short, a Berlusconi 
government would not apply the "spoil system," or 
across-the-board changes to the leaders of the administration as 
is traditionally applied by the American system. Berlusconi 
said: "As far as I am concerned, we have to roll up our sleeves 
and work together at rebuilding our country. There are so many 
problems to resolve that it is only by pulling together that we 
can hope to get through." Moreover, everyone who has written 
about clean ups and vendettas had better, in the words of the 
leader, "think twice." [passage omitted]
