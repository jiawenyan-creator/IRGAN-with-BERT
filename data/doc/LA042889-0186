IN BRIEF; 
AMERICAN WINS YUGOSLAV SAIL RACE 
American skipper Paul Cayard today won Yugoslavia's most prestigious sailing 
competition, defeating defending world champion Chris Dickson of New Zealand. 
The Tanjug news agency said Cayard's Bianca 107 boat won the eighth and 
decisive race of the ACY Cup, counting for the World Sailing Championships, 
defeating Dickson at the regatta in Rovinj, on Yugoslavia's northern Adriatic 
coast. Although another regatta is to be held on Saturday, Cayard, of San 
Francisco, has already built up an unstoppable lead over Dickson, his closest 
competitor.
