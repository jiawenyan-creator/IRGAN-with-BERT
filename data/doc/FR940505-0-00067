 



Facts

. (1) In each example assume that P, an individual, holds 1,500 shares of $1,000 par value preferred stock of X corporation
(bearing an annual noncumulative dividend of $100 per share that may be put to X at any time for par value) and 1,000 shares
of voting common stock of X. There is no other outstanding stock of X. The annual exclusion under section 2503 is not
allowable with respect to any gift.

(2) On January 15, 1991, when the aggregate fair market value of the preferred stock is $1,500,000 and the aggregate
fair market value of the common stock is $500,000, P transfers all 1,000 shares of the common stock to P's child. Section
2701 applies to the initial transfer because P transferred an equity interest (the common stock) to a member of P's
family and immediately thereafter held an applicable retained interest (the preferred stock). The fair market value
of P's interest in X immediately prior to the transfer is $2,000,000 and the section 2701 value of the preferred stock
(the section 2701 interest) is zero. With respect to the initial transfer, the amount remaining after Step 2 of the
subtraction method of 25.27013 was $2,000,000 ($2,000,000 minus zero), all of which is allocated to
the transferred stock. P had made no gifts prior to 1991. The sum of P's aggregate taxable gifts for the calendar year
1991 (including the section 2701 transfer) is $2,500,000. P's spouse, S, made no gifts prior to 1991.

(3) P and S elected pursuant to section 2513 to treat one- half of their 1991 gifts as having been made by each spouse.
Without the application of section 2701, P and S's aggregate gifts would have been $500,000 and each spouse would have
paid no gift tax because of the application of the unified credit under section 2505. However, because of the application
of section 2701, both P and S are each treated as the initial transferor of aggregate taxable gifts in the amount of $1,250,000
and, after the application of the unified credit under section 2505, each paid $255,500 in gift tax with respect to
their 1991 transfers. On October 1, 1994, at a time when the value of the preferred stock is the same as at the time of the
initial transfer, P transfers the preferred stock (the section 2701 interest) to P's child.



Example 1. Inter vivos transfer of entire section 2701 interest. 

P transfers all of the preferred stock to P's child. P and S are each entitled to a reduction of $750,000 in computing
their 1994 gift tax. P is entitled to the reduction because P subsequently transferred the one-half share of the section
2701 interest as to which P was the initial transferor to an individual who was not an applicable family member of P.
S is entitled to the reduction because P, an applicable family member with respect to S, transferred the one-half share
of the section 2701 interest as to which S was the initial transferor to an individual other than S or an applicable family
member of S. S may claim the reduction against S's 1994 gifts. If S's 1994 taxable gifts are less than $750,000, S may
claim the remaining amount of the reduction against S's next succeeding lifetime transfers.



Example 2. Inter vivos transfer of portion of section 2701 interest. 

P transfers one-fourth of the preferred stock to P's child. In this case, P and S are each entitled to a reduction of $187,500,
the corresponding portion of the reduction otherwise available to each spouse (one-fourth of $750,000).



Example 3. Transfer at death of donor spouse. 

P, the donor spouse in the section 2513 election, dies on October 1, 1994, while holding all of the preferred stock.
The executor of P's estate is entitled to a reduction in the computation of the tentative tax under section 2001(b).
Since no reduction had been previously available with respect to the section 2701 interest, P's estate is entitled
to a full reduction of $750,000 with respect to the one-half share of the preferred stock as to which P was the initial
transferor. In addition, P's estate is entitled to an additional reduction of up to $750,000 for the remaining section
2701 interest as to which S was the initial transferor. The reduction for the consenting spouse's remaining section
2701 interest is limited to that amount that will produce a tax saving in P's Federal estate tax of $255,500, the amount
of gift tax incurred by S by reason of the application of section 2701 to the split initial transfer.



Example 4. Transfer after death of donor spouse. 

The facts are the same as in 

Example 3

, except that S acquires the preferred stock from P's estate and subsequently transfers the preferred stock to S's
child. S is not entitled to a reduction because S ceased to be an initial transferor upon P's death (and S's prior taxable
gifts were automatically adjusted at that time to the level that would have existed had the split initial transfer
not been subject to section 2701).



Example 5. Death of donor spouse after inter vivos transfer.

 (i) P transfers one-fourth of the preferred stock to P's child. In this case, P and S are each entitled to a reduction
of $187,500, the corresponding portion of the reduction otherwise available to each spouse (one-fourth of $750,000).
S may claim the reduction against S's 1994 or subsequent transfers. P dies on November 1, 1994.

(ii) P's executor is entitled to include, in computing the reduction available to P's estate, the remaining reduction
to which P is entitled and an additional amount of up to $562,500 ($750,000 minus $187,500, the amount of the remaining
reduction attributable to the consenting spouse determined immediately prior to P's death). The amount of additional
reduction available to P's estate cannot exceed the amount that will reduce P's estate tax by $178,625, the amount
that S's 1991 gift tax would have been increased if the application of section 2701 had increased S's taxable gifts
by only $562,500 ($750,000 ^ $187,500).




(g) 

Double taxation otherwise avoided. 

No reduction is available under this section if_

(1) Double taxation is otherwise avoided in the computation of the estate tax under section 2001 (or section 2101);
or

(2) A reduction was previously taken under the provisions of section 2701(e)(6) with respect to the same section 2701
interest and the same initial transfer.

(h) 

Effective date. 

This section is effective for transfers of section 2701 interests after May 4, 1994. If the transfer of a section 2701
interest occurred on or before May 4, 1994, the initial transferor may rely on either this section, project PS3091
(19912 C.B. 1118, and 19921 C.B. 1239 (see 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter)) or any other reasonable interpretation of the statute.
