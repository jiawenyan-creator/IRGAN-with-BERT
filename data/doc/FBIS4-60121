  [Text] Brother President Yasir 'Arafat, president of the 
state of Palestine and chairman of the PLO Executive Committee, 
this evening received Mr. John McCarthy, U.S. ambassador to 
Tunisia. 
  During the meeting, President 'Arafat received from his 
excellency the U.S. ambassador an important message from Mr. 
Warren Christopher, the U.S. secretary of state, pertaining to 
the incident that led to the killing of two Israeli soldiers in 
the Arez area at the northern exit of Gaza Sector yesterday 
morning, and the gravity such incident poses to the peace 
process. 
  The message also concerns the invitation of Norway, in its 
capacity as president of the Liaison Committee of Donators to 
hold an urgent meeting on this coming Monday, 23 May, in 
Washington. 
  Secretary Christopher stressed in his message the United 
States' support for this meeting and its success in order to 
begin the process of development to consolidate peace. 
  It is worth noting that the aim of the perpetrators was not 
only to confront the Israelis who withdrew from Gaza two days 
ago, but also to confront the Palestinian national security and 
its direct responsibilities in the Gaza Sector and to its 
population according to the signed agreement.
