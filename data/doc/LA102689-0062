EARNINGS 
Comprehensive Care: The nation's largest alcohol and drug treatment company 
reported a $4.7-million first-quarter loss, sending the Irvine company's stock 
price down from $8.375 to $3.625 and endangering a critical merger with First 
Hospital Corp. Revenue during the first quarter fell 17% to $44 million; the 
$4.7-million loss contrasts with a $1.6-million profit in the same period a 
year earlier. The company, which operates the CareUnit chain of treatment 
centers, has suffered recently as fewer and fewer people use its facilities and 
those who do aren't staying as long as they once did.
