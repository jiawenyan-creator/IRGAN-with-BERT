FIREPOWER AT LA QUINTA; 
JALEWALIA SCORES, REBOUNDS -- AND PASSES THE NEWS TOO 
Need a couple of points? Amy Jalewalia will score them. Inside or out, layup or 
jump shot, off the dribble or off the pass, La Quinta High School's versatile 
basketball player can score. 
Need three points? No sweat. Jalewalia has made 27 of 52 three-point shots this 
season. 
Need the results of the game phoned to the local paper? Jalewalia does that 
too, but she draws the line at picking up shirts from the laundry. She is too 
busy taking opponents to the cleaners. 
Jalewalia, a 6-foot-3, 130-pound junior, leads the Southern Section in scoring 
with a 31.2-point average. She gives new meaning to the term triple-threat, 
having played guard, forward and center. She is an obvious choice, with some 
consideration to Brea-Olinda's Aimee McDaniel, to succeed Katella's Joni 
Easterly as the premier girls' basketball player in Orange County next season. 
She leads her team in every statistical category, including assists (4.5 per 
game) and rebounds (13), and helped La Quinta (21-3 overall, 14-0 in league 
play) capture its eighth consecutive Garden Grove League title and win its 40th 
consecutive league game. The Aztecs are ranked third in the Southern Section 
3-A. 
And while her coach, Kevin Kiernan, is busy doubling as a boys' varsity 
assistant, she phones results, including her statistics, to the newspapers. 
The Garden Grove League is not exactly the hotbed of Orange County girls' 
basketball and that accounts, in part, for Jalewalia's scoring dominance. But 
it would be a mistake to think that's the primary reason. 
Jalewalia plays on a team with no senior starters. When she scores, much of the 
time she does it on her own. (After Jalewalia, the team's assist leader is Lucy 
Wong with 3.7 a game.) 
"She creates so much on her own off steals, off the press, she pulls up for 
jump shots," Kiernan said. "If we had a true point guard who pushed it up the 
floor and could distribute the ball a little better, it would be scary how many 
baskets Amy could score." 
It's downright frightening for Garden Grove League opponents to know she has 
her senior season left to play, especially considering the strides she has made 
each season. 
She was a part-time starter as a freshman. She spent the month of December in 
India attending a cousin's wedding and visiting relatives. When she returned, 
she injured her left knee. She recovered but was sidelined again with a stress 
fracture in her foot, which kept her out of the Aztecs' quarterfinal playoff 
loss. 
As a sophomore, Jalewalia averaged about 13 points a game and was voted the 
Aztecs' most improved player. 
She has more than doubled her offensive production this season, proving herself 
worthy of the most improved plaque she won last year. She keeps that and her 
other basketball memorabilia in her room. The collection includes team 
pictures, trophies, a poster of Michael Jordan -- "because he is a cool player" 
-- a piece of a Rancho Alamitos jersey, the Aztecs' toughest competitor in 
league play; and a bumper sticker for Louisiana Tech that reads: "Lady 
Techsters, National Champs Again." 
She picked up the sticker at the university while playing for an Amateur 
Athletic Union basketball team. 
"When we went to Louisiana, the teams were really good," she said. "It made me 
think you've really got to work hard because there are a lot of better players 
out there." 
Her intent to become a complete player has Jalewalia focusing on aspects other 
than scoring. And considering she would rather pass than shoot, her offensive 
accomplishments are all the more phenomenal. 
"I would prefer it if we had more balanced scoring," Jalewalia said. "It would 
take a lot of pressure off me and give the team a bigger boost. 
"Once I get out of high school, I know I am not going to be scoring like this. 
You've got to prove yourself as a defensive player too. I don't know, I just 
try not to concentrate on just score, score, score. If the scoring comes, good. 
But I would like to just get back to defense." 
Kiernan has her working on improving her intensity and developing the "innate 
toughness" he sees reflected in the eyes of players such as Easterly and 
McDaniel. 
"I think a lot of this comes easy to her," Kiernan said. "You watch her play 
and it is just so easy. She uses the left hand, she uses the right hand, she 
just moves so well, and sometimes the level of the game drops and she can get 
by playing half speed." 
Jalewalia started playing basketball with her mother, Sharon, who played some 
as a 5-7 forward at Marylhurst College in Oregon. 
"Basketball was my favorite sport when I grew up, so it was my interest to 
teach her," Sharon Jalewalia said. She began by taking Amy to watch Deepak, 
Amy's older brother, play in recreation games. 
"She and I used to go and shoot around and just have fun at the park. Her 
brother played a lot of sports and I used to take her along. During halftime or 
warmups, I used to throw her the ball." 
Amy's father, Gurpreet, is from India. Amy is short for Amardeep, which means 
"always the source of light" in Punjabi. 
With an inexperienced and untested team heading into the pressure of the 
playoffs, Kiernan is looking to Jalewalia to light it up. He also wants to keep 
things light. 
"Last year we went in real tight and just played not to lose," said Kiernan, 
whose team was eliminated in the second round of the playoffs and finished 
22-4. "This year we're going to have some fun in the playoffs. 
"And when you've got a player like Amy, you never know. You've always got a 
shot."JALEWALIA BY GAME
