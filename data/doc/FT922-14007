FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Beeb on top - Ballot Box
One early election winner is likely to be the BBC, which is holding its lead
over ITN in the news-programme ratings.
The average Barb figures for the first two full weeks of the campaign put
the audience for the Nine O'Clock News at 6.2m, against 5.7m for News at
Ten. In the second week, however, News at Ten closed the gap and took a
whisker of a lead  - 6.1m against the BBC's 6m  - although that would
probably have to be called a dead heat under BBC rules for dealing with
relatively small samples.
The BBC's One O'Clock News and Six O'Clock News maintained their large lead
over ITN equivalents: 4.2m against 2.7m at lunch and 7.5m to 6.4m in the
early evening in the second week. Newsnight and Channel 4 News continue to
slug it out with Newsnight on 1m to C4's 900,000.
Overall audiences for news programmes were up on the same period last year,
but if you want a sense of perspective Coronation Street and EastEnders are
still pulling in 19.63m and 15.69m respectively.
