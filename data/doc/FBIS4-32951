  [Text] Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan, Politburo 
member, has called for the strict implementation of Cuban 
agrarian laws and demands that farmers fulfill their food 
delivery commitments. 
  In Matanzas, Jordan pointed out that it is inadmissible that 
there are farmers who so far this year have not delivered a 
single quintal of agrarian products. Jordan stressed that the 
people's food supply is inviolable and that whoever has arable 
lands and production agreements with the state is obligated to 
fulfill the terms of the agreements. Jordan added that more 
severity will be imposed against farmers who fail to deliver, 
and if necessary, firm application of measures provided for in 
the Agrarian Law will be used. Finally, Jordan announced that 
the government is considering levying a tax on fallow lands.
