FT  26 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: South Africa's missing structure
Sir, Patti Waldmeir's contention that 'western-style democracy will find it
hard to resolve' South Africa's conflicts (July 22) needs qualifying.
Western democracy began with local government, from which democratic
national government evolved. Local conflicts described by Ms Waldmeir need
the appropriate local structures for accountability and conflict resolution.
What South Africa must avoid is the 'African-style democracy' that plunged
Angola back into civil war: an imposed national poll, within a virtually
non-existent constitutional framework, with an overwhelming popular
perception of winner-take-all. The South African negotiators' setting of a
national poll date, preceding any clear decision on what South Africans will
actually be voting for, can only set alarm bells ringing.
