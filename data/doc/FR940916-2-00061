</DOCTITLE>



The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and
carcinogenesis studies of 3,4-dihydrocoumarin, which is used as a flavoring agent in beverages, gelatins, puddings,
candy, and other food items and as a fragrance in perfumes, creams, and cosmetics. 

Toxicity and carcinogenicity studies were conducted by administering 3,4-dihydrocoumarin (99% pure) in corn oil
by gavage to groups of 60 male and female F344/N rats at doses of 0, 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg body weight for 2 years. Groups
of 70 male and female B6C3F mice received 3,4-dihydrocoumarin in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0, 200, 400, or 800 mg/kg
body weight for 2 years. 

Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 of 3,4-dihydrocoumarin in male F344/N rats based on increased incidence of renal tubule adenomas and focal hyperplasia.
The transitional cell carcinomas in two 600 mg/kg males may also have been chemical related. There was no evidence
of carcinogenic activity of 3,4-dihydrocoumarin in female F344/N rats receiving 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg. There was
no evidence of carcinogenic activity of 3,4-dihydrocoumarin in male B6C3F1 mice receiving 200, 400, or 800 mg/kg.
There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular
adenoma and hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined).

The NTP uses five categories of evidence of carcinogenic activity observed in each animal study: two categories for
positive results (``clear evidence'' and ``some evidence''), one category for uncertain findings (``equivocal
evidence''), one category for no observable effect (``no evidence''), and one category for studies that cannot be
evaluated because of major flaws (``inadequate study'').

3,4-Dihydrocoumarin caused ulcers, hyperplasia, and inflammation of the forestomach, parathyroid gland hyperplasia,
and increased severity of nephropathy in male rats.
