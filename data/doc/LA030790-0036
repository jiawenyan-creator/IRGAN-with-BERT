DR. NEIL SOLOMON: LOOKS AND HEALTH 
Question: Anyone who can read should know by now that sunbathing not only does 
not make a person more attractive but can do damage to the skin. 
Are there any other possible dangers to our appearance that we should be aware 
of? 
Answer: Some of the factors that influence our appearance are beyond our powers 
to control. Age, for example, is one such factor. Others include heredity, skin 
type, and our general facial skeletal structure. 
However, other factors are within our control. These include exposure to 
sunlight, which you mention, as well as tobacco and alcohol use. In general, I 
believe that the greatest contribution to good looks is good health.
