FT  18 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Life assurance: the wrongs and rights
(1)
Sir, It is astonishing that life assurance offices should respond to Peter
Marsh's investigative journalism ('When he dies my dear, all this will be
yours', June 11/12) with cries of the industry being the subject of a press
vendetta.
It is not the press which imposed the recent array of fines on many leading
life companies for contravening the regulations, designed to protect
consumers; nor is it the press which suspended the entire Norwich Union
direct salesforce; nor did financial journalists invent the home income
scandal, the personal pensions scandal or the statistics showing that one
third of life policies lapse within two years.
It is the life assurance industry itself which has, by its unprincipled
disregard for the best interests of the public, earned its present appalling
reputation. An expression of deep regret and a promise of urgent reform
would have been the more appropriate response.
The public has reason to be grateful to financial journalists for their
incisive reportage, which has stirred the regulators into taking a measure
of effective action to protect consumers against the activities of many life
companies.
As a result, standards are beginning to improve but there is a very long way
to go. Financial journalists can make a further contribution to speeding up
the process by raising the question of accountability. Clearly it is the
directors and management of life offices that should be held accountable for
their companies' selling malpractices, rather than the individual sales
people.
The long-awaited change in regulation will begin with miraculous speed on
the day the regulators take public action against chief executives of life
offices which blatantly disregard their regulations.
