 

There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. During the period 19962025, these savings
are calculated to be 17.0 quads of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on the environment
by reducing the emissions of NO

2

 and SO

2

 by 2,739,000 tons and 2,986,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 1.47 percent each by the year 2030. Furthermore,
the standard will reduce emissions of CO

2

 by 1,450 million tons, or 1.44 percent, over the forecast period. The technologies that are necessary to meet this
standard are presently available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The consumer payback
of this standard level is 2.4 years for the representative class and no more than 5.3 years for any class. This standard
has the lowest life-cycle cost for all classes and is expected to result in a reduction in life-cycle cost of approximately
$30 for the representative class. Additionally, the standard is expected to increase both the short- and long-run
prototypical manufacturer's return on equity of 15.5 percent. Since this standard does not involve substantial
redesign or retooling, the Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller competitors. 

h. Television Sets 

1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed

The Department examined a range of standard levels for color television sets. Table 417 presents the efficiency
levels that have been selected for analysis. Level 3 corresponds to the highest efficiency level, max tech, considered
in the engineering analysis. For level 3, the annual energy use in kWh per year can be expressed as E=20.5+6.1D, where
D equals the screen size in inches.

Trial standard level 1 accomplishes the above efficiency improvement from the baseline by reducing standby power
usage to 2 watts; level 2 corresponds to an efficiency achieved by reducing standby power to 2 watts and by reducing
the white and black screen power each by 6 watts; level 3 corresponds to an efficiency achieved by reducing the standby
power to two watts, white screen power to 73 watts and black screen power to 41 watts. 

2. Payback Period


Table 418 presents the payback period for the efficiency levels analyzed for 19
&rsquo;
&rsquo;/20
&rsquo;
&rsquo; color television sets. Standard levels 1 and 2 satisfy the rebuttable presumption test, i.e., the additional
price of purchasing a product will be less than three times the value of the energy savings that the consumer will receive
during the first year.

3. Significance of Energy Savings. 

To estimate the energy savings by the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new television
sets under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of those sold under the candidate standard levels. For
the candidate energy conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy Model projects
that over the period 1996
2030, the following energy savings would result for each: 


Level 1_0.52 Quad Level 2_1.28 Quads Level 3_3.13 Quads

 
The Department finds that each of the increased standards levels considered above would result in a significant conservation
of energy. 

4. Economic Justification



A. Economic impact on manufacturers and consumers.

 The per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the level 1 efficiency is $2.15; to meet levels 2 and 3 the manufacturers'
cost increases are $3.65 and $10.25, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 1.4. At those levels of
efficiency, the incremental consumer price increases are $3.76, $6.39 and $19.37 for standard levels 1
3, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy
expense) at level 1 is $1.81, standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $2.95 and standard level 3 by $5.71. See
Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for
television sets show that the prototypical manufacturer has a negative return on equity of 1.9 percent in the absence
of standards and that standards cause slight but further reductions in both short- and long-run return on equity.
Standard levels 1 through 3 are projected to produce negative short-run return on equitys of 2.0 percent, 2.0 percent
and 3.3 percent, respectively. Long-run return on equitys are projected to be negative 1.9 percent, 2.0 percent and
2.2 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and 5.2. Most financial data of the type needed
to characterize the prototypical manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are subsidiaries
or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that the prototypical firm has largely the same financial
characteristics (e.g. debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial data for the parent
firms are based on publicly available sources such as Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company
annual reports.
