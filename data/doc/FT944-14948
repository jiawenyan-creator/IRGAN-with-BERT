FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Lotus places blame for 60%
decline on European operations
Lotus Development has reported a sharp drop in earnings for the third
quarter. The US personal computer software company blamed problems in its
European operations for the reversal.
Net income before non-recurring charges was Dollars 7.3m, or 15 cents a
share, 60 per cent down on Dollars 18.3m, or 41 cents, in the same period
last year. Revenue for the quarter was Dollars 235.2m, a 2 per cent decline
from Dollars 240.1m in last year's third quarter.
Lotus took charges of Dollars 67.9m for the acquisition of SoftSwitch and
Edge Research, two software development groups, during the quarter. The
company also took a Dollars 9m charge for restructuring its European
operations. The net loss for the quarter, after charges, was Dollars 66.4m,
or Dollars 1.39 a share.
'Third-quarter results proved disappointing, primarily due to poor
performance of our European operations,' said Mr Jim Manzi, president and
chief executive officer. He also cited slower than expected sales through a
volume purchase programme for corporate customers.
The problems in Europe stemmed from slow demand for Lotus' office PC
applications programs and a management shuffle, said Mr Edwin Gillis, chief
financial officer. During the period Lotus appointed a new manager of its
European operations and cut about 90 jobs, he added. New products, launched
in September, were expected to boost demand, he said.
Revenues from communications programs, used for electronic messaging, now
account for about one-third of revenues and sales of these products grew 72
per cent, year on year.
Net losses, after charges, for the year to date were Dollars 35.3m, or 76
cents a share, compared with net income after charges of Dollars 25.9m, or
59 cents, in the first nine months of 1993.
