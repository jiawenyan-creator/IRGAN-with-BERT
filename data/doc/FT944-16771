FT  12 OCT 94 / Tax pledge given for classic cars
Dr Brian Mawhinney, trans-port secretary, yesterday reassured owners of
classic and vintage vehicles that he would not order a much criticised
extension of vehicle excise duty without public consultation.
Owners of seasonally used vehicles or those off the road while being
restored had expressed concern about proposed measures to cut the Pounds
145m annual cost of evasion.
In July the Department of Transport announced that it planned to require
that cars and motorcycles have a current tax disc at all times, regardless
of whether they were in use.
Dr Mawhinney said: 'I am very aware of the fears voiced by owners of classic
and vintage vehicles and am looking at what sensible arrangements can be
made to cover those kind of concerns.'
