  [Text] Prague, June 22 (CTK) -- The government today 
approved a Czech-Slovak agreement on support for and mutual 
protection of investments, Deputy Premier Ivan Kocarnik told 
journalists. 
  The text, which had been approved by the Slovaks, includes 
provisions reflecting the fact that both states used to be 
members of a federation, Kocarnik said. 
  The agreement was first drawn up before the split but has 
never been approved in parliament.
