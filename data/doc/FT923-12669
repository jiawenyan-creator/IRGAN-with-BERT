FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (26): New Peps
triggered by the Budget - A guide to the information about trusts that is
published each day in the FT / Investment Trusts
THE BUDGET change in personal equity plan (Pep) rules has provided a boost
for most of the investment trust industry. Now that a full Pounds 6,000 can
be invested in an existing investment trust, the sector can compete even
harder in the savings market, writes Philip Coggan.
River &amp; Mercantile, the split-capital trust specialists, launched three
packaged Peps to try to take advantage of the new Pounds 6,000 limit. The
plans were constructed to meet different investor needs - high income,
capital growth and income &amp; growth - by investing in different combinations
of split shares.
The capital growth plan, for example, invests in a combination of stepped
preference and capital shares. The yield on the stepped preference shares
covers the plan charges; the capital shares will provide growth if the
assets of the trusts rise.
No doubt plan managers will be able to construct ever more ingenious ways of
meeting investors' specific requirements. But it still seems a shame that
one of the most stable and diversified sectors - the international general
trusts - are excluded from the Pounds 6,000 limit.
Trusts still need to keep at least 50 per cent of their assets in EC markets
to qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 limit. Some generalists, such as
Foreign &amp; Colonial, will not commit themselves to meet this requirement;
they want the flexibility to invest in other markets as opportunity
dictates. That means that an investment in such a trust is limited to Pounds
1,500. It seems a strange regime that allows investors to put a full Pounds
6,000 in a specialist sector such as, say, German smaller companies but not
in an internationally diversified trust.
