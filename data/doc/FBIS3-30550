  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Feb 6 (AFP) -- UN special envoy to 
ex- Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi and UNPROFOR commander General 
Jean Cot visited the Sarajevo market Sunday where 66 people died 
in a mortar attack, as preparations were underway to evacuate 
some of the wounded. 
  Akashi and Cot were escorted to the site of Saturday's 
massacre, the worst single attack since the siege of the Bosnian 
capital began 22 months ago, by Sarajevo Mayor Muhamed 
Kresevljakovic and Bosnian Interior Minister Bakir Alispahic. 
  They were to meet with Bosnian leaders Sunday before heading 
back to Zagreb later in the afternoon. 
  Akashi said an investigation was underway to determine who 
had fired the shell that slammed into the crowded market, 
killing 66 and injuring 197, many of whom are not expected to 
survive because of the gravity of their wounds. She said 
although there were assumptions as to who was responsible, no 
final conclusions could yet be drawn. 
  The UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) said in a statement 
Saturday that it had "confirmed that the explosion was caused by 
a single, 120 mm mortar bomb fired from northeast of the 
market." But UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman said the 
investigation was difficult as the shell first hit a tower 
without fully exploding and then crashed into the market.
