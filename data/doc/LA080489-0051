THE STATE; 
AF PILOT GETS JAIL FOR BIGAMY 
An Air Force officer panel in San Francisco sentenced a veteran pilot to three 
months in a military jail and dismissal from the service for his conviction on 
bigamy charges. The panel ruled that Capt. Neil Clark must also give up three 
months' pay, amounting to $8,600. In addition, because his dismissal will come 
nine months shy of 20 years' service, Clark will lose his retirement benefits 
and pension. Clark's attorneys contend that he was so driven by lust that he 
entered into a bigamous marriage with an English woman in order to have sex 
with her. Testimony indicated that the woman wanted to marry a U.S. citizen to 
remain in this country.
