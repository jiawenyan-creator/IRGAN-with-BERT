$40-MILLION BUTTERFIELD CASE; 
S&amp;L INSURER TO PAY FSLIC $5 MILLION IN DAMAGE SUIT 
The liability insurer for two top former Butterfield Savings &amp; Loan 
executives has agreed to pay $5 million to the Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corp. to settle the agency's $40-million damage suit against the 
pair, Donald and David Endresen. 
The FSLIC spent more than $281 million trying to unravel Santa Ana-based 
Butterfield's problems after the S&amp;L was declared insolvent and seized by 
government regulators in 1985. 
The agency originally filed the damage suit against former Butterfield 
president Donald Endresen; his father, David, who was chairman of the company; 
his brother, William, a vice president; four other individuals, and Butterfield 
Equities Corp., the Endresen-controlled holding company that owned the S&amp;L. 
The other defendants had already either settled for smaller amounts or, in the 
case of William Endresen and Butterfield Equities, had filed for bankruptcy 
protection. 
The settlement on behalf of the Endresens was agreed to by Harbor Insurance Co. 
of New York, which had carried liability insurance on Butterfield's executives. 
Under the settlement, neither Endresen admitted wrongdoing, their attorney 
said. 
An attorney for the FSLIC said a trial is pending in a separate civil action 
seeking $40 million in damages from a group of businessmen in Washington and 
Oregon who sold real estate properties to Butterfield under what the FSLIC 
alleges were questionable circumstances. 
Butterfield, which once was one of the fastest-growing S&amp;Ls in the state, 
was operated under a government-sponsored management program from the time it 
was seized until it was sold to Downey S&amp;L of Newport Beach last year.
