FT  15 JAN 92 / India's external deficit falls as trade levels diminish
INDIA'S trade deficit declined sharply to Dollars 1.34bn (Pounds 740m)
between April and September 1991, compared to Dollars 3.04bn in the same six
months of the previous financial year, according to half-yearly figures
released by the Indian government yesterday.
But the figures are deceptive since they reflect a substantial reduction in
imports because of balance of payments difficulties and diminishing foreign
exchange reserves. Exports have, in fact, declined by more than 6 per cent.
Imports fell by 17.5 per cent to Dollars 11bn in the period compared to more
than Dollars 13bn in the same period last year. Import restrictions have
held back industrial production owing to scarcity of raw materials,
components and capital goods.
Some economists even fear that the economy is in the grip of a recession
because of the import cuts. Industrialists have been urging the government
to withdraw the restrictions but, despite a marked improvement in the
foreign exchange reserves which stand at present at over Rs95bn (Pounds
2.1bn), the government has not responded positively.
The trade figures have been presented in a new format to differentiate
between hard currency areas and rupee payment areas (Russia and some east
European countries). They show that exports to hard currency areas rose in
the six-month period by 5.6 per cent and fell by 54 per cent to rupee
payment areas.
The object of the new format is to show that hard currency earnings are
increasing and that the drop in earnings from eastern Europe (which involve
barter arrangements) do not matter since hard currency is not involved.
Nevertheless, overall export performance is dismal.
