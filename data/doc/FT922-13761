FT  09 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen moves to centre stage
THE YEN took centre stage in London yesterday, as another steep fall in
Tokyo stocks prompted worries that Japanese banks would repatriate their
money to prop up weakened balance sheets, writes Emma Tucker.
The Nikkei's further 616-point drop in Tokyo prompted the market to dwell on
three scenarios: that Japanese investors would move funds abroad; that
foreign investors would move out of yen; that Japanese institutions would
bring their money home. The last argument dominated.
A US bank trader said: 'Repatriation has been the buzz-word all day and it
has shaken a lot of people out of long mark/yen positions.'
A modest dollar rally in the morning was stopped when Wall Street opened. An
early 50-point slide by the Dow Industrial Average, on top of Tuesday's
62-point plunge, was just another factor making investors nervous about
holding US assets - they are already worried about faltering Tokyo stock
prices, a feeble US recovery and political concern in Europe.
By mid-afternoon the dollar stood at DM1.6255/65 after a DM1.6220/30 finish
in Asia and at Y132.25/32 from Y132.32/39. It closed in London at DM1.6255.
Later in New York it ended at DM1.6274/79 and Y132.68/75.
Mr Steven Barrow, an analyst at Chemical Bank in London, said no clear trend
for the dollar emerged yesterday. 'The market is still unclear about the US
recovery and what sort of momentum it has.'
Meanwhile, sterling continued to look perky against the D-Mark in the face
of political uncertainty. Rumours that an NOP poll would put the
Conservatives 3 points ahead of the Labour party swept through the markets
in the morning, buoying the UK currency even though the findings could not
be confirmed until the evening.
'It was an obviously silly rumour, but perhaps it helped pull the pound up a
bit,' said one analyst.
The UK currency opened at DM2.8392, rose to a high of DM2.8454 in late
trading and closed at DM2.8425. Against the dollar it was static at the
Dollars 1.75 level for most of the session.
The escudo, still a very volatile currency, ended its third day in the ERM
on a softer note at 86.07/12 to the D-Mark, from 85.70/75 on Wednesday
night. Traders said the slip may have helped sterling.
An analyst commented: 'Perhaps the market was anxious that the escudo could
put pressure on sterling by rising strongly within the EMS, but that has not
happened.'
It remained the EMS grid's second highest currency, after the Spanish
peseta, but slipped to 4.69 per cent above its pivot rate against sterling
from 5.27 per cent.
In spite of its gains elsewhere, the pound ended against the Spanish
currency at Pta180.58/62, the lowest level permitted by the ERM.
