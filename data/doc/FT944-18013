FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Accountants face lawsuit over
Carrian
Price Waterhouse Hong Kong is being sued for HKDollars 2bn (USDollars 259m)
by liquidators of Carrian Investment, the conglomerate placed in liquidation
in October 1983 with debts of HKDollars 10bn.
The collapse of Carrian, a property and shipping group that under the
chairmanship of Mr George Tan grew to become one of Hong Kong's most
prominent companies, was the subject of a HKDollars 100m investigation by
the Hong Kong government.
A High Court case, brought by liquidators Ernst &amp; Young Hong Kong, opened in
the colony this week and is expected to continue for up to nine months. The
accountants are accused of professional negligence in failing to expose
fraud within the group.
Specifically, they face accusations that they were negligent in five
assignments for Carrian - three times as auditor and twice as reporting
accountant between 1980 and 1982. Price Waterhouse HK said it would be
mounting a 'robust and vigorous defence'.
After the 1983 collapse, Price Waterhouse accountants Mr David Begg and Mr
Anthony Lo faced charges of conspiring to defraud by making false and
misleading statements. They were acquitted in 1984.
