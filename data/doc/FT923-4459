FT  07 SEP 92 / The Farnborough Air Show: Western carrier may buy Russian
cargo aircraft
INQUIRIES ABOUT possible purchases of the Tupolev Tu 204-200, a new Russian
aircraft powered by Rolls-Royce engines, have been received from at least
one western carrier. It is understood to be Federal Express, the US air
cargo specialist.
The aircraft, being shown in the UK for the first time at Farnborough, is
made and sold by the British Russian Aviation Corporation (Bravia) which is
50 per cent owned by Flemings Russian Investment, part of the Robert Fleming
investment group, 25 per cent by Aviastar, a Russian airframe manufacturer
privatised last year, and 25 per cent by the Tupolev Design Bureau.
Rolls-Royce is supplying its RB211-535 engine for the aircraft.
Mr Valentin Klimov, general director of Tupolev Design Bureau, said that
Bravia aimed to sell the 204-200 at between 20 per cent and 30 per cent less
than the Boeing 757, which typically costs between Dollars 50m (Pounds
25.1m) and Dollars 60m.
Mr Phil Condit, the new president of Boeing, said the company was prepared
to compete with any Russian competitors on price.
A price war between the two aircraft makers is, however, only a remote
possibility because the Tu 204-200 has yet to undergo rigorous certification
by the world's aviation authorities.
If Federal Express buys the 204-200, it will be a cargo derivative capable
of lifting 30 tonnes of freight. Certification for use as a cargo aircraft
is less stringent than for passenger aircraft.
