FT  20 MAR 93 / International Company News: Singer to take control of rival
sewing-machine group
SINGER, one of the world's leading sewing-machine makers, is to take control
of Pfaff, its German rival.
Mr Wolfgang Schuppli, Pfaff's largest single shareholder and chairman of its
supervisory board, has agreed to sell his 29 per cent stake to Singer's
parent, Semi-Tech Global. Before the transfer of his holding, Semi-Tech will
acquire an initial 22 per cent through bilateral negotiations with other
stock-holders, Pfaff said yesterday.
No details were given of the price to be paid for the targeted 51 per cent
stake. The deal, supported by the German company's board and now under
examination by the cartel authorities in Berlin, is expected to be concluded
later this year.
The two brands are estimated to command an overall 20 per cent market share
in Germany.
Pfaff, the world's second-biggest industrial sewing-machine maker after Juky
of Japan, has run into difficulties following the collapse of its markets in
eastern Europe.
In 1991 it lost DM18m (Dollars 10.9m) on sales of DM1bn. The books have not
yet been closed on 1992, but turnover fell by 5 per cent during the year and
profits had not improved, according to Pfaff. The group's household machines
business, which accounts for 25 per cent of sales, is still profitable.
Semi-Tech Global, part of the Canadian Semi-Tech International group which
also owns the Japanese Sansui Electric company, is listed on the Hong Kong
stock exchange. The group has annual sales of more than Dollars 2bn. It took
a 51 per cent stake in Singer, a household machine specialist, in 1988 and
has since steered it out of difficulties with continuing increases in sales
and profits, according to Pfaff.
The Pfaff brand will remain, but the implications for its 6,700 workers are
unclear. The agreement announced yesterday followed talks on a co-operation
deal under which Singer was to supply Pfaff with cheaper components from its
far eastern plants.
