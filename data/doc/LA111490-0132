SEAL BEACH ORDERS INITIATIVE TO RIVAL ONE BACKED BY MOLA 
The City Council on Tuesday night ordered a committee to draw up a ballot 
measure to rival one sponsored by Mola Development Corp., which for years has 
been trying to build a $200-million housing development on the old Hellman 
Ranch property. 
The rival measure was supported by council members Gwen Forsythe, Marilyn Bruce 
Hastings and Frank Laszlo, the three who voted down Mola's most recent proposal 
in June for building 329 homes on the 149-acre property. 
"I would like to see the people have a choice," Hastings said. 
Supporters of the Mola-backed measure are gathering signatures on behalf of a 
proposal that would let voters decide whether the project as proposed by the 
developer should be built. 
Councilman Joe Hunt and Mayor Edna Wilson criticized the rival measure. "I 
believe that another initiative would just cloud the issue," Wilson said. 
The Hellman Specific Plan Committee, made up of 15 residents, has until Dec. 1 
to come up with an alternative to Mola's measure.
