FT  03 JUL 93 / Minister urges two pensions for all
THE GOVERNMENT should be aiming to ensure that 'practically everyone' has a
second pension on top of the basic state retirement pension scheme, a
cabinet minister urged yesterday, David Owen writes.
Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, said he expected most pensioners to be
enjoying good living standards in 30 to 40 years' time 'primarily because
they have saved for their retirement during their years of earning'.
By helping to bring this about, he suggested, the government would be able
to continue uprating the state pension in line with prices rather than
earnings.
The cost of financing the basic state retirement pension could be contained
further by equalising the retirement age for men and women upwards 'as
people are likely to live longer and have healthier lives'.
