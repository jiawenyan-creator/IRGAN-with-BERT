WINE OF THE WEEK AND BEST NOUVEAU OF THE YEAR 
1990 Quady Electra -- This low-alcohol (4%) wine from Andy Quady is 100% Orange 
Muscat with a hint of carbonation. 
You could drink three glasses and get the alcohol equivalent of just one. It's 
delicious -- sweet, but not too sweet. It's a grand experience -- at $9.50 a 
bottle.
