941010 Boeing: 

Amendment 398917. Docket 93NM151AD. 






Applicability: 

Model 747100, 200, and 300 series airplanes; equipped with Pratt  Whitney JT9D series engines;
certificated in any category. 


Compliance: 

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
To prevent inadvertent engine fan thrust reverser deployment during flight, which could result in reduced controllability
of the airplane, accomplish the following: 
(a) Within 36 months after the effective date of this AD, modify the thrust reverser control system to include a solenoid-operated
shut-off valve in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747782052, Revision 4, dated March 23, 1989.







Note: 

Airplanes on which the modification has been accomplished previously in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin
747782052, Revision 3, dated August 27, 1987, are considered to be in compliance with this paragraph.





(b) As of 18 months after the effective date of this AD, no person shall install a Pratt  Whitney JT9D series engine
on any airplane unless the thrust reverser control system installed on that engine has been modified to include a solenoid-operated
shut-off valve in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747782052, Revision 4, dated March 23, 1989.





(c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane
Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector,
who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO. 






Note: 

Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Seattle ACO. 




(d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation
Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be
accomplished.
