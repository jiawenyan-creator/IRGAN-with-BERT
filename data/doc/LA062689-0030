FLORIDA GUN LAW 
How enlightened of the Florida legislature to consider a law recognizing that 
children don't kill children, guns kill children (to paraphrase the National 
Rifle Assn.'s favorite platitude) (Part I, June 16). How open-minded of the NRA 
to support that law in the face of almost certain passage. How stupid we all 
are, allowing the paranoid NRA to continually prevent reasonable firearm 
control. 
Too little, too late, Florida, for the five children and many others who have 
paid the price for our right to own "adult" toys.
