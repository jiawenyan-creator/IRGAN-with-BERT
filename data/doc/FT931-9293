FT  15 FEB 93 / Letter: More than just accountancy
Sir, Can you have quoted Mr Colquhoun, secretary of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, correctly ('Heseltine laments
oversupply of accountants', February 6) as saying that accountants control
many highly successful companies such as BTR, Glaxo and Grand Metropolitan?
Surely, highly successful companies are run by excellent directors and
managers, whether they be accountants, engineers or scientists. Sir Paul
Girolami, an accountant, made this very point most eloquently in an
interview reported in Director, November 1992: 'If I were to run Glaxo as an
accountant we wouldn't get started.'
Sir Paul is also a Fellow of the Institute of Management Consultants, yet
the last thing in my mind to assert is that Glaxo is controlled by a
management consultant. I do not doubt that Mr Colquhoun takes the same view
of accountants.
