FT  14 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report
New York COTTON futures tumbled in early afternoon dealings, scoring
successive lifetime lows. One Mississippi economist said Wednesday's USDA
crop report confirmed that US cotton had to seek lower prices if it is to
compete in the world market place. 'The explosion in world stocks makes this
very clear,' he said. The report showed 1992 production of 16.5m bales
compared to 16m last month. 'Most estimates were running about 15.8m to
15.9m, so this was a surprise to the market although not totally
unexpected,' said one broker. Most base metals ended below overnight levels
on the LME, although the presence of underlying support helped some move
away from their lows, particularly copper and zinc. Three-month COPPER met
support around Dollars 2,480 tonne, as expected, and recovered to end at
Dollars 2,486, still down Dollars 11 from Wednesday's kerb. London COCOA
closed well below its highs but held on to moderate gains as New York
rallied after Wednesday's sharp slide. 'No one can still find any
fundamental reason for the fall yesterday other than long speculative
liquidation, which we hope we've seen the last of,' one trader said.
