  [Text] Khartoum, June 13 ( XINHUA ) -- Melissa F. Wells, 
special envoy of U.S. President Bill Clinton, said she will meet 
with the rebel movement in Sudan in a bid to bring about a 
cease-fire in the southern part. 
  Following a meeting here today with Ali al-Haj [Mohamed], 
Sudanese minister of state in the Federal Government Chamber, 
Wells said her role concentrates on arranging a cease fire 
between the government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation 
Army (SPLA), Sudanese radio reported today. 
  The Sudanese minister said his government is ready to accept 
a cease fire if sincere and earnest steps are taken by the rebel 
side despite advances made by government troops on the battle 
ground. 
  Al-Haj asserted to the U.S. presidential envoy the lack of 
seriousness on the part of the rebel movement to negotiate 
peace, citing the delay of the rebel delegation to appear at the 
recent round of peace negotiations held in Nairobi. 
  He also praised the initiative made by the 
Inter-Governmental 
Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD) and its 
constructive role towards reaching peace in south Sudan. 
  The U.S. envoy arrived here last Saturday to push forward 
the 
peace efforts made by the IGADD, which groups Kenya, Uganda, 
Ethiopia, Eritrea and Sudan. 
  Sudan, which has a population of about 25 million, is split 
by conflicts between the Moslem-dominated government in the 
north and the Animist and Christian Church. 
  The SPLA led by John Garang has been fighting against the 
government since 1983, seeking more economic reforms in the 
south.
