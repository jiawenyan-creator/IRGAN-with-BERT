FT  14 MAR 94 / Labour wary of possible losses
Labour may lose 'scores of seats' in the May council elections, Mr Jack
Straw, shadow environment secretary, said yesterday. The party captured many
of the seats to be fought this year when they were last contested, and would
have to fight very hard to keep them all. His comments on BBC1's On the
Record came as a survey for the programme by the BBC's political research
unit showed Labour could suffer mixed results in England. It suggested that
Labour might capture about 140 seats from the Tories, but lose 50 others to
them. It said Labour might win about 10 seats from the Liberal Democrats,
but might lose as many as 150 to them.
