FT  23 AUG 93 / The Sun to keep lower price
which cut its price from 25p to 20p six weeks ago - will remain at the lower
price for the rest of the year because of sales increases.
The Sun, owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International media group, said
last night that its sales had risen 2.7 per cent year-on-year in July, which
included 12 days of the lower price.
The move by The Sun sparked a tabloid price war last month with the Daily
Mirror cutting its cover price to 10p for the first day of The Sun's price
reduction.
