FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Dobson Park Pounds 4.8m in the black
Dobson Park Industries, the industrial electronics and toys group which last
year merged its mining equipment business with a rival, yesterday reported
interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.81m compared with a Pounds 714,000 loss.
The results for the six months to April 2 were struck after a Pounds 498,000
profit on the sale of land and buildings while there was a Pounds 4.36m loss
last time on the disposal of the Power Tools and Revere Aerospace
businesses.
Turnover fell from Pounds 71.8m to Pounds 46.6m, but excluding discontinued
operations and mining equipment sales for the first quarter turnover was
marginally ahead of last time's Pounds 45.2m.
The group combined its mining equipment side with Meco International, a 1989
buy-out from the division of Dowty Group, in January last year to form
Longwall International.
Earnings per share of 2.49p compared with losses of 1.12p and the interim
dividend is maintained at 1.2p.
Commenting on the results, Mr Alan Kaye, chairman, said the improvement in
profits 'mainly resulted from the earlier substantial reorganisation
measures and the continued application of stringent operational controls'.
Operating profits fell to Pounds 2.65m (Pounds 4.09m), but a Pounds 1.84m
contribution from associates boosted net operating income to Pounds 4.49m
(Pounds 4.1m). Net interest costs were Pounds 181,000 (Pounds 454,000).
All divisions contributed to the improved performance. However, Mr Kaye said
that except for the improvement in the toys and plastics division, the group
had not benefited so far from improving economic conditions in the UK and
US.
The industrial electronics division lifted operating profits to Pounds 2.56m
(Pounds 2.18m) on flat turnover of Pounds 37.8m (Pounds 37.5m) while toys
and plastics contributed Pounds 525,000 (Pounds 254,000) on turnover of
Pounds 8.55m (Pounds 7.7m). The group's share of mining equipment profits
increased to Pounds 1.92m (Pounds 1.3m).
