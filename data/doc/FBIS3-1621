  [Text] Hefei, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The most promising 
economic growth area in the world is the Asian-Pacific region in 
the 21st century, and that in China is the Chang Jiang River 
valley, according to Chinese economists. 
  This was the consensus of opinion of noted economists from 
Beijing, Shanghai and seven provinces along the Chang Jiang 
River who gathered in this capital of Anhui Province to study 
the position, role in economic development and strategic 
objective of the valley. 
  The Chang Jiang River valley has a population of 450 million 
and its gross product accounts for 40 percent of the country's 
total. 
  According to the economists, the central government should 
continuously bring into play the role of the coastal areas in 
economic development while focusing on building economic belts 
along the Chang Jiang River Valley, which has a dense 
population, rich natural resources, convenient transportation 
facilities and a vast potential market. 
  The economists suggested that development of the Chang Jiang 
River valley should concentrate on Pudong, a newly-established 
economic zone that is expected to lead in the transformation of 
Shanghai's industrial and financial sectors, and then tap the 
advantages of localities so as to update the product mix.
