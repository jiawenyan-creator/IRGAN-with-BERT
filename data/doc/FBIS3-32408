  [Text] Brasilia -- The Cuban Government will sell Brazil 
$30 million in generic medicines that will arrive in the country 
between 30 and 60 days. This commercial agreement will be used 
to pay part of the Cuban debt with Brazil, which totals $48 
million. This was reported by Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage 
D'Avila, who is visiting Brazil to negotiate investment 
strategies in the country. 
  Lage met yesterday with President Itamar Franco and with 
Health Minister Henrique Santillo. Lage stated that Cuba is 
able to supply several medicines to Brazil at good prices. He 
said Cuba can sell Brazil generic medicines, like antibiotics 
and anesthetics. 
  Carlos Lage explained that the Cuban Government is 
"patiently" awaiting the Brazilian discussion over the 
effectiveness of the antimeningitis meningococcic B-type vaccine 
produced in Cuba. "We are aware this issue is being thoroughly 
discussed in Brazil but I would like to remind everyone that we 
are the scientific proof of the vaccine's effectiveness."
