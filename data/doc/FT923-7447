FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: Banks agree aid for Nippon
Housing Loan
NIPPON Housing Loan, Japan's home loan company, yesterday announced its nine
leading creditor banks had agreed to provide financial assistance for its
restructuring programme.
Nippon Housing Loan, facing mounting property-related debts, had been in
dispute with its creditors who were opposed to the company's requests to
reduce the interest rate on its loans.
The nine banks which fund Nippon Housing have now agreed to lower the
interest rate to 3.25 per cent, the same as the official discount rate, and
maintain their outstanding lending levels.
The banks, including Sakura Bank and Sanwa Bank, have extended Y600bn
(Dollars 4.75bn) to Nippon Housing Loan, which holds an estimated Y2,300bn
in total debt.
Reports of the deal were greeted on the Tokyo stock market with relief, as
Nippon Housing Loan's shares, which had plunged on concerns over the
financial stability of the company, rose Y22 to Y140.
However, the banks are concerned over the reluctance of Nippon Housing
Loan's remaining creditors to co-operate with the company's restructuring.
Financial affiliates of agricultural co-operatives lead by Norinchukin Bank
have around 40 per cent of loans to Nippon Housing Loan.
Seven Japanese housing loan companies have sought financial assistance from
their leading banks.
The companies were set up during the 1960s and 1970s by leading financial
institutions to provide property loans for individuals. However, the bulk of
the loans and investments, made to riskier resort and property developments
in the 1980s, have since turned sour.
The problems at Japanese non-bank financial institutions, including the home
loan companies, are expected to put pressure on Japanese banks which have
been forced to accept reduced or even no interest payments.
