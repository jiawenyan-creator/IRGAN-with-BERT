BELLA LEWITZKY AND THE NEA 
What sanctimonious drivel coming from the lips of Lewitzky! I for one (but I am 
certainly not alone in this) say to her: "Go ahead and keep your pious hands 
off public tax monies!" 
What people like Lewitzky and Michael Hudson of the (misnamed) People of the 
American Way fail to realize is that the proposed NEA restrictions now being 
considered by Congress in no way trample on anyone's First Amendment rights!
