FT  21 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Malaysia extends telecoms time
Malaysia has granted a six-month extension to three foreign-led
telecommunications groups to comply with the terms of a MDollars 2bn (Pounds
470m) telecommunications contract awarded earlier this year, writes Kieran
Cooke from Kuala Lumpur. The three groups, led by Fujitsu of Japan, Nokia of
Finland and Alcatel/CIT of France, have been granted the extension to ensure
their equipment is fully compatible with each other's systems and with
existing ones installed in Malaysia by NEC of Japan and Ericsson of Sweden.
