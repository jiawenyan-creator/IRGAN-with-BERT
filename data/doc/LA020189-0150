CHRYSLER TO SELL HYUNDAIS IN U.S. BEGINNING IN 1991 
Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea's biggest auto maker, will sell 30,000 autos a 
year in the United States through Chrysler Corp. beginning in 1991, a Hyundai 
spokesman said today. 
Hyundai will sell, through Chrysler's Eagle Division, a four-door sedan with a 
2,400-cubic centimeter engine that will be assembled at Hyundai's newly opened 
plant in Bromont, Quebec. 
Hyundai has not decided yet whether the model will be the Sonata, currently on 
sale in the United States, or a completely new model. 
Hyundai's Canadian plant, the first Korean auto assembly plant outside Korea, 
has been producing Sonatas since Jan. 13 and will produce about 30,000 Sonatas 
this year. 
The capacity will increase to 100,000 units by 1991. About 50,000 autos will be 
sold in the United States directly by Garden Grove-based Hyundai Motor America 
and 20,000 units will be sold in Canada. 
With the alliance between Hyundai and Chrysler, all three major South Korean 
auto makers will be teamed up with the Big Three U.S. auto makers. Daewoo Motor 
is 50% owned by General Motors Corp. and Kia Motors is 10% owned by Ford Motor 
Co. 
GM's Pontiac Division now markets Daewoo's LeMans in the United States.
