FT  30 NOV 94 / Anti-war activist Rubin dies
Former 1960s activist Jerry Rubin died from a heart attack at the age of 56
in Los Angeles, two weeks after being struck by a car and critically
injured. Mr Rubin was a founder of the Youth International Party, known as
the Yippies, whose members played a major part in the bloody anti-Vietnam
War demonstrations outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in
August 1968.
He became a household name across America when he was charged, along with
seven others including the late Abbie Hoffman and black activist leader
Bobby Seale, with conspiracy to incite violence at the Chicago convention.
Conspiracy charges against the group were eventually dropped and the group
of anti-Vietnam war protesters were convicted on lesser charges that were
later quashed on appeal. Reuter,
