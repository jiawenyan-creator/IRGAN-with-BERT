FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Northumbrian share deals suspended
SHARES IN Northumbrian Fine Foods, the biscuit and snacks group, were
suspended at the company's request on the USM yesterday as speculation
mounted about the meaning of a statement issued late on Wednesday which
referred to a group reorganisation.
Northumbrian said then it was in discussions which 'are expected to have a
material effect on the group's interim results for the six months to
September 30'. These results were due to be released on Wednesday, but have
been postponed pending conclusion of the discussions.
Northumbrian said it hopes to make a further announcement shortly. There has
been speculation the company is in discussions with its bankers, and is
trying to sell a subsidiary to reduce debt, which stood at Pounds 5.82m at
March 31 last year.
The shares were suspended mid-morning after falling 2p to 17p.
