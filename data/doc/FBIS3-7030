  [Text] According to reports from Seoul, on 22 March, 
traitor Kim Yong-sam, who is madly engaged in war provocation 
maneuvers against the North [pukchim chonjaeng tobal chaektonge 
michyo nalttwigoinun], ordered the entire puppet armed forces to 
be put on alert [chonche kwoeroegun muryogi kyonggye taese-e 
turogalgosul chiryonghaessumnida]. The traitor called together 
the puppet defense minister, the chairman of the puppet Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, and the chiefs of the General Staff of the 
puppet Army, Navy, and Air Force in the presidential office to 
hold secret talks that day. He gave the above order while 
asking them to completely prepare for a northward invasion under 
the so-called cooperation system with the United States. 
  Prior to this, on 21 March, the traitor called a 
security-related ministers meeting at the presidential office to 
discuss a secrete scheme to invite outside forces to apply 
sanctions against the North [taebuk cheje-e oeserul kkuroduril 
kkung-kkung-irul kkumyossumnida]. 
  Meanwhile, the Joint Chiefs of Staff Headquarters ordered 
the 
entire puppet military forces to be on special alert on 23 
March. Accordingly, all puppet military officers and men are 
confined to their barracks, and all military officers have 
assumed a stand-by posture. 
  On 23 March, the U.S. ambassador to Seoul, the commander of 
the U.S. occupation forces in South Korea, the puppet defense 
minister, and the puppet foreign minister held a meeting in 
Seoul to plot a war conspiracy for northward invasion [pukchim 
chonjaeng moui]. According to reports, they intensively 
discussed the issue of introducing Patriot missiles in South 
Korea and resuming the Team Spirit joint military exercise, 
schemed about double-checking the South Korea-based U.S. 
occupation forces and the puppet armed forces readiness in war 
preparations [chongjaeng chunbi taeseul chaejomgom]. 
  The rascals' insane [mumohan] maneuvers are driving the 
situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war 
[chosonbandoui chongsenun chonjaeng chopkyongero chidaggo 
issumnida].
