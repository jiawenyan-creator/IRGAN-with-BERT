UCLA pitcher Dave Zancanaro, the 34th player chosen overall in last week's 
amateur draft, signed a contract with the Oakland Athletics and will report 
Monday to the organization's Medford (Ore.) affiliate in the Class-A Northwest 
League. 
Zancanaro, a junior left-hander who was 11-6 with a 3.20 earned-run average 
last season, was selected by the A's between the first and second rounds as 
compensation for the loss of free agent Storm Davis. Zancanaro said he received 
a $120,000 bonus.
