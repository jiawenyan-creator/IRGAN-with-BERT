FT  03 SEP 93 / Technology: Pen computers pick up tool kit - Worth Watching
Pen-based computers, where a stylus rather than a keyboard is used to enter
data, look set to bring computing to jobs outside the office, especially for
completing forms. German software house Padcom is now developing a tool kit,
PadForm, to enable standard forms to be more easily created.
Much of Padcom's work to date has centred on forms for the pharmaceutical
and clinical research organisations. Padcom: Germany, 228 628084; US: 212
