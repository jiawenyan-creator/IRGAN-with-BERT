Defending Iditarod champion Joe Runyan was the first to reach Ophir, Alaska, 
after a moose knocked four-time winner Rick Swenson out of the lead in the 
Alaskan dog-sled races. 
Runyan reached Ophir, a Gold Rush-era ghost town on the Innoko River 476 miles 
from Anchorage, 36 minutes ahead of Lavon Barve and 44 minutes ahead of Martin 
Buser. 
Swenson had left McGrath, a checkpoint 61 miles back on the trail, several 
hours before the others but turned around after a run-in with the moose, which 
trampled some of his dogs. 
A sled dog injured in the encounter was checked by a veterinarian who 
pronounced it fit to go on.
