FT  06 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Quadrilateral talks continue to the last
minute
TRADE officials of the US, Japan, Canada and the European Community were
last night locked in negotiations in a last-minute effort to agree a broad
market access deal for goods and services, aimed at reviving the stalled
Uruguay Round of trade talks.
The official-level talks are to be followed by a trade ministers' meeting of
the four today at which participants hope to agree a package and approve a
report to present to the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo tomorrow.
However, considerable differences still existed, making it necessary to
extend the official-level talks until the eve of the ministers' meeting.
The final trade ministers' meeting before the summit comes after the four
failed to agree a market access package at a ministers' meeting in Tokyo
less than two weeks ago.
At that time, US reluctance to reduce tariffs on textiles sufficiently to
satisfy other members, Japan's refusal to do the same for spirits and wood
products, and the EC's position on electronics were seen as big obstacles to
a wide-ranging package.
Failure to reach agreement on a market access package would endanger hopes
of concluding the long-stalled Uruguay Round this year.
Mr Peter Sutherland, the new director general of Gatt, has called the G7
summit in Tokyo a 'crucial catalyst' for rescuing the stalled round.
Officials in Tokyo were, however, cautious about the prospects for reaching
agreement so late in the day. Whatever progress is made will be made
hereafter, said one official yesterday.
