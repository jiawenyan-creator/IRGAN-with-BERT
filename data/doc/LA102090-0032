NO ROOM FOR BARD 
I say C.M. Jerks is right ("I Say Throw Those Grove Bums Out," Oct. 12). We 
don't want any Shakespeare plays here, attacking our value system, trying to 
reach down into the wellsprings of our being, and tap that emotional core, that 
spirit of humanity, that we have long covered up. 
It's subversive, that's what it is. A threat to our comfort and peace. Leave us 
to our manicured lawns, our well-furnished homes, our small businesses, our 
civic duties. We are proud of our well-run town. We certainly don't need this 
long-dead provincial poet from England to tell us what life is all about. We 
already know. 
I say, along with C.M. Jerks, take the plays elsewhere, to a community more in 
need.
