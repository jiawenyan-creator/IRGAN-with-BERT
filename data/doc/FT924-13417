FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: BNZ forced to make takeover
disclosures
DISSIDENT shareholders have forced Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) to hold an
extraordinary meeting to give further details of its financial affairs and
of National Australia Bank's NZDollars 1.5bn (Dollars 816m) takeover bid.
On two occasions, BNZ has secured waivers from the New Zealand Stock
Exchange to call such a meeting. However, the dissidents are now forcing BNZ
to call the meeting under its articles of association and section 136 of the
New Zealand Companies Act.
The dissidents - including two US shareholders with a combined 3 per cent
holding - say NAB's 80 cents-a-share offer is too low at a time when BNZ's
profitability appears to be improving. They have also criticised the level
of disclosure surrounding the takeover.
The dissidents are seeking, among others:
An explanation from BNZ of its restructuring following an independent report
by Baring Brothers Burrows, the UK-owned merchant bank, which said NAB's
offer was fair;
Details of Baring's brief when it was appointed independent adviser to the
offer; Disclosure of BNZ's first-half performance and future profitability.
Mr Syd Pasley, BNZ chairman, said yesterday the extraordinary meeting would
be held on October 30.
