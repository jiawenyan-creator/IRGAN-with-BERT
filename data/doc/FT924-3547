FT  07 DEC 92 / International Company News: Airline recovery helps Club Med
back into black
CLUB Mediterranee, one of the largest French leisure groups, returned to
profit last year following a recovery in its airline business.
The group, which has been expanding its cruise ship interests but is still
best known for its holiday villages, made net profits of FFr160m (Dollars
29.62m) in the year to October 31, against a loss of FFr17m in the previous
year.
However, Club Med did not perform as well as it had hoped, falling below the
FFr240m of net profits initially expected.
The shortfall was largely due to the poor performance of its US subsidiary,
which suffered an unexpectedly sharp fall in profits during the first nine
months of 1992.
The drop reflected higher costs and the US dollar's weakness against the
French franc.
Club Med yesterday attributed its return to profits in 1991-92 to reasonably
stable activity during the financial year.
It also managed to prevent the recurrence of the exceptional losses on its
airline activities that hit the previous year's results.
During that year Club Med, in common with other holiday companies, was badly
affected by the impact of the Gulf war on international travel.
The group said its winter trading had so far been relatively stable compared
with that of last year and there had been an improvement in the performance
of its US and Asian businesses.
Club Med is in the throes of a renovation and expansion programme and this
summer launched a FFr1bn bond issue to finance its plans.
