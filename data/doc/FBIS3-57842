  [Text] Greek Cypriot national guards opened fire at 
Turkish Cypriot positions today. Although there was no apparent 
reason for the shots, Turkish Cypriot soldiers did not respond 
thereby preventing a further exacerbation of the incident. 
  The shots were fired around 1120 [0920 GMT] at the positions 
situated near Madenlikoy [Ayios Yeoryios]. The Greek Cypriot 
national guards fired first one then two shots at the Turkish 
Cypriot positions. No one was hurt or injured in the incident. 
  The Turkish Cypriot security forces protested to the United 
Nations Forces in Cyprus.
