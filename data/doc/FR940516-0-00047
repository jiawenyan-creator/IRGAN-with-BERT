 

b. ``Digital computers'' not controlled by 4A03 having a ``composite theoretical performance'' (``CTP'') equal
to or greater than 
6 million theoretical operations per second (Mtops); 
c. ``Assemblies'' not controlled by 4A03 that are specially designed or modified to enhance performance by aggregation
of ``computing elements'' (``CEs''), as follows: 
c.1. Designed to be capable of aggregation in configurations of 16 or more ``computing elements'' (``CEs''); 

or 
c.2. Having a sum of maximum data rates on all channels available for connection to associated processors exceeding

40 million Bytes/s;

 




Note 1: 

4A94.c applies only to ``assemblies'' and programmable interconnections with a ``composite theoretical performance''
(``CTP'') not exceeding 12.5 million theoretical operations per second (Mtops), when shipped as unintegrated ``assemblies''.
It does not apply to ``assemblies'' inherently limited by nature of their design for use as related equipment controlled
by 4A03 or 4A94.

 



Note 2: 

4A94.c does not control any ``assembly'' specially designed for a product or family of products with a maximum configuration
that does not exceed a ``CTP'' of 
12.5 Mtops.

 

d. Disk drives and solid state storage equipment: 
d.1. Magnetic, erasable optical or magneto-optical disk drives with a ``maximum bit transfer rate'' exceeding 25
million bit/s; 
d.2. Solid state storage equipment, other than ``main storage'' (also known as solid state disks or RAM disks), with
a ``maximum bit transfer rate'' exceeding 36 million bit/s; 
e. Input/output control units designed for use with equipment controlled by 4A94.d; 
f. Equipment for ``signal processing'' or ``image enhancement'', not controlled by 4A03, having a ``composite theoretical
performance'' (``CTP'') exceeding 8.5 million theoretical operations per second (Mtops); 
g. Graphics accelerators or graphics coprocessors, not controlled by 4A03, that exceed a ``3D vector rate''
of 400,000 or, if supported by 2D vectors only, a ``2D vector rate'' of 600,000;

 



Note 1: 

The provisions of 4A94.g do not apply to work stations designed for and limited to: 
a. Graphic arts (e.g., printing, publishing); 

and 
b. The display of two-dimensional vectors.

 

h. Color displays or monitors having more than 120 resolvable elements per cm in the direction of the maximum pixel
density;

 



Note 1: 

4A94.h does not control displays or monitors not specially designed for electronic computers.





Note 2: 

Displays specially designed for air traffic control (ATC) systems are treated as specially designed components
for ATC systems under Category 6.

 

i. Equipment containing ``terminal interface equipment'' exceeding the limits in 5A91F.

 



Note: 

For the purposes of 4A94.h, ``terminal interface equipment'' includes ``local area network'' interfaces, modems
and other communications interfaces. ``Local area network'' interfaces are evaluated as ``network access controllers''.

 

38. In Supplement No. 1 to Section 799.1 (the Commerce Control List), Category 4 (Computers) is amended: 
a. By removing the sub-heading ``Equipment for the development and production of magnetic and optical storage equipment
as follows.'' immediately following the heading 
``B. Test, Inspection and Production Equipment'', which follows ECCN 4A96G; and 
b. By removing ECCNs 4B01A, 4B02A, and 4B03A; 
c. By adding a new ECCN 4B94F immediately following the heading ``B. Test, Inspection and Production Equipment'';
and 
d. By revising the heading of ECCN 4B96G to read as follows: 

 


4B94F 


Equipment for the ``development'' and ``production'' of magnetic and optical storage equipment, as described in
this entry.
