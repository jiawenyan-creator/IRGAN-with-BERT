FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Verity beats the drum with Premier deal
Verity Group, manufacturer of Wharfedale and Mission hi-fi speakers,
yesterday beat a path towards securing one of Britain's most prestigious
drum makers when it made a Pounds 1.85m agreed offer for Premier Percussion.
The move caused surprise in the drumming world as Premier was only bought by
its management from the Japanese group Yamaha two years ago. Verity said
yesterday that Mr Tony Doughty, the Premier chief executive, would receive
about Pounds 1.4m from the deal and join the Verity board as a non-executive
director.
Premier, famous for its name in front of a host of musical stars, including
Keith Moon of The Who, the Coldstream Guards and the Joe Loss Band, was
founded in 1928 and was family-owned until 1984. As well as its drums, the
group also makes other percussion instruments.
Mr Rick Van Horn, managing editor of Modern Drummer magazine, said the group
had suffered along with other traditional drum makers from the impact of
Japanese manufacturers in the 1980s, culminating in its purchase by Yamaha
in 1984. 'It's still one of the big names in drumming, particularly in the
UK and Europe,' he said.
He added that the Premiers' main endorsers - drummers whose equipment and
expen-ses are sponsored by the company - were Rod Morganstein of the Dixie
Dregs, Charlie Morgan of the Elton John band, Nicko McBrain of Iron Maiden
and Duane Perry of Jethro Tull.
The last audited accounts of the group show operating profits of Pounds
415,000 on turnover of Pounds 7.7m for the nine months to the end of
December, 1993.
Verity is raising Pounds 1.28m through a 1-for 12 rights issue of 17m shares
at 7.5p to pay for the purchase.
