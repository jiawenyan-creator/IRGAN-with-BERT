FT  10 DEC 92 / Mirror journalists condemn editor
JOURNALISTS at the Daily Mirror yesterday passed a motion expressing 'total
lack of confidence' in Mr David Banks, the editor appointed last month.
The vote follows the sacking of Mr John Hicks, the paper's Northern Ireland
correspondent, who had been with the paper for 16 years.
The paper said it would use agency reports to cover Northern Ireland.
