FT  04 OCT 94 / People: Marsh bounces back and finds home with Toyota
It has not taken long for motor trade veteran Alan Marsh to bounce back out
of his early retirement from Inchcape in May.
Marsh, 57, with 35 years experience of the car retailing scene, is becoming
the first non-Japanese board member of Toyota Motor Europe Marketing and
Engineering (TMME), the Brussels-based entity which controls most of the
Japanese car giant's European activities, except actual car making.
As vice-chairman of the TMME board, Marsh will be in direct charge of
Toyota's European marketing activities.
That makes it almost business as usual for Marsh. He is a past chairman of
Toyota (GB) and had been running Inchcape's Toyota vehicle distribution
businesses world-wide until the Inchcape board streamlining.
The appointment is an indication of Japan's largest car maker's commitment
to place the running of major regional operations in the hands of
non-Japanese managers. He is unlikely to be the last European board
appointment.
