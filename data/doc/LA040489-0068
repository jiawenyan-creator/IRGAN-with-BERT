EX-HEAD OF MEALS PROGRAM SENTENCED 
The former director of the La Mesa Nutrition Center was sentenced Monday to 13 
months in federal prison for defrauding the center out of more than $40,000. 
One of the sons of Jerrilyn Poitra, 46, of Chula Vista, ran from the courtroom 
in tears after hearing U. S. District Court Judge Leland Nielsen impose the 
sentence on his mother. 
Nielsen ordered her to repay the center, which runs a federally funded meals 
program for senior citizens, the total alleged loss: $42,193.12. 
Nielsen set payments at $200 a month, to begin after Poitra finishes her 
sentence. 
Poitra was director of the center for at least three years. In the 89-count 
indictment handed down Nov. 29, she was charged with making 87 Nutrition Center 
checks payable to herself. 
She pleaded guilty Jan. 10 to theft of public funds and to tax evasion on her 
1987 return, in which she failed to report the extra money as income. The other 
charges were then dismissed.
