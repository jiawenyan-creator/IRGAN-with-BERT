FT  30 MAR 93 / World Trade News: S Korea deal for Eni subsidiary
NUOVO Pignone, the Italian turbines and compressors manufacturer, has signed
a 10-year co-operation deal with South Korea's Halla Engineering and Heavy
Industries group, writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
The agreement will allow the South Korean company to manufacture under
licence Nuovo Pignone turbines of between 2MW and 10MW for the local market
and neighbouring countries. Some crucial parts will continue to be supplied
from Italy.
Among possible applications for the new turbines, used for driving
compressors or generating electricity, is a planned 4,500km natural gas
pipeline from Siberia to South Korea.
Nuovo Pignone, controlled by the Eni energy and chemicals state holding
company, is high on the government's privatisation list.
