Thailand will not repatriate two Burmese students who hijacked a plane with 83 
aboard to dramatize their demand for a return to democracy in their homeland, a 
Thai official said. Deputy Prime Minister Thienchai Sirisamphan, who persuaded 
the hijackers to surrender at the U Taphao air base, said, "We will not hurt 
them." Ye Tin, 21, and Ye Thi Ha, 25 -- authorities said their names may be 
pseudonyms -- hijacked a Fokker-28 over Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, and 
diverted it to Thailand, where nine hours of negotiations ended in their 
surrender.
