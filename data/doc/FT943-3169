FT  15 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Prudential
Prudential Corporation's figures contained a number of bright spots: the
group delivered an increase in profits from Jackson National Life, the US
subsidiary which had threatened to become a headache, and there was a bounce
in the contribution from non-life insurance. Coupled with a robust dividend
increase, this was enough to counter the drop in new business and profits in
the core UK life business, but not to eliminate doubts about the group's
position in the medium term.
Despite a battery of diversification initiatives, there is no avoiding the
Prudential's dependence on the domestic market, which is facing a plethora
of problems. Bad publicity is inevitable as the deadline for the new
commission disclosure regime approaches and the Securities and Investment
Board puts the finishing touches to compensation plans for poor pension
transfer advice. The new disclosure rules will only exacerbate the lack of
underlying growth in the life insurance market. Margins in traditional life
products are being squeezed, leaving companies such as the Pru to chase
lower margin investment business such as Peps.
The shares, driven down by these uncertainties during the course of the
year, now yield a third more than the market average. This provides support,
but only so long as investors do not start to question the Pru's capacity to
generate above average dividend increases in the medium term.
