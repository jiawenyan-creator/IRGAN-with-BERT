  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Posts and 
Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki said Friday [25 
February] his ministry will decide on what system to use for 
high-definition television (HDTV) within a year, instead of by 
summer as earlier planned. 
  Kanzaki said he has asked Akimasa Egawa, director general of 
the Broadcasting Administration Bureau, to launch a private 
advisory group to discuss how to proceed with the HDTV project 
from now on. 
  The minister's advisory group will include representatives 
from the electronics industry, the private broadcasting industry 
and Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), the public broadcasting 
network. 
  NHK already uses analog technology for high-definition 
television broadcasts. HDTV offers crisper images than 
conventional TVs. 
  Egawa caused a stir earlier this week when he said the 
ministry is considering abandoning the analog system in favor of 
digital technology, which would make possible more advanced 
functions, but later reversed his position in response to 
protests from NHK and consumer electronics companies.
