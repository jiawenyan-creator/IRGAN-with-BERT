ON THE SIDELINES; 
STABLE FIRES KILL 23 RACEHORSES 
Twenty-three racehorses, worth more than $760,000 were killed overnight in two 
separate stable fires in Australia, police said today. 
About 30 horses were rescued as fires spread through the stables of trainers 
Peter Miers in Sydney and Graham Turner in Melbourne late Monday night. 
A spokesman said police were investigating the cause of the fires but it was 
too early to say whether they were started deliberately. Racing officials said 
all the dead horses, mainly pacers and trotters, were of prime racing stock.
