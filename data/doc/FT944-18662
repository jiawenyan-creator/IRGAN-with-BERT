FT  03 OCT 94 / Coalfield boosted by 10-year power deal
National Power, Britain's largest electricity generator, has signed a
10-year contract to buy Welsh coal. It is thought to be the UK's
longest-lasting coal contract.
The move is a fillip for the coal industry as it enters the final stages of
privatisation. The government is expected to decide this month which
companies are to take over British Coal's assets later this year.
The deal increases the hopes of a long-term future for the south Wales
coalfield and the Aberthaw power station that it supplies.
National Power has conditionally agreed to buy 1.5m tonnes of coal a year
from next year from Ryan Group. This compares with the 1m tonnes a year
National Power buys from British Coal from south Wales.
The deal is conditional on Ryan winning its bid for the south Wales coal
region. Although Ryan is one of at least seven companies to have tendered
for south Wales, the deal suggests that National Power would be willing to
sign long-term deals with whichever company is successful, providing the
Ryan price can be matched.
Both National Power and PowerGen have previously indicated that they will
seek relatively short-term contracts when five-year deals negotiated by
British Coal last year expire in 1998.
The circumstances of the Welsh deal are unusual. Aberthaw power station has
been designed to burn - and therefore needs secure supplies of - the
low-volatile coal produced by the Welsh coalfield.
Neither National Power nor Ryan would discuss or confirm the deal yesterday.
