FT  21 JUL 93 / People: Property - Citibank
CITIBANK has appointed Nigel Kempner and Stephen Musgrave to run London
Capital Holdings, a newly formed property subsidiary.
London Capital Holdings was formed when Citibank took over the assets of
Rands-worth Trust, after the receivership of Randsworth's parent company.
The deal, which was an unusual example of a bank taking control of a UK
property company, had its origins in the 1989 Pounds 258m acquisition of
Randsworth by JMB Realty, a US investment group, which was financed by
Citibank. The collapse in the UK property market resulted in a large book
loss for Citibank.
Kempner and Musgrave, who were directors of Rands-worth between 1987 and
1993, have been appointed joint managing directors. Tony Brooks, finance
director of Citibank International, has been appointed to the board, as have
Stephen Karper and James Maguire, both directors of Citibank's UK Real
Estate Department.
