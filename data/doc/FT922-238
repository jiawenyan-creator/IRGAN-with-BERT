FT  29 JUN 92 / Observer: Cutback
Trimming expenses is one thing, but Royal Bank of Canada has ruffled more
than a few hairs by doing away with its corporate barbers.
For a modest CDollars 26 (about Pounds 12) a quarter, employees have for
years been entitled to as many haircuts as they need from a brace of barbers
installed in the bank's head offices in Montreal and Toronto.
But with the man in Montreal about to retire, and his counterpart in Toronto
topping only 35 polls or so weekly, the bank has elected to cease
subsidising the said fringe benefit.
The bankers should have seen the scissors coming a couple of years ago, when
Royal gave the boot to the man who polished senior executives' shoes each
morning.
