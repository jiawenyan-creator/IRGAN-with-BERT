FT  26 AUG 94 / People: Porvair
With an eye to the day when there is no longer any British Coal Corporation,
British Coal chairman Neil Clarke, 60, is adding to his portfolio of
non-executive directorships. He has joined the board of PORVAIR, a small
firm which manufactures materials with microporous structures and has a
market capitalisation of just under Pounds 50m.
Clarke, who has been British Coal chairman since 1991, was formerly chief
executive of Charter Consolidated. He is currently a director of Travis
Perkins and chairman of Genchem Holdings.
As part of the privatisation of British Coal, the government has set up the
Coal Authority which will take over British Coal's ownership of the nation's
coal reserves and be responsible for licensing coal-mining operations.
Sir David White, 64, chairman of Mansfield Brewery and a former part-time
member of British Coal's board, has been appointed chairman-designate of the
new authority which will eventually take over most of British Coal's
responsibilities.
