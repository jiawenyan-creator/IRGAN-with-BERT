SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pfizer, Inc., 235 East 42d St., New York, NY 10017, filed NADA 140940, which provides for making a 5.13 percent
Aviax

TM

 (semduramicin sodium) Type 

A medicated article (equivalent to 50 gram (g) of semduramicin per kilogram or 22.7 g per pound (g/lb)) used to make
a 25 parts per million semduramicin Type C medicated broiler chicken feed. The feed is used for the prevention of coccidiosis
caused by 

Eimeria tenella, E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. brunetti, E. necatrix, and E. mivati/E. mitis

 in broiler chickens.


The NADA is approved as of March 10, 1994, and the regulations are amended in part 558 (21 CFR part 558) by revising 558.4(d)
and adding new 558.555 to reflect the approval. The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom of information
summary.
Semduramicin is a Category I drug which, as provided in 558.4 as amended, does not require a medicated feed application
(form FDA 1900) for making a Type C medicated feed. The maximum concentration of semduramicin permitted in a Type B
medicated feed is 2.25 g/lb (0.05 percent).
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of 21 CFR part 20 and 21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii), a summary of
safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of this application may be seen in the
Dockets Management Branch (HFA305), rm. 123, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, from 9 a.m. to
4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, this approval qualifies for 5 years marketing
exclusivity beginning March 10, 1994, because no active ingredient (including any ester or salt thereof) has been
approved in any other application under section 512(b)(1) of the act.
FDA has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action and has concluded that the action
will not have a significant impact on the human environment and that an environmental impact statement is not required.
FDA's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment,
may be seen in the Docket's Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

the first set is for a Type B medicated feed and the second set is for a Type C medicated feed. These values (ranges) have
been assigned in order to provide for the possibity of dilution of a Type B medicated feed with lower assay limits to
make Type C medicated feed.
