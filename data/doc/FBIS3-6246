  [Text] The U.S. Justice Department has decided to demand 
that some 70 Japanese construction companies, including 
Ohbayashi Corporation and Nishimatsu Construction Company [NCC], 
pay a total of 1.1 billion yen in damages inflicted due to their 
bid-rigging on construction projects at Atsugi Naval Station. 
These construction firms, however, are perplexed over the U.S. 
accusation. NCC executive director Mikio Kunisawa said: 
"According to the Fair Trade Commission, there was no 
bid-rigging in tenders for the projects at Atsugi Naval Station. 
It seems that the United States is harassing us by putting 
forward the demand, behind which lies the trade friction between 
Japan and the United States." 
  In 1988, it was disclosed that Japanese construction firms 
rigged bids in tenders for constructing facilities at the U.S. 
base at Yokosuka. Many people in the construction industry 
assert that "bid-rigging practices in connection with projects 
at U.S. military bases were all unearthed at that time" 
(according to an official at a major construction firm). 
  Some people even claim that "to pressure Japan, the United 
States may intend to resume its Japan-bashing methods by making 
use of bribery cases involving major construction firms, in 
which lower house members were arrested for their involvement." 
  Meanwhile, the Japanese Construction Ministry is shocked by 
the "bid-rigging charge" by the United States as it comes at a 
time when the ministry is boasting of its achievement in 
averting possible U.S. sanctions in the Japan-U.S. construction 
talks in January. Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi has said: 
"Japan's attempts to review its bidding system (starting from 
fiscal year 1994) have been evaluated highly by the United 
States." A senior official at the ministry said: "We will 
decide what to do after confirming the intentions of the United 
States."
