FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: KIO's main Spanish unit 'in
danger of default'
THE KUWAIT Investment Office's main Spanish holding company, Torras, is in
danger of defaulting on a Pounds 100m (Dollars 192m) convertible bond,
should Torras' large chemicals affiliate, Ercros, press ahead with its
decision last week to file for protection from its creditors.
The Pounds 100m Eurobond, issued in 1988 by Phoenix International, is
guaranteed by Torras, which owns 40 per cent of Ercros.
According to the offer document that accompanied the bond issue in 1988,
Ercros is a 'principal associate' and the offer stipulates that any such
company which is unable to pay its debts or suffers the appointment of a
liquidator or receiver, could trigger a default on the bond.
'If Ercros files for protection, it could well trigger an event of default,'
said Mr David Norris, a director of the Law Debenture Trust Corporation, the
trustee of the bonds.
The trustee, however, would then have to evaluate whether the event of
default was prejudicial to bondholders, according to Mr Norris, before
asking for the bonds to be repaid. It could be decided that, if Ercros files
for protection, Torras itself will be in a stronger financial position as a
result, which would in turn benefit the holders whose bonds are guaranteed
by Torras.
The trustee is in communication with Torras, in an effort to clarify the
situation.
An investment banker who was close to the Phoenix bond issue said a default
on the security could have a 'significant effect' on Kuwait's status as a
borrower. Last year, KIO launched a Dollars 5.5bn jumbo bank loan to help
rebuild Kuwait after the Gulf war.
