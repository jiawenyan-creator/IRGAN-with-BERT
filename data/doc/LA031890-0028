ANTI-GAY VIEWS 
I am distressed by an item in the March 11 "Pop Eye" column, particularly the 
noting of Cinderella's Tom Keifer's hateful statements about gays. It is 
irresponsible of The Times to provide a forum for such views. If Keifer held 
similar views about blacks, I don't think his vile thoughts would be treated so 
lightly.
