    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 26 April. 
  Jacques Rogozinski, director of Banco de Obras Publicas and 
formerly in charge of privatization, has reported the 
privatization of the parastate and banking sectors has netted 
$24 billion in revenues for the country's treasury. He 
explained the resources allowed the Mexican Government to reduce 
internal and external debts and devote more budget funds to the 
country's social sectors. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1550

  Federal Electricity Commission officials have reported the 
federal government has decided to maintain subsidies for energy 
rates "for several years." This decision applies to energy for 
domestic use and irrigation purposes at farms. (Mexico City EL 
FINANCIERO in Spanish 19 Apr 94 p 15) 
  According to reports by the Mexican Stock Exchange and 
analyses by stock brokerage firms, the capital withdrawn from 
the stock market rose to $11.39 billion between 24 February and 
15 April. Stock market reports view "the exit of foreign 
resources" together with political uncertainty and the increase 
in interest rates in the United States as factors that determine 
investors' decisions. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 19 Apr 
94 p39) 
  In just seven weeks, the Bank of Mexico increased its 
holdings of government bonds by 168.8 percent, which went from 
33.2 billion new pesos on 15 February to 89.26 billion pesos on 
15 April, due to a drop in foreign and domestic investments. 
Domestic investors dropped their holdings by 15.1 billion 
pesos, while foreign investors dropped theirs by 3.23 billion 
pesos. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 19 Apr 94 p 7) 
  Credit Suisse and Bancomer have signed an agreement worth 20 
million francs to help Mexican firms that need to import 
machinery and industrial equipment from Switzerland. Meanwhile, 
private bankers, speaking at the monthly meeting of the Mexican 
Banking Association, AMB, said "there is no danger of a 
devaluation," and financial market nervousness is due to a 
"speculative bubble that is basically political." President 
Salinas and the economic cabinet met with AMB President Roberto 
Hernandez, and Salinas said "there will be no changes in the 
country's political, economic, and social course." (Mexico City 
EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 21 Apr 94 pp 7, 4) 
  There has been an "explosive" growth in Mexican air 
transport. In 1993 alone, there were 76,000 contracts to move 
merchandise, which earned $45.5 million for nine domestic 
airlines and approximately $34 million for international 
carriers. According to the National Institute of Geography, 
Statistics, and Data Processing, INEGI, the January trade 
deficit reached $1.4 billion, despite the fact all nonoil sales 
increased compared to the 1993 figures. Mexican exports during 
January totaled $4.91 billion, a 17.2-percent increase. Imports 
totaled $5.5 billion. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 22

  The Cemex Group will invest $400 million during 1994 to 
"increase its productive capacity in Mexico." Cemex believes 
this rate of investment will continue over the next three years 
at least. Cement production is estimated at 600,000 tons by 
1996. (Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in Spanish 22 Apr 
94 p 23a) 
  Eugenio Carrion, under secretary of the Commerce and 
Industrial Development Secretariat, Secofi, says deregulation 
for 30 staples has not driven prices up but, rather, down. 
Carrion repeated "there have been no price increases," and 
"there is no need to fear the end to price controls." (Mexico 
City LA JORNADA in Spanish 21 Apr 94 p 47) 
  Mexico earmarked $10.5 billion in 1993 exclusively to pay 
interest on its foreign debt. A Bank of Mexico report says this 
is the highest amount in six years. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in 
Spanish 25 Apr 94 pp 1, 42, 250) 
  The Bank of Mexico has reported that for the first time in 
two decades there was single digit inflation with an 8-percent 
annual inflation rate for 1993. Social expenditures, in 
relation to the Gross National Product, went from 2.6 percent in 
1988 to 4 percent in 1993 "to help raise the people's standard 
of living and encourage a more fair distribution of income," 
according to the Bank of Mexico. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1635 GMT
