FT  02 OCT 93 / UK, China still at odds over colony
BRITAIN and China failed to narrow their differences over proposed
democratic reforms for Hong Kong, in talks at the United Nations yesterday,
but they managed to make some progress on the question of financing a new
airport.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, had a three-hour meeting
with Mr Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, taking advantage of their
presence in New York for the UN General Assembly.
Mr Hurd told reporters afterwards that 'a considerable gap' remained between
the two sides. 'I cannot say we have narrowed it today,' he said, adding
that he had voiced his disappointment to Mr Qian.
Confirming that a 13th round of talks at a lower level would take place this
month, he emphasised that there was not an 'infinite' amount of time to
resolve their dispute.
No deadline had been set but Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong governor, would have
to move unilaterally to propose the enactment of necessary laws if there
were no agreement.
Mr Hurd said it was not the pace of democracy that was in dispute; the
argument was over whether elections to be held in 1995 - two years before
the colony is due to revert to China - would be 'fair, open and acceptable'.
On the airport question, on which there had been 'some progress but not
enough', he said this was a practical matter that should not have a
political dimension. The government, concerned about Hong Kong's future
prosperity, was anxious to 'avoid a vacuum' affecting air service agreements
in 1997.
The government had put forward its ideas, which he did not spell out. He and
Mr Qian had discussed them at the meeting. 'I hope it will be possible to
reach agreement,' Mr Hurd said.
