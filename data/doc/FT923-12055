FT  21 JUL 92 / Arts: Today's Television
REPEATS, repeats, repeats: the television companies have seemingly packed it
in and gone away for the summer, leaving a batch of old comedy series to
fill the screens.
Still there are always takers for Dad's Army (BBC 1 at 8pm), and Colin's
Sandwich, featuring Mel Smith (BBC 2 at 8.30) deserves a second chance to
make an impact.
Pick of the night is Town Hall (BBC 2 at 9.45). The series was fortunate in
catching Lewisham Council when its councillors and senior managers had to
cope with a major cash crisis, but even so this is the finest insight yet
into how political decisions that actual effect our lives are cobbled
together.
It should not matter that this is a dud night for television - there is
always the radio. The Prom on Radio 3 at 7.30 features a new work by Simon
Holt for solo viola and orchestra as well as Holst's 'Planets Suite', plus
some Benjamin Britten.
Is there life after Fleet Street? (Radio 4 at 8.30), has Stephen Pile
investigating the 'Street of Shame' now the press has moved to more sober
premises elsewhere.
