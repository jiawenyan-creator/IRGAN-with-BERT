  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Japan's prefectural and 
municipal governments will issue a record 1,690.0 billion yen 
worth of bonds to maintain balanced budgets in the current 
fiscal year through March 31, the Home Affairs Ministry said 
Friday [11 March]. 
  The figure marks a sharp increase from 1,102.8 billion yen 
worth of issues made the previous year, the ministry said. It 
attributed the rise to a sharp decrease in prefectural tax 
income due to the recession. 
  Issues by the country's 47 prefectures account for 1,365.8 
billion yen of the total figure. It is the first time all of 
the prefectures will issue such bonds. 
  Twelve designated big cities, including Osaka and Nagoya, 
will float a combined 105.6 billion yen worth of bonds and 
650-700 other smaller autonomies 218.6 billion yen worth. 
  Prefectural and municipal governments are allowed to issue 
bonds when operational and residence taxes paid by corporations 
and others fail to reach estimated sums. The ministry estimates 
tax revenues for prefectural and municipal governments will fall 
1.4 trillion yen short of the originally projected 34.55 
trillion yen.
