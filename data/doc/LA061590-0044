ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH 
UNBELIEVABLE: When the Ripley's Believe It or Not museum opens Aug. 24 in Buena 
Park, its centerpiece will be the crushed Chevrolet Sprint (above with museum 
worker John Dailey) in which 57-year-old Buck Helm survived four days before 
his rescue from the Nimitz Freeway collapse in Oakland last October. . . . A 
Ripley's spokesman said that after Helm died in November of his injuries in the 
Bay Area earthquake, his family offered the car free to the museum on the 
condition that it remain in California. . . . The car was too big for Ripley's 
San Francisco museum, where the license plates now are displayed. Mark I.
