FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Bougainville Copper hurt by
political instability
DIRECTORS of Bougainville Copper, the Papua New Guinea copper and gold
group, have declared a large loss for 1991. The result reflects write-downs
of the group's mothballed mining operations on Bougainville Island.
The company, which was forced by civil unrest to abandon its mining
operations in March 1990, slumped to a K313.2m (Dollars 328.8m) loss for the
year, compared with a K14.6m loss previously.
The loss reflects a K350m provision for deterioration of the mine assets,
offset by a K40.8m tax write-back. Directors said it was impossible to
calculate accurately the required write-down without access to the mine
site.
'While directors have made this provision in good faith, based on the
limited information available to them, it must be recognised that the actual
extent of the necessary write-downs can only be established when access to
the mine site by appropriate company personnel is again possible,' they
said.
However, they had not given up hope of a return to the mine site. While
considerable uncertainty surrounded the future of the mine, there had been
some encouraging progress on restoration of government services on
Bougainville Island.
'Considerable funding will be required to recommence operations. These
funding requirements cannot be forecast accurately, but could be in the
range of K300m to K450m if access becomes available by early 1993.'
