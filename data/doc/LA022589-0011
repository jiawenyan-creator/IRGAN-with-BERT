AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI AND 'THE SATANIC VERSES' 
In response to your editorial "No Safety Behind the Wall" (Feb. 15): 
I, of course, agree with your disgust at the bigotry represented by the conduct 
of many regarding "The Satanic Verses." But I was startled by your statement, 
"The Ayatollah Khomeini is no more a religious leader than was the Borgia 
Pope." That statement is simply untrue. Both men, by definition, are or were 
religious leaders. You also noted that, "Such squalid goings-on have as little 
to do with religion as they have with literature." Surely you have heard of the 
squalid, religion-based goings-on in the Middle East, Northern Ireland, 
Northern India, Pakistan, and the list could go on for pages. 
History teaches very graphically that religion, no matter what its bent, has 
never been a wellspring of tolerance for the beliefs of others. By its very 
nature, religion is an absolute. Honest education and a free society, with all 
of its imperfections, remain our only hope.
