FT  30 APR 92 / BA told to cut some flights in regions
THE Civil Aviation Authority yesterday ruled against British Airways at a
preliminary hearing over charges of anti-competitive practices.
In an unprecedented decision, it instructed BA to halve the number of
flights it operates between Edinburgh and Manchester from four daily to two.
That would allow a rival, Loganair, owned by British Midland Airways, to
make a profit on the route.
BA said it was 'surprised and disappointed' at the decision, and would
appeal to Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary.
It will maintain four flights a day pending his decision, which is expected
before the CAA's public appeal scheduled for June 18 and 19.
If upheld, the ruling would open the way for similar complaints such as that
by Virgin Atlantic Airways against BA. The two are engaged in libel actions
over allegations that BA had engaged in anti-competitive behaviour against
Virgin.
Virgin said yesterday that it would wait until after the court cases were
settled before considering going to the CAA.
Loganair had complained that it would lose money on the route unless BA's
flights were restricted.
BA increased its daily frequency on the route from one flight a day to four
in October 1991. Until then, Loganair operated four flights daily on the
route to BA's one.
The CAA found that both would lose money but that Loganair would suffer
more.
