FT  21 MAR 92 / FIS vows to fight
Algeria's banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) yesterday vowed to go on
fighting the country's leaders until they hold a general election, writes
Francis Ghiles.
After a secret meeting FIS leaders who have escaped detention said the FIS
was engaged in a battle 'of an oppressed people, deprived of the right to
decide their future. It is a combat against a handful of despots.'
