FT  24 NOV 94 / Backbenchers urge spending cuts
Conservative MPs are demanding swingeing public spending reductions in
Tuesday's Budget to pave the way for tax cuts before the next general
election, writes Philip Stephens, political editor.
More than half the Tory MPs responding to a Financial Times poll want Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to cut Pounds 5bn or more from next year's
Pounds 263bn expenditure total. Amid widespread agreement on the backbenches
that the social security budget should be his main target, nearly a third
call for overall reductions of more than Pounds 6bn.
Mr Clarke's personal rating has risen sharply, with 82 per cent saying he is
doing an excellent or good job compared with 68 per cent a year ago. But
nearly two-thirds of those questioned believe that a public spending squeeze
now must be followed by 'sizeable' tax cuts before the election. Only a
handful regard pre-election tax cuts as unimportant.
The survey, based on written responses from 70 Conservative Tory MPs,
reveals serious disquiet about the planned imposition next April of valued
added tax on fuel at the full 17.5 per cent rate.
