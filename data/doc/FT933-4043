FT  10 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Government view on contract indemnity
clauses
Sir, The headline in your report, 'Government backs down on tendering'
(September 7), may have given a misleading interpretation of the
government's view on indemnity clauses in tendering contracts. The report
related to the action of South Lakelend District Council, which had required
tenderers for a compulsory competitive tendering contract to provide an
indemnity against the contingency of the contract, if entered into in the
belief that no transfer of undertaking was involved being at some later
dated ruled to be subject to the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) regulations.
In such an event, the government's view is there would not normally be any
question of financial liability on the transferor authority. It takes the
view that local authorities do not normally have any cause to require
tenderers to provide indemnities, and any such requirements are liable to be
anti-competitive and in breach of CCT legislation.
In the South Lakeland case, the department took the view that it was not
appropriate to take statutory action against the council; we believed that -
notwithstanding the council's unjustified action in asking for indemnities -
there had in this case been a reasonable competitive response.
But in notifying South Lakeland of its decision, the department emphasised
the principle that indemnities were not normally appropriate, and clearly
spelt out that 'where an authority seeks to incorporate an indemnity clause
in (CCT) contract documentation, the secretary of state may decide to take
statutory action'.
Compulsory competitive tendering has given local residents and taxpayers
better services and lower costs. The government will continue to deal firmly
with authorities which seek to restrict competition with unreasonable
contract conditions or any other kind of anti-competitive action.
