  [Text] The prime minister has strongly defended the signing 
of the GATT treaty by India and urged the people not to be 
misled by the opposition propaganda. Addressing a public 
meeting in Port Blair yesterday, he said the country has to be a 
partner in the global trade treaty for the sake of faster 
development. Mr. Rao said the small-scale sector will not in 
any way be affected by India joining the multilateral trade 
system.
