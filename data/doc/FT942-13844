FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Sears, Roebuck in red as insurer
suffers
Sears, Roebuck suffered a first-quarter loss of Dollars 97.7m, or 27 cents a
share, after claims related to California's earthquake shook the company's
Allstate Insurance unit. In the same period a year ago, the group's income
from continuing operations amounted to Dollars 317m, or 82 cents.
Sears' consolidated revenues in the first quarter rose 8.6 per cent to
Dollars 12.27bn, from Dollars 11.3bn last year.
Allstate, which is 80.1 per cent-owned by Sears and contributed Dollars
320.1m to Sears' income in the first quarter of 1993, delivered Dollars
220.5m in losses in this year's first quarter.
The catastrophe losses at Allstate, which totalled Dollars 1.1bn for the
quarter, masked a strong performance by Sears' other main business, its
retail stores. Sears Merchandise Group's income more than doubled in the
first quarter, to Dollars 129.5m from Dollars 63.6m a year ago.
Group sales advanced to Dollars 6.9bn, from Dollars 6.1bn last year.
Mr Rick Nelson, retailing analyst for Duff and Phelps in Chicago, said
Sears' 12.4 per cent increase in comparable store sales during the quarter
reflected the success of its new merchandising strategies.
Homart, Sears' real estate division, saw income rise to Dollars 5.2m in the
first quarter from a loss of Dollars 8.2m a year ago.
Mr Edward Brennan, chairman, said: 'Operating performance at Sears
Merchandise Group and Allstate Insurance was solid, and the underlying
fundamentals of these groups are strong, as evidenced by revenue growth of
more than 8 per cent.'
