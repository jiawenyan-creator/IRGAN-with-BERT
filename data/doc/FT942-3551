FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: New chief at Shanks &amp; McEwan
Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management company, yesterday closed the book on
four months of searching to announce the appointment of Mr Mike Averill,
group operating officer, as chief executive.
He replaces Mr Gordon Waddell, who had been acting as temporary chief
executive since the abrupt departure of Mr Roger Hewitt in January following
a profits warning. Mr Hewitt is understood to have left the group following
pressure from institutional investors over Shanks' performance and a lack of
confidence in its management.
Mr Averill, 43, had been tipped as the most likely candidate to replace Mr
Hewitt. He came to Shanks through the acquisition of Rechem in 1993, where
he had been managing director.
