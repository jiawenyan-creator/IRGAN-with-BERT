  [Text] Moscow, 14 Jan -- U.S. President Bill Clinton, while 
addressing President Yeltsin and his wife Naina Yeltsin at an 
official dinner in the Faceted Hall of the Moscow Kremlin, 
pointed out that Russia's revival is due, to a great extent, to 
the Russian president. The U.S. leader said that "under your 
leadership Russia is building a market economy," and that "this 
great multi-ethnic democratic state is being cemented with the 
ideals of freedom and trust." 
  Bill Clinton went on to say that "yesterday I visited the 
Kazan Cathedral. The ancient church was recently rebuilt from 
new materials but nevertheless, its stands on its ancient 
foundations. It is exactly the same with Russia, Mr. President, 
which is creating a new society, yet it has its roots in the 
greatness of your history and your people." 
  Raising a glass to the Russian president, Bill Clinton 
proposed a toast "with deep respect and admiration to the great 
peoples of Russia and the United States and to the bright and 
firm prospects of freedom which enlightens our common future."
