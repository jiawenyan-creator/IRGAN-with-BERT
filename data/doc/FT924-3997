FT  04 DEC 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Film makers put in the picture
With the eye-piece of a video recorder pressed against one eye it is often
difficult for would-be movie makers to envisage what their video will look
like when completed. That is why Japanese camcorder manufacturer Sharp has
designed a machine which incorporates a four-inch colour TV screen which
shows the user exactly what is being recorded without the need for an
eyepiece.
Although the liquid crystal display screen is on the rear of the camera it
can be swivelled round so that, using a remote control unit, film-makers can
record themselves.
The VL-HL1, as it is called, has just been launched in Japan, and will be
available in the US and Europe next year. Sharp: Japan, 06 621 1221.
