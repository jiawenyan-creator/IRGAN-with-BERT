FT  14 OCT 94 / Steel areas win Pounds 36m EU recovery funding
The European Union is to give Pounds 36m to a number of UK regions whose
economies have been badly hit by steel industry job cuts in the past few
years. The money comes as part of the EU's Resider II programme, which aims
to help areas recover from industrial decline.
The funding is a victory for SteelAction, a coalition of 31 local
authorities with steel plants in their areas, which has been involved in
talks with the European Commission and the Department of Trade and Industry
for some months.
Mr Roger Stone, who chairs SteelAction, said yesterday: 'We welcome this
vital funding from Europe, which will give hope to communities that have
lost so many steel jobs with the run-down of the industry.'
Wales will receive Pounds 10.3m. Scotland (Lanarkshire) Pounds 8.1m, the
north-east (Teesside) Pounds 5.2m and Yorkshire and Humberside (South
Yorkshire and Scunthorpe) Pounds 12.5m.
Mr Stone said the money was a great deal more than the 'paltry' Pounds 4m
received by the UK from the first Resider programme in the late 1980s. 'We
worked hard, as a coalition of local authorities, to achieve this result,'
he said.
At a meeting in Sheffield yesterday SteelAction launched a plan to establish
a forum of local authorities in steel areas throughout the EU. Mr Chris
Mallender, SteelAction co-ordinator, said: 'We believe it's about time all
the steel communities came together to become the voice of steel in Europe.'
SteelAction comprises 16 councils in England, 13 in Wales and two in
Scotland, and has been a vociferous campaigner on European steel industry
issues.
In March it lobbied parliament and called on the government to 'meet fire
with fire' in the fight to save the British steel industry. The group has
strongly criticised what it sees as illegal subsidies for steel companies in
Italy, Spain and Germany, and the unfair competition this represents for
British producers.
