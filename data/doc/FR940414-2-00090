 

The Request


The PBGC has received a request from the San Francisco Baseball Associates, L.P. (the ``Buyer'') for an exemption
from the bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) with respect to its purchase of the San Francisco Giants
(the ``Seller'') on November 20, 1992. In the request, the Buyer represents among other things that:
1. The Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan (the ``Plan'') was established and is maintained pursuant to a collective
bargaining agreement between professional major league baseball teams and the Major League Baseball Players Association.
2. The Seller was a participating employer in the Plan.
3. The major league clubs have established the Major Leagues Central Fund (the ``Central Fund'') pursuant to the ``Major
League Agreement in re Major Leagues Central Fund.'' Under this agreement, contributions to the Plan for all participating
employers are paid by the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball from the Central Fund on behalf of each participating
employer in satisfaction of the employer's pension liability under the Plan's funding agreement. The monies in the
Central Fund are derived directly from (i) gate receipts from All-Star games, (ii) radio and television revenues
from World Series, League Championships, intradivision play-offs and All-Star games, and (iii) certain other radio
and television revenues, including revenues from foreign broadcasts, of regular and exhibition games.
4. During the 1992 Plan year, approximately $34.1 million was paid into the Plan on behalf of all major league clubs.
In that year revenues to the Central Fund exceeded expenses, including contributions to the Plan, by approximately
$354 million.
5. The amount of the bond/escrow required under section 4204 (a)(1)(B) of ERISA is $1,412,077, and the estimated amount
of the withdrawal liability that the Seller would incur if not for section 4204 is $4,796,483.
6. The contract of sale between the Buyer and the Seller was effective November 20, 1992, and the final closing occurred
on January 14, 1993.
7. The contract of sale provides that the Buyer agrees ``to contribute to the Plan substantially the same number of
contribution base units which the Seller had an obligation to contribute to the Plan.''
8. The contract of sale further provides that ``[i]f the Buyer thereafter, but prior to the end of the fifth plan year
commencing after the closing, partially or completely withdraws from the Plan, the Seller will be secondarily liable
for any withdrawal liability it would have had to the Plan ***.''
9. In support of the waiver request, the requestor asserts that:
``[B]ecause the Plan is funded directly from the Revenues which are paid from the Central Fund directly to the [Plan's]
Trust without first passing through the hands of any of the Employers, the Plan enjoys adequate security ***.
A change in ownership of an Employer does not in any way affect the obligation to fund the Plan *** nor
create the possibility that there will be difficulty in collecting Plan contributions due from any new owner ***.''

10. A complete copy of the non-confidential portions of the request has been sent to the Plan and the Union by certified
mail, return receipt requested.
