<USDEPT>ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HISTORIC PRESERVATION</USDEPT>


<USDEPT>36 CFR Part 800</USDEPT>



Protection of Historic Properties


Agency: 

Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.



Action: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking; revision of current regulations.





Summary: 

The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (Council) is proposing changes to its regulations in order to implement
the 1992 amendments to the National Historic Preservation Act and to improve the Section 106 process, by which Federal
agencies consider the effects of their undertakings on historic properties. The proposed changes seek to balance
the interests and concerns of various users of the Section 106 process, including Federal agencies, State Historic
Preservation Officers (SHPOs), Native Americans and Native Hawaiians, and the public. The revised regulations
also respond to the new Section 110 provisions in the 1992 amendments which require Federal agencies to establish
historic preservation programs.



Dates: 

Comments must be received on or before December 2, 1994. In recognition of the unique trust and treaty relationships
between the United States Government and Indian tribes, their enhanced role in the Section 106 process as directed
by the National Historic Preservation Act amendments of 1992, and the possibility that some tribes will need more
than 60 days to provide comments, the Council will provide on request an additional 30 days for an Indian tribe to submit
comments. A representative of the tribal government must file such request with the Council no later than December
2, 1994.



Addresses: 

Comments should be addressed to the Executive Director, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, 1100 Pennsylvania
Avenue, Suite 809, Washington, DC 20004. Fax 2026068647.



For Further Information Contact: 

Stephanie Woronowicz, Information Assistant, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue,
Suite 809, Washington, DC 20004 (202) 6068503.


Supplementary Information:
I. Background


Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 470f, requires Federal
agencies to take into account the effect of their undertakings on properties included in or eligible for inclusion
in the National Register of Historic Places and to afford the Council a reasonable opportunity to comment on such undertakings.
Public Law 102575 was enacted in October, 1992, and contains amendments to the National Historic Preservation
Act which affect the way Section 106 review is carried out under the Council's regulations. Furthermore, as part of
the Administration's National Performance Review, the Council undertook a review of the current regulatory process
to identify potential changes that could improve the operation of the Section 106 process and conform it to the principles
of this Administration. The Council commenced an information-gathering effort to assess the current Section 106
process and to identify desirable changes.
As a part of this effort, the Council sent a questionnaire to 1,200 users of the Section 106 process, including Federal
agencies, SHPOs, State and local governments, applicants for Federal assistance, Native Americans, preservation
groups, contractors involved in the process, and members of the public. The questionnaires sought opinions on the
current regulatory process and ideas for enhancing the process. The Council received over 400 responses. After analyzing
the responses and holding several meetings with Federal Preservation Officers and SHPOs, the Council staff presented
its preliminary findings to a special Council member Task Force comprised of the Department of Transportation, the
National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, Native
American representative William Tallbull, expert member Jane Davidson, and Council chairman Cathryn Buford Slater.
