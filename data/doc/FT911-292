FT  13 MAY 91 / Krajina votes on rule by Croatia
THE Serbian minority living in Croatia's region of Krajina voted yesterday
in a referendum on whether they wanted to unite with Serbia and stay within
a federal Yugoslavia.
An early count indicated that most people voted in favour of joining Serbia.
It was the first of five plebiscites to be held this month across the
country and a 'yes' vote will add to tensions between the minority Serbs and
the Croatian authorities.
Croatia, along with the other western republic, Slovenia, has already taken
steps towards secession and insists that the present federation of six
republics be transformed into a loose organisation of independent states.
Serbian leaders in Krajina said they would fight attempts by Croatia to
impose 'outside rule' over their territory, which they have proclaimed
autonomous. This is despite an accord reached last Thursday by the
collective presidency to try to halt clashes between Serbs and Croats which
have brought the country to the brink of civil war. Croatian authorities
declared the referendum illegal.
