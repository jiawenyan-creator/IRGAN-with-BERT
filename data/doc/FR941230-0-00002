four new locality pay areas corresponding to these metropolitan areas, and move five pay localities that were established
as locality pay areas in 1994 into the ``Rest of U.S.'' locality pay area. In addition, the regulations remove San Francisco
as an interim geographic adjustment area.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On October 18, 1994, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) published proposed regulations (59 FR 52467) based
on a recommendation of the Federal Salary Council to remove six metropolitan areas from the ``Rest of U.S.'' locality
pay area and establish six new locality pay areas corresponding to these metropolitan areas. At the direction of the
President's Pay Agent (consisting of the Secretary of Labor, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),
and the Director of OPM), the Bureau of Labor Statistics conducted local salary surveys in 199394 in these six
areas, which were in addition to the 27 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA's) and Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical
Areas (CMSA's) within which the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) conducted salary surveys for the implementation
of locality pay in January 1994.




The Council recommended that any area in which the pay disparity is 2/10ths of a percentage point or more below the pay
disparity for ``Rest of U.S.'' should be dropped as a separate pay locality and combined with ``Rest of U.S.'' The data
needed to make the determination for the six proposed areas did not become available until after the proposed regulations
were published. Four of the proposed six metropolitan areas met the conditions recommended by the Council for removal
from the ``Rest of U.S.'' locality pay area and establishment as separate pay localities. These four new locality
pay areas are (1) Columbus, OH; (2) Miami-Fort Lauderdale, FL; (3) Portland-Salem, OR-WA; and (4) Richmond-Petersburg,
VA. Two of the six proposed areas, Albuquerque, NM, and New Orleans, LA, have pay disparities that are more than 2/10ths
of a percentage point below that for the ``Rest of U.S.'' area. Therefore, they will remain in the ``Rest of U.S.'' area.

There are also five areas that were established by the Pay Agent as locality pay areas for 1994 that are being dropped
as separate locality pay areas and combined with ``Rest of U.S.'' for 1995 because they have pay disparities that are
2/10ths of a percentage point or more below the ``Rest of U.S.'' These areas are (1) Memphis, TN-AR-MS; (2) Norfolk-Virginia
Beach-Newport News, VA-NC; (3) Oklahoma City, OK; (4) Salt Lake City-Ogden, UT; and (5) San Antonio, TX.

There are 27 locality pay areas for 1995. They consist of 26 areas corresponding to MSA's or CMSA's, including certain
``areas of application'' contiguous to 2 CMSA's, plus 1 area composed of the ``Rest of U.S.'' (i.e., those portions
of the 48 contiguous States not located within another locality pay area). MSA's and CMSA's are defined by OMB.

OPM received comments on locality pay areas from two members of Congress, one individual, one agency, and three organizations.
Section 5304(f)(1) of title 5, United States Code, authorizes the President's Pay Agent to provide for such pay localities
as the Pay Agent considers appropriate. Comments on the proposed regulations were reviewed by the President's Pay
Agent. The Pay Agent decided to adopt the changes in locality pay areas that were recommended by the Federal Salary
Council. The final regulations list each of the locality pay areas for 1995 and are issued by OPM under the authority
in 5 U.S.C. 5304(i).
