FT  06 OCT 94 / Nadir aide charged over Polly money
Mrs Elizabeth Forsyth, a close associate of Mr Asil Nadir, was yesterday
charged with two offences of handling money stolen from Polly Peck
Inter-national, the fruit-to-electronics empire formerly chaired by the
fugitive businessman.
Mrs Forsyth chaired South Audley Management, the company that dealt with Mr
Nadir's personal tax and property affairs.
She was charged at Holborn police station yesterday morning and later
appeared at Bow Street magistrates court to be remanded on bail until
November 16.
The two charges allege that between October 16 and 22 1989 Mrs Forsyth
handled Pounds 458,050 belonging to Polly Peck.
Mrs Forsyth was granted bail on sureties of Pounds 20,000. She was also
ordered to surrender her passport, undertake not to apply for a new one, and
to remain in Britain.
Mrs Forsyth returned voluntarily from northern Cyprus last month to be
questioned by Serious Fraud Office investigators.
Mr Nadir remains in northern Cyprus, where he fled in May last year before
he was due to stand trial on 13 charges of fraud and false accounting
charges involving Pounds 34m.
