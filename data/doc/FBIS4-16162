  [Text] Brussels April 13 (TASS) -- A NATO official said on 
Wednesday that the North Atlantic Alliance is not making any 
plans for Bosnia behind Moscow's back. 
  He told ITAR-TASS that NATO leaders held a meeting today and 
expressed satisfaction with the results of air raids on Sunday 
[10 April] and Monday which were carried out in accordance with 
U.N. Security Council Resolution 836. 
  He said NATO leaders did not discuss Moscow's reaction to 
air 
raids or prospects for Russia's accession to the Partnership for 
Peace programme. They reiterated NATO's readiness to provide 
aviation support if U.N. forces come under attack in Bosnia 
again. 
  The official did not rule out the possibility that the date 
of signing the Partnership for Peace agreement by Russia set for 
April 21 may be changed because there has been no official 
confirmation from Russia yet. He expressed that hope that it 
will happen as soon as possible. 
  The official noted that NATO acted as an executor of the 
U.N. 
will and all complaints and protests should be directed to the 
United Nations which bears all responsibility for the action. 
He confirmed NATO's intention to act in close contact with 
Russia in order to restore peace in the former Yugoslavia, 
adding that the Partnership for Peace programme could provide a 
good foundation for such cooperation.
