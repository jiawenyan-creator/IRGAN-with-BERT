  [Abstract] This article discusses the intermediate 
climatic effects of atomic power plants on the environment. The 
plant used as an example is the Leningrad atomic power plant, 
which has a boiling-water uranium-graphite reactor. The two main 
factors affecting the environment are the release of radioactive 
materials from the stack, and the release of hot water into a 
natural body of water (in this case a section of the Gulf of 
Finland). The classification of accidents in the Russian system 
and the IAEA is contrasted. The Russian system has two levels of 
accident: one which can be handled automatically by the plant 
(which the plant is designed for), and the other is a 
catastrophic accident. The accident of the Leningrad plant on 24 
March 1992 is used as an example. The table presents maximum 
permissible concentrations of emissions for a stack height of 
100 m. The figure gives dosage versus distance data for fallout 
of iodine from a radioactive cloud. A formula is presented to 
calculate possible ground level concentrations of contaminants.
