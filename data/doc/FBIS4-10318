  [Text] Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the 
National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], has ruled 
out the participation of third parties in the conference on the 
Nation and the Emigre Community scheduled for 22-24 April in 
Havana. He said that representatives from Cuba and its community 
abroad will participate exclusively in this conference. 
  In a meeting with the press in Camaguey, Alarcon de Quesada 
stressed the importance of the meeting as part of a process 
toward normalization of relations between Cuba and its community 
abroad. 
  The ANPP president also referred to the special situation of 
Cuban residents in the United States, some of whom have been 
manipulated by imperialism against the Revolution since the very 
beginning. 
  Alarcon de Quesada added that the conference, to be held in 
11 days, will favor the new trends and the old, pre-1959 
migrations to the United States, with the objective of working 
in order to survive.
