The main Iranian opposition group named 1,107 political prisoners it said have 
been executed by Iran since the August cease-fire in the Persian Gulf War with 
Iraq. In a telegram sent to U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, 
Massoud Rajavi, leader of the Iraq-based Moujahedeen organization, said the 
reported figure is only a portion of at least 12,000 political executions 
carried out throughout Iran in the last five months. Rajavi quoted eyewitness 
reports from Iran as saying that a great number of political prisoners have 
been executed in recent weeks with the use of poison gas.
