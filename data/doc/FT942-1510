FT  23 JUN 94 / Assembly to vote on Tapie
Mr Bernard Tapie, the French entrepreneur turned politician, will on Tuesday
face a National Assembly vote to decide whether to endorse yesterday's
recommendation by a committee to lift his parliamentary immunity. Mr Tapie,
whose left-wing Energie Radicale movement won 12 per cent of the votes in
this month's European elections, could then face two separate fraud charges
concerning the purchase of the Phocea, his luxury yacht. His immunity was
previously lifted late last year so he could be examined in a fraud case
concerning Testut, one of his old business interests. Mr Tapie's critics
have accused him of becoming a Euro-MP to stave off further legal threats. A
cartoon on the front page of today's Le Monde shows him monocycling across a
tightrope stretched between the French and European parliaments.
