FT  31 JUL 93 / ITC may face court challenge from ITV
SENIOR ITV executives want the powers and responsibilities of the
Independent Television Commission to be tested in court after the row over
the timing of News at Ten.
The ITC and the ITV companies have sharply different legal opinions on the
issue of the main news bulletin.
A judicial review in the High Court is seen as the only way of deciding
which opinion is correct and whether the ITC has the power to insist that
the programme should run at a particular time.
Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association and chief executive of London
Weekend Television, believes the issue is much wider than News at Ten. He
believes that the 1990 Broadcasting Act is ambiguous on the respective
powers and responsibilities of the ITC and the ITV companies. Apart from
timing, he would like a ruling on ITV's obligation to provide a diverse
schedule.
One possibility to be discussed would involve persuading the ITC to
acquiesce in an ITV application for a judicial review to clarify the issue.
Meanwhile opposition is growing to any relaxation of the rules preventing
the nine largest ITV companies taking over each other.
The Glasgow-based Daily Record newspaper has published a letter from Mr Ian
Lang, the Scottish secretary, to Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage
secretary, in which Mr Lang expresses concern about the implications of such
a relaxation for Scotland.
Regional programme-making obligations might still be enforced but there was
no protection for network programme production in the event of a takeover.
Mr Lang argues for stricter rules so that, at least in Scotland, ITV
companies cannot take over neighbours in order to protect their separate
identities.
Even supporters of the relaxation of takeover rules believe this is now less
likely.
