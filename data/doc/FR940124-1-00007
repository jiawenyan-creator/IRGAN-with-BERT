<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing receipt of additional revisions pertaining to a previously proposed amendment to the Utah permanent
regulatory program (hereinafter, the ``Utah program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of
1977 (SMCRA). The additional revisions for Utah's proposed rules pertain to the scope of rulemaking and promulgation
of rules, hearing requirements for designating areas unsuitable for coal mining, confidentiality of coal exploration
information, and mining in special areas, specifically prime farmland. The amendment is intended to incorporate
the additional flexibility afforded by the revised Federal regulations, clarify ambiguities, and improve operational
efficiency.




This document sets forth the times and locations that the Utah program and proposed amendment to that program are available
for public inspection and the dates and times of the reopened comment period during which interested persons may submit
written comments on the proposed amendment.
