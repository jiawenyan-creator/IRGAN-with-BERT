Two San Jose State basketball players who walked out with eight teammates Jan. 
18 when they demanded the firing of Coach Bill Berry, were refused 
reinstatement because they violated National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules, 
announced Randy Hoffman, San Jose State athletic director. 
David Hollaway, a former L.A. Crenshaw High School player, and Angelo Foccia 
were declared ineligible to compete the rest of the season because they 
received special treatment as athletes. 
The benefits included discussions with an attorney without paying a nominal 
fee, and the attorney provided the players entertainment on a yacht Super Bowl 
Sunday. 
Hoffman plans to pursue restoring the athletic eligibility of Hollaway, a 
freshman and Foccia, a sophomore, who expressed a desire to return to the team.
