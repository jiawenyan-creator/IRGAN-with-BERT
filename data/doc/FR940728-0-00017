 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Schweizer Aircraft Corporation and Hughes
Helicopters, Inc. Model 269A, 269A1, 269B, 269C, and TH55A series helicopters, that requires mandatory
replacement of all the clevis pins associated with the belt drive clutch control installation. This amendment is
prompted by an accident involving the separation of the belt drive clutch control spring assembly (spring assembly)
from the idler pulley assembly. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent separation of the spring assembly
from the idler pulley assembly, loss of power to the main rotor system, and a subsequent forced landing. 


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Effective September 1, 1994.


The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the
Federal Register as of September 1, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to Schweizer Aircraft Corporation and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 269A, 269A1,
269B, 269C, and TH55A series helicopters was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 4, 1993 (58 FR 41444). That action proposed to require replacement of all clevis pins associated with the
belt drive clutch control installation. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed with one change. The AD proposed compliance on
or before January 13, 1994, or within the next 400 hours' time-in-service (TIS), whichever comes first. Since January
13, 1994, has passed, the AD has been changed to now require compliance within 30 days after the effective date of the
AD or within 400 hours' TIS, whichever comes first. 
The FAA estimates that 1,100 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
1/2 work hour per helicopter to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts will cost approximately $10 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD
on U.S. operators is estimated to be $41,250. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption
