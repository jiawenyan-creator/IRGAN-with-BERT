Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Notice of Taxonomic Change of Erigeron Maguirei var. Maguirei (Maguire
Daisy) to Erigeron Maguirei (Maguire Daisy); Proposal To Reclassify From Endangered to Threatened Status


<AGENCY>

ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The plant 

Erigeron maguirei

 (Maguire daisy) previously included two recognized varieties: 

E. maguirei

 var. 

maguirei,

 listed as endangered in 1985, and 

E. maguirei

 var. 

harrisonii,

 a category 2 candidate species. A recent taxonomic revision has synonymized these two plant varieties into one species,


E. maguirei,

 because morphological differences that were previously used to distinguish between the two varieties have been
determined to be ecotypic and not genetically fixed. The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) accepts this taxonomic
revision, and proposes to change the endangered 

E. maguirei

 var. 

maguirei

 to 

E. maguirei

 and to reclassify it to threatened status under the authority of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended
(16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

). 

Erigeron maguirei 

is endemic to sandstone canyons and mesas in the San Rafael Swell in Emergy County, Utah, and the Capitol Reef in Wayne
County, Utah. This species is found in small populations and portions of its habitat are subjected to adverse effects
from mineral and recreational development and livestock grazing. A determination that 

E. maguirei

 is a threatened species would continue to provide this species protection under the authority of the Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background



The genus 

Erigeron

 (composite family, Asteraceae) includes the Maguire daisy (

E. maguirei

) and about 200 other species (Cronquist 1947). Most of these species are found in the Western Hemisphere, and the Western
United States is their present center of distribution. The Maguire daisy is a perennial, herbaceous plant. Its stems
are decumbent to sprawling or erect and 7 to 18 cm (2.76 to 7.09 in) in height. The basal leaves are spatulate or broadly
oblanceolate in outline, 2 to 5 cm (0.79 to 1.97 in) long and 0.6 to 0.9 cm (0.24 to 0.35 in) wide. Its cauline leaves are
sessile or short-petiolate, alternately arranged on the stem, and they are well developed. The leaves are slightly
reduced towards the tip, i.e., oblanceolate becoming lanceolate or narrowly ellipsoid apically. Both the leaves
and stems are copiously covered with a spreading hirsute pubescence. One to three flower heads are borne at the end
of each stem. The floral disc is 8 to 10 mm (0.32 to 0.39 in) wide; the involucre is 5 to 6.5 mm (0.20 to 0.26 in) high. Each
floral head has 15 to 20 white or pinkish white colored ligules (ray flowers) about 6 to 8 mm (0.24 to 0.32 in) long and
1.5 to 2 mm (0.06 to 0.08 in) wide. The disk flowers are orange, about 3.5 to 3.8 mm (0.14 to 0.15 in) long. The seeds are
2-nerved achenes. (Cronquist 1947; Welsh 1983a, 1983b; Welsh et al. 1987).


Erigeron maguirei

 was described by Cronquist (1947) from a 1940 specimen collected by Dr. Bassett Maguire from Calf Canyon in the San
Rafael Swell, Emery County, Utah. 

Erigeron maguirei

 var. 

harrisonii

 was first discovered at Hickman Natural Bridge in the Capitol Reef of Wayne County, Utah, by Dr. Bertrand Harrison
in 1936, and it was finally described by Welsh (1983a) from a specimen that he collected in 1982. However, Welsh postulated
that the morphological variations between 

E. maguirei

 var. 

maguirei

 in the San Rafael Swell and 

E. maguirei

 var. 

harrisonii

 from the Capitol Reef may represent only ecotypic variation (Welsh 1983a, 1983b; Welsh et al. 1987). Heil (1989) reported
both varieties from Capitol Reef and postulated that 

E. maguirei

 var. 

harrisonii

 was an ecotypic shade variant of 

E. maguirei.

 Using DNA analysis, VanBuren (1993) demonstrated that 

E. maguirei 

var. 

maguirei

 and 

E. maguirei 

var. 

harrisonii

 were of the same taxonomic entity and that separation of the two at the varietal level was not warranted. This finding
was of great interest to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), since 

E. maguirei

 var. 

maguirei

 was listed as an endangered species at that time.
Recent status surveys of endangered, threatened, and other rare plant species in the San Rafael Swell (Kass 1990)
and Capitol Reef (Heil 1989) have shown a total population of about 3,000 

E. maguirei

 plants in five populations that occur on both Federal and State lands. Although combining the two varieties into one
type increased the total number of plants in the wild, 

E. maguirei

 still remains vulnerable to threats due to the loss of habitat.
