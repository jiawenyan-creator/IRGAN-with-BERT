  [Text] In Beijing on 11 May, Chinese Premier Li Peng said 
that as a developing nation, conditions for China's return to 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] have now 
ripened and there is no more reason to continue excluding it 
from the trade organization. Meeting with renowned foreign 
participants to an international high-level economic forum, Li 
Peng said: China needs to resume its contracting status in GATT 
and has made efforts in this respect. In the meantime, GATT and 
the future World Trade Organization also need China. If a 
worldwide trade organization is to exclude China -- a country 
with a 1.2 billion population and rapidly developing economy -- 
it will be hard to say that such an organization is a whole one. 
Welcoming foreign guests to the economic forum, Li Peng said: 
A meeting of this nature is necessary in strengthening 
understanding, exchange, and cooperation between China and 
foreign countries; it is hoped that such a forum will be held 
regularly in the future. 
  Attending the economic forum, which opened on the same day, 
were Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir, former German Chancellor 
Schmidt, and other renowned foreign political and economic 
figures.
