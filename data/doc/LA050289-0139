TRUCKLOAD OF EXPLOSIVES OVERTURNS 
A truck carrying military explosives overturned on Interstate 20 just outside 
this West Texas town, and police closed the highway and briefly ordered 
evacuations before learning the explosives were not armed. 
Local authorities said the truck carried 48 rocket pods containing 644 M-77 
anti-tank grenades and a quantity of rocket fuel, but there was no explosion 
and no fire. Explosives experts from Ft. Sill, Okla., and Ft. Hood, Tex., 
inspected the accident site and determined there was no danger, said officials 
at the scene from the state Department of Public Safety and Dyess Air Force 
Base. The authorities decided to have the explosives loaded onto trucks for 
transfer to Dyess, where they were to be examined further.
