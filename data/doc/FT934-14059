FT  19 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Charity tax relief should be
abolished
Sir, A debate on the future of charities is timely, but I comment here on
only one aspect. Tax.
Tax exemption should be withdrawn from all charities. It is not so much the
distortion that it causes in the fiscal balance (along with exemption for
pension funds and mortgage interest), but charity, properly speaking, is a
personal and voluntary matter. Why then are we, as taxpayers, compelled to
contribute to countless causes of which we know nothing and of some of which
we may disapprove?
It is no argument to say that we cannot control how our taxes are spent,
other than at the ballot box. There are expenses of the state which must be
paid for, whether some of us like it or not. This is not so with charities,
support of which by the state is not essential and which detracts from the
voluntary concept.
The charity scene is getting out of control. Countless small organisations
are becoming registered as charities with no object other than getting tax
relief, the amount of which will be trivial, and with the charities having
little understanding of the onerous legal and administrative obligations
which they incur. The vague definition of what is charitable enables some
very strange causes to qualify. If tax relief were abolished, there would be
no reason for the Charity Commissioners to be concerned.
I am a trustee of a substantial endowed charity which makes good use of its
refunds, but if they were withdrawn over a period we should learn to live
without them. We might then deregister, if that were possible.
Charitable status has caused us enormous expense in order to comply with
legal requirements for transactions the purpose of which was, by common
consent, entirely proper. I have yet to find any benefit other than tax
relief. These are not necessarily the views of my co-trustees.
