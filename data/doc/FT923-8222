FT  12 AUG 92 / Mortgage lenders appeal over fund
THE COUNCIL of Mortgage Lenders urged the Law Society yesterday not to
impose a limit on payments to victims of solicitors' dishonesty from its
compensation fund.
To stem the rise in mortgage fraud, the council wants the society to
introduce tougher controls on solicitors' accounts and new restrictions on
solicitors who practise on their own.
The profession is considering capping the compensation payments to banks and
building societies as part of proposals to meet a rise in fraud claims.
