FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Currency movements help lift Vivat to
Pounds 1.84m
VIVAT Holdings, the Lee Cooper jeans and casual wear manufacturer, has
lifted interim profits by 55 per cent with help from favourable currency
fluctuations.
The company yesterday reported a pre-tax surplus of Pounds 1.84m (Pounds
1.2m) for the six months to June 30 on turnover up 8 per cent at Pounds
38.33m. At constant exchange rates, however, turnover fell by 7 per cent,
while pre-tax profit rose by about 10 per cent.
Mr Christopher Burnett, chairman, said the increase was made against a
background of difficult trading, particularly in key western European
markets, and was after the inclusion of an above-the-line cost of Pounds
500,000, 'principally to cover the cost of reorganisation within our French
subsidiary.'
Earnings per share increased to 2.4p (1.6p). There is no interim dividend
but Mr Burnett said he was confident of a final at least equal to last
year's 1p per ordinary share.
