FT  24 OCT 92 / Labour demands 'new deal for 90s'
THE Labour party dismissed as political expediency yesterday the shift this
week in Mr John Major's economic strategy, demanding instead a detailed
national recovery programme to deliver a 'new deal for the 1990s'.
In a policy speech designed to set out a more distinctive Labour position in
the economic debate at Westminster, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor,
warned that lower interest rates alone would not bring a lasting upturn.
Mr Brown said that, without a clear strategy to strengthen manufacturing and
an employment policy designed to strengthen consumer confidence, the
government would lead Britain from a 'recession crisis into a
balance-of-payments crisis'.
Challenging Mr Major to reveal whether the government now had any policy on
the stability of the pound, Mr Brown said that, for the recovery to be
sustainable, management of the exchange rate must remain a central element
of anti-inflation policy.
He said that a national recovery programme, which could not wait until the
government made its Autumn Statement on November 12, should take as its
starting point evidence that consumer and business confidence would not
return until the fear of unemployment was reduced.
The government needed also to ensure that the recovery was balanced and
sustainable, threatening neither a sharp deterioration in the trade deficit
nor an upsurge in inflation.
Mr Brown called for immediate action by Mr Major to:
Establish an emergency employment programme to re-move fear of the dole
queue.
Reduce interest rates. Consult all sections of industry to agree an
industrial policy that would raise exports, reduce imports and build the
long-term strength of the manufacturing base.
Agree action with the building societies and local authorities to pull the
housing market out of recession.
Preserve government capital spending programmes and jointly finance, with
the private sector, large-scale infrastructure projects.
