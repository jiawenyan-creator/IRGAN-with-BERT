Afghan guerrillas blew up a bridge on the only paved road from Kabul to 
Jalalabad, the Afghan government said, disrupting supplies to the city chosen 
as the rebels' first major objective after the Soviet troop withdrawal was 
completed last month. But a spokesman said that three other roads, all unpaved 
and more circuitous, remain open. He said the bridge near Sarobi, about midway 
between the capital and Jalalabad, 75 miles to the east, was one of about 100 
on the highway. Muslim rebels launched their offensive against Jalalabad on 
March 6, but their drive has bogged down in the face of strong opposition.
