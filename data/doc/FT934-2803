FT  11 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hopes of cut in discount
rate help Nikkei
Hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate prompted short
covering in the futures market; share prices gained ground, led by a rise in
the electronics sector, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei index rose 195.52 to 17,257.43, down 1.2 per cent on the week.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 18.97 to 1,456.71 and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.69 to 1,190.06.
Following the fixing of the settlement price for December stock futures and
options contracts, the index fell to a low of 16,786.68 in the morning
session. However, index-linked buying by investment trust funds supported
prices and the index hit a high of 17,534.85 in the afternoon.
The afternoon release of the tankan, the Bank of Japan's quarterly report on
business sentiment held little in the way of surprises for investors, and
failed to affect trading in the afternoon.
But market participants were encouraged by a strengthening of the dollar
against the yen, prompted by expectations of lower Japanese interest rates.
The dollar closed up Y0.33 at Y108.98.
Volume surged to 600m shares from 230m on trading linked to the futures and
options settlements. Gainers led losers by 804 to 252, with 106 unchanged.
Foreign investors were seen buying high-tech exporters. Sony jumped Y170 to
a year's high of Y5,200 while Aiwa also rose Y20 to a new year's high of
Y1,820.
Heavy electricals were also strong on active trading. Toshiba rose Y5 to
Y673 while Hitachi gained Y24 to Y810. Automakers gained ground, with Suzuki
Motor up Y38 to Y1,020 and Honda Motor rising Y60 to Y1,430.
Some retailers were lower on fears of a further deterioration in consumer
confidence. Aoyama Trading fell Y890 to Y6,720.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 345.43 to 19,254.78 in volume of 27.2m
shares.
