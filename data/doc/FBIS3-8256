  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, March 8 (AFP) -- A ceasefire accord 
between Bosnia's Moslems and Croats was holding Tuesday as UN 
troops patrolled 350 kilometres (210 miles) of front lines and 
collected heavy weaponry, Radio Sarajevo reported. [passage 
omitted] 
  Sarajevo radio said that both Moslems and Croats were 
pulling 
back heavy weapons 10 kilometres (six miles) from the front 
lines in central and southern Bosnia and tanks and artillery 
weapons were pulled back 20 kilometres (12 miles.) UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) officials said however that it would take them 
several more days before all the weapons were withdrawn or 
placed under UN control. 
  The ceasefire agreement, patterned after a similar truce for 
Sarajevo, was signed last week in Washington and is part of an 
overall accord between Bosnia's Moslems and Croats to form a 
loose federation. 
  The two sides on Monday also agreed to a prison exchange in 
the central Bosnian tows of Busovaca, Travnik and Vitez, the 
radio said without providing a specific date for the exchange or 
the number of prisoners involved. [passage omitted] 
  The Moslem-Croat negotiations meanwhile that started at the 
US Embassy in Vienna last Friday resumed there Tuesday. The head 
of the Moslem delegation, Bosnian Justice Minister Kasem Trnka, 
said talks were being held in a "good atmosphere" and "the 
question of the constitution (for the new federation) should be 
concluded tonight."
