FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hopewell earnings boosted by
CEPA sale
Hopewell Holdings, the Hong Kong property and construction group controlled
by Mr Gordon Wu, yesterday announced a 20 per cent rise in net profits to
HKDollars 2.4bn (USDollars 310m) for the year to June 30, up from HKDollars
2bn in the previous year.
The company booked exceptional items of HKDollars 1.8bn, including HKDollars
1.2bn from the spin-off last November of Consolidated Electric Power Asia
(CEPA), a vehicle incorporating Hopewell's power stations.
The net result was HKDollars 1.6bn less than Mr Wu's forecast of a doubling
of profits, made at the time of the spin-off, but was in line with market
expectations.
Analysts say they do not expect to see quality recurrent earnings come on
stream until 1996, when CEPA and the Guangzhou-Shenzhen superhighway will
start making more significant contributions.
Earnings per share climbed 10 cents to 57 cents, and the directors are
proposing a dividend of 19 cents, an improvement of 1 cent on last year.
Profit at the operating level rose to HKDollars 795.5m from HKDollars
733.2m, reflecting the bigger role played by exceptional items in the
previous year. Then, property sales and other exceptionals totalled
HKDollars 2.1bn.
Hopewell benefited from a sharply lower tax bill this year, at HKDollars
105.6m compared with HKDollars 287.2m. This reflects the increase in its
share of earnings from overseas, which are not liable to Hong Kong tax.
CEPA's projects are mainly in China (where foreigners can enjoy tax-free
periods of around six years), the Philippines, and south-east Asia.
Deductions for minority interests also fell, to HKDollars 172m from an
abnormally large HKDollars 683m.
The previous year's figure was swollen by the sale of a property owned by a
company in which Hopewell had a 60 per cent interest.
