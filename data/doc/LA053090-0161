HELMS EXPLAINS STANCE ON GAYS 
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has clarified his stance on homosexuals, saying he 
doesn't hate them. "I was taught from the time I was a little boy to hate the 
sin and love the sinner," Helms told The Charlotte Observer. 
"But the way these people conduct themselves makes the second half of that 
mighty difficult sometimes." Helms, who unsuccessfully tried to stop the Senate 
from passing a $600-million AIDS relief bill, said he fought the legislation 
because most AIDS victims are drug addicts or homosexuals and he doesn't want 
Congress to subsidize either group. "You're talking about what is decent and 
moral behavior," he said. 
"And it (homosexuality) is not decent and moral and we are taught biblically 
what it is -- it's an abomination." Helms even objects to the use of the word 
"gay" to describe homosexuals. "I resent the corruption of a very fine word," 
he said.
