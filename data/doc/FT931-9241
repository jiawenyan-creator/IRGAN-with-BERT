FT  15 FEB 93 / Venezuela hosts talks on free trade
THE presidents of Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela, meeting in Caracas, the
Venezuelan capital, as the Group of Three, have pledged to establish a free
trade zone for their 145m consumers from January 1, 1994, writes Joseph Mann
from Caracas.
There was some speculation in Caracas that the pact may be an effort to
provide Colombia and Venezuela with a 'side door' to benefits from the North
American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
The G3 presidents and the chief executives of six central American states
also called for a free trade area, by July 1 1993, between G3 members and
Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama.
Mr Carlos Andrea Perez, president of Venezuela, said that Caribbean nations
would also be invited to take part in regional trade negotiations with the
G3 and central American governments. The G3, founded in 1989, plans to hold
its next presidential summit in Guatemala in January 1994.
