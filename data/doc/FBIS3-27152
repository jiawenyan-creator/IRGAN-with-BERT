  [Text] Belgrade, February 20 (XINHUA) -- The president of 
the self-proclaimed "the Serb's Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina," 
Radovan Karadzic, said today that the withdrawal of heavy 
weapons from around Sarajevo is progressing smoothly and 
everything is going on as anticipated. 
  So far, the Serb side has removed 80 percent of its heavy 
weapons off Sarajevo and the rest probably won't go as is 
scheduled because of the road blockade after heavy snowfalls, 
reports said. 
  The UN peacekeeping forces offered gas and trucks to help 
Serbs carry on their weapons withdrawal, Karadzic said, adding 
that "so we hope everything will be accomplished as we have 
expected." 
  In a statement reported by the Belgrade radio today, speaker 
of "the Serb's republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina" Momcilo Krajisnik 
said both civilian and military leaders of the country had 
exerted the greatest efforts to prevent the worst from happening 
and foster peace in Sarajevo and throughout Bosnia. 
  "We took an audacious step by agreeing to withdraw our heavy 
weapons from around Sarajevo," he said. 
  "But we are not to demilitarize our troops, or hamper the 
interests of the Serbian people," he added. 
  The international community could see from the Serbs' choice 
who backs peace and who wants war, he said.
