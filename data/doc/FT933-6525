FT  27 AUG 93 / Brazilians challenge new tax on cheques
A NEW tax on cheques came into force in Brazil yesterday, amid legal actions
to challenge its constitutionality, Christina Lamb writes from Rio de
Janeiro.
The 0.25 per cent tax on financial operations is a crucial part of the
government's attempts to plug a federal budget deficit expected to reach the
equivalent of Dollars 31.5bn next year.
The government hopes to raise Dollars 600m per month through the tax, to
remain in force until the end of next year.
However, legal actions against the tax have been launched throughout the
country by unions, business, and local governments.
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister, said yesterday that, if the
actions continued, the government would appeal to the Supreme Court.
In a further move to increase revenue, the government is hoping to change
the income tax structure to penalise the rich. The revenue service is
preparing to propose to Congress a new top tax of 35 per cent for those on
higher incomes. There are two tax rates now - 15 and 25 per cent.
