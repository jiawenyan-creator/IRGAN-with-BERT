  [Text] New Delhi, January 8 (XINHUA) -- India is seeking 
technical collaboration from China for modernization of its 
underground coal mines. 
  Speaking at a function on the occasion of 20 years of coal 
nationalization in India here on Friday [7 January], Indian 
Minister of State for Coal Ajit Panja said that the Ministry of 
Coal has already prepared a memorandum of understanding which is 
likely to be signed between India and China in Beijing next week. 
  Panja, who is leaving for Beijing today on a seven-day visit 
to China, said with China ranking as number one in underground 
coal mining technology, India would benefit by acquiring updated 
technical collaboration from that country. 
  He said that India would offer open-cast mining technology 
to 
China.
