  [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- The U.S. Government has 
extended an operation license for three Japanese airlines on six 
routes for 179 days until Dec. 5, the Transport Ministry said 
Wednesday [8 June]. 
  The license was due to expire Thursday. 
  The Japanese ministry also plans to extend similar license 
for five U.S. airlines on seven route until Oct. 29, ministry 
officials said. 
  This averted a total suspension of service by U.S. and 
Japanese airlines in the persistent aviation dispute arising 
from Washington's demand for expansion of rights to fly beyond 
Japan for American carriers. 
  The officials said the dispute remains unsettled because 
Japan still insists on restrictions on operations by U.S. 
airlines to third nations via Japan due to financial straits 
facing Japanese carriers. 
  The United States and Japan traded sanctions against 
respective airlines in March, cutting short their license 
periods.
