FT  03 MAR 92 / Army unit to quit disputed enclave
The former Soviet army prepared yesterday to withdraw a rifle regiment
caught up in the crossfire between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, Reuter reports.
A military convoy entered Stepanakert, the enclave's capital, to help in the
pullout of the 366th rifle regiment, which cousuffered three dead in recent
fighting. The pullout could usher in a new stage in the four-year conflict.
