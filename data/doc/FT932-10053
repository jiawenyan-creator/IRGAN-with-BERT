FT  11 MAY 93 / Observer: Modernising
Suggestions, please, for a replacement for one of Britain's most baffling
local authority names - Langbaurgh.
The name, which is Saxon for long barrow and refers to the Cleveland hills,
crept on to the map following the 1974 local government reorganisation. Its
pronunciation, and spelling, have caused bother ever since. Some people even
thought it was in Wales, prompting Langbaurgh council to slip in 'on-Tees' a
few years ago.
Now the Local Government Commission has said Langbaurgh should become a
unitary authority, but under a new name. One idea is Redcar Council. The
only problem is that the council offices are not in Redcar, but Eston, near
Middlesbrough. Suggestions on a postcard to the town clerk.
