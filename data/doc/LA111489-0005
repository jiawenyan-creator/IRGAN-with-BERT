LETTUCE WORKERS OK PACT, END STRIKE 
Lettuce workers represented by the Teamsters at Bud Antle Inc. went back to 
work in Huron, Santa Maria and Salinas, ending an 18-day strike. Union workers 
voted nearly 10 to 1 to accept a new three-year contract with Antle that 
includes an 8-cent hourly pay increase and other benefits. Some 3,000 Teamsters 
workers struck the Bud Antle lettuce operations in the three areas on Oct. 26 
after rejecting the company's original contract offer. Bud Antle officials 
refused to comment on the new pact, but union officials said that while it did 
not increase the previously rejected wage proposal, the new pact did provide 
for improvement in work hours and other benefits. Union officials said the 
contract was approved by a 2,240-248 vote.
