FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Ford warns of loss in European
operations
FORD, the US carmaker, has warned that its European operations will collapse
back into loss this year as it is forced to cut production in order to
reduce stock levels in the face of weakening sales.
The company has informed the US Securities and Exchange Commission that
over-optimistic dealer orders in Europe, which encouraged Ford to increase
production in the first half of the year, had exceeded retail sales.
It warned that European production would have to be cut in order 'to balance
dealer inventories with retail demand, which will result in a loss for the
year.'
The warning is a severe setback for Ford of Europe, which had struggled back
into profit in the first half of 1992 following last year's record loss.
In the first half of this year, Ford of Europe recovered to a net profit of
Dollars 108m, after plunging into a net loss for the whole of last year of
Dollars 1.079bn from a net profit of Dollars 145m in 1990 and a profit of
Dollars 1.19bn in 1989.
Ford said that the improvement in its earnings in the first and second
quarters had come from increases in its dealer inventories.
Without a recovery, inventory adjustments in Europe would limit further
improvements in total group earnings 'resulting in losses for the year in
markets outside the US.'
Further redundancies and production cuts were announced by Ford for its UK
plants yesterday, but Mr Lindsey Halstead, chairman of Ford of Europe, said
last night that 'there will be additional restructuring on a pan-European
basis.'
Mr Halstead said Ford of Europe had reduced its vehicle sales forecast for
Europe by 132,000 in the last six months, of which 80,000 was accounted for
by the UK.
'There is not a plant that has not reduced its workforce in the last six
months across Europe,' Mr Halstead said.
