BRIEFLY 
Consumer Credit Up at 7.2% Rate: Americans took out $4.24 billion more in 
consumer credit than they retired in November, the largest increase in their 
outstanding debt in nine months, the Federal Reserve reported. 
Some analysts said the jump reflected overall consumer optimism despite pockets 
of sluggishness in the economy. The Fed said consumer credit in November 
advanced at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.2% on top of a 5.4% gain in 
October. It was the highest level of consumer debt since last February, when 
$5.38 billion was posted.
