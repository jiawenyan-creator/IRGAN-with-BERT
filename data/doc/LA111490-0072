SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
A Rhode Island man pleaded guilty Tuesday to federal charges that he illegally 
obtained sensitive information about a drug-smuggling investigation from a U.S. 
Customs employee. Joseph Phillip Souza, 47, from Newport, R.I., could be 
sentenced to 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine when he is 
sentenced Dec. 20. 
According to a report from the U.S. attorney's office, Souza obtained the 
confidential information from Customs employee David Henry Brown, 48, of San 
Diego. The brief report released by the U.S. attorney's office did not note 
whether Brown was an agent, inspector or office worker with access to Custom's 
computer system. 
The information given to Souza was about an investigation of one of Souza's 
associates and was pilfered from the the agency's computer system. The U.S. 
attorney's report did not say if Brown was paid for the information or how long 
he worked for Customs. Efforts to reach officials at the U.S. attorney's office 
and Customs for more information were unsuccessful Tuesday night. 
Brown pleaded guilty Oct. 29 to charges of illegally transmitting confidential 
information to Souza. He also faces 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 
fine. He too will be sentenced Dec. 20.
