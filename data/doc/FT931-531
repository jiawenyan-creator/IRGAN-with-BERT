FT  30 MAR 93 / Jamaican voters set to back reform
JAMAICA votes today in a general election which opinion polls indicate will
give the incumbent People's National party a clear victory. This would hand
Mr P J Patterson, the prime minister, the mandate he is seeking to continue
economic reforms started four years ago.
Mr Edward Seaga, leader of the opposition Jamaica Labour party and a former
prime minister, has suggested, however, that the race will be closer than
many expect.
A poll published at the weekend gave the PNP a 7 point lead and possibly 44
of the 60 parliamentary seats at stake.
The three-week campaign has been marred by violence. Ten people have been
killed despite a code of conduct signed by political leaders committing all
candidates to restraining their supporters.
Mr Patterson called the election 11 months earlier than necessary,
apparently hoping to capitalise on dissent within the opposition. He took
over the premiership a year ago when Mr Michael Manley retired because of
poor health.
The electorate is being asked to decide on the style and form of the
economy's management, rather than economic direction. The PNP has switched
direction on economic policy, advocating and implementing free-market
initiatives with the divestment of state enterprises and deregulation of the
foreign exchange market.
Mr Seaga has argued, however, that the government has moved too far and too
fast in deregulating the economy. Flotation of the Jamaican dollar 18 months
ago was done too soon, he argues.
But the JLP's credibility was dented by a rebel faction attacking the
leadership. Most of the rebels are back in the fold but another election
defeat for Mr Seaga is likely to raise questions about his leadership.
