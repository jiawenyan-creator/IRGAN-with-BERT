FT  16 JUL 93 / Employers 'may offer unequal pensions'
THE European Court of Justice has received advice from its own Advocate
General that employers may offer unequal pensions to men and women if the
purpose is to offset inequalities in the state pension scheme.
The advice has particular significance for UK and Dutch employers who
frequently pay so-called 'bridging pensions' to those of their employees who
are eligible for occupational pension for several years before meeting the
minimum age for state pension benefits.
It means that British employers who gave more generous bridging pensions to
men or Dutch employers who gave them to women will not be required to
provide the same benefits for members of the opposite sex, saving
considerable costs to occupational schemes.
'From the employers' point of view this is good news,' said Mr John
Cunliffe, partner at solicitors McKenna and Co and an expert in pensions
law. 'But from the point of view of jurisprudence, its a nonsense,' he said.
While it is not certain that the ECJ will accept the advice of its Advocate
General, it is considered unusual for it not to do so.
ECJ Advocate General Mr Walter van Gervan, gave his opinion in the case of
Roberts v Birds Eye Walls, a case which originated in Britain on behalf of
Mrs Roberts, a 60-year old pensioner. In that case, Birds Eye Walls, the
ice-cream maker, paid so-called bridging pensions to those who retired
before reaching state retirement age. But because British women are eligible
to receive state pensions from age 60 while men must wait until 65, she
obtained a smaller bridging pension than a man in similar circumstances.
The UK government had surprised solicitors for all parties in the case by
intervening at the last moment. The UK government had argued that if the EC
were to agree that inequality in pension benefits is acceptable under some
circumstances, it would pave the way for applicants seeking exemptions on a
wide variety of grounds.
