SUMMARY:

 The Secretary amends the regulations governing institutional eligibility under the Higher Education Act of 1965,
as amended (HEA). The regulations implement new HEA statutory provisions that were added by the Higher Education
Amendments of 1992 and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993. In general, these new statutory provisions
tightened the eligibility requirements for institutions participating in the student financial assistance programs
authorized under title IV of the HEA (title IV, HEA programs). The regulations also clarify existing provisions,
and, in keeping with the statutory changes, tighten procedures governing institutional eligibility determinations.

 The Institutional Eligibility regulations contain requirements that apply to all postsecondary educational institutions

On February 10, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for this part in the 

Federal Register

, 59 FR 64466465. The NPRM included a discussion of major issues surrounding the proposed changes that will
not be repeated here. The following list summarizes those issues and identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM
on which a discussion of those issues can be found. 

Definitions in 600.2 (pages 64466447). 

Institution of higher education in 600.4 (pages 64476448). 

Proprietary institution of higher education in 600.5 
(pages 64486450). 

Conditions of institutional ineligibility in 600.7 
(pages 64506451).

Written agreement between an eligible institution and another institution or organization in 600.9 (page
6451). 

Date, extent, duration, and consequence of eligibility in 600.10 (pages 64516452). 

Special rules regarding institutional accreditation or preaccreditation in 600.11 (page 6452). 

Change in ownership resulting in a change of control in 600.31 (pages 64526454). 

Eligibility of additional locations in 600.32 (page 6454). 

Loss of eligibility in 600.40 (page 6454). 

Termination and emergency action proceedings in 600.41 
(page 6454). 

The following discussion describes the significant changes since publication of the NPRM and the manner in which
certain critical provisions will be initially implemented. They are discussed in the order in which they appear in
the text of the regulations. If a provision applies to more than one section or is included in more than one section,
it is discussed the first time it appears with an appropriate reference to its other appearances. 



Section 600.5Proprietary Institution of Higher Education



With regard to the two-year rule, the Secretary provides exceptions to the requirement that the program an institution
lists on its initial eligibility application be substantially the same as the program it offered for two years preceding
that application. An institution may satisfy the two-year rule even if it substantially changed the subject matter
of its program over the two-year period if that change was made because of new technology or the requirements of other
Federal agencies. In addition, an applicant institution may count as part of the two-year rule any period during which
it was a branch campus. 

These changes also apply to the two-year rule for postsecondary vocational institutions in 600.6. 

The Secretary changed the manner in which an institution calculates whether it satisfies the 85 percent rule. Instead
of determining the amount of title IV, HEA program funds it received over an award year and the amount of revenues it
received over a fiscal year in the fraction set forth in 600.5(d), institutions will use their latest fiscal
year to determine both amounts. Instead of determining the amount of title IV, HEA program funds received on a cash
basis of accounting and the amount of revenue received on an accrual basis of accounting, institutions will use a cash
basis of accounting for both title IV, HEA program funds and revenues. Institutions must report to the Department
of Education that they do not satisfy the 85 percent rule no later than 90 days after the last day of their fiscal year,
and institutions that fail to satisfy the 85 percent rule will become ineligible on the last day of their fiscal year.
