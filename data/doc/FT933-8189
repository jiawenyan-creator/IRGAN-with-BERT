FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Share exchange offer for Massa
METRO, the Swiss-based retail giant, is giving shareholders in Massa the
chance to exchange their shares for shares in Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus,
another quoted German retailer majority-owned by the privately-owned
Swiss-retailer.
Metro said this would give shareholders in the lossmaking Massa the
opportunity to participate directly in Asko, itself in the throes of
extensive rationalisation following Metro's purchase of a majority stake
last year.
At present, Massa is 65 per cent-owned by Metro and Asko via MHB Handel, a
holding company.
Analysts said the transaction was probably driven by tax considerations  -
the greater its stake in Massa the larger its potential write-off against
profits in other parts of a group which is estimated to have DM70bn (Dollars
40.6bn) turnover worldwide.
But Metro said yesterday that the move was appropriate in the light of
closer business co-operation between Asko and Massa.
Massa recently reported losses of DM51.5m for 1992 on turnover of DM5.24bn
after a net profit of DM17.5m in the previous year. The losses reflect
problems with aggressive expansion in credit-finance between 1985 and 1991.
This boosted sales of furniture and electronic equipment but led to heavy
losses. Mr Dietmar Mooslechner, chief executive, has said Massa would only
be fit to pay a dividend in 1994-1995.
Shares in Massa and Asko were suspended yesterday at DM170.50 and DM790
respectively.
The offer is one share in Asko in exchange for four shares in Massa. The
Asko shares will come from Metro's own holding in the company.
