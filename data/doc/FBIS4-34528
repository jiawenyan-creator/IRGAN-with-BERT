<F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Ernesto Samper by reporter </F>
Ana Fernanda Valderama and unidentified station announcers at 
Samper's apartment in Bogota, Colombia; from the "National 
Newscast" -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] In his few hours as president-elect, 
Ernesto Samper has begun explaining what his administration's 
course of action will be. Meanwhile, speculation has begun 
about his administration. The "National Newscast" consulted a 
specialist in predictions. He is astrologist Mauricio Puerta, 
who a year ago predicted Samper's victory by a close vote as 
occurred yesterday. 
  [Begin Puerta recording] House No. 10 is the house of power. 
You see he was born with Saturn in House 10. Saturn is 
responsibilities and achievements. He has made efforts. Today, 
he is in house four, which is the fatherland, over Jupiter. 
Jupiter, which is his birth, in astrology is culture and if 
Saturn is time, then this is the time for culture. But 
Sagittarius is religion and Pluto goes around every 250 years. 
In other words, Pluto was also in Sagittarius and that was 
called the Inquisition. That is why some of the biggest 
problems the new administration will have to face are problems 
with the church. [passage omitted] [end recording] 
  [Announcer] We now have direct contact with president-elect 
Ernesto Samper Pizano. Ana Fernanda Valderama is at his 
apartment where the plans of the new government are being drawn 
up. Go ahead Ana: 
  [Valderama] Good afternoon Maria Beatriz, president-elect 
Ernesto Samper was watching the "National Newcast" showing the 
astrology card drawn up by Mauricio Puerta. You are going to 
have a lot of problems with cassocks. In fact, you had some at 
the end of your campaign. How are you going to overcome them? 
  [Samper] In the first place, I hope they are isolated 
problems, not a general problem. What occurred in the campaign 
was in no way a confrontation with the church, with all the 
cassocks, but with some isolated members who made their call to 
religious fanaticism felt. Moreover, I think part of the 
support I received yesterday was support in favor of tolerance 
and against religious war. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, 
that prediction by Mauricio Puerta is going to refer exclusively 
to some isolated cases. 
  [Valderama] Well, Dr. Samper, it seems there is a question 
from the "National Newscast" studios. 
  [Announcer] That is right Maria Fernanda, but first we are 
going to ask Dr. Samper to watch the following report because it 
has not been 24 hours since he was declared the winner and some 
people have already begun to settle accounts. We invite him to 
watch this initial settling of accounts from the coast and later 
we will ask him a question. 
  [Begin recording] [Senator Juan Jose Garcia] Let us hope 
that 
Samper will give us what Dr. Lopez gave us. The Atlantic coast 
also elected him. He gave us three ministries: Public Works, 
Health, and Agriculture. 
  [Senator Carlos Espinoza in progress]...national planning. 
Because if we only had national planning, we could have an 
influence on the decisions by the state to promote development. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What about the number of ministries? 
  [Espinoza] There must be at least three or four ministers 
from the coast. 
  [Senator Eugenio Diaz] At the Senate's proposal, Dr. Samper 
Pizano went to [word indistinct]. He promised us an advisory 
office for the Atlantic coast. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Well, Dr. Samper you have heard the proposals 
and 
expectations from the coast. Will your cabinet respond to these 
invitations or will it simply be a technical cabinet that 
responds to Colombian's needs? 
  [Samper] Well, it is not going to be a technical cabinet. It 
will be a cabinet of technicians with political responsibility. 
I am sure that many valuable people from the coast fulfill both 
conditions. In other words, they will have the technical 
training required for such a high position and they will also 
have the ability to assume a political commitment because that 
is what this requires. Of course, the coast is going to be 
represented in my cabinet. It is one of the most important 
regions in the country. In my campaign program, the coast had 
and will continue to have a fundamental role in my 
administration. This includes the recovery of its agricultural 
sector and the consolidation of its infrastructure, above all, 
the increase of social infrastructure through public services 
such as health, education, and housing. In 12 hours, things 
have not changed for me. I maintain the promises I made to the 
coast. We are going to work actively so the coast will not only 
be represented in government positions but essentially in my 
administration's development plan. 
  [Announcer] But Dr. Samper, numerically how many positions 
will the coast obtain? 
  [Samper] No, I do not think you can look at this just 
through 
quotas of two, three, or five. I want to bring people who are 
representative of the Caribbean coast so they can be involved in 
a government program in which the Caribbean will of course have 
a fundamental role. 
  [Announcer] Shortly before 2100, five hours after the polls 
closed, Andres Pastrana acknowledged the Liberal Party's 
victory. From the tone of his speech, analysts have begun to 
think that the decision of the losing candidate is to go to the 
opposition. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Pastrana] I want to congratulate Ernesto 
Samper for his election as president of the Republic. [cheers] 
I assured the country a president who has received money from 
drug trafficking has no moral right to lead Colombia. We will 
continue to oppose with all our strength the legalization of 
drugs. 
  [Unidentified reporter] With these words, Andres Pastrana 
makes one think that he will become the biggest opponent of the 
Samper administration. He is backed by 3.5 million votes, 
enough to consolidate a real political force around him. 
Analysts think several paths are open to Pastrana. 
  [Political expert Fernando Cepeda] I think Colombian 
democracy will benefit from having someone in the opposition. 
  [Reporter] Others think this is not the candidate's style. 
  [Political expert Rodrigo Lozada] I do not think Pastrana 
will choose the alternative of carrying out a hard line 
opposition to the Samper administration. I do not think it 
corresponds with Pastrana's style. 
  [Reporter] Participation in the government party is another 
possibility for the defeated candidate. 
  [Political expert Eduardo Pizano] He can seek a very 
important partnership with the government, seek a government of 
national unity with strong participation in the cabinet. 
  [Reporter] What everyone agrees on is that if Pastrana's 
opinions continue with the same characteristics as yesterday's 
speech, there will be a real force of opposition to the ruling 
party for the first time in many years. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Well, Dr. Samper, we have heard the opinions of 
some analysts who believe it is better for Pastrana to be in the 
opposition. What do you offer him? Do you offer cooperation 
with your administration? Will you receive him to participate 
in your administration or would you prefer, as some analysts 
say, that he stay in the opposition? 
  [Samper] I believe Andres Pastrana won a very important 
position yesterday. He obtained significant voting results 
yesterday. The decision as to whether or not he decides to 
cooperate, whether or not he deems it advisable for the position 
he has opened to engage or not in my administration depends, 
first of all, on the analysis they make of what their 
relationship should be with the government. For my part, I am 
ready to consider the decision they make, whether it be to 
remain in the opposition or to engage in working in a government 
of national unity, in view of the important number of votes 
obtained by both candidates yesterday. 
  [Announcer] Thank you Dr. Samper, we invite you to stay with 
us. We will continue to analyze yesterday's elections. The 
principal novelty yesterday was the high voter turnout. It was 
the highest voter turnout recorded in presidential elections in 
Colombia. Contrary to all the predictions that there would be 
increased abstentionism, 7.3 million Colombians went to vote. 
Abstentionism dropped from 66 percent in the primary elections 
to approximately 50 percent. That is 2 million votes more than 
on 29 May. These votes were distributed fairly, equally between 
the two candidates because the difference was 120,000 votes. 
This newscast consulted several newsmen to find out what they 
expect of Samper's administration and how they will judge him. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] What do you expect of Ernesto 
Samper's administration? 
  [Columnist Jorge Child] I hope he will fulfill two basic 
promises. The one on social investment to increase jobs and the 
one on Latin American integration, which includes, of course, 
Cuba's admission to the OAS. 
  [Columnist Maria Teresa Herran] I hope that he will fulfill 
his campaign promises. 
  [Columnist Juan Gabrial Uribe] Yes, I think that Dr. Ernesto 
Samper can lead a good peace-keeping process in Colombia. 
  [Reporter] How will you carry out your watchdog activities 
of 
his government? 
  [Child] If he strays from his promises, if he engages in 
influence peddling, if he does not keep his promises to suspend 
privatizations, if he is not successful in his social policy, we 
will most certainly organize an opposition movement. 
  [Herran] He has promised to create [words indistinct] jobs. 
We will have to conduct a follow-up on how they are going to be 
created and how many will be created the first year. 
  [Uribe] We will conduct watchdog activities to ensure that 
what he has said about a fight against corruption is fulfilled. 
[end recording] 
  [Announcer] Well, Dr. Samper, you have heard that the 
columnists are going to keep an eye on you to see whether you 
fulfill your campaign promises, particularly the fight against 
corruption and your promise to create jobs. What is your answer 
to them? 
  [Samper] Basically, that I am disposed as a government 
leader 
to give them all the guarantees they require to conduct their 
watchdog activities. I think what a government needs most is a 
free and independent press, which can closely follow all 
government actions. I am very pleased with what the important 
columnists have said. 
  [Valderama] Well, Dr. Samper, the last question for you is 
what will be the first actions of your government on 8 August? 
  [Samper] On 7 August. [laughs] In addition to appointing the 
cabinet, I am thinking of promulgating some decrees to 
reactivate the agricultural sector because I have an affective 
and effective commitment to the recovery of that sector. 
  [Valderama] Thank you very much, Dr. Ernesto Samper, 
Colombian president-elect. This has been all the information we 
have from the home of Dr. Ernesto Samper.
