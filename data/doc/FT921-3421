FT  14 MAR 92 / International Company News: Scitex buys US maker of image
systems
SCITEX, the Israeli manufacturer of colour electronic pre-press equipment,
has moved to deepen its penetration of the US newspaper, magazine and
corporate publishing markets by buying a Massachusetts-based maker of
photo-scanning and transmission systems.
Scitex has agreed to pay Dollars 35m, plus unspecified performance-related
payments over the next two years, for 100 per cent of Leaf Systems.
Leaf, which has a strategic partnership with Associated Press, the US news
agency, has installations at more than 1,000 newspapers, mainly in the US.
Leaf and Scitex intend to benefit from the combination of their respective
expertise in photo and graphic-imaging technologies.
Mr Arie Rosenfeld, Scitex's chief executive, said the agreement would help
his company achieve a spread of products for publishers 'from design and
creation through colour separation to final print'.
Scitex, which last month announced a 31 per cent increase in profits in 1991
to just over Dollars 100m, had cash reserves at the end of last year of
Dollars 150m.
