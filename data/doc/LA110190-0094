VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI; 
MAN TO STAND TRIAL IN WOMAN'S SLAYING 
A Lake County man was ordered Wednesday to stand trial on charges that he 
murdered a traveling companion whose decomposed body was found in Matilija 
Canyon near Ojai in 1986. 
Ventura County Municipal Judge Bruce A. Clark held Thomas Gottchalk, 49, to 
answer charges that he shot Jean Ellen Eubanks, 34, twice in the head and left 
her body under a crude cairn in the canyon. 
Gottchalk is being held in lieu of $500,000 bail in Ventura County Jail pending 
arraignment in Superior Court, which is scheduled for Nov. 14. 
Earlier Wednesday, firearms experts testified that the two .25-caliber bullets 
found in Eubanks' body came from the same kind of gun that her daughter, 
Jeanine Copus, testified she saw in Gottchalk's van just after her mother 
disappeared on July 31, 1986. 
However, no murder weapon has been found, Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Holmes 
said. MACK REED
