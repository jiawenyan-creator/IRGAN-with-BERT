  [Text] Beijing, May 23 (CNS) -- The Minister of Finance 
Mr. Liu Zhongli said that imposition of land added value tax had 
to take place because it was a decree issued by the State 
Council. 
  Mr. Liu said recently that such tax had to be levied in 
various regions, and no alternative policy was possible in 
localities. He added that opinion and proposals on the land 
added value tax offered by some regions would be taken into 
consideration by the state when it worked out detailed 
regulations for the implementation. 
  The minister, however, said that the time table for 
formulation of the regulations had not yet been finalized. He 
added that such taxation was considered an effective measure to 
curb occupation of land on one's own for exploitation, land 
speculation and flat speculation. The state, however, would 
lend its support to construction of housing and development of 
real estate. 
  There are to date some 60 countries and regions to impose 
direct tax on revenue resulting from the transfer of land and in 
some cases tax is also levied on revenue obtained from buildings 
standing on it.
