FT  16 DEC 92 / Brazil sets back sale of state companies
PRESIDENT Itamar Franco has temporarily suspended Brazil's privatisation
programme to 'review the rules' in a move many investors are interpreting as
the new government's first real step away from modernisation.
The shock decision comes two days after neighbouring Uruguay voted heavily
against privatisation. It has sparked fears of a return to a more
nationalist policy and contradicts the government's promise to go ahead with
all sales scheduled until March.
Although Mr Franco insisted the programme would continue and set new dates
for sales in March and April, the main Sao Paulo index fell 4.3 per cent.
The price of Brazilian debt on the secondary market also dropped - from 28
cents on the dollar to just 26.5 cents within an hour, almost half what it
was six months ago.
Mr Franco is a past critic of privatisation and the programme has been in
doubt since taking office in September after Congress removed his
predecessor, Mr Fernando Collor. He has already cancelled one sale.
The decision means delaying six scheduled sales, including next Tuesday's
auction of the National Steel company (CSN), which would have been the
largest privatisation to date, valued at Dollars 1.6bn. It follows
allegations that CSN directors were benefiting personally from the sale.
Yesterday the company president was sacked. The sale is now scheduled for
April 5.
The Privatisation Commission has been given five days to elaborate new
rules. These are expected to include a new 30 per cent minimum cash
requirement.
Mr Franco said the object of the review was 'to protect the national wealth
of the Brazilian people' and insisted the programme was 'irreversible'.
