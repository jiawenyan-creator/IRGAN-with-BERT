FT  14 SEP 92 / Instability sends Zairean currency into free fall
ZAIRE'S currency is in free fall as a result of continuing political
instability and economic mismanagement in Africa's second biggest nation.
The nose dive of the zaire reflects the inability of Zaire's feeble central
authority to resuscitate the mineral-rich economy and restore political
stability after army-led looting wrecked Kinshasa and other towns in
September and October last year.
This month alone the zaire has fallen by more than 30 per cent against the
US dollar from Z690,000 to Z1m. The increasingly rapid depreciation of the
zaire followed a move by the Central Bank to inject Z8bn into the system at
the beginning of the month. Exactly 12 months ago the zaire was trading at
Z18,000 to the dollar.
Given the scale of the currency crisis the Bank of Zaire has been constantly
printing bigger-denomination notes and earlier this month was forced to
introduce a Z1m one million zaire note.
At the moment there appears little sign of a recovery and the return of
several thousand western businessmen who fled the violence last year until a
stable political authority is installed. Western donors are also waiting for
guarantees of economic reforms and discipline before restoring aid flows.
A government created in August by a pro-democracy conference and led by Mr
Etienne Tshisekedi, a seasoned opponent of President Mobutu Sese Seko, has
been paralysed. Leaders of the mineral-rich province of Shaba, which tried
to secede from the country during the Katanga crisis of the early 1960s,
have said they will not recognise it.
The new government has promised to call early multi-party elections and
President Mobutu, widely viewed as personally responsible for the chaos of
the country, has said he will stand as a presidential candidate.
