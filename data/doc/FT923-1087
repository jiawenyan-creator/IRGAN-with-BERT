FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Zuckerman ahead in battle for
Daily News
CREDITORS have dropped their objections to Mr Mortimer Zuckerman's bid to
buy the Daily News, leaving only one union standing between him and
ownership of the New York tabloid, AP-DJ reports.
At a US bankruptcy court hearing on his offer he also won the right to
compensation in case the sale falls through - a further indication of the
strength of his bid.
Under a sale agreement presented by the Daily News, Mr Zuckerman - who owns
US News and World Report magazine - would pay Dollars 36.3m for the paper,
including Dollars 18.25m to its creditors. That would give them 13 cents to
17 cents on the dollar for their claims against the Daily News - far less
than a competing offer from the Whitman Group that would provide more than
33 cents on the dollar.
But Mr Zuckerman's offer is considered more viable as he has deals with
eight of the paper's nine unions. Their co-operation is essential in any
deal to sell the paper.
He has yet to reach a deal with the Newspaper Guild. Its president Mr Barry
Lipton said Mr Zuckerman was the most likely candidate to own the paper but
said: 'It can't really finish unless we're on board. Zuckerman is going to
need to come to an acceptable conclusion with us.'
