  [Text] The Australian Government has called in China's 
ambassador to Australia to protest last week's nuclear test by 
China. Camille Funnell reports that the Chinese envoy was 
summoned by Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 
  [Funnell] Australian officials say that ambassador Chunlai 
Shi was told Canberra strongly protested the underground 
explosion on 10 June. Officials say the ambassador was reminded 
Australia was one of the countries that protested China's last 
nuclear test in October 1993. The ambassador was told China's 
latest test was out of step with efforts to negotiate a 
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, with China's own support 
for nuclear disarmament, and also with its commitment to 
negotiate a comprehensive test ban treaty by 1996.
