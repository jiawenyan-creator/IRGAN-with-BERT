FT  08 FEB 94 / EU trade talks with Ukraine
Foreign ministers of the European Union were last night poised to give the
green light for talks on a more generous trade agreement with Ukraine to be
concluded before next month's elections there, writes Lionel Barber in
Brussels.
The proposed agreement is viewed as a tool for strengthening the hands of
moderates in the former Soviet republic as they struggle to prevent the
disintegration of the economy and the rise of nationalism.
