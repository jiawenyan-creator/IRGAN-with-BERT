Background 



Pursuant to a bilateral agreement, the United States has agreed to restrict, within its regulatory framework of 27
CFR 5.22, the use of the product designations ``Scotch whisky,'' ``Irish whisky/Irish whiskey,'' ``Cognac,'' ``Armagnac,''
``Calvados,'' and ``Brandy de Jerez'' to distilled spirits products produced in certain Member States of the EU.
Under the agreement, the EU agreed to restrict, within its regulatory framework of Council Regulation (EU) No. 1576/89,
the use of the product designations ``Tennessee whisky/Tennessee whiskey,'' ``Bourbon whisky/Bourbon whiskey,''
and ``Bourbon'' to distilled spirits products of the United States. In both situations, the products remain subject
to all of the labeling requirements of the United States and the EU, respectively. 

In implementing the bilateral agreement, the United States believes that an administrative interpretation of the
existing regulations is sufficient to afford the restrictive recognition required by the agreement for ``Armagnac,''
``Calvados,'' and ``Brandy de Jerez.'' The reference to administrative measures in the agreement authorizes the
ruling approach for implementing the agreement. 

The regulations currently provide restrictive recognition to ``Irish whisky/Irish whiskey,'' ``Scotch whisky,''
and ``Cognac.'' 

The ruling will appear in a future issue of the ATF bulletin. The full and exact text of the ATF Ruling follows for the
information and reference of the industry and the public.

ATF Ruling 945 



27 CFR 5.22(k)(3): Class 11; geographical designations. 



The requirements in 27 CFR 5.22(k)(3) provide that geographical names that are not names for distinctive types of
distilled spirits, and that have not become generic, shall not be applied to distilled spirits produced in any other
place than the particular place or region indicated in the name. The names ``Armagnac,'' ``Calvados,'' and ``Brandy
de Jerez'' are geographical names within section 5.22(k)(3) and shall not apply to distilled spirits products other
than those produced in the particular place or region indicated by such names. Further, such ``Armagnac'' (France),
``Calvados'' (France), and ``Brandy de Jerez'' (Spain) must be produced in accordance with the regulations of the
European Union and the laws of the Member States in which those products originate.



In recent negotiations concluding in an exchange of letters between the United States (US) and European Union (EU)
regarding distilled spirits, the US agreed to restrict, within its regulatory framework of 27 CFR 5.22 (or equivalent
successor regulation) the use of the product designations ``Armagnac,'' ``Calvados,'' ``Cognac,'' ``Brandy de
Jerez,'' ``Irish whisky/Irish whiskey,'' and ``Scotch whisky'' to distilled spirits products of the Member States
of the EU, produced in compliance with Council Regulation (EU) No. 1576/89 and with the laws of the Member States in
which those products originate. Further, it is recognized that these products shall continue to be subject to all
of the labeling requirements of the US for products imported into the US. 

In like manner, the EU agreed to restrict, within its regulatory framework of Council Regulation (EU) No. 1576/89,
Article 11 (or equivalent successor regulation), the use of the product designations ``Bourbon,'' ``Bourbon whisky/Bourbon
whiskey,'' and ``Tennessee whisky/Tennessee whiskey,'' to distilled spirits products of the US, produced in compliance
with the laws and regulations (27 CFR 5.22 or equivalent successor regulation) of the US. Further, it is recognized
that these products shall continue to be subject to all of the labeling requirements of the EU for products imported
into the EU. 

The names ``Cognac,'' ``Irish whisky/Irish whiskey,'' and ``Scotch whisky'' are already restricted to products
of France, Republic of Ireland or in Northern Ireland, and Scotland, respectively, by the standard of identity regulations
for distilled spirits in 27 CFR 5.22. 

Section 5.22(k)(3) of the distilled spirits regulations establishes a standard of identity for products having
geographical designations. Under this section, geographical names that are not distinctive types of distilled
spirits, and that have not become generic, shall not be applied to distilled spirits produced in any other place than
the particular place or region indicated in the name. 



Held: 

The names ``Armagnac,'' ``Calvados,'' and ``Brandy de Jerez'' are geographical designations within section 5.22(k)(3)
and shall not apply to distilled spirits products other than those produced in the particular place or region indicated
by such name. Further, such ``Armagnac'' (France), ``Calvados'' (France), and ``Brandy de Jerez'' (Spain) must
be produced in accordance with regulations of the EU and the laws of the Member States in which those products originate.




Held further: 

``Armagnac,'' ``Calvados,'' ``Cognac,'' ``Brandy de Jerez,'' ``Irish whisky/Irish whiskey,'' and ``Scotch whisky''
imported into the US shall continue to be subject to all of the labeling requirements for distilled spirits under 27
CFR Part 5.
