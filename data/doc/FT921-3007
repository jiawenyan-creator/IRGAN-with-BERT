FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Renold ready for bid from TT
Renold, a maker of chains and gears for power transmission equipment, has
got its retaliation in early against a possible hostile bid from TT Group,
writes Jane Fuller.
In response to TT taking a 2.9 per cent stake, Renold warned that the
acquisitive industrial holding company might try to acquire it 'on the cheap
at the lowest point in the economic cycle'. It advised shareholders not to
sell.
The share price promptly rose by more than 20 per cent to 55 1/2 p, a market
value of Pounds 36.4m, but not before TT had taken its stake to 4.6 per
cent. Mr John Newman, a director of TT, said the purchases were 'just an
investment'.
Renold said yesterday the full-year pre-tax deficit would not exceed Pounds
3.5m, after exceptional charges of Pounds 1.5m.
