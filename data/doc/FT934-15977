FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Lamont doubles to Pounds 4.05m
SHARES IN Lamont Holdings climbed 15p to 384p as the Northern Ireland-based
carpets and textiles group announced almost doubled pre-tax profits in the
six months to June 30.
On turnover ahead to Pounds 65.8m (Pounds 52.6m), including Pounds 3.18m
(Pounds 4.25m) from discontinued operations - pre-tax profits jumped to
Pounds 4.05m (Pounds 2.18m). The figure would have been higher but for
exceptional charges of Pounds 643,000 relating to the disposal of the
computer division and an increase in net interest payable to Pounds 449,000
(Pounds 40,000).
Sir Desmond Lorimer, chairman, said the increased interest charge derived
from the assumption of the Pounds 7m debt of Rochdale-based Alexander Drew,
the furnishing fabric printer acquired for an initial Pounds 16.4m in April
1992.
The non-carpet textiles side had operating profits of Pounds 5.43m (Pounds
1.5m) on turnover of Pounds 38.1m (Pounds 25.5m). Sir Desmond said that some
Pounds 2.5m of the profits came from Drew.
In the carpets division, of which Shaw Carpets has been responsible for the
group's declining fortunes of late, turnover rose to Pounds 23.4m (Pounds
21.8m) and operating profits of Pounds 81,000 last time turned to losses of
Pounds 660,000 after Pounds 433,000 (Pounds 109,000) redundancy costs at
Shaw.
Shaw, which Sir Desmond said served the middle market, had lost market share
in a disruptive Pounds 4m capital expenditure programme. He expected it to
return to profitability in 1994. However, at the lower end of the market,
Northern Ireland Carpets had lifted sales 16 per cent.
Shifting the property interests into a joint venture - which retained Pounds
3m - had improved cashflow by some Pounds 6.5m and helped Lamont back to its
textiles core, where Sir Desmond said it would look for bolt-on
acquisitions.
The interim dividend is held at 3.5p, payable from earnings of 8.48p (5.61p)
per share.
