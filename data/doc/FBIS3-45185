<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wu Yunhe: "Agriculture to Get More </F>
Loans"] 
  [Text] The Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) said yesterday 
at least 10 percent of the country's bank loans should flow into 
the cash-starved agricultural sector this year. 
  The ABC also plans to put forward the suggestion at a 
six-day 
national conference on financial work that opened today with 
participants from all of the country's banks. 
  Last year, only 6 percent of the loans from the country's 
banks were channeled into agriculture, lagging far behind the 
needs in the countryside, said an official with the bank. 
  Bank officials said the ABC will, this year, intensify its 
financial backing for township factories engaged in 
manufacturing high-value-added export products as well as to 
poverty-alleviation projects in remote areas. 
  It lent more than 335.3 billion yuan ($39 billion) to the 
country's township enterprises last year to help them to expand, 
up 63.8 billion yuan ($7.4 billion) from 1992. 
  By the end of last year, ABC's various savings deposits hit 
827.9 billion yuan ($96.3 billion), up 157.2 billion yuan ($18.3 
billion) from the beginning of 1993. 
  Of the total, individual savings accounted for 610.2 billion 
yuan ($71 billion), 126.3 billion yuan ($14.7 billion) higher 
than at the end of 1992. 
  Strong growth in savings deposits enabled the bank to 
increase its lending earmarked for the country's agricultural 
development. 
  Since the central government started its credit-tightening 
policy in June last year, the bank has recalled 5.8 billion yuan 
($674 million) of its inter-bank borrowing to support the rural 
economy. 
  The recalling of the inter-bank borrowing by the bank has 
effectively restricted its non-banking financial companies' 
speculative activities in the country's real estate and stock 
markets. 
  In a firm response to the government's call for strong 
backing of the rural economy, the ABC disbursed nearly 233 
billion yuan ($27 billion) in loans for agricultural production 
last year, up 38 billion yuan ($4.4 billion) from the previous 
year.
