SEA WORLD HOLIDAY BOWL; 
AT LONG LAST, TY'S HEISMAN CAME CALLING; 
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY QUARTERBACK DETMER NEVER LET THE 
CRUNCH AFFECT HIM -- AND HIS ROOMMATES MADE SURE HE STAYED HUMBLE. 
Ring! 
The telephone. It kept . . . 
 Ring! 
 Ringing. 
 Ring! 
 All through the day, and into the night. 
Girls. Guys. Kids. Wanting to hear that voice. Ty's voice. 
Usually, Ty Detmer and his four roommates would take the calls in stride. The 
Heisman Trophy hype had started in the summer, and they were still young. None 
of them had ever been through anything like this before. How bad could it get, 
really? 
There were times when they were amused by the whole scene. It was fall. They 
liked fall. It was football season, and this Heisman stuff was kind of a kick. 
Until they would try to sleep in on a Sunday after getting back from a road 
trip late Saturday. These were the times when they felt like ripping the phone 
out of the wall and tossing it out the window. 
It never stopped. Owning their number became a status symbol in Provo, Utah, 
like having the latest pair of Nikes. 
"I don't know, a student-teacher at a high school told us he saw a girl walking 
down the hall saying 'I got Ty Detmer's phone number,' and passing it out," 
said David Henderson, one of Detmer's roommates and a second-team defensive 
back. "We got so many hang-ups." 
At its peak, the house answering machine was taking about 100 calls a day. 
Incredibly, BYU student information was giving out Detmer's phone number to 
anyone who asked. Henderson said the roommates called information and asked the 
campus operator to stop giving it out, and he said he would post a note. 
That was a couple of days before BYU stunned then-No.1 Miami in Provo. By the 
end of that game, it was apparent that this would not be a normal year in 
Provo. Ty Detmer became the Heisman front-runner. 
A couple of days after the Miami game, Henderson said they again called BYU 
information. This time they simply asked for Ty's number. They got it. No 
problem, thank you for using BY &amp; U. So much for posting a note. 
Two weeks ago, it finally got to be too much. Detmer and his roommates, a bit 
older and wiser, had their phone number changed to an unlisted one. 
But they couldn't very easily change their doorbell. 
 Ring! 
 The five of them -- four football players and a wrestler -- live in a rented 
house in what once was a quiet neighborhood. Lots of families. Lots of kids. 
"The kids go to school and tell their friends they know where Ty Detmer lives," 
Henderson said. 
 Ring! 
 "According to them, the other kids don't believe them, so they want 
autographs." 
They also want to play football in the front yard. During the season, Detmer 
and Co. rarely had time to do so. Once the season is finished, though, 
Henderson said, they play more frequently. 
Soon, there will be games in the front yard. This week, though, the 
neighborhood turns its attention from the house down the street to San Diego. 
The Heisman Trophy winner arrives in town this afternoon, and San Diegans are 
getting spoiled. Not only does the Holiday Bowl have a history of nail-biting 
finishes, now, it has a Heisman history. Barry Sanders two years ago, now 
Detmer. Two winners in three bowl games. And Detmer played last year as well. 
Not bad. 
Thanks to a shy, polite, mischievous, 22-year-old quarterback who could just as 
easily fit into a Boy Scout troop, this has been one of the wildest and 
craziest seasons in BYU history. According to BYU's sports information people, 
no other athlete in BYU history has generated this much interest. Not Jim 
McMahon. Not Steve Young. Not Robbie Bosco or Michael Smith or Danny Ainge. 
Nobody. 
The madness began during the summer, with the manufacturing of Heisman "ties" 
and the plotting of the hype. It was the Miami game that turned Provo inside 
out. But Detmer's solid-gold season opened a week before Miami, in his native 
Texas . . . 
Sept. 1, in El Paso, Tex. 
BYU 30, Texas El Paso 10 
Imagine. You are a shy college student who loves playing football. You also 
love to hunt, because it gets you out into the woods, away from the daily grind 
and limelight. You are the focus of your team, and nearly every time you step 
into a room, people know who you are. 
You are in El Paso, and these wacky BYU fans are wearing blue ties with your 
name and No. 14 on them. Heisman Tys. 
You are getting ready to open the season in the midst of all of this madness. 
And then, while standing in the lobby of the team hotel, you see your mother 
heading toward you . . . and she is wearing a big button on her blouse. The 
button has your picture on it. 
"A head shot," Henderson said. 
Oh, mercy. 
Betty Detmer had flown in from the family home in Mission, Tex. What with her 
husband and another son involved with high school football, and one daughter in 
school and the other married, it would be her only chance to see Ty play in 
person this season. 
It was an interesting opening, and not only because Detmer passed for 387 
yards. He surprised BYU Coach LaVell Edwards by getting an unsportsmanlike 
conduct penalty. Later, there was a brawl, and one of the Texas papers splashed 
a big picture of Ty in the middle of the fight across the page. 
"Mild-mannered Ty was pictured fixin' to slug someone," Betty said. "He had 
some guy by the face mask. Koy (Ty's 17-year-old brother) loved it." 
Today, that picture hangs on the bulletin board of Koy's room. 
The Heisman Tour '90 was off to a rousing start. 
Sept. 8, in Provo 
BYU 28, Miami 21 
Nighttime. There is a big, white "Y" on a mountaintop overlooking Provo. 
Somebody makes his way toward it. A "T" is planted in front of the "Y". All set 
for game day. 
"Half the people thought this was our first game," Detmer said. "It was really 
big. Students on campus wished you good luck everywhere you went." 
This was a turning point as far as the Heisman race was concerned. Detmer 
completed a season-high 38 of 54 passes for 406 yards and three touchdowns in 
front of a sellout crowd and national ESPN audience. He did this despite 
receiving a cut on his chin that took six stitches. 
Ring! In Mission, the Detmer family's phone rang all that night and the next 
day. Friends, relatives . . . excitement. 
Ring! Ty called the next day. 
"He was just elated when we talked to him," Betty Detmer said. "I don't think 
his chin even hurt." 
Sept. 15, in Provo 
BYU 50, Washington State 36 
To win the Heisman, you need several things: Talent. Publicity. Statistics. And 
maybe a little bit of magic. 
Against Washington State, Detmer had it all. 
Miami week was over, and talk about letdowns: BYU trailed at halftime, 29-7. 
Suddenly, Detmer threw three fourth-quarter touchdowns and led a comeback. He 
finished with 448 yards passing and five touchdown passes. His legend was 
sealed. 
The Heisman is also timing. The Cougars were scheduled to appear on CBS against 
San Diego State the next week, and because of that, CBS had a crew there for 
this game. 
"The CBS crew was there, and they kept feeding updates back to the stations," 
BYU Coach LaVell Edwards said. "You couldn't have written a better script." 
Meanwhile, no need to worry about Detmer's ego with his roommates around. They 
kid him so much there is no way Detmer can get a big head. Hubert, they call 
him. That is Ty's middle name. Hubert. After his grandfather. 
"It's really good for Ty to live with those guys," Betty Detmer said. 
Sept. 22, in Provo 
BYU 62, San Diego State 34 
An hour before game time. Detmer is loosening up by taking snaps and rolling 
right and then left. You've heard of the two-step drop? Well, a CBS cameraman 
is about two steps from Detmer, filming everything. 
Interest in Detmer was so high that CBS decided to show this game to about 80% 
of the nation. It was originally scheduled as a regional game. 
Meanwhile, it turns out, Detmer's roommates aren't the only ones who get on him 
about the Heisman stuff. His father, Sonny, usually lets him have it during his 
one or two calls home each week. When Ty calls, he answers the phone, "Stud." 
That always gets a laugh. 
There have been quite a few serious moments, too. Ty had been depressed after 
the UTEP game. He didn't think he played well. Imagine passing for 387 yards 
and one touchdown and not thinking you played well. 
"If it is not any fun any more, you need to find something else to do," Sonny 
told Ty then. 
After playing well against Miami and Washington State, Ty shredded SDSU for 514 
yards. 
Now, it was fun again. 
Sept. 29, in Eugene, Ore. 
Oregon 32, BYU 16 
His hand ached. His right hand. The passing one. He had banged it on a helmet 
against Washington State, and then dinged it again against SDSU. Detmer didn't 
practice all week because of an injured hand. It showed. Five of his passes 
were intercepted. 
"Ty died in Eugene," screamed the broadcasters. 
By the end of the season, 28 of Detmer's passes were be intercepted, and each 
Heisman watcher had his own opinion. Detmer may have handled the predictions 
better than his mother. 
"One day it's 'St. Ty of the Football,' so much glory he could do no wrong," 
Betty Detmer said. "The next day, it's 'He's only 5-11 and can't throw the 
football more than 20 yards, and it's all wobbly.' I'd be so mad I could just 
spit." 
As if the loss and five interceptions weren't enough, one of Detmer's 
roommates, Rick Evans -- the wrestler -- is from Oregon. All week, he had been 
talking about Oregon. 
"Oregon guys are tougher than guys from Texas," he told Detmer and Henderson, 
both of whom are from Texas. 
When the team got back and Detmer returned to the house, Evans just sat there. 
Grinning. 
Oct. 6, in the mountains 
By mid-December, many of the weekends would become a blur to Detmer. Not this 
one. 
"Got an elk that weekend," he said. 
With a week off, his hand was placed in a removable cast. He removed the cast 
long enough to go hunting. 
The Detmer family joke is that one reason they don't go to a psychiatrist is 
that they spend time in the woods. Quiet time, where they can sort out their 
thoughts and feelings. 
Oct. 13, in Provo 
BYU 52, Colorado State 9 
The sign appeared on their door the night after the game. Some girls left it, 
asking Detmer and Henderson to go out with them. Detmer and Henderson read the 
sign and thought, why not? 
They went out to eat. They played miniature golf. They took a picture. Next 
thing anybody knew, Ty and his blind date were pictured on wedding 
announcements distributed around campus. 
If there's anything he loves as much as football and hunting, it's a good 
prank. A few teammates got him on this one. 
No wonder Henderson talked Detmer into going. He knew it was a set-up all 
along. 
Oct. 20, in the mountains 
Another bye, another weekend clearly in focus. 
"Got a deer that weekend," Detmer said. 
By now, with the telephone ringing and the press hounding, the woods and 
mountains were the only place he could get any rest. His cousin, Freddie 
Buchholz, was with him, and Buchholz got a real eye opener when a local 
television station did a live remote and showed Ty building a fire and telling 
hunting tales. 
So much for Detmer's peace. 
Buchholz, meanwhile, spent the night at Ty's house. 
So much for Buchholz's peace. 
"Freddie said the phone never stopped ringing," Betty Detmer said. "He was glad 
to get out of there, he said." 
By now, things were going well off the field as well as on. It was about this 
time that Detmer got a girlfriend. 
Her name is Kim Herbert, and she is 22. Mainly, she and Detmer spend time at 
her house or in the mountains. 
"It would probably be difficult for them to make a movie," Henderson said. "On 
time, anyway." 
She gives his roommates and Eric Mortensen, a teammate, all the ammunition they 
need. Mortensen, you see, had a pretty serious girlfriend for about two years. 
"Ty always used to talk about it," Henderson said. "About how he was spending 
so much time taking her out to eat, and how much money he was spending. 
"Now it's all swung back to Ty." 
As for Detmer's family, Herbert has already passed inspection. Sonny saw her 
playing softball in July and, well . . . 
"He said she could hit hard and run well," Betty Detmer said. "Is that a 
coach's impression or what?" 
Oct. 27, in Provo 
BYU 55, New Mexico 31 
Homecoming. Pep rallies. Sharks. 
Sharks? 
Ty Detmer, Mr. Heisman Trophy candidate, took three stitches in his left hand a 
few days before the game when he punctured it dissecting a shark. 
The way Evans tells the story, one of the girls in class couldn't cut through 
the shark skin, so Detmer decided to help. 
Ring! 
When Detmer called home, Sonny answered while humming the "Jaws" theme. 
The wound wasn't serious enough for Detmer to skip the game. He passed for 464 
yards. 
Nov. 3, in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
BYU 54, Air Force 7 
You play football in the East, you see all kinds of weather. You play football 
in the West, you don't worry so much about the elements. Until now. 
"First time I played in snow," Detmer said. "It was a lot of fun. It's a lot 
better than playing in rain. The ball doesn't get wet." 
Not many could tell he had never played in snow -- he passed for 397 yards and 
three touchdowns. 
Meanwhile, Detmer's parents watched the game on satellite television. This is 
how they saw most of his games. A friend had his television hooked up to a 
satellite dish, a local cafe in Mission also had one and near the end of the 
season, the booster club had a satellite dish installed at Koy's high school. 
The only game they missed was the Hawaii game. As it would turn out, that was 
probably for the best. 
NOV. 10, in Laramie, Wyo. 
BYU 45, Wyoming 14 
The game had long since ended. Detmer had another Detmer game, passing for 484 
yards. Edwards was on his way home. Suddenly, he was struck by a thought: Ty 
Detmer was going to win the Heisman. 
Edwards had called Detmer into his office several times in the past few months 
to talk to him about the Heisman. How to handle all of the media requests. How 
to handle all of the appearance requests. How are you doing, Ty? Is it too 
overwhelming? You OK? 
He always was. And now, for the first time, Edwards allowed himself to think in 
terms of Ty winning. 
"It wasn't until then that I thought it might happen," Edwards said. "I 
remember going home and telling my wife, 'You know, I really think Ty is going 
to win the thing.' " 
Nov. 17, in Salt Lake City 
BYU 45, Utah 22 
The numbers continued to get larger. Detmer passed for 451 yards, increasing 
his career total to 10,106. He became the first junior to pass for more than 
10,000 yards in a career. By season's end, he would hold 42 NCAA records. This 
game was also noteworthy because BYU clinched the WAC title. 
The crunch on Detmer had become so strong during the season that BYU eventually 
quit setting up one-on-one telephone interviews. There was a weekly conference 
call, two if called for. Ralph Zobell, BYU sports information director, figured 
that by the end of the season, more than 100 people had interviewed Detmer just 
on the conference calls. 
"Saturdays have been fun," Detmer said. "Other than that, its been hectic. Each 
week, we got better and better and stayed in the spotlight." 
Nov. 24, in Provo 
BYU 45, Utah State 10 
Relief. The week before the Heisman ballots went in. Finally, the speculation 
was about to end. 
Disaster. Five interceptions. 
Against Utah State? 
"Didn't go as well as we wanted it to," Detmer said. 
Said Edwards: "We'd won the championship and really had a hard time coming 
back," he said. 
Dec. 1, Honolulu 
Heisman day 
Hawaii 59, BYU 28 
You don't describe the feeling of something like winning the Heisman Trophy in 
words. You do it through tears and laughs, and smiles and hugs. 
The Detmers had a feeling this would be a good day. Lori, 10 1/2 and the only 
girl playing in an organized flag football league in Mission, had a game that 
morning. After three earlier losses, her team finally won. 
Then, the Detmers got on their game clothes and drove to Kingsville for a 
playoff game. They got there early enough for a television hookup with Ty in 
Hawaii. Word came. He won. Sonny broke down crying. 
"Sonny broke down," Betty Detmer said. "He bawled. Our friends were laughing. 
He had told me, 'You're going to have to talk. This is getting to be too much 
for me.' " 
Oh, what a day. Later, Koy's team won its playoff game. 
Oh, what a week. Everyone except Koy went to New York for the Heisman ceremony. 
Betty and daughters Dee Dorman, 21, who is married, and Lori flew in Dec. 6. 
Sonny went the next day. Koy stayed behind so he wouldn't miss football 
practice during the playoffs. 
Everyone else met Ty and Kim and a few BYU representatives. 
His mother had not seen him since the first weekend in September in El Paso. 
His father hadn't seen him since early July. 
They picked up two trophies. One is at BYU. The other sits in his grandparents' 
house. 
It hasn't been an easy year for them. Ty's grandfather, Hubert Sr., has cancer, 
and the Detmers know he probably will not be with them next football season. 
Maybe some kind of award should go to his grandparents. They, after all, are 
the ones who kept Ty's scrapbooks this fall. Betty's brother in St. Louis, 
sister in Corpus Christi, and friends in Indiana, Ohio and Florida would all 
send clippings, and his grandparents' house maybe was the biggest fire hazard 
in Texas. 
There will be more clippings. This winter: Will Ty apply early for the NFL 
draft? If not, next fall: Can Ty repeat his Heisman? 
Edwards said Detmer will forgo the NFL draft and return for a senior season at 
BYU. 
"And if he said he's coming back, you can just write it down," Edwards said. 
The months have worn on Detmer. It hasn't shown in public. There have been no 
reports of him losing his temper or being rude. But those who know him well 
have noticed a subtle change. They say he seems a little quieter, a little more 
worn out. 
After the Holiday Bowl, he will return to Mission with his mother and father in 
the family van. They figure to get home on New Year's Eve, and Ty will stay 
there for a week or so. He has asked his parents not to plan anything during 
that time. He would like to rest. 
There is always just one more day, though. That will come Saturday, when BYU 
tries to avenge last year's Holiday Bowl loss to Penn State. A couple of Ty's 
cousins from Texas will meet the Detmers in San Diego. And a few nights ago, 
Betty Detmer spoke with Ty on the phone. 
"Ty," she told him. "It's going to be awful hard here in Texas if you don't 
beat A&amp;M." 
Ty Detmer has taken the attention and the publicity this year and thrown them 
50 yards downfield, and then been ready for more. And now, his mother was 
telling him how difficult it would be to live in Texas if BYU loses the Holiday 
Bowl? 
He laughed.
