THE DAMNED STAYS TRUE TO ITS SPIRIT 
The Damned may not have been the best or most innovative of the English punk 
groups, but in 1977 this messy goon squad was the first British punk outfit to 
issue a single and an album. And, most influentially, it was the first to play 
Los Angeles, serving as the catalyst for a revolutionary style of music and 
fashion whose ramifications still roar through the Southland's rock scene. 
It's fitting that the group ended the recent L.A. stop at the Hollywood 
Palladium on what is billed as its farewell tour in the same rowdy manner as 
its debut more than a decade ago at the Starwood: Drummer Rat Scabies 
demolished his drums while bassist-guitarist Captain Sensible (definitely not a 
contender for any health club endorsements) ran around nude. 
Like the title of one of its most ferocious rave-ups, the Damned, which plays 
Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre tonight, is still pretty "Neat Neat Neat." Running 
through a career retrospective at the Palladium, the quartet concentrated on 
the dark fury of its first and best album before adding a fifth player for 
later "hits," while a sold-out throng of kids took songs like "Smash It Up" to 
heart (and body) in the slam pit. 
This show also confirmed that underneath the obnoxious behavior and often 
sloppy, haphazard playing is a band of faithful believers in the liberating 
spirit of outrageous rock 'n' roll. 
Paying tribute to that spirit with crash-and-burn versions of Beatles, Stones 
and Iggy Pop classics mixed in with its own tunes, the Damned proved that it 
deserves a place alongside the musical company it kept. 
 The Damned and Celebrity Skins play at 7:30 tonight at the Celebrity Theatre, 
201 E. Broadway, Anaheim. Tickets: $18.50. Information: (714) 999-9536.
