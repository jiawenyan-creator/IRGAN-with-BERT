  [Excerpts] One of the former Soviet Union's airplanes that 
has always been a mystery to Western powers, the Sukhoi, which 
can hit a speed of Mach 2, will be shown at the International 
Aerospace Fair (Fidae 94) which will take place between 20 and 
27 March at the Los Cerrillos base. 
  A group of officials from the Russian state company 
"Rosvuruzhenie" headed by Vladimir Kolnytchenco on 9 February 
signed a contract with Air Force Colonel Rodolfo Acuna Guimpert, 
Fidae executive director, to present SU-27 and SU-30 jets at the 
fair. [passage omitted] 
  The Russian state company "Rosvuruzhenie," which is the only 
Russian company entitled to trade weapons, also is dedicated to 
strengthening ties with foreign countries. 
  It will show about 100 pieces of war equipment and Russian 
military technology at Fidae 94, of which the Tor-M1 
anti-aircraft rockets, which can down two airplanes 
simultaneously, are the most outstanding surface weapons.
