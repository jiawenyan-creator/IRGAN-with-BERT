  [Text] Farmers in the Maritime Kray have started sowing 
their early grain crops half a month later than usual. The 
reason for the disruption to the agricultural timetable was the 
acute shortage of funds during the preparations for sowing, 
which caused numerous shortcomings in equipment repair, fuel, 
and mineral fertilizers. In March the Russian Government 
promised nearly 40 billion rubles in loans to assist peasants in 
the Maritime Kray with their sowing operations. However, up to 
now only a little more than half of this sum has been received. 
  Commercial banks to which the peasants have applied for 
advances are giving loans only on collateral. However, the 
majority of farmers have no possibility of accepting this; their 
workers have not received wages for several months. 
  As a result, only 4,000 hectares of early grain crops have 
been sown in the Maritime Kray so far, which is 15-fold less 
than for the same period last year.
