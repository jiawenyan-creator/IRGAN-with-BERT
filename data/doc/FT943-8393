FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: PepsiCo shares leap on buy-back
Shares in PepsiCo, the US soft drinks and fast food company, jumped Dollars
1 1/8 to close at Dollars 32 1/4 yesterday after the company announced that
it planned to resume buying back its own stock.
Under a share repurchase programme that came into effect in July last year,
the company can buy back 39.6m, or 5 per cent, of its 792m shares in issue.
The original programme authorised the repurchase of 50m shares, of which
10.4m have already been bought back.
PepsiCo's shares have been under a cloud since June when the company
announced that a price war in the US cola market and poor performances from
its fast food operations would result in flat second-quarter profits.
The share price plummeted by 9 per cent to Dollars 31 1/2 on the news, and
has been hovering around that level since.
Mr Wayne Calloway, chairman and chief executive, said: 'With our seasonally
strengthening cash flow and the relative valuation of our shares lower than
it's been in years, buying PepsiCo stock makes good sense for us right now.'
