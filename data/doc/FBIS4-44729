Solar Energy Project"] 
  [Text] Amsterdam--By next year Amsterdam will have the 
largest public housing solar energy project in Europe. 
Commissioned by the Amsterdam Energy Company [EBA], 66 homes in 
the district of Nieuw-Sloten are to be provided with 
photovoltaic cell systems. Danish, Italian and Spanish partners 
are following the progress of this large-scale, European 
Community demonstration project with great interest. 
  The recent promise of financial support from the European 
Community and Novem (Netherlands Organization for Energy and the 
Environment) has helped the Amsterdam project a great deal 
along. "Certainly because it concerns the first, large-scale 
project in Europe in which solar energy is wholly included in 
home architecture," says project leader J. Cace, of the 
management department of the EBA. She points out the fact that 
there will be no orange roof tiles on the roofs, but only dark 
blue solar boards. The total surface of the photovoltaic cell 
systems is 2,500 square meters, and the capacity of the solar 
cells is 250 kW. The foundations for the project will be laid 
in September of this year; the completion of the solar houses is 
planned for May 1995.

  Another striking part of the project is the fact that the 
electricity which will be produced will not go directly to the 
occupants of the houses but to the public network. Via the 
medium and low voltage network the current will go back to the 
district. "This way even houses that do not themselves contain 
solar cells will profit from the clean solar energy," says Cace. 
Through the use of solar energy, the inhabitants are able to 
reduce the amount of pollution in the atmosphere by 135 tons of 
CO2, 300 kilograms of SO2, and 376 kilograms of NOx. 
  The solar cells are made by R&amp;S Renewable Energy 
Systems in 
Helmond and BP Solar in Leatherhead (United Kingdom), each of 
which is responsible for half of the cost. In addition to the 
commissioner, EBA, Ecofys is also taking part in the project. 
The project has also drawn the attention of other EC countries, 
which have similar plans. Participants are the PV Applications 
Center in Newcastle, Sermasa from Madrid, Miljokontrollen of 
Copenhagen, and the Institute Cooperatieve per Innovatione in 
Genoa. Case again: "Finally, it is an important demonstration 
project for Europe because it will, for instance, provide more 
insight into increases in scale, and the economic advantages of 
full integration of solar cells in the construction and power 
supply by district."
