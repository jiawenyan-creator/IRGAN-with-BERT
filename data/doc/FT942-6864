FT  27 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: RTZ narrows Anglo's lead in
mining league
Anglo American Corporation of South Africa is still the world's most
important mining company but RTZ Corporation of the UK, in second place, is
closing the gap between them.
This becomes clear from the latest Who Owns Who in Mining, which also shows
that Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's biggest company, and Freeport
McMoRan of the US are among the fastest-growing big mining companies.
The Raw Materials Group of Sweden, which compiled the data, admits that RTZ
can claim to be the world's largest mining company using many other
criteria.
However, RMG draws up its league table by reference to the value of
non-fuels minerals production controlled by each company. This method of
assessment naturally gives most weight to production of high-value metals
and minerals such as gold and diamonds. Not only is Anglo the world's
biggest gold producer, RMG also counts De Beers, one of the world's big
diamond producers, as an integral part of the Anglo group, not a separate
mining company, even though it is quote separately.
Similarly, RTZ's 49 per cent-owned associated in Australia, CRA, is
considered by RMG to be part of the UK group.
BHP, which in 1990 accounted for only 1.5 per cent of non-fuel minerals
production outside the former eastern bloc countries, now has 2.5 per cent,
mainly because of its huge step-up in copper production caused by its
partly-owned Escondida mine in Chile. Freeport has moved up from 17th in the
1991 league table to 7th because of progressively increased output from its
copper-gold mine in Indonesia.
Meanwhile, problems in the African copper belt, where there has been a lack
of capital for investment for many years, saw Zaire drop from 14th to 25th
position and its share of output from 1.1 to 0.7 per cent.
RMG points out that, in contrast, some of the world's most successful mining
companies are state-controlled. Who Owns Who in Mining 1994: Pounds 150 or
USDollars 310 and Roskill's Metal Databook 1994 Pounds 190 or Dollars 420
