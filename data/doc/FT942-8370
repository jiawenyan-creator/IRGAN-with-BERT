FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: KHD tumbles DM135m into the red
Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz, one of the world's leading makers of diesel
engines, said it made a DM135m (Dollars 80.8m) operating loss in 1993
following a DM26m profit the year before.
The Cologne-based group said it would make a loss in the first half of 1994
but would break even this year, forecasting turnover up 6 per cent. Sales
rose 6 per cent to DM839m in the first four months and incoming orders rose
10 per cent to DM1.10bn.
Group turnover fell 11 per cent to DM3.2bn, with a 17 per cent drop in
Germany alone because of recessionary pressures on German clients. Orders in
1993 rose overall by 12 per cent - after a 79 per cent increase in orders
for industrial plant - leaving KHD with an order book worth DM2.3bn. Group
debts rose DM280m to DM1.3bn as investment in new products continued.
Demand for engines and energy systems, which make up about 55 per cent of
turnover, is expected to pick up this year.
KHD had said it would be able to pay a dividend in 1996 but Mr Werner
Kirchgasser, chief executive, said such plans would have to be put off until
1997 and even then a dividend would not be guaranteed.
