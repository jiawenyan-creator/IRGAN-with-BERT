  [Text] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has stated that the 
harbor that Sudanese President 'Umar al-Bashir opened earlier 
this week lies south of the 22nd parallel and not in the Hala'ib 
area. 
  The foreign minister said that he is taking this opportunity 
to stress that the opening of a new harbor in fraternal Sudan is 
an opportunity for congratulating the brothers in that country. 
  He added that the meeting of the Egyptian and Sudanese 
foreign ministers has been delayed because of their prior 
commitments.
