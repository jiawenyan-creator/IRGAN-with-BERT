FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: First Chicago halves profit
Trading profits at First Chicago, the first big US bank to report
second-quarter earnings, were less than half their record level of a year
before.
The bank, however, recovered from the losses in financial markets it
suffered in the turbulent first three months of the year.
First Chicago's lower trading profit, at Dollars 36.7m - down from Dollars
91.6m a year before - is likely to be echoed by other big American
commercial banks which are expected to report their figures during the next
week.
The reversal in bond and equity markets since the US Federal Reserve first
raised interest rates in February has brought to an end a string of
record-breaking profits in the financial markets.
First Chicago's second-quarter net income remained level at Dollars 168.5m
or Dollars 1.71 a share, due in part to a number of one-off factors.
The restructuring of Brazil's foreign bank debt added Dollars 32m to pre-tax
earnings, while the accelerated sale of certain assets brought net gains of
Dollars 22m. The bank's provision for credit losses fell to Dollars 43m,
from Dollars 70m a year before.
The year-ago quarter had been boosted by Dollars 78.7m from the sale of
equity investments, compared with gains of only Dollars 3.9m this time.
For the first six months, net income of Dollars 362.5m or Dollars 3.76 a
share was up from Dollars 347.6m or Dollars 3.78 a share a year before.
The bank's return on equity for the half year, at 18.3 per cent, was down
from 22.4 per cent while in the second quarter, return on equity slipped to
16.5 per cent.
