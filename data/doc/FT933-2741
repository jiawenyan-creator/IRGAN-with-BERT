FT  17 SEP 93 / TUC warning on health laws
THE TRADES Union Congress will resist any attempts by the government to
dilute health and safety legislation, Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary,
said yesterday.
He called for trade unionists to act as 'whistle-blowers' if environmental
regulations were not observed and said it was as vital to develop 'green'
skills as any others.
Health and safety legislation is under review to see if some regulations can
be pruned. 'We are concerned that the basic application of the law is not
changed,' he said. The onus had to remain on employers to improve health,
safety and environmental conditions.
Mr Monks was speaking in Manchester at the opening of a three-day conference
on environmental issues organised by the International Confederation of Free
Trade Unions. More than 100 delegates from 30 countries attended, several of
whom will go on to the government's Partnerships for Change conference - a
follow-on from last year's Rio de Janeiro summit on the environment - next
week.
The TUC believes environmental concerns will create jobs through development
of a 'green' industry.
'It is already becoming clear that employment and incomes are being
threatened by failure to adapt to best environmental standards,' said Mr
Monks. 'If we fail to develop to these standards, Britain will lose out.'
Mr Christopher Smith, Labour environment spokesman, said the Multilateral
Trading Organisation, to be set up to administer the new General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, must have environmental issues in its remit.
This would allow it to address problems caused by moving work from countries
with tight environmental controls to those with more lax regulations.
