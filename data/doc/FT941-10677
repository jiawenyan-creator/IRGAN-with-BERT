FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Benson says Metallgesellschaft
made him the scapegoat for losses
Mr W. Arthur Benson, the MG Refining and Marketing executive who was sacked
last Friday, says Metallgesellschaft, the troubled metals and mining group,
was fully aware of his division's trading strategies and made him the
scapegoat for losses they created, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago.
Trading losses from MG's oil and gas operations are widely believed to have
generated the recent financial crisis at the German parent.
In a written statement, Mr Benson said Metallgesellschaft was fully informed
of MG Refining and Marketing's trading strategy but chose to ignore it.
'They have acted purposefully as if they sought to create losses. There is
more here than at first meets the eye,' he said. Mr Benson also said that if
the strategy had been allowed to run its course, it would have reaped
substantial profits.
Metallgesellschaft had no response to Mr Benson.
Mr Benson would not elaborate beyond his written statement, saying he was
prohibited by his contract with his former employer. He had been president
of MG Refining and Marketing.
