  [Excerpt] Prosperity Party leader Necmettin Erbakan has 
said that the respect for Ataturk rally held in Istanbul today 
violates the election bans. 
  At a news conference in Ankara, Erbakan said that permission 
was not requested for the rally 72 hours earlier, as required by 
the law, and therefore sufficient time was not given to the 
security forces to take the necessary measures. 
  Erbakan charged that the prime minister organized this rally 
for political aims. He added: 
  [Begin Erbakan recording] In order to gather a crowd, she 
invited all our students, all our workers, even all our 
prosecutors to attend the rally even though it was a working 
day. This is a violation of the law, it is a crime. On the 
other hand, the election period is on. [end recording]
