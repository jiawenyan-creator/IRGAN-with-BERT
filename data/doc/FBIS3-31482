  [Text] Sofia, February 18 (BTA) -- Speaking in question 
time in parliament today, Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov 
described the criticism to which the Ministry of Defence and he 
personally were subjected for having frustrated a Macedonian 
initiative as groundless and biased. Mr. Khristo Biserov, MP of 
the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces], had accused him of 
"spoiling initiatives for cooperation with Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]" and "acting to the 
detriment of Bulgaria's national security and national 
interests." 
  Before giving his answer, Mr. Aleksandrov explained that 
owing to the fact that specific, delicate and classified matter 
is concerned, he had addressed a letter to the chairman of 
parliament, appealing that the issue be discussed at a meeting 
of the Parliamentary Committees on Foreign Policy and National 
Security behind closed doors. "No such meeting was held, so I 
will have to answer in principle," he said. 
  He pointed out that the Ministry of Defence accepted the 
Macedonian proposal that an expert commission be set up to 
coordinate military cooperation issues. "In 1993 the experts 
met repeatedly to discuss the possibilities and prospects of our 
future military cooperation," the defence minister explained. 
  He said that a project has been developed for cooperation 
between the Defence Ministries of Bulgaria and Macedonia. It 
will be signed after Macedonia takes an official stand on its 
text and after its final approval by the Bulgarian Government.
