Julie Rocheleau-Baumann, a Canadian hurdler, has been suspended for two years 
after a second test result indicated that she used steroids, the Canadian Track 
and Field Assn. announced. 
The association said it acted after the Sport Medicine Council of Canada had 
reported that a urine sample from Rocheleau-Baumann contained banned levels of 
stanozolol, the steroid used by sprinter Ben Johnson, who was banned for two 
years after testing positive at the Seoul Olympics.
