IN BRIEF: STRAIGHT FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH 
The scratched teeth of an ancient stallion that died more than 6,000 years ago 
have provided the first "direct proof" that humans rode horses before the 
invention of the wheel, a scientist reported last week. A microscopic study of 
horse teeth buried about 4000 BC and discovered in what is now the Ukraine in 
the Soviet Union, revealed scratches from a mouth bit, indicating the horse had 
been ridden, said David Anthony of Hartwick College in Oneonta, N.Y. 
"There has been previous speculation that horseback riding occurred this early. 
This is the first direct proof," said Anthony, an assistant professor of 
anthropology who presented his findings at the International Conference on 
Archaeozoology. 
The traditional view is that horseback riding developed between 2000 and 1500 
BC in the Ukraine. While there had been some archeological evidence that riding 
may have occurred earlier, there was no direct evidence, Anthony said. 
Anthony said he found markings on the ancient horse teeth that were identical 
to scratches and damage he had found on the teeth of modern horses from metal 
bits attached to reins used to ride them.
