  [Text] President Jiang Zemin made a secret trip to 
Shenzhen around January 23, according to sources in the Special 
Economic Zone. 
  It is believed the party chief gave a generally positive 
assessment of the city in its role as a "national testing 
ground" for market reforms. 
  And premier Li Peng, who was in Zhuhai this week, will 
reportedly make an inspection tour of Shenzhen before 
officiating at the opening ceremony of the Daya Bay nuclear 
power plant on Sunday. 
  Shenzhen sources said Mr Jiang endorsed economic experiments 
in Shenzhen while asking cadres to keep down inflation and stay 
away from "unsubstantial investment plans".
