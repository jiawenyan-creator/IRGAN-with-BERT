VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MEINERS OAKS; 
DEVELOPER LOSES SUBDIVISION APPEAL 
A Santa Barbara developer who wants to build a 50-home subdivision in Meiners 
Oaks received a setback this past week when a state Court of Appeal declined to 
reconsider his lawsuit against Ventura County. 
Attorney Frederick W. Clough said developer John J. Schuck of Franciscan West 
Developments has a week to decide if he will take the case to the state Supreme 
Court. 
Schuck sued the county in 1988 after it adopted a General Plan banning new 
subdivisions that would increase traffic on California 33 through Casitas 
Springs. 
He won the suit last year on grounds that his application fell under the old 
General Plan. A state Court of Appeal overturned that ruling in August, finding 
that his application became a new project when he reduced it from 52 to 50 
homes. Schuck asked the court to reconsider its ruling, but it declined last 
week to do so. 
Meanwhile, after more than two years of review, the county Environmental Report 
Review Committee unanimously passed the project's draft environmental impact 
report to the County Planning Commission. 
As drafted, the report requires Schuck to contribute a fair share toward the 
building of a $24-million highway bypass around Casitas Springs and a 
park-and-ride lot near California 33. THIA BELL
