FT  09 OCT 92 / Launch of New FT Indices: Country Casuals 42% ahead and
plans to increase outlets
COUNTRY CASUALS, the wo-men's wear company that was floated on the main
market in June, increased its interim pre-tax profit by 42 per cent, from
Pounds 286,000 to Pounds 405,000.
Turnover for the six months to July 25 was down slightly at Pounds 14.8m
(Pounds 15m). Mr John Shannon, chairman, said sales were 6 per cent ahead
until May, but much less had been sold in the sale period. The aim had been
to sell as many garments as possible at full price.
Trading profit rose 22 per cent to Pounds 393,000 (Pounds 321,000). Gross
profit margin improved from 55 to 58 per cent.
The 1991 interim figures were helped by a property gain of Pounds 188,000
but hindered by interest costs of Pounds 223,000. In the latest figures,
Pounds 12,000 of interest was received.
With the help of the placing proceeds, net cash increased from Pounds 1.5m
at the year-end to Pounds 2.5m. About half the Pounds 11m raised was new
money and a chunk of that was used to redeem other forms of equity.
The rest went to the venture capital companies which backed the 1989
purchase of the company from Coats Viyella, and to directors (from the Laura
Ashley stable) who then bought into the company.
The company has 157 outlets, the majority being concessions within
department stores.
Mr Shannon said the plan was to open about 12 outlets a year, develop the
new Diffusion-Sport casual wear brand and acquire other brands. A purchase
could be expected within the next year.
The autumn range had gone well so far, with September sales 12 per cent up
on a good month last year.
The company would continue to tighten up on working capital. In the first
half Pounds 1.2m was freed from stock.
Earnings per share grew to 1.88p (1.38p). No interim dividend will be paid
on the ordinary shares, but Pounds 129,000 (Pounds 134,000) was paid out in
dividends on previous forms of equity, since redeemed.
The shares closed at 122p yesterday, against a flotation price of 130p. The
current market value of Pounds 21m compares with the Pounds 12.5m paid for
the business in 1989.
