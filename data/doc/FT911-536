FT  11 MAY 91 / International Company News: Duracell in reduced loss
DURACELL, the Connecticut- based battery maker taken private in 1988 via a
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts-financed leveraged buyout, yesterday announced a net
loss of Dollars 24.1m for the three months to end-March. This compared with
a Dollars 32.3m deficit in the same period a year earlier.
Operating income for the same three months was up to Dollars 22.2m from
Dollars 18.9m, but the continued interest burden pushed the company into the
red overall. Sales improved to Dollars 290.9m, against Dollars 231.1m.
Duracell is now showing a net profit of Dollars 37.2m for the past nine
months, compared with Dollars 20.5m in the same period of 1989-90.
It said it was pleased with the figures in the light of the recession.
It has seen much of its recent growth come from Europe, recently raised over
Dollars 500m of capital via an equity issue of 34.5m shares. The shares -
sold mainly in the US - were offered at Dollars 15 apiece. Yesterday, they
were unchanged at Dollars 21 3/8.
