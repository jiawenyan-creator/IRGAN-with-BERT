  [Text] Nicosia, Feb 14 (CNA)--Britain has no plans in the 
foreseeable future to close its military bases in Cyprus or 
withdraw from the U.N. peace-keeping force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). 
  This was stated by British Defence Minister Jeremy Hanley, 
replying to a question in the House of Commons about the future 
of Britain's military presence in this east Mediterranean 
island, a former British colony. 
  Minister Hanley said the United Kingdom's military presence 
comprises about 4,500 service civilian [as received] personnel 
in two sovereign base areas and a separate contribution of over 
400 troops to the United Nations Force in Cyprus. 
  "We have no plans to withdraw from either commitment in the 
foreseeable future, although we keep all our commitments under 
review," he said. 
  Britain, Greece and Turkey were the guarantor powers of 
Cyprus' independence under the 1960 treaty of establishment of 
the Cyprus Republic. 
  Under this treaty, Britain has retained two sovereign 
military bases and other facilities on the island. 
  Turkey has been occupying 37 per cent of Cyprus' territory 
since 1974, when thousands of heavily armed Turkish troops 
invaded the island's northern part, forcibly uprooting some 
200,000 Greek Cypriots from their homes.
