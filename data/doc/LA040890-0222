POLICE SEEKING WOULD-BE RAPIST LEFT BLOODIED AND BITTEN BY MAID 
Police said Saturday that they are looking for a man who tried to rape a motel 
maid but was injured as the victim fought him off. 
The maid, described as small by acquaintances, bit the man's bottom lip and 
part of his goatee off, and also left bite marks over his upper body and 
scratches across his face. 
Hospital emergency rooms throughout Southern California have been alerted, but 
so far a suspect has not appeared, police said. 
"She's fine. She wasn't hurt at all," said a fellow employee at the motel on 
Manchester Avenue on Saturday. "She acted very bravely, and we're very proud of 
her." 
The maid, however, remains upset by the Monday morning attack and is no longer 
working alone, an employee said. 
According to police, the woman, 24, was working in a room at about 11 a.m. when 
a man entered. Police described him as a Latino, 30 to 35 years old, 5 feet, 6 
inches tall and weighing about 160 pounds. 
After the assailant attacked her, "he must have thought he'd gotten in a cave 
with a tiger," one officer said. 
Police said Saturday that if found, the man will be arrested on suspicion of 
attempted rape.
