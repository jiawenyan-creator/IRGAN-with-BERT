FT  06 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
PLATINUM and SILVER rose sharply in afternoon trade following early rallies
in the New York markets on bullish chart factors. Platinum was fixed in the
afternoon at Dollars 363 a troy ounce, up Dollars 6, before peaking above
Dollars 364 an ounce, and silver closed 14 cents higher at 398.5 cents an
ounce. Dealers said there was active option writing in silver with strike
prices at 400 cents. COCOA prices climbed to nine-month highs during the
afternoon session, with key support levels breached. The March quotation's
Pounds 24 rise to Pounds 741 a tonne elicited little sign of producer
selling, dealers said. Breach of resistance at Dollars 1,000, for the New
York March position, helped to give the market an initial spur, they added.
In contrast, London robusta COFFEE futures ran into a wave of profit taking,
following the recent rise to nine-month highs. The January position closed
Dollars 22 down at Dollars 922 a tonne. At the LME COPPER led a decline in
base metal prices before finding support below Dollars 2,220 a tonne. But
dealers thought the three months price was set to test Dollars 2,200.
