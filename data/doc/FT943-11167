FT  01 AUG 94 / Observer: The sound of silence
Sergei Mavrodi, boss of the teetering MMM financial pyramid has been unusual
among Russia's nouveau riche in being discreet to the point of invisibility.
There exists no known interview with him: he is said to be of Greek descent,
and is thought to be Russia's fourth richest person. The rest is silence.
However, his approach to business communications is starting to catch on.
Those who once gave interviews freely, now ration their time - less because
they grudge wasting it when they could be making money, more for reasons of
security: concealed in a tape-recorder could be a bomb.
Konstantin Borovoi, once the motor-mouth of Russian business and one of the
first to make it big - through his Moscow Commodities Exchange - is now
rarely featured. Oleg Boicko, the man behind the Russian Credit Bank, has
never been a great talker, and Vladimir Gussinsky, reputedly Russia's
wealthiest man, prefers the phone these days.
Mavrodi also shares his fellow tycoons' belief in mixing business and
politics. When MMM began to crumble, he threatened to use his 10m
shareholders to force a referendum on the government's performance. Borovoi
started his own Economic Freedom party, Boicko bankrolls Yegor Gaidar's
Democratic Choice, and Gussinsky helps out Grigoy Yavlinsky's Yabloko party.
Finally, all live in fear, behind armies of bodyguards and high walls.
Gussinsky, for example, built his own restaurant to have somewhere safe to
eat and his convoy of guard vehicles is larger than that of President Boris
Yeltsin. Doing business in Russian takes nerve: Sergei Mavrodi merely shows
a little more than the norm.
