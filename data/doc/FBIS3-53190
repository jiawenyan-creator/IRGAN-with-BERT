  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has said that Israel 
and the Palestinians already agree that they shall receive full 
autonomy, but he insists that this will not include 
responsibility for security and foreign affairs. Reporter Jack 
Katzenell asked him if at the Taba talks Israel will be prepared 
for new concessions on the size of the Jericho enclave: 
  [Begin recording] [Peres] Well, the size of Jericho was 
decided and I don't believe this is an open question. 
  [Katzenell] For the first time today, Israeli officials 
described the Cairo document not as an agreement, but an 
understanding. 
  [Peres] I don't know who described it, and I don't know what 
is the difference between understanding and agreement. You 
cannot agree unless you understand, and you cannot understand 
unless you agree, so what is the difference? 
  [Katzenell] Does it mean that Israel will be more flexible 
on the issue of the border crossing points, or the size of the 
Jericho enclave? 
  [Peres] Israel is flexible all the time on the crossing 
points. It cannot be flexible on the security issues. On that 
Israel will remain as it was in the Cairo talks. 
  [Katzenell] This evening Dr. Nabil Sha'th said that there 
was no progress on any of the main issues, after at lunch time 
[as heard] the Israeli sources suggested that an agreement had 
been reached. Is Israel indulging in wishful thinking, or is it 
a bad communication again with the Palestinians? 
  [Peres] I think all the declarations suffer from an early 
rhetorics. Let's wait a little bit and then we shall see. 
  [Katzenell] Today a Palestinian businessman proposed setting 
up 10 cities for 50,000 Palestinians. Would Israel take a 
positive view of such a program? 
  [Peres] Any positive enterprise will be met by Israeli 
positive response. [end recording]
