FT  02 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Revival plan for high cost
Canadian gold mine
ROYAL OAK Mines, the Vancouver-based gold producer that specialises in
restoring high-cost mines to profitability, has signed an agreement to buy
the mothballed Colomac property in Canada's Northwest Territories.
The seller is Neptune Resources, which will receive 3.5m Royal Oak shares,
worth CDollars 10.2m (Pounds 5.7m), as well as a royalty over five years,
payable if the gold price achieves an annual average of more than Dollars
400 a troy ounce. The deal is expected to be finalised on March 25.
Neptune closed Colomac in mid-1991 after the mine had been in operation for
only a year. At the time, it estimated that a gold price of about Dollars
425 an ounce was required to keep the operation profitable.
Royal Oak said that it hoped to cut cash production costs to less than
Dollars 300 an ounce, partly by running Colomac in tandem with its Giant
mine in Yellowknife.
Unionised workers at the Giant mine have staged a bitter and often violent
strike for the past nine months, but Royal Oak has kept it operating with
outside workers. The company is insisting, among other things, that wages be
linked to the gold price.
Royal Oak plans a feasibility study at Colomac this summer with a view to
reopening the mine in 1994.
