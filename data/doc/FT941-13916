FT  22 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A home or a tax liability?
My parents are both over 80. They have little income: a pension and interest
from a Pounds 35,000 fixed deposit with a building society. Their only
substantial asset is a four bedroomed house in London worth about Pounds
300,000.
They have made a will in which each leaves everything to the other and
ultimately to me as their only child. Is this the most efficient method of
minimising inheritance tax?
Assuming that all assets are left to the surviving spouse, then on the death
of that person, inheritance tax of Pounds 74,000 will be payable as the
first Pounds 150,000 would be covered by the nil rate band and the balance
would be subject to tax at 40 per cent.
We assume that the building society deposit should remain in the estate of
the surviving spouse to provide income. For inheritance tax purposes, the
most efficient approach would be to own the house as tenants-in-common and
for a half share of the house to be left in trust for the children with the
surviving spouse retaining the other half. This would utilise the nil rate
band on the first death, thereby saving Pounds 60,000 of inheritance tax and
reducing the tax charge on the second death to Pounds 14,000.
While this would be tax-efficient, the surviving spouse may not feel secure.
The children could, in theory, force a sale of the home. A trust can be used
to improve the position but there can be no greater financial security than
owning the property in your own right. This reply was provided by Barry
