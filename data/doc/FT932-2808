FT  17 JUN 93 / Sotheby's offer discreet service to Lloyd's Names
SOTHEBY'S, the London auction house, is offering a discreet tailor-made
service to Lloyd's Names who want to sell the family silver or other
heirlooms, following the spate of recent demands for cash.
Mr Lesley Weller, managing director of the auctioneers' salesroom in
Billingshurst, West Sussex, said business had been going well in recent
weeks. 'The latest calls have started to affect people. We've been handling
quite a lot of property.'
Names had been selling everything from garden statues to pictures, he added.
Nationally, Sotheby's said it had received 'thousands' of inquiries in
recent months from Names, with most seeking to raise between Pounds 50,000
and Pounds 100,000.
The flood of new pieces had not, as yet, triggered a significant fall in
prices for silver and jewellery, the auction house said, although prices in
the furniture market have dipped in the past year.
The auction house offers Names a 40 per cent discount on commission, loans
of up to 35 per cent on the value of objects sent for sale, and free
surveys. It also promises 'total anonymity'.
Mr Norbet Mallet, a Sussex-based Name who faces losses of Pounds 1m, said
ruefully that that it is a 'buyer's market'.
He has had to sell most of his family jewellery in the past two years, at
prices he believes are 'some 30 per cent lower' than 1980s' prices.
