  [Excerpt] At a news conference held in Bangkok in Thailand 
today, Czech President Vaclav Havel supported the stance of 
NATO, which threatens to carry out air strikes against Bosnian 
Serbs units unless they pull out their heavy artillery weapons 
from the vicinity of Sarajevo before 21 February. 
  At the same time, he expressed a hope that NATO was serious 
about this threat and that those whom the threat concerns are 
aware of it. President Havel said that his talks with Thai 
representatives were successful. [passage omitted]
