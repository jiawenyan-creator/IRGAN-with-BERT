FT  28 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome against the trend
DRUGS GROUP Wellcome moved against the market trend after reports that a
broker had turned cautious on the stock.
The shares, which moved sharply ahead throughout last week and the early
part of this week after US investors turned buyers of the drug sector, fell
10 to 733p in early trading yesterday on suggestions that leading agency
broker James Capel had adopted a more cautious stance. The broker was also
believed to have trimmed its forecast for the current year by Pounds 5m to
Pounds 650m.
Bargain hunting and strength elsewhere in the stock market helped Wellcome
reduce earlier losses and the shares finished a penny lighter at 742p, in
trading of 1.5m.
Several analysts appeared likely to remain cautious on the stock in the near
future. They cited stiffer competition for the group from rival
SmithKline-Beecham, whose new Herpes drug Famcyclovir, to be launched early
next year, is likely to be a strong competitor for Wellcome's Zoviarx, which
currently provides the group with around 36 per cent of sales and about 50
per cent of profits. SmithKline Beecham 'A' closed 12 up at 461p.
