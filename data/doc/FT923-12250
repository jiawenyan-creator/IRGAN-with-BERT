FT  20 JUL 92 / Urban reform planned
THE DEPARTMENT of the Environment will launch a consultation paper this week
outlining sweeping powers for the proposed Urban Regeneration Agency.
The aim of the new body will be to provide better housing, employment and
training in urban areas, as well as improving the environment. It is
expected to co-ordinate many aspects of urban development policy, including
city grants, housing corporation grants, derelict-land grants, city action
teams and urban development corporations.
The agency may also take over English Estates, an arm of the Department of
Trade and Industry that provides factory space for inward investors. It will
not, however, replace the DoE's City Challenge scheme, under which local
authorities bid for government funds for specific projects.
Plans to create the agency were announced by Mr Michael Heseltine, then
environment secretary, before the general election. Mr Peter Walker, the
former environment secretary and Welsh secretary, has been appointed to head
it.
The consultation paper will be sent to local authorities, heads of industry,
housing authorities and training bodies for comment. It is expected to
include a significant house-building programme, with the agency reclaiming
derelict land and developing it in partnership with business and local
government. It is also expected to recommend that the agency should be able
to make compulsory purchase orders and to override local planning laws.
However, the agency's total budget will not be decided before the coming
round of public-spending negotiations.
Proposals for the agency will be included in the government's Housing, Land
and Urban Development Bill, due to go before parliament in November.
If the bill is passed, the agency could be in operation by late next year.
