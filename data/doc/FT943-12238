FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional costs hit Merrydown
Stock write downs and reorganisation costs pushed Merrydown, the cider and
drinks group, into a pre-tax loss for the year to the end of March, despite
a 33 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 25.6m.
The dividend is cut from 7p to 2.5p, with a proposed final of 1.5p, and the
shares closed 2p lower at 130p yesterday.
Mr Richard Purdey, chairman, said the year had been 'one of the most
difficult in the company's 48-year history', with Christmas sales of cider
'particularly disappointing'.
Exceptional costs of Pounds 2.99m wiped out a small operating profit of
Pounds 894,000 and turned last year's Pounds 1.71m profit into a loss of
Pounds 2.79m.
However, Mr Purdey said the reorganisation would mean savings of Pounds 1.5m
in the current year. 'The group is now wholly focused on drinks,' he said.
The decision had been made to sell Martlet Natural Foods, and an agreement
with Tooheys, the Sydney-based brewing subsidiary of Lion Nathan, will mean
the launch of Merrydown Premium cider in Australia.
Earnings per share before exceptional items and discontinued activities were
2.07p (10.7p), but after exceptionals there were losses per share of 22.76p
(13.03p earnings).
