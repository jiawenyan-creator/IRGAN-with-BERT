  [Text] Qumbu April 11 SAPA -- The Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] will deliver more than 500,000 voter cards to 
Umtata on Wednesday [13 April], Transkei military ruler Maj-Gen 
Bantu Holomisa told supporters at Qumbu on Monday. The African 
National Congress candidate said the IEC had agreed to increase 
the number of cards from 200,000 after a meeting with the ANC. 
  Gen Holomisa again warned Transkeians not to accept food 
from 
the National Party because maize meal and sausages had been 
laced with a chemical which would prevent imbibers from voting. 
He promised residents his government would investigate claims 
that homeland police and soldiers, ANC and South African 
Communist Party members were linked to crime in Qumbu.
