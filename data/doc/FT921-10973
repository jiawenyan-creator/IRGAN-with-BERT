FT  04 FEB 92 / Imelda claims WWII treasure was source of husband's fortune
Mrs Imelda Marcos, attempting to explain the source of the family fortune,
said yesterday her late husband, Ferdinand, had found a treasure trove of
gold bars during the second world war, Reuter reports from Manila.
She told a news conference her husband, who ruled for two decades until
ousted in 1986, found the so-called Yamashita treasure when he was a
guerrilla fighting Japanese forces and distributed some of the gold to his
men.
The government says the Marcoses looted up to Dollars 5bn from the country.
It has filed 54 civil and criminal suits against Imelda Marcos since she
returned from exile last November.
Solicitor-General Francisco Chavez dismissed the claims by Mrs Marcos, a
candidate for president in the May elections.
