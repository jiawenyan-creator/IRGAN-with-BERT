FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Ash &amp; Lacy declines to Pounds 3.7m
PROFITS OF Ash and Lacy, the West Midlands-based galvanising and metal
products group, fell 22 per cent to Pounds 3.73m pre-tax for the year to
January 1.
Turnover was little changed at Pounds 53.9m (Pounds 54.5m). Earnings per
share fell to 9.76p (13.12p). A second interim dividend of 3.9p, payable in
lieu of a final, is declared, making an unchanged 6.4p total.
The directors said galvanising continued to reflect poor market conditions.
Volumes were maintained in the UK but fell in France, with overall
divisional profits down on last year. Profits were broadly unchanged in the
non-ferrous distribution side, and fell in the manufacturing activities.
Group properties were revalued, resulting in a Pounds 3.4m write-down.
