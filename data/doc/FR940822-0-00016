SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 1616(a) of the Social Security Act (the Act) authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the 
Secretary) to enter into agreements with the States under 
which the Secretary administers the States' supplementary 
payments. State supplementary payments are cash benefits 
paid on a regular basis to individuals who are receiving 
Federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits, or who, 
but for their income, would be eligible to receive SSI 
benefits. When the Social Security Administration, acting as 
the Secretary's delegate, has entered into an agreement with 
a State for the Federal administration of these supplementary 
payments, the State transfers the funds necessary to make 
these payments to us and we make these payments to the 
recipients. States that make State supplementary payments 
but that have not elected Federal administration make the 
payments themselves directly to recipients. If a State 
elects Federal administration, we charge the State an 
administration fee as of October 1, 1993, for each 
supplementary payment we make on behalf of the State, 
pursuant to section 13731 of the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 10366). A federally 
administered State supplementary payment is included in the 
same payment with the Federal SSI benefit where both a State 
supplementary payment and a Federal SSI benefit are payable. 
The payment level amounts of State supplementary payments are 
determined by the States. From time to time, States may 
change the payment level amounts, either by increasing them, 
or by reducing them. 



Our existing regulations provide in 416.1402(b) that 
reduction, suspension, or termination of SSI benefits is an 
initial determination. The regulations at 416.2005(d) 
provide that, generally, the regulations in effect for the 
SSI program are applicable in the Federal administration of 
State supplementary payments. Therefore, any reduction, 
suspension, or termination of federally administered State 
supplementary payments is also an initial determination. 
Section 416.1404 provides that we will mail to the affected 
recipient a written notice of our initial determination, 
including the right to a reconsideration before the 
determination takes effect. Further, 416.1413b provides 
that a recipient has 60 days within which to appeal our 
determination that we plan to reduce, suspend, or terminate 
his or her benefits. 

In the current process under our regulations, we 
consider the reduction, suspension or termination of State 
supplementary payments to be an initial determination, mail 
appropriate written notice of our initial determination and 
provide appeal rights to all affected recipients. We apply 
this process even with respect to mass changes in State 
supplementary payment level amounts, 

i.e.,

 a State-initiated 
change in the level(s) of federally administered State 
supplementary payments payable to all recipients of State 
supplementary payments or to categories of such recipients, 
due, for example, to State legislative or executive action. 
In many such cases in which a recipient appeals the 
reduction, suspension, or termination of his or her State 
supplementary payments due to the State-initiated mass 
change, he or she wishes only to dispute the propriety, 
fairness, or legality of that mass change, for example, and 
not to dispute the application of that mass change to the 
facts of his or her case, 

i.e.,

 not to dispute the revised 
benefit computation.
