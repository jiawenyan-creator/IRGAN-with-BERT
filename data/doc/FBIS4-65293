  [Text] Sweden's foreign minister, Margaretha af Ugglas, 
says Sweden is against lifting UN weapons sanctions that have 
been in force against Bosnian Muslims. The foreign minister was 
reacting to the U.S. Senate's Thursday [12 May] vote for lifting 
the sanctions. She says she believes that this would lead to an 
escalation of the war there and that could endanger civilians 
and the peace-keeping troops, including the Nordic battalions. 
The U.S. decision cannot be made law until its other 
legislative arm, the House of Representatives, also passes the 
controversial bill.
