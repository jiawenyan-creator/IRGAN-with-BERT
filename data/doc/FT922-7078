BRITAIN yesterday maintained its opposition to legally binding European
Community rates of value added tax, delaying a decision on the issue until
next month at the earliest.
EC ministers were unable to agree on a series of directives enshrining last

rate of 15 per cent, and has specific difficulties in agreeing directives on
harmonised alcohol and tobacco duties.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor - probably the only person who can sanction
a change in the British stance - left Brussels before yesterday's debate on
indirect tax.
Ministers also postponed a decision on the capital adequacy directive, which
would harmonise prudential standards for banks and investment firms. The
Portuguese presidency hopes for agreement at next month's meeting of
ministers.
The Advertising Association, which represents 26 leading advertising trade
bodies, today steps up its lobbying of the government, MPs and members of
the European parliament for further and wider deregulation within the EC.
