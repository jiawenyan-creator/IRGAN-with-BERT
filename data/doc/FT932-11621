FT  01 MAY 93 / Property: For Pounds 50,000, there's a world of choice
A THREE-bedroom, semi-detached house in the Midlands region of England will,
typically, cost Pounds 50,000, according to the country's largest building
society, the Halifax. But what will it buy in other parts of the world?
In the Irish republic, you could get a two-bedroom house or flat in a suburb
of Dublin or Cork. In Switzerland, though, you could probably find only a
re-sale studio at that price; even then, it would take some effort. One such
 -at just over Pounds 50,000 and offered by David de Lara &amp; Partners (tel:
081-749 2188) - is a second-floor studio with balcony in a chalet at Les
Crosets in Portes du Soliel, the Franco-Swiss ski area.
In France itself, Pounds 50,000 will buy you a manor house in Picardy with
three to five bedrooms and three acres; the sum includes the purchase fees.
Agent Barbers (071-381-0112) says it does need some repair work, but the
price has been cut from Pounds 85,000.
This agency produces a useful after-sale leaflet with advice on such things
as paying bills at a distance, letting, and getting restoration work done.
If, for instance, you use an unregistered builder, you will not get a VAT
receipt and will be unable to offset the work against capital gains tax.
In France's Charente Maritime area, Pounds 50,000 will acquire a
three-bedroom cottage with 24 acres of marshland running down to the Gironde
estuary - a place for the fishing and shooting enthusiast. The cottage does
need some interior updating but is only 35 miles from Bordeaux and its
international airport.
It is offered by the French Property Shop (0892-852-449) which, at the same
price, also suggests a house in a tourist village close to the river
Dordogne for anyone seeking a home with income. This has four suites of
bedrooms with shower rooms and is used for bed and breakfast. The English
owners put it on the market originally at Pounds 72,300.
Then there is leaseback. You can buy a property priced at, say, Pounds
80,000-plus in a Pierre &amp; Vacances resort in France, lease it back to the
company for 11 years - and pay only around Pounds 50,000. You can use it
yourself for six weeks a year and have no management or maintenance charges.
Pierre &amp; Vacances (071-924-6866) has several resorts where this sort of deal
is available, including two on the Atlantic coast.
Possibilities elsewhere include:
Andorra. Wedged between France and Spain in the Pyrenees, it can be tedious
to reach by road from either country, but the living costs are low and there
is good skiing. There, Pounds 50,000 will buy a two-bedroom flat in a town
although the price edges up in the valleys, says agent GAK Williamson &amp;
Associates (0962-734-999). Slightly larger than the Isle of Wight, the
principality has a population of about 55,000, around 4,000 British.
Spain. There are re-sale properties at whatever price you want. For Pounds
50,000 there is a three-bedroom furnished apartment near Fuengirola; a
two-bedroom apartment in the La Manga club near Cartegena; a three-bedroom
detached villa near Torrevieja; a two-bedroom town house near Rosas, with
boat mooring included; and many more (through Shield Kall Wright, tel.
0708-450-784). Fewer new properties are available at this price, although
studios are being marketed in the harbour section of Sotogrande on the Costa
del Sol (071-924-6866).
For Pounds 50,000, buyers should be able to find something new at the
Kennedy-Wilson auction of Wimpey properties in Spain and Gibraltar at
Marbella on May 9 (details: 071-497-9707). The 77 units being offered range
from one-bedroom apartments to three-bedroom town houses at Estepona, Spain,
with reserve prices from Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 70,000 (including several
at Pounds 50,000).
Of the 19 apartments offered in Gibraltar, four have a Pounds 50,000
reserve. Bidders must register before auction day.
Portugal. Another way to spend around Pounds 50,000 on an overseas property
would be to buy a quarter share. These are available from Bovis Abroad at
its Sao Lourenco development on the Algarve. The company insists it is not
timeshare because you get freehold title.
A quarter share of a two-bedroom furnished flat can be bought for Pounds
49,000, and there is an annual maintenance charge of Pounds 1,000. Your
three months' use is divided into sections through the year, and the pattern
rotates over four years. Quarter-share apartments are mixed among those in
single ownership on the estate, which offers tennis and swimming. Owners get
a 25 per cent discount on the golf course. Information: 0800-252-235.
Italy. Many of the rural possibilities there would double in cost once
essential renovation was taken into account. But Brian A French &amp; Associates
(071-284-0114) suggests a six-room farmhouse at Montisi, Tuscany, with
cellars, stables and 20 acres. Priced originally at Pounds 75,000, the
owners (the family of the late actor Robert Morley) will take Pounds 50,000;
the reduction should help to offset any later bills.
Turkey. A London agent (071-352-2931) who himself has a property in the far
south-west Bodrum region says Pounds 50,000 would finance a very comfortable
villa there on a sizeable plot. One possibility is a freehold site close to
the water at Turbuku, 18 miles from Bodrum, and big enough for a detached
house with three or four bedrooms and two bathrooms.
The agent suggests that the work could be carried out by a local architect
and builder, and adds that other sites are available in nearby villages. The
nearest international airports for the area are at Izmir or Dalaman.
Greece. A British builder (0423-865-892) is constructing five villas with
three to four bedrooms, priced from Pounds 50,000. The development is in the
Mani area ('the real Greece, rather than the holiday hot-spots') of the
Peleponnese, the most southerly part of the mainland. It is about a mile
back from the coast but the houses have sea views. The nearest airport is
Kalamata.
Holland. In Rotterdam, you could buy a block of three (tenanted) flats for a
little under Pounds 50,000, purchase costs included. They will return an
income of just over Pounds 4,000 a year net of running costs and expenses,
according to London solicitor Osbornes (071-485-8811) which is offering
them.
Czechoslovakia. Arlette Adler, of Villas Abroad (081-891-5444), is partly
Czech and her agency has property available in Prague. For Pounds 50,000 you
could buy a one-bedroom flat in the city centre or a two-bedroom apartment
off-centre.
There is a shortage of hotel accommodation in Prague and charges are high.
Thus a business person who visits the Czech capital often might find it
worth having such a pied-a-terre available, particularly as Adler says it
could be let 'extremely profitab1y' when not required.
US. In south-west Florida, east of commercially-orientated Fort Myers, is
Lehigh Acres, a residential community with three golf courses. Agent Tom
Cowell in Bangor, Wales (0248-370-601), is offering three-bedroom,
two-bathroom homes with two-car garages on quarter-acre plots for just under
Pounds 50,000, including the land.
Some 37 miles south, on the fringe of leisure-orientated Naples, is the
3,000-acre Lely Resort where a third golf course will be completed next
year. A hotel, tennis ranch, country club and pools are being built, along
with houses and flats.
What would Pounds 50,000 buy there? If you are lucky, says UK agent Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley (071-824-8171), you might just get a quarter-acre plot
overlooking a fairway. The house would be what you cared to spend.
