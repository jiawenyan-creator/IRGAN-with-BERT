FT  26 SEP 94 / International Company News: Minerals side lifts BHP in first
quarter
Broken Hill Proprietary, the large Australian resources group, yesterday
announced a first-quarter profit after tax of ADollars 372.5m (USDollars
275m), compared with ADollars 316.1m in the same period last year. The
result was lifted by a near-50 per cent improvement in profits from its
minerals division.
Total revenues during the period increased by 7.9 per cent, to ADollars
4.48bn, while basic earnings per share rose by 12.7 per cent to 26.7 cents.
Although the figures were in the middle of the range of original market
forecasts, some analysts had upgraded their estimates after BHP released a
strong August production report earlier in the week.
After-tax profits on the minerals side rose to ADollars 227.4m from ADollars
152m. BHP said the improvement reflected the consolidation of the Ok Tedi
mine in Papua New Guinea, where it recently raised its stake by buying out
the Amoco interest, together with higher shipments from the Escondida mine
and higher copper prices. Partly offsetting these benefits were lower US
dollar prices for coal, iron ore and manganese.
Profits from the steel division were little changed at ADollars 139.5m. BHP
said that Australian operations improved their performance but there was a
lower result from BHP New Zealand Steel, due to renovation work.
Petroleum profits rose by ADollars 9.7m to ADollars 143.3, due to better
results for the Hawaiian operations and higher sales volumes, which offset
lower realised oil prices and unfavourable exchange rate movements. Profits
from the service companies fell to ADollars 10.9m from ADollars 18.7m.
