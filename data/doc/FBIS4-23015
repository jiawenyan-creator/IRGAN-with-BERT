  [Abstract] The shortcomings of long-range forecasting of 
biotechnology productions, particularly the formulation of 
specific trends of systemic development concepts, and the 
negative impact of the ``corrective response'' management 
practices prompted the development of a new approach based on a 
systemic representation of the prototype plant as an organically 
integral complex containing the hypothetical image of the 
biopreparation (BP) and the methods of its development and 
production. To this end, existing predicted entity 
classification approaches and forecasting methods are analyzed. 
A block diagram of step-by-step morphological analysis and a 
block diagram of the initial morphological culturing version 
matrix are cited, and the outcome of the culturing method 
assessment by the expediency criterion is summarized. The above 
step-by-step prediction procedure is suggested for use on the 
basis of morphological analysis and a group of expert methods; 
the procedure is tested in forming the predictive image of new 
biotechnology plants for producing viral preparations on the 
basis of animal cell cultures. The optimum version selection and 
rejection of dead-end versions are performed in three 
iterations. In particular, perfusion culturing in a membrane 
biological reactor or a reactors with packed macrocarrier 
spheres are suggested. Figures 2; tables 1; references 20: 14
