  [Excerpts] Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero yesterday 
reported that by mid-May all public utility rates will be 
converted into URV's [Real Value Units] and that the conversion 
of insurance policies, mutual funds, and farming loans will be 
defined by the end of May. 
  The government promises to announce the monetary and 
exchange 
policy rules on 1 June. As of 1 July, there will be 15 days to 
change real cruzeiros for reals at banks. Bank checking and 
savings accounts, financial applications like commodities and 
mutual investment funds will be converted to URV's automatically 
based on the 1 July URV rate. [passage omitted] 
  Throughout those 15 days banks will be authorized to remain 
open one more hour per day just to exchange real cruzeiro notes 
for reals. The Central Bank will release 1.9 billion real notes 
and nearly 800 million real coins.
