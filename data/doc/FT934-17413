FT  01 OCT 93 / Goode Committee: The main recommendations
There should be a new Occupational Pensions Schemes Act to codify
recommended reforms
A Pensions Regulator should be appointed
The roles of the Pensions Ombudsman and the Occupational Pensions Advisory
Service should be strengthened
A Pensions Compensation Scheme should be set up to cover fraud, theft or
misappropriation. This should be financed by a levy on all occupational
schemes
Scheme members should be entitled to appoint at least a third of all
trustees, with a minimum of two per scheme. Employers would not be able be
removed these members
There should be no restrictions on an employer's ability to take a
contributions holiday, provided the scheme has met minimum solvency
standards
Employers wishing to extract cash from their schemes should first obtain
permission from the Pensions Regulator, even if their trust rules
specifically permit them to do so. The Regulator should only give permission
under certain circumstances
Schemes should meet minimum solvency standards. They should not have assets
equal to less than 90 per cent of what would be needed to meet liabilities.
If they did, the employer should make up the shortfall within three months
and if this is not done, the Regulator should take remedial action
Employers should be free to amend their schemes to reduce or restrict
benefits for future service. They should also be free to wind up their
schemes entirely. However, they should not be able to restrict benefits
earned in the period of employment prior to changes in the scheme
