the baseline determination, the following information on 
1990 batches of gasoline, or shipments if not batch blended, 
are required by grade shall be provided: 
(i) First and last sampling dates;

blended; 
(C) Total volume of all batches or shipments; 
(D) Number of batches or shipments sampled; 
(E) Total volume of all batches or shipments sampled; 
(F) Baseline fuel parameter value, per 80.91; and

used in the refinery's gasoline are required, by blendstock 
type shall be provided: 
(i) First and last sampling dates; 
(ii) The following shall be indicated separately on a 
summer and winter basis, by month: 
(A) Number of post-1990 months sampled; 
(B) Each type of blendstock used in 1990 gasoline and 
total number of blendstocks. Include all blendstocks 
produced, purchased or otherwise received which were blended 
to produce gasoline within the facility. Identify all 
blendstocks not produced in the facility but used in the 
facility's 1990 gasoline; 
(C) Total volume of each blendstock used in gasoline 
in 1990; 
(D) Identification of post-1990 blendstock streams as 
batch or continuous; 
(E) Number of post-1990 blendstock samples from 
continuous blendstock streams;

processes, including volume of each batch sampled; and 
(G) Baseline fuel parameter value, per 80.91; and
(iii) Support documentation showing that the criteria of 
80.91 for using Method 3-type blendstock data are met. 
(6) 

Method 3, post-1990 gasoline data. 

The following 
information on post-1990 batches of gasoline, or shipments 
if not batch blended, are required by grade: 
(i) First and last sampling dates; 
(ii) The following shall be indicated separately for 
summer and winter production, by month: 
(A) Number of post-1990 months sampled; 
(B) Number of post-1990 batches, or shipments if not 
batch blended;
