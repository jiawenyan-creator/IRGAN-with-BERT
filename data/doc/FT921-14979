FT  13 JAN 92 / How wage inequality affects working women's pay
THE CROSS-COUNTRY variation in the average wages of women, relative to those
of men, has grown over the past two decades. By the late 1980s, the average
hourly wages of women ranged from 80-90 per cent of men's in Scandinavia and
Australia, to 70-80 per cent in continental Europe and 65-70 per cent in the
US and UK. This variation is often thought to prove that there remain
national differences in the obstacles that women face in the labour force,
compared to those facing men. But this simple comparison is misleading.
There is little cross-country variation in the gender wage gap for single
women with no dependents. The bulk of each country's overall gender gap, as
well as the variation across countries, is explained by the lower wages of
married women with children, relative to married men's (as the left-hand
chart shows). It is not surprising that the gender-gaps are larger for
married women with children than for single women. Most married women take
time off work to bring up children. As a result, the average married woman
has less work experience than the average married man. Moreover, the fact
that married women may take time off work in the future may make it less
attractive either for them or their employers to invest in training.
Prohibitively expensive child-care may also force women to return to
part-time and so lower-paid employment.
What is surprising is that American married women appear to fare so poorly
compared to women in other countries. The US has a commitment to equal pay
and equal employment opportunity legislation that predates other countries
by at least a decade. A relatively high percentage of the female US
population is in employment: 66 per cent compared to 60 per cent in
Australia and 59 per cent in Britain. US women are less likely to be
employed in typically 'female' occupations or industries. Moreover, a lower
percentage of employed women in the US work part-time: 24 per cent compared
to 37 per cent in Australia, 45 per cent in Britain and 46 per cent in
Sweden.
According to a recent study by Ms Francine Blau and Mr Lawrence Kahn at the
University of Illinois, the main reason for the relatively large US gender
gap is the high level of US wage inequality.
The authors identify two separate causes of the variation in the size of the
gender gap across countries: a gender effect, and a wage inequality effect.
The gender effect measures how differences in skills and experience, and
other obstacles to female employment, reduce the relative position of
average married women's earnings within the male wage distribution. The wage
inequality effect measures the extent to which the dispersion of the male
earnings distribution reduces average married women's earnings relative to
average male earnings.
For each country, the position of the average married woman's hourly
earnings in the male wage distribution - the percentage of men that earn
more than the average married woman - is shown on the right-hand chart. The
position of the average married woman in the US male wage distribution is
the same as in Sweden and higher than in every other country in the sample.
In the US and Sweden, 83 per cent of married men earn more than the average
married woman, compared with 88 per cent in the UK and 93 per cent in
Germany.
It is the wage inequality effect, therefore, not the gender effect, that
explains why US married women earn less, as a proportion of average male
earnings, than Swedish women. The average married woman in both countries
earns more than the bottom 17 per cent of men. But the bottom 17 per cent of
US men earn a smaller proportion of the average male wage than the bottom 17
per cent of Swedish men. If Sweden, Britain and Germany all had
American-style wage inequality, the difference in the gender gaps between
the US and Sweden would disappear. But married women in the UK and Germany
would still fare relatively badly. So reducing the degree of wage inequality
is one important way to raise women's wages relative to those of men.

INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT
Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all data
for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100. Quarterly
and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production show the
percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and
are positive unless otherwise stated. The unemployment rate is shown as a
percentage of the total labour force. Figures for the composite leading
indicator are end-period values.
