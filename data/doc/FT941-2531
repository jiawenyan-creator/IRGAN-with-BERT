FT  19 MAR 94 / HK urged to act over property row
Hong Kong's government was yesterday urged to bring in drastic measures or
face social unrest, Louise Lucas writes from Hong Kong.
Mr Martin Lee, leader of the minority United Democrats Party, told a finance
committee meeting of the Legislative Council (LegCo) that people were
growing increasingly disgruntled at being unable to buy a flat in the boom
market. 'It could end up in public disturbances,' he said, proposing the
introduction of a property gains tax.
Mr Tony Eason, secretary for the planning, environment and land department,
said the answer was to speed up the supply of land. He was echoed by
property agents, who say China and Britain must thrash out agreement to
extend the supply of land. This is limited to 50 hectares a year under the
1984 Sino-British agreement.
Meanwhile Mr Lu Ping, director of China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs
Office, has warned Chinese companies operating in the colony not to dabble
in property speculation.
'There are some companies who think if they lose money they won't have to
foot the bill themselves. This means they push the property prices up very
high indeed.'
Residential property prices last year rose up to 38 per cent in some luxury
developments, according to Brooke Hillier Parker, surveyors and
international property consultants. Major developments in other parts of the
colony saw prices rise by around 20 per cent.
