  [Text] Budapest, 7 April (MTI) -- Following the speech of 
Hungarian President Arpad Goncz, Prime Minister Peter Boross 
took the floor in Hungarian Parliament on Thursday [7 April]. 
  On behalf of the government, he made a brief farewell 
speech, 
and stressed that, although it is debated today, the past four 
years will go down in history as an epoch-making era. 
  "These four years characterize the change in era, the change 
in approach, in other words, the change in political system. 
  "Although law-making work will cease for now, the country 
must be governed. The government considers it its fundamental 
task to create the conditions needed for an honest election and 
the creation of a parliament that accords to the will of the 
public. 
  "The government also considers it its obligation to give an 
account of its work over the past four years to the nation, for 
the first time in decades," the Prime Minister said.
