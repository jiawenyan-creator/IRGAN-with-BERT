FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Campaigning Newbury Tory candidate
Tory candidate Julian Davidson and his party chairman Sir Norman Fowler
taking a break during campaigning in Newbury yesterday.
Mr David Rendel, the Liberal Democrat candidate, appears to have gained
support in some traditionally staunch Tory areas. Both the Conservatives and
the Liberal Democrats are predicting a close result in today's by-election.
Labour meanwhile is confining itself to expressing an expectation that the
Tories will lose, insisting that such an outcome would not herald the end of
the two-party system
