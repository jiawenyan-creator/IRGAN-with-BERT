SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SOUTH PASADENA; 
CITY JOINS IMAGE PROJECT 
The city has joined an effort to improve the San Gabriel Valley's image. 
The City Council last week approved participation in the San Gabriel Valley 
Image Project, a joint public and private effort sponsored by the Synthesis 
Group, an Anaheim Hills consulting firm. 
"There's a strong feeling that the San Gabriel Valley is quite lackluster and 
needs to be re-energized," Mayor Evelyn Fierro said. "It's basically been 
neglected by statewide leaders for many, many years." 
South Pasadena's cost of participation is expected to be about $5,000.
