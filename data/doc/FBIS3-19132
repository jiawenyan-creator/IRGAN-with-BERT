<F P=106> [Report by W. Huebner: "Diestel President of Committee </F>
East"] 
  [Excerpt] Peter-Michael Diestel, deputy for the Christian 
Democratic Union in the Brandenburg Landtag, was elected 
president of the East German Committee of Associations. 
According to a declaration, the committee sees itself as an 
east German chamber that wants to participate in the lawmaking 
process and thus represent the interests of the east German 
population. 
  Wolfgang Richter, the first vice president of the committee, 
said that, since the annexation of the GDR to the FRG, one 
partner to the unification treaty ceased to exist, the committee 
is taking up the idea of a third chamber. It should mainly be 
concerned with harmonizing living conditions in east and west 
and guaranteeing the basic supply of work, living space, health 
care, and pensions. For this purpose, the committee, which 
includes more than 40 associations with 1.5 million members, 
wants to turn to the Bundestag to be included in hearings and 
debates on draft laws. An east German federal congress is due 
to be held on 28 May 1994 intended to discuss social-policy 
questions and election criteria for the parties. [passage
