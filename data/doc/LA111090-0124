METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOY, 15, KILLED BY POLICE AFTER TRAFFIC 
CHASE 
A 15-year-old Van Nuys boy was shot and killed by police when he allegedly 
refused to drop a gun after leading plainclothes officers on a chase after a 
traffic accident, authorities said Friday. 
The youth, identified as Gregory Goins, died at the scene of the shooting 
Thursday night. 
The incident began after two plainclothes officers arrived moments after three 
cars collided Thursday evening on Century Boulevard near Doty Avenue in 
Inglewood and saw two of the badly damaged cars being driven away, Sgt. John 
Bell said. The officers gave chase until both cars pulled to the curb. 
Goins, a passenger, got out and began walking toward the second car, Bell said. 
When the officers saw the driver pass a gun to Goins, Bell said, they 
identified themselves and told the suspect to drop the gun. After the youth 
allegedly "put his hand to his waistband," one of the officers fired.
