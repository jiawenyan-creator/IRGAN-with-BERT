FT  05 DEC 92 / International Company News: Banque Worms chairman quits
MR Jean-Michel Bloch-Laine yesterday resigned as chairman of Banque Worms,
the Paris-based bank, only three days after Union des Assurances de Paris
(UAP), its parent company, announced an emergency FFr1.4bn (Dollars 258m)
recapitalisation plan triggered by the bank's property losses.
The news of Mr Bloch-Laine's departure comes at a critical time for Banque
Worms, which is struggling to recover from heavy losses on property
interests. The timing is equally sensitive for UAP, France's largest
insurance company, embroiled in a bitter battle against the Suez industrial
group over plans to expand into Germany.
Banque Worms, like other French financial institutions, has been badly
affected by the economic slowdown on the value of its property portfolio,
particularly in the Paris area.
The bank lost FFr350m in the first half of 1992 when its poor performance
was one of the main reasons for the fall in UAP's interim profits from
FFr2.34bn in the first six months of 1991 to FFr948m in the same period this
year.
However, Banque Worms' second-half losses are expected to be even higher. Mr
Michael Huttner, European insurance analyst at Banque Nationale de Paris,
forecast overall losses of about FFr1bn for Banque Worms in 1992 with a fall
in full-year net profits for UAP to FFr1.4bn this year from FFr3.77bn in
1991.
UAP earlier this autumn announced that it would have to recapitalise Banque
Worms, but the final figure of FFr1.4bn was far higher than the FFr1bn
originally expected.
Mr Bloch-Laine is the second Banque Worms executive to have left recently.
Mr Didier Renaudin resigned as managing director a few months ago.
