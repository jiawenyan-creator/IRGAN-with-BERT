  [Text] Dr. Rigoberto Torres, an expert on AIDS, has told 
this newscast that despite significant economic limitations, 
over 60 participants in a new ambulatory program have their food 
supplies guaranteed and the same access to treatment and 
medicines as hospitalized patients. Torres added that the diet 
program includes eggs, meat, fish, milk, tubers, and vegetables 
to bolster the regular diet received by every Cuban citizen. 
Torres acknowledged, however, that this special diet is below 
the 4,000-calorie diet the patients received while at the 
sanatoriums and which is still being provided to those living 
there. 
  The Cuban hospitalization program began in 1986. Since then, 
1,011 HIV carriers have been detected. Epidemiologists believe, 
however, that there could be another 200 undetected cases. So 
far, 164 people have died of AIDS, 12 of them due to unrelated 
causes. Full-blown AIDS currently effects 256 individuals. The 
life expectancy of an HIV carrier in Cuba averages 12 years, 
while the average for AIDS cases is 1.5 years. These indexes are 
relatively high in comparison with world statistics.
