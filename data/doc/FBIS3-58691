  [Text] The year-end tax decree takes effect. Gallo 
extends the audits to nightclubs and multinationals. Dentists 
and clinics will be checked more closely. 
  Rome--A new year, new tasks. The strategy--enacted four days 
ago by the government--that provides for tax increases totaling 
almost 7 trillion lire took effect yesterday. And even though 
the echo of these new measures is still reverberating, further 
measures are already being rumored. Last week it was the Bank of 
Italy speaking of the need for new measures, and in fact the 
government itself--in its master decree--laid the foundations 
for the next increases. 
<H5>  Tobacco Products </H5>
  We accordingly discover that the increase in the price of 
cigarettes has merely been postponed, because on or before 30 
April of each year until 1996, a readjustment of the prices on 
goods sold by the government monopoly will be triggered. With 
the readjustment of certain fixed-sum taxes, the Treasury 
expects in this way to obtain 1.7 trillion lire in increased 
revenues--500 billion for 1994 and 600 billion for each of the 
two subsequent years. 
<H5>  Audits </H5>
  In addition to being a year of taxes, 1994 will also be--if 
the government and the finance minister have their way--a year 
of audits. The GAZZETTA UFFICIALE has published the operational 
antitax evader plan that identifies the categories toward which 
the Finance Guards will primarily direct their attention. They 
are: dentists; doctors who operate in private clinics; companies 
that are involved in mergers; mutual funds; branches of 
multinational companies; public works contractors; sports clubs; 
night clubs [preceding two words in English]; janitorial service 
companies; hotels; beneficiaries of funds for earthquake 
victims; and divorced persons who fail to declare the alimony 
they receive--to name only a few. 
<H5>  Gasoline </H5>
  Everyone who took a trip yesterday found that prices had 
changed at the gasoline pumps and at the toll booths on 
superhighways. The increase was 70 lire for super gasoline and 
50 lire for unleaded, and 4 percent for the tolls. 
<H5>  Alcoholic Beverages </H5>
  Alcoholic beverages will be more expensive in 1994. A 
three-liter bottle of whisky, cognac, or similar product will 
cost an additional 250 lire. 
<H5>  Luxury Goods </H5>

  The surtax on sales of high-powered automobiles and 
motorcycles will remain in effect during all of 1994. At 
registration time, therefore, the surtax paid will be 5 million 
lire for gasoline-powered automobiles of from 21 to 23 
horsepower; 8 million for those of from 24 to 26 horsepower; 10 
million for those of from 27 to 30 horsepower; and 12 million 
for automobiles of more than 30 horsepower. 
  In the case of motorcycles, the increase will be 600,000 
lire 
for motorcycles from 10 to 12 horsepower, and 2 million for 
those of more than 12 horsepower. In the case of used 
automobiles and motorcycles the tax is reduced by 10 percent for 
each year subsequent to the initial registration up to a maximum 
reduction of 50 percent. 
<H5>  Tax Accounting </H5>
  This measure also took effect yesterday. It will enable 
employers and self-employed workers to pay their taxes and 
receive credit for their payments to the Internal Revenue 
Service. Until 31 March--during the start-up phase--the banks 
may limit themselves to accepting such proxy deposits only for 
VAT [value-added tax] payments. The government has accordingly 
established a ceiling on requests for refunds: 40 million lire 
for 1994, 60 million for 1995, and 80 million for 1996. 
Companies with fewer than 100 employees will be exempt from 
having to furnish assistance in the collection of taxes. 
<H5>  Taxation of Capital Gains [preceding two words in English] </H5>
  These measures are contained in the bill to reform the 
capital gains taxes that the Parliament is unlikely to have time 
to pass. In any case--according to the Ciampi 
administration--inheritances and capital gains are not included 
in the IRPEF [personal income tax]. The tax deducted from 
profits will range from 10 percent to 25 percent, while it will 
remain at 12.5 percent on the BOTS [Treasury bills]. The 
taxation on profits from the sale of stock would be based on the 
amounts that brokers would withhold anonymously from the balance 
between profits and losses. A flat 2.5 percent will be deducted 
from dividends. 
<H5>  Value-Added Tax </H5>
  The times of payment were changed as of yesterday. From the 
time of registration, the tax is withheld as of the date of the 
operation. In this way, the state will recover 2.51 trillion 
lire, obviously only for the following year, inasmuch as this is 
an advance payment of the sums owed. 
  Products subject to the 12 percent VAT cost 1 percent more 
as 
of yesterday. The tax on airline tickets, footwear, clothing, 
meat extracts and gravies, corn flakes [preceding two words in 
English], ornamental plants, cork, musical instruments for use 
in teaching, spiny lobsters, European lobsters, oysters, compact 
disks, tapes, videocassettes, soap, wines from fresh grapes, and 
rough lumber. 
  A further increase to 9 percent from 4 percent was 
established for the sale of real estate, and the VAT on luxury 
hotels was increased to 13 percent from 9 percent. 
  Trade between Italy and the Republic of San Marino was also 
made subject to the VAT. 
<H5>  Bank Stamp Tax </H5>
  Stamps on bank checks and deposit receipts, and the 500-lire 
stamp on credit card purchases, will be eliminated as of this 
year, but provision is made for an increase in the tax on 
monthly statements of account (to 2,750 lire from 2,000 lire). 
<H5>  Rural Residences </H5>
  The tax concessions for the purposes of the IRPEF [personal 
income tax] will be eliminated for real estate that is 
classified as rural for tax purposes but that does not have the 
characteristics of rural property. A partial exemption, however, 
has also been granted for tax obligations incurred in the past. 
<H5>  Lottery and Soccer Pools </H5>
  These are the government's latest methods devised by the 
government to recover, in 1994, as much as 1.1 trillion lire. 
They concern the "scratch and win" lottery (you scratch the 
little square and get an immediate response) and Totogol, a 
puzzle involving the number of goals scored in eight games of 
the soccer championship.
