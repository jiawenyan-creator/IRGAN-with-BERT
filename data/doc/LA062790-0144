COUPLE, 73, DECAPITATED 
A 27-year-old man was charged today with decapitating his adoptive parents with 
a saw, police said. 
The bodies of Anthony and Ann Camerlengo, both 73, were discovered Tuesday 
night in the basement of their home. 
The man's legs also were cut off. The couple's heads were found in a storm 
drain down the street early today. 
Thomas Camerlengo was charged with murder and weapons possession, police said. 
The couple's nephew, who lives next door, had notified police after going to 
the home to look for some belongings, said Sgt. Tina Mohrmann, a police 
spokeswoman. 
The handle of a bow saw was found near the bodies, and a bloody blade was in 
the bathroom upstairs, Mohrmann said. 
Police gave no motive for the slayings.
