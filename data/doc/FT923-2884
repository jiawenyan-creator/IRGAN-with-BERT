FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Photo-Me shows 3.8% decline
PHOTO-ME International, the world's largest manufacturer and operator of
automatic photo-booths, reported a 3.8 per cent decline in pre-tax profits,
from Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 16.4m, for the year to April 30.
The fall came on turnover increased by 7 per cent to Pounds 114.8m (Pounds
107.5m) and reflected higher depreciation charges, up from Pounds 9.64m to
Pounds 11m.
Profit before depreciation and tax was ahead by 3 per cent to Pounds 27.5m
(Pounds 26.7m).
Profits before extraordinary items of Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 10m) resulted in
earnings per share of 17.9p (17.06p), helped by slightly lower tax payments
of Pounds 5.42m (Pounds 5.69m) and a reduction in minority interest, which
fell to Pounds 448,000 (Pounds 1.33m).
The group's positive cash flow more than covered capital expenditure of
Pounds 18.2m (Pounds 20.7m) designed to expand the company's customer and
product base.
As expected the group adopted a 'more prudent' approach towards writing off
goodwill associated with the consolidation of its French and Belgian
subsidiaries in June 1991.
Goodwill of Pounds 4.53m at April 30 1991 and a further Pounds 3.24m arising
during the current year were written-off against reserves.
The final dividend is increased to 3.1p (3p) producing a total of 4.4p
(4.2p).
Mr David Miller, managing director, said that although diversification and
expansion had continued, the group will concentrate on its core photographic
and imaging profit-producing activities.
The express systems division continued to grow, increasing operating
revenues to Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 2.4m), and will concentrate on promoting the
self-service printing systems already installed to a wider customer base.
For example, in the US Photo-Me has formed a joint venture with a financial
institution under which its partner buys and owns instant printing machines
producing business cards from Photo-Me, which then operates the machines and
pays the joint venture partner an operating fee. So far 200 machines have
been installed and 1,000 are planned by the end of the year.
The data identification systems division, which serves the growing market
for national identity cards and other forms of identification like driving
licenses and bank cards, is expected to benefit from moves to prevent fraud.
Mr Miller said the identity products fit in with the group's strategy of
generating further demand for photographs and increasing volume.
