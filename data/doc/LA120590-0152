HEALTH; 
PASSIVE SMOKING PERILS STRESSED 
A study found that 91% of nonsmokers were regularly exposed to high levels of 
cigarette smoke, suggesting that the Environmental Protection Agency has 
underestimated the risk of passive smoking, a researcher says. 
Dr. Michael Cummings of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y., 
also said childhood exposure to parents' cigarette smoke could be a greater 
risk than an adult nonsmoker's exposure to a spouse's or colleague's smoke. 
If that is correct, lung cancer could be about to increase among nonsmokers of 
the "baby boom" generation, a result of their parents' widespread adoption of 
smoking after World War II, Cummings said. 
He presented his findings Tuesday at a meeting of an EPA panel considering the 
merits of the agency's draft passive smoking study, which concludes that 
cigarette smoke is a known cause of cancer in nonsmokers.
