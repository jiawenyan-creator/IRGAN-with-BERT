PLATFORM; 
STOP THE HOARDING 
The prospects (for helping inner-city youth in America) are not good. (For 
instance,) the problem of food in Russia is paradoxical in that they've had the 
best wheat harvest in 20 years, but farmers are hoarding. 
They don't trust the marketplace and they figure if they let the people really 
starve and so on, then they can get higher prices, make some more money. 
In America, it's like that. We're trying to entrench, or hoard, our largess. 
For someone to step out and say, "Damn! Let's give your young a piece of the 
action, let's give our young a chance to experience. They're needed and 
valuable" (just isn't happening like it should). 
In our program, we show that love is helping someone like themselves. And that 
concept is so simple, it's difficult for people to grasp. It's from that 
universal truth that people blossom, people self-actualize. And it's from the 
lack of that today that we have the antithesis of self-actualization and 
blossoming. We have destructiveness.
