FT  03 DEC 93 / Turkish trade gap widens
Turkey's consumer boom continues apace with the trade deficit reaching
Dollars 10bn in the third quarter, according to figures released yesterday.
In the nine months to September, imports rose to Dollars 21bn, up 30 per
cent over the same period in 1992, and almost as much as for the whole of
last year. Exports were up just 1.5 per cent over 1992 at Dollars 10.7bn.
While the rest of Europe pulls slowly out of recession, Turkey is enjoying
strong growth fuelled by easier domestic credit and increased foreign
capital inflows.
In the third quarter gross national product grew by 7.9 per cent, against 12
per cent in the second quarter. Growth for the year is projected at 8 per
cent. Vehicle output is 27 per cent higher than in 1992.
