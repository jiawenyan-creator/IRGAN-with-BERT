  [Text] Xining, May 25 (XINHUA) -- North-west China's 
Qinghai Province has been forging closer overseas economic ties 
to promote local economic development. 
  Last month, a delegation of the province visited the United 
States to solicit business and netted 533 million U.S. dollars' 
worth of investment intentions. 
  This formed a sharp contrast with the situation in 1980, 
when 
the province exported a mere 4.02 million U.S. dollars' worth of 
goods, all just to Hong Kong and Macao. 
  In 1993, the province exported 100 million U.S. dollars' 
worth of products to over 120 countries worldwide. 
  By the end of 1993, the province had seen the pouring-in of 
430 million U.S. dollars' worth of investments by businesses 
from 14 countries and regions, including the United States, 
Japan, Australia, Hong Kong and others. 
  Over the past decade, the province has also imported 64.7 
million U.S. dollars' worth of advanced equipment and technology 
from overseas. The figure for the January-April period of this 
year was 11.9 million U.S. dollars. 
  Since 1992, the province has taken part in or held trade 
talks in Xian, Urumqi and Hong Kong, in a drive to promote its 
image. 
  The province has been upgrading its transport and 
telecommunications systems to improve its investment 
environment. It has also started law consultancy, accounting, 
international transport, insurance and other services to 
overseas businesses operating in the province. 
  On the other hand, the province has received a total 80 
million U.S. dollars in overseas donations and free aid in 
recent years. 
  The authorities expect that foreign investment and overseas 
preferential loans to the province will hit 200 million U.S. 
dollars this year.
