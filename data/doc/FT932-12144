FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Mexican telephone utility
disappoints
TELEFONOS de Mexico (Telmex), Mexico's largest private company and monopoly
telephone utility, disappointed the market by announcing net profits of
2.02bn new pesos (Dollars 651m) for the first quarter, 4.3 per cent less
than in the same period of 1992.
Telmex's revenue growth was 3.5 per cent compared to the fourth quarter of
last year and was lower than expected.
Tariffs increased in real terms by 3.5 per cent, compared with the fourth
quarter, and line growth was 2.2 per cent. But a marked slowdown in
long-distance and international traffic had helped depress sales.
Mr Mickey Schleien of Morgan Stanley commented: 'The real problem is the
above-the-line figures. We were hoping for sequential revenue growth of 6.9
per cent.'
Mr Schleien said the reduction in net profits was expected mainly because
Telmex had reported a foreign exchange loss of 52m pesos in the first
quarter, compared with a foreign exchange gain in the first quarter of 1992
totalling 161m pesos.
A Telmex official blamed the reduction in traffic on the low growth in the
Mexican economy in the first quarter.
Telmex installed 145,000 new lines in the first quarter, pushing the total
number of lines up to 6.889m, 11.8 per cent up on March 1992.
