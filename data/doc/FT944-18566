FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: Air France reduces loss to
FFr2.61bn
Air France, the French state-owned airline, reduced losses for the first
half of the year to FFr2.61bn (Dollars 495m) from FFr3.82bn in the same
period in 1993.
The French flag carrier, which is in the midst of a restructuring package
after several years of substantial losses, has said it hopes to limit losses
to about FFr3.7bn in the 15 months to the end of March 1995. In 1993, the
airline had a net deficit of FFr8.48bn.
In an attempt to return to profits, Mr Christian Blanc, chairman, has
implemented a restructuring package aimed at increasing productivity by 30
per cent by 1997. The plan is to be accompanied by a capital injection of
FFr20bn from the French state over the period.
Air France cited some signs of encouragement in the first six months. It
said that sales had stabilised after the sharp decline of 1993 and totalled
FFr27.5bn. The overall figure masked an increase in volume sales of about
10.6 per cent, which was offset by price reductions as the company sought to
win back passengers from rival airlines.
Operating profits rose from FFr657m to FFr1.61bn. According to Air France,
it was only from April that the underlying results started to benefit from
the restructuring and cost-cutting plans from April.
The company has been pursuing a series of asset sales to help reduce debts,
which amounted to about FFr40bn at the beginning of the year. Last month,
Air France announced the long-awaited decision to sell its controlling stake
in the Meridien hotels chain to Forte.
Expenditure on acquisitions totalled FFr4.94bn during the period. This
principally represented the purchase of aircraft, including three Airbus
A340s and two Boeing 767s.
The period since the end of June has brought a reorganisation of the group
structure. Air France has sold its holding in Air Inter, its domestic
subsidiary, to a new holding company which groups the two carriers'
interests.
