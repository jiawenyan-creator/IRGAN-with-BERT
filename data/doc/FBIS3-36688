  [Text] Moscow February 8 TASS -- The Russian State Duma 
proposed to the Foreign Ministry to replace certain ambassadors, 
according to Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the parliamentary 
Foreign Affairs Committee. 
  Lukin did not provide any names, but told TASS on Tuesday 
that his committee had "submitted to the Foreign Ministry 
proposals regarding appointments and recall of diplomatic 
representatives abroad -- ambassadors, consuls and 
representatives in international organisations". 
  According to the constitution, it is the Russian president 
who appoints and dismisses ambassadors after consultations with 
corresponding parliamentary commissions and committees. 
  Lukin admitted that the proposals of his committee can be 
disregarded by the president. The notion of "consultations" 
does not strictly define whether "the president is obliged to 
agree with recommendations of the chamber and its committee or 
can ignore them", he said and added that his committee would 
continue to work according to the powers vested with it by the 
constitution. 
  On Monday the Russian president accepted the resignation of 
Ivan Silayev, the Russian representative in EC.
