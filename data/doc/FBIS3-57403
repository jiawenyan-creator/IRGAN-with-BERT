  [Text] Linas Linkevicius, the Lithuanian national defense 
minister, has denied an ELTA report that he had signed a Defense 
Cooperation Treaty with France. Linas Linkevicius confirmed to 
a Baltic News Service correspondent that the text of the treaty 
was finally coordinated during a visit last Friday and Saturday 
in Vilnius by French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure. 
  According to the national defense minister, two 
possibilities 
of signing the treaty are being considered: Either the French 
defense minister arrives in Vilnius, and a corresponding 
invitation has been dispatched, or Linas Linkevicius will go to 
Paris. 
  The counsellor of the French Embassy in Lithuania, [name 
indistinct], told a Baltic News Service correspondent that the 
Defense Cooperation Treaty provided for the training of military 
experts, the exchange of experts, and consultations on various 
aspects of both countries' defense doctrines.
