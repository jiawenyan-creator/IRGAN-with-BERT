RARE QUAKE ROCKS ALBUQUERQUE 
The Albuquerque area was rocked overnight by a rare earthquake with a magnitude 
of 4.5, the U.S. Geological Survey said today. 
No reports of casualties or damage were received, a spokeswoman for the agency 
said in Golden, Colo. 
Scientists at the survey's Earthquake Information Center said the quake 
occurred about midnight, was centered 25 miles north of Socorro and was felt in 
the Socorro and Albuquerque areas. 
The last significant tremor in the area occurred in July, 1906, said Pat 
Jorgenson, a spokeswoman for the geological agency.
