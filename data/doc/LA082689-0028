STRANGE BEHAVIOR? FAN GOT WHAT HE DESERVED 
Allen Brogan (Viewpoint, Aug. 19) obviously has no idea of the pressure 
involved in playing the last nine holes of a major golf championship. 
The spectator in the Curtis Strange incident deserved what he got. Before 
Strange approached his shot, he was distracted, and he asked the spectators to 
please be quiet and to show a little courtesy. 
This obviously didn't have any bearing and Strange reacted as any normal human 
being in that situation would. These incidents happen day in and day out on the 
PGA Tour, and I'm glad the public was able to witness it on national TV. 
Furthermore, there shouldn't be talk about rest-of-the-year suspensions and 
Ryder Cup banishments. Brogan must follow baseball and football, where 
suspensions are a normality. Trust me, the commissioner of golf would not allow 
our sport to be lowered to that level.
