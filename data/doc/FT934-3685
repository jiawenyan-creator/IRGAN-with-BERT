FT  08 DEC 93 / Names in no mood to accept offers
Names on the worst Gooda Walker syndicates were still waiting to hear full
details of how the Lloyd's settlement would affect them, but were suspicious
of the sums being offered.
Mrs Valerie Baker, who with her husband has Pounds 2m outstanding in calls
from Lloyd's, said: 'All I can say is it is an admission on Lloyd's part
that they haven't been running the shop right. We haven't had any personal
details yet. But it would have to be a pretty high-level offer for us to
accept.'
Some Names had already heard the decision by their action groups to reject
the settlement and were resolving to support this view. Ms Fernanda Herford
said: 'I gather it's 'no'. I didn't expect much. It's business as usual,
except some of us are very depressed. Hope springs eternal, I suppose.'
Mr Norbert Mallet said: 'I don't feel this is reasonable. We were happy to
pay legitimate claims but there is no way we are going to pay illegitimate
claims. We are going to court and we are going to win, so why accept a
compromise?
'The fact that Lloyd's has put up an offer shows they are going to lose. Why
should we accept less than 100 per cent? It's just not on.'
Mr Hugh Taylor said: 'It doesn't seem very brilliant. It is most unlikely I
will accept. I consider I've been dealt with dishonestly and dishonourably
and I am entitled to an apology and some compensation for the stress I have
suffered. I could not have been worse treated by Lloyd's. My feeling is let
them all rot in hell.'
