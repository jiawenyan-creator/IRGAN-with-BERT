FT  18 FEB 94 / Troubled shipyard declares a profit
The long-troubled Govan shipyard on the Clyde made its first profit in 30
years last year, its owner, Norwegian-based Kvaerner group, said yesterday.
Kvaerner described the profit as 'small' and declined to give a precise
figure. But it forecast a profit for this year of between Dollars 4m and
Dollars 5m.
Mr Jan Magne Heggelund, Kvaerner's senior vice-president for finance, said
Govan, which employs 1,500 workers, had orders that stretched into 1995.
These included four chemical tankers, and the last ship presently under
construction was not due for delivery until late 1996.
'We are working on various projects,' he said when asked about the
longer-term outlook.
Kvaerner acquired the Govan yard from British Shipbuilders in 1988 for
Pounds 6m, and has invested heavily in raising its efficiency since then.
The yard's fortunes were improved largely because of a broad restructuring
and efficiency improvements as it secured new orders valued at NKr853m
(Pounds 773m) compared with no new orders in 1992.
Mr Heggelund said the company would continue to invest in the yard.
