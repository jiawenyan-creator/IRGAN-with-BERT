FT  24 SEP 92 / Maxwell probe fees detailed
ACCOUNTANTS AND lawyers to the Maxwell private companies have charged as
fees 10 per cent of the proceeds from sales of assets so far raised, the
Commons social security committee learned yesterday.
Mr John Talbot, head of insolvency at Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm,
who is one of the administrators to the companies, said realisations by the
end of July were Pounds 110m.
The administrators' fees were Pounds 6m up to that date, including Pounds 4m
already billed. The legal fees so far were Pounds 5m, of which Pounds 4m has
already been billed.
Arthur Andersen's own billed time rose to a maximum of 18,000 hours in
January, falling to just over 6,000 hours by the end of July.
The realisations included the sale of 52 of the 55 trading businesses
controlled by the administrators.
So far, investigations costing Pounds 400,000 have yielded recoveries of
Pounds 4m. Administration and legal costs yet to lead to recoveries have
totalled Pounds 3m to date.
Separately, Mr Talbot said that total cash outflows from the private
companies last year were Pounds 1.2bn. That included Pounds 204m in offshore
purchases of shares in MCC and MGN, in addition to Pounds 45m which was
disclosed in the accounts.
There were bank loan repayments of Pounds 261m, overdraft repayments of
Pounds 240m and loan interest and bank charges of Pounds 123m. A further
Pounds 5m is under investigation.
There was also Pounds 25m allocated last year to PH (US), a US-based company
ultimately controlled by the Maxwell Foundation, based in Liechtenstein.
He said there had been 114 transactions with trusts, and said most had taken
place in 1991, although his team was also examining transactions during 1989
and 1990.
Cash inflows last year included Pounds 194m from Bishopsgate Investment
Management, which Mr Talbot said he believed was largely 'pensioners'
money'. There was also Pounds 37m gained with the acquisition of the New
York Daily News, and Pounds 239m in new bank loans and overdrafts.
There has been criticism from Maxwell pensioners of the level of
professional fees.
