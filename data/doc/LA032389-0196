WORLD; 
'FIGHT OVER,' BOTHA AGREES TO RETIRE 
The power struggle between President Pieter W. Botha and the new leader of the 
National Party, F. W. de Klerk, has been resolved, and Botha will retire after 
an election later this year, a newspaper reported today. 
"The fight is over," an unidentified government source told The Star, South 
Africa's largest-selling daily. The compromise was reached in a meeting 
Tuesday. Botha, 73, suffered a stroke Jan. 18 and spent eight weeks 
recuperating. He resigned as leader of the governing National Party on Feb. 2 
and was replaced by De Klerk.
