ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AFTER THE EVACUATION; 
PLACENTIA; 
EXTERMINATOR TRUCK CRASHES, SPILLING PESTICIDE 
A termite control truck carrying containers of pesticides overturned Friday, 
spilling a bug-killing chemical in a Placentia intersection and forcing 
authorities to evacuate more than 100 people in the area. 
The truck driver, Sal Rapabas, 26, of El Monte, suffered minor injuries when 
his vehicle collided with another small truck. No one else was hurt in the 
accident, which occurred about 9:20 a.m. at the intersection of Yorba Linda 
Boulevard and Kraemer Avenue. 
Officials evacuated more than 100 people at the nearby El Torito Shopping 
Center and at a Fidelity Bank office as a precaution. 
At least one 30-gallon container of the bug-killing chemical Dursban burst and 
spilled in the intersection, Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman Patti 
Range said. The chemical can cause a burning sensation if it comes in contact 
with skin or is inhaled, but there were no reports of injuries due to 
inhalation, she said. 
Rapabas, an employee of the Home Care Termite Control Co. in Anaheim, was 
treated for minor injuries at Placentia-Linda Community Hospital, Range said. 
The intersection was closed for about 2 hours while hazardous materials teams 
neutralized the chemical, Range said. She said the chemical was doused with 
bleach to neutralize it and that none of it seeped into storm drains.
