FT  31 MAR 92 / Pearson profits fall to Pounds 173.8m
PEARSON, the publishing, banking and industrial group, is actively looking
for possible publishing acquisitions in Asia and the Pacific region, Lord
Blakenham, chairman and chief executive, said yesterday.
He was announcing better than expected pre-tax profits of Pounds 173.8m for
1991, compared with Pounds 226.3m for 1990 - a fall of 23 per cent.
In most areas of Pearson's business, organic growth was considered a more
profitable way to expand but deals for the oil services division were
possible, he said.
Pearson, which owns the Financial Times, promised recovery in the second
half of 1991 after profits in that year's first half fell 58 per cent to
Pounds 41m, compared with Pounds 98m in 1990. 'In the event our optimism was
justified,' said Lord Blakenham.
Turnover rose to Pounds 1.6bn compared with Pounds 1.535bn in 1990. There
was a 23 per cent fall in earnings per share from 58.5p to 45.3p, although a
final dividend of 12.5p was paid, making an unchanged total of 23.25p. The
company also announced a one-for-one scrip issue.
Mr Frank Barlow, group managing director, said the turnround at British Sky
Broadcasting, in which Pearson has a more than 16 per cent stake, had been
remarkably quick. 'I would be very surprised if BSkyB doesn't start to turn
out an overall profit in the second half of 1993,' he said.
'The result is rather better than expected,' said Mr Eric de Bellaigue,
publishing analyst at stockbrokers Panmure Gordon, who is now looking for
Pounds 200m this year.
He described Pearson as 'a very sound business' and noted dividend cover of
1.9 times, interest cover of 9.9 times and a debt/equity ratio which fell
from 57 per cent in 1990 to 12 per cent in 1991.
Pearson increased trading profits in two of its sectors - oil services rose
15 per cent to Pounds 34.7m and books rose 7 per cent to Pounds 59.7m.
Newspapers fell 38 per cent to Pounds 29.7m.
Entertainment fell 37 per cent to Pounds 12.7m partly because of the effects
of the Gulf war; investment banking fell 32 per cent to Pounds 26.1m; and
fine china suffered a 23 per cent fall in trading profit to Pounds 17.5m.
The Pearson share price rose 8p to 794p.
