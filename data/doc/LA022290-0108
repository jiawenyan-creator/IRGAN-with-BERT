VOLCANO PROMPTS OIL SAFETY RULES 
Redoubt Volcano erupted without warning, sending gritty ash raining down south 
of Anchorage, and the Coast Guard demanded stepped-up precautions at an oil 
depot on Cook Inlet. The Drift River terminal had been ordered closed to guard 
against an oil spill being caused by a future eruption, but the Coast Guard 
relented and said the terminal must empty six of its seven storage tanks and 
have cleanup equipment ready.
