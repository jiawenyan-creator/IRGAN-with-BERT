METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
 RENAISSANCE FAIRE NEGOTIATING NEW SITE 
Renaissance Pleasure Faire officials have been negotiating with the owners of 
Big Sky Ranch north of Simi Valley to rent about 100 acres in eastern Ventura 
County for the annual festival, a spokesman said. 
A lease agreement is "all worked out" but access to the property on Tapo Canyon 
Road remains an obstacle to getting a permit from Ventura County, fair 
spokesman Kevin Patterson said. 
Organizers have been looking for a place to hold the event since April when the 
Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission approved a developer's request 
to build a gated community on the fair's longtime site in Agoura. 
Officials must obtain a permit from the county to hold the fair on eight 
consecutive weekends this summer, county planner Paul Porter said.
