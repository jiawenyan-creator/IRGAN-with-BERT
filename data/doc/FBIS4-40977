  [Text] The sending of Russian peacekeeping forces to 
Abkhazia is of great significance for Russia, because the 
settlement of the conflict and the stabilization of the 
situation in this dangerous zone are very important, Russia's 
Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov told INTERFAX. 
  "The Caucasus and the Transcaucasus are two mutually related 
regions," said Pastukhov. "A fire in one of them may spread to 
the other. From the international point of view, Russia has 
always played the role of peacemaker, guided by U.N. norms and 
requirements," he added. 
  He also said that this operation would differ from the 
previous ones in that Russian peacekeepers would work jointly 
with U.N. observers.
