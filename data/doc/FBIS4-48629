  [Text] The chairman of the National Constitutional 
Conference Elections Committee, Mr. Bernard Mba, has expressed 
satisfaction with the conduct of today's elections. He told 
newsmen after visiting some polling stations in Abuja that the 
exercise was generally peaceful in the country. Mr. Mba said 
reports so far received from states show that the turnout for 
the elections was impressive while there has not been any report 
of electoral malpractices. The chairman said he was 
particularly delighted that the exercise started and ended on 
schedule. A Radio Nigeria Network correspondent reports that 
the four-hour tour took the chairman to Abaje, Gwagwalada, 
Karimu, and Abuja municipal areas.
