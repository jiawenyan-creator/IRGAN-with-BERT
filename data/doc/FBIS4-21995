<F P=106> [Peter Grolig report: "Northern Iraq: `Blood Money' for UN </F>
Policemen?"] 
  [Excerpt] A rumor is circulating among the UN policemen 
employed in northern Iraq: The Iraqi intelligence service is 
said to have offered "blood money." Reportedly, it pays about 
$10,000 for the death of a member of the United Nations Guards 
Contingent (UNGCI). 
  "The servant of the base was the first who reported on it," 
an inspector, who had recently returned home, told KURIER. 
"From that time onward, we heard again and again that our death 
would bring the murderer much money." 
  First Lieutenant Gerald Hesztera from the Interior Ministry 
in Vienna, who is responsible for the 50 Austrian policemen 
participating in UN missions all over the world, qualifies this: 
"There is no proof of that." 
  "You feel that you have been hit, you feel the pain... you 
hear the shots and you wait and see whether you are hit once 
again." Ferry Elsholz, 32, policeman from Vienna, had a close 
shave during the mission in northern Iraq. A projectile ripped 
his thigh open and penetrated the bone. The same bullet hit the 
neck of WEGA [expansion unknown] man Heinz Morgenbesser, 28, and 
got stuck under his right ear. 
  "I thought that this is the end," Morgenbesser remembered 
when KURIER was permitted to visit him in the AKH hospital in 
Vienna. 
  Elsholz and Morgenbesser had been taken there after the 
attack on Palm Sunday. As reported, part of the UN contingent 
had set off for home via Mosul and Baghdad when the assassins 
opened fire with a bazooka and kalashnikovs about half an hour 
after the departure of the UN vehicle. [passage omitted]
