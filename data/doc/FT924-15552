FT  03 OCT 92 / Phones may transmit data from ambulances
BRITAIN'S ambulance service may be catching on to high technology.
A project run by the Department of Health's Trauma Centre based in north
Staffordshire is testing the use of cellular phones to transmit
heart-tracing data between ambulances and hospitals.
The trial project to use cellular phones on ambulances is thought to be the
first of its kind in the UK and is part of a government-backed study to look
into ways of improving communications in the ambulance service.
Ambulances in the UK now use two-way radio, which is a much less reliable
form of communication than cellular telephony. When the radio link fails,
ambulance crew are forced to use public pay phones.
The radio communications network is not used in the UK to transmit heart
data but experiments in the US found radio communications unreliable for
that purpose, says Mr Simon Davies, an accident and emergency nurse at Keele
University who is participating in the project,
Cellular telephony, on the other hand, can handle large volumes of data and
voice very rapidly and is much more reliable. In the US, cellular telephones
are commonly used by ambulances.
The Trauma Centre's project is targeted specifically at heart attack
patients. ECG heart tracing machines are installed in ambulances to read
heart data which is transmitted directly to the hospital by connecting the
ECG unit to a cellular phone.
The use of the cellular phone network also enables the ambulance paramedics
to receive advise directly and reliably from specialists at the hospital and
take speedy and appropriate action.
The high-fidelity communication between ambulance and hospital offered by
cellular phones means that the patient can be directed to the nearest
hospital equipped to deal with the specific case. The centre will use
cellular phone supplied by Motorola of the US.
