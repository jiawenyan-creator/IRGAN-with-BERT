Subpart A_General Provisions



84.1 

Purpose.



The purpose of the regulations contained in this part 84 is: 

(a) To establish procedures and prescribe requirements which must be met in filing applications for approval by the
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of respirators or changes or modifications of approved respirators;

(b) To establish a schedule of fees to be charged each applicant for the inspections, examinations, and testing conducted
by the Institute under the provisions of this part; 

(c) To provide for the issuance of certificates of approval or modifications of certificates of approval for respirators
which have met the applicable construction, performance, and respiratory protection requirements set forth in
this part; and

(d) To specify minimum requirements and to prescribe methods to be employed by the Institute and by the applicant in
conducting inspections, examinations, and tests to determine the effectiveness of respirators used during entry
into or escape from hazardous atmospheres.

(c) 

Approved 

means conforming to the minimum requirements of this part 84.

(d) 

Auxiliary equipment

 means a self-contained breathing apparatus, the use of which is limited in underground mine rescue and recovery operations

slow response.

(h) 

Dust

 means a solid mechanically produced particle with a size ranging from submicroscopic to macroscopic.

(i) Respirators 

for entry into and escape from 

means respiratory devices providing protection during entry into and escape from hazardous atmospheres.

(j) Respirators 

for escape only 

means respiratory devices providing protection only during escape from hazardous atmospheres.

(k) A 

facepiece

 or 

mouthpiece

 is a respirator component designed to provide a gas-tight or dust-tight fit with the face and may include headbands,
valves, and connections for canisters, cartridges, filters, or respirable gas source.

(l)
