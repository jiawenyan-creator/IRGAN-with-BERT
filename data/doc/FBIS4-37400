  [Text] Abu Dhabi, 21 Jun (MENA) -- Citing high-ranking 
Turkish sources, AL-ITTIHAD newspaper today states that weapons 
have been shipped to north Yemen from Romania since early June. 
Giant Russian Ilyushin 76 cargo planes carry the weapons via 
(?Utabani) airport in Bucharest and cross Turkish airspace twice 
a day, going to Yemen at night and returning empty the next day. 
  According to the sources, the Romanian flights had obtained 
permission to transport vegetables across Turkish airspace. 
This has been verified through technological methods by air 
control units. 
  Since no ban has been imposed on weapons shipments to Yemen, 
Turkey cannot take any measures to interrupt these flights, the 
sources said. 
  In another development, AL-ITTIHAD has learned from sources 
in Cairo that one of the formulas put forward during the meeting 
in Cairo between the UN secretary general's envoy Lakhdar 
Brahimi and a north Yemeni delegation was to set up an Arab and 
Islamic force to supervise the cease-fire under UN auspices. 
The north Yemeni delegation did not respond to the proposal, 
requesting to refer it to the government, while the chairman of 
the southern delegation welcomed it. 
  The paper adds that Brahimi promised to provide UN funds for 
these troops to give them international status and make the 
proposal acceptable to all parties concerned.
