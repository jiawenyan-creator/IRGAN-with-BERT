FT  30 MAY 92 / Letter: Problems of non-profit status
Sir, Can Mark Hayes ('The Archbishop, shareholders and re-thinking the
purpose and standards of business', May 16) explain the attraction of
investing in non-profit enterprises in Third World countries?
My company trains managers from developing countries on residential and
outreach programmes. Its registration as a not-for-profit association does
not mean that we do not have to be profitable since expansion has to be
financed and assets renewed.
In the face of a continuously growing demand for services it is impossible
to fund all the consequential capital requirements from internal sources.
Attracting new capital is, therefore, essential to growth. However, while
non-profit status is an important factor in attracting funding for our
programmes, it prevents us from paying dividends to shareholders.
