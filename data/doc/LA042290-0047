POP EYE: ON THE TOWN: 
Even if Little Richard didn't do the ceremony, producer Chuck Plotkin and his 
New Jersey-born bride, Wendy Brand Chaft, had plenty of musical fireworks at 
their wedding reception last weekend in Santa Monica. Of course, not everyone's 
as well connected as Plotkin, one of Bruce Springsteen's longtime producers and 
confidantes. 
The Boss returned the favor by performing "It's Gonna Work Out Fine" (with 
Jimmy Wood), saluting the bride by doing "Jersey Girl," accompanied by Tom 
Waits, who handled a solo version of "Fever." The squad of post-nuptial 
background vocalists included Patti Scialfa, Andrew Gold and Karla Bonoff. . . 
. At his second show at the Universal Amphitheatre last weekend, Van Morrison 
brought out Robbie Robertson to play guitar for a lengthy jam-version of 
"Moondance." . . . And if you're hungry for outrageous, Vegas-style nightmare 
pop theater, don't miss Bubba Lou Vickers (otherwise known as Bud E. Luv), who 
makes a rare appearance Thursday at Cafe Largo on Fairfax. The post-modern 
lounge artist's act includes a medley of three B.J. Thomas hits and a 
drum-machine version of Bobby Brown's "My Prerogative."
