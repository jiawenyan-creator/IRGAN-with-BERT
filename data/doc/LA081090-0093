PARRISH ENDS 0-FOR-21 DROUGHT WITH GAME-WINNING HR IN 11TH 
Lance Parrish dreaded facing Red Sox reliever Dennis Lamp in the 11th inning 
late Wednesday night. 
"If there's anybody in the game who's got my number, it's him," Parrish said. 
But other pitchers could have made the same claim, Parrish having gone hitless 
in 21 previous at-bats. 
"It's been pretty frustrating," Parrish said. "It feels good to finally get a 
hit and make it count." 
Parrish ended his slump with a two-run home run into the left-field seats, 
giving the Angels an 8-6 victory in a game that took 4 hours 6 minutes. 
Parrish's hit took the burden of guilt off Dave Winfield, whose misplay of 
Carlos Quintana's seventh-inning fly ball led to a four-run rally that put the 
Red Sox ahead, 6-2. 
"I'm glad we came back," said Winfield, who began a three-run outburst in the 
eighth with a single to left and started the ninth with a walk. "I didn't want 
that on my conscience. That really opened the floodgates." 
Once the Angels turned the tide, Boston's bullpen couldn't hold them back. Red 
Sox Manager Joe Morgan has begun to wonder whether his club can hold off its 
American League East rivals without stopper Jeff Reardon, who was lost to back 
surgery. 
"It's awful to let that club get that many runs against you late in the game," 
Morgan said. "I will be (concerned) if things continue this way, believe me. If 
you don't get quality relief pitching, it's all over."
