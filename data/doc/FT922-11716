FT  24 APR 92 / Top price for Korean lacquer box: Saleroom
A SMALL Korean stationery box, inlaid with lacquer and made during the 16th
century, sold for Dollars 550,000 (Pounds 312,000) at Christie's in New York
on Wednesday. It was a record price for an item of Korean lacquer and
trebled the estimate.
In the past two years, new collectors of works of art in Korea and Taiwan
have come to the aid of the international auction houses, whose turnover
declined sharply when the Japanese stopped buying Impressionist and Modern
pictures.
The Far East is now a leading fine art centre.
Christie's auction of Korean works of art totalled Dollars 2.9m with 19 per
cent unsold, suggesting that buyers are becoming more selective.
A hanging scroll of the 14th century, depicting the Willow-Branch
Avalokitesvara, a Buddhist deity widely worshipped in Korea at this period,
was on target at Dollars 385,000.
The auction houses are still trying to tempt Japanese buyers. On Wednesday
Christie's held its first auction devoted to modern Japanese paintings. Only
eight of the 20 lots sold, but 'Work no. 10' by the abstract artist Saito
Yoshishige, was within its forecast at Dollars 165,000.
