FT  18 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Abolition of wages councils
attacked
THE decision to abolish wages councils covering some 2.5m low-paid workers
showed the Tories' 'moral degradation', Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow
employment secretary, said yesterday.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, insisted they were an arbitrary
and outdated structure and an obstacle to creating new jobs.
But the move came under fire from a former Tory employment minister as Mr
Peter Bottomley warned that he would vote against abolition at a later stage
of debate on the employment bill. Given the recessionary pressures for rates
of pay for such workers to be reduced even more, it was wrong to remove
wages councils' protection, he said.
Labour signalled that this 'nastiest' element of the bill will attract
fiercest opposition, and accused ministers of pandering to their sponsors in
business. The policy would enable bad employers to undercut competitors at
the expense of employees and of taxpayers, who would have to fund extra
social security benefits.
