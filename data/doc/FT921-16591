FT  02 JAN 92 / Appointments: B-M's international reshuffle
Larry Snoddon, president of BURSON-MARSTELLER's European operations, is
returning to New York to become chief executive of the world's second
biggest public relations firm.
Snoddon's promotion is part of a top management reshuffle in which the
agency is also creating two new positions; Thomas Bell and Thomas Mosser
both become chief operating officers. Bell, a relatively recent recruit to
B-M, remains in Washington, but Mosser, president of B-M Americas, will be
based in London. James Lindheim will take over as chairman of B-M's European
operations overseeing 23 offices in 15 countries and a staff of 750.
B-M seems to have fared better than Shandwick and Hill &amp; Knowlton, its two
biggest rivals, in the current economic downturn. Under Snoddon, B-M Europe
has tripled its income in four years and the group's worldwide revenues are
expected to rise by about 5 per cent, to Dollars 220m this year, with a
similar sort of growth budgeted for next year.
B-M, which employs around 2,000 staff worldwide, provides around a third of
the profits of the privately-owned Young &amp; Rubicam group. The 46-year-old
Snoddon believes that its recent success may partly reflect the fact that it
does not face the same sort of short-term financial pressures as a public
company.
