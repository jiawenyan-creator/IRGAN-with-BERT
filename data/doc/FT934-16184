FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Third-quarter results hit AMD
share price
SHARES in US semiconductor manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices continued to
fall yesterday following the company's announcement the previous day of
third-quarter results that failed to live up to analysts' expectations.
At mid-session, AMD's share price had slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 21 1/4
. Other semiconductor companies, such as Intel Motorola, 8 and Texas
Instruments, which had followed AMD lower on Tuesday, were slightly higher
in early trading yesterday.
AMD's third-quarter net income rose 25 per cent to Dollars 61.3m before
preferred stock dividends, or 61 cents a share after dividend payments. In
the same period last year net income was Dollars 49.1m, or 51 cents on the
same basis. Revenues rose 17 per cent for the quarter, to Dollars 418.4m
from Dollars 356.7m.
Analysts had forecast third-quarter income of about 66 cents a share,
following second-quarter net earnings of 65 cents a share. AMD's share price
drop reflected 'downbeat' comments by company executives, analysts said.
However, Mr W. J. Sanders III, AMD chairman and chief executive, said the
company had had 'another outstanding quarter', noting that operating income
rose more than 50 per cent compared with the same period last year. 'We are
on track to achieve a third consecutive year of record sales and earnings,'
said Mr Sanders.
Revenues were boosted by sales of AMD's latest 'clone' of the Intel
microprocessors used in personal computers. Sales of 486 microprocessors
more than offset declining sales of the 386 microprocessor and seasonally
slow sales of most other product lines, AMD said. AMD is involved in legal
battles with Intel over intellectual property rights that have shadowed its
success in the microprocessor market.
