  [Text] Head of the North Ossetian Government Sergey 
Khetagurov described the presidential elections scheduled for 
January 16 as "extremely untimely." According to INTERFAX 
sources, Khetagurov told North Ossetian intellectuals that the 
first round of elections would be unlikely to bring about 
definite results. 
  He urged the voters to rally around the future president and 
prevent a social split irrespective of the election results. 
  The Central Electoral Commission informed INTERFAX, 
meanwhile, that 6 out of the 8 candidates would continue the 
presidential race. Two candidates, among them former first 
secretary of the North Ossetian Communist Party Committee 
Aleksandr Dzasokhov, have withdrawn their candidacies. 
  Dzasokhov stated that he had removed his candidacy "in the 
interests of social consolidation and victory of the sound 
forces".
