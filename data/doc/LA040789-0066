MORNING REPORT: MOVIES 
From Overseas: West German film director Wim Wenders will replace American 
Francis Coppola as president of the Cannes Film Festival jury May 11-23. 
Coppola changed his plans because of "professional commitments." Wenders won 
the festival's Golden Palm Award for best film in 1984 for "Paris, Texas." . . 
. In Rome, Gina Lollobrigida, Nino Manfredi, Raf Vallone and other Italian 
screen stars have launched a campaign to reduce the growing number of foreign 
actors used in Italian films. "We have to defend ourselves, they do it in other 
countries, why not here?" Lollobrigida said at a meeting of the Union of 
Italian Actors. Italian directors often dub actors' voices after the film is 
shot, making it easy to use foreign actors. "The difference between a foreign 
actor who comes to Italy and the Italian actor who goes abroad is that the 
Italian must speak the language of that country," Vallone said. ALEENE MacMINN
