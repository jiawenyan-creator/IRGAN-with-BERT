FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Field oversubscribed and goes to ballot
THE PUBLIC offer for sale of shares in Field Group, the carton maker, was
7.4 times subscribed and smaller applications will go into a ballot for
shares.
Ballots are generally used in cases of heavy over-subscription for new
issues, and were frequently used at times when the flotation market became
overheated.
Bankers yesterday were trying to recall when a ballot was last used, giving
examples such as the flotations of Harry Ramsden's, the fish and chip shop,
in 1989 and Thorntons, the chocolate retailer, in 1988.
The group offered 12.1m shares to the public after placing 22.5m shares with
institutions. There were 46,280 applications in the public offer for a total
of 89.7m shares.
When the issue was priced at 250p a share some analysts said the pricing was
on the high side, giving an historic p/e of 17.7.
Dealings will start on Wednesday July 7.
Mr Keith Gilchrist, chief executive, said he was pleased with the response.
Field and its advisers had run various methods of allocating the shares
through a computer but could not find a way to allocate economic quantities
of shares without a ballot.
Applications for 200 to 500 shares will go into a weighted ballot for 200
shares, and applications for 750 to 2,000 shares will be in a weighted
ballot for 400 shares.
Higher applications will be scaled down, with 3,000 to 10,000 share requests
getting 13.5 per cent of the amount, and applicants for 15,000 to 500,000
getting 10 per cent. Applications above 500,000 will get nothing.
Over half of those who applied will get something, but those in the ballot
have about a one in three chance of success.
Cheques submitted for unsuccessful applications will not be cashed.
