FT  15 OCT 92 / S Korea's DLP loses more MPs
SOUTH Korea's ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) yesterday appeared in
danger of losing its slim parliamentary majority.
A decision by five MPs to leave the party reduced the DLP's representation
to 154 seats in the 299-member National Assembly.
The DLP is being convulsed by an internal dispute over the party leadership
and the defection of more MPs is expected within the next few days.
They are likely to form a new conservative party to oppose Mr Kim Young-sam,
the DLP nominee in the December presidential election.
The DLP lost its parliamentary majority by one seat in last March's National
Assembly elections, but was then able to retain control of the unicameral
chamber by persuading 10 independent MPs to join the ruling party.
The DLP previously had a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The rebellion within is being staged by MPs associated with President Roh's
majority faction.
They believe that Mr Kim is gaining too much power in spite of his minority
status in the DLP.
