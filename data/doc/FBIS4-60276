  [Text] One of the leaders of Fatah in the Gaza Strip, 
Furayh Abu-Middayn, said that there are no plans at this stage 
to disarm armed groups such as the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam. 
Speaking to reporter Mark Weiss this morning, Abu-Middayn said 
the main problem is that money and equipment promised to the 
Palestinian police force has still not arrived. 
  [Begin recording] [Abu-Middayn] Well, we are controlling 
very good, I am sure, but you know, communications and 
investors, all these facilities which the donors promised to 
send us -- particularly the Americans -- we did not receive it 
until now. This is a problem for security because we have no 
equipment, no sophisticated equipment for communications. We 
need cars, we need everything. There are a lot of promises, but 
nobody sends anything. This is the real problem for the 
Palestinians, but we are ready, our soldiers are there, our 
policemen are there, and everything is running like a watch. 
  [Weiss] When do you think the Palestinian police will be 
able to stop attacks against Israeli soldiers? 
  [Abu-Middayn] Look, as security will be within one week, it 
will be 100 percent perfect, but as you know, the real challenge 
for the Palestinians is they have not got any money even for 
next week. [sentence as heard] This is the real problem. 
  [Weiss] When do you expect the Palestinian police to move to 
disarm groups such as 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam? 
  [Abu-Middayn] You should ask Mr. 'Arafat or the military 
commanders. I have no answer for this question. 
  [Weiss] So far, there are no plans to move against these 
groups? 
  [Abu-Middayn] No, until now we have no plans. [end
