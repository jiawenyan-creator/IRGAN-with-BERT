MARCHING THROUGH THE CANYON TO PROTEST LAGUNA LAUREL PLAN 
In regard to the Nov. 12 picture and article covering the Laguna Canyon Walk, 
The Times has done another disservice to to Laguna Beach residents. The picture 
with the "class war" placard dead-center is totally misleading in describing 
the canyon walk. 
The article was more accurate in describing the event, but your readers will 
look at the picture and think: There go those lunatics again. 
I am a gray-haired member of the establishment who joined other senior 
citizens, young parents, babies in strollers and bicyclists to make the 
statement that at some point we had had enough of scraped hills with thousands 
of look-alike houses. We want something left in its natural state without man's 
engineering it. 
I live on a street bordering the greenbelt. Whereas we used to see deer 
regularly, raccoon, skunk and an occasional fox, it is now almost a 
neighborhood celebration to see one roadrunner. 
The Irvine Co. does have a right to develop its land, but it also has an 
obligation to preserve the balance of nature. Rearranging hills, producing 
run-off that alters ground water levels are real threats to be considered. Who 
really knows what happens when millions of gallons of water from thousands of 
developed acres percolates through the soil down to the coast? Ultimately 
tinkering with nature produces long-term, far-reaching effects. 
This concern plus all those others that have been addressed in regard to 
pollution, congestion, etc., prompted this writer to say to (developer) Donald 
Bren on Saturday: "Please reassess your plans for Laguna Laurel."
