  [Text] Referring to UN mediator Cyrus Vance's meeting with 
Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, the Foreign Ministry secretary 
general, government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said 
that Greece remains firm on its positions on Skopje. 
  A short while ago, correspondent Dhimitrios Filios reported 
from New York that the talks were suspended, and will resume 
after the European Parliament elections. Filios is on the line: 
  [Filios] About half an hour ago, George Sills, the UN 
secretary general's spokesman, issued a statement at UN 
Headquarters. He distributed a written statement by Vance on 
Skopje that says over the past few days detailed talks with both 
sides were held and views were exchanged. The statement adds 
that the talks were suspended today and will resume in New York 
at foreign ministerial level on or around 13 June. 
  There are two characteristic points of these talks: One, 
that the proposals submitted were discussed by the various 
sides, including Vance and U.S. Presidential Envoy Matthew 
Nimetz. Nimetz participated in all recent talks. 
  The other is the date that the talks will resume at foreign 
ministerial level. Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, not 
Ambassador Zakharakis, will represent Greece, and Skopjean 
Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski will represent Skopje.
