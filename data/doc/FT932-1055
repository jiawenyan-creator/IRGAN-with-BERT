FT  25 JUN 93 / Council chiefs jeer at Banham
SIR JOHN BANHAM, chairman of the Local Government Commission for England,
yesterday warned local authorities against mounting an 'expensive publicly
financed job-preservation exercise'.
He told the annual conference of the Association of District Councils in
Bournemouth that some district councils had spent as much as Pounds 100,000
on lobbyists during the first phases of the commission's reorganisation of
local government.
His comments provoked a hostile response, including jeers and hisses from
councillors and officials. Some delegates called for his resignation.
The association opposes Sir John's recommendations to create large unitary
authorities.
Local authorities in England suffered the loss of 42,000 jobs between March
1992 and March 1993, according to a survey published today by Municipal
Journal.
