  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian 
Democratic Union) has expressed the hope that Germany and Italy 
will work closely together within the framework of the European 
Union [EU], also under the government of new Italian Prime 
Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The task of the two countries is to 
guarantee a common future in Europe, Kohl said in Bonn today. 
  At the start of the short visit by Berlusconi, the 
chancellor 
said that the Italian prime minister has taken over 
responsibility for government at a time of "dramatic changes" in 
Italy as well as throughout Europe. Kohl also recalled that 
Germany and Italy have established stable democracies following 
the collapse of National Socialism and fascism. 
  Berlusconi gave the assurance that his government will 
respect the principles of freedom and tolerance. All forms of 
racism and antisemitism have to stay part of the past. 
Berlusconi pointed out that Italy and Germany currently have 
similar problems, such as unemployment, which they should tackle 
together. The Italian head of government called for a greater 
role for Europe in international relations. In this connection, 
he suggested the establishment of a European `Task Force' which 
should "intervene anywhere in the world where human rights are 
being violated." 
  According to the government, the focus of the concluding 
talks will be the outcome of the European elections and 
preparations for the German presidency of the EU in the second 
half of the year. Berlusconi plans to return to Rome this 
afternoon. 
  Meanwhile, the Central Council of Jews in Germany has called 
on the government to distance itself from the Italian 
Government. on Saarlaendischer Rundfunk, Michel Friedman, 
Presidium member of the Central Council, pointed to the presence 
of neofascist ministers in the new Italian cabinet. Contacts 
with these ministers should be limited to the "absolutely 
essential," Friedman demanded.
