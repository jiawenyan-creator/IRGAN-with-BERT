FT  28 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: New York
The market will open this week with investors in an unsettled mood. After
last week's initially impressive display of fortitude when the Federal
Reserve raised short-term interest rates another quarter of a point to 3.5
per cent, Wall Street had hoped that the worst of the recent sell-off was
over.
Unfortunately, bond prices were unable to build upon the big gains they
earned in the wake of the Fed's move. By Friday, the yield on the benchmark
30-year bond had climbed above 7 per cent for the first time in 10 months as
everyone started worrying about the next Fed tightening.
Over the coming days, trading is likely to be dominated by the March
employment report, which is due to be released on Friday. Just to make
matters worse, Friday is a national holiday, so the cash market will be
closed for the day. Without the opportunity to respond to the employment
data immediately, trading during the first four days of this week is likely
to be jittery.
Analysts are expecting the March jobs report to show an increase in non-farm
payrolls of about 200,000, and they foresee no change in the unemployment
rate, which was last recorded at 6.5 per cent. With market sentiment so
weak, an increase in payrolls substantially larger than 200,000 could prompt
a fresh round of heavy selling.
