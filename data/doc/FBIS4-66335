Experts to Discuss Nation's High-Speed Information Network

  [Summary] A few days ago, MPT held a forum in Beijing on 
``Building China's High-Speed Information Networks.'' At the 
forum, dozens of academicians, professors, senior engineers, and 
high-level managers from the fields of computers, 
communications, and automation offered their proposals on how 
best to implement domestic information highways. Officials from 
MPT's Planning Department and Directorate-General of 
Telecommunications informed the experts of the status and 
development plans for the national communications networks. MPT 
Science and Technology Committee Chairman Song Zhiyuan [1345 
4160 0337] remarked that the people's economic information 
infrastructure for the national network of information highways 
will principally consist of two major components: communications 
platforms in the public sector and applied information systems 
for various authorities.
