CANNES FILM FESTIVAL SALUTING CHANGES IN EAST EUROPE 
The Cannes film festival pays its own political tribute to the triumph of 
democracy in the former Communist Bloc by giving grim East European films 
prominence at next month's event. 
Only one East European director was short-listed last year for the "Golden 
Palm," awarded after 12 days of screenings in the glamorous Riviera resort. 
This time four East European directors will be up for the prize, with another 
two showing outside the competition. 
The sinister aspects of life under the now discredited Communist regimes are 
the focus of most of the East Bloc offerings. 
In Polish director Ryszard Bugajski's "Przesluchanie" (The Interrogation) a 
woman is questioned in a police station, while Czechoslovak director Karel 
Kachyna explores the effect of systematic eavesdropping in "Ucho" (The Ear). 
Polish director Andrzej Wajda, whose "Korzcak" is not up for the award, tells 
the story of a doctor and a group of children struggling to survive in a 
concentration camp in the 1940s. 
Soviet director Pavel Lounguine's cinematic debut -- "Taxi Blues" -- centers on 
the relationship between a cabdriver and an Israeli saxophonist in present-day 
Moscow. 
Festival president Gilles Jacob, who sat on a panel that whittled the 326 films 
originally vying for a place down to 24, stressed that Eastern Europe will not 
be allowed to overshadow other countries' offerings. 
"We took some of the East European films because they are free and liberated 
now, but all parts of the world have been represented," Jacob said. 
Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, fresh from winning an honorary Oscar in Los 
Angeles last month, will open the festival May 10 with his autobiographical 
"Dreams."
