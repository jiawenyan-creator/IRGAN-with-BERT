FT  17 AUG 93 / UN military spokesman asked to leave Sarajevo
A member of Bosnia's presidency, Ejup Ganic, yesterday asked for the removal
of a UN military spokesman in Sarajevo after he repeatedly declined to use
the word 'siege' to describe Bosnian Serb forces' grip on the city, Reuter
reports from Sarajevo.
Commander Barry Frewer, a Canadian who is the press spokesman in Sarajevo
for the UN Protection Force, used the less emotive term 'encirclement' in a
press briefing.
His remarks prompted four relief agencies working in the Bosnian capital to
say conditions remained desperate and accuse the UN of playing politics by
suggesting the siege was over.
