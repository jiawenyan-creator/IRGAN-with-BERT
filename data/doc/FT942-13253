FT  26 APR 94 / Observer: Tall order
Has cookery writer and restaurateur Prue Leith, who once took it upon
herself to uncurl the British Rail sandwich, bitten off more than she can
chew? For last night's annual dinner at the Institute of Chartered
Accountants, she rustled up a dish going by the not very imaginative handle
of Institute Pudding. Any number crunchers expecting nursery food would,
however, have been disappointed, greeted as they were with the distinctly
challenging combination of mascarpone cheese and marmalade. It will now be
dished up as part of the regular fare at Leith's ICA restaurant - not just
to titivate members' appetites, but to help 'sweeten their image' too, she
simpers.
