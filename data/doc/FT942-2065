FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Filofax
Four acquisitions in the last 12 months helped Filofax, the USM-quoted
personal organiser group, lift pre-tax profits by 48 per cent, from Pounds
2.2m to Pounds 3.26m, and total sales by 39 per cent.
Turnover from continuing operations rose from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 17.7m
while acquisitions contributed Pounds 2.37m in the year to March 31. Three
acquisitions, including Swedish and German distributors, helped continental
European sales rise by 84 per cent to Pounds 7m (Pounds 3.8m). UK sales
increased by 30 per cent to Pounds 7m and on a like-for-like basis by 20 per
cent to Pounds 6.5m.
A final dividend of 1p lifts the total to 1.75p (1.25p), payable from
earnings per share of 10.1p (7.7p).
The group ended the year with net cash of Pounds 2.41m (Pounds 3.35m) after
investing Pounds 4.9m in acquisitions.
Mr Robin Field, chief executive, said Filofax looked forward to increased
growth, particularly in continental Europe, where current sales represented
a 'small part of future potential'. He said the group remained alert to
opportunities for further acquisitions.
The UK market for ring binder organisers was growing, he said, and the group
had increased its market share to between 55 and 60 per cent.
The acquisition of Drakes in December had enabled the group to increase its
sales force in the UK. It also provided scope to develop new product lines,
such as the self-stick and carbonless paper products in which Drakes
specialised.
Mr Field said the group had moved to secure its own sales and distribution
networks in Germany and Sweden following the success of its sales subsidiary
in France where turnover had trebled.
He said the Filofax and Drakes brands would be launched in Denmark in the
current year.
