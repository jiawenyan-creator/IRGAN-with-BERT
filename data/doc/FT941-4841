FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Battle for Barrhead in unusual twist
The battle for Barrhead Sanitary Ware, the Scottish workers co-operative,
took an unusual turn when one class of shareholder failed to achieve the
necessary threshold to approve one of the offers for the bathroom products
group.
It is thought there may be a danger that the other offer may also fail to
meet the threshold set down in Barrhead's articles, leaving the company in
danger of going into receivership.
An extraordinary general meeting was called to consider the offer from Baxi
Partnership, an employee-owned heating engineering company based in Preston,
Lanca- shire.
The meetings of the ordinary voting and preference shareholders agreed
unanimously to let the Baxi offer proceed but the ordinary non-voting
received the support of only 61 per cent against a threshold of 75 per cent.
The votes came despite the Barrhead board switching their support from Baxi
to Shires, a Bradford-based bathroom products group. The board now fears
this offer may not proceed under the present articles.
If both offers fail Baxi has offered to make a secured loan of Pounds
450,000 available to keep the company going and has proposals for
strengthening the Barrhead board. In the event of reaching agreement on the
Baxi proposals the Barrhead board intends simplifying its constitution.
Barrhead was formed in April 1992 by former workers of Armitage Shanks
following the closure of its works at Barrhead near Paisley.
