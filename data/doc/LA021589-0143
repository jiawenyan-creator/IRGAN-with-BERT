METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
 HILL STREET SECTION OPEN THIS WEEK 
The Times reported incorrectly Tuesday that a stretch of Hill Street in 
downtown Los Angeles, closed two weeks ago to shore up a Metro Rail tunnel, 
would not reopen until next week. 
In fact, the road was reopened to traffic on Monday, according to Greg Davy, a 
spokesman for the Southern California Rapid Transit District. 
The segment was shut after construction engineers found unexpected stress on 
the struts that support a 1,000-foot section of Hill Street above the tunnel 
between Temple and 1st streets. Several horizontal steel struts were added to 
the 80-foot-deep tunnel.
