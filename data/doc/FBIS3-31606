  [Text] [Announcer] Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia -- FYROM] Foreign Relations Minister Branko 
Crvenkovski returned to Skopje today from a two-day official 
visit to the Republic of Albania. Albania's support for 
Macedonia's integrity and stability, and its offer to help our 
country in matters of transport and communications, and in 
alleviating the effects of the Greek blockade were the most 
important results of the visit to Tirana. 
  [Begin Crvenkovski recording] The Albanian side reiterated 
its support for the independence and territorial integrity of 
the Republic of Macedonia. We expressed our readiness for 
developing cooperation and for pursuing a policy of peace, 
good-neighborly relations, and non-interference in each other's 
internal affairs. We also discussed economic ties, especially 
projects related to the East-West corridor. The Albanian side 
has already condemned Greece's unilateral attack against the 
Republic of Macedonia and they offered us, within their means, 
the use of their transportation system and port facilities for 
the transport of Macedonia's goods. [end recording]
