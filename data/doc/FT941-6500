FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Malaysia Airlines share sale to
MHS approved
Shareholders in Malaysia Airlines (MAS), the country's partially-privatised
flag carrier, have agreed to changes in its charter allowing a large stake
in the company to be sold to Malaysian Helicopter Services (MHS), at present
a company dealing mainly in support services for the Malaysian oil and gas
industry.
The way is now clear for MHS to take up a 32 per cent stake in MAS bought
late last year from Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank, for MDollars
1.79bn (USDollars 656.5m). MHS says it intends to fund the purchase by a
public offering of new MHS shares.
MHS is a relatively small company controlled by Mr Tajudin Ramli, a close
business associate of Mr Daim Zainuddin, the former Malaysian finance
minister reputed to be one of Malaysia's most influential business people.
In recent months MHS has been on an aggressive acquisition hunt. It now has
substantial stakes in a Malaysian shipping line, 25 per cent of World
Airways, the US cargo and passenger charter company, and 18 per cent of
Pelangi Air, a small Malaysian airline.
