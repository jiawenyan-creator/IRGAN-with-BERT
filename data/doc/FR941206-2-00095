 

Obtaining Further Employment Authorization




With Salvadoran DED ending, 

ABC

 class members may obtain further employment authorization based on a ``pending'' asylum application. Special procedures
apply to class members who seek work authorization under the agreement. Class members seeking employment authorization
must identify themselves as 

ABC

 class members. They must have an asylum application on file or must file a completed asylum application (Form I589)
with Form I765, Application for Employment Authorization. Eligible class members who apply for employment
authorization under this agreement are not subject to the ``non-frivolous'' standard required under 8 CFR 208.7(a).
Form I765, with or without an asylum application as appropriate, must be filed directly with the service center
having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence for asylum-related applications. However, if the original
asylum application was filed with an immigration judge in exclusion or deportation proceedings, applications for
employment authorization and asylum should be filed at the appropriate local INS office until directed otherwise.

Class members generally must pay the employment authorization application fee, currently seventy dollars ($70).
However, when an 

initial

 application for employment authorization is filed based on an asylum application which is found to satisfy the non-frivolous
test, such an initial employment authorization application can be filed and approved without payment of the filing
fee under the general asylum regulations now in effect. Also, eligible class members who can demonstrate that they
fall within the poverty guidelines at 45 CFR 1060.2 will not be required to pay the fee.

In summary, new asylum applications are 

required

 only from those who have 

never

 filed for asylum before. All other class members may choose to rely on any asylum application filed previously. Class
members may supplement a previously filed or newly filed asylum officer. Applicants who must have continuous documentation
of employment authorization should apply as early as possible with the appropriate service center or local office.
It is not necessary to wait until the planned 

ABC

 notices are sent or until the class member's individual 

ABC

 notice is received. Such an application for employment authorization must be based on an asylum application.
