BRIEFLY 
Drexel to Replace Cash with Paper: Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. plans to require 
employees making over $200,000 in total compensation this year to take an 
as-yet-undetermined percentage of their year-end bonuses in the form of 
convertible preferred securities instead of cash. The plan, which is expected 
to affect fewer than 1,000 employees, is part of an effort to boost the firm's 
capital by several million dollars.
