FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: US store in Japan venture
FORGET the Japanese encroachment into baseball and Hollywood. L. L. Bean,
the quintessentially US sporting goods group, yesterday signed an agreement
with two Japanese companies, which will establish a chain of stores selling
L. L Bean goods in Japan.
L. L Bean, a privately owned company based in Freeport, Maine, said the
first store would open in Tokyo, this autumn. The plan then envisages
establishing five stores within five years.
The two Japanese partners, who have set up the L. L. Bean Japan
joint-venture company, are Seiyu, a large Japanese supermarket chain and
part of the Saison group, and Matsushita Electric Company, whose brand names
range from Panasonic to Technics and which recently acquired the US
entertainment group, MCA.
They will run the retail operation in Japan, with L. L. Bean supplying the
vast bulk of the stock. L. L. Bean will also provide training for the
Japanese sales staff.
Speculation that L. L. Bean goods could be sold through Japanese retail
outlets has circulated for some time, and yesterday L. L. Bean said it was
approached by the Japanese a year and a half ago.
