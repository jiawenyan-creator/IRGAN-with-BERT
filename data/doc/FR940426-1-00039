Unfair Trade Practices Under the Federal Alcohol Administration 
Act (93F003P) 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), 
Department of the Treasury.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 ATF is proposing to amend trade practice regulations 
under the Federal Alcohol Administration (FAA) Act on 
tied-house, exclusive outlets, commercial bribery, and 
consignment sales by adding standards for enforcing the 
``exclusion'' element where appropriate and by revising other 
regulations as the result of an agency review and an industry 
petition. Under the FAA Act, ``exclusion, in whole or in part, 
of distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages, sold or offered 
for sale by other persons'' is a necessary element of a 
violation of the tied-house, exclusive outlets or commercial 
bribery provisions. Recent court rulings have raised questions 
concerning ATF's traditional interpretation of the term 
``exclusion''. ATF intends to use rulemaking to 
(1) promulgate a framework for establishing ``exclusion,'' (2) identify promotional practices which result in
retailer 
control, (3) identify promotional practices which result in 
exclusion under the Act, and (4) identify those practices for 
which there is no likelihood that exclusion will result and for 
which the Bureau will not take action (safe harbors). Other 
regulatory amendments are also made as a result of an ATF 
review of the regulations and an industry petition submitted in 
1992.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
The Federal Alcohol Administration Act 


The Federal Alcohol Administration Act (hereinafter 
referred to as FAA Act or Act) provides for Federal regulation of the alcoholic beverage industry. The FAA Act contains

particular restrictions that are unique to the alcoholic 
beverage industry and reflects Congress' concern with a variety 
of trade practices and abuses that took place before, during 
and immediately after Prohibition. This notice of proposed 
rulemaking focuses on four parts of the statute, Exclusive 
Outlet (27 U.S.C. 205(a)), Tied-House (27 U.S.C. 
205(b)), Commercial Bribery (27 U.S.C. 205(c)), and Consignment 
Sales (27 U.S.C. 205(d)). The supplementary information is 
divided into two sections. The first section deals with the 
subject of exclusion, and the second section covers other 
changes proposed as a result of an internal review of trade 
practice regulations and an industry petition.


Exclusion 


One element which is necessary for these practices to 
result in violation of Federal law is ``exclusion, in whole or 
in part, of distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages, sold or 
offered for sale by other persons.'' 
Although exclusion is not defined in the FAA Act or in the 
current implementing regulations at 27 CFR parts 6, 8 and 10, 
ATF has, in the past, held that ``exclusion in part'' includes 
causing retailers to purchase less of a competing brand than 
they otherwise would have bought. 
In a recent decision, however, 

Fedway Associates, Inc., et 
al. 

v. 

United States Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (Fedway),

 976 F.2d 1416 (DC Cir. 1992) the United 
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, 
held that Congress had intended something more than just a 
retailer purchasing less of a competing brand than it otherwise 
would have and for a violation to occur there must also be a 
tie or link between a supplier and retailer that at least 
threatens the retailer's independence. 
The court based this conclusion on several points. The 
court said ``exclusion'' means to exclude a rival product from 
the marketplace by some direct action of the violator. Merely 
taking some action which influences a retailer not to purchase 
a rival product is not exclusion under the Act if the 
retailer's response is the result of a free economic choice. 
This interpretation of exclusion as meaning the shutting out or 
expelling of a rival's product, according to the court, is 
consistent with conduct addressed by the Act such as 
tied-house, commercial bribery and exclusive outlets. Any 
broader interpretation would, in the view of the court, likely 
result in restriction of pro-competitive activities.
