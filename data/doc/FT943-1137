FT  26 SEP 94 / People (Names in the News): Problems at home and away
Lars Thunell became one of Sweden's best travelled businessmen last year as
he scuttled round the world sorting out the problems left by the crisis at
Nordbanken, writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
His new job as chief executive of Trygg-Hansa, one of the country's two main
insurers, will also give him opportunities for international troubleshooting
 -starting in the US where Trygg has run into deep problems with its Home
insurance affiliate.
Trygg has suffered big losses through its 64.5 per cent stake in Home, a
much bigger company, and it is anxious to reduce the burden by bringing in a
partner as soon as possible. Resolving this difficulty is probably Thunell's
top priority, although his wider task will be to restore Trygg's tarnished
reputation after the crisis in the Swedish financial sector.
Thunell, 46, is widely admired for his work at Securum, the 'bad bank'
loaded with Nordbanken's problem loans. He made it more than a pure
liquidating company by giving it an active role in maximising value. His
finest hour came last year when he played a vital part in engineering the
SKr16.6bn merger between Nobel Industries - in which Securum held 72.9 per
cent - and the Dutch chemicals group Akzo.
Not surprisingly, then, his new appointment was welcomed by the market,
which marked Trygg's shares higher. Whether it goes down as well with
Trygg's employees is another matter.
'I am good at changes, both at building up and cutting down,' said Thunell
with a slight hint of menace when he met the press last week. He also
suggested that the group should stick to what it does best - keeping its
domestic insurance customers satisfied.
