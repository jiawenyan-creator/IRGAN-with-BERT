  [Text] Zakho, Iraq, March 27, (AFP) -- Two Austrian UN 
guards were wounded, one of them seriously, when gunmen ambushed 
a bus they were travelling in Sunday [27 March] near Irbil in 
Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, UN sources said. 
  The United Nations was trying to evacuate the wounded 
guards, 
said the officials in Zakho near the Turkish border. 
  The Austrians were in a bus taking 22 UN guards from Irbil 
to 
Baghdad at the end of their tour of duty. The guards are 
employed to protect UN personnel and vehicles. 
  UN organisations have been working in the Kurdish-controlled 
region of northern Iraq since the Kurdish uprising against 
Baghdad which followed the January-February 1991 Gulf war. 
  Since 1992 UN personnel and offices in the region have been 
repeatedly attacked. 
  The Kurdish authorities blamed agents of the Iraqi 
government. 
  Baghdad has warned several times that it will not tolerate 
foreigners carrying out humanitarian work in the north of the 
country. 
  There have been 11 attacks this year, nine against the UN, 
one against a German humanitarian organisation and one against 
Swedish journalists, the UN's Inter-Agency Relief Coordination 
Unit reported. It said six people were injured but none killed.
