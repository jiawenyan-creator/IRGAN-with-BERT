FT  25 APR 91 / EC Council settles row over research
THE EC Council of Ministers yesterday settled a institutional row with other
Community bodies and approved Ecu3.83bn (Pounds 2.62bn) for ten research
projects over the next two and a half years.
The row, which threatened further to delay the EC's already tardy framework
programme for 1990-94, was a by-product of the sparring between EC
institutions in the negotiations on political union.
The Council had earlier changed five programmes - on marine and life
sciences, the environment, communications and electronic data transmission -
to the extent that the parliament persuaded the Commission to withdraw them
altogether. Pulling these programmes off the table and then resubmitting
would have delayed them months.
So,in the end, the EC executive and parliament settled for a few vague and
minor changes, such as promises to weigh the socio-economic impact of EC
research, which were adopted by EC ministers yesterday and are expected to
win parliamentary approval next month.
In addition to these five programmes, ministers also reached basic political
agreement on information technology (worth Ecu1.33bn alone), medical
research, industrial materials, and non-nuclear energy and the
agro-industrial programme.
