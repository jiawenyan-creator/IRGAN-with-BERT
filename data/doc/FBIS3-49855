  [Excerpt] Geneva, 19 Jan (TANJUG) -- The Bosnian peace 
talks resumed this morning in Geneva in an atmosphere of 
complete uncertainty and evident pessimism. As expected, the 
negotiations resumed with bilateral talks between the 
delegations of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia. 
  It has been learned from well-informed sources that in 
addition to debating the resolution of the Bosnian conflict 
there will also be discussions at the negotiating table about 
the normalization of Serbo-Croat relations. It has also been 
learned that this time -- in these talks on normalization -- 
things could go significantly further than intimated earlier.
