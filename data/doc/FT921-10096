FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: IBM explores Solectron link
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines is in talks with Solectron, a California
electronics manufacturing and assembly contractor, about forming a long-term
partnership covering the assembly of computer circuit boards.
Such a deal would provide IBM with contract circuit-board assembly services
in the US and France.
The move is in line with IBM's strategy to focus its operations upon areas
to which it brings special expertise while sub-contracting other functions
to third parties.
Solectron would gain access to certain IBM technologies and processes, the
companies said.
IBM would become a minority shareholder in Solectron, and Solectron would
acquire an IBM production site in Canejan, Bordeaux, France, and a building
with an assembly operation in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Financial details were not disclosed. The companies said they aimed to
complete contracts later this year.
