  [Text] Well, what is one supposed to say? Bill Clinton 
sits down at one table with Italian fascists. The U.S. 
President talks with Rome government members who would like to 
be grandsons of Mussolini. Perhaps one should also call them 
the Berchtesgaden group of Berlusconi's cabinet. These people 
can be partners in a talk for the Democrat from Washington? 
  In Germany we have ambiguous experiences with such and 
similar situations. They are bad experiences, as far as the 
attempt to punish objectionable partners in international 
politics by denying diplomatic or other visits and contacts to 
them is concerned. This did not work, to say the most harmless 
thing about it. However, the experiences with the effect of 
international normality in the dealings between the National 
Socialists and foreign statesmen that Hitler's opponents had to 
make at home were even worse. Many warnings fell flat, resolute 
persons lost courage when they saw how honor was paid to someone 
to whom it was not due. Here logic does not mean anything. The 
same people who would have wildly abused Kohl if Honecker had 
not been suitably received in Bonn are criticizing him today 
because he did so. 
  However, such ambiguousness has to be endured. These are the 
costs of the possession of power. By the way, Clinton also 
visited a U.S. military cemetery and recalled the United States' 
war against the fascists, which gave freedom back to the 
country. That is right.
