FT  26 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo
Japanese government bonds were supported last week by the weakness in the
stock market and were little affected by the turmoil on the US bond market.
Bond prices also failed to react to the government's tax package announced
later in the week, since much of the detail was floated in the press before
hand.
But while last week's second-quarter GDP figures confirmed the expected
slack recovery process, investors have yet to start their trading for the
second half and are expected to remain sidelined this week.
Money market rates also reflect caution over a possible rise in interest
rates. Euroyen futures markets currently indicate that short-term money
market rates will rise from the current level of 2.3 per cent to 2.5 per
cent by the year-end and over 3 per cent by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, bond market participants will focus on the spate of economic
indicators released this week. August industrial output figures to be
announced this Thursday are expected to rise due to the hot summer and high
electricity demand, hence being negative for the bond market.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo expects production to have risen by 2 per
cent in August from a month earlier and a 1.8 per cent year-on-year rise,
the strongest since July 1991.
