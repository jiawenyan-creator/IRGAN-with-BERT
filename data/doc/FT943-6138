FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Israel Fund assets fall
Net assets per share of the Israel Fund fell by 12.5 per cent to 83.54 cents
(54p) between the trust's launch on March 17 and July 31 this year.
Mr Michael Connors, manager of the trust at BZW Investment Management, said
the results reflected a difficult year so far for the Israeli stock market.
It has been hit by inflation worries, interest rate rises, the proposed
imposition of a capital gains tax, and concerns over progress in the Middle
East peace process.
When the Israel Fund was launched, the main Tel Aviv index stood at 208. By
May it had risen to a high of 229, but subsequently dropped to 149, and has
since recovered to about 184. Over the period March 17 to July 31, the
Mishtanim index fell by 14.1 per cent in dollar terms.
The trust, which is the first UK-listed investment trust to concentrate on
Israel, raised about Dollars 153m. Some two thirds is now invested, 80 per
cent of which is in companies listed on the Tel Aviv stock exchange, with
the remainder in Israeli companies listed on US stock exchanges.
Earnings were 0.19 cents.
