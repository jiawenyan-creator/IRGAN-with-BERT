<H5>  WHEN THE NATS GET INTO BED WITH THE ANC, GUESS WHAT HAPPENS </H5>
TO YOU? 
  We know what you're thinking. The "new" Nats [National Party 
members] would never get into bed with the ANC, right? 
  Wrong. Because if you read on, you'll see that the Nats have 
already become the ANC's junior partners. 
  After the rioting in Johannesburg two weeks ago, FW de 
Klerk's government gave in to an outrageous ANC request not to 
search their headquarters. (This means the people who shot 
protesters, or perhaps innocent bystanders, from this building 
may never be identified.) 
  In the past few months the NP and ANC also agreed to keep 
Detention without Trail. 
  And their deals go back even further than this. 
  At negotiations last year, the Nats even caved in on the 
issue of Federalism, so we're now faced with a possible civil 
war. 
  These examples all show one thing: you can't trust FW and 
his 
"new" Nats to be an effective opposition. 
  Make no mistake, if you want your rights and interests to be 
protected after the election, you'll need a party that will 
stand up to the ANC, not give in to them. 
  So vote for the Democratic Party. 
  Then when the ANC and the Nats get into bed together, you 
won't have to take it lying down."
