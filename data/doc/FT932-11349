FT  05 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Ukraine wants Russia to pay world prices
THE Ukrainian government is preparing a decree which would shift trade with
Russia to world prices on July 1, according to Ukrainian officials. If
implemented, the measure would bring a sharp shock to Ukraine's already
faltering economy, but in the long term it would be likely to assist market
reforms in the two neighbouring Slav states.
Mr Ivan Herts, Ukrainian minister for foreign economic relations, said he
had prepared a decree that would oblige Russia to pay world prices for goods
and services, including the transit costs of oil and gas, which it exports
through Ukraine. In exchange, Mr Herts expects Russia to raise the prices it
charges Ukraine for energy to international rates.
The decree will be debated by cabinet on May 10.
