FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: 'Skill shortages' fuelled steep
1980s pay rises
SKILL shortages caused the rapid increase in pay during the tight labour
market of the late 1980s, not successful union bargaining, according to the
economic department of the Trades Union Congress.
Mr Bill Callaghan, head of the department, said yesterday at a pay seminar
organised by the Employment Policy Institute: 'Pay premia for scarce skilled
workers reflected a failure to train rather than a success of union
bargaining.'
Mr Callaghan said decentralisation of bargaining may have benefited unions
in the short term but initiatives were still needed to allow unions and
employers to take a longer-term view on pay.
'The collective bargaining outcomes of the past decade have not been ones
that the unions would find acceptable,' he said. Those who have received the
largest pay increases have not been union members, he added.
Mr Callaghan did not rule out a return to an incomes policy in 1994 or 1995
as an alternative to higher interest rates or big cuts in public spending.
He said the government had already 'crossed the Rubicon' with its public
sector pay policy.
Pay restraint in the private and public sectors should make unions
concentrate on employment protection and creation and on the improvement of
training and equal opportunities, he said. 'In the public sector there may
be scope for a co-ordinated approach on employment stability as the number
one bargaining objective.'
