  [Text] President 'Arafat received another letter from the 
Russian leadership yesterday evening. The letter was handed to 
him by the Russian ambassador in Tunis, with whom he discussed 
the latest developments and the current consultations aimed at 
speeding up the adoption of the UN Security Council draft 
resolution which has been outstanding for over 19 days. This 
draft resolution calls for the condemnation of the Hebron 
massacre, the provision of international protection for the 
Palestinian people, the disarming of settlers, and the 
introduction of the necessary arrangements to protect the 
Palestinian people in the occupied territories, particularly in 
Hebron.
