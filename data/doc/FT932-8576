FT  18 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Lesser to retire as
vice-chairman of Bankers Trust
BANKERS Trust, the New York banking and securities trading group, announced
yesterday that its vice-chairman, Mr Edward Lesser, will retire at the end
of the year. His departure follows the restructuring of the division he led
for the best part of a decade.
Under the restructuring, the business focus of the cash management,
securities processing and investment management operations (known
collectively as Profitco) run by Mr Lesser was reoriented towards customer,
not product, groupings. Originally, the reorganisation involved setting up
seven client groups, under the new name of Global Assets.
That reorganisation, however, ran into early problems. The number of
customer groups was reduced to five, a move which led to the departure of
two managing directors, from the private banking and information services
areas. Then yesterday, Bankers Trust announced that the Global Assets and
the investment management groups would be consolidated with the funds
management division, into a new group called Global Investment Management.
Although Mr Lesser remained in charge of the division following its initial
restructuring, the changes led to speculation that he would step down from
the company.
Mr Lesser, 59, joined Bankers Trust in 1955. In 1984 he helped form Profitco
and was credited with the idea of turning the custodial and
information-processing businesses of the bank into profit centres in their
own right.
