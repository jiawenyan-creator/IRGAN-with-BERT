  [Text] Vilnius, June 17 (XINHUA) -- Lithuanian Prime 
Minister Adolfas Slezevicius said today that the forthcoming 
visit to lithuania by Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen is 
expected to further enhance economic cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  Slezevicius told XINHUA in an exclusive interview that 
Lithuania attaches great importance to developing ties with 
China as there exist great potentials for economic cooperation 
between the two countries. 
  Reviewing the development of the Lithuania-China relations 
in 
recent years, he said Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas's 
successful visit to China last year strongly pushed forward the 
bilateral relations.

said, "Lithuania is now enjoying a stable political situation 
and its economy is turning for the better although we still face 
a lot of problems." 
  He stressed that the inflation rate in Lithuania has been 
brought under control and has now dropped to 23 percent from 189 
percent in March 1993, when the current government took office. 
  He also urged businessmen from east and west, including 
those 
from China, to invest in Lithuania.
