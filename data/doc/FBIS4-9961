  [Text] Jose Maria Monterrey, director of the National 
Civilian Police [PNC], reported that the U.S. officer who died 
after detonating a hand grenade that also wounded two members of 
the PNC, was under the influence of drugs. Monterrey added that 
the accident, which occurred at the PNC station in the Zacamil 
neighborhood, occurred after the officer threatened to try and 
reclaim the confiscated weapons. 
  [Begin recording] [Monterrey] They say that they arrived at 
the station after arresting the bodyguards of Colonel Rivera for 
drunken misconduct. They were firing their weapons, I believe, 
so they were arrested. They were taken to the police station. 
They said they were U.S. Embassy personnel, so we called the 
U.S. Embassy, after which the colonel arrived. We turned over 
the hand grenade and the weapons that had been confiscated from 
the two detained bodyguards. He then began to handle the 
grenade. At first they thought it was an accident. That was 
later ruled out because of the high amount of drugs involved. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The U.S. Embassy report says he 
thought it was a toy. [Words indistinct] could it be, given the 
state he was in because of the drugs, that he might have used 
the grenade to threaten those present? 
  [Monterrey] Apparently he was a little arrogant when he 
arrived. There was some of that with our people. You must 
remember that they always try to look down on our people. 
However, there is no doubt that this was caused by an excessive 
amount of drugs. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] 
  [Monterrey] We are going to try and make this the highest 
amount they have ever paid in compensation. One of the boys is 
blind, and the other will lose one eye. 
  [Reporter] Are these the only wounded? 
  [Monterrey] Just these two policemen were wounded. 
Fortunately all the others fled when they saw him playing with 
the grenade in his condition. [end recording] 
  The PNC director added that they will ask for the highest 
possible compensation for the wounded policemen. It was 
reported that Col. Julio Ramon Rivera, who died in the incident, 
was a security officer at the U.S. Embassy in our country.
