FT  05 SEP 92 / Swan wins order for Tyne ferry
SWAN HUNTER, the Tyneside shipbuilder, announced yesterday that it had won
an order worth almost Pounds 1.4m for a new cross-Tyne ferry.
The 200-tonne vessel's size is very modest by warship builders' standards,
but Swan's success in clinching the contract signals the company's entry
into the small ships market, where it hopes to win further work.
Swan Hunter Engineering, part of the Wallsend-based group, overcame stiff
competition from six UK yards and one in Germany. It will be the smallest
vessel to be built by the company since privatisation it was privatised in
1986.
The new Tyne ferry will be among the first to incorporate new safety
measures developed by the Department of Transport following the sinking of
the Marchioness on the River Thames in London in 1989, in which 51 people
died.
The contract, placed by the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive,
will provide work for 40 men for eight months. Work starts next month. It
will not stave off job losses at Swan Hunter.
