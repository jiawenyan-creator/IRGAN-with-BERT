 

Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking


Pursuant to section 553(b)(3)(B) of title 5 of the U.S. Code, I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice
of rulemaking because these interim regulations will result in immediate cost savings without adversely affecting
FEHB enrollees.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they primarily affect individuals enrolled under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.


List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 890

(b) If the annuitant elects to pay premiums directly, he or she must send to the employing office his or her share of the
subscription charge for the enrollment for every pay period during which the enrollment continues, exclusive of
the 31-day temporary extension of coverage for conversion provided in 890.401. The annuitant must pay after
each pay period he or she is covered in accordance with a schedule established by the employing office. If the employing
office does not receive payment by the date due, the employing office must notify the annuitant in writing that continuation
of coverage depends upon payment being made within 15 days (45 days for annuitants residing overseas) after receipt
of the notice. If no further payments are made, the employing office terminates the enrollment 60 days after the date
of the notice (90 days for annuitants residing overseas). The employing office automatically reinstates enrollment
on a prospective basis when payment of annuity or compensation resumes.
