FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Densitron returns to profit and dividends
Densitron International, the electronic components maker, returned to
profits in the first half of 1992 and is rejoining to the dividend list with
an interim of 0.4p.
The improved figures resulted from strong sales into Asia by the Japanese
company and sharply reduced costs in Europe and the US, the company said.
On turnover lower at Pounds 23.4m (Pounds 24.5m) pre-tax profits were Pounds
370,000, against Pounds 401,000. There was a loss for the 1991 year of
Pounds 377,000. Earnings per share were 0.8p (0.56p).
