FT  22 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Chinese firm applies to join
US exchanges
CHINA International Futures Corp, a Beijing-based commodities trading
consortium, has become the first Chinese company to apply for membership at
three of the largest US futures exchanges.
Mr Hang Chang, Cifco's representative in the US, said the company would also
like a presence on the London Metals Exchange, although no application has
been made.
Cifco is seeking membership at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago
Board of Trade and New York's Commodity Exchange.
Mr Chang said the company had not decided whether it would purchase seats
outright on the US exchanges, or lease them from other members.
Cifco was formed a year ago by 12 state-owned commodities and materials
companies in China, including the China Grain Trading Co and the China
Material Trading Co.
It operates under the auspices of the Chinese Ministry of Domestic Trade.
Its president, Mr Lu Jian, is an Oxford-trained economist, and its chairman,
Mr Tian Yuan, was educated in China and the US.
Mr Chang joined the company this year after spending five years as an
economist at the Chicago Board of Trade.
With China's economy expanding rapidly, Cifco dominates China's plethora of
small domestic exchanges, and actively trades futures in US, London, Japan,
Singapore and Hong Kong.
Cifco has 2,000 employees and operates 18 subsidiaries and branch offices in
China's commercial centres, including Shanghai and Nanking.
