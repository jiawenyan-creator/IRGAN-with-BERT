FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Lenders lower rates
With the Budget out of the way, most lenders felt safe emerging from purdah
this week, after the half percentage point cut on November 23, to announce
changes to their mortgage and savings rates.
Halifax, the largest lender, said on Tuesday that it was reducing its
standard variable mortgage rate for new borrowers, by 0.35 of a point to
7.64 per cent, its lowest for 25 years. The new rate comes into effect for
existing borrowers from January 1. The reduction means a drop in payments of
Pounds 11.75 a month for a Pounds 60,000 repayment mortgage.
The new mortgage rate undercut Nationwide, National &amp; Provincial, National
Westminster and Lloyds banks which had all lowered their rates by 0.25 of a
point to 7.74 per cent soon after the base rate reduction.
N &amp; P subsequently reduced its rate to match Halifax. There are now two main
mortgage rate camps: those following Halifax with a standard variable rate
of 7.64 per cent which include Alliance &amp; Leicester, Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester, TSB, N &amp; P and Derbyshire, and those following Nationwide with
7.74 per cent. These are Abbey National, Leeds Permanent, Lloyds, NatWest
and Midland Bank.
Savers dependent on deposits face a further erosion in income. Institutions
are following their usual policy of making their savers feel the pain of
falling interest rates well before their borrowers who have to wait, for the
most part, until January before they benefit from the drop in mortgage
rates. Moreover, savings rates are cut more deeply than mortgage rates.
Royal Bank of Scotland, for example, is passing on the full 0.5 point
reduction to borrowers, taking its mortgage rate to 7.49 per cent but it has
also reduced interest on Royal Reward, its 90-day bonus account, by up to
0.9 of a percentage point off the gross rate on most bands. Someone in the
Pounds 10,000-Pounds 24,999 band receives 4.3 per cent gross (with a 2 per
cent bonus if no withdrawals are made in a year).
Leeds Permanent has reduced gross rates on its Liquid Gold instant access
account and Solid Gold, three month notice account by a more modest 0.35 of
a point across most bands. The gross rate on a deposit in Liquid Gold
between Pounds 10,000-Pounds 24,999 is 4.7 gross (3.53 net). It is 5.4 per
cent gross (4.05 net) in the same band in the Solid Gold account.
Britannia building society has cut its mortgage rate from 7.99 per cent to
7.75 per cent and reduced savings rates mostly by 0.5 of a percentage point.
Alliance &amp; Leicester has reduced its Bonus 90 savings account by between
0.25 and 0.4 of a point while Nationwide has cut most of its savings rates
by 0.5 of a point. C &amp; G's London Share postal account now pays 6.05 per
cent gross (4.54 net), down from 6.25 gross and C &amp; G has also cut almost
all its other savings accounts.
Lower interest rates have spawned a batch of fixed mortgage rates (all have
early redemption penalties). NatWest's new rates are 6.25 per cent until
January 31 1996, 7.25 per cent to January 31 1999 and 7.95 per cent to
January 31 2004. The arrangement fee is Pounds 250 and there are no
insurance tie-ins.
Nationwide's new five-year fix is at 7.25 per cent. The valuation is free
and the fee of Pounds 250 is refundable on completion. C &amp; G's five-year fix
at 6.99 per cent, launched last month, is still available for an application
fee of Pounds 250. TSB is offering a capped rate of 7.25 per cent until
February 28 1999 in addition to its existing cap of 6.75 per cent until
February 28 1997. Arrangement fees are Pounds 250 and Pounds 195
respectively. The society's buildings and contents insurance has to be taken
out.
Alliance &amp; Leicester's new range is from 5.45 per cent on a one year fix to
7.4 per cent for five years. The arrangement fee is 0.5 per cent of the loan
up to a maximum of Pounds 300 and borrowers must take out buildings and
contents insurance through the society.
