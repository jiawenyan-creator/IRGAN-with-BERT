  [Text] People allegedly linked to the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] today attacked the 
Malongo oil complex, 30 km north of the city of Cabinda, 
according to an unofficial military source in Luanda. The 
source added that the staff at the complex, run by the American 
company Chevron, were evacuated to the sea, from where they 
contacted their relatives in Luanda by phone. Without giving 
any more details, the source said this was the first military 
incident in Cabinda involving a foreign company. The Malongo 
complex is the most important in the country, accounting for 60 
percent of the oil exploration in Angola. According to the 
source the attack took place in mid-morning. The staff were 
evacuated to the high sea and no one was killed. Despite 
various attempts, it has been impossible to get confirmation of 
this attack from the Chevron offices in Luanda or in Cabinda, as 
they are closed. 
  In the meantime, the same source also said that UNITA and 
the 
Angolan Armed Forces have been fighting in Malanje.
