1.642(c)6 

Valuation of a remainder interest in property 
transferred to a pooled income fund after April 30, 1989. 


(a) 

In general.

 (1) For purposes of sections 170, 2055, 
2106, and 2522, the fair market value of a remainder interest in 
property transferred to a pooled income fund is its present value 
determined under paragraph (d) of this section. 
(2) The present value of a remainder interest at the time of 
the transfer of property to the pooled income fund is determined 
by computing the present value (at the time of the transfer) of 
the life income interest and subtracting that value from the fair 
market value of the transferred property on the valuation date. 
The fact that the income beneficiary may not receive the last 
income payment, as provided in paragraph (b)(7) of 1.642(c)5, 
is not taken into account for purposes of determining the value 
of the life income interest. For purposes of this section, the 
valuation date is the date on which property is transferred to 
the fund by the donor except that, for purposes of section 2055 
or 2106, it is the alternate valuation date, if elected, under 
the provisions and limitations set forth in section 2032 and the 
regulations thereunder. 
(3) Any claim for a deduction on any return for the value of 
the remainder interest in property transferred to a pooled income 
fund must be supported by a statement attached to the return 
showing the computation of the present value of the interest. 
(b) 

Actuarial computations by the Internal Revenue Service. 


The regulations in this and in related sections provide tables of 
actuarial factors and examples that illustrate the use of the 
tables in determining the value of remainder interests in 
property. Section 1.75201(c)(2) refers to government 
publications that provide additional tables of factors and 
examples of computations for more complex situations. If the 
computation requires the use of a factor that is not provided in 
this section, the Commissioner may supply the factor upon a 
request for a ruling. A request for a ruling must be accompanied 
by a recitation of the facts including the pooled income fund's 
highest yearly rate of return for the 3 taxable years immediately 
preceding the date of transfer, the date of birth of each 
measuring life, and copies of the relevant documents. A request 
for a ruling must comply with the instructions for requesting a 
ruling published periodically in the Internal Revenue Bulletin 
(see 601.201 and 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter) and 
include payment of the required user fee. If the Commissioner 
furnishes the factor, a copy of the letter supplying the factor 
should be attached to the tax return in which the deduction is 
claimed. If the Commissioner does not furnish the factor, the 
taxpayer must furnish a factor computed in accordance with the 
principles set forth in this section. 
(c) 

Computation of pooled income fund's yearly rate of 
return.

 (1) For purposes of determining the present value of the 
life income interest, the yearly rate of return earned by a 
pooled income fund for a taxable year is the percentage obtained 
by dividing the amount of income earned by the pooled income fund 
for the taxable year by an amount equal to_
(i) The average fair market value of the property in such 
fund for that taxable year; less 
(ii) The corrective term adjustment.

in property transferred to a pooled income fund after April 30,
