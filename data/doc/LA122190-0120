BRIEFLY 
Flying Howitzer Makes First Flight: The Rockwell International AC-130U gunship 
made its flight from the firm's Palmdale facilities, landing after a 2 1/2-hour 
flight at Edwards Air Force Base. 
It is the first of 12 of the gunships that Rockwell will deliver to the Air 
Force under a 1987 contract. It carries a 105-millimeter howitzer, intended to 
blast ground targets from the sky. The gunship is a modified C-130 transport 
jet, built by Lockheed.
