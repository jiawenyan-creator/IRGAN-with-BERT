BORDEN PULLS MILK FROM STORES IN 2 STATES, CITES FEED 
Borden Inc., the world's largest dairy company, said it pulled its products 
from the shelves in two Southern states today after finding milk with traces of 
a toxic substance from contaminated feed. 
Borden spokeswoman Chris Tilton said it was not known if any of the 
contaminated products had been purchased, adding, "There should be no ill 
effects if the products have already been consumed." 
Borden pulled ice cream, milk, and other liquid dairy products from stores 
throughout Mississippi and in the northern two-thirds of Louisiana, she said. 
Cattle feed contaminated with barium carbonate apparently was used at 32 
dairies in the two-state area; the dairies' products were distributed in those 
two regions, she said.
