CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SACRAMENTO; 
BROWN REVISES PLAN TO POLICE LAWYERS 
Besieged by complaints from consumer interests and questions from state 
senators, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown agreed to water down a series of 
proposals that critics said would have weakened the state's lawyer disciplinary 
system. Brown, a San Francisco Democrat who was once subjected to an 
investigation by the California State Bar but absolved of any wrongdoing, had 
proposed changes that consumer interests believed would have eroded reforms put 
in place two years ago. 
Particularly controversial was Brown's proposal that complaints against lawyers 
be filed under penalty of perjury. Several senators argued that would 
discourage those with legitimate concerns from seeking disciplinary action. 
Brown agreed to instead give the Bar authority to notify district attorneys 
when people knowingly file false complaints. He also changed a proposal that 
would have required the Bar to keep all investigations confidential to one that 
would allow officials to disclose an investigation when it was necessary to 
protect consumers.
