SHOOTING STARS: The current issue of Discover magazine pays homage to Orange 
County Astronomers, the largest group of amateurs in the nation. 
With 600 members and an observatory near Mt. Palomar, the club has provided the 
magazine with spectacular color photographs of a comet, a solar prominence and 
several nebulae. . . . "As professional astronomers produce fewer and fewer 
pictures, amateurs are increasingly turning out stunning ones," says the 
article. It calls the club's 22-inch telescope "an amateur astronomer's dream."
