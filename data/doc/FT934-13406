FT  21 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness firm
International drinks group Guinness was once again the focus of attention as
NatWest Securities launched a Pounds 100m warrant, which gives investors the
chance to buy the underlying ordinary shares. The move will go some way to
shoring up investor confidence in the stock, which has recently been
undermined by a series of negative stories. It rallied 8 to 413p yesterday.
Since the group's poor set of results last month, the shares have slumped 22
per cent on a raft of bearish rumours. Many of these have concerned
Guinness's relationship with LVMH, with speculation rife that a
restructuring of the companies' 24 per cent cross-holding is likely. Talk of
executive changes was last week rewarded with the departure of the head of
United Distillers. Yesterday, old talk of an LVMH rights offer was matched
with rumours of a Pounds 400m Guinness bond issue.
However, NatWest said yesterday that it believed that Guinness represented
'the best long-term growth stock in the drinks sector', and that the warrant
had been driven by 'strong customer demand'.
Profits upgradings after a better than expected set of full-year figures
from aerospace and medical products group Smiths Industries drove the stock
sharply forward to record one of the day's biggest advances in the market.
The shares closed 39 ahead at 394p on active trading of 4.1m, after Smiths
reported a rise in profits from Pounds 102.2m to Pounds 104.6m, against
market predictions of around Pounds 99m.
Strauss Turnbull raised its current year forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds
110m, although many are predicting profits for this year of Pounds 115m. Mr
Mustapha Omar at Williams de Broe, a long-time bull of the stock, is
sticking to his forecast at the top end of the range at Pounds 119m.
He said: 'Even after today's share price move, Smiths' price/earnings ratio
for the current year is still at a discount to the market. There is scope
for a cyclical bounce in earnings in the industrial division which will
benefit profits.'
A clutch of recommendations lifted Commercial Union, the shares advancing 11
to 636p. Brokers at Credit Lyonnais Laing were said to be positive on the
stock, as are those at Smith New Court. Mr Steven Bird at Smith believes
'the market continues to undervalue its life operations and it has yield
attractions as well'.
The market trend helped to produce a bounce in the rest of the composites.
General Accident put on 6 at 713p, while Royal Insurance finished 4 ahead at
323p, Sun Alliance gained 5 at 384p and Guardian Royal Exchange moved
forward 5 to 216p.
Sentiment began to strengthen around BP, and US buyers were reported to be
active again in the stock. Kleinwort Benson also added their voice to the BP
support with a buy note. The shares climbed 6 to 339 1/2 p.
Burmah Castrol rose forcefully in a generally upbeat oil sector. The shares
added 15 at 775p a day after the announcement by BZW of an auction of just
over 1m of the shares from the company's recent enhanced scrip dividend.
Second line oil stocks again proved popular. Enterprise Oil firmed 4 to 503p
and Hardy Oil put on 4 at 180p. Premier Consolidated Oilfields ended 2 up at
24 3/4 p on exploration news.
Shell Transport went against the sector trend and lost 2 to 706p. In
Kleinwort's buy advice on BP it had urged a hold position on Shell.
The strong market trend helped international conglomerate BTR overcome a
reported profits downgrade from agency broker James Capel. However, it was
said to have remained positive on the stock. The shares hardened 4 to 366p
in strong business of 7m.
Yield buyers were seen for international group Hanson, helping the shares
rise 4 to 273p in trade of 11m.
Bank of Scotland appreciated 6 to 192p after Kleinwort Benson advised
investors to buy the stock. Analysts at the securities house believe its
'growth potential has been underestimated by the market'.
Further profit-taking in Standard Chartered saw the shares relinquish 14 to
1004p. Bargain hunters on the back of the strong market trend brought a
bounce to National Westminster shares, 3 higher at 562p, and Barclays, which
gained 4 to 562p.
BT's drive forward continued, with Hoare Govett voicing its enthusiasm in
the wake of news of the group's move into the potentially lucrative video
market. The shares added 8 at 472p. Profit-taking continued in Cable and
Wireless, off 4 at 948p, and Vodafone, down 14 at 546p, with Lehman Brothers
said to have downgraded profits expectations.
There was lumpy turnover in Scottish Power, up 7 at 410p, which reached 8.8m
by the close.
Stores responded well to the latest retail sales figures and continued hopes
of an interest rate cut. Argos rose 5 to 349p, Body Shop 5 to 205p, Dixons 4
to 281p, Kingfisher 5 to 647p, Next 6 to 195p and Storehouse 2 to 206p.
Marks and Spencer received an additional boost from a Goldman Sachs upgrade,
climbing 6 to 406p.
Engineering group FKI bounced 4 to 173p after NatWest Securities came out
with a favourable note following the recent analysts' visit to the company's
US operation.
NatWest said: 'The group's ability to improve margins, generate a
substantial amount of cash, and effectively redeploy that cash into bolt-on
acquisitions . . . means that we remain convinced that there is scope for
further outperformance over the long term.'
The announcement by Wellcome of test results for its antiviral drug
Valaciclovir saw the shares rise 11 1/2 to 786 1/2 p.
A negative note from Goldman Sachs was said to have undermined Granada
Group, which slipped back 6 to 482p.
Bass, up 5 at 481p, was helped by reports of NatWest Securities moving from
negative to neutral on the stock.
ICI retreated 18 to 709p in moderate volume of 1.8m, with James Capel
reaffirming its negative stance.
