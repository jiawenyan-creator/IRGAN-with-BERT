FRAIL DENG XIAOPING APPEARS IN PUBLIC 
Senior leader Deng Xiaoping made his first public appearance since July, voting 
Wednesday in citywide elections in the capital. 
The 86-year-old leader, believed to be suffering from cancer, appeared frail. 
Deng was shown on state television moving steadily but a bit shakily to the 
voter registration table. His daughter held his arm as he walked to the ballot 
box and dropped in his ballot. However, the official New China News Agency 
described Deng as walking vigorously to the polling station in Beijing.
