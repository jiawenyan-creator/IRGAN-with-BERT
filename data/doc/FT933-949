FT  27 SEP 93 / World Bank/IMF Meeting: Japan expects to boost economy with
tax reforms
THE Japanese government expects to implement a tax reform package, including
an income tax cut, which will stimulate the economy in the medium term, the
G7 meeting was told by Mr Hirohisa Fujii, Japanese finance minister.
Mr Fujii said after the meeting that Japan believed the recent cut in its
discount rate, together with measures to raise public investment and the
planned tax reforms, would be enough to raise demand in the economy.
His comments on tax reforms, which are being studied by a panel at the
request of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, follow calls from
business leaders for a prompt cut in income tax to stimulate demand.
Mr Fujii said tax reform could have a deflationary effect in the short term
because a rise in consumption taxes would outweigh the stimulative effect of
an income tax cut, but in the medium term it would be beneficial.
The presentation of the new Japanese government's economic reform proposals
was welcomed by other G7 members, despite earlier indications that they
wanted further measures to increase economic demand.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary who chaired the meeting, said the G7
partners 'looked forward to far-reaching deregulation of the economy, and
tax reform too'. This was 'obviously under serious consideration'.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, said 'anything the Japanese government can
do to stimulate demand is welcome to Japan's trade partners'. However, it
was for the Japanese government to determine the right measures.
Mr Fujii emphasised there had been 'no critical comments' about Japan. He
said the rapid appreciation of the yen against the dollar had damaged the
economy, and precipitous exchange rate fluctuations were to be avoided.
