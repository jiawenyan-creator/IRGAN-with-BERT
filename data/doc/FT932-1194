FT  24 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slides against strong yen
THE DOLLAR continued to hold centre stage in the currency markets yesterday
but the focus of attention shifted to its exchange rate against the yen,
writes Sandeep Deol.
The dollar weakened in London to close at Y109.15, against Y111.35 on
Tuesday. In New York it finished at Y109.0.
A resurgence of the yen was evident soon after the markets opened.
Profit-taking on the dollar's recent gains reversed the trend of eight
consecu-tive days of dollar rallies and the currency quickly moved to trade
below Y111.
The spark for more intense dollar selling came in the afternoon with the
release of disappointing US economic data. Durable goods orders fell 1.6 per
cent in May against forecasts of a 1.1 per cent rise. First-quarter GDP
growth was also weaker than expected, revised down to 0.7 per cent from 0.9
per cent before.
Revived rumours from New York that President Bill Clinton was seeking a
stronger yen to correct Japan's huge trade surplus with the US also boosted
sentiment for the yen.
Mr Steven Hannah, director of research at IBJ International, suggests that
the large Japanese trade surpluses will continue and that the US appears to
have few other approaches to correct the imbalance.
The yen rise is expected to continue in the near term unless, says Mr Mark
Austin, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, Japanese local
elections at the weekend see significant weakening in the position of the
LDP.
The dollar slide against the yen was mirrored to a lesser extent against the
D-Mark. The dollar closed near the day's low in London at DM1.6935 from an
early high of DM1.7060 and London's close on Tuesday of DM1.6970. It ended
in New York at DM1.6920.
The Japanese currency also appreciated sharply against the D-Mark in spite
of only a very moderate easing of rates at yesterday's German securities
repurchase tender. The Bundesbank trimmed its 'repo' rate by just one basis
point to 7.59 per cent.
The yen had climbed to Y64.50 to the D-Mark by the close from Tuesday's
Y65.59 finish and now stands very close to its all-time high of Y64.1
reached last week.
The softer D-Mark allowed another European central bank to trim its interest
rates yesterday. The Bank of Spain cut its intervention rate by around  1/4
point to 11.55 per cent.
This resulted in a slight easing of the peseta against the D-Mark, which
finished in London at Pta76.25 from the previous day's Pta76.16.
Sterling saw very little interest in the absence of any significant economic
statistics. It failed to make headway against any of the major currencies
and was unaffected by the news that UK construction orders rose 10 per cent
in the three months to April.
The pound lost 1 1/2 pfennigs to finish at DM2.4925. Against the dollar it
ended at Dollars 1.4725 from Dollars 1.4780.
