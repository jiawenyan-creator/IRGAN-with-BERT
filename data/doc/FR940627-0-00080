Modification of unsafe harbor percentage for plans 
satisfying ratio percentage test at 90 percent level

_(A) 

General 
rule.

 If a plan benefits a group of employees for a plan year 
that would satisfy the ratio percentage test of 1.410(b)2(b)(2) 
on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis under paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section if the percentage in 1.410(b)2(b)(2) 
were increased to 90 percent, the unsafe harbor percentage in 
1.410(b)4(c)(4)(ii) for the plan is reduced by five percentage 
points (not five percent) for the plan year and is applied 
without regard to the requirement that the unsafe harbor 
percentage not be less than 20 percent. Thus, if the 
requirements of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) are satisfied, the 
unsafe harbor percentage in 1.410(b)4(c)(4)(ii) is treated as 
35 percent, reduced by 3/4 of a percentage point for each whole 
percentage point by which the nonhighly compensated employee 
concentration percentage exceeds 60 percent. 
(B) 

Facts and circumstances alternative.

 If a plan 
satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this 
section, but has a ratio percentage on an employer-wide basis 
that falls below the unsafe harbor percentage determined under 
paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the plan nonetheless is 
deemed to satisfy section 410(b)(5)(B) on an employer-wide basis 
if the Commissioner determines that, on the basis of all of the 
relevant facts and circumstances, the plan benefits such 
employees as qualify under a classification of employees that 
does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.

Example 2.

 The facts are the same as in 

Example 1.

 All of 
the 50 highly compensated employees treated as employees of Line 
2 benefit under Plan Y, and 80 of the 100 nonhighly compensated 
employees treated as employees of Line 2 benefit under Plan Y. 
Thus, Plan Y benefits 50 percent of all Employer A's highly 
compensated employees (50 out of 100) and only 4 percent of all 
Employer A's nonhighly compensated employees (80 out of 2,000). 
Thus, while Plan Y has a ratio percentage of 80 percent (80%
100%) on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis, it has a 
ratio percentage of only 8 percent (4%
50%) on an employer-wide 
basis. See 1.410(b)9. Under 1.410(b)4(c)(4)(iii), the 
nonhighly compensated employee concentration percentage is 
2,000/2,100 or 95 percent. Because 8 percent is less than 20 
percent (the unsafe harbor percentage applicable to Employer A 
under 1.410(b)4(c)(4)(ii)), Plan Y does not satisfy the 
nondiscriminatory classification test of 1.410(b)4 on an 
employer-wide basis. Nor does Plan Y satisfy the ratio 
percentage test of 1.410(b)2(b)(2) on an employer-wide basis, 
since 8 percent is less than 70 percent. Under these facts, Plan 
Y does not satisfy section 410(b)(5)(B) on an employer-wide basis 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the plan 
year of Plan Y beginning in the 1994 testing year, and therefore 
fails to satisfy section 410(b) for that year. This is true even 
though Plan Y satisfies section 410(b) on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis in accordance with paragraph
(b)(3) of 
this section. 


Example 3.

 The facts are the same as in 

Example 2,

 except 
that all of the employees treated as employees of Line 2 benefit 
under Plan Y. Thus, Plan Y benefits 50 percent of all of 
Employer A's highly compensated employees (50 out of 100) and 5 
percent of all of Employer A's nonhighly compensated employees 
(100 out of 2,000). Plan Y therefore has a ratio percentage of 
100 percent (100%
100%) on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis and a ratio percentage of 10 percent (5%
50%) on 
an employer-wide basis. Because Plan Y has a ratio percentage of 
at least 90 percent on a qualified-separate-line-of-business 
basis, a reduced unsafe harbor percentage applies to Plan Y under 
paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. The reduced unsafe 
harbor percentage applicable to Plan Y is 8.75 percent because 
Employer A's nonhighly compensated employee concentration 
percentage is 95 percent. Plan Y's employer-wide ratio 
percentage of 10 percent therefore exceeds the unsafe harbor 
percentage. Plan Y thus satisfies section 410(b)(5)(B) on an 
employer-wide basis in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section for the plan year of Plan Y beginning in the 1994 testing 
year. Plan Y also satisfies section 410(b) on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis in accordance with paragraph

(b)(3) of this section. 


Example 4.

 The facts are the same as in 

Example 3,

 except 
that Employer A's total nonexcludable nonhighly compensated 
employees are 2,500 (rather than 2,000), of whom 100 are treated 
as employees of Line 2 and of whom 90 benefit under Plan Y. Plan 
Y has a ratio percentage of 90 percent (90%
100%) on a 
qualified-separate-line-of-business basis, and Employer A's 
nonhighly compensated employee concentration percentage is 
2,500/2,600 or 96 percent. Thus, the reduced unsafe harbor 
percentage applicable to Plan Y under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of 
this section is 8 percent. Plan Y benefits 50 percent of all of 
Employer A's highly compensated employees (50 out of 100) and 3.6 
percent of all of Employer A's nonhighly compensated employees 
(90 out of 2,500). Plan Y therefore has a ratio percentage of 
only 7.2 percent (3.6%
50%) on an employer-wide basis, which 
falls below the reduced unsafe harbor percentage of 8 percent. 
Nonetheless, under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, Plan 
Y will be deemed to satisfy section 410(b)(5)(B) on an employer-wide basis if the Commissioner determines that, on
the basis of 
all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the plan benefits 
such employees as qualify under a classification of employees 
that does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated 
employees.
