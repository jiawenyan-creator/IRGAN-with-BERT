<F P=106> [Interview with Etienne Tshisekedi, leader of the Zairian </F>
Union for Democracy and Social Progress, by AFRICAN EVENTS 
reporter Jean-Marie Mabiti Angali, in Kinshasa "at the end of 
the year" -- first two paragraphs are editorial introduction] 
  [Text] In the upheavals of recent months, there has 
sometimes been criticism of the silence maintained by Etienne 
Tshisekedi, the symbolic figure of the opposition and the prime 
minister elected by the Sovereign National Conference [CNS]. 
For a large section of this opposition, he is essential and 
should be prime minister during the transition. But it is not 
at all certain that Mobutu will give him his backing. 
  A few hours, or a few days at most, before the appointment 
of 
a new government chief, we are publishing an interview with the 
leader of the UDPS (Union for Democracy and Social Progress). 
These remarks were gathered at the end of the year by 
Jean-Marie Mabiti Angali, a reporter from AFRICAN EVENTS, an 
African magazine published in Brussels. They give an idea of 
Tshisekedi's state of mind. In his view, the democratic process 
is irreversible and no attention should be paid to Mobutu's 
maneuvers. 
  [Angali] Despite the current problems, you still seem to 
enjoy great popularity among the Zairian population. You, 
therefore, seem essential. What is the basis of this popularity? 
  [Tshisekedi] It is difficult to know what the basis of this 
popularity is. I presume that the population recognizes that I 
have the merit of having fought the dictatorship from within and 
having forced it to make the current concessions. The people 
probably appreciate the constancy of my approach in our people's 
liberation struggle. 
  Above all, it is important that the people should recognize 
the sacrifices that I have made with so many others to bring the 
country to the present situation. We are sure that there will 
be full democracy. Whatever the current problems, democracy is 
a definitive achievement in our country. 
  [Angali] The country is currently awaiting the result of the 
political negotiations to end the duplication of institutions. 
What is your view of this situation? 
  [Tshisekedi] If we have reached this situation, it is 
entirely due to Mobutu upping the stakes. He is aware of the 
pressures being exerted by the people for him to resign and to 
leave the country. He has committed enough crimes already. 
Knowing the state of mind of the people, he is using his 
weapons and his tribal police to resist the people's will. All 
his machinations are also aimed at showing that the institutions 
are worth nothing without him. This must not be taken 
seriously. It is just his way of resisting change. The people 
have shown for months that they had confidence in our government 
and not in that of the political vagabonds who are an object of 
ridicule for our people. 
<H5>  Mobutu the Adventurer </H5>
  [Angali] You are well acquainted with Mobutu. What did you 
have in common that enabled you to work together for many years? 
  [Tshisekedi] It is wrong to say that we worked together. He 
did not take me into his government. Following his coup d'etat 
in 1965, he appointed General Mulamba as prime minister. He 
asked the deputies and senators to submit to him two ministerial 
candidates per region. As a young deputy, I was chosen and 
became interior minister. 
  The fact that I worked in that government has nothing to do 
with Mobutu. I was determined to serve my country which was 
beset by major problems. If I was with Mobutu, it was simply to 
serve my country. 
  [Angali] So all you had in common was that desire to serve 
the country? 
  [Tshisekedi] In all events, that was my concern. I cannot 
speak for him. I can only judge him on what was seen later. I 
saw that he was in fact an adventurer and not a man serving the 
people. At first, he managed to deceive everybody by what he 
said. 
  We jointly founded the Popular Movement of the Revolution 
[MPR], not as a single party, but as a party which was to exist 
alongside another, in a real two-party system. 
  We jointly wrote the Constitution of 24 June 1967. It made 
provisions for a two-party system. But when it was adopted by 
referendum, he realized that it would have to be implemented. 
He caused me enough problems on that subject and finally forced 
me out of the government in August 1969. At that time, I did 
not understand much. 
  However, I understood when Mobutu carried out various 
maneuvers to remove Article 4 of the Constitution, which made 
provisions for that two-party system, and convened the MPR in 
1970. The aim was to establish the single party. 
  It was then that I really knew that he was an adventurer. I 
withdrew my confidence and support from him. However, at the 
time he was very strong and it was impossible to start an open 
struggle with him. I, therefore, took my time to avoid being an 
martyr. 
  I took advantage of my democratic reelection as a deputy in 
1977 to launch actions against the dictatorship within 
Parliament with other colleagues. 
  So, you know why I fought against the dictatorship. This 
fight is now on the point of succeeding. I no longer believe in 
Mobutu's power to withstand the movement toward democracy. 
  [Angali] It is sometimes said that your struggle is 
primarily 
the result of personal rather than political disagreements... 
  [Tshisekedi] I started the struggle for our people's 
liberation with 12 parliamentary colleagues. We published an 
open letter which is the basis of the action. All those who say 
that I am settling personal scores merely have to reread that 
letter. There is nothing personal in it. The letter notes the 
Mobutu regime's failure and advocates what political behavior to 
adopt for the democratization of the nation. 
  [Angali] Some people think that the present crisis is a 
crisis about individuals. You seem sincere, as Mobutu was on 24 
April 1990... 
  [Tshisekedi] Mobutu has never been sincere. He simply gave 
in to internal and external pressures for democracy. But he 
made every effort to oppose the process. Fortunately, there are 
men who are fighting to achieve democracy. 
<H5>  Respecting the Conference </H5>
  [Angali] There have been several attempts at cohabitation 
between you. Is this still possible? 
  [Tshisekedi] There is no question of attempts at 
cohabitation. We have abandoned the dictatorial culture, the 
Second Republic in which one individual ruled the whole nation. 
With the CNS, we entered a new culture: That of democracy in 
which everybody must submit to the majority and the law. 
Because I was democratically elected through the CNS, there is 
no question of discussing cohabitation. Everybody must submit 
to the CNS plan. Nobody can replace it by another. If it is 
not respected, the liberation struggle will continue. 
  [Angali] One of the criticisms made against you is that many 
people think you made a mistake when you crossed out any mention 
of the constitution on your appointment in October 1991. What 
is your reply to them? 
  [Tshisekedi] There was no reason for me to accept that 
because that constitution, instituting the one-party state, had 
been dead since 24 April 1990. In addition, we discussed it and 
Mobutu agreed to me swearing allegiance only to the law and not 
to a Constitution which no longer existed. He presented me with 
a fait accompli. I could not accept it. 
  [Angali] You have experienced Zaire's history. On the basis 
of that experience, do you think that a parliamentary system is 
viable in our country? 
  [Tshisekedi] It is fully viable. If it is freely engendered 
by the people, it reflects the maturity attained by them in 
their concept of the state and the political system. It will 
therefore succeed, especially because it is not being imposed 
from outside. 
  If it proves to have imperfections in practice, it is for 
the 
people to make any adjustments. A system freely designed by the 
people must be administered by them. 
<H5>  UDPS in the Majority </H5>
  [Angali] After the transition, will you be a candidate in 
the 
parliamentary or presidential elections? 
  [Tshisekedi] I will naturally be a candidate. However, the 
party will first hold a congress which will appoint the 
presidential candidate on the basis of the various nominations 
submitted. 
  [Angali] Some UDPS members have defected recently. Does that 
affect you? 
  [Tshisekedi] No. The UDPS is now the majority party in Zaire 
and cannot be too much affected by the departure of some people. 
  [Angali] At the national conference, you forgave those who 
wronged you. Do you forgive those who have left the party? 
  [Tshisekedi] It is not a question of forgiveness but of 
respecting everybody's convictions. That is democracy. I 
respect convictions and individuals. 
  I do not like dogmas. I am a pragmatist. 
  [Angali] Is the UDPS a tribal party? 
  [Tshisekedi] I think that the UDPS has proved its 
nationalism. To lead the people where we have led them, tribal 
questions must be abandoned. I do not concern myself with 
tribal problems. 
<H5>  Western Support </H5>
  [Angali] Do you believe in the support of the Western 
troika? 
  [Tshisekedi] I prefer to think that it supports the 
democratization process rather than an individual. Institutions 
must be supported rather than individuals. 
  [Angali] Do you think the Belgians still know Zaire? 
  [Tshisekedi] I think they, of all foreigners, know the 
country best. Some mistakes have probably been made. However, 
they are primarily the result of the machinations of a certain 
political class, particularly the one which grew up alongside 
Mobutu. They are now in opposition, but they are still working 
for Mobutu. 
  [Angali] If you obtain power in the future, will you reopen 
the Belgian-Zairian dispute? 
  [Tshisekedi] Tshisekedi will never be a dictator replacing 
the other dictator. This is a democratic country and we must 
respect the laws, the institutions. Parliament will have to 
discuss this question if it thinks it is necessary to do so. 
  [Angali] How can the crisis be solved? 
  [Tshisekedi] Mobutu must be involved in the CNS plan. All 
the solutions have been laid down by it, Mobutu must agree to 
implement them with us. In that way, there will be no crisis.
