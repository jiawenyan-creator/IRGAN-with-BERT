 



a. Actions Taken By the General Partner: 

New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)a. provides that it presumptively unfair and unreasonable for general partners, when
determining their interest in the new entity resulting from a limited partnership rollup transaction, to: (1) convert
an equity interest for which consideration has not been paid into a voting interest in the new entity if the equity interest
was not otherwise provided for in the limited partnership agreement and disclosed to limited partners; (2) fail to
follow the valuation methods, if any, in the partnership agreements when valuing their partnership interests;

43

 or (3) utilize a projected value of their equity interest rather than the appraised current value of their equity interest
when determining their interest in the new entity.

In its comment letter, the ABA pointed out that partnership agreements do not generally contain such valuation provisions.
The NASD amended its rule to clarify that it applies to rollups that contain valuation provisions. See Amendment No.

b. Voting Rights: 

New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)b. contains four provisions for the protection of investors with respect to voting rights.
New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)b.1. provides that it is presumptively unfair if the voting rights in the entity resulting
from the limited partnerships rollup transaction do not follow the original voting rights of the limited partnerships
participating in the transaction. However, the NASD recognizes that certain material changes to voting rights may
be necessary to conform disparate rights that may exist among participating partnerships. Material changes may
be effected only if the NASD determines that the changes are not unfair or if an independent committee approves such
changes.

New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)b.2. provides that it is presumptively unfair if a majority

45

 of the interests in an entity resulting from a limited partnership rollup transaction is unable to vote to cause the
entity to take certain actions which are ordinarily the prerogative of the owners rather than management. Thus, it
is presumptively unfair not to permit a vote to amend the limited partnership agreement, articles of incorporation,
bylaws, or indenture. It is also presumptively unfair not to permit a vote to dissolve the entity. It is also presumptively
unfair not to permit a vote to remove and elect the general partners, board of directors, trustee, or similar governing
entity. Finally, it is presumptively unfair not to permit a vote to approve or disapprove the sale of substantially
all the assets of the entity, without concurrence by the sponsor, general partner(s), board of directors, trustee,
or similar governing entity, unless such actions would be inconsistent with state law.

The term ``majority'' refers to a 50%-plus-one vote except as superseded by state law or the partnership agreement
which may require a higher standard. See Amendment No. 5.

In response to several commenters, the NASD amended its rule to make it clear that it would not conflict with or supersede
state corporate law. See

 n. 5455 and accompanying text.

New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)b.3. provides that it is presumptively unfair if the sponsor or general partner proposing
a limited partnership rollup transaction is not required to provide a document which clearly delineates instructions
and procedures of voting against or dissenting from a proposed transaction. 

New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)b.4. provides that it is presumptively unfair if the general partner or sponsor fails
to utilize an independent third party to receive and tabulate all votes and dissents or fails to require the third party
to make the tabulation available to the general partner and any limited partner upon request at any time during and
after voting occurs. 



c. Transaction Costs: 

Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)c. provides that it is presumptively unfair if transaction costs of a rejected limited partnership
rollup transaction are not apportioned between the general and limited partners in accordance with the final vote
as follows: (1) in the case of a limited partnership rollup transaction which is not approved, the general partner
or sponsor bears transaction costs in proportion to the total number of abstentions and votes to reject the transaction,
and the limited partners bear transaction costs in proportion to the number of votes to approve the transaction; or
(2) in the case of a rollup transaction which is approved, but where some individual partnerships do not approve and
are not included in the approved transaction, the general partner is required to pay costs on behalf of the limited
partnerships who have voted not to approve the transaction. 

With respect to allocating total costs for a rejected limited partnership rollup transaction, the NASD believes
that subsections (b)(6(B) and (b)(6(C)(ii)d. taken together require the general partner to pay all the solicitation
expenses in addition to transaction costs in proportion to the total number of abstentions and votes to reject the
transaction. Additionally, limited partnerships which vote to reject and which are not included in a limited partnership
rollup transaction which is ultimately consummated, may not be assessed any transaction costs. 



d. Fees of the General Partners: 

New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)d. protects limited partners against the assessment of fees by a general partner which
are unfair, unreasonable, or inappropriate. New Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)d.1. provides that it is presumptively
unfair for general partners to receive or convert unearned management fees discounted to a present value while also
proposing to receive new asset-based fees. A similar presumption of unfairness applies if property management fees
and other fees are inappropriate, unreasonable, greater than or not competitive with the fees that would be paid to
third parties for performing similar services under proposed Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)d.2. Subsection (b)(6(C)(ii)d.3.
provides that substantial and adverse changes in fees are presumed unreasonable if not submitted to and approved
by an independent committee.
