FT  28 SEP 93 / Tendering clause for council staff
NEW GUIDANCE to be issued by the department of the environment covering
compulsory competitive tendering says councils can in some cases reject bids
from private contractors which do not intend to use the council's staff for
the work.
The guidance deals with the application to tendering of the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations 1981. Where the Tupe
regulations apply, a successful bidder must take over the workforce on their
existing terms and conditions.
The environment department note says contractors should be asked if their
bids assume Tupe applies.
If the local authority has legal advice that Tupe applies but the bid
assumes that it does not, the contractor should be invited to reconsider the
bid.
If the contractor refuses to submit a revised bid, the authority can turn it
down, even if it is the cheapest.
