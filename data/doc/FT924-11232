FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Hopes rise for Fokker
acquisition agreement
NEGOTIATIONS between the government of the Netherlands and Deutsche
Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany are to continue today in an effort to secure a
definitive agreement on Dasa's planned acquisition of a 51 per cent stake in
Fokker, the Dutch regional aeroplane manufacturer.
Lawyers are working out the details of an informal framework agreement
reached at the weekend on the three main sticking points in the long-running
negotiations.
These are the price to be paid for the Dutch state's shares in Fokker, the
future of the 50-seater Fokker 50, and the price which Fokker will pay for
aircraft components under the mooted industrial partnership.
Dasa, a subsidiary of the Daimler-Benz group, is expected to pay about Fl 37
(Dollars 21.15) per share for the Dutch government's 10.6m shares as well as
for the 13.2m shares which Fokker will issue to its new controlling
shareholder.
Fokker's shares closed up Fl 2.40 at Fl 18.20 yesterday on expectations that
the Dasa takeover, which has proved to be highly controversial in the
Netherlands since negotiations first began in early 1992, will go ahead as
planned.
The Dutch company's shares have fallen sharply since the government
provisionally endorsed the takeover in July, when the shares were worth
about Fl 30.
Dasa and the Dutch government had hoped to be able to sign a final agreement
yesterday, clearing the way for formal approval to be sought from the two
companies' works councils as well as from European Community authorities in
Brussels.
The Dutch government is expected to win an undertaking from Dasa that it
would continue production of the Fokker 50 as long as commercially feasible.
But the contract is likely to fall short of a guarantee that production will
not be halted or moved abroad under any circumstances.
