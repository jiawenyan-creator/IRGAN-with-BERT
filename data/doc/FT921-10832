FT  04 FEB 92 / Broad support for innovation proposals
THE GOVERNMENT and the Labour party yesterday welcomed proposals to
introduce an extra tier of research and technology institutions modelled on
German lines.
The suggestion has come in an interim report from the Working Group on
Innovation, an independent initiative set up last year.
The idea is to build a bridge between the academic world and industry. The
report is yet to be approved by the Prince of Wales, who commissioned it.
Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, said yesterday that the
proposals would 'be very helpful'.
The report suggested Germany's Fraunhofer Institutes as 'one of the
yardsticks against which to measure solutions for this country'. However,
the report added that they were not necessarily a 'complete model'.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, welcomed the report
which he said was consistent with Labour's 'commitment for designating
innovation cities'.
The report says that independent research and technology companies should be
given a higher public profile and receive some public money.
The Centre for Exploitation of Science and Technology - chaired by Sir John
Fairclough, former chief scientific adviser to the cabinet - which was
involved in the writing of the report, said last month that such
intermediate institutions would help 'national strategic thinking on
technology exploitation'.
The final report is due out this summer.
