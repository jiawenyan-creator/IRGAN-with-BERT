FT  22 JUL 94 / Quebec poll date expected
Quebec's Premier Daniel Johnson was yesterday expected to announce
provincial elections for September 12, giving his Quebec Liberals six weeks
to roll back the separatist Parti Quebecois' lead in the polls, writes
Robert Gibbens from Montreal. Recent opinion polls put the PQ 10 points
ahead among decided voters, with the undecideds having declined sharply.
