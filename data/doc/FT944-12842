FT  31 OCT 94 / Optimism about job prospects increases
Public optimism about general employment prospects has risen in the latest
FT/MFS Mood of the Nation index published today, but people are increasingly
anxious about their own futures.
After falling to 83 points in early September because of the rise in
interest rates - its lowest since last spring - the index climbed to 88
points in October.
The survey also indicates, however, that a sharp decline has taken place in
the proportion of people who are optimistic about their own prospects in the
next 12 months.
Only 29 per cent said they expected their personal economic position to
improve in the period, while 20 per cent said it would get worse by next
October. As many as 44 per cent said their position would remain the same.
More people believe Britain's general economic condition will worsen in the
next 12 months than improve, which suggests that considerable doubt about
the recovery remains.
While 23 per cent believe the economy will improve between now and next
October, 35 per cent said that it would get worse and 37 per cent that it
would stay the same. By contrast 21 per cent said they were 'very concerned'
about being made redundant or becoming unemployed and 20 per cent were
'fairly concerned'.
Britain will not experience a sharp return to wage inflation or an
escalation in pay settlements in the next 12 months, says the independent
Industrial Relations Services in its annual review of pay prospects
published today.
The report says settlements are likely to rise by between 3 per cent and 3.5
per cent early next year.
IRS says that the downward pressure on settlements in recent years, caused
by poor corporate performance and an inability to raise product prices,
remains strong.
