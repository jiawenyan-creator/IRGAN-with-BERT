  [Text] Hong Kong, May 5 (XINHUA) -- The meeting of the 
economic affairs panel of the Preliminary Working Committee for 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) ended here 
today after two days of practical discussions. 
  Coordination between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland on 
major infrastructure projects in the territory was the focus of 
today's discussions. 
  Panel members believed that following the economic 
development, contacts between Hong Kong and the mainland are on 
the rise and construction of major projects, including those of 
railway, aviation, highway and port, are directly linked with 
economic progress of the two places. 
  Thus, they said, further communication and coordination 
between the two parties is needed for this important and urgent 
issue. And the aim of the coordination is to promote the 
economic development of the mainland and Hong Kong. 
  The members said the infrastructure is beneficial to both 
sides and coordination is needed in both planning and 
organization. They suggest a high-level coordination group be 
set up. 
  On land fund, leaders of the panel reiterated that the fund 
belongs to the future SAR government which will then manage it. 
No other person should have the right to interfere in this 
matter. 
  During the meeting, the panel also reviewed its work in the 
past six months.
