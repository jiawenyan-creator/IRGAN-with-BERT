DOCTOR IS UNSAFE TO PRACTICE, BOARD CHARGES 
State medical authorities are seeking to revoke or suspend the license of a 
Woodland Hills doctor they charge has a mental disorder that may render him 
unable to safely practice medicine. 
Dr. Edward V. Madey suffers from borderline personality disorder and has shown 
"impaired judgment . . . that may affect his ability to practice medicine in a 
way that would ensure safety to those to whom he administers as well as to 
himself," the Medical Board of California said in a complaint made public 
Monday. 
Madey could not be reached for comment. Deputy Atty. Gen. Nancy Ann Stoner, who 
prepared the complaint for the board, said Madey has filed a notice that he 
intends to defend himself against the charges, brought in May. No hearing date 
has been set. 
Medical board executive director Kenneth Wagstaff said in the complaint that 
Madey twice tried to kill himself in 1982 and was twice hospitalized for "a 
major depressive syndrome." 
Wagstaff said that in a series of letters in 1985 and 1986 to his ex-wife, her 
family and attorney, Madey also threatened repeatedly to commit suicide "if his 
financial demands were not met." 
Stoner said she was not aware that any of Madey's patients had experienced 
problems with him. She also said she could not elaborate on the content of his 
letters. 
Madey voluntarily underwent a psychiatric evaluation in 1988 and was determined 
to be suffering from borderline personality disorder, said Stoner. She said the 
American Psychiatric Assn. defines the disorder as a "pervasive pattern of 
instability of self-image, interpersonal relationships and mood, beginning by 
early adulthood." 
An APA diagnostic manual said those suffering from the disorder often make 
repeated suicide threats and have trouble controlling their anger. 
Vern Leeper, the medical board's enforcement chief, said the board files 
charges against doctors with psychiatric problems about once a month.
