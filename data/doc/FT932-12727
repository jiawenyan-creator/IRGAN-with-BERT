FT  27 APR 93 / The Lex Column: United Biscuits
The 11 per cent rise in United Biscuits' share price in the past two trading
days shows how excited the market is becoming about a possible break-up bid.
UB's supposed vulnerability lies in the weakness of Ross Young's and
Keebler, which account for half UB's assets but generate poor returns. UB
has long argued it would not be wise to sell at fire-sale prices. Besides,
it finally appears to be making progress in rationalising both companies.
But thanks to the wonders of acquisition accounting, a bidder could take
short cuts, enduring greater rationalisation pain than UB could stomach.
This would leave the acquirer with UB's two attractive core businesses.
McVitie's biscuits could be run for cash, KP snacks for growth.
The trouble with this scenario is the timing and context. Any lurking asset
strippers would have struck seven months ago when Keebler's problems
undermined the shares. A bidder must also know a hostile approach would
surely send UB scurrying into the arms of a white knight.
UB will hardly moan if the bid premium remains in the price. It may even be
able to catch up with the rating on pure trading grounds if the recovery at
Keebler proves as fast as some suspect. The launch of a cigarette price war
by Philip Morris will squeeze RJR Nabisco hard. There could be some
relaxation of Nabisco's aggression in the biscuits market which so
embarrassed Keebler.
