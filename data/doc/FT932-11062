FT  06 MAY 93 / Advice on mortgage choices attacked
MORTGAGE ADVICE from banks, building societies and mortgage brokers is
usually misleading or inaccurate, according to the latest findings of
Which?, the Consumers' Association monthly publication.
The magazine says advisers overwhelmingly recommend endowment mortgages  -
where the loan is linked to a life insurance savings policy - which pay
commission to the mortgage institution selling them.
The research was carried out at 100 lenders in Cardiff, Edinburgh, London
and Manchester.
Which? found that in 78 per cent of cases involving a mortgage
recommendation an endowment was said to be the best type even though a
repayment mortgage - where interest and capital is repayed over the term of
the loan - was at least as suitable.
'Mortgage advice is too often biased with an eye to lucrative commissions,'
said Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the Consumers' Association.
She added: 'Advisers frequently twisted the facts in their eagerness to sell
endowment policies, often downplaying the merits of suitable repayment
mortgages.'
