FT  25 APR 91 / Mortage rise
MORTGAGE advances by building societies rose to Pounds 3.356bn in March
compared to Pounds 2.681bn in February as falling interest rates spurred
homebuying. Receipts fell to Pounds 543m from Pounds 608m in February,
mainly because investors withdrew funds to apply for electricity shares.
