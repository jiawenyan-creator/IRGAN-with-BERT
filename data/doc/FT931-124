FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Dash blamed for Pounds 1m Alexon loss
AS IT warned in January, Alexon Group, the women's wear retailer, lost
nearly Pounds 1m before tax last year and passed its final dividend.
It slid to a Pounds 986,000 loss in the 53 weeks to January 30 from an
Pounds 11.3m profit in the previous 52 weeks. Sales declined from Pounds
114.2m to Pounds 107.8m. Worst affected was the Dash casualwear chain, which
fell into losses.
With cash conservation paramount this year, no interim dividend is expected.
Mr Lawrence Snyder, chairman, said the group had renegotiated its banking
facilities after a trebling of net debt from Pounds 7.7m to Pounds 23m and a
breaching of covenants. Borrowings, which had all been short term, had been
switched to three years and the facility expanded. The rise in debt followed
an increase in stock to Pounds 44.7m (Pounds 41.4m), about Pounds 8m more
than in January 1991, and tax and dividend payments of about Pounds 9m.
Mr Snyder said: 'Debt reduction is the priority.' He hoped gearing would
come down from 73 per cent to less than 50 per cent within two years. A
crucial factor would be destocking.
Operating profit fell from Pounds 12.6m to less than Pounds 2m, which failed
to cover interest charges of Pounds 2.05m. Reorganisation costs amounted to
Pounds 910,000.
Profits made by Eastex women's wear, the one success story, were more than
offset by Dash's losses.
Dash was badly affected by reduced consumer spending and undermined by
cheaper look-alike products. Mr Snyder said sales were 15 to 16 per cent
down and much less stock was sold at full price, depressing margins. Fixed
costs had risen, including rents by more than Pounds 1m.
Winter clearance had continued into this month and the spring range launched
later than usual. Although February/March sales were down, the trend was
improving. Prices on some basic items had been cut by 20 per cent.
Alexon made a negligible profit on sales down 5-6 per cent. Progress was
made in the relatively small continental business.
Losses were 12.15p (earnings of 23p). The passing of the final dividend
leaves shareholders with 3p (10.6p) for the year.
