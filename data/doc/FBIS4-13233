  [Text] Our correspondent reports that tension prevails 
between members of Amal and Hizballah activists in the southern 
villages following the murder of Ni'mah Khaldun Haydar, Amal's 
military official in the south, by a car bomb today. 
  Our correspondent adds that Amal activists in al-Nabatiyah 
and the neighboring villages accuse Hizballah of being 
responsible for the explosion, and that this explosion was 
perpetrated by the same people who have blown up cars belonging 
to Amal officials in Khirbat Silm, Zawtar al-Gharbiyah, and Bi'r 
al-Salasil in the past few months. 
  The same correspondent notes that there was a deep rift 
between Haydar and Hizballah members. There was an attempt on 
his life on 12 April 1990, when Hizballah members detonated an 
explosive device in Iqlim al-Tuffah which wounded Haydar.
