  [Text] Tehran--IRNA. 7 Dey [28 December] The Japanese 
Ministry of Justice announced that during the two months of 
September and October (10 Shahrivar to 10 Aban) 272 Iranians 
were expelled from Japan for the crime of illegal employment. 
  The Associated Press reports that during these two months 
police agents raided Iranian worker gathering places in Tokyo 
and other large cities in Japan and expelled 2,697 foreign 
workers, including 999 women. 
  Most of the statistics on expelled workers pertain to Thai 
citizens (632 people). Iranians, with a total of 372 [as 
published], are the fourth-largest group of expelled foreigners. 
  In the year 1991 A.D., of the 32,908 foreigners expelled 
from 
Japan for illegal employment, 7,700 were Iranian. At the same 
time, a small number of Japanese citizens oppose the Tokyo 
government's policy of expelling foreign workers and they 
consider it to be a kind of selfishness. 
  Several days ago 100 Japanese demonstrated asking the 
government to permit foreigners to work in order to obtain cheap 
manpower, and not to expel them.
