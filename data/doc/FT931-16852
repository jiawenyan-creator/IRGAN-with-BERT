FT  04 JAN 93 / International Company News: Maple Leaf doubles its estate
with Allied deal
MAPLE LEAF Inns, the joint venture created last year by Labatt, the Canadian
brewer, and Pubmaster, the Brent Walker subsidiary, has doubled the size of
its estate by acquiring the leases of 73 pubs from Allied Breweries.
The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Maple Leaf is acquiring the
pubs on 10-year leases, with an option to buy the freeholds after two years.
Mr John Brackenbury, chairman of Pubmaster and also of Maple Leaf, said: 'We
intend to continue the company's expansion throughout 1993 and are currently
considering a number of other acquisition opportunities from several
different parties.'
Maple Leaf was launched last June and bought its initial 77 pubs in two
deals with Bass Taverns, the most recent of which was signed in September.
It intends to expand its state to a total of 1,000 pubs nationally.
The company's first pubs were concentrated principally in the north-west of
England, the Midlands and in Wales. The new deal extends the estate's
geographical reach by adding a further concentration of pubs in the home
counties and London, as well as more outlets in the east Midlands.
Maple Leaf's pubs stock a range of national and regional ales and lagers,
including Labatt's. The Canadian brewer also has national distribution
throughout Pubmaster's 2,026-strong national estate following a distribution
deal signed by the two companies last year.
Pubmaster's estate doubled in size last year as a result of successive pub
acquisition deals with Allied-Lyons, Whitbread and Bass. Pubmaster intends
to continue its expansion to an estate extending to 3,500 pubs nationally.
