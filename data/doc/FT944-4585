FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Viag in unit merger
Viag, the diversified German energy and chemicals group, is merging its
fireproofing activities with Radex-Heraklith of Austria, Reuter reports from
Bonn.
Viag said it would acquire an 18 per cent stake in Radex, and sell the
Austrian company a 25.5 per cent stake in its fireproofing subsidiary
Didier-Werke, and then a majority stake, starting in mid-1997. It said it
was gradually withdrawing from Didier, in which it now holds 51 per cent.
