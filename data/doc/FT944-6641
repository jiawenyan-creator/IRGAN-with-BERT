FT  29 NOV 94 / Minister gives up Scottish earldom
The government's chances of securing victory in the vote on the European
Communities finance bill were boosted yesterday after a minister renounced
an earldom which he had recently inherited.
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, a junior Scottish Office minister and MP for
Edinburgh West, said that he would not adopt the title Earl of Selkirk
following the death of the 10th earl, his uncle, five days ago.
Lord James could have been barred immediately from the Commons chamber and
been unable to vote in last night's crucial division. Lord James's present
title is a courtesy title meaning he can sit as an MP. He said yesterday
that he would renounce the earldom under the provisions of the Peerage Act
1963. He had already submitted documents of disclaimer.
He said he had been unhappy to take the decision so soon, but added: 'I owe
it as a duty to my constituents whom I wish to continue to serve, and as a
matter of loyalty to the prime minister and to the Conservative party, to
support John Major in the voting lobby tonight.'
Several MPs pointed out yesterday that Lord James's decision was
particularly significant because he had a majority of just 879 over his
Liberal Democrat challenger in Edinburgh West at the last general election.
