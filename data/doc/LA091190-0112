BRIEFLY 
Chip Industry Barometer Falls: The semiconductor industry's benchmark indicator 
dipped in August to its lowest level since November. 
The San Jose-based Semiconductor Industry Assn. said the book-to-bill ratio, 
which compares orders with shipments, fell to 0.99 in August from 1 in July. A 
book-to-bill ratio of 0.99 means that for every $100 of semiconductors shipped 
to the U.S. market in the three months ended in August, chip manufacturers 
received new orders worth $99. A ratio of less than 1 is considered unhealthy 
for the industry.
