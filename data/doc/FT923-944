FT  25 SEP 92 / Letter: Subsidiarity not a recent concept
Sir, Britain's chancellor, Norman Lamont, referring to subsidiarity on the
BBC's Today programme on September 21, said '. . . that very British idea
that no one was interested in at first'.
The clarity of his assertion suggests that the chancellor may believe in its
accuracy.
May I respectfully remind him that subsidiarity has been on the periphery of
discussions on European integration for nearly 20 years. The Tindemann
report of 1976 addressed the subject (which was raised by the Commission).
In 1984 the European parliament's draft treaty on European union explicitly
included the principle of subsidiarity in its preamble and several articles.
Article 130(r)(4) of the 1986 Single European Act expressly applied the
principle without the term subsidiarity as such.
Subsidiarity was raised as early as 1988 by Jacques Delors and has been
debated ever since. It was not the UK which introduced the provision into
the Maastricht treaty.
