FT  16 JUL 93 / Quotas for diamond and gold industries
THE Russian parliament yesterday approved a law on precious metals and gems
which confirms the growing power of the regions by giving them joint control
of gold and diamond production and sales, and bans foreigners from
production.
The law passed its second reading yesterday, and is expected to win final
approval today.
The law shares the state monopoly of precious metals and gems with the
republics and regions in which they are produced, and allows production
quotas to be determined between the federal and regional authorities. It
limits the extraction of precious metals and gems to companies and citizens
of Russia.
Mr Igor Ivanov, the parliamentary deputy who drafted the law, said yesterday
the export of gold, diamonds and other gems accounted for 15 per cent of
Russia's hard currency income.
Mr Ivanov said that 'in the past no one knew how much was sold to whom and
for how much - apart from a narrow circle in the government'.
The Committee on Precious Metals must report to parliament each year. The
law has been framed so that only the regions, and not the committee itself,
can engage in the extraction and production of the precious materials.
Russia's gold reserves are officially estimated at 330 tonnes.
