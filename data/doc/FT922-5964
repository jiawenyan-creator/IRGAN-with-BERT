FT  28 MAY 92 / Businesses 'crucial to success of summit'
MR Maurice Strong, secretary-general of the Earth Summit to be held in Rio
de Janeiro next week, said yesterday the role of business was crucial to the
summit's success. Industrial efficiency was the key to a better
environmental future, he added.
Addressing the International Chamber of Commerce conference on sustainable
development, Mr Strong said that future financial profits and attention to
the environment would be closely linked.
'Those who are defensive, reluctant, fighting yesterday's battles and
believing that the movement for sustainable development is at the fringes of
events, are the businesses which will fall by the wayside,' he warned.
'In some ways industry is ahead of government, but to move on it needs
government co-operation. I hope a primary result of the Earth Summit will be
an affirmation by governments of the need for a fiscal and regulatory
environment which allows industry to operate with sustainable behaviour.'
US companies emitted 11 per cent fewer toxic chemicals in 1990 than a year
earlier, the Environmental Protection Agency said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Washington.
