</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Secretary of the Interior is announcing the approval, with certain exceptions, of proposed amendments to the
Wyoming permanent regulatory program (hereinafter, the ``Wyoming program'') under the Surface Mining Control
and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act), and the corresponding modification of the one remaining condition
of program approval. The amendments primarily address the recovery of costs and expenses, including attorney's
fees, incurred in connection with administrative review proceedings under the Wyoming program, but they also include
provisions pertaining to formal and informal administrative reviews in general, intervention in administrative
review proceedings, and the definition of toxic materials. The amendments are intended to revise the Wyoming program
to be consistent with the corresponding Federal standards and to clarify State operating procedures.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




I. Background on the Wyoming Program



On November 26, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Wyoming program. General background
information on the Wyoming program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and conditions
of approval of the Wyoming program can be found in the November 26, 1980, 

Federal Register

 (45 FR 78637). Subsequent actions concerning Wyoming's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 950.11,
950.12, 950.15, and 950.16.



II. Submission of Amendments



On March 9, 1993 (Administrative Record No. WY221), Wyoming submitted a proposed amendment comprised
of (1) Enrolled Act No. 60 (1993 General Session), which, as signed into law on March 2, 1993, revised subsection (f)
of section 3511437 of the Wyoming Statutes (W.S.) and added a new subsection (g) to this section, and
(2) a number of changes to Chapter V of the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Wyoming Department of Environmental
Quality (DEQ). Both Enrolled Act No. 60 and the regulation changes pertain solely to the award of costs and expenses
in connection with administrative and judicial proceedings under the approved State program.

The State submitted the amendment primarily to satisfy a condition the Secretary placed on the approval of the Wyoming
program at 30 CFR 950.11(c) (hereinafter, condition ``c''). This condition requires the State to amend its program
to include provisions that are consistent with the Federal regulations at 43 CFR part 4 concerning intervention in
administrative review proceedings and the recovery of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred
in connection with participation in such proceedings.

Wyoming originally promulgated Chapter V of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure on August 3, 1982, and submitted
it to OSM as a program amendment by letter dated August 18, 1982. This amendment also included a revised version of section
7 of Chapter II of the DEQ Rules of Practice and Procedure; the revisions of this chapter were intended to satisfy the
intervention portion of condition ``c.'' Wyoming had previously promulgated these rules in identical form as temporary
emergency regulations, which were submitted to OSM on May 26, 1982. After reviewing the emergency regulations, OSM
determined that they did not fully satisfy condition ``c.'' Therefore, instead of acting upon these portions of the
May 26, 1982, proposed amendment, OSM extended the deadline for Wyoming to meet the condition (47 FR 4235152,
September 27, 1982). Similarly, OSM never acted upon the corresponding portions of the August 18, 1982, submittal,
which were identical to the May 26, 1982, submittal.

The August 18, 1982, submittal also included (1) a revised definition of ``toxic materials'' at Chapter I, section
2(99) of the Rules and Regulations of DEQ's Land Quality Division (LQD), and (2) a new Chapter VI to be added to the DEQ
Rules of Practice and Procedure. The new chapter authorizes the Director of the DEQ to informally review and modify
decisions of division administrators (including the Administrator of the LQD) and establishes procedures and requirements
governing such reviews. OSM also did not act upon these portions of the proposed amendment at the time of submittal.

Because the March 9, 1993, submittal revises part of the August 18, 1982, submittal, OSM is taking this opportunity
to announce a decision on both submittals. Except for recodification of the definition of toxic materials, no changes
other than those contained in the March 9, 1993, submittal have been made in the regulations submitted on August 18,
1982. (See letter from Wyoming dated August 27, 1992 (Administrative Record No. WY222).)

OSM announced receipt of the March 9, 1993, submittal in the March 30, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 16637), and, in the same document, opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing
on the substantive adequacy of both the August 18, 1982, and the March 9, 1993, submittals. The public comment period
closed on April 29, 1993. A public hearing was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify.
