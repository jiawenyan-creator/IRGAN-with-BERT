<F P=106> [Interview with Giuliano Ferrara, minister of relations with </F>
Parliament, by Aldo De Luca in Rome on 11 May: "Ferrara 
Promises: I Will No Longer Be Reckless; Now I Will Mediate"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [De Luca] How do you 
feel as minister on the first day of the Second Republic? 
  [Ferrara] I feel, so to speak...I feel constrained, but in a 
positive way. I feel constrained to perform a role comprising 
social and institutional roles which, however, are closely 
connected with my interest in and passion for politics. 
  [De Luca] Sgarbi said you joined the government because of a 
5-percent rating. 
  [Ferrara] Well, his is a very telecentric view of the world. 
  [De Luca] Why did Berlusconi suggest this particular 
ministry 
for you? 
  [Ferrara] Actually I requested it, because here it is pure 
politics, and I consider myself an "expert," in quotation marks. 
  [De Luca] Ferrara, the champion of controversy. You said 
recently: I will argue whenever I want, however I want, and 
with whomever I want. 
  [Ferrara] Obviously, if you are paid to argue on television, 
to express your own opinions, you cannot break those rules. 
  [De Luca] Does Ferrara the minister intend to follow the 
same 
rules as Ferrara the polemicist? 
  [Ferrara] Absolutely not. I am bound by the collective 
nature of the government, so I do not intend to engage in 
polemics whenever I may feel like it, with whomever I want. That 
would be stupid. 
  [De Luca] Minister for relations with Parliament is a post 
demanding gifts as a diplomat, a mediator. Do you have these 
qualities? 
  [Ferrara] It is a question of image: People have a false 
impression of me, they believe that I am reckless. That is not 
true. I am a sensible person and I think that I am capable of 
performing the task that awaits me. 
  [De Luca] What is your assessment of the team chosen by 
Prime Minister Berlusconi? 
  [Ferrara] Good, very good. I am very pleased that the 
coalition forces are properly, and not merely symbolically, 
represented in the government. 
  [De Luca] Is it really the government of the new? 
  [Ferrara] It is the newest government that it was possible 
to 
achieve. 
  [De Luca] Does Minister Clemente Mastella, a former 
steadfast 
supporter of [former Christian Democratic Party Secretary 
Ciriaco] De Mita, represent the new, too? 
  [Ferrara] Mr. Mastella is a traditional politician from a 
traditional party, just like many others. 
  [De Luca] Does it feel uncomfortable to be in the same 
government as the postfascists? 
  [Ferrara] No. When the left-wing extremists wanted the 
dissolution of the MSI [Italian Social Movement] I was on the 
other side, because I was a moderate and a reformist. Fini's 
and Tatarella's [both National Alliance] Right is not a problem 
for me. 
  [De Luca] You are perhaps one of the public figures with the 
most nicknames: from Beau Brummel to Fattypotamous, Ghino the 
Turkey, Craxone, Extra Large. Which is your favorite? 
  [Ferrara] Fattypotamous is the friendliest one, the cutest 
one, which was given to me by my friend, Paolo Franchi of 
CORRIERE DELLA SERA, and which Giampaolo Pansa subsequently 
repeated. 
  [De Luca] Would you have preferred to be a minister in a 
government with a prime minister called Bettino Craxi? 
  [Ferrara] If I could have chosen , I would have preferred to 
be a minister with Churchill as prime minister, but I have good 
hopes that Berlusconi will bestow similar merits on the country; 
I say this, of course, with a smile, jokingly. 
  [de Luca] Will you wear your hair neater, shorter? 
  [Ferrara] No, my hair is very neat, very clean, and fine. 
Anyway, it has been like this for years.
