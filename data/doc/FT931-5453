FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Goodman Fielder advances to
ADollars 65.5m
IMPROVED performance from European operations helped Goodman Fielder, the
Australian food producer, increase earnings in the first half to December.
Despite a static result from its core baking and milling operations, Goodman
raised net profits before abnormal items by 19.3 per cent to ADollars 65.5m
(USDollars 46.7m),from ADollars 54.9m a year earlier.
Sales rose 4.8 per cent to ADollars 2.09bn, from ADollars 1.99bn. The net
profits excluded a ADollars 66.3m abnormal gain, against ADollars 22.1m, on
the sale of the Wattie's business to Heinz, the US food group.
The company's baking and milling division held pre-tax profits at ADollars
43.9m. But the European foods division raised pre-tax profits by 49 per cent
to ADollars 22.9m, including two months' trading from the newly-acquired
Wessanen businesses in the Netherlands.
The consumer foods and poultry divisions recorded falls in profits, but the
fledgling Asian unit increased profits by 58 per cent to ADollars 10.4m.
Mr Michael Nugent, chief executive, said profit margins remained under
pressure, but the result represented progress in a period of large
acquisitions and divestments. He said earnings growth would remain modest in
the short term.
