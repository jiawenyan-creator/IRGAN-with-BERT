FT  07 JAN 92 / New Zealand intervenes to prop up its currency
THE New Zealand Reserve Bank yesterday intervened to stop a sharp decline in
the value of the New Zealand dollar which has fallen by 4 per cent in the
past three weeks to trade at record lows against its trade-weighted index.
A formal statement from the central bank expressed alarm at the falling
value of the currency which it said would push domestic inflation to 3.5 per
cent by the end of the year.
The bank operates under an act of parliament which places it in charge of
monetary policy, with the aim of achieving nil to 2 per cent inflation by
1993.
The statement, with its underlying threat to tighten monetary policy if the
dollar continued to fall, appeared to do the trick, with the currency moving
into what is regarded by the Bank as an acceptable level of 54.7 US cents
compared with 52.7 US cents on Friday.
The bank was reported to be pleased with the movement, as it was keen to
avert a politically unpopular tightening of monetary policy.
The Reserve Bank was instrumental in the currency's slide when it released
official forecasts before Christmas which said inflation would be at the
lower end of its target range of between 1.5 and 3.5 per cent, which would
allow some easing of the exchange rate. It is believed the bank will not
intervene if the currency stays above 53 US cents on the trade-weighted
index.
