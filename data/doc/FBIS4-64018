  [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- The threat of leaving the 
population of the northern regions of Russia without fuel and 
food next winter has prompted the State Duma to adopt today a 
resolution "on the emergency situation linked with the 
transportation of oil products and food to the country's far 
northern regions in 1994". 
  Duma member Vladimir Goman informed the MPs during the 
deliberations on the draft of the foregoing resolution that only 
85 per cent of the needed food products, 62 per cent of the 
needed oil products, and 55 per cent of the needed consumer 
goods were delivered to the northern regions of the country by 
May 1, as compared to the volume of 1993. Only 9 per cent of 
the manufactured and technical goods, envisaged by the concluded 
agreements, were so far delivered to those regions. 
  The State Duma resolution instructs several of its 
committees 
to look into the problem of financing the delivery of food 
products to the far north and to territories enjoying the same 
status before June 6, 1994, with due account of the Russian 
Government's view, and to submit to the Duma corresponding 
proposals for the timely and full delivery of the required goods. 
  The Duma noted that the Russian Government was not 
fulfilling 
its own resolution "on changes in the mechanism of state 
financial support to the delivery of products (goods) to regions 
of the far north and to territories enjoying the same status". 
  The State Duma recommended the Council of the Federation to 
jointly approach the president in connection with the 
catastrophic situation with the delivery of vitally needed 
cargoes to the northern population.
