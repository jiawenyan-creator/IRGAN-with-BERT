WOMAN ACCUSED OF MOLESTING SONS 
A Burbank woman who directs the Glendale Bar Assn.'s Lawyer Referral Service 
has been charged with sexually molesting her three young sons. 
Kathleen Bond, 38, faces nine felony counts of child molestation that 
prosecutors say occurred between September, 1985, and last December. 
Bond, director of a nonprofit service that makes referrals for low-cost legal 
assistance, is expected to surrender April 4 for her arraignment in Burbank 
Municipal Court. 
If convicted, she could face up to 24 years in prison. 
The charges were filed last Wednesday after an investigation by Burbank police. 
Authorities were alerted in December after the eldest boy reported the alleged 
incidents to his father, Michael Bond, who is divorced from Kathleen Bond, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Collier. 
Collier said all three boys told him they had been sexually molested by their 
mother. But he said he had no physical evidence of molestation and would not 
describe what kind of acts allegedly occurred, referring to them only as 
fondling and "lewd conduct." 
Donald Klahs, who is representing Kathleen Bond, said Tuesday the allegations 
were false and attributed them to the tumultuous climate of the Bonds' divorce. 
Most of the alleged incidents reportedly occurred while Michael, 39, and 
Kathleen Bond were still married and living together. The couple separated last 
February and filed for divorce last March, court records show. 
Michael Bond, a Burbank tax attorney, initially took custody of the two oldest 
boys and the youngest stayed with his mother. But the third child was turned 
over to his father's care in December after police began investigating the 
alleged molestations, according to court records.
