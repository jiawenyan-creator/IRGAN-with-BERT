FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: All-round growth lifts Denmans
Denmans Electrical attributed the 33 per cent expansion in annual profits,
announced yesterday, to an all-round improvement across its market areas.
On turnover ahead 7 per cent to Pounds 38.4m, pre-tax profits for the 12
months to end-September jumped from Pounds 1.52m to Pounds 2.03m. Mr Arnold
Denman, chairman, said the sales increase 'represented real growth in a flat
market with no price inflation'.
The shares were marked 55p higher at 528p.
The wholesale operation, expanded since the year-end to 45 branches with the
acquisition of Palmer Riley, made progress amid 'signs that the long
recession in the electrical wholesale market is now ending.'
A proposed final dividend of 4.5p brings the total for year to 6.4p (6.1p),
payable from earnings of 30.74p (23.73p) per share.
