FT  21 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: Markets offered Thanksgiving breather -
Currencies
Foreign exchange markets face a fairly quiet week, with the US enjoying only
two full trading days owing to the Thanksgiving break.
This follows a week in which a deluge of data, combined with a monetary
tighting from the Fed, failed to generate any significant movement in the
dollar.
This week the main policy event will be the Bundesbank council meeting on
Thursday. For some time now the German central bank has been scrupulous in
its efforts not to give markets a hint on the likely future direction of
interest rates. That said, few observers are expecting an imminent rise in
rates. A maintenance of the status quo - the discount rate at 4.5 per cent,
and the repo rate at 4.85 per cent - seems the most likely outcome.
The background to the council meeting will be provided by M3 money supply,
and consumer price inflation figures. The lack of data will not stop the
market from pursuing its current pre-occupation; namely, whether the dollar
is now in a bull-phase, or merely seeing a retracement within an ongoing
bear phase.
The dollar's response to the 75 basis point rise in short term rates was
strangely subdued. The dollar finished in London on Friday around DM1.5550
and Y98.60, almost exactly the levels at which it stood half an hour after
the Fed announced higher rates.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, commented:
'The dollar has made useful headway in recent weeks. But the move has simply
broken the downtrend - it is premature to say that a new bull market is in
place.'
A survey conducted on November 17 by IDEA, the financial analysis group,
illustrates that the market remains very unsure about the outlook for the
dollar. Asked to forecast two months ahead, respondents predicted median
values for the dollar of DM1.57 and Y99. Forecasts ranged, however, from
DM1.44 to DM1.6425, and Y92.50 to Y105.
