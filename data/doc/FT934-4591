FT  03 DEC 93 / Keating seeks to end Mahathir row
Mr Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, yesterday sought to end the row
between Australia and Malaysia, by writing to Dr Mahathir Mohamad saying his
recent description of the Malaysian leader as 'recalcitrant' was not
calculated to give offence, Nikki Tait writes from Sydney.
Mr Keating made his remarks in response to questions about Dr Mahathir's
non-appearance at the recent Apec leaders' summit in Seattle. Since then,
the affair has got worse. Last weekend, Malaysia banned Australian
television programmes and commercials; this week, it stopped future
government scholarship holders from going to Australia.
