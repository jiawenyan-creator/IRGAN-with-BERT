  [Text] The agreements to be signed during Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia have practically been 
finalized, Georgia's ambassador to Russia said. 
  Valerian Advadze told INTERFAX that Georgian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Mikhail Ukleba, who has arrived in Moscow with Prime 
Minister Otar Patsatsia, would stay in the Russian capital to 
clarify whatever unclear points might remain in the agreements. 
  According to well-informed sources, Patsatsia, whose visit 
ended on Friday, and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
gave consideration to 19 documents to be signed during Yeltsin's 
visit, scheduled for February 3-4. 
  The documents include a treaty of friendship and 
cooperation, 
agreements on trade and economic cooperation for 1994, free 
trade, the status of Russian border troops in Georgia, transport 
cooperation, water transport of cargo, and scientific and 
technological cooperation. 
  The two prime ministers also discussed the possibility of 
Russia extending its last year's credit to Georgia for this year 
and providing a new credit in addition to it, and of Russia's 
assistance in rebuilding Georgia's Black Sea ports of Poti and 
Batumi. 
  Ambassador Advadze said Georgia had asked Russia for credits 
worth tens of billions of rubles. Chernomyrdin "paid very 
serious attention to our problems, but couldn't give us a final 
answer because the budget hasn't yet been approved in Russia," 
Advadze said. 
  The ambassador said Georgia mainly needed the credits to 
keep 
its fuel and energy complex going, in particular to buy natural 
gas, residual fuel oil, gasolene, etc. Georgia imports up to 80 
percent of its energy, he said.
