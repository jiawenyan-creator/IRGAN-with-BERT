MAN STABBED DURING FIGHT OVER VAN 
A newspaper delivery man making his rounds Monday stabbed a man who was trying 
to steal his van in the Pacific Beach area, San Diego police said. 
Police said Robert McGee, a newspaper carrier for the San Diego Union, was 
delivering his papers about 6:35 a.m. in the 1300 block of Thomas Avenue and 
had momentarily left the van unattended with its engine running. 
As McGee, 47, returned to the van, a man climbed inside and began driving away, 
police said. McGee jumped in front of the van three times, finally forcing the 
van to roll to a stop, they said. 
A fight then broke out in the street, and McGee stabbed the man in the back 
with a knife, police said. Although it was unclear who owned the knife, police 
said McGee acted in self-defense during the fight. 
The wounded man, Daniel Hernandez, 31, was listed in fair condition at Scripps 
Memorial Hospital in La Jolla. Police said he was booked on suspicion of auto 
theft.
