  [Excerpt] Supreme Court Chairman Luis Serpa Segura told 
Italian prosecutor Vittorio Paraggio during a meeting held in 
the past few days that Peruvian justice has issued a national 
arrest warrant against former President Alan Garcia Perez. 
  This was reported by congressman Fernando Olivera, a member 
of the congressional committee investigating the fraud case of 
the Lima subway's construction. The committee members met last 
week with the Italian prosecutors visiting Peru to investigate 
the case, who returned to Italy on 20 March. 
  The arrest order, however, has not been transmitted yet to 
Interpol, Olivera said. "I have talked with the Interpol 
representative in Peru and he told me he was not informed by the 
judicial branch about the arrest warrant," he said. 
  Olivera demanded that the Supreme Court immediately transmit 
the arrest order to Interpol in order "to prevent Alan Garcia 
from continuing to flout the law and stay abroad as if he were 
not sought in Peru." [passage omitted]
