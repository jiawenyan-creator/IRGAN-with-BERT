  [Text] Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi has stated that the results of 
the meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton do not constitute a positive 
indication for returning to the negotiating table. Dr. 'Ashrawi 
made these remarks in an exclusive interview with our 
correspondent Kayid Zahir: 
  [Begin recording] ['Ashrawi] In fact, the outcome was what 
we had expected. It was a U.S. attempt to support the Israeli 
position without moving in a practical and effective manner to 
change the situation on the ground. Clearly, the Israeli 
position dominated the Clinton-Rabin summit. The practical 
steps about which President Clinton talked in a general manner 
have not been worked out so far and there are no indications 
that those steps will be translated in practice on the ground. 
  [Zahir] Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, does the Palestinian side 
support the idea of introducing Palestinian police into Hebron? 
  ['Ashrawi] As we have heard, this is a Palestinian stance by 
the Palestinian leadership. Perhaps with the introduction or 
movement of Palestinian security forces into these areas some 
security will be established, but as we know there is a dual 
law, there is the possibility of settlers using weapons, and 
there is a tense and explosive situation. I do not believe that 
the Palestinian police alone can maintain security and 
stability, but this is a step in the right direction. 
  [Zahir] A step in the right direction despite the fact that 
sovereignty will remain an Israeli sovereignty under the Israeli 
Defense Forces authorities? 
  ['Ashrawi] There cannot be a Palestinian police force or 
security forces bound by an Israeli decision, especially as in 
the accord there are issues relating to the Palestinian police 
and security forces. I do not believe security will be 
established by increasing the Palestinian police, Palestinian 
security forces, or other forces. Security is established by 
addressing the causes of the conflict and the explosion. It is 
clear that the Israeli settlement presence is the main cause of 
instability. 
  [Zahir] What do you think of the Palestinians' boycott of 
the Israeli commission of inquiry? 
  ['Ashrawi] I support the presentation of Palestinian 
evidence before this commission, before any other commissions, 
and before the media and public opinion because the revelation 
of facts is in our interest. We always work publicly and 
overtly and in order to reach the truth, because anyone who 
possesses information cannot benefit from it if that information 
remains with him. This information must be revealed. In my 
opinion, going before this commission is a positive thing. 
  [Zahir] Dr. Hanan, despite the statement by the Supreme 
Islamic Council to boycott this commission? 
  ['Ashrawi] This is a decision by the Supreme Islamic Council 
and we respect their decision, but that does not prevent me from 
expressing my own private opinion. I am expressing my own 
personal view. 
  [Zahir] Maybe there have been Jordanian instructions to the 
Awqaf in East Jerusalem? 
  ['Ashrawi] In my opinion, the decision must be a Palestinian 
one and related to Palestinian interests. Dealing with facts 
responsibly and publicly is fundamental and one must act 
accordingly. [end recording]
