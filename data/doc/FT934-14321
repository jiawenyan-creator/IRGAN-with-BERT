FT  18 OCT 93 / Cosatu's strike call snubs ANC
THE Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the country's largest
union grouping, has called a national strike for November 15 to protest
against the treatment of workers' rights in the draft constitution, writes
Philip Gawith in Johannesburg.
Its call surprised political observers as it did not appear to have been
discussed with Cosatu's partners, the African National Congress (ANC) and
South African Communist party. It would seem to indicate a determination by
Cosatu to continue as an independent voice for workers regardless of its
political ties.
The group called on negotiators at democracy talks to remove a clause in the
constitution guaranteeing the tenure of civil servants after the election
next April, and strike out a clause from the interim bill of rights enabling
employers to lock out striking workers.
