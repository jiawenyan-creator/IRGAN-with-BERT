  [Text] Seoul, April 27 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
plans to carry out a limited cabinet reshuffle as soon as the 
National Assembly approves the appointment of Yi Yong-tok as 
prime minister Thursday, sources said Wednesday. 
  There is a strong possibility that Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu may be picked to succeed Yi as deputy prime minister 
and minister of the National Unification Board (NUB), the 
sources said. 
  The ambassador to the United Nations, Yu Chong-ha, is being 
mentioned to replace Han as foreign minister, they added. 
  The limited cabinet shake-up will be performed by the 
president in consultation with the new prime minister. 
  "The appointment of the NUB minister will be made in the 
context of maintaining a consistent diplomatic and national 
security policy," said one source. "Consequently, the elevation 
of foreign minister Han to the deputy premiership is being 
studied since he had been in charge of the government's policy 
on the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  "As for Han's successor, I understand that (President Kim) 
plans to pick a career diplomat," he said. "Ambassador Yu 
follows the same line of thinking as Minister Han on the nuclear 
problem."
