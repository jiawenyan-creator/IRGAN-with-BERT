NAMES IN THE NEWS; 
CUT SPEAKING, KITTY DUKAKIS TOLD 
Kitty Dukakis' doctors have advised her not to discuss her addiction problems 
in her public appearances. 
"Her therapist and she agree that it is critical that she not be so upfront 
about her problems. It appears that her speaking might be over. Or very 
limited." The Massachusetts first lady recently returned home from an 
alcoholism treatment center and Tuesday night, in one of her first public 
appearances since returning home, she joined her husband, Gov. Michael S. 
Dukakis, at a ceremony formally forging a sister state relationship between 
Massachusetts and the Japanese state of Hokkaido. She also has resumed work on 
her memoirs, "Now I Know."
