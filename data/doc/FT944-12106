FT  03 NOV 94 / Rangoon disappoints US envoy
The most senior US delegation to visit Burma in six years left Rangoon
yesterday without any apparent promise of significant political reforms from
the country's military rulers. Mr Thomas Hubbard, US deputy assistant
secretary of state, said after the two-day visit that moves by the junta
towards political reconciliation would improve US-Burmese relations, but
failure to make progress 'would lead to further restrictions on our
political and economic ties'. Mr Hubbard held talks with Lt Gen Khin Nyunt,
head of military intelligence. The visit follows two meetings between Gen
Khin Nyunt and Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the democracy campaigner under house
arrest in Rangoon for over five years.
