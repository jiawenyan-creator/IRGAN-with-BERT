DINNER TO HONOR DOMINGUEZ RANCH ADOBE CURATOR 
Father Patrick McPolin, curator since 1974 of the Dominguez Ranch Adobe, will 
be honored at a $100-a-plate testimonial dinner and celebrity show Sunday by 
the Dominguez-Carson chapter of Rotary Club. The event will be held at the 
Carson Community Center and will headline entertainers Danny Thomas and Vikki 
Carr. Proceeds will be used to repair structural damage to the adobe. 
The adobe, designated a historical state and national landmark, is at 18137 S. 
Alameda St., Compton, on property that was once part of a 75,000-acre rancho 
founded by Juan Jose Dominguez. 
The Dominguez Ranch Adobe was built by Manuel Dominguez, who inherited the 
property from his uncle in 1826. The adobe was owned by the Dominguez family 
until 1922, when it was given to the Claretian missionaries. Father Pat, as 
McPolin is known, came to the adobe in 1936 as a student of the Claretian 
seminary. When the school closed in 1974, he took charge of the house's 
restoration. 
Tickets for the dinner are available by calling 834-2626.
