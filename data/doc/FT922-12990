FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: Primerica lifts earnings to
Dollars 153.9m
RECORD earnings from its Smith Barney securities broking subsidiary helped
Primerica, the US financial services group, yesterday report a 45 per cent
increase in first-quarter operating profits to Dollars 153.9m.
Total income for the period, however, was Dollars 220.8m, because the group
reaped Dollars 66.9m in net gains from the sale of stock in Inter-Regional
Financial, Musicland and Margaretten, the group's former mortgage banking
subsidiary sold in a public offering in January.
Smith Barney was again the star performer in the Primerica stable, riding
another buoyant quarter for Wall Street and domestic stock markets to record
profits of Dollars 56.1m, almost double the Dollars 29.3m the broking house
earned a year earlier.
Revenues were up from all of Smith Barney's main business lines, a
reflection of strong market participation by individual as well as
institutional investors, extremely high levels of new issue offerings and a
solid increase in assets under management.
Only principal trading, where revenues rose just 5 per cent, failed to match
the record pace set by the rest of the company.
