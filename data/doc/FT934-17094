FT  02 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Individual stories move shares
INDIVIDUAL stories moved share prices yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS featured interest in Rhone-Poulenc, down FFr5.00 at FFr159.50, after
the group announced that it was to buy out the outstanding minorities in its
51 per cent owned pharmaceuticals subsidiary, Institut Merieux.
Mr Michael Woodcock, French analyst at Nikko Europe, commented that while
this was a positive move for Rhone-Poulenc, reinforcing its position in the
health care sector, the increase of some 18 per cent of its equity in the
process was likely to be mildly dilutive.
He added that the group's position in the privatisation timetable, currently
second to BNP, could be jeopardised because of the new share issue.
The CAC-40 index rose 2.09 to 2,116.72, up 1.1 per cent on the week, in a
session interrupted by technical problems.
FRANKFURT closed the week with the gains it achieved on Monday, the DAX
index falling 3.62 to 1,912.09 on the session, a five-day rise of 1.4 per
cent. Turnover fell from DM5.1bn to DM4.4bn.
However, prices picked up in the post-bourse, the Ibis-indicated DAX index
closing the afternoon at 1,920.69.
Hopes of more encouraging money supply indications for September were one
reason, and Wall Street's early performance gave dealers another excuse for
a general mark-up.
Specific news in the afternoon included Lufthansa's confirmation that it had
reached a co-operation agreement with a US air carrier, thought last night
to be United Airlines, after a lengthy search. In the post-bourse, the
shares were quoted up to DM4 higher than their official, DM1612 close.
ZURICH edged ahead in cautious trading, the SMI index adding 8.5 to 2,481.6,
or 1.5 per cent higher on the week.
Institutional selling left SMH SFr18.50 or 8 per cent lower at SFr212, after
the watchmaker warned that poor Christmas sales would leave profits flat for
the year.
Swissair, a cumulative 13.8 per cent lower during September, picked up SFr20
or 3 per cent to SFr675 after the latest Alcazar announcement.
However, Mr Roland Leutenegger of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich noted that the
statement contained little that was new and he suggested that the rise was a
technical reaction to the recent fall.
Swiss Re rose SFr5 to SFr3,320 ahead of its 1992 results, announced after
the bourse closed.
In the event, a 5.6 per cent rise in group net profit for 1992 was in line
with expectations, said Mr Kishore Banger of James Capel, who expects
earnings growth averaging 24 per cent a year during the next three years.
Schindler added SFr90 to SFr6,190 as it forecast a rise of at least 10 per
cent in 1993 group net profit.
AMSTERDAM saw a strong rise in KLM, founded on news that progress had been
made in talks between European airlines over the Alcazar link-up, the shares
rising Fl 1.90 or 5 per cent to Fl 37.00.
The CBS Tendency index closed up 0.7 at 125.2, up 1.1 per cent on the week.
Nedlloyd retreated a further Fl 1.00 to Fl 39.20, after a 70 cents loss on
Thursday. The transport group has seen consistent selling in recent days and
has fallen some 19 per cent in value since reaching a year's high on
September 3.
MILAN gave ground, as profits were taken in the telecommunications sector
after the sharp rises over recent months. The Comit index slipped 1.72 to
594.31 for a 1.3 per cent rise over the week.
Stet, the holding company shed L54 to L4,320 while Sip, the domestic
telephone operator was L35 lower at L3,688.
Fiat continued to pick up some of Wednesday's losses, rising L90 to L5,790:
Rinascente remained suspended, with analysts becoming increasingly impatient
for more information about its disposal.
CSFB said it was maintaining its buy recommendation on Ifil, which also
continued suspended.
Montedison, L21 higher at L765, attracted speculative interest rose
following its announcement of improved operating profits; Ferruzzi rose L8
to L324.
On the opposite tack, Italcementi shed L230 to L9,260 after it revealed that
production fell 20.1 per cent in the first half.
VIENNA's ATX index gained 5.81 to 968.68, but Austrian Airlines fell Sch40
to Sch1,810 after saying that it would not make a decision on co-operation
until mid-October, in spite of comments from its potential Alcazar partner,
Swissair, that a deal was near.
OSLO's North Sea oil stocks pushed the bourse higher after an erratic week,
optimism here after Opec nations agreed to curb output making up for a mixed
performance elsewhere. The all-share index ended 2.81 firmer at 547.64, up
0.5 per cent on the week, in turnover of NKr453m.
ISTANBUL moved into positive territory once again after two days of declines
as investors took profits.
The composite index rose 872.7 or 5.8 per cent to 15,952.4, for a gain of 6
per cent on the week. Turnover was estimated at TL1,070bn.
Renewed interest in equities has emerged following a slight easing in
interest rates this week and expectations that further cuts are likely in
the near future. Eregli rose TL350 or 8.7 per cent to TL4,350.
