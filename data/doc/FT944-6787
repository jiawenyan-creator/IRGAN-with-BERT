FT  28 NOV 94 / International Company News: Minmet in IPounds 630,000 rights
and placing
Minmet, the Dublin-based electronic information, mining and exploration
group, is raising IPounds 630,000 (Pounds 620,811) through a 1-for-6 rights
issue and the placing of up to 5m new shares at 2.5p per share.
The new funds will be invested in Russia Money, an on-screen information
service joint venture, Solent Trees, a mature trees business, and the
group's Russian gold interests.
The group is also negotiating with Gulf Explorations Consultants, a US shell
company in which Minmet has a 23.8 per cent stake, a possible paper bid for
Minmet by Gulf.
Mr Paul Bristol, chairman of Minmet, said that if a Gulf bid were accepted
by Minmet's shareholders, the new entity would seek to revive its listing on
Nasdaq, which may be considered a more suitable market than Dublin for
raising funds for Russia Money and the group's Russian gold mining
operations.
Mr Bristol said he hoped the negotiations with Gulf would be completed
before the December 18 deadline for the rights issue.
Shares in Minmet closed unchanged at 2 3/4 p on Friday.
