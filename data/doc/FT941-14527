FT  20 JAN 94 / MoD widens scope for deal at Swans
The Ministry of Defence would be in a position to award a contract to Swan
Hunter, the stricken Tyneside shipyard, if a potential purchaser was willing
to underwrite the bid, it emerged yesterday.
Since Swans went into receivership in May the MoD has said the yard can
tender for orders, but an award can be made only if it is on a sound
financial footing.
It became apparent yesterday, however, that a potential bidder would have
the option of backing a bid for an order before committing itself to buying
the yard.
Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne East, spoke after a meeting
yesterday with defence procurement minister Mr Jonathan Aitken. He said the
minister had confirmed that if a potential purchaser was willing to offer
guarantees, it would be possible for the MoD to place a contract with the
yard.
Mr Brown said: 'This gives the company the chance to make the transition
from receivership to private ownership on the back of an award of a contract
from the MoD.'
Swan Hunter's remaining 1,080 employees are fitting out its last orders  -
two Type 23 frigates. The company's sale prospects could be greatly enhanced
if it could win the Pounds 30m refit of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary supply
vessel Sir Bedivere, for which the MoD has invited tenders.
Mr Ed James of receivers Price Waterhouse welcomed the suggestion that
potential purchasers' involvement could help win MoD orders. But he added:
'The receivers still believe they will only gain work from the MoD if the
yard is financially stable, and that means finding a buyer.'
