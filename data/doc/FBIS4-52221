  [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il sent a centenary birthday table to Kim Chang-yong 
residing in Onchon-up, Onchon County, South Pyongan Province. 
The birthday table was conveyed to her on May 6. 
  Born into a poor peasant family in the declining days of the 
feudal society of the ri dynasty, she was subjected to all sorts 
of hard toil under the Japanese imperialist colonial rule. 
  It was not until the liberation of the country that she 
could 
enjoy a life worthy of human being under the DPRK Government. 
During the fatherland liberation war she took an active part in 
the struggle for wartime food grain production and aided the 
People's Army both materially and morally. In the postwar 
period, too, she did her everything for the prosperity of the 
socialist homeland. 
  Now, she has a big family of more than 30. 
  In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today the 
number 
of those who enjoy longevity is on a steady increase thanks to 
popular policies.
