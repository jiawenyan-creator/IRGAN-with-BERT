FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Border TV improves to Pounds 802,000
Border TV, the USM-quoted ITV licensee for the Border region, lifted pre-tax
profits from Pounds 519,000 to Pounds 802,000 for the six months to October
31. The shares closed 12p higher at 150p.
The result was on reduced turnover of Pounds 4.85m (Pounds 5.9m) but the
company said that comparisons were not meaningful as it no longer sold
airtime for Channel 4.
Earnings per share nearly doubled to 6.7p (3.4p) and the interim dividend is
raised to 1.6p (1.3p).
