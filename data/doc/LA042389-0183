WESTMINSTER VIETNAMESE AND FORMER CIA CHIEF 
I was deeply incensed by Councilman Frank Fry's remark about the South 
Vietnamese. The cultural diversity that surrounds me in Orange County is 
something that I cherish. I live next to Little Saigon and I delight in its 
differentness, just as I do in other areas of the county that house other races 
and ethnic groups. 
When I am allowed to participate in a ceremony or event such as the Tet 
Festival, which I enjoyed, I am given the chance to glimpse a part of our large 
world. Fry's desire for a community of homogenized clones would lead to a 
bleak, monotonous life.
