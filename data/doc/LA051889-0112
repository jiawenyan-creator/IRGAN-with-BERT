A Senate panel approved a uniform poll-closing time of 10 p.m. EST for 
presidential elections in an effort to end network projections of results 
before all voters have cast their ballots. "I believe early projections before 
the polls close threaten the right of some voters to go to the polls and feel 
their votes count," said Sen. Brock Adams (D-Wash.) after the 9-2 vote by the 
Senate Rules and Administration Committee. The poll-closing bill was approved 
as part of a package of unrelated measures, including a blueprint for having 
eight regional presidential primaries around the country with the Federal 
Election Commission determining the order of the events by lot.
