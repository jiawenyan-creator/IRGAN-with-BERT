FT  29 DEC 93 / Chilean finance minister named
The task of maintaining Chile's impressive economic record will go to Mr
Eduardo Aninat following his appointment as finance minister in the cabinet
of president-elect Eduardo Frei, due to take over next March, writes David
Pilling from Santiago.
Mr Aninat, 45, who will replace the much-praised Mr Alejandro Foxley, was
Chile's chief debt negotiator until March 1991 when he returned to his
private economic consultancy.
