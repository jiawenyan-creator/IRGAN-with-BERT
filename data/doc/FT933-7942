FT  18 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Wide variations in senior
bourse performance
SENIOR bourses saw wide variations in performance, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS, closed for a holiday on Monday, lost ground on disappointment that
while the Bank of France eased its 24 hour lending rate, it left the
intervention rate unchanged.
The CAC-40 index shed 11.71 to 2,136.29 as turnover drifted back from
FFr3.6bn to FFr2.9bn. Mr Michael Woodcock at Nikko Europe said that equities
were discounting a sharp fall in interest rates and 'a speedy resumption of
economic growth'. A period of consolidation could be expected, he said,
warning that 'disappointing company earnings figures should emphasise. . .
the seriousness of the current economic downturn'.
Euro Disney reacted to last week's news of a fall in third quarter revenues,
the shares slipping FFr4.45 or 6.8 per cent to FFr60.80. Peugeot lost FFr4
to FFr693, having announced that it was to suspend production of its 405
model in the UK.
FRANKFURT's DAX index eased 2.02 to 1910.17 after an intraday low of
1895.77. Turnover rose from DM7.8bn to DM8.2bn.
Siemens consolidated, rising 30 pfg to DM684.90; it emerged that Monday's
DM8.60 gain followed an upgrade from 'long term buy' to 'buy' from DB
Research whose analyst, Mr Sonke Papenhausen, said that improving chip
demand had led to a 15 per cent increase in selling prices since last
October.
Its subsidiary, AEG, rose DM5.20 to DM173.50 on its leading role in a
Siemens-led consortium which has won a DM2.2bn high-speed train contract
from Germany's railroad authorities.
In retailing, Asko dropped DM55 to DM745 on its bid for Massa, which
reflected the terms and rose DM12 to DM184. In chemicals and metals, Degussa
fell DM11.50 to DM371.50 on a drop in half year profits; and, reflecting
hopes in mobile telecommunications, Mannesmann rose DM5.50 to DM335.50 on
the AT&amp;T bid for McCaw Cellular Communications in the US.
MADRID accelerated late on US buying, the general index closing 5.64 higher
at 286.86 for a gain of 5.9 per cent over the past five sessions. Turnover
climbed again, from Pta25.6bn to Pta26.7bn.
The buying made its impact more obviously, but not exclusively on the
relatively illiquid construction sector, where Cubiertas rose Pta540 to
Pta8,390, FCC by Pta990 to Pta14,390 and Valderivvas by Pta430 to Pta9,400.
In utilities, Gas Natural ended Pta520 higher at Pta9,200 and, among
US-traded blue chips, Telefonica rose Pta65 to Pta1,505.
ZURICH tried again to ignore bearish noises from London, the SMI index
hitting a high of 2,291 early in the day, but it subsided later to close
14.1 lower at 2,464.8.
There was some nervousness in advance of today's first half results from
Credit Suisse; its parent, CS Holding, fell SFr40 to SFr2,825. Cyclicals saw
profit-taking but closed above earlier lows, Alusuisse bearers ending SFr14
down at SFr558 after SFr548.
AMSTERDAM saw some switching out of cyclicals into defensive stocks as the
CBS Tendency index lost 1.2 to 126.7.
Among the gainers on the day, Unilever added Fl 2.30 to Fl 195.70 and
Elsevier Fl 3.60 to Fl 137.40. Williams de Broe in London upgraded the stock
yesterday, and commented that the group's long-term profitability would be
helped by cost cutting, product development and geographic expansion in
Asia, Latin America and east Europe.
Hunter Douglas fell Fl 3.70 or 6 per cent to FL 59.20; it reported a 16 per
cent gain in first half profits after the close.
STOCKHOLM was given a boost by SE Banken first half results which came in at
the top end of expectations. The bank also announced a SKr5bn rights issue
and said that it had withdrawn an application for state assistance. The A
shares advanced SKr9.50 to SKr78.50. The Affarsvarlden general index put on
16.9 to 1,301.9.in turnover of SKr1.5bn.
Mr David Longmuir of James Capel said that the results had given the market
a shot in the arm. He added that the bank was now solidly capitalised even
although it might not be profitable for some time to come.
Attention would now turn, he said, to forthcoming results due out from
Electrolux today, Ericsson on Thursday, Investor on Friday and
Handelsbanken, Stora and Sandvik in the next week. Surprises were unlikely,
he said, but any less than positive comments could see some profit-taking.
MILAN was lifted by a broker's positive rerating of Generali, which gained
L1,505 or 4.7 per cent to L41,000, the Comit index putting on 15.21 or 2.5
per cent to 608.25.
However, Mr Marco Ortelli of brokers Akros Sim in Milan said that while the
Comit index has risen by some 20 per cent since mid-June, there were no
fundamental reasons behind the upswing.
Fiat and Olivetti were cases in point, he noted, the former adding another
L285 to L7,415 yesterday, in spite of recent figures showing a 30 per cent
decline in domestic car sales. Olivetti was up L43 at L2,168.
The cement and construction sector was another good performer on the day,
with Italcementi gaining L660 or 5.6 per cent to L12,475.
