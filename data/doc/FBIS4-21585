  [Text] Before the forthcoming parliamentary elections in 
Ukraine, several important parties there are demanding that, 
despite previous agreements, the country should retain some of 
its nuclear weapons. "The Echo" program correspondent Kjell 
Albin Abrahamson reports from Ukraine. 
  Abrahamson: Today Yeltsin is governing Russia, but 
tomorrow Zhirinovskiy may come to power. Today President 
Clinton is supporting Ukraine, but we know nothing about the 
next U.S. President. This was said by Ukrainian General 
(Oleksandr Rul), who will stand as a candidate of the 
super-nationalist Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists in the 
parliamentary elections. He now sees nationalism and nuclear 
weapons as the best guarantee for an independent and sovereign 
Ukraine. 
  Most political parties here share that view, including the 
Republican Party -- an offshoot of the dissident movement -- and 
the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, which want Ukraine to 
retain some of its nearly 1,800 nuclear warheads. General (Rul) 
points out: It is us, not you who are in the immediate 
frontline in the event of a Russian attack.
