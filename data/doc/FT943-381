FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Examiner for Aer Lingus arm
Aer Lingus, the Irish Republic's national airline, has put Team Aer Lingus,
its aircraft maintenance subsidiary, into examinership, the equivalent of
administration under Irish law.
The appointment of an examiner to the company which employs 1,800 people,
1,200 of whom have been laid off already, follows the breakdown of
negotiations between management and trade unions on restructuring.
Team Aer Lingus provides line maintenance for the Aer Lingus fleet but the
bulk of its business comes from aircraft overhaul work for other airlines.
The dispute is over the introduction of new work practices.
Team has accumulated losses of almost IPounds 58.5m (Pounds 57.8m) and a
deficit in its balance sheet of IPounds 18.3m. The failure of the
examinership process would almost certainly result in its liquidation
leading to the calling in of IPounds 22.8m of loans to Team guaranteed by
Aer Lingus. Team also owes IPounds 41.6m to its parent.
The examiner has three weeks in which to report to the Irish high court on
whether he believes a survival plan can be worked out.
