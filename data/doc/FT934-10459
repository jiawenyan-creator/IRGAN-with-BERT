FT  05 NOV 93 / Rule on ITV takeovers may soften
THE GOVERNMENT is mov-ing towards a modest relaxation of the rules
preventing the nine largest ITV companies taking each other over.
A compromise is taking shape after an inter-ministerial meeting this week.
It would allow a large ITV company to own a second 'large' licence.
The National Heritage Department is to send proposals to Mr John Major, the
prime minister, for a final decision. The proposals are expected to reflect
the growing view that some consolidation in the ITV system is needed if UK
commercial broadcasters are to compete internationally.
An extension of the 'moratorium' which makes takeover of ITV companies
difficult before the beginning of next year is now considered unlikely. An
extension would require primary legislation.
Any liberalisation is expected to be carefully framed and will almost
certainly exclude Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Ian Lang,
Scottish secretary, and Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, have both
expressed concern about the continuation of regional production if Scottish
and Welsh commercial broadcasters were to be taken over.
It is also unlikely that a single company will be allowed to own both the
London weekday and weekend licences.
There remains scope for modest consolidation which would, for example, allow
Granada to take over London Weekend Television, a company in which it
already has a stake. In such a scenario Carlton Communications, owners of
Carlton Television, could take over Anglia. Carlton, holders of the London
weekday licence, already has a 20 per cent stake in Central, the second
largest ITV company.
The National Heritage Department said last night that no final decisions had
been taken. If compromise proposals are accepted then they would have to be
passed by both houses of parliament.
Supporters of liberalisation stress that existing licence obligations on
regional programmes and production would have to be met by new owners.
