  [Text] Answering a question asked by a correspondent of 
Radio Romania "Current Events Program" in connection with 
certain remarks that [Moldovan Prime Minister] Andrei Sangheli 
made about the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Romania in an 
interview that he granted to ITAR-TASS, Mircea Geoana, spokesman 
for the Romanian Foreign Ministry, said the following: 
  Romania is the state that supported from the very first 
moment and continues to support with greatest conviction the 
abilities, independence, and statehood of the Republic of 
Moldova. I do not wish to comment on the passages in which 
ideas from the recent speech made by President Snegur are 
repeated, because the viewpoints of the Bucharest authorities 
about that speech have already been presented. 
  As regards the need to consult all Romanians in case the 
issue of reunification of the two Romanian states becomes 
topical, to which Mr. Sangheli is referring, we believe that our 
position has not been correctly understood. If, at one point, 
this issue might come up, I believe that apart from the act of 
consulting the Romanians from the Republic of Moldova, it is 
absolutely necessary to consult the Romanians in Romania, that 
is, to find out the opinion of all Romanians. We do not see 
anything offensive in these affirmations, but only an act of 
expressing certain obvious democratic and political facts, said 
Mr. Mircea Geoana to our radio station.
