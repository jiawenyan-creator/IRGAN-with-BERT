FT  21 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Australia sole issuer with ADollars
100m offering
TURBULENT conditions in most European government bond markets kept potential
Eurobond issuers on the sidelines yesterday, with underwriting firms
anticipating only a few new offerings this week.
The only issue of the day came from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia,
which launched a ADollars 100m eight-year issue targeted at retail
investors. The 8 3/4 per cent bonds were priced at 101 and traded down to
less 1.85 bid by late afternoon, comfortably inside full fees of 2 per cent.
The Australian, Canadian and US dollar sectors are most likely to see new
issues this week if European markets remain volatile. However, interest
rates and currency swaps opportunities are poor.
One potential area for new issues is in the Ecu bond market, where interest
rate swap spreads moved sharply yesterday, allowing potential issuers to
achieve cheaper floating-rate funding.
Today, the Bank of England will auction Ecu500m three-year Treasury notes,
part of an established programme. Dealers said the move in swaps spreads
indicated that investors were selling the market short ahead of the auction.
However, while attractive swaps spreads may draw potential borrowers, short
selling also depressed secondary market prices yesterday. The 8 1/2 per cent
French government Ecu bond closed almost a point down on the day at 94.55,
for a yield of 9.37 per cent. At the start of last week the yield was 8.95
per cent. Against this background, underwriters are likely to remain
cautious about bringing new issues.
Last week's issues by Gefco and the Australian state of Victoria suggested
that the appetite for sterling bonds remains buoyant.
