United States of America, Plaintiff, v. Electronic Payment Services, Inc., Defendant; Filed August 15, 1994; Civ.
No. 94208


Comments Relating to Proposed Final Judgment and Response of United States to Comments


Pursuant to the requirements of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)(h), the
United States hereby files comments it has received relating to the proposed Final Judgment in this civil antitrust
proceeding, and herein responds to those comments.
This action commenced on April 21, 1994, when the United States filed a Complaint alleging that an anticompetitive
practice of defendant Electronic Payment Services, Inc. (``EPS'') constituted a tying arrangement that was per
se unlawful under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1, and that constituted a means whereby EPS unlawfully
had maintained a monopoly in access to regional automatic teller machine (``ATM'') networks in the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania and the States of New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia and New Hampshire, and in substantial portions
of the State of Ohio (collectively the ``affected states''), all in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.
2. The United States simultaneously filed a proposed Final Judgment, a Competitive Impact Statement and a
Stipulation signed by the parties consenting to entry of the Final Judgment.
The sixty-day waiting period provided for by 15 U.S.C. 16(b) for submission of public comments expired on July
11, 1994. The United States received comments from Cash Station, Inc. (``Cash Station''), Chemical Banking Corporation
(``Chemical Bank''), Citicorp Credit Services, Inc. (``Citicorp''), William R. Kennedy, Meridian Bancorp, Inc.
(``Meridian''), Midwest Payment Systems, Inc. (``MPS''), Money Station, Inc. (``Money Station''), and The New
York Switch Corporation (``NYCE''). The United States also received an anonymous comment. The United States responds
herein to these comments.


I. Stored Value Cards


The subject raised most often by the comments was the treatment of stored value cards under the proposed Final Judgment.
Stored value cards are designed to accept a ``deposit'' of funds, which are then drawn down by transfer to other parties
in transactions. The card effectively replaces cash in these transactions. The most common use of stored value cards
today is in public transit, most notably in the Bay Area Rapid Transit system in the San Francisco area and the Washington,
DC Metro system. Rather than paying separately for each ride, a customer purchases a card for a certain amount, that
amount is ``deposited in'' the card, and the cost of each subsequent ride is deducted from the value in the card. The
passenger may add value to the card with additional ``deposits.'' Libraries also commonly sell stored valued cards
for use in their copying machines.
