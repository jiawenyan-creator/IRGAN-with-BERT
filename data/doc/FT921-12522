FT  25 JAN 92 / NatWest reduces mortgage rate
NATIONAL WESTMINSTER, second-largest of the 'big four' clearing banks,
yesterday cut its mortgage interest rate from 11.55 per cent to 10.99 per
cent, David Barchard writes.
The reduction matched last week's cuts by Abbey National bank and several
large building societies.
Several other large banks said they were keeping their mortgage interest
rates under review but had no immediate plans to make a cut. Lloyds said it
would review its rate at the weekend.
