FT  23 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Markets rally strongly on realignment
speculation
EUROPEAN government bond markets staged a strong rally yesterday afternoon
on rumours of a general realignment of the exchange rate mechanism, although
these were denied by government officials and central bankers.
The largest afternoon gains were seen in the French market, where the bond
futures contract rose nearly a point in late trading. The benchmark 8 1/2
per cent 10-year bond closed on a yield of 8.48 per cent, from 8.62 per cent
on Monday.
Rumours centred on a 5 per cent upward revaluation of the D-Mark block
currencies and a 3 per cent upward revaluation of the franc. This would
imply an effective 2 per cent devaluation of the French currency against the
D-Mark but French bonds rallied on the premise that a general realignment
would allow the Bundesbank and other central banks to cut interest rates.
The franc remained under pressure on the foreign exchange markets, The
trading at around FFr3.42 against the D-Mark, against a floor within the ERM
of FFr3.4305.
The government said the 1993 budget bill will not be introduced into
parliament until September 30, a week later than expected. Analysts are
expecting a reduction in government expenditure.
GERMAN government bonds led European markets lower during the morning
session following the release of figures showing German M3 money supply
growing at a higher-than-expected annual rate.
In the futures market, the December 10-year contract rose to 91.13 in late
trading, but during the morning the contract hit a low of 90.33 having
opened at 90.60. Volume was heavy at 98,500 contracts. The benchmark 8 per
cent 10-year bund closed on a yield of 7.48 per cent, from 7.51 per cent on
Monday.
The Bundesbank's favoured measure of money supply grew at an annual rate of
9 per cent in August, from 8.5 per cent in July. The target rate of growth
is 3.5 to 5.5 per cent, suggesting further interest rate cuts are unlikely.
Indeed, fears that August's money supply figures would be inflated by
international inflows into the D-Mark appeared to have little foundation.
The numbers showed only a small rise in time deposits, the most likely
destination for inflows of international cash. The strongest component
behind the overall rise in M3 was an increase in notes and coins in
circulation, suggesting monetary growth is being driven mainly by domestic
economic conditions.
YESTERDAY'S 1 percentage point base rate cut, and speculation of a further
easing in German interest rates, buoyed UK government bond prices, prompting
gains of nearly a point for short and medium-dated conventional gilts.
However, the strongest gains emerged in the index-linked sector, where fears
of higher inflation now that sterling has left the exchange rate mechanism
of the European Monetary System have encouraged strong demand for
index-linked stock.
Index-linked issues gained nearly five points yesterday with the 2 1/2 per
cent index-linked gilt due 2020 rising from 112 11/32 to 117 9/32 by late
afternoon.
The Bank of England issued a Pounds 600m tranche of 4 3/8 per cent
index-linked stock due 2004, available with effect from today - and the
second tranche of index-linked stock to be issued this week. The bank sold
Pounds 500m of index-linked stock on Monday.
Conventional gilts were boosted by the Bank's announcement of a one
percentage point cut in the base rate to 9 per cent and by sterling's slight
strengthening against the D-Mark. The 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 rose from
103 3/4 to 104 by late afternoon.
However, at the long end of the yield curve, prices dropped in the morning
on fears that a cut in interest rates could lead to higher inflation,
especially now that sterling is not a member of the ERM. The 9 per cent gilt
due 2011 opened at 97 21/32 , but recouped some of its earlier losses to end
at 97 15/32 .
ITALIAN government bonds were pulled lower during the morning session by the
weak tone in the French and German markets but also rallied later on hopes
for a general realignment of the ERM.
The 10-year fixed-rate government bond maturing May 2002 closed at 91.64,
from 91.58 at the opening. On Liffe, the BTP future traded up to 92.80 in
late trading, from 92.52 at the opening and a low of 92.15.
SWEDEN'S central bank held its marginal lending rate at 50 per cent in money
market operations, but yields on longer-dated government bonds fell during
the day, encouraged by the stronger tone of continental European markets.
The lending rate was cut from 500 per cent on Monday. The benchmark 11-year
government bond closed on a yield of 11.30 per cent, from 11.50 per cent on
Monday but still well above the 10.75 per cent yields seen at the end of
last week.
US Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday in the wake of unexpectedly good
housing starts figures and a reported increase in department and chain store
sales. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1
11/32 at 97 13/32 , to yield 7.462 per cent. The losses at the short end
were less pronounced, with the two-year note down 3/32 at 100 9/16 ,
yielding 3.927 per cent.
The news that sparked the early selling was the 10.4 per cent rise in August
housing starts, the biggest monthly gain since January 1991. Although one
month's worth of figures does not provide much of a lead on economic
conditions, the market was nervous because of calls from the International
Monetary Fund - meeting in Washington - for higher US interest rates once
the recovery is under way and uncertainty ahead of the afternoon's first
experimental 'Dutch', or single-price, auction of Dollars 14.5bn in new
two-year notes. The auction went well, with the securities awarded at a
yield of 4 per cent, the lowest since 1974. Although prices ticked up after
the auction, they plunged again on the news from the Johnson Redbook Service
that department and chain store sales rose 0.8 per cent in the last three
weeks.
