  [Text] Director general of the Mazeikiai oil terminal 
Bronislavas Vainora and Fluor Daniel Williams Brothers company's 
Vice President Charles Tumey signed a contract April 27 in 
Vilnius on the basic designing of a new oil terminal in Butinge, 
at the Baltic Sea. 
  The U.S.-based company was announced March 31 the winner of 
an international competition for the terminal project. The 
also-runs were Italy's Snaprogetti and Argentina's Techint. 
  Fluor Daniel will design the terminal for import and export 
of oil products, monitor the construction and help Lithuanians 
find financing for the project's implementation. The firm's 
vice president said on the Lithuanian television that the 
financing should be found by the customers themselves, i.e., the 
Mazeikiai enterprise, but his company will help to select the 
best of the offered deals. The sides have also signed a 
protocol-memorandum in which the Americans made a commitment to 
look for construction resources. In the Tumey's words, the 
project will be drafted in four or five months. 
  Vainora said his enterprise had money for the preparation of 
the project but the problem of financing for the construction 
has not been settled yet. Lithuanians continue talks with the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that has 
pledged financial help. 
  The preparatory work is already taking place in Butinge 
while 
the construction is scheduled to begin in summer. 
  The capacity of the projected terminal is 12 mln tons of oil 
per year. The construction will claim one and a half year and 
will cost, according to various studies, from USD 130 mln to USD 
200 mln.
