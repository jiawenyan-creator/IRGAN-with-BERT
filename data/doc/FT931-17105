FT  02 JAN 93 / Letter: No substitute for insuring safety of pensions
benefits
Sir, A central fund (Letters, December 24) is no answer at all to pensions
protection. There can be no substitute for trustees ensuring there are
adequate funds to secure at competitive insurance company rates the defined
deferred benefits which fall to be preserved on winding-up on a guaranteed
basis. It may be that some funds are so large that no UK insurance company
is capable of accepting the risk and, in these circumstances, the
substitution of money purchase benefits may be inevitable. Indeed, it should
be available as an option to members of all wound-up schemes.
However, such options are no reason to permit the discharge of obligations
by transfer payments to a discontinuance fund or other arrangements of
lesser value than the insurance market cost of securing the defined benefits
for each member. To substitute transfer values based on high assumed
investment returns from equities is to substitute hope value for guaranteed
benefits. Potential benefits, as a euphemism for expected benefits stripped
of their guarantee, are not an acceptable substitute. The fact that, after
completion of winding-up, a scheme no longer enjoys the financial support of
the employer is an important factor which cannot simply be ignored.
Mr Cockbain's proposed discontinuance fund would be a solution if he and his
partners personally guaranteed the deferred benefits to which members are
entitled under preservation legislation. If they did, I suspect the
'appropriate transfer payments' would be very much larger than they have in
mind at present and that they would alter the proposed investment strategy
radically away from equities and towards fixed-interest or index-linked
securities which provide a much closer match to the liabilities to be met.
