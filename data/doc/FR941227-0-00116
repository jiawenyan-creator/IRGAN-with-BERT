SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In carrying out its enforcement responsibilities under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, OSHA from time to
time investigates workplace incidents which involve not only injuries to workers directly exposed to hazards, but
injuries and potential injuries to employees who voluntarily attempt to rescue or assist their fellow workers. OSHA
is aware of many instances in which employees have voluntarily rescued coworkers or rendered emergency assistance
in the aftermath of workplace accidents, sometimes at considerable risk to themselves. Until recently, there has
been no written instruction by OSHA to its field offices providing guidance in such situations. Accordingly, the
agency has decided to issue an interpretive rule clarifying its citation policy regarding employers whose employees
perform or attempt to perform rescues of individuals in life-threatening danger.




It is not OSHA's policy to interfere with or to regulate every decision by a worker to place himself at risk to save another
individual. Nor is it OSHA's policy to issue citations to employers whose employees voluntarily undertake acts of
heroism to save another individual from imminent harm, where rescue operations are not part of the employee's job
responsibilities and the likelihood that a rescue may become necessary is not reasonably foreseeable.

At the same time, employers who have employees working in environments where the possibility of life-threatening
accidents is reasonably foreseeable are required by various OSHA standards and the general duty clause to take appropriate
precautions to assure that the rescuers themselves do not become victims. 

See, e.g., Pride Oil Well Service, 

15 BNAOSHC 1808 (Rev. Comm.1992); ARO. Inc., 1 BNAOSHC 1453 (Rev. Com. 1973). Accidents requiring rescue
efforts are reasonably foreseeable in certain working environments such as, for example, trenches and excavations,
hazardous waste operations and emergency response work, or construction work over water. Confined spaces are another
occupational setting where rescuers, without proper equipment and precautions, often are killed or injured. ``Worker
Deaths in Confined Spaces: A Summary of Surveillance Findings and Investigative Case Reports'', National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health, No. 94103 (1994).

Because the occurrence of accidents which invite rescue attempts is foreseeable in various industrial processes
and environments, a variety of OSHA standards include precautions and safeguards for rescue-related operations,
including, 

e.g., 

the emergency planning and response provisions of the process safety management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119(n), and
hazardous waste operations standard, 29 CFR 1910.120(1), (p) and (q); and the standards on confined spaces in general
industry, 29 CFR 1910.146, and in grain handling, 1910.272(d), (e), and (g). In construction, specific rescue precautions
are prescribed, 

e.g., 

for work performed near or over water, and for excavation work, 29 CFR 1926.106, 1926.651(g). 

See also 

29 CFR 1910.38 (employee emergency plans in general industry) and 1926.20, .21, and .35 (training and emergency action
plans in construction).
