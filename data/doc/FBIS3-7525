  [Text] Seoul, March 26 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang received Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev on 
Saturday morning and discussed North Korean nuclear problem and 
situation on the Korean peninsula and northeast Asia. 
  Yi said that reform policy by former Soviet Union exerted a 
great influence on world countries including many East European 
countries. 
  "But it is regrettable to see that North Korea does not show 
any sign of change," he said. 
  Gorbachev said that he knows very well South Korea is making 
efforts in resolving the problem on the Korean peninsula and 
expected that North Korea will change after all as the entire 
world is changing. 
  Gorbachev came here Friday at the invitation of the 
Federation for World Peace, an academic organization established 
by the Rev. Mun Son-myong, founder of the Unification Church.
