  [Text] Ethiopia has demanded that one of its former 
presidents, Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam, be extradited from 
Zimbabwe where he took exile after fleeing his country in 1991. 
This comes after Colonel Mengistu's recent (?statements) to the 
Zimbabwean press, criticizing the Ethiopian Government. 
Ethiopia's Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr. (Santahun H. Michael) 
said the former leader's continued presence in Zimbabwe would 
affect relations between the two countries. Mr. Mengistu's 
statements contravene his conditions of exile, which forbid 
comment on political developments in Ethiopia.
