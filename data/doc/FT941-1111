FT  26 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Stakis deal mooted
Suggestions that Stakis is close to clinching a deal to buy a clutch of four
star hotels worth in the region of Pounds 80m were being heard in the market
yesterday. The Scottish hotel group is said to have been visiting its big
institutional investors in recent weeks in readiness for an announcement.
With the hotel industry presently awash with unwanted chains, leisure
specialists had little trouble naming possible contenders. Favourite is the
Copthorne chain owned by Aer Lingus, which is known to have interested both
Stakis and Forte in the past, although the price being asked by the Irish
group is believed to have been discouraging. Queens Moat Houses, the
troubled hotel group, was another name being mentioned. It may be tempted
into selling some hotels to reduce its debts.
Any deal of such a size would involve Stakis in a cash raising exercise.
Yesterday Stakis shares were steady at 85p. Forte survived a James Capel
downgrade to close a half-penny up at 257 1/2 p.
Shares in Wellcome recovered from the three-year low achieved on Thursday
following disappointing figures and rose 22 to 572p with supportive brokers
reiterating their positive stances.
UBS repeated its buy recommendation arguing that the shares, at a 34 per
cent discount to the market but with growing earnings and a rising yield
premium, were very oversold. Wellcome also benefited from positive newspaper
comment. However, some securities houses are becoming increasingly cautious.
Smith New Court backed away from its 'mild buy' and Goldman Sachs cut profit
forecasts for Wellcome's figures over the next four years. Goldman moved to
Pounds 710m from Pounds 725m for this year, Pounds 750m from Pounds 790m for
next year and to Pounds 800m and Pounds 855m for 1996 and 1997.
Oil stocks hung fire as the first day of the Opec meeting provided no
indications on the direction of a a decision on quotas. Many analysts expect
the quota of 24.5m barrels a day to be maintained which might well send oil
prices lower. Shell Transport fell 6 to 656p but BP slipped down 1 to 373p.
Exploration and telecoms group Pittencrieff lifted 11 to 411p after the
company announced further details of the proposed demerger of its PCI
telecoms arm, which it hopes to list on the London market.
Banks and insurances led the way forward as a rush of US interest in the
oversold sectors forced marketmakers who had cut back their trading books on
the last day of the trading account to struggle for stock. The short
covering sent Lloyds up 22 to 568p, Barclays up 12 to 537p, Royal Insurance
12 to 271p Sun Alliance up 17 at 343p.
One advance in an otherwise weak electricity sector came as Eastern again
went into the market, buying 550,000 shares at between 627 and 630p. The
stock added 3 to 633p.
Beazer Homes made a fair market debut, but talk prior to trading that it
would be marked down proved right as the shares came under immediate
pressure. After opening at 165p, they fell 10, before recovering to close a
net 3 off at 162p. Turnover was a massive 53m.
It was a less auspicious start for MAID, the computer services group, which
came to the market at 110p and slipped down to close at 102p. Turnover was
708,000.
Drinks giant Allied Lyons basked in positive comment following the Pounds
739m takeover of Domecq, the Spanish spirits group, and the shares gained 7
to 568p. Merrydown, the cider group, announced the loss of its finance
director. The shares slid 16 to 133p.
Geest retreated 17 to 245p after unveiling poor results on Thursday, pulling
down Fyffes 6 to 94p.
There was heavy volume in Kingfisher as buyers returned following recent
underperformance prompted mainly by strategic concerns prior to and after
its results this week. The shares rose 5 to 550p, with turnover touching 8m.
There was further support for Great Univeral Stores, buoyed by continued
talk of an imminent share buy-back, and the shares finished 10 up at 584p
with turnover at 4.2m.
Rolls-Royce was one of the few engineering stocks to hold up well in the
depressed morning trading, bouncing back from heavy selling in the past
couple of weeks. It closed 4 up at 184 1/2 p.
Other engineering stocks doing well included BICC up 4 to 438p and Delta up
6 to 542p amid bid speculation.
BTR was hit by profit-taking late in the session, closing down 4 1/2 at 377p
after dropping to 374p during the day.
Garton Engineering fell back 2 to 122p despite good results.
Vehicle distributors also had a dull day with T Cowie closing down 10 at
304p and Evans Halshaw dropping 9 to 534.
Among transport stocks, P&amp;O continued its good run after Thursday's figures,
rising another 14 to 709p, after pushing ahead 27 at one stage yesterday.
National Express was also in demand early on after posting a 36 per cent
profit rise, but ticked back to close unchanged at 270p.
IOMS Packet rose 22 to 310p ahead of Monday's results.
Among leading companies reporting full-year figures on Monday, Pearson
bounced 15 to 635p and Inchcape slipped 5 to 552p.
Shipping company James Fisher fell 30 to 55p after revealing a Pounds 5.6m
annual loss.
