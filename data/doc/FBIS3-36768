  [Text] The Russian government has appropriated 550 billion 
rubles for Moscow to buy foodstuffs, Konstantin Buravlyov, First 
Deputy Prime Minister of the Moscow city government in charge of 
economic reforms, told Interfax. 
  "Starvation became a real threat in Moscow at the end of the 
last year and in the beginning of this year," Buravlyov 
admitted. He said that Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov had succeeded 
in persuading the central government that the situation with 
essential supplies to the capital was critical. "The president 
and the prime minister had to intervene to remedy it," Buravlyov 
said. 
  In his words, 300 billion rubles were made available to the 
city to buy foodstuffs during the year at the current Central 
Bank discount rate. The only benefit Moscow will enjoy is that 
it will have to pay the credit back in the period from September 
to the end of 1994. 
  The government appropriated another 250 billion rubles for 
purchases of foodstuffs if other regions fhicf demand 
prepayment, Buravlyov explained. He also said that the food 
processing sector which needed raw materials accounted for one 
third of all of Moscow's industry. 
  At the same time, the Russian government owes Moscow 145 
billion rubles in mutual tax settlements.
