FT  04 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Romania defeat Argentina in thriller; meet
Sweden
Romania will meet Sweden in the World Cup quarter-final after an inspired
performance last night to beat Argentina 3-2 in one of the most exciting
games of the tournament so far.
The appearance of banned superstar Diego Maradona in the press box as a TV
commentator could not inspire his teammates to break down a determined
Romanian defence that defended against tremendous pressure for most of the
second half.
A double strike from Ilie Dumitrescu set up the Romania victory, the first
three goals of the game coming in a seven-minute burst early in the match.
Romania went ahead in the 11th minute through a curling free kick by
Dumitrescu but Argentina equalised five minutes later when Gabriel Batistuta
scored from a dubious penalty.
Two minutes later Romania were back in front after skipper Gheorghe Hagi
split the defence for Dumitrescu to score his second.
Hagi put Romania 3-1 ahead with a rising drive in the 58th minute but his
team had to survive intense second-half Argentine pressure during which Abel
Balbo pulled a goal back in the 75th minute.
In Dallas, Sweden was able to force Saudi Arabia into a change of tactics,
conquer the 38'C heat and advance to the World Cup quarterfinals with a 3-1
victory.
Kennet Andersson scored twice and set up another for Martin Dahlin Sunday to
take Sweden into the last eight for the first time since 1958  - when they
went all the way to the final.
