NEWSWIRE: BIG EAST CONFERENCE ADDS MIAMI 
The University of Miami, a football power trying to improve its basketball 
image, joined the Big East Conference on Wednesday and the conference 
commissioner says that probably saved the league. 
"To be very blunt with you, our future was at stake," Commissioner Mike 
Tranghese said. 
"If the Big East and the University of Miami could not have gotten together, 
I'm not certain we had an answer that would have satisfied the football 
concerns of Pitt, Boston College and Syracuse." 
There was fear that those schools would have joined Miami and others with 
Division I-A football programs to form an Eastern Seaboard conference. 
Miami will become the 10th Big East member beginning with the 1991-92 seasons 
in most sports. 
Miami football will stay on its own until it can work out a commitment with the 
three other Big East Division I-A members because the Big East does not compete 
as a conference in football.
