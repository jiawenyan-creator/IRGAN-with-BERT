  [Text] Hangzhou, January 12 (XINHUA) -- East China's 
Zhejiang Province reported record economic development in 1993. 
  Its gross domestic product last year went up by 25 percent 
over the previous year to 164.5 billion yuan-worth. 
  A provincial official attributed the success to the 
deepening 
of the reform, improving economic results and technical 
upgrading. 
  Last year saw the province's industrial output value amount 
to 392.8 billion yuan, up 52.5 percent over the 1992 figure. 
  Meanwhile, its agricultural output value went up by 1.9 
percent to 39.36 billion yuan, thanks to a successful 
rearrangement of the product mix. 
  As a result, the income of urban residents last year 
averaged 
3,400 yuan per capita, up 18 percent over the previous year, and 
that of rural people was 1,590 yuan per capita, up six percent. 
  Zhejiang exported 4.44 billion U.S. dollars-worth of goods 
last year, an increase of 19.9 percent over 1992, and its actual 
use of foreign investment amounted to more than one billion U.S. 
dollars, up 150 percent.
