  [Text] The Patriotic Urban and Rural Union [Union 
Patriotique Urbaine et Rurale, UPUR] of Sylvan Jolibois 
unreservedly supports the resolution adopted by the Committee of 
Actions for National Reconciliation [CARENA]. Furthermore, it 
warns the CARENA organizing members against the many-sided 
pressures that tend to keep the country under the yoke of 
foreign trusteeship. Let us listen to Jolibois. 
  [Begin recording] We firmly support the final dual 
resolution, and warn the participants against the pressures that 
continue to be exerted and that can lead to the formation of a 
noncredible government that would have no chance to solve the 
Haitian problem or enjoy the solidarity of the Haitian people to 
oppose the dictates of foreign interference. We stand for a 
government of true national reconciliation through the strict 
implementation of Article 149. [end recording]
