FT  13 AUG 93 / Papuan threat to RTZ sale
RTZ Corporation's Dollars 108m (Pounds 73.6m) plan to reduce its
shareholding in the Lihir gold project in Papua New Guinea - the largest
known gold deposit outside South Africa - was under threat yesterday from
the PNG government.
Mr Paias Wingti, PNG's prime minister, said the proposed sale by RTZ of part
of its 80 per cent share in the project to Niugini Mining and Venezuelan
Goldfields, a Canadian prospecting company, was 'in flagrant violation' of
his government's decision to take a 50 per cent stake.
Previously the PNG government had indicated it wanted 30 per cent of Lihir
but Mr Wingti said that RTZ had been informed in May that it would take 50
per cent and then hand on 20 per cent to a suitable partner.
RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, said some aspects of Mr Wingti's
statement came as a 'surprise'. It would discuss the situation with Niugini
Mining, based in Port Moresby the PNG capital, and with Vengold.
Mr Wingti said: 'This decision has been forced on the government by the
inordinate delays and procrastinations which have taken place over the last
10 years.' RTZ had repeatedly told the government that Lihir was not a
viable project. 'We in turn have now informed them that my government has
sufficient confidence in the property to retain 50 per cent.'
The Malaysian Mining Corporation recently said it had been offered 20 per
cent of Lihir by the PNG government. Yesterday Mr Masket Iangalio, PNG mines
minister, said MMC had offered to fund the government's 30 per cent stake in
Lihir and MMC officials would shortly visit the Lihir site, in the crater of
an extinct volcano.
The affair threatens to be embarrassing for RTZ, which prides itself on
being able to negotiate effectively with any government.
The dispute is likely to further damage PNG's reputation with investors.
Since Mr Wingti's government was elected last year it has been involved in
serious disputes over the Porgera and Mt Kare gold mines.
