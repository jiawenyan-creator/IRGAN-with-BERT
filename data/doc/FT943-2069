FT  21 SEP 94 / Observer: Egged on
As if in rebuttal of Observer's jibe yesterday - relating to a Pounds 4.6m
reduction in parliamentary costs, thanks to lowered 'activities' - word
reaches us of the peripatetic Tim Eggar, who has just spent his third
consecutive night on an aeroplane.
Sunday evening saw him whizz back from Chile, part of a business delegation.
On Monday he joined a night flight to Baku, attended the signing of British
Petroleum's Azerbaijan oil deal, and flew back last night. Presumably a
well-earned rest tomorrow then? 'He has a full diary,' says his office.
Well, he is minister for energy.
