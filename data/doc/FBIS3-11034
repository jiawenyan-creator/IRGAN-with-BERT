  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said today in 
Phnom Penh that his country's diplomatic offensive seeks to 
convey the truth about the Caribbean Island, within the dynamic 
context of changes in the current world. 
  Speaking to local Phnom Penh reporters, Robaina said that 
the 
basic objective of his previous tours of Caribbean and African 
countries, and his current tour of Asian countries, is to 
explain the truth about what is being done in Cuba. In 
developing our foreign policy, we need to explain to our friends 
and to governments what we are doing in our country regarding 
the economic transformation process in which we are engulfed, 
Robaina said. 
  With these objectives, we could not ignore this region, 
which 
has achieved important economic results over the past few years. 
Their experience can be useful to us, Robaina added. 
  The Cuban foreign minister told the press that Cuba is open 
to foreign investments in the areas of petroleum, nickel, 
agriculture, tourism, biotechnology, and the pharmaceutical 
industry. He added that this process is difficult and complex 
because it is done under the tremendous pressure of the blockade 
imposed by Washington against Cuba for more than 30 years. There 
is still implacable persecution of all those willing to 
negotiate with Cuba. Today, of every 10 contacts we make, eight 
are suspended because of such threats. But by no means will we 
stop our direct contacts with various countries throughout the 
world, he said. 
  Robaina in Phnom Penh stressed the success achieved despite 
the economic, commercial, and financial blockade, and added: We 
are neither hell nor heaven, but a beautiful island, which 
defends its sovereignty, independence, and achievements.
