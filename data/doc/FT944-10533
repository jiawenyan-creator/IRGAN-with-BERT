FT  10 NOV 94 / Service launched to help businesses find 'angels'
A matchmaking service to bring together small businesses and business
'angels' was launched yesterday by National Westminster Bank.
The six-month pilot operation - based on branches in north-west England and
the Thames Valley region - is intended to evolve into a national register of
private investors wanting to put money into small companies.
Access to the register of investors will be through NatWest branches for the
bank's small business customers, and through 12 specific intermediaries such
as Capital Exchange and Capital Access for other small companies.
Three training and enterprise councils - Bedfordshire, Devon and Cornwall,
and South and East Cheshire - are also involved.
NatWest is providing the service free of charge to investors, intermediaries
and its small business customers. Those using intermediaries may have to
pay.
Mr Duncan Matthews, head of NatWest's technology unit, said the register
would start with the names of about 200 investors and an investment
potential of Pounds 50m. He expects between 300 and 500 applications during
the pilot.
The register gives details about investors, including investment amounts,
sectors of interest and the extent of involvement desired in the businesses
where they invest.
Potential investors can contact Mr Matthews or one of his colleagues on 071
454 2236.
