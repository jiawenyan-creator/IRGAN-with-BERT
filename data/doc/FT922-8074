FT  14 MAY 92 / Press freedom call to CSCE meeting
INTERNATIONAL news organisations and Unesco told the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe yesterday that its promotion of press freedom in
Europe could affect other parts of the world, AP reports from Helsinki.
'Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression. . . . without
interference. The CSCE can make these hopes a reality,' said Mr Leonard
Marks of the Washington-based World Press Freedom Committee. 'Established
democracies now have an unparalleled opportunity to give help and guidance
to the new democracies as they build their new highways of freedom,' he
said. The committee is a co-ordinating group of national and international
news organisations.
Mr Marks urged delegates in a plenary session of the 52-nation security and
human rights conference to adopt a 10-point charter rejecting censorship and
other restrictions on information and the movement of journalists. 'If a
democracy is to be firmly rooted, there must be no law infringing the
freedom of the press,' he said.
The charter, approved in January 1987 at a London conference on censorship
problems, outlines principles designed to permit free, independent news
media to function effectively.
It says journalists should be free to travel over national borders and their
visa applications should 'be handled promptly'.
Mr Frederico Mayor, Unesco's director-general, said in a message read to the
delegates by an aide that freedom of the press is one of the most essential
components of a democratic society.
