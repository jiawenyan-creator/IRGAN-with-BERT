FT  02 FEB 94 / IMF to hold talks on Brazilian standby loan
A team from the International Monetary Fund arrives in Brazil tomorrow to
begin talks which the government hopes will lead to the granting of the
standby loan it needs to go ahead with a bank debt restructuring agreement,
Stephen Fidler writes.
Mr Pedro Malan, the Brazilian central bank president, said in London
yesterday he was still hopeful an IMF loan could be arranged, despite the
defeat last week of a government plan to increase corporate income tax.
This was in part because there was increased optimism about the current
constitutional revision process. The deadline for the revision may now be
extended one month to April 15.
This is also the deadline for the deal with international banks covering
Dollars 52bn (Pounds 34.6bn) of debt. An IMF deal is needed for the accord.
Although a two-thirds majority of banks could waive this condition, the US
Treasury has said it will only issue a special series of US Treasury
zero-coupon bonds to back the restructuring if an IMF agreement is in place.
Mr Malan is expected in Washington today to see the IMF and to negotiate
terms on these bonds.
