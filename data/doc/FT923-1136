FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Cathay Pacific blames inflation
for China move
CATHAY Pacific Airways, the Hong Kong carrier which is part of the Swire
group, has set up an airline information processing company in Guangzhou,
capital of China's booming Guangdong province, to counter Hong Kong's high
inflation rate, Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
Cathay blamed ballooning wages, rentals and other overheads for cutting
profits.
It said Guangzhou had been chosen for its proximity to Hong Kong and its
potential as a centre for information processing with improving
communications links.
