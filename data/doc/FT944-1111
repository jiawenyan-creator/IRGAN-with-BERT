FT  22 DEC 94 / BSkyB to step up war on pirates
British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, plans to
intensify its legal battle against commercial pirates after a significant
victory in the High Court.
The company this week obtained a permanent injunction against Mr David
Lyons, a supplier of pirate devices, who was described by Mr Justice Aldous
as 'a parasite'.
BSkyB said yesterday that Mr Lyons has to give up all pirate devices in his
possession. Both his building society and bank accounts are to be frozen.
Pirates have been using a range of devices to try to get round BSkyB's
scrambling system, which is designed to ensure that only those who pay
monthly subscriptions can watch most of the channels.
In the past devices have ranged from counterfeit cards which can 'unlock'
the signal to others designed to switch on 'dead' smart cards or upgrade
genuine cards so that they can be used to view all BSkyB channels.
Lawyers for Mr Lyons said that copyright law required BSkyB to show that his
devices possessed features which made them particularly suitable to enable
people to view BSkyB channels when they were not authorised to do so.
It was also argued that the requirement under the Copyright Designs and
Patents Act 1988 that broadcasters have to transmit to a satellite from the
UK amounted to discrimination under European law.
Mr Justice Aldous said the first argument was 'untenable and without merit'.
In reply to the second the judge said Mr Lyons was 'a parasite' who was not
personally suffering any discrimination.
BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a
significant stake, said yesterday: 'Since the High Court has now confirmed
what BSkyB has always believed, BSkyB will continue to pursue all other
pirates and parasites who infringe its rights.'
Since the summer, when the company changed the cards of all its subscribers,
there has been no sign of working counterfeit cards on the market.
