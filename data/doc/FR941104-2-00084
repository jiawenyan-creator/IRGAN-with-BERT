<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; Modified System of Records</DOCTITLE>


Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Department
of Justice, proposes to modify the following system of records_previously published October 5, 1993 (58 FR 51853):



The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) Alien File (A-File) and Central Index System (CIS), Justice/INS001A



Specifically, INS has clarified and combined routine uses D. and H. into one routine use, now identified as D., which
relates to law enforcement disclosure. It has removed routine use E. which had proposed disclosure during discovery
proceedings, and has added a routine use, also designated as E., which permits disclosure to a court during litigation.
Finally, INS has revised routine uses G. and L. Revised routine use G. clarifies the users and uses by adding language
which had been inadvertently omitted. Revised routine use L., redesignated as K., clarifies that information may
be disclosed not only to assist the United States in collecting its debts but also to assist foreign governments in
collecting their debts. Affected routine uses have been italicized for public convenience.
Title 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) and (11) provide that the public be given a 30-day period in which to comment on any new routine
use of a system of records. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which has oversight responsibilities under
the Act, requires a 40-day period in which to conclude its review of the proposed changes.
Therefore, please submit any comments by December 5, 1994. The public, OMB, and the Congress are invited to send written
comments to Patricia E. Neely, Systems Policy Staff, Justice Management Division, Department of Justice, Washington,
DC 20530 (Room 850, WCTR Building).
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), the Department has provided a report to OMB and the Congress on the proposed modification.



Dated: October 6, 1994.
