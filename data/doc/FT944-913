FT  23 DEC 94 / Three Indian ministers quit
Three scandal-tainted Indian ministers resigned last night, clearing the way
for Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, to try to improve the ruling
Congress (I) party's corruption-tarnished image. Mr B Shankaranand, the
health minister, and Mr Romeshwar Thakur, the rural development minister,
stepped down following intense criticism of their roles in the 1992 Rs40bn
(Pounds 816m) Bombay securities market scandal. Mr Kalpanath Rai, the food
minister, resigned after he was condemned in a government report into the
handling of a massive sugar shortage earlier this year.
Their resignations come after two weeks of persistent attacks from Congress
MPs, who were prompted into action by the party's serious defeat in recent
state elections in which corruption allegations cost the party many votes.
MPs put pressure on Mr Rao to act quickly because the party faces another
round of state polls in February and a general election which is due to be
held by mid-1996. But the three ministers held out, saying they had done
nothing wrong. Mr Rao hoes the resignations will help stop in-fighting in
Congress and encourage ruling party MPs to unite in advance of the next
round of polls.
