FT  05 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses focus on domestic
matters in quiet trading
BOURSES concentrated on domestic matters yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
PARIS was active in the first hour of trading but then quietened down until
just before the close when some arbitrage-related business was noted. The
CAC-40 ended up 4.32 at 1,988.09 in moderate turnover of FFr2.4bn.
Elf fell FFr10.30 to FFr374.70 following news late on Tuesday that the
government was going ahead with the sale of 2.3 per cent of Elf's share
capital on March 13. Dealers were surprised at the fall, since the
uncertainty about the timing of the issue had now been lifted. The fact that
there was not a US tranche this time indicated that the underwriters saw
little difficulty in placing the state's shares.
Euro Disney returned to fashion, closing up FFr2.50 at FFr158.80. By
contrast, Peugeot fell FFr5 to FFr732 on news of a 6.5 per cent year-on-year
fall in its car sales in February.
There was movement in second-liners with Beghin-Say up FFr19 at FFr640 and
Spie Batignolles down FFr17 to FFr330 but dealers found no reasons for the
moves. Perrier and Exor were both re-quoted yesterday, with the former
rising FFr14 to FFr1,531 and the latter losing FFr5 to FFr1,490.
FRANKFURT paused, the DAX index falling 4.26 to 1,759.05 after a decline of
0.47 to 714.97 in the FAZ at midsession. Strength in the pre-market, with
talk of the DAX testing 1,800 was sapped by a subsequent lack of buying
orders and a feeling that the market was getting expensive after its recent
gains.
Turnover held up well at DM7.8bn after DM7.6bn. Falls in senior blue chips
were inconsistent, with Deutsche Bank only 20 pfg lower at DM735.30, after
DM740 early in the day, but Siemens closing DM9.50 lower at DM696.50
although dealers saw no selling pressure on the stock.
MILAN fell for the sixth day in a row. the Comit index fell 3.72 to 525.70
in turnover estimated at near Tuesday's L76.8bn.
The lack of volume made the market vulnerable to rumours, which ranged from
a small brokerage going bust in Turin to another Stet bond, but this time
with warrants into Sip ordinary shares.
The financial index dropped 1.8 per cent, with Banco di Roma and Santo
Spirito continuing to fall following last week's share exchange news. Banco
di Roma fell L95 or 4.2 per cent to L2,160, while Santo Spirito dropped L125
or 5.4 per to L2,205. The imminent San Paolo share offering also depressed
the sector.
In telecoms, Stet was unchanged at L2,380 while Sip fell L15 to L1,400 on
the bond rumours. Elsewhere, Breda was temporarily suspended after a sell
order in a thin market caused the stock to fall 10 per cent. When trading
resumed, the stock fell L23 or 6.7 per cent to L320.
AMSTERDAM saw strong activity in Fokker after reports that the aircraft
manufacturer was studying closer co-operation with Deutsche Aerospace. The
share price gained Fl 3.10 or 9.4 per cent before news that the group's Fl
500m rights issue would be in April. The stock closed up Fl 2.00 or 6 per
cent at Fl 34.90. The CBS Tendency Index closed 1.1 higher at 128.1 in
turnover of Fl 656.9m.
DSM, which reports 1991 results on Monday, continued its gains to close Fl
2.70 higher at Fl 112.70, while Akzo was 40 cents firmer at Fl 150.80.
Wessanen, the food manufacturer, which reports 1991 results today, gained Fl
1.00 to Fl 91.10.
ZURICH recovered from a midsession slump to close with industrials higher,
but banks and insurers under pressure from rising interest rates. Bearer
shares in Swiss Bank Corp fell SFr3 to SFr309 on profit-taking after good
1991 results.
Sulzer registered added SFr150 to SFr5,710. The engineer said on Tuesday
that it was opening its registered shares to foreigners and splitting its
shares 10-for-one.
STOCKHOLM also showed interest in the stock split theme although, with a
five-for-one split. Sharp rises in profits and dividend were also in
evidence as the retailer Hennes &amp; Mauritz leapt SKr100 to SKr700.
The Affarsvarlden General index rose 12.7 to 974.0 with the fashion for
cyclicals extending to the steelmaker, Sandvik, where the B free shares rose
SKr11 to SKr390.
COPENHAGEN steadied after falling in each of the previous seven days to a
succession of 1992 lows, writes Hilary Barnes. The CSE index rose 0.99 to
345.58.
Carlsberg B, DKr18 higher at DKr338, recovered losses sustained after
Monday's announcement of a rights issue. Novo Nordisk rose DKr8 to DKr525
after a period of steady decline.
BRUSSELS closed down on profit-taking. The Bel-20 ended down 1.47 at
1,233.25, after an intra-day high of 1,242.90, in turnover of BFr1bn.
Groupe AG, the insurer, rose BFr25 to BFr2,255 while Generale Bank, its
possible partner in a merger, fell BFr30 to BFr6,720.
ISTANBUL rose sharply after inflation figures showed a fall in the monthly
rate. The 75-share index closed up 138.19 or 3.96 per cent at 3,623.58.
