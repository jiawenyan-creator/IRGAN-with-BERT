  [Text] Tehran, Jan 10 (AFP)--A high-level Iranian 
delegation left here Monday [10 January] for Germany amid shaky 
relations between the two countries, diplomats in Tehran said. 
  The delegation, headed by National Security Council 
secretary 
Mohammad Javad Larijani, is to discuss ways to boost cooperation 
with Germany, Iran's main economic partner. 
  Larijani, who is also deputy-head of the parliament's 
foreign 
affairs subcommittee, said earlier that the delegation would 
seek to "improve understanding and friendship" between the two 
countries. 
  Last October, an Iranian and four Lebanese went on trial in 
Berlin for the murder of four Kurdish opposition leaders, 
allegedly ordered by the Tehran authorities. 
  The German federal prosecutor's office has openly accused 
the 
Iranian secret service of masterminding the killings. Iran has 
denied all involvement. 
  Meanwhile, Iran's supreme court has upheld a death sentence 
against a German technician, Helmut Szimkus, jailed four years 
ago on charges of spying for Iraq. 
  Germany has asked Iran to spare the life of Zsimkus, 59. 
  On Thursday the Iranian judiciary suggested that the German 
could be pardoned by Iran's spiritual guide Ayatollah 'Ali 
Khamene'i, who issued a decree on Sunday granting either an 
amnesty to 2,389 prisoners or a reduction in their sentences. 
  The German embassy in Tehran contacted by AFP was unable to 
say whether Szimkus was among those amnestied.
