FT  20 MAR 93 / One-day strike called at Ford
A ONE-DAY strike of 8,500 white-collar staff at Ford has been called for
Thursday by the MSF white-collar union in protest at the threat of
compulsory redundancies. The date coincides with the launch of Ford's Mondeo
model.
Foremen at Ford's Dagenham, Swansea and Southampton plants are today due to
end the strike they started four days ago against the compulsory redundancy
threat. Ford said last night their strike had 'made no impact on
production'.
