FT  24 SEP 93 / Airbus to lose Dollars 2.5bn orders
AIRBUS, the world's second biggest commercial jet aircraft manufacturer,
faces losing Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.62bn) of orders in the wake of the GPA
restructuring proposals yesterday.
GPA has orders for 51 Airbuses which could be cancelled. It singles out the
40 scheduled to be delivered after 1994 and warns that unless cancellation
deadlines are postponed 'it is likely that it would be necessary to cancel
most of the . . . orders'. Those deadlines are the earlier of December 31,
1993 and 30 months before delivery.
Airbus said yesterday it had not discussed this yet with GPA.
The remaining eight could also be cancelled if a charge were paid. GPA said
that the charge could come from 'pre-delivery payments and with no
significant further likely cash outlay'.
Some 45 Airbuses have been delivered so far to GPA. The restructuring
proposals could cut the backlog to a handful.
The aircraft affected are A320 and A321 narrow body jets and A330 widebodied
jets. GPA had already cancelled orders for 30 aircraft. Last December, GPA
was Airbus' biggest customer with 123 aircraft on order.
Airbus still has orders for more than 1,700 aircraft. All four partners in
the Airbus consortium - Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace, British
Aerospace and Casa of Spain - have had to scale down output to match the
slowdown in expected deliveries of new aircraft.
The consortium's production is now expected to grow from about 150 aircraft
this year to about 170 in 1995, compared with an original target of 225 in
1995.
Boeing comes out of the GPA proposals rather better off. The cancellations
and postponements detailed in the GPA proposals were reached last year.
Boeing had been scheduled to deliver 66 aircraft up to 1997. This has been
reduced to 26 up to 1999.
Cancellation deadlines are being extended for four Boeing 757s. Boeing says
every second order due for delivery in 1997-98 may be postponed for two
years without penalty, and it has given GPA a Dollars 345m financing
facility.
