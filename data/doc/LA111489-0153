RELIGION; 
CATHOLIC AIDS SESSION RAPPED 
Priests, nuns and health workers used to dealing with AIDS sufferers today 
attacked the Vatican's first conference on the disease for not being prepared 
to listen to AIDS patients themselves. 
"I'm quite distressed that this conference about AIDS has totally ignored 
people with AIDS," said Peter Larkin, a Roman Catholic from London who suffers 
from the disease. "I get a bit tired being told how I feel and how I think, and 
I would prefer if people asked me," he told a splinter group of priests, nuns 
and health workers. 
About 80 people broke away from the conference to stage their own meeting 
during a lunch break that turned into a virtual insurrection against conveners 
of the conference. 
John White, an Irish Catholic priest with acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
who was evicted from the conference Monday for holding up a banner reading "The 
Church Has AIDS," was readmitted today after some participants petitioned for 
him to be allowed back in.
