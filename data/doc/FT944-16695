FT  12 OCT 94 / Observer: On guard
Good news for left-leaning oldies. Tony Blair has appointed an adviser older
than himself. Derek Scott, 47, who is married to Channel Four's political
editor Elinor Goodman and is one of BZW's economic boffins, has taken on a
job-share as Blair's economics adviser.
Scott, who will continue at BZW, is not known as one of the City's great
economics thinkers - but then who is? But he comes highly recommended by
Lord Healey, Labour's last chancellor. Scott was Healey's numbers man;
Healey says in his autobiography that Scott did him 'yeoman service because
he could argue with the Treasury without losing its confidence'.
Yeoman? We thought Blair was hiring praetorians. Still, they're all
spear-carriers, aren't they?
