FT  22 JAN 93 / Euro-MPs call for oil tanker controls
THE European parliament yesterday called for tighter controls on oil tankers
operating in EC waters, after the Braer disaster in the Shetlands, writes
Lionel Barber in Strasbourg. MEPs criticised member states and the
Commission for failing to crack down on rogue tankers operating with
inadequately trained crews, but praised the Commission's Ecu700,000 (Pounds
566,000) aid for Shetland's stricken farmers and fishermen.
The parliament urged tougher safety measures, including a ban on oil tankers
more than 15 years old from EC ports, setting a date for banning oil tankers
without a double hull from EC waters, obligatory pilot guidance when tankers
pass near the coast, as well as radar control of vessels in dangerous areas,
and inspections of ships in EC ports.
Last night the International Maritime Organisation said the move was doomed
to fail because the bulk of the world tanker fleet was built in the 1970s
and only a few had double hulls.
