  [Text] Buenos Aires, 21 Mar (NA) -- An official source said 
today that any ambiguity in President Carlos Menem's concept of 
the pharmaceutical patents law and the conditions for joining 
NAFTA "is in appearance only." 
  The source admitted that in Menem's comments before meeting 
with U.S. Vice President Al Gore "some kind of misunderstanding 
could have occurred," while declaring that Menem had been 
referring not only to joining NAFTA as such, but also to its 
prior approval by the U.S. Congress, which will occur in the 
middle of this year. 
  The source also said that "the approval of the patents law 
this year will be solely a gesture of Argentine good will toward 
the U.S. congressmen," and that "within two years, however, the 
approval of that law will be an essential condition for joining 
NAFTA." 
  This explanation was necessary because Menem believes the 
approval of the patents law "does not represent a full 
condition" for joining NAFTA, while in private he said that 
without that law "it would be impossible" to imagine Argentina 
becoming a member of NAFTA.
