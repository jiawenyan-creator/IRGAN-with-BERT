DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
COUNTY TO SEEK STATE GRANT FOR VEHICLE PARK 
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved applying to the 
state for a $17.5-million grant to build an off-highway vehicle park in the 
Santa Clarita Valley. 
The board made the request contingent upon the project satisfactorily passing 
environmental tests. 
Walt Disney Co. has warned that noise from the park in rugged Whitney Canyon 
would jeopardize filming at its nearby movie ranch. The environmental study is 
expected to be completed this summer. The earliest the facility could be opened 
is the summer of 1991, officials said. 
Off-road enthusiasts have been lobbying for a place to ride since the only 
other park in the area, Indian Dunes Park, was closed in 1984.
