FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Australia Air loses fight for
China route rights
Rights to fly between Australia and China were finally lost yesterday by
Australia Air, the would-be international airline, when Australia's
International Air Services Commission revoked last year's route authority
decision.
The move follows a year-long struggle by Australia Air to find the necessary
financial backing which would allow it to take to the skies.
Although yesterday's decision did not come as a surprise, it is a blow for
the Australian government's efforts to deregulate the international aviation
scene and do away with Qantas' long-standing monopoly in this area.
Australia Air was the only potential new carrier to emerge as a result of
the new liberalised policy.
The only other beneficiary has been Ansett, which shares the national market
with Qantas and which has been awarded some international authorities.
Ansett, however, has been extremely cautious about using these.
The IASC said it was 'in the public interest' to revoke the decision to give
the China rights to Australia Air. Other airlines will now be able to apply
for the route authority in due course.
Australia Air won the rights in March 1993, and initially hoped to get a
weekly service linking Beijing and Sydney up and running by late-1993.
Superficially, this looked a feasible scheme, since only one rival carrier -
Air China - flew directly between the two countries and business/tourism
links are growing.
However, Australia Air ran into a lengthy spat with Qantas - which had flown
the route in the 1980s - over which was the 'designated' carrier under the
Sino-Australian air services agreement.
Australia Air's efforts to raise the ADollars 55m (USDollars 40.4m) demanded
by the IASC before it could start operating also proved unsuccessful. It
asked for a number of extensions from the IASC, which were granted, but
yesterday the authorities finally called a halt.
