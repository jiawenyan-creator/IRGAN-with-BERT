FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Air Europe supervisors may seek
compensation from BA
Supervisors to Air Europe, the leisure group that crashed in March 1991, are
considering seeking possible compensation from British Airways in connection
with the collapse of the company.
The details emerged on the day that unsecured creditors to Air Europe
received a dividend of 5.35p in the pound in efforts to provide a speedy
settlement of claims.
It emerged at the time of the Pounds 610,000 High Court settlement of BA
with Virgin Atlantic in January in connection with anti-competitive 'dirty
tricks' that Air Europe had been co-operating with Virgin.
Mr Phil Wallace, one of the supervisors from accountants KPMG Peat Marwick,
said yesterday: 'We have watched the proceedings with interest. We are still
investigating the relationship between BA and Air Europe given what came out
of the Virgin case.' He said money had been allocated to fund an
investigation. 'I am persuaded that we should continue. It is conceivable
that something could come out there.'
BA last night rejected any suggestion that there was a case to answer. 'The
reasons for Air Europe's downfall are well documented and are nothing to do
with any contact with British Airways. We continue to offer assistance to
the administrators as sought.'
Mr Wallace said the payment was likely to be in final settlement to most
creditors. It was approved by the largest 11 creditors to Air Europe - those
owed over Pounds 5m each - who have agreed to accept a lower interim
dividend of 4p in the pound. In exchange, the supervisors will incur lower
costs in communicating with the remaining 7,000 creditors, who would
otherwise have had to wait longer for the settlement of disputed claims of
over Pounds 6m.
Mr Wallace said the largest creditors could ultimately receive a dividend of
between 4p and 5.35p, depending on the outcome of 'half a dozen' disputes.
The figure for all creditors would be further boosted by any recoveries from
BA.
