  [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa met with Myanmar [Burma] counterpart Ohn Gyaw in Tokyo 
on Friday [24 June] and called for an early transfer of power 
from the military junta to an elected civilian government, 
Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Ohn Gyaw arrived in Japan on Monday for a weeklong stay to 
attend a meeting of the Environment Congress for Asia and the 
Pacific (Eco Asia '94) held Tuesday and Wednesday. 
  Officials said Kakizawa also called for the release of 
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The nobel peace prize 
winner has been held under house arrest without charge since 
July 1989. 
  She led the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) 
to 
a landslide victory in elections in 1990. 
  But the military junta, which goes by the name of the State 
Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), ignored the result 
and refused to transfer power to the elected representatives. 
  SLORC Chairman Gen. Than Shwe reportedly told a Japanese 
business delegation in Yangon earlier this month that the junta 
"should not stay in power for a long time" and that it is 
preparing "democratic foundations" for a civilian government.
