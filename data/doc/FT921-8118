FT  19 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
STOCK index futures moved forward in thin trading, enlivened only by hopes
of a cut in interest rates, write Christopher Price and Joel Kibazo.
March opened at 2,571 and moved quickly ahead on optimism over a rate
reduction fuelled mainly by sterling's early strength against the D-Mark.
However, the lack of any further positive news caused the market to drift
away in mid-morning trading.
Wall Street failed to impact and it was not until a couple of large buyers
moved into the market in late afternoon that the index resumed its upward
movement, giving further support to the underlying market.
March traded in a range of 2,560-70, eventually closing at 2,578, up 13 on
the previous session and some 12 points above its estimated fair value
premium to cash of about 10. Turnover reached 5,221.
In LTOM, Hanson was the busiest stock option accounting for around a quarter
of the day's total turnover of 31,044 contracts. It traded 7,969 lots, with
a majority of the day's business seen in the February 200 calls, which
expire today.
This was followed by Sears, which traded a total of 1,455 contracts, and
British Aerospace, which reports full-year figures today, on 1,106
contracts.
