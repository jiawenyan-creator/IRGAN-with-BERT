FILM: THE PRODUCER AS KING 
Hollywood underwent a major transformation in creative control in the '80s, 
spawning a new generation of powerhouse film producers. In fact, these shrewd, 
dominating new movie moguls operated with such a strong hand -- hiring and 
firing directors, packaging stars and even creating an aesthetic for their 
pictures -- that perhaps they should be known by a heady new moniker: the 
Producer as Auteur. 
'70s box-office champs Steven Spielberg and George Lucas still exercised 
considerable influence, especially through Spielberg's Amblin Films, which 
encouraged a host of young film-making talent. But the real '80's kingpins were 
a high-profile trio of producer teams: Don Simpson &amp; Jerry Bruckheimer, 
Lawrence Gordon &amp; Joel Silver and Peter Guber and John Peters. Not to say 
that these duos were infallible -- all presided over plenty of flops. But they 
created blockbuster hits with remarkable consistency, sculpted the career moves 
of budding superstars and -- for better or worse -- helped establish the 
supremacy of the sequel, giving studios access to a proven box-office 
commodity. 
Talk about building a franchise -- Simpson &amp; Bruckheimer preside over the 
"Beverly Hills Cop" series, Gordon &amp; Silver have "48 HRS." and "Die Hard" 
sequels in the works (while Silver oversees the "Lethal Weapon" series) and 
Guber-Peters left Warner Films in possession of a potential bonanza -- the 
"Batman" sequel. 
Happily, there have been influential producers who've chosen to work outside 
the action-movie genre. Having thrived as a writer-producer in the world of 
sit-com TV, James L. Brooks earned his directing stripes this decade (with 
"Terms of Endearment" and "Broadcast News"). But he also established his Gracie 
Films banner as a symbol of classy, creative films, producing such 
adventuresome fare as "The War of the Roses, "Big" and "Say Anything." Ed 
Pressman also proved that while independent production is ailing, it's not down 
for the count. During the decade he's nurtured such daring directors as Alex 
Cox, Fred Schepisi and the Taviani brothers while presiding over such intrepid 
works as David Byrne's "True Stories" and Oliver Stone's "Talk Radio."
