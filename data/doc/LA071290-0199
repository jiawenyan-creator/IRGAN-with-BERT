ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TEEN-AGERS HURT AS TRUCK CRASHES, FLIPS 
Two teen-agers were seriously injured after the pickup truck in which they were 
riding struck another vehicle and flipped over, authorities said. 
The juveniles, who were not identified, had been riding in the bed of a Toyota 
Forerunner at about 9:45 p.m. Tuesday traveling southbound on Harvard Avenue 
near University Avenue when the driver, who also was a juvenile, lost control 
of the truck, Police Lt. Vic Tehies said. 
His pickup struck a Ford Thunderbird which was going east on University, then 
flipped end over end and landed on its wheels, Tehies said. When it flipped, it 
struck a Toyota Tercel waiting for a red light to change at the intersection, 
he said. Some of the four occupants of the Tercel suffered bruises and cuts, 
Tehies said. 
One teen-ager was taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission 
Viejo and another to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana. Both were expected to 
be released by today, police said. No one in the other vehicles was seriously 
injured.TED JOHNSON
