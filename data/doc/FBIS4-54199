  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- The Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC) upheld its own previous finding Thursday [26 May] in a 
price-rigging case involving Toshiba Chemical Corp. and ruled 
again that the firm violated the Antimonopoly Law. 
  The FTC said Toshiba Chemical and seven other companies, 
which dominate the domestic market for phenolic copper-coated 
paper laminates, formed a price cartel in June 1987 to boost 
prices. 
  The ruling was identical to one the antimonopoly watchdog 
handed down in 1992, which the Tokyo High Court nullified in 
February this year. 
  The court ordered the commission to reexamine the case, 
saying the FTC decision was unfair because an investigator in 
the original cartel probe was later named one of the FTC's five 
members who ruled on the case. 
  Hitachi Chemical Co. and six other makers abided by an FTC 
order in June 1989 to halt the unfair practice, but Toshiba 
refused to comply and sought a legal judgment from the FTC. 
  After a series of public hearings, the FTC concluded in 
September 1992 that the firm violated the Antimonopoly Law. 
  Toshiba Chemical, dissatisfied with the decision, filed a 
suit against the commission.
