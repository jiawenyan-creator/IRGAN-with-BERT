FT  01 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Dollars 6bn aid promised for India
India's donor countries yesterday pledged Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) for the
financial year 1994-95 to meet India's 'continued need of high-quality,
long-term development assistance' for projects in areas such as education,
family planning, nutrition, rural works, and control of endemic diseases.
However, donors and financial institutions meeting in Paris at the annual
two-day India Development Forum, chaired by the World Bank, urged India to
strengthen its fiscal discipline, without which they fear the country would
not be able to reap the full benefits of reform.
The Indian government has not sought a fast-disbursing assistance component
this year because of its improved balance of payments position.
'India has made a conscious decision to restrict commercial borrowing and to
concentrate on project disbursement and improving portfolio management,'
said Mr Montek Singh Ahluwalia, finance secretary, and head of the Indian
delegation.
The International Development Association will today pledge Dollars 3.5bn
worth of aid for development projects.
