FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Burton cautious on 1992 outlook
SIR JOHN Hoskyns, chairman of Burton Group, yesterday told the clothing
company's shareholders that he remained 'extremely cautious about the
economic outlook for 1992'.
Speaking at the annual meeting, Sir John said Burton had 'witnessed the
deepest recession in retailing since the war at the same time as a collapse
in the property market'.
But he said sales growth had been re-established in the current financial
year. Stripped of the increase in VAT, sales were running 1 per cent ahead
of the previous year.
Trade had been very poor at the beginning of the financial year but had
picked up over the crucial Christmas period showing a 5 per cent improvement
in the five weeks from the beginning of December.
He added, however, that the increase in sales had been bought at the expense
of some erosion on gross margin as a result of an extensive discounting
campaign.
Analysts suggested that sales were still showing a like-for-like decline
once the contribution from additional trading space had been stripped out
and warned that the company's discounting promotions might backfire.
'My concern is that Burton has set a precedent with the discounting.
Customers will find it unpalatable when they try to restore prices to the
full margin. Some of their retail brands have passed their expiry date,'
said Ms Julie Ramshaw, retailing analyst at Morgan Stanley, the US
investment bank.
Burton's shares closed 2p lower yesterday at 35 1/2 p.
Sir John yesterday headed a much-changed board as four directors had left
and seven joined since the previous annual meeting.
The company's Pounds 161m rights issue in August had cut year-end debt from
62 per cent to 43 per cent and Burton subsequently sold the Harvey Nichols
department store for Pounds 60m and the leasehold of 214 Oxford Street for
Pounds 51m.
