FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Sharp rise in Viacom earnings
Viacom, the entertainment group, reported a sharp rise in second-quarter net
earnings to Dollars 221.7m on the back of strong growth at MTV, the music
television channel, and a first contribution from Paramount Communications.
The results, which compare with net earnings of Dollars 41.6m in the second
quarter last year, include a Dollars 267m pre-tax profit on the sale of
Viacom's stake in Lifetime Television.
The rise in group revenues to Dollars 1.7bn from Dollars 496m was helped by
a 21 per cent leap in revenues to Dollars 198.3m at MTV Networks, which
includes the MTV channel.
MTV benefited from growth in advertising and in payments from television
stations. However, revenues at Viacom Entertainment, the television
production and distribution arm, fell by 15 per cent to Dollars 34.4m
following a fall in re-run fees from television stations for The Cosby Show,
the long-running sit-com.
The second-quarter results reflect the 50.2 per cent stake in Paramount held
during the quarter, and are not directly comparable with previous results.
The figures include revenues of Dollars 1.2bn and pre-tax earnings of
Dollars 105m from Paramount. Viacom's long-running struggle to take over
Paramount was formally completed on July 7, and the third-quarter results
will fully consolidate the acquisition.
Second-quarter earnings per share amounted to Dollars 1.44 against Dollars
0.35 in the same period last year. However, the group declared a net loss of
Dollars 232.4m for the six months, Dollars 1.72 a share, compared with net
earnings of Dollars 122.6m, or Dollars 1.02, in the first half of 1993.
John Labatt, the Canadian brewing group confirmed it had not made a bid for
Madison Square Garden, owned by Viacom.
'We examined MSG in great detail and determined not to submit a bid,' said
Mr George Taylor, Labatt president and chief executive.
