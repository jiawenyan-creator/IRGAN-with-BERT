 

The petitions were submitted pursuant to section 251 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2341). Consequently, the United
States Department of Commerce has initiated separate investigations to determine whether increased imports into
the United States of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by each firm contributed importantly
to total or partial separation of the firm's workers, or threat thereof, and to a decrease in sales or production of
each petitioning firm.
Any party having a substantial interest in the proceedings may request a public hearing on the matter. A request for
a hearing must be received by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Division, room 7023, Economic Development Administration,
U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, no later than the close of business of the tenth calendar day following
