FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: Skoda smoothes out the bumps -
Ariane Genillard examines the car manufacturer's new bearing
SKODA Automobila, the Czech car company in which Volkswagen of Germany is
building a 70 per cent stake, expects to break even this year, thanks to
rising productivity and higher sales.
Volkhard Kohler, vice-chairman, said that after a bumpy ride in its first
year, when a loss was recorded, the venture would break even in 1992 and
make profits from next year.
Plans were well advanced to raise a Dollars 1.2bn syndicated loan which
would be used to finance the start of an DM8bn investment programme designed
to double production capacity to 460,000 cars a year by the mid-1990s.
Existing capacity of 200,000 is expected to be fully utilised this year,
compared with 172,000 in 1991. This is partly a result of higher
productivity, with the company making 860 cars a day, compared with 560
earlier this year.
Improved productivity has resulted mainly from organisational changes as the
venture's capital expenditure programme has got into gear.
Some DM60m (Dollars 40m) was invested in the Czech plants last year, with a
further DM300m planned for 1992, mainly for the construction of a new paint
shop. Investment next year is expected to reach DM1.04bn and will peak in
1994 with an estimated DM1.6bn, falling to DM1.3bn in 1995.
Domestic sales, down to 27,000 cars in 1991, are expected to reach 85,000
this year, boosted by the launch of an upgraded 'Sport-Line' model and
tariff changes which have made imported cars more expensive.
Skoda has also increased sales to Germany, mainly to the eastern provinces
where the appetite for cheap cars is growing. Exports to Germany, are
expected to reach 60,000 this year, representing more than 60 per cent of
the company's exports to EC countries.
The joint-venture's two-year tax holiday is due to end in 1993, when Skoda
will be subject to corporate tax of about 45 per cent.
But the effective tax charge is expected to be minimal, thanks to
depreciation allowances on its increasing capital expenditures and the
five-year tax loss carry forward allowed under the new tax code.
Meanwhile, a question mark still hangs over the future of the remaining 30
per cent stake in the joint-venture owned by the Czechoslovak government.
Credit Suisse First Boston, which structured the original deal, under which
Volkswagen bought a 31 per cent stake in Skoda for DM620m in April 1991
rising to 70 per cent by 1995, is currently working on the sale of the
government's stake.
At Volkswagen's insistence, the terms of the joint venture make it
impossible for the government to sell its shares directly to the public.
Instead, investors, both local and foreign, will probably be offered shares
in what will still be a government-controlled investment fund which will
house the shares.
Investors will probably be offered dividends but not voting rights, which
will remain with the fund, although the details are still being finalised.
Once the decision is taken to proceed with the sale, however, shares in the
fund are expected to become among the most sought-after assets in
Czechoslovakia.
