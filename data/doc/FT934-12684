FT  26 OCT 93 / Indonesia's ruling party elects civilian chairman
INDONESIA'S ruling Golkar party yesterday sought to distance itself, at
least publicly, from the military by electing a civilian as its chairman for
the first time.
He is Mr Harmoko, currently Information Minister and a close confidant of
President Suharto. The election, at the end of a five-day party conference,
was backed by the president, who saw his own grip over Golkar tightened with
the appointment of two of his children to its executive board.
Indonesian politics is a notoriously closed-door affair in which outsiders
are given few clues as to what the changes in leading personnel mean.
Diplomats believe, however, that there is a growing rift between some armed
forces officers and 72-year-old President Suharto over the choice of his
eventual successor. As the ruling party will be instrumental in the
emergence of the next leader, diplomats suggest the president is trying to
reduce the military's role in Golkar.
The armed forces, however, remain the dominant political force in Indonesia
and their members control many of Golkar's important provincial branches.
The promotion of civilians within Golkar's central leadership may cause some
resentment.
In particular, the appointments of Ms Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana and Mr Bambang
Trihatmodjo, children of President Suharto, to the 45-member executive board
is likely to spark widespread debate.
Both have enjoyed successful business careers, establishing companies in the
early 1980s which currently have a combined annual turnover of several
billion dollars. Until now, however, they have kept a low political profile.
