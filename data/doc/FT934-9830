FT  09 NOV 93 / People: Lee comes out of retirement
Julian Lee is back in business. One of those who can reasonably lay claim to
having spotted the onset of recession, Lee presided, in 1990, over the
highly successful sale of Bricom, a two-year-old MBO from British &amp;
Commonwealth, and subsequently retreated to his working farm in Sussex.
Lee then spent a year at agricultural college, and, apart from picking up
the non-executive chairmanship of Carpet-land at the beginning of last year,
the 48-year-old chartered accountant had stayed out of business. Around six
months ago, he started attempting a comeback, and, through an introduction
from merchant bankers Charterhouse, eventually found the Hollas Group, a
small Manchester clothing and textiles company.
Tony Lawson, who had been chairman and chief executive, says that, at the
age of 62, and after 42 years with the business, he had been considering
bringing in a new chief executive, but he had intended to stay as executive
chairman. When Lee came on the scene, however, 'it was obvious that he was
going to be number one. After some thought, I agreed to become non-executive
(chairman).'
Roger Wallwork, 60, the finance director, is also retiring and is replaced
by Paul Baddiley, 41, who was Lee's finance director at Bricom, and had
previously held a number of financial posts at BTR.
In Hollas, Lee has a group with 'nil gearing that makes profits in every
company', Lawson says, and hence a suitable vehicle for acquisition-led
growth. Lee, who is setting up the bare bones of a head office in London,
will reveal the substance of his strategy when Hollas reports its interims
at the beginning of January.
