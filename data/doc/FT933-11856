FT  27 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hectic Reuters trade
Shares in Reuters Holdings, the international information and news group,
forged ahead in hectic trading after the company confirmed weekend
speculation of a share buy-back scheme.
The company was forced to issue its confirmatory statement, just 24 hours
ahead of its results, saying it was to distribute up to Pounds 350m, through
the repurchase of 5.8 per cent of its ordinary shares at Pounds 14 a share.
The stock raced forward as the big pension funds bought heavily, realising
that the offer was worth around Pounds 17.20 a share to them because of a
tax credit opportunity.
At the day's best the shares were up 56 at 1460p, but they surrendered some
of the gain when US investors failed to follow the lead set by London,
choosing instead to await today's interim figures.
By the close the rise had been trimmed to 36 at 1440p, with volume totalling
6.4m shares, the highest daily total for 2 1/2 years.
Mr Brian Newman of Henderson Crosthwaite expects half-time profits of Pounds
210m. Mr Alastair Smellie at Lehman Brothers predicted Pounds 211.5m and
also forecast a large increase in the dividend.
