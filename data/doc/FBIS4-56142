  [Text] Prague, May 25 (CTK) -- The Czech Government today 
agreed on putting migrants from ex-Yugoslavia who have been 
given temporary asylum in this country on an equal footing with 
refugees. The migrants will in effect be given asylum as well 
but only until they leave. The decision was based on a document 
presented by Interior Minister Jan Ruml.
