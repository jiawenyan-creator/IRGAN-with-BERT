  [Text] The Yemeni authorities say they expect a political 
message from the south to arrive this evening. 
  Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani said the Yemeni 
Government had issued no military communiques since Tuesday [24 
May] evening because it is all quiet on the front. He declined 
to say who the message will be from or what it would be about. 
  In Sanaa, Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has called 
in 
the ambassadors of the permanent member states of the United 
Nations Security Council. Diplomatic sources said Mr. Salih 
told the ambassadors that if the council were to say anything, 
Sanaa would prefer that it be a council president's statement 
rather than a resolution.
