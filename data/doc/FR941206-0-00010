 

Food Manufacturers/Distributors Comments 



Three food manufacturers/distributors who submitted comments did not provide comments that either support or take
issue with any particular facet of the proposal; their comments were general in nature. They stated that they support
harmonization of regulations for meat and poultry products and would endorse a regulation that would allow meat products
with bone solids contents of less than or equal to 1 percent (measured as calcium) to be categorized as meat (i.e., ``species''),
regardless of the processing procedure, i.e., traditional mechanical deboning or advanced meat/bone separation
and meat recovery systems. 

The other six comments submitted by the food manufacturers/distributors supported the proposed rule, provided
that some modifications are made in specific areas, i.e., the definition of meat, calcium content criteria, protein
quality, quality control, handling requirements, and bone breakage tolerance and the new machinery. 

All six food manufacturers/distributors to which the previous paragraph refers had some reservations about the
definition of the meat derived from the advanced machinery and recovery systems and the types of machinery capable
of producing such meat. Their statements indicated that it is not necessary to define meat by making distinctions
based upon whether specific pieces of machinery do or do not crush, grind or pulverize bones; if product complies with
finished product calcium requirements, the specific of the methods of processing should be irrelevant. This was
based on a belief that there is equipment that can successfully separate ``meat'' where grinding, crushing, or pulverizing
is part of the process. These same commenters suggested that incidental bone breakage occurs during any meat/bone
separation operation, therefore, it should be clearly identified that incidental bone breakage would be acceptable
and would be controlled by bone particle size limits. It was also suggested by one commenter that the word ``crushing''
should be substituted with the word ``chopping'' when describing meat and machinery systems that do not ``chop,''
grind, or pulverize bones because such systems do result in some minor ``crushing.'' 

Of the six food manufacturers/distributors that supported the proposal with some condition for modification, three
supported the calcium criteria in the proposed rule. The other three did not support it stating that (1) the Agency
should develop a single calcium criteria applicable to all ``meat'' species, which should be applied to all products
independent of the processing method or bone separation technique, (2) product should be from skeletal muscle tissue
and contain no more than 1 percent bone solids or an equivalent calcium content of 250 mg/100 gm of product, and (3) any
meat with 1 percent bone or more than 0.235 percent calcium should be called by its common or usual name regardless of
species. 

Of the six food manufacturers/distributors who supported the proposal with some condition, two supported the protein
quality criteria in the proposed rule. The other four did not support the proposed criteria citing that (1) the nutritive
value of meat is well recognized, and the amino acid content of meat separated by hand, or by machine, will be the same
when the same beginning sources are used; (2) to segregate ``meat'' from a mechanical source from hand deboned ``meat''
by requiring an amino acid analysis casts undeserved doubts upon the meat from mechanical means, especially if it
is asserted to be compositionally the same as hand-deboned meat; (3) if this ruling is to recognize meat from a mechanical
process as ``meat,'' then the protein quality requirement for mechanically ``harvested'' meat is unfounded; (4)
the marketplace will determine the quality of the protein in the meat produced by meat/bone separation machinery
and meat recovery systems; (5) protein quality was not an issue with the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990,
so it should not be of concern as a processing control for a product that will eventually be nutritionally labeled;
(6) if the protein quality is of such a concern, it should be a mandatory parameter and required to be labeled in the Nutrition
Facts panel on all products; and (7) products that require such extensive testing will take 2 to 3 days turnaround just
to ensure the product meets compliance.
