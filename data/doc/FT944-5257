FT  05 DEC 94 / Strike will shut post offices
Hundreds of post offices will be closed by strike action on December 12 in
protest against alleged 'back-door privatisation' of counter services, the
UCW communications union announced yesterday.
The decision follows last month's ballot decision by some union branches to
strike over the closure of main post offices.
The strike will affect post offices in London, Glasgow, Merseyside,
Cambridge, Bristol, Plymouth, Northampton and parts of Wales. It will not
hit postal deliveries.
The Post Office accused the union of timing the strike for December 12 - the
main benefit day for pensions, child allowances and income support - to hit
the 'most vulnerable members of the community just before Christmas'.
