 

3. In addition, the NPRM proposes to amend 1.716 to add a new subsection (b) to encourage complainants to file
both an original informal complaint as well as one copy for each carrier named in their informal complaints. The NPRM
also proposes to amend 1.716 by adding subsection (c) which would encourage complainants to file a copy of the
pertinent bill(s) when the complaint involves a billing dispute. Multiple copies of informal complaints are intended
to reduce the clerical burden in preparing complaints for processing. In addition, encouraging complainants to
file a copy of pertinent bills should enable the Commission to reassign substantial resources from administrative
functions to enforcement functions.


4. The NPRM also proposes to amend 1.717 to conform the rules to Commission practices. Specifically, the NPRM
clarifies that the function of carriers in informal complaint proceedings is to satisfy or answer written allegations
contained in a complaint. In addition, the NPRM proposes to eliminate the Commission's discretion to close certain
informal complaints without further contact with the carrier and the complainant.

5. Finally, the NPRM proposes to amend 1.718 to state that in all cases involving an unsatisfied informal complaint,
the period of time allowed for filing a formal complaint that will relate back to the filing date of the informal complaint
is sixty days after the staff has informed the parties in writing of its disposition of the informal complaint. The
proposal is intended to eliminate the need for complainants to calculate the deadline for filing formal complaints
based on unsatisfied informal complaints and relieve the burden on carriers of determining when they may dispose
of informal complaint files.

6. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 603, it is certified that the proposed rule will not,
if promulgated, have a significant impact on a substantial number of small business entities, as defined by Section
601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Although the proposed rules change the timing and mechanics of the informal
complaint process, they would not alter the level of evidentiary and legal support required of parties to such actions.


7. This notice and comment rule making procedure is nonrestricted. Section 1.1206(a) of the Commission's Rules,
47 CFR 1.1206(a), contains provisions governing permissible 

ex parte

 contacts.
