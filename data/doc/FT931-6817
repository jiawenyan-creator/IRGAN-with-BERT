FT  27 FEB 93 / BBC2 chief is appointed as controller of BBC1
MR ALAN YENTOB, the controller of BBC2, was yesterday appointed controller
of BBC1.
It is the first time since 1965 that the person in charge of the
corporation's minority channel has gone on to run the BBC's more mainstream
television channel.
One of his early tasks will be to decide what to do about Eldorado, the soap
opera set in Spain which was commissioned by his predecessor at BBC1, Mr
Jonathan Powell.
Yesterday Mr Yentob said it had failed in ratings terms. 'It doesn't seem to
have done the business,' he said, although he would not be drawn on the
soap's fate.
Seven or eight candidates were assessed for one of British broadcasting's
most attractive jobs.
According to Mr Will Wyatt, managing director of network television, only Mr
Yentob, 45, went before a sub-committee of the BBC governors on Thursday
evening.
All the signs are that Mr Yentob, controller of BBC2 since 1988 and regarded
as a considerable success, did not initially apply for the job.
'I decided that I wanted to do it and I do want to do it,' he said
yesterday.
Programmes introduced during Mr Yentob's time at BBC2 have ranged from The
Late Show, The Second Russian Revolution and Troubleshooter to comedy such
as Harry Enfield and French and Saunders.
Mr Yentob will be the senior programme controller and will deputise for Mr
Wyatt on all editorial matters.
He said his main task would be to offer the audience a genuine choice,
although he supported the emphasis Mr John Birt, the director-general, was
placing on the BBC producing 'distinctive' programmes.
A new BBC2 controller will be appointed in three or four weeks. Mr Michael
Jackson, the present head of arts programmes, is seen as a strong candidate.
