FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Henry Boot ahead 5% - Housebuilder tops
Pounds 7m and bucks industry trend
HENRY BOOT, the Sheffield-based contractor, housebuilder and property
developer, yesterday became one of the few construction companies to
announce profit and dividend increases for 1992.
Following a 4.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.77m to
Pounds 7.08m, the final dividend is lifted to 4.3p from a 1991 equivalent of
3.9p.
The total dividend for the year of 5.9p is 9 per cent higher than in 1991
and well covered by earnings per share ahead from 18.4p to 18.9p.
The profits increase was achieved despite a fall in interest receivable from
Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 1.9m. Net cash at the year-end is thought to have
reduced from more than Pounds 14m to about Pounds 10m following
acquisitions.
Turnover fell marginally, from Pounds 129.9m to Pounds 129.4m.
Trading profits rose from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 5.2m due to better
performances from contracting and housebuilding.
Mr Jamie Boot, managing director of the company in which the family owns
about half the shares, said the company had succeeded because it had not
chased low margin construction work or indulged in some of the excesses of
other housebuilders in the late 1980s.
Even so net housing margins had slipped last year to about 8 per cent. Unit
sales by comparison were up by 50 per cent on 1991 levels.
