FT  01 MAY 92 / Migraine drug licence for Glaxo arm
THE UK subsidiary of Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals group, has been granted a
licence to market an oral formulation of Imigran, its migraine drug. The
drug has previously been available in the UK only in an injectable form.
Glaxo did not say how much the oral form of the drug, which will be launched
in June, would cost. Imigran is one of three new Glaxo products described by
analysts as potential blockbusters, but its high price has caused
controversy. In other markets, it costs about Pounds 10 for each pill and
about Pounds 20 for every injection. Most migraine attacks require two pills
or injections.
