FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Old firm with a longer view - The
Professionals / A look at Barings' distinctive ownership structure and
approach
Barings is London's oldest established merchant bank and it has grounds for
claiming that it first learnt how to judge markets as an 18th century
merchant.
Barings' equity has always been privately-owned, and the voting share
capital is held by its senior executive management. The non-voting equity
capital, which has exclusive rights to the dividends, is in the hands of the
Barings Foundation, a UK registered charity.
Michael Chamberlayne, the chairman of the London-based private client
division, argues that the advantage of this structure is that private
clients know that Barings will remain wholly independent, and that it has a
shareholder that understands and supports the long-term nature of its
private client business.
The international dimensions of Barings' activities are reflected in the
existence of three centres - London, Guernsey and Geneva - from which
private client portfolios are managed. It has more than 50 offices in 31
countries, and its regional specialists conduct 2,000 company visits each
year, including meetings with businesses operating in the smaller and more
obscure markets.
Differences in the business terms of its three private client centres make
Barings somewhat secretive about some aspects of its activities. It is
tight-lipped about private client numbers and average portfolio turnover,
for instance and it cannot put a figure on the minimum investment required
for a portfolio directly invested in shares.
According to Geoffrey Burnand, the marketing director, this depends on 'who
you are, where you are coming from and what you want.' However, the minimum
fee for management of a direct equity portfolio in London is Pounds 10,000 a
year, although transaction charges are capped at Pounds 150, on the grounds
that Barings prefers to charge for investment skills, not investment
mechanics.
This Pounds 10,000 figure suggests that UK investors will need assets of
around Pounds 1m to benefit from a portfolio of direct equity holdings. An
alternative for more modest investors is Barings' managed fund service of
unit trusts and investment trusts, where the minimum investment is Pounds
20,000, or even a Pounds 500 stake in the Barings Portfolio Fund unit trust,
which replicates the portfolio of a UK private client.
In London, private client money is managed on a discretionary basis,
although Chamberlayne concedes that 'the question of discretion can be
frayed around the edges, if it is sensible to do so.' He explains: 'We say
to clients that it is very important that we meet to discuss their views,
but we like to go away with a broadly-agreed brief. Obviously the client may
telephone us at any time, and if there is some sea-change in the markets we
will contact them. But what we cannot undertake to do is clear with clients
whenever we buy and sell a stock.'
Barings' private client managers favour a broad portfolio spread of 40 to 50
stocks, with overseas and emerging markets money invested through collective
funds.
Chamberlayne says: 'Emerging markets are an area that the whole business
takes very seriously. There are some private clients that view these markets
as very high risk, but I think that if you invest globally, and don't try
the rifle shot approach, you can spread the risk. The other crucial thing is
the length of the view you are prepared to take. I always take the view that
the dangers of volatility are short-term.' Long-termism should come
naturally to anyone steeped in the history of Barings. The bank took more
than 30 years to realise a profit on the purchase of 1.25m acres of Maine,
in 1797.
All private client fund managers have access to Barings' specialist
stock-pickers, but there is no prohibition on buying stocks that the
managers themselves have researched.
'One of our strong beliefs is that people should be involved in stock
selection on the spot, and in the markets concerned,' explains Chamberlayne.
'We see the analytical role as a mixed role, rather than as a pure number
cruncher. We think it is quite important for people to be operating in the
real markets.'
Turnover in the private client portfolios is low, and Chamberlayne quotes
with some approval the guru who argued that turnover is a voluntary tax, so
why pay it?
The asset allocation committee, which represents the three private client
companies, meets once a quarter and tax considerations will dictate some
differences between the allocations recommended for funds managed out of the
different centres.
The current recommended asset allocation for a UK taxed fund is 16.5 per
cent bonds and cash; 57 per cent UK equities; 7.5 per cent US and Canada; 7
per cent contintental Europe; 2.5 per cent Japan; 5 per cent Far East; and
4.5 per cent emerging markets.
Chamberlayne comments: 'Possibly the surprising thing about these asset
allocations is the low exposure to Japan, which we have had for three years
now. Our problem with Japan is principally one of valuation. We felt that
the rating in Japan historically had got out of hand, and we didn't see why
a private client, who does not have a formalised benchmark, should take that
risk. We will be going back at some point, but I think we are looking for a
period of consolidation. Japan is a very difficult one to call.'
