FT  17 AUG 93 / Romanian President in talks to end rail strike
MR Ion Iliescu, Romania's president, last night began talks with trade union
officials and the SNCFR, the state railways, in an attempt to break the
deadlock in the country's rail strike which began a week ago, writes
Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
Opposition parties asked the president to mediate between the two sides,
warning of the grave dangers the conflict posed to an already tense country.
The all-out strike, considered Romania's most serious post-communist labour
conflict, has blocked all main railway stations as well as international
traffic through the Balkans. Among the few services running yesterday were a
handful of trains bringing children back from their summer holidays.
Government officials also met to analyse the effects of the strike and
consider emergency action after state enterprises, including two large steel
mills, said they had begun to run short of raw materials.
