NAME CHANGE 
The name Michoacan ("Exploring Michoacan, Mexico's 'Land of Lakes,' "July 9) 
does not mean "land of lakes" in the Tarascan "dialect." Michoacan is a 
Hispanicized version of the Nahuatl (Aztec) "Michuacan," meaning "land of the 
fishermen" or "land of those who fish." Furthermore, Tarascan is not a dialect; 
a dialect derives from another language. Tarascan, or Purepecha, as it is 
called properly, is a language unto itself. "Tarascan" is a Nahuatl word and 
not indigenous to the Michoacan area. Its meaning and origin are obscure.
