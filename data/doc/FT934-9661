FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Canadian railways plan
part-merger
CANADA'S two national rail systems plan a merger or track-sharing agreement
for east of the Manitoba border as soon as the first quarter of 1994.
Canadian National and Canadian Pacific, reacting to domestic rate
competition and pressures to reduce their unit costs to US levels, have
already begun small-scale track sharing and plan to close down or sell
unprofitable lines in the east.
They are also modernising their links between Ontario and the US.
Mr William Stinson, chairman of Canadian Pacific, said in Toronto he was
confident the government would approve the broad rationalisation they are
planning.
Future ownership and management of the system in eastern Canada has yet to
be decided, he said, but added: 'But I don't see any room for government
ownership in the rail business longer-term.'
