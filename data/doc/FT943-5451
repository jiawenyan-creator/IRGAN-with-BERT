FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: House price indices diverge  - At a
glance
The two largest building societies, Halifax and Nationwide, once again
disagreed on the direction of house prices for August. Nationwide found that
prices rose by 0.6 per cent while Halifax, which has a larger sample and
publishes seasonally-adjusted figures, found they fell 0.7 per cent. It was
the first fall since May, according to the society.
Nationwide said the recovery in market activity, which appeared to be
strengthening early in the year, was 'marginal,' although underlying
transaction levels appeared to have stabilised. Halifax said underlying
house prices were flat, a trend which would not change until consumer
confidence improves.
