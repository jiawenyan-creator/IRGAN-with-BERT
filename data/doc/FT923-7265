FT  19 AUG 92 / Business and the Environment: Top scores in the green
ratings game - Ian Rodger looks at a scientific method of assessing
companies on their environmental risk
Some day, companies may be rated for their environmental risk just as they
are rated now by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poors for their financial risk.
At least that's the hope of Robert Chanson, a Swiss lawyer who has
established Eco-Rating International, a Zurich-based company specialising in
ecology rating.
Chanson says a number of organisations now carry out environmental
assessments and audits on companies or factories, but usually on an ad hoc
basis and often in combination with assessments based on ethical issues,
such as treatment of employees in third world countries.
'We want to establish a scien-tific approach that will bring about a more
rational assessment,' Chanson says.
Eco-Rating's objective is to develop a universally applicable assessment
method so that an Indonesian textile company could be measured against, say,
a British steel company on ecological criteria. For the moment, however, as
a start-up business, it has to concentrate on specific assessments that
clients are willing to pay for. Chanson says his main potential clients are
managers of the so-called green funds which invest in companies providing
products or services that improve the environment.
He is trying to convince these funds to commission his group to make
assessments of the companies they invest in and then to rank their fund
against other green funds. He says there are some 200 green funds around the
world, and they tend to invest in the same pool of roughly 500 environmental
technology companies.
'We have received a signal from the market of interest in comparatively
simple information. They want to know if a product or service offered by a
company really does benefit the environment, and if the technology employed
is of a high or low standard.'
He proposes to make what he calls eco-tech ratings on these companies. To
demonstrate the method, he has recently carried out an assessment of the
Swiss maker of low-emission burners and paints, Elco Looser.
The first task was to examine the company's product portfolio and determine
the proportion of its sales coming from environmentally beneficial products.
In the Elco Looser case, 32 per cent of its products were considered to
produce a net environmental gain and the rest of the products were not
seriously damaging to the environment. Chanson says a company that produces
really nasty things, such as DDT or military explosives, would get a zero
rating even if it also made some environmentally beneficial things.
Then each product or service was rated on a scale from 1 to 5 on its
technological standard, using EC guidelines on the best available
technology. The resulting figures were weighted according to the percentage
of total sales represented by each product, and then converted into an
average rating for the whole company which turned out to be 4.17.
If he were doing ratings for a green fund, the ratings of all the companies
in which the fund held shares would be aggregated to produce an overall
rating for the fund itself. This could then be compared with the ratings of
other green funds.
Chanson said Eco-Rating was close to concluding an agreement with a green
fund operated by one of the Swiss banks to carry out such a rating and was
in negotiations with other funds run by German banks. 'We will get
experi-ence with this, and then we will try to develop other tools,' he
said. Already it has drawn up an outline scheme for rating ordinary
companies, for example those not specialised in environmental products (see
box).
While it is obvious that companies in heavy industries, such as steel, could
not hope to score as well as companies in lighter manufacturing or service
sectors, Chanson argues that the ratings could nevertheless be used to
compare companies within a given sector.
He also admits that the final item in the list, soft issues, does not easily
lend itself to scientific analysis. But he says they are important in
assessing risks. For example, a company selling a pesticide may only advise
users to put exactly one litre in the dispenser, or it may provide a
measuring cup to ensure that the user pours in the proper amount. The latter
would get a higher rating.
Perhaps, as in financial rating, there will have to be an element of
subjectivity in eco-rating.
