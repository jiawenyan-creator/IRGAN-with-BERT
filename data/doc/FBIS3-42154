Again in Kiev"] 
  [Text] A seminar attended by experts from the French 
Institute of Protection and Nuclear Security is being held in 
Kiev. Experience of this country, where 78 percent of the 
electricity is generated at atomic power stations, is of great 
practical importance for us. According to the Center for 
Nuclear and Radiation Safety at the Ukrainian State Atomic 
Supervision Administration [Goskomnadzor], this seminar designed 
for nuclear experts has initiated implementation of a three-year 
project providing technical assistance to Ukraine in this 
sphere. The project is financed by the European Community 
Commission as part of the TACIS [expansion unknown] program.
