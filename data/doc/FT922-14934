FT  03 APR 92 / Factory orders rise in US
NEW ORDERS for manufactured goods in the US rose by 0.5 per cent in February
to register their second consecutive monthly increase, the Commerce
Department said yesterday, reports Michael Prowse in Washington.
Shipments of goods were up 2.1 per cent - the 10th increase in the past 11
months.
Inventories - stocks of unsold goods - fell for the fifth month, dropping to
their lowest level for three years.
This suggested that companies will have to increase production so as to meet
rising demand.
