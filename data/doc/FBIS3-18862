  [Excerpts] "The Chernobyl accident has had greater 
consequences for Norway than at first anticipated," Per Strand, 
a researcher at the National Radiation Protection Board said. 
  "The effects of the radioactive fallout will last longer, 
and 
a larger amount of radioactive substances will be absorbed by 
vegetation and animals in the vulnerable outlying grazing 
grounds than we estimated in 1986," the researcher said.

  ``The authorities have set an upper limit for the amount of 
radiation permitted in foodstuffs before they take special 
measures. Foodstuffs produced in some of the heavily polluted 
outlying areas will register above the limit well into the next 
century unless we continue our special countermeasures,'' Strand 
said. 
<H5>  Information </H5>
  One of the measures has been to provide information to 
segments of the population that are subject to serious exposure 
about how often they can eat reindeer meat, freshwater fish, or 
game from the affected areas. Another measure has been to give a 
substance that binds cesium to animals that have grazed in these 
areas or to put the animals on nonradioactive feed for a while 
before they are slaughtered. 
  "The level of radiation, and consequently the health risks, 
have been significantly reduced because of these measures. For 
the population as a whole, the risk has been halved. For 
reindeer-herding Samis in south and central Norway the risk has 
been reduced to one-tenth. The Chernobyl incident means a very 
slight increase in cancer risk for the population, but those 
groups that eat a lot of reindeer meat, freshwater fish, or 
mushrooms from the areas that experienced great radioactive 
fallout will have an increased risk of cancer if countermeasures 
are not taken. This applies above all to Samis that are reindeer 
herders. With the use of countermeasures it is expected that one 
in 1,000 in this group will develop cancer. Without 
countermeasures, the number would be one in 100." 
<H5>  500 Cancer Cases </H5>
  "It is estimated that about 500 Norwegians will develop 
cancer in the next 50 years as a result of the radiation from 
Chernobyl. (Annually 10,000 Norwegians die of cancer stemming 
from other causes.) We might expect 80-90 cases of genetic 
damage in Norway. There has not been any increase in reports of 
fetal damage in Norway, but a small increase in spontaneous 
abortions was recorded shortly after the accident," Strand said.
