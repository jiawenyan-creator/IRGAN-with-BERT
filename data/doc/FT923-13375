FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (2): Sales
acceleration expected - World production expected to reach 40.7m vehicles by
1996
WORLD CAR sales are forecast to grow by 1.3 per cent to 34.6m this year,
following a 2 per cent drop in 1991. The decline last year was the largest
reduction in sales volume since the 1980-81 recession.
According to DRI Europe, the UK-based automotive analyst, car sales are now
recovering in North America, the UK and Spain, and remain strong in Italy
and Latin America.
DRI is optimistic about the outlook for car sales worldwide for 1993 and
beyond, and expects demand to jump by 18.3 per cent in the five years to
1996, from 34.2m to 40.5m.
Sales in west Europe are forecast to rise to a record 15m in 1996, while car
sales in the US are expected to rise by 4 per cent this year to 8.7m, and to
recover to more than 10m by the mid-1990s. The US market fell last year to
its lowest level since 1982 at 8.4m.
DRI suggests that the fastest growing segment in the US from 1991 to 1996
will be luxury cars, helped by important demographic changes.
The growth in the number of affluent households in the US was an important
factor in persuading Toyota and Nissan, the Japanese car makers, to develop
luxury car ranges in the second half of the 1980s, aimed primarily at the
US.
These cars were launched under the Lexus and Infiniti names in the US in
1989. Now, another Japanese car maker, Mazda, is also planning to enter the
US luxury car market with a separate sales channel, to be called Amati, in
1994.
Mazda had been studying an entry into the US luxury car market for a couple
of years, and has concluded that the prospects are too attractive to be
ignored. It estimates that the number of affluent households in the US with
an income of at least Dollars 75,000 (Pounds 45,000) a year is set to
increase from 2m in 1988 to 2.5m in 1995.
In Europe, the German car market is forecast to fall sharply this year by
around 11 per cent, to 3.7m from the record 4.2m achieved last year in the
wake of reunification. Sales are also forecast to fall further in Japan this
year.
The decline in the German market will eliminate the volume gains achieved
elsewhere in Europe, leading to a 1 per cent fall in overall western
European new car sales in 1992 to 13.4m, according to DRI.
The downturn in Germany, the biggest single market in Europe, is forecast to
bottom out in 1993 at 3.5m, some 16 per cent or 700,000 cars below the 1991
peak, with demand recovering from 1994 to reach 3.8m in 1996.
In Europe, the tax payable on new car purchases has fallen in several
countries - as well as in Japan and Australia. The UK has halved the 10 per
cent special car tax, which is paid in addition to the 17.5 per cent rate of
VAT, while VAT rates have fallen in France and in Belgium. The French VAT
rate was reduced in April, to the standard rate of 18.6 per cent from 22.0
per cent previously, and has fallen sharply from the 33 per cent levied on
new car purchases in 1987.
The European Community has agreed a VAT floor of 15 per cent for cars for
the period from 1993 to 1998, but in the process of harmonisation of VAT
rates no ceiling has yet been set, says DRI. However, it expects the
Community to work towards a convergence of tax rates.
After growing by 38 per cent between 1988 and 1990, Japanese new car sales
fell by 5 per cent last year to 4.9m. The DRI report* forecasts that demand
will weaken further this year by 4 per cent to 4.7m, but will recover in
1993 to reach more than 5m again in 1995.
Despite progress made by car importers to Japan in recent years, import
penetration remains low at only 4.5 per cent of Japanese new car sales in
1991; and, as new car demand falls in Japan, import sales have been
declining at a faster rate than sales of domestically-built cars.
According to DRI, Japanese car sales weakened last year as a result of two
main factors: consumer confidence has been damaged by a deterioration in
growth prospects for the economy; while, at the same time, there is
widespread concern about the future of land and property prices following
recent falls. The tightening of parking restrictions has had a significant
impact on mini-car sales.
In the Asia-Pacific region, both the South Korea and Taiwan markets have
remained strong. South Korean new car sales have increased threefold since
1987, to reach 745,000 in 1991. DRI suggests that the economy will remain
strong with car sales, rising by a further 50 per cent in the next five
years to 1.13m in 1996.
New car sales in Taiwan were little changed in 1991, at 354,000, but demand
is forecast to strengthen in the next five years with sales set to reach a
record 500,000 in 1996.
According to the DRI study, new car sales in the European Community will
grow from 12.6m in 1991 to 13.9m in 1996, with Japanese car manufacturers
capturing around 30 per cent of the growth.
The Japanese share of EC car sales is forecast to rise from 10.9 per cent in
1991 to 12.5 per cent in 1996. Japanese penetration is expected to grow in
most EC markets, but above all in the UK, where the Japanese share is
forecast to rise from 11.6 per cent in 1991 to 16.9 per cent in 1996.
The capacity of Japanese car plants in Europe will probably exceed 700,000
units a year in 1996.
In the UK, the new Nissan Micra, Toyota Carina and Honda Synchro all start
production this year. DRI forecasts that Japanese car production in the UK
will rise to more than 600,000 in 1996, pushing UK car output to 2m, which
would be 60 per cent, or nearly 800,000 units, above the 1991 level.
DRI says that, after a weak recovery this year to some 1.7m from 1.59m in
1991, new car sales in the UK will grow more strongly in 1993, by 12 per
cent to 1.9m. The market is forecast to be above 2m again in 1994, but will
not have recovered its 1989 peak of 2.3m until 1996.
Overall, in the next five years, world car production is forecast to
increase by 6.5m vehicles to 40.7m in 1996. Some 2m of this increase will be
accounted for by western Europe - including, significantly, local Japanese
production - with 1.7m in North America, and only 500,000 in Japan.
