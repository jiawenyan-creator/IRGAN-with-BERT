 

The Southwestern Region of the Forest Service establishes areas around known owl locations, called management territories
(MTs). Each MT represents the occurrence of either a single owl or pair of owls, and is based on either confirmed nest
or roost locations, or nighttime calling responses. Forest Service inventories through 1993 resulted in the establishment
of 740 MTs in Arizona and New Mexico (Heather Hollis, Forest Service Southwest Regional Office, pers. comm., 1994).
Four MTs have been established from the six sites with owl detection records in Utah (K. Grandison, pers. comm., 1994).
No MTs have been established for the six owl sites in Colorado (John Verner, Pike/San Isabel National Forests, pers.
comm., 1994). 
There is potentially up to 435,000 ha (1,075,000 acres) of Mexican spotted owl habitat on Indian reservations. The
actual amount of habitat may be lower because estimates supplied by the BIA Forestry Division were developed from
timber-type maps containing little information about understory conditions or slope. The estimates may also omit
minimally forested or nonforested canyon habitat acreage. Information available to the Service on owl survey efforts
on Indian lands is as follows:




&bull;The White Mountain Apache Tribe's Mexican spotted owl conservation plan states that approximately 54 owl
sites have been located on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation; 

&bull;Owl surveys on the Navajo Reservation have resulted in the confirmation of owls at 26 sites (13 pairs and 13 singles)
(John Nysted, Navajo Fish and Wildlife Department, pers. comm., 1994); 
&bull;The Jicarilla and the Hualapai wildlife departments conducted owl surveys in 1993; however, no owls were detected;
and 
&bull;Current owl records exist for the San Carlos and Mescalero Apache Reservations, but only limited information
is available on population estimates.

 

A total of 297,000 ha (734,000 acres) of potential owl habitat occurs on BLM lands in Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New
Mexico (BLM, Colorado State Office, 

in litt. 

1990; BLM, Utah State Office, 

in litt. 

1990; BLM, New Mexico State Office, 

in litt. 

1990; Ted Cordery, Arizona BLM, pers. comm., 1992). In 1993, a total of 25 owl records were known from BLM lands. There
were 15 locations in Utah, 7 locations in Colorado, and 1 location in New Mexico. There are several historical records
and two current records for sites on BLM lands in Arizona. 
Most Mexican spotted owl habitat in national parks and monuments consists of minimally forested, steep, shaded canyons
in the northern part of the owl's range. It is difficult to estimate acreage for this type of habitat. The NPS estimated
that 23 parks and monuments in the Southwest contained between 96,000 and 177,000 ha (238,000 to 438,000 acres) of
Mexican spotted owl habitat (NPS, Southwest Region, 

in litt. 

1990; NPS, Rocky Mountain Region, 

in litt. 

1990; J. Ray, NPS, Grand Canyon National Park, pers. comm., 1990). As of 1993, the NPS had records of a total of 32 sites
in Utah and 2 sites in Colorado. 
Between 72,000 and 82,000 ha (177,000 to 202,000 acres) of New Mexico and Arizona State lands contain forests and canyons
that could be suitable Mexican spotted owl habitat. Several historical and recent records exist for New Mexico State
lands. In Arizona, surveys conducted by the Arizona State Land Department and the Coconino National Forest resulted
in the establishment of three MTs on Forest Service land. No information was available on suitable Mexican spotted
owl habitat on State lands in Utah and Colorado. However, a single owl was recorded on Utah State lands in 1992. 
Private lands in Arizona and New Mexico are currently estimated to contain up to 53,000 ha (130,000 acres) of owl habitat
(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1994). No estimates exist for owl habitat acreage on private lands in Colorado and
Utah. This is partly due to the difficulty in assessing the extent of existing canyon habitat in the Colorado Plateau
physiographic province, and partly a result of the insufficient amount of owl surveys accomplished to accurately
determine the limit of the species' range.
