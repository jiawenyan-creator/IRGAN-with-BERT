 

Maturity Requirements (Peaches) 


Section 917.459 specifies maturity guides for fresh peaches in paragraph (a)(1)(i), including Table I, for fruit
being inspected and certified as meeting the maturity requirements for ``well matured'' fruit. Such maturity guides
(e.g., color chips) are specified in Table I of 917.459 for peaches. The first interim final rule revised Table
I of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of 917.459 for peaches to add maturity guides for 19 peach varieties and to change the
maturity guide for one peach variety. 
The PCC recommended these maturity guide changes for these peach varieties based on a continuing review of their individual
maturity characteristics, and the identification of the appropriate color chip corresponding to the ``well matured''
level of maturity for such varieties. 


Size Requirements (Peaches) 


Section 917.459 specifies size requirements for fresh peaches in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(6), and paragraphs
(b) and (c). The first interim final rule revised 917.459 by redesignating current paragraph (a)(6) as paragraph
(a)(3) and current paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) as paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6), respectively,
so that the size regulations are in sequential order. The first interim final rule also revised 917.459 to establish
variety-specific size requirements for five peach varieties that were produced in commercially significant quantities
of more than 10,000 packages for the first time during the 1993 season. In 917.459 redesignated paragraph (a)(5)
was revised to include the Crimson Lady and Rich May peach varieties; and redesignated paragraph (a)(6) was revised
to include the Fancy Lady, Snow Ball, and Sugar Lady peach varieties. 
The first interim final rule also revised 917.459 to remove four peach varieties from the variety-specific
size requirements specified in that section, because less than 5,000 packages of each of these varieties were produced
during the 1993 season. In 917.459 redesignated paragraph (a)(5) of 917.459 was revised to remove the
Flavor Red peach variety; and redesignated paragraph (a)(6) was revised to remove the July Lady, Red Cal, and Redglobe
peach varieties. The peach varieties removed from the variety-specific list became subject to the non-listed variety
size requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of 917.459. 
The first interim final rule also amended 917.459 by revising paragraph (b) to change the ending date of the
regulatory requirements for the non-listed peach varieties referred to in that paragraph to June 30 from July 2, and
paragraph (c) to change the beginning date of the regulatory requirements for the non-listed peach varieties referred
to in that paragraph to July 1 from July 3. These changes reflect the sizing characteristics of such peach varieties.

Further, in 917.459 redesignated paragraph (a)(6)(i) was revised to permit as many as 80 peaches to packed
in a No. 22D standard lug box if they are ``well matured'', and redesignated paragraph (a)(6)(iii) was revised to permit
as many as 73 peaches in a 16-pound sample if they are ``well matured''. These changes permit certain late-season peach
varieties to be shipped to the fresh market at a slightly smaller size than in past seasons, if they meet the higher ``well
matured'' maturity standard. The higher maturity standard is important for such smaller size fruit, because it will
assure that the smaller fruit is of acceptable maturity and quality to be shipped to the fresh market in the interest
of growers, handlers, and consumers.
