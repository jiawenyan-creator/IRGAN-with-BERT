FT  16 JUN 93 / Observer: Disconnected
So all publicity is not necessarily good publicity, after all. In addition
to Michael Mates, it would seem that Christopher Morgan, the PR man at the
centre of the row over political intervention in connection with Asil Nadir,
had another good buddy who was also a Hampshire MP. In the register of
members' interests, Gerry Malone, the clubbable Conservative party deputy
chairman, has listed Morgan &amp; Rogerson as a client.
The Winchester MP, who says 'Christopher was and is a personal friend',
explains that he ended the formal relationship at the end of May because of
mounting political commitments.
