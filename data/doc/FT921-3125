FT  16 MAR 92 / Casino owner attempts to assure backers
LONDON CLUBS, the owner of six London casinos facing the loss of gaming
licences, is in talks to reassure its backers, which include banks,
institutions and private investors.
The casino group intends to make a vigorous defence of its record before
South Westminster Licencing Magistrates next month. It can only do so,
however, provided its financial backers - led by the Royal Bank of Scotland
 -stand firm.
The management of London Clubs is confident that the allegations made by the
police and the Gaming Board, in declaring the company 'not fit and proper'
to hold gaming licences, can be answered.
The immediate danger facing the company is that investors may attempt to
dispose of the properties to another operator rather than run the risk of
cancellation of licences and the loss of all London Clubs' casinos.
Given the uncertainty over their future, selling the casinos would be likely
to realise only a fraction of their real worth. Investors may stand a better
chance of saving their money if London Clubs has the opportunity of
defending its licences, as it believes it can, in open court.
If London Clubs was successful in securing renewal of its licences, either
at the magistrates' hearing or on appeal to the Crown Court, its future
would be very bright.
The action by police and the Gaming Board in applying for cancellation and
non-renewal of licences comes as a further blow to the already beleaguered
British gaming industry. There is a shortage of the 'high rollers' created
partly by recession and partly by uncertainty in the Middle East, where many
such gamblers come from.
The provisions in the Budget to speed up payment of taxes are a further blow
to cash flow.
There is a sense in the industry that the Gaming Board - with a new
secretary and about to have a new chairman - is no longer as closely in
touch with the industry.
