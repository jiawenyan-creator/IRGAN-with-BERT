  [Text] Vienna, March 14, IRNA -- Iran respects the 
decisions and wishes of the people as well as those of an 
independent Bosnia-Herzegovinan [B-H] Government, says Mahmoud 
Vaezi, Iran's deputy foreign minister in charge of Euro-American 
affairs. 
  Welcoming the decreasing trend of bloodshed in the Balkans, 
Vaezi in an interview with Iran [as received] here Monday 
expressed hope for a peaceful solution to the B-H crisis and 
called on the international community for assistance. 
  According to Vaezi, the Balkan crisis has reached a point 
where most countries want to see an end to the conflict. 
  He also noted that the Russians could play a decisive role 
aimed at ending the B-H conflict. 
  Vaezi, on a tour of European countries, held talks on Sunday 
with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic who is here for the 
Muslim-Croatian federation talks. 
  The Iranian deputy foreign minister also said that during 
his 
talks with Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister had thanked 
Iran for its humanitarian aid to the people of B-H, and 
expressed hope that the Serbians would also join the federation 
negotiations.
