  [Text] Pyongyang, March 6 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam group 
arrested Kim Sang-kyu, former chairman of the General Student 
Council of the Suwon branch of Kyonghui University, on March 3 
by invoking the "National Security Law", a fascist and 
anti-reunification law, according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  The fascist clique detained him for the reason that he was 
involved in the Seoul sponsorship of the pan-national rally at 
Hanyang University in August last year and the first meeting of 
co-chairmen of the National Alliance of youth and students for 
the country's reunification over the international telephone. 
  His righteous behaviour to contribute even a little to 
ending 
the tragedy of national division spanning nearly half a century 
and attaining national unity and the reunification of the 
country cannot be a crime.
