FT  21 APR 93 / Northern recovery 'well under way'
BUSINESS confidence in the north of England is at its highest for two years
and the region's recovery from recession is well under way, the latest
Business Survey North says.
The report, published yesterday by the Northern Development Company and the
Tyne and Wear and Teesside chambers of commerce, is based on responses from
885 companies in north-east England and Cumbria. It sees improvements in
every main indicator for the second successive quarter.
Results for the first quarter of the year are the best for two years, with
export sales and orders reaching new highs. Domestic orders have moved after
two negative quarters to a positive balance - the number of companies
reporting an improvement has outnumbered those reporting a decline and the
positive balance on domestic sales has doubled.
The balance on profits is in the black for the first time in nine months -
36.6 per cent reported increased profits in the previous three months, and
35.5 per cent reported a fall.
Increased turnover for the next 12 months was forecast by 59.1 per cent,
with 55.2 per cent expecting higher profits.
Investment in plant and machinery reached levels not seen for more than two
years.
