  [Text] The Republic of Namibia is regarded as the country 
most likely to trigger off more tension in southern Africa. 
Taking into consideration the alliance that exists between that 
country and the Luanda regime, it can be concluded that Mr. 
Nujoma clearly wants to provide substantive help to the Luanda 
communist regime in its vain attempt to destroy the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] by attacking 
UNITA's rearguard here in Cuando Cubango Province. 
  In addition to the fact that Namibia has been used by the 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, 
MPLA-PT, to secure the services of South African mercenaries, 
that country is now also becoming the center for MPLA-PT secret 
police agents to carry out diversionary attacks on UNITA here in 
Jamba. 
  Such behavior by the regime led by Jose Eduardo dos Santos, 
in tandem with the South-West African People's Organization, 
SWAPO, is a serious threat to stability in southern Africa, 
particularly if one takes into account the troublesome situation 
in South Africa, Mozambique, and Angola are currently going 
through. 
  Little by little, UNITA is losing its patience. It has often 
warned the Namibian regime not to be involved in promoting the 
Luanda regime's macabre operations. A source in the Armed 
Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] General Staff has 
said that, quote, when the FALA forces turns their cannons on 
invaders -- who will be hunted down until they go back to where 
they have come from -- we will not be responsible for whatever 
may happen. We have enough equipment at this stage to put on 
the run any forces provoking us, unquote.
