FT  21 OCT 93 / UN claims Mozambique poll accord
UNITED NATIONS secretary general Boutros Boutros Ghali said yesterday he had
achieved a breakthrough in revitalising the flagging peace process in
Mozambique, Reuter reports from Maputo.
Mr Boutros Ghali said at the end of a four-day visit that an accord had been
reached on the composition of a commission to supervise elections in October
next year.
The commission would have 10 members from the government, seven from Renamo
and three from other opposition parties. An independent chairman would be
chosen by the 20 commission members.
A draft electoral law will be approved by the cabinet before the end of this
month and by parliament before the end of November, Mr Boutros Ghali said.
He said disputes delaying demobilisation of the army, Renamo guerrillas and
para-military forces had also been resolved.
'A new calendar on the date of demobilisation will be approved before the
end of this week,' he said.
Mr Boutros Ghali said a compromise had also been reached on the composition
of three of the joint commissions dealing with aspects of the peace process.
The commission to oversee liaison between the government and
Renamo-controlled areas will be chaired jointly by the government and
Renamo, in rotation.
