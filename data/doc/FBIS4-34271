  [Excerpt] Brasilia, 15 Jun (AE) -- Finance Minister Rubens 
Ricupero today discarded any possibility of increasing the 
minimum wage. He said Congress has a solution to the 
readjustment. Ricupero pointed out: "Unfortunately the 
constitutional reform was not concluded and the federal 
government has no way to modify what is established in the 
Constitution or in federal laws." 
  The minister explained that any minimum wage increase is 
directly conditioned to the need to dissociate the national 
minimum wage from the minimum pension paid by the Social 
Security Ministry. The government also wants a definition on 
the proposal that states and mayoralties of the poorest 
Brazilian regions be allowed to pay a different minimum wage. 
The two modifications should have been approved during the 
constitutional reform because the 1988 Constitution establishes 
that the smallest pension paid by the Social Security Ministry 
must equal one minimum wage. [passage omitted]
