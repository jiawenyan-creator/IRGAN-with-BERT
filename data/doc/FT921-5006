FT  06 MAR 92 / Letter: Soft commissions and conflicts of interest
Sir, Your leader on soft commissions ('Soft on soft commissions', March 3)
rightly highlights the potential conflicts of interest that can lead to best
execution being compromised when a fund manager is locked into dealing with
a specific broker.
The lack of transparency, you state, opens the door to cross-subsidies and
inefficiencies in the system.
Your comments should really be applied to the large, integrated securities
houses that engage in soft commissions. Yes, best execution is compromised
because the fund manager's orders are locked into one market maker, and yes,
there is a lack of transparency that leads to cross-subsidising of the
loss-making sales arm by the highly profitable market-making arm of the
integrated house (a practice which is questionable under current rules).
Therefore your attack on soft commissions would be more accurate if it were
directed at the integrated houses rather than at soft commissions as a
whole.
As an independent stockbroker offering soft commission arrangements, we are
completely free of any conflicts, and as pure agency brokers we always seek
the best price for any order, wherever that price may be found.
Furthermore, we provide an essential link in the chain that allows
independent research to compete with the apparently endless flood of
indifferent research from securities firms.
Please don't tar us, the specialist independent agency brokers, with the
same brush as you should be tarring those large integrated houses whose
conflicts of interest are giving soft commissions a bad name.
