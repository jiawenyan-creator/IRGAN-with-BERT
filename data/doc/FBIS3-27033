  [Text] Individual and private economic sectors in Henan 
developed speedily last year. There were 914,000 individual 
industrial and commercial households, involving 1.6 million 
people, and 6,558 private enterprises, involving 155,000 people. 
Last year the development of individual and private economic 
sectors outstripped all previous years. More than 57 percent of 
the individual industrial and commercial households dealt in 
tertiary industries, and 43 percent of people in private 
economic sectors engaged in industrial and technological 
development or ran their own business. [words indistinct] the 
quality of people in individual and private economic sectors 
improved. Many university and secondary school students, 
post-graduates, and senior and middle- level technicians also 
engaged in these sectors. 
  To speed up the development of the province's individual and 
private economic sectors, last year the provincial party 
committee and government promulgated a circular on expediting 
the development of individual and private economic sectors, 
during which 20 measures were announced. [words indistinct]
