  [Text] Cabindan Front Commander General Jose Pedro has said 
the Angolan Armed Forces will reinstate state administration 
throughout Cabinda Province. 
  [Begin recording] [Pedro] The issue of Cabinda is delicate. 
There are two forms of resolving the issue. One is military and 
the other one is political. The political solution is the best. 
Thus, we have been doing all we can to assist the government to 
find a peaceful solution to the problem of Cabinda. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Commander, soldiers in the field say 
they are waiting for orders to enter Necuto. When will they 
receive that order? 
  [Pedro] Well, it does not mean that we do not have enough 
force to enter Necuto. When the time is ripe and conditions 
have been created, we shall go to Necuto to reinstate state 
administration there. [end recording]
