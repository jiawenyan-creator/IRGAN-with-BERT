FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: B&amp;J explains bid recommendation
Brown &amp; Jackson, owner of the lossmaking Poundstretcher chain of discount
stores, said yesterday it was recommending a rescue offer from Pepkor, of
South Africa, because the group offered greater financial security and
retailing experience.
B&amp;J had previously recommended a capital injection by the Weisfelds, the
millionaire couple who created the What Everyone Wants discount clothing
chain.
The Weisfelds had offered to inject an initial Pounds 6m, in return for a 19
per cent stake and two seats on the board. If their investment had reached
its proposed maximum of about Pounds 28m, their stake would have reached 42
per cent.
Pepkor has proposed injecting an initial Pounds 20m, but will receive a 63
per cent stake if it puts in the full Pounds 56.2m proposed.
In a circular B&amp;J said the Pepkor offer included an offer of trade finance
of up to Pounds 12m, which would allow the group to pay off its bank loans.
The Weisfeld's plan included a bank guarantee of up to Pounds 3m, but
further facilities until the end of this year would be subject to strict
conditions.
B&amp;J said these conditions would be costly and create a climate of continuing
uncertainty. Pepkor's offer of finance arrangements with a five-year term
would reduce the uncertainty and greatly increase the ease with which the
business could be managed.
The circular said that the experience in variety discount retailing offered
by Pepkor is greater than that of Mr and Mrs Weisfeld and will in the long
term outweigh the contribution that the Weisfelds' experience is likely to
make to a business of the nature and scale of B&amp;J.
Mr Christo Wiese, Pepkor's chairman, said B&amp;J, represents a discount store
chain with good volume and market share. It is an established brand within
the discount market and has an established supply and distribution network.
