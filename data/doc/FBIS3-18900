  [Text] Brussels, March 9 (AFP) -- The International 
Federation of Journalists (IFJ) said Wednesday [9 March] it was 
sending a fact-finding mission to Budapest to inquire into the 
controversial dismissal of 129 journalists from state-owned 
Hungarian radio. 
  "We have grave concerns regarding media developments in 
Hungary and the deadlock over control of the broadcast system," 
IFJ secretary general Aidan White said. 
  White said his organisation was "particularly dismayed" by 
reports that some of the journalists had been singled out for 
political reasons. 
  The radio journalists dismissed last Friday are to stage a 
sit-in at their old offices Thursday, protesting what the 
opposition says is a bid by Hungary's ruling centre-right 
coalition to silence criticism two months ahead of general 
elections. 
  Hungarian opposition parties and journalists have denounced 
the dismissals as "politically motivated cleansing," and 
supporters of the journalists staged a demonstration outside the 
radio station on Tuesday. 
  In Vienna the International Press Institute addressed an 
open 
letter of protest, published Tuesday, to Hungarian Prime 
Minister Peter Boross, calling the sackings "an unprecedented 
purge" carried out for political ends. 
  The IFJ delegation, headed by Gustl Glattfelder, will arrive 
in Hungary on March 16 and meet press representatives as well as 
government officials. 
  The IFJ, based here, claims to represent 320,000 journalists 
in 75 countries.
