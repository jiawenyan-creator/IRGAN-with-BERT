<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
'Anat Davidov and political correspondent Shlomo Raz; place not 
given -- live] 
  [Text] [Davidov] Good evening, Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres. 
  [Peres] Good evening. 
  [Davidov] Have all sides agreed that 4 May is the date on 
which the agreement will be signed? 
  [Peres] That 4 May is the target date, yes. 
  [Raz] We have received reports saying that two issues remain 
open: the area of Jericho and the policeman on the bridge. 
What about the other issues, concerning which the sides had 
apparently agreed in advance that they should be concluded after 
the agreement is signed -- currency, transit documents, 
international presence? What is the situation with these issues? 
  [Peres] We have agreed on most issues. There are two or 
three issues on which I hope we will agree later today. 
  [Raz] When do you plan to return home, then? 
  [Peres] Tomorrow morning, I think. 
  [Raz] Since you originally planned to stay there till 
Saturday night, the negotiations must be almost concluded. 
  [Peres] I planned to stay on if necessary, but today was 
fruitful, we put in many hours, and Christopher and Mubarak's 
participation in the negotiations was definitely a help. 
  [Raz] What about Gaza roads? I understand there were 
disagreements on that issue, too. 
  [Peres] Gaza roads were not discussed. 
  [Raz] Then I understand this issue is also concluded. 
  [Peres] Yes. Whatever was achieved during the previous 
Cairo talks is still valid. 
  [Raz] Mr. Peres, can we then say with near certainty or with 
total certainty that the Israeli-PLO agreement will be signed on 
4 May? 
  [Peres] We can speak of reasonable likelihood, as they say, 
that it may be signed on 4 May, but we should leave room for 
doubt until the last minute. 
  [Raz] Let us move on to Syria, then. Christopher is 
arriving here tomorrow. I assume the Syrian track will be the 
main issue on the agenda with him. 
  [Peres] Yes. Tonight we will attempt to conclude all the 
outstanding issues, and I assume that tomorrow the Syrian 
chapter will be launched. 
  [Raz] What will happen on that track? Will Christopher 
achieve a dramatic development on the Syrian track as well 
during his present Middle East tour? 
  [Peres] I cannot promise anything. First of all, there is a 
difference between the concluding and the opening stages. With 
the Palestinians, we are close to conclusion, while with Syria, 
we have not even reached the opening stage. Therefore, we 
cannot speak of a breakthrough. 
  [Raz] Do you mean that with the Syrians, we are still at a 
stage prior to.... 
  [Peres, interrupting] We are at a ground-breaking stage. 
  [Davidov] Thank you very much, Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres. 
  [Peres] You are welcome. Shalom.
