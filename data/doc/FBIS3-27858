  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 31 KYODO -- Sales by wholesalers and 
retailers in 1993 dropped from the preceding year for the second 
straight year mainly because of sluggish corporate and personal 
consumption, the government said Monday [31 January]. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said the 
sales index stood at 97.1 against the 1990 base of 100, down 4.0 
percentage points from the year before. 
  The index for the wholesale industry was down 4.1 percentage 
points while that for the retail business declined 3.8 points, 
the ministry said. 
  The ministry said sales by large-scale retailers such as 
trading houses plunged 5.3 points. 
  Sales and exports of durable products by wholesalers were 
sluggish due to slow production activity by the manufacturing 
industry, the ministry said. 
  In the retail category, all industries, including 
automobiles, foodstuffs, clothing and accessories, posted sales 
declines due to weak spending by corporations and individuals, 
it said.
