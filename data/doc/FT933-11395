FT  29 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Weak interest in Polish offer
POLAND'S first auction of three-year government bonds following government
moves earlier this month to allow the remit of capital and interest earnings
has failed to attract investors from abroad, writes Christopher Bobinski in
Warsaw.
Domestic interest in the issue was also weak, with the government offering
800bn zlotys of bonds and the banks willing to take up 90bn zlotys worth.
Eventually, 60bn zlotys worth were placed at a 1.9 per cent discount on the
nominal value. The three-year bonds carry an interest rate which reflects
three-month Treasury bill yields plus 10 per cent.
The government had hoped the three-year bond issue, which is earmarked for
funding this year's 81,000bn zloty budget deficit, would attract foreign
funds. However, currency fears have evidently kept foreign investors away.
