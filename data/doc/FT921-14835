FT  14 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: MAP adopts indexation for 90%
of its portfolio
MAP Fund Managers, formerly Paribas Asset Management, is altering its
investment strategy and will now rely almost exclusively on indexation
techniques in the management of its Dollars 2bn portfolio.
The change in name and management policy reflects the fact that an 80.1 per
cent stake in the London-based company was recently taken by MAP Securities,
a division of Corporacion Mapfre, Spain's largest insurance group. A 19.9
per cent stake of MAP Fund Managers remains in the hands of the fund
management arm of Banque Paribas.
Mr Keith Bayliss, managing director, said that while Paribas Asset
Management followed indexation techniques with roughly 10 per cent of funds
under management, MAP would use indexation and 'tilted' indexing techniques
for more than 90 per cent of the portfolio.
Mr David Damant, formerly chairman of Paribas Asset Management and an expert
on indexation, will be managing director of the new company.
Indexation is a method under which fund managers construct a basket of
securities that replicates a stock market index, such as the FTSE-100 or the
Standard and Poor's 100 index in the US. The portfolio should then perform
closely in line with the index.
The technique does not require so-called active management under which fund
managers research the prospects of individual companies and make selections
based on analysis.
While indexation is widely used by fund managers in the US, it is little
used in the UK, where active management is the more usual choice of fund
managers who seek to maximise returns through individual stock selection.
Mr Bayliss said the pool of funds under management was expected to grow
significantly through active soliciting for customers.
The company will specialise in managing funds for insurance companies.
