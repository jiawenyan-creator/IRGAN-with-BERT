FT  21 JUN 93 / International Company News: Tea and sympathy to company
bookworms / A look at an annual report which is more than justpackaging
ANNUAL reports may occasionally contain surprises, but few have contents
which leap out of the page at the reader like the latest offering from
BSO/Origin, the Dutch computer services company.
Those bored with the 1992 financial figures can make themselves a cup of
tea, cover their wounds or decorate a parcel with the help of the document.
The 130-page report, bound like a hardback book, includes a sticking plaster
from the US, a glistening star-shaped ribbon from India and a teabag from
England.
The objects are part of a thick section containing multi-lingual diaries and
photographs of BSO employees from around the world on October 27 last year -
a date chosen at random.
Mr Eckart Wintzen, president and chief executive, said: 'We think annual
reports are never read. People flick through them and ignore all the company
blurb as fluff.
'This may be fluff but it is fluff of a higher quality.'
Past editions of the annual report include one written on the company by an
anthropologist, and one designed for children aged 12, which had to be
reprinted to meet demand for about 35,000 copies.
As well as the financial information for the year to December 31, the report
also contains a detailed environmental statement which attempts to measure
the company's impact and how much it has spent to mitigate these effects.
The report is printed on chlorine-free paper.
