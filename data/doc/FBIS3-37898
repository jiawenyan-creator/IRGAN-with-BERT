  [Text] Moscow February 23 TASS -- The organisers of the 
armed opposition revolt last October in Moscow may be soon freed 
from the Lefortovo investigation prison, however they will spend 
this night in jail. 
  TASS learned from the Office of the Russian Prosecutor 
General on Wednesday that the decision of the State Duma to 
pardon the revolt organisers is an order for authorities as, 
according to the new Russian Constitution, the Duma is the 
supreme legislative body in issues of amnesty. 
  However, the Prosecutor's Office has not yet received the 
necessary documents from the Duma and cannot thus free the 
Lefortovo prisoners. 
  All activities will most evidently begin tommorrow, 
according 
to the Prosecutor's Office. 
  The pardoned organisers include former Vice-President 
Aleksandr Rutskoy, Former parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, 
diehard opposition members Ilya Konstantinov and Viktor Anpilov, 
as well as other resolute opponents of the Russian president. 
  The Prosecutor's Office said they know about the Duma 
decision thanks to radio broadcasts and some of them had 
meetings with lawyers and relatives on Wednesday.
