 

The Navajo Nation also proposed revisions to the Navajo Nation Rules implementing the AMLR Code of 1987 at (1) section
II, Part D, subsections 1 and 2, reclamation priorities; Part L, subsections 1 and 2, general reclamation requirements;
Part M, subsections 1 and 2, certification of completion of coal reclamation; Part N, subsection 1, eligible lands
and water subsequent to certification; Part O, subsection 1, exclusion of noncoal reclamation sites; Part P, subsections
1, 2, and 3, utilities and other facilities, and (2) section III, Part E, subsection 1, future reclamation set-aside
program. 

In addition, by letter dated May 4, 1994, the President of the Navajo Nation notified the Secretary of the Interior
that the Navajo Nation was certifying that it had completed all of its coal reclamation projects (administrative
record No. NA213) and stated that NAMLRD intends to complete all remaining priority 1 and 2 coal reclamation
projects, including interim coal reclamation projects, as required by section 403(a) of SMCRA. Reclamation projects
are funded under a priority schedule, such that ``priority 1'' projects concern those that involve the protection
of public health, safety, general welfare and property from extreme danger of the adverse effects of coal mining practices
while ``priority 2'' projects concern those that involve protection of public health, safety, and general welfare
from adverse effects of coal mining practices. The Navajo Nation submitted the request for the Secretary's concurrence
with certification of completion of all known coal-related problems with the intent that, if the Secretary concurred
with the certification, the Nation would request AMR funds to pursue projects under the provisions of section 411
of SMCRA. 

OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment and the Navajo Nation's request for the Secretary's concurrence
with its certification of completion of coal reclamation in the May 18, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 25852, administrative record No. NA214), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting and
public comment on the substantive adequacy of the Navajo Nation's proposed amendment and certification, and requested
information concerning any known or suspected unreclaimed lands and water resources on Navajo Nation lands that
would be eligible for expenditures from the AMR fund under the provisions of the Navajo Nation's reclamation program.
Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting, none was held. The public comment period ended on June 17, 1994.
