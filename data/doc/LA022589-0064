RAVELING PLANS TO START SENIORS IN HOME FINALE 
USC Coach George Raveling plans to start seniors Chris Moore, Rich Grande and 
Andy Olivarez in the Trojans' final home game of the season today at 3 p.m. 
against Washington. 
Alan Pollard, senior forward, probably won't play because he has a hip pointer. 
USC is 9-18 overall and 2-13 in the Pacific 10 Conference. Washington is 10-15 
and 6-10. 
The Huskies have lost five of their last six games, most recently to UCLA 
Thursday night, 101-78. 
"Washington is a strange team," Raveling said. "They're a lot like us. They've 
had some moments when they looked like they could be one of the best teams in 
the conference and they've had some games (in which) you're puzzled as to what 
the heck's going on with them." CHRIS BAKER
