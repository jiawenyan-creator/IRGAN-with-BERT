FT  22 MAY 93 / Nadir gains control in his move to regain control of Turkish
assets
MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive Cypriot businessman, has successfully intervened
in the Turkish courts to prevent the sale of Gunaydin, the Istanbul
newspaper, in his latest move to regain control of his Turkish assets.
On Thursday an Istanbul court postponed the sale by the official receivers
of Gunaydin, pending settlement of dispute over ownership of the newspaper's
title.
The former Polly Peck chairman, who jumped bail in the UK earlier this month
and fled to northern Cyprus, has said he will fight to regain his assets in
Turkey.
