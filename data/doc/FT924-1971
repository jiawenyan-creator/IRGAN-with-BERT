FT  15 DEC 92 / Construction Contracts: Business centre development in Kent
The CAPITA GROUP has won a five-year contract worth Pounds 15m from Kent
County Council, which will involve the operation of the Council's central
mainframes and corporate data network and will significantly reduce Kent's
spread on its central IT (information technology) services.
As part of the contract Capita will establish a new multi-purpose business
centre at the Kings Hill business park at West Malling near Maidstone, from
where a wide range of managed services will be provided.
In addition to the 50 central IT personnel from Kent being offered the
opportunity to transfer to the Capita payroll, over 150 jobs will be created
at the centre. The business centre will occupy some 25,000 sq ft and house a
wide range of hardware, software and computer-based services to meet the
needs of other interested customers.
