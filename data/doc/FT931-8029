FT  20 FEB 93 / US grand jury probes Eli Lilly over rules on drug
manufacture
A GRAND JURY is investigating Eli Lilly, the drugs company, in relation to
the company's compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory
requirements concerning its manufacturing operations, Alan Friedman reports
from New York.
A spokesman for the Indianapolis-based company said Eli Lilly had been
informed of a US government investigation that is being conducted by a
federal grand jury in Maryland.
The company said it believed the inquiry arose from a 1989 FDA review that
resulted in a voluntary agreement between Lilly and the FDA to strengthen
the company's manufacturing quality systems.
Mr Robert Williams, Lilly's vice-president for corporate quality and
environmental affairs, said in a prepared statement that the company had
complied with the terms of the 1989 agreement and claimed Lilly's
manufacturing quality systems were now 'among the best in the industry'. He
stressed that the government had not questioned the safety or efficacy of
any Lilly product in the marketplace. Lilly's share price declined yesterday
by Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 50 3/8 in the wake of the company's
announcement.
