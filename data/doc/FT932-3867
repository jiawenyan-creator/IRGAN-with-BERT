FT  11 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
GOLD closed below Dollars 370 a troy ounce on the London bullion market
after failing to break resistance on the upside at Dollars 372. Dealers said
the market was just looking for new direction. 'The market is so evenly
poised than any bit of information that comes out will tip it one way or the
other,' one said. Some chart analysts were predicting a further drop down to
Dollars 365 to fill a chart gap. But in the longer term most felt that,
although gold's uptrend had certainly lost momentum, the current period of
consolidation would not last too long. Base metals lost early gains under
the influence of a collapsing COPPER price on the London Metal Exchange, and
by the close most were trading in the minus column. 'Recent rises have been
purely based on technicals and are proving to be rather fragile,' one trader
said. Three-month copper rose early to Dollars 1,867 a tonne as short
covering was prompted by Wednesday's late rise on Comex. But there was no
follow-through in London, or when Comex opened yesterday, and this swiftly
undermined buyers' confidence. Liquidation took the price down to Dollars
1,840 at the close, up just Dollars 6 from Wednesday.
