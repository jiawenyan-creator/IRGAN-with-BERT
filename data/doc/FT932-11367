FT  05 MAY 93 / Mexican will defend libel suit
MEXICO'S former minister of communications and transport, Mr Andres Caso
Lombardo, says he has turned down an offer to become his country's
ambassador to the UK, to defend himself against accusations of libel brought
by British subject and former IBM agent Mr Kaveh Moussavi.
Mr Caso Lombardo, minister until March this year, said he would not take up
a position in the foreign service, so as to 'have absolutely all the freedom
to defend myself' against Mr Moussavi's accusations.
A writ against Mr Caso Lombardo for libel and slander was issued in London
on Friday on behalf of Mr Moussavi, who has engaged the services of libel
specialists Peter Carter-Ruck and Partners.
Mr Moussavi claims that Mr Caso Lombardo defamed him in giving his response
to allegations made by Mr Moussavi earlier this year.
Mr Moussavi had said three officials from the Mexican government had
solicited a bribe of Dollars 1m (Pounds 650,000) in return for fixing a
controversial Dollars 21m air traffic control contract.
Although the legality of the contract was later upheld by Mexico's
Comptroller of the Federation, Mr Moussavi's allegations created a storm in
Mexico.
Mexico's attorney-general, Mr Jorge Carpizo, said yesterday his office would
investigate Mr Moussavi's original allegations and the counter-charges
arising out of them.
