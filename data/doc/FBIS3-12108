  [Text] We read in a press release: Since one of the 
missions of the military institution is to protect the lives and 
property of all, Haitian nationals and foreigners alike, the 
General Headquarters of the Haitian Armed Forces warns all those 
who think they can, through their actions, create a climate of 
insecurity to unavowed ends. 
  Once again, the General Headquarters urges all the nation's 
sons to work so together we can maintain the atmosphere of peace 
and unity that all of us need to encourage the process of 
national reconciliation.
