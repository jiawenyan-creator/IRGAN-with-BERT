FT  03 JUL 92 / Fall in headhunting underlines recession
A SHARP fall in headhunting of senior managers in industry, shown up in
figures released yesterday, has added to fears of a stalled recovery.
According to a survey by InterExec, a recruitment consultancy, the number of
top industrial jobs for which headhunters were seeking candidates fell 12
per cent in the second quarter of this year compared with the same period
last year.
The study also indicates that overseas companies are boosting recruitment of
executives based in Britain, taking advantage of the slack jobs market.
The figures apply to jobs at director level with an average salary of Pounds
50,000. Efforts to fill such positions through 'executive search' methods
are considered a good indicator of companies' sales prospects.
Although the year-on-year change may have been distorted by the large
increase in recruitment in the second quarter of last year after the end of
the Gulf war, they will heighten anxiety that the upturn is running out of
steam. In the first quarter, vacancies showed a 14 per cent year-on-year
increase.
The survey is based on information collected from about 1,000 employers and
recruitment agencies. InterExec believes the study covers between a third
and a half of all vacancies being filled by non-advertising techniques.
The survey says that between April and June companies based in Britain were
trying to fill 1,307 vacancies by headhunting compared with 1,480 in the
corresponding period last year. Vacancies in the first half totalled 2,834,
0.7 per cent more than the 2,812 recorded in the first half of last year.
The number of overseas vacancies for which UK-based managers were being
sought climbed 40 per cent to 274 in the second quarter.
