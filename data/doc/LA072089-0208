SOUTHLAND; 
WOMAN WITH KNIFE ARRESTED AT NBC 
A Canadian woman with a knife in her backpack was arrested after allegedly 
loitering for three days outside the NBC-TV studio where "The Tonight Show With 
Johnny Carson" is taped, police said today. 
Krystyna Marenchin, 39, of Ontario, was arrested Wednesday for investigation of 
violating a municipal code section against loitering with a concealed weapon, 
Lt. Gordon Bowers said. "There's no indication that she was trying to get to it 
or use it," Bowers said of the knife. Officers found the souvenir-type weapon 
with an engraved, 11-inch blade and a fancy sword hilt when she allowed them to 
search her backpack.
