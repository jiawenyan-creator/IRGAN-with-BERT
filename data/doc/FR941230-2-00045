<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FGDC is sponsoring a public review of draft cadastral spatial data content and collection standards, and metadata
profile. Cadastral data are defined as the geographic extent of the past, current, and future rights and interests
in real property and the framework to support the description of that geographic extents. Also included are standards
for cadastral frameworks such as the Public Land Survey System. Metadata are data about the content, quality, and
condition of data.



The standards will aid the collection of cadastral data and the automation of land records. The standards define the
data and processes. Specific implementation details for particular technologies are not addressed.

Success of the standards will depend on consideration given to the needs and views of State and local governments,
industry, and the public. The purpose of this notice is to solicit such views. The FGDC invites the community to review,
test, and evaluate the draft standards. Comments are encouraged about the content, completeness, and usability
of the standard.

The FGDC anticipates that the final draft will be considered for adoption as a Federal Geographic Data Committee standard.
The standards may be forwarded to other standards organizations for adoption if interest warrants such actions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The standards were developed by the cadastral subcommittee of the FGDC under responsibilities assigned by Office
of Management and Budget Circular A16. In addition to Federal participation, the subcommittee held open forums
about the standards in several national, regional, and State conferences. Participation in these meetings included
persons from county government, data conversion businesses, and State and local agencies. An earlier draft of the
standards was provided for comment to approximately 500 organizations and persons who had expressed interest in
the standards.
