  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian 
president's special envoy, rejected the idea of using "the 
Sarajevo technique" elsewhere in Yugoslavia. 
  NATO officials have been calling on an increasing number of 
occasions for using the technique of an ultimatum followed by 
diplomatic activity in Tuzla and Mostar. 
  Churkin told NATO that a replay of the Sarajevo scenerio was 
out of the question. He believed that that which did not come 
off the first time, is also not going to lead to anything the 
second time. He did not think that air strikes could be 
effective in Mostar, where Bosnian Croatians and Moslems are 
engaged in fighting. "In any case, we do not support such 
operations," he emphasized. 
  He said that what was needed in Tuzla was opening the 
airport 
for humanitarian aid rather than lifting the siege. "Various 
options are possible but I do not think that the humanitarian 
situation in the town can be improved by shelling its environs," 
Churkin said. 
  Vitaliy Churkin stressed that energetic activities were 
being 
carried out in Tuzla. "The purpose is to open the airport under 
an agreement between the UN forces' leadership in former 
Yugoslavia and the two conflicting parties -- Serbs and Moslems. 
Both Serbian and Moslem parties put forward the demands which 
hamper the resolution of the issue on opening of the airport," 
he said. 
  "Russia keeps working with Serbs. However, we hope that 
somebody else will assume responsibility for negotiations with 
Moslems who currently control the airport. To open the airport 
it is necessary that the UN and Serb observers come there. This 
creates certain problems for the Moslem party," Churkin added.
