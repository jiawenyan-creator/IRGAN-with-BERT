FT  03 JUN 92 / 'Fugitive' Botnar wins court ruling
MR OCTAV Botnar, chairman and managing director of Nissan UK, was yesterday
described in the High Court in London as a 'fugitive from justice'.
Counsel for Mr Stan Cholaj, a former Nissan UK assistant managing director
who is claiming Pounds 1m damages for wrongful dismissal and breach of
contract, alleged that Mr Botnar 'attends trials wherever in the world it is
in his interests to do so'.
A warrant was issued by the Inland Revenue for the arrest of Mr Botnar in
January, when another present Nissan UK director and a former director were
also arrested. They were charged with corporation tax fraud. Mr Botnar was
on holiday at his Swiss home, and has not since returned to the UK.
Mr Michael Supperstone QC, counsel for Mr Cholaj, opposed the admission of
written evidence by Mr Botnar, and said he 'cannot stay in his sanctuary in
Switzerland as a fugitive from justice and put in his evidence at this
hearing'.
Mr Anthony Boswood QC, counsel for Nissan UK, presented a medical
certificate from a Swiss doctor claiming that Mr Botnar had a heart
condition.
He also read from an affidavit in which Mr Richard Fleck, a partner of
Herbert Smith, the City solicitors representing Nissan UK in its
investigation by the Revenue, stated that his firm had advised Mr Botnar not
to return to the UK until the Inland Revenue had indicated what charges it
planned against him.
Mr Supperstone said that since the first medical certificate had been
provided in February Mr Botnar 'has travelled the 6,000 miles to Japan and
back but not the short distance to the UK'.
Judge Laurie ruled that he would allow Mr Botnar's written evidence. The
hearing continues tomorrow.
