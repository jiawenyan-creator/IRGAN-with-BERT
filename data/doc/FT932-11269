FT  05 MAY 93 / Letter: Shareholder pressure on pay
Sir, Having read the letters in the FT on directors' 'over-the-top pay' it
is my opinion that until the full cost of a director is disclosed to
shareholders it may be impossible to address the issue in a proper manner.
After a decade of excess resulting from unreal salary payments supported by
stock options and bonus rewards together with pension contributions and
benefits it seems curious that UK shareholders do not more often group
together by size to activate change from the directors of companies in which
they have invested.
European 'shareholder activists' do not enjoy the exposure and success of
their crusading US counterparts but now is the time to intensify effort.
Perhaps if these programmes gathered momentum, those concerned would suffer
less.
