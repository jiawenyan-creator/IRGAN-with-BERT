FT  26 FEB 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Vintages to savour - Wine
Officially, Chateau Cheval-Blanc has only been a first-growth claret since
St Emilion was classified in 1955, but its international reputation was made
by the remarkable, exceptionally rich 1921, the 1934 (probably the finest
claret of the 1930s) and the 1947 which established its British reclame. Yet
its renown went back a good deal further; the bronze medal won at the
International Exhibition in London in 1867 is still reproduced on the label.
For nearly 150 years it has been owned by the Fourcaud-Laussac family, today
represented by the charming Madame de la Barre and her two sisters, while
the wine is made by Jean Lurton, of the Bordeaux wine family.
Whereas St Emilion is overwhelmingly Merlot grape country, the 36-hectare
Cheval-Blanc vineyard is 60 per cent Cabernet Franc. In part it shares the
specially gravelly soil of neighbouring Figeac, while adjoining La
Conseillante makes it a near-Pomerol.
Of the eight first-growths it can reasonably claim to be the most
consistent, though not the most expensive in the auction room.
During last year's vintage, I had a vertical tasting at the chateau of every
year from 1993 back to 1981 - with the exception of the recently bottled
1991. A few weeks later, older years were added to some of the same vintages
at a tasting at the restaurant Bibendum (113 Regent's Park Road, London NW1.
Tel: 071-722-5577). Where it still has some stock of a vintage, the price
per case is given. At the chateau, some of the wines tasted were in half
bottles; 1993 and 1992 were cask samples.
1993. As elsewhere, hopes of a very fine vintage were dashed by recurrent
rain. The vintage began on September 20 and finished on September 30. Early
loads of Chardonnay and Merlot were excellent, the quantity was good, the
selection severe and it is expected to be superior to the 1992.
1992. Recently racked and fined, leading to a loss of colour and a whiff of
sulphur. A bad time to taste. Started fairly fruity on the palate, but ended
a bit hard and short.
1990. Deep colour, rich, porty nose, long flavour with great concentration.
Should turn out a great wine (Pounds 550 in bond).
1989. Good, not deep colour, with slight brown edge; closed bouquet, lighter
than 1990. Supple elegant flavour - hard to taste after the 1990 and may
develop well (Pounds 525 in bond).
1988. More colour than 1989, showed more nose at Bibendum, plenty of depth
of flavour, but markedly tannic. A wine to keep which should turn out a
classic.
1987. Brownish colour, old claret nose and sweet flavour, very attractive
for current drinking.
1986. Good, but not yet remarkably deep in colour; very rich, concentrated
nose, which developed in glass. Deep flavours, some tannin. One of the best
of the decade.
1985. More colour now than the 1986, but less aroma; charming fairly light
wine that may well last longer than expected (Pounds 495 in bond).
1984. Very brown nose, rather like 1987 but less fruit; typical of the worst
year of the decade.
1983. Brown tint, elegant bouquet, sweet, agreeable flavour but not a lot
behind it. Easy drinking now, but unlikely to last a great time.
1982. Fine colour, rich, concentrated nose, complex flavour with fine
balance; sweet and long in the mouth. What one looks for in a fine
Cheval-Blanc (Pounds 1,050 in bond).
1981. Showing a little brown, with a little more colour than 1982,
well-developed bouquet, distinguished flavour, more forward than 1982 and
good current drinking (Pounds 495 in bond).
1979. Medium, very clear colour, elegant nose, more flavour and longer than
many 1979s, but ends a little dry.
1975. Quite brown, but less acid on nose and flavour than many 1975s and
agreeable drinking though a bit short. One of the finer wines of the year
(Pounds 595 duty paid).
1971. Very pale in colour, nice soft nose; easy drinking, typical of the
year.
1970. More colour, bigger nose and flavour than 1971. A fruitier, less lean
wine than many 1970s. Still some tannin, should keep. (Pounds 975 duty
paid).
My choice for the future would be 1986, if it can be found.
