 

B. Interpretation of the Policy: Presumptively Permitted Transactions



Former Rule 19c4 enumerated certain corporate actions that presumptively were not disenfranchising, but
nevertheless affected shareholder voting rights.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Actions presumptively permitted under former Rule 19c4 will continue to be presumptively permitted under
the Policy. In addition to these specific provisions of former Rule 19c4, in the release adopting Rule 19c4
the Commission specified that the rule would not apply in certain circumstances. As discussed below, these actions
also will be permitted under the Policy.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
These corporate actions include the following:

(1) Initial Public Offerings (``IPO'');

(2) Issuances of lower vote stock;

(3) Issuances of securities to effect a bona fide merger or acquisition with voting rights not greater than the per
share voting rights of any outstanding class of the common stock of the issuer; and

(4) Actions taken pursuant to state control share acquisition statutes.

</FOOTNOTE>


1. Initial Public Offerings



Under the Policy, companies can issue dual classes of stock with unequal voting rights in an initial public offering
and thereafter issue additional shares of those classes.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 In this regard, the issuance of disparate voting rights stock pursuant to an IPO is not a disenfranchising action because
there are no existing public shareholders that are being affected by the transaction. For example, a company could
offer Class 

A

, lower voting stock, and Class 

B

, higher voting stock, to the public in an initial public offering. Under the Policy, additional issuances of Class


B

, super voting stock, could be issued in the future because the dual class structure resulted from the IPO. The issuances
could be made without additional issuances of Class 

A

 stock. In contrast, if a company offers only Class 

A

 stock to the public in an initial public offering it could not subsequently issue a new Class 

B

 super voting stock.

The term ``initial public offering'' is intended to mean the offering of securities by a company by which it goes public.

</FOOTNOTE>


2. Lower Voting Stock



Under the Policy, a company that already has gone public may issue a new class of lower voting rights stock.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 Although former Rule 19c4 permitted new lower vote issuances, the Policy will provide an issuer with additional
flexibility to issue ``regular vote'' stock following the issuance of lower voting stock. Specifically, the Policy
will permit such issuances because shareholders purchasing a new issue of lower voting stock are fully aware of the
limits on their voting power, both individually and collectively, at the time of purchase. Similarly, existing shareholders
of lower voting stock are cognizant of the possibility that their voting power may decrease through subsequent issuances
of regular or lower voting stock. By restricting subsequent offerings to equal or lesser voting stock,
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 no existing individual or class of shareholder is disenfranchised by this form of capitalization. Thus, under the
Policy, an issuer may continue to issue new classes of lower voting stock (

e.g.

, stock with 1/2 vote per share followed by 1/4 vote per share, and so on).



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
Lower vote stock has voting rights less than the per share voting rights of any outstanding class of the common stock
of the issuer.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
As indicated earlier, a company with an existing structure composed in part of super voting stock, may continue to
issue additional shares of the super voting stock without being in violation of the Policy.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Policy, however, will clearly prohibit the issuance of a new class of stock with voting rights greater than the
outstanding existing classes. For example, a company with a one vote class and 1/2 vote class could not later issue
a new class of super voting stock with votes higher than the one vote class. There are certain limited situations, however,
where a company with multiple classes may be able to issue a new class of stock with voting rights higher than one of the
existing classes. For example, a company with classes of one vote and 1/4 vote stock outstanding may be able to issue
a new class with 1/2 vote stock even if it was not part of its original capital structure. The SROs should analyze such
issuances on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration the information disclosed to shareholders in the creation
of the existing outstanding classes, the purposes and economics of the issuance of the new class of stock, and the disenfranchising
effect on each outstanding class.

Notwithstanding the above, there are certain issuances of lower voting stock that would clearly violate the Policy
because they are constructed in a manner to disenfranchise shareholders. For example, if a company issued lower voting
stock with a divided sweetener in exchange for stock of an outstanding class with higher votes but lower dividends,
this exchange offering would be violative of the Policy. Thus, the SROs will review issuances of new classes of lower
voting stock to determine if they are consistent with the Policy.
