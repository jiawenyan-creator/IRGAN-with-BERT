FT  13 MAY 93 / US President Clinton proposes to create government trust
fund
President Bill Clinton proposed yesterday to create a government trust fund
for revenue from tax increases to make sure it is used only to cut the
federal budget deficit, Reuter reports from Washington. The move fends off
Republican critics of his budget proposals who claim the president will
increase taxes without dealing with the mounting deficit.
