  [Text] Registration at the Nacala-a-Velha's seven electoral 
registration centers is still suspended as a result of a 
decision made by the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] 
representative at the Provincial Elections Commission. This was 
confirmed to our correspondent by Aurelio das Neves, Nampula's 
commission chairman, at the end of a meeting held today to 
assess the situation. 
  Registration has not yet begun in localities of Malema 
District. Neves said it has not been possible to meet Renamo's 
advisers to the provincial governor to discuss the situation.
