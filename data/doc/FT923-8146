FT  13 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Queens Moat
Queens Moat's interim figures do little to correct the reputation for
profligate expansion which caused it to turn repeatedly to its shareholders
for rights issues during the 1980s. In contrast to Rank, which has imposed
firm discipline on its capital spending during the recession, net debt rose
by Pounds 65m to around Pounds 790m during the first half. This added 15 per
cent to Queens Moat's interest bill, in turn marring a 16 per cent rise in
operating profit.
In theory, the company should now be able to contain its borrowing. It has a
sufficient presence in Europe to allow further expansion to be achieved in
ways which generate rather than consume cash, such as leasing, management
contracts and franchising. Gearing is only 60 per cent, even on the
conservative basis with which Queens Moat values its assets. So there is no
immediate need for more capital. Just the same, the market needs convincing
of the company's self-discipline before putting the shares on a rating that
reflects its ability to rise out the recession.
