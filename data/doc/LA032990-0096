METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEACHER WHO QUIT OVER FILM WON'T BE 
REINSTATED 
The Pasadena Unified School District Board of Education this week refused to 
reinstate a seventh-grade science teacher despite pleas from the teacher and 
about 30 supporters. 
Peter Connolly, a teacher at Washington Middle School, resigned under pressure 
March 9 after a parent complained that Connolly had shown his students a nude 
scene from "The Meaning of Life," an R-rated movie by the British comedy group 
Monty Python. 
A replacement was hired that same day to fill the position for the rest of the 
year, said Vera Vignes, associate superintendent for personnel services. 
Connolly, who said he regrets showing the film clip, said he changed his mind 
about resigning last week because of overwhelming support from his students. He 
will meet with district Supt. Phil Linscomb Monday to discuss his options.
