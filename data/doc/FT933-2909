FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Germans to take 26.5% stake in Jones &amp;
Shipman
KORBER, a secretive German group best known for its Hauni cigarette
manufacturing machinery, is to take a 26.5 per cent stake in Jones &amp;
Shipman, the lossmaking maker of grinding and honing machines.
The deal, along with a placing and open offer of new shares, will raise
Pounds 2.96m for J&amp;S, and is crucial to the survival of one of the most
famous names in the UK machine tool industry.
J&amp;S said shareholders should be aware that if its proposals were not
implemented 'the group may have insufficient working capital facilities to
continue trading'.
The transaction with Korber, under discussion for the past 18 months, opens
the way for Leicester-based J&amp;S to announce its delayed results for the year
ended March 31.
The company reported a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.54m (Pounds 7.35m)
on turnover down from Pounds 15.9m to Pounds 13.4m for the year. Losses per
share were cut to 12.7p (56.1p). No dividend is recommended.
The share stake is intended to cement a co-operation agreement between J&amp;S
and Korber's two grinding machine companies, Blohm and Schaudt.
Mr John Wareing, Jones &amp; Shipman's managing director, said the deal would
help J&amp;S develop its business. Its new German partners will sell J&amp;S
machines in Germany, where the UK company's presence has always been weak.
J&amp;S in turn will sell Blohm machines in the UK, but not Schaudt machines for
contractual reasons.
The Pounds 1.63m from Korber is to be raised through the subscription by the
German group for 6.81m new shares at 24p each, a further Pounds 1.61m is to
be raised through the placing by Close Brothers of 6.7m new shares at the
same price.
The deal will allow J&amp;S to complete its restructuring programme, which is
based on contracting out most of its machining work.
