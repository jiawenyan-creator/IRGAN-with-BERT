The five-part documentary series about Spain and the New World, The Buried
Mirror, beginning on BBC2 (8.00) is written and presented by Mexican writer
Carlos Fuentes and directed by some of the best people in the business:
Michael Gill ('Civilisation' etc), Peter Newington ('Monitor' etc), and
Christopher Ralling ('The Voyage Of Charles Darwin' etc). In this opening
programme Fuentes looks at the mixture of people that created the Latin
Americans: Spaniards, Arabs, Jews, Indians and Negroes, ranging from Vera
Cruz to Altamira.
BBC2 starts a three-part dramatisation of the comic thriller Mr Wakefield's
Crusade, by Booker Prize winner Bernice Rubens. Wakefield is played by Peter
Capaldi and the cast also includes Richard Griffiths (9.40).
Sean's Show (10.00 C4) becomes ever more tortuous. Comedian Sean Hughes, who
is being kept in a studio replica of his Muswell Hill flat, wakes after an
embarrassing night out to discover a woman snoring in his bed. Is it Barry
the barman's wife? Or Aunt Florry? Sean tries to get her to watch a
documentary on badgers but instead she tunes in to Sean's Show . . .
