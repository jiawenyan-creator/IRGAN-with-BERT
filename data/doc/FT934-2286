Eight people were killed and 10 were wounded in a heavy mortar and artillery

isolated but deadly attacks on the besieged Bosnian capital, Reuter reports
from Sarajevo.
Doctors at Kosevo hospital, the main casualty centre, said five women and
three men were killed when two mortar rounds landed near the Drvenija bridge
and near the barracks of the Egyptian UN brigade. A Bosnian soldier was
killed by a sniper in the Vogosca district.
The latest fighting has forced UN peacekeepers to close the airport, which
is under their control. Fierce fighting was also reported in central Bosnia.
Moslem troops launched a heavy artillery and mortar attack on Croat
positions around Zepce.
