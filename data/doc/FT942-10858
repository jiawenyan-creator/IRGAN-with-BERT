FT  09 MAY 94 / Swedish party backs EU
Sweden's Centre party yesterday voted to support the country's application
to join the European Union, averting a potential crisis in the four-party
coalition government, writes Christopher Brown-Humes from Stockholm.
The vote enables the coalition to present a united front on the issue in the
run-up to September's general election and a national referendum on EU
membership on November 13. The Centre's backing for membership came followed
a two-day debate. The margin in favour was 184 votes to 92.
