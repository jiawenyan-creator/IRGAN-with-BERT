FT  15 MAY 92 / People: British Shoe shuffle
Sears, the lumbering retail giant which this month reported dismal annual
results, is making another determined attempt to shake up its troublesome
subsidiary, British Shoe Corporation, which accounts for about one in five
pairs of shoes sold in the UK.
The company says the initial cost-cutting and stabilisation is complete and
BSC is planning to introduce further commercial and operational improvements
to place the division on a 'sound footing for the future'. In order to
implement the second phase of rationalisation, Sears announced a string of
senior management appointments at BSC.
John Osborn, the managing director who pushed through the initial
restructuring phase, steps up to the post of deputy chairman. A successor as
md has not yet been named but in the meantime Stephen Smith has been brought
in as deputy managing director from the Freemans mail order business.
Jeff Nash, retail operations director at the successful Adams childrenswear
chain, will assume the same role at BSC. And John Wheeler, head of Sears
information systems, will be seconded to the BSC team to support the
development of its computer functions.
