  [Text] Riyadh, April 14 (AFP)--Saudi Arabia plans to buy 
submarines to protect its coastlines both along the Gulf and the 
Red Sea, the official news agency SPA reported Thursday. 
  Deputy Defence Minister 'Abd-al-Rahman Bin-'Abd-al-Aziz, 
quoted by SPA, told naval officers in al-Dammam on Wednesday 
that his country wanted submarines which could adapt to the Red 
Sea and the more shallow waters of the Gulf. 
  Prince 'Abd-al-Rahman did not disclose if negotiations had 
opened for buying the vessels. 
  Iran, across the oil-rich Gulf from the Saudi kingdom, 
bought 
three submarines from Russia in 1992, raising concern among its 
Arab neighbours and their Western allies which have a naval 
presence in the strategic waterway. 
  SPA also reported that the national guard on Wednesday wound 
up a week of exercises on the Gulf coast of eastern Saudi Arabia.
