  [Text] Beijing, January 27 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese side 
has seriously and conscientiously investigated the matter of a 
Chinese company selling contraband chemicals to a U.S. company, 
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin said here today. 
  When asked to confirm and comment that a Chinese company has 
sold contraband chemicals to the Middle East at the weekly news 
briefing, Wu said the initial result of investigations shows 
that at repeated requests by a U.S. company, the Chinese 
company, in violation of the relevant provisions of the Chinese 
Government, sold a certain amount of some kind of chemicals to 
it. 
  The Chinese side has informed the U.S. Government of the 
investigation results and demanded that the U.S. Government 
conduct necessary investigations of the U.S. company, he said. 
  According to what has been said by the U.S. side, Wu said, 
the U.S. Government is investigating the American company. 
  Therefore, said the spokesman, the question as to which 
place 
the U.S. company finally sold these goods should be referred to 
the U.S. side.
