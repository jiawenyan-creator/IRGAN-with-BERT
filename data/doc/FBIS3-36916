  [Text] We have just received a letter from the central 
committee of the Communications Workers' Union, signed by Mr. 
Nazeykin. It says: 
  The mass media are distorting the facts regarding 
implementation of the demands by the work forces at 
communications enterprises serving in the Russian information 
sphere--namely, by saying that communication workers are 
demanding trillions of rubles and that the Union's central 
committee has allegedly agreed to the government's decision. 
  The central committee of the Communication Workers' Union 
has 
protested to [Oleg] Poptsov, chairman of the All-Russian 
Television and Radio Company, on this issue and has demanded 
live air time to explain the situation. Despite demands by work 
forces for talks with the government, the latter has not deemed 
it necessary to meet either the Union's central committee or the 
coordinating committee. Since they have no received no specific 
realistic decision from the government, the coordinating 
committee and the Union's central committee are insisting again 
on talks with the government.
