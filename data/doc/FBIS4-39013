  [Text] The Russian Defense Ministry proposed a new military 
mobilizing concept for industry aimed at a sharp reduction of 
the reserve capacities in order to mobilize them during an 
emergency period. First Deputy Russian Defense Minister Andrey 
Kokoshin told Interfax today that this was due to the altered 
evaluation of the character of any potential war or armed 
conflict and of the present economic realities when it was 
necessary to pay for everything. 
  Kokoshin added that the Russian Defense Ministry was in 
favor 
of producing jets, helicopters, satellite and other supervising 
systems at military-industrial enterprises. He said if the 
defense industry enterprises started to make civil products, 
this would help to preserve the scientific and technical 
potential of these enterprises. Such enterprises will be the 
main resources of the country in a period of emergency. 
  Kokoshin stressed that officers of the Defense Ministry and 
other departments were not unanimous in their assessment of the 
new concept. The State Committee on the Defense Industry and 
the Economic Ministry are also arguing on the issue.
