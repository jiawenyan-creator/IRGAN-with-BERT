  [Text] Widespread losses were reported on the 28 June 
currency market in Treasury Bonds and on the New York Stock 
Exchange due to the relentless drop in the dollar. Despite the 
opinion of economists that the crisis has yet to reach bottom, 
the value of the dollar on the New York market was under the 
psychological barrier of 100 yen, one of its lowest levels since 
the end of World War II, the result of one of the most serious 
crises in Japanese politics. 
  Specialists believe that the problems in Japan and the 
recovery of the German economy are the main causes for this 
continual drop in the dollar, placing Bill Clinton's 
administration in an embarrassing situation. 
  EFE comments that in spite of the drop in the dollar's value 
in recent years, the commercial trade deficit with Japan has 
continued to increase. In addition, it is believed that the 
dollar's decline deters foreign investments on the New York 
Stock Market and casts doubt on the economic recovery on which 
President Clinton prides himself.
