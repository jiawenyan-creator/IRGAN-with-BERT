  [Text] Wildbad Kreuth (DPA) -- For the first time, the 
president of the Federal Constitutional Court, Roman Herzog, has 
publicly declared his willingness to stand as a candidate for 
the office of president. Herzog said today, at the closed 
meeting of the CSU [Christian Social Union], that he was a 
candidate like the others. Herzog apparently intends to announce 
his candidacy at the assembly on 23 May even without the 
agreement of the FDP [Free Democratic Party]: "I do not claim 
to be a de luxe candidate." 
  Prior to the meeting, the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] 
and CSU leaders, Helmut Kohl and Theo Waigel, had agreed on 
Herzog as the successor to Richard von Weizsaecker. Finance 
Minister Waigel said after a telephone conversation with Kohl at 
the start of the Land CSU closed meeting: "It is clear who the 
CDU/CSU nominee will be." 
  Waigel called on the FDP to withdraw their candidate, 
Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher. Herzog would have to be nominated by 
the coalition. With his independence, poise, and political 
experience, the Federal Constitutional Court judge was best 
qualified: "There could be no better candidate."
