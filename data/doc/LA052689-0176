MAN SLAIN IN SANTA ANA IDENTIFIED 
A man shot dead by a Santa Ana motorcycle officer as he tried to escape arrest 
Thursday was identified by a police spokesman this morning as Paul Castro, 20, 
of Santa Ana, who was being sought by police as a suspect in at least two armed 
robberies. 
The spokesman said police "had been looking for him pretty heavily" for at 
least two weeks when officers received a tip that Castro was at an address in 
the 2000 block of W. Civic Center Drive. The spokesman said four uniformed 
officers were sent to the address, and when Castro saw them pull up, he began 
to run and reach to his waist. One officer fired twice, hitting him once in the 
back, police said.
