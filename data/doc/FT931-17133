FT  02 JAN 93 / Israel passes jobs budget
ISRAEL'S parliament yesterday approved the 1993 state budget, the first
under Labour Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, after a marathon all-night
session, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. The vote was 44-36.
The Shk102bn (Pounds 24.3bn) budget aims to ease 11 per cent unemployment by
creating 90,000 jobs, mainly through infrastructure and business incentive
allocations totalling Shk6.4bn.
Inflation was forecast to remain steady at 10 per cent.
The government abolished a Shk250 travel tax, a 4 per cent fee on foreign
currency purchases, and customs duty on products from the European Free
Trade Association countries. It reduced value added tax from 18 to 17 per
cent and company taxes from 40 to 39 per cent.
Defence, at Shk18.2bn, is the largest item in the operating budget. In the
overall budget, debt repayment takes the largest allocation, at 29 per cent,
followed by 26 per cent for welfare and transfer payments. Defence accounts
for 18 per cent of the overall budget.
The deficit, which by law must be wiped out by 1995, is projected at 3.2 per
cent of gross domestic product in 1993, compared to the 1992 projection of
6.2 per cent. GDP, up 6.4 per cent in 1992, is predicted to increase by 3.5
per cent in 1993.
