HIGHER PREMIUMS FOR WOOD ROOFS 
Regarding renewed discussions about wood roofs "Fires Fan Wood-Roof Debate" 
(Aug. 5): 
I'm from West Texas, where there is nothing to burn in wildfires; however, the 
type of roof is taken care of there, fairly and equitably, by the fire 
insurance companies. 
Those wanting wood roofs must pay higher premiums, sometimes prohibitively 
high. 
Why wouldn't this work in California? Consider the burden lifted from city and 
county officials who must deal with special wood interests. It also appears 
that in California persons with fire-resistant roofs are forced to subsidize 
the wood-roof owners by paying higher premiums.
