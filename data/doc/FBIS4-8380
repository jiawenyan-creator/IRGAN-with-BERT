  [Text] The NATO air strikes against Serb positions are the 
best response the world can give to justice and peace in the 
former Yugoslavia, as well as providing the best hope for a 
long-term solution to the crisis, a communique by the government 
of the republic of Kosova states concerning the NATO attacks. 
  The communique further states that experience has shown that 
only by destructing Serb military machinery will the aggression 
be prevented from sacrificing neighboring peoples and 
accomplishing their ambitions for Greater Serbia, because only 
in this way can equalibrium be attained in the Balkans and ways 
for an unconditional dialogue among the peoples in the region 
created. 
  On this occasion, the government of the republic of Kosova 
reiterates its appeal to the United Nations and NATO to 
undertake indispensable preventive steps in Kosova, including 
its demilitarization and the placement of international forces 
there. The communique is signed by Prime Minister Dr. Bujar 
Bukoshi.
