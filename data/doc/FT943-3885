FT  12 SEP 94 / Observer: Nugatory
Ever wondered what happened to all those sociolinguists that academic
establishments seemed to be cloning by the dozen during the 1970s? Well,
some have found gainful employment.
It was to Semiotic Solutions, for instance, that British Telecom turned for
some help during its campaign to persuade the male of the species to dally
longer on the telephone.
Now the self-same experts in the meaning of signs and symbols have been
asked to judge how Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's will go down in
India.
McDonald's, the boffins concluded, will be the 'friendly alien tapping into
the outer directed culture and self, appealing to the emergent younger
generation cohorts, and being a badge or marker of lifestyle'.
Kentucky Fried Chicken, a trifle more prosaically, will 'penetrate the home
and family with new, more efficient ways of doing traditional things'.
Which apparently translates into the prediction that chicken nuggets will
outsell cheeseburgers on the streets of Bombay.
