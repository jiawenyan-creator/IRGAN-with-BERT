 

(2) Prior to the accumulation of 1,500 flight hours since manufacture, or within 30 days after November 24, 1992 (the
effective date of AD 922403), whichever occurs later, perform a check of the grounding wire for the thrust
reverser directional control valve (DCV) in accordance with Section III, paragraph B., of Boeing Service Bulletin
767780046, Revision 1, dated September 17, 1992. Thereafter, repeat this check at the times specified
in paragraph (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) of this AD. 

(i) At intervals not to exceed 1,500 flight hours; and 

(ii) Whenever maintenance action is taken that could disturb the DCV grounding circuit. 

(d) If any of the inspections, tests, adjustments, and/or functional checks required by paragraph (c) of this AD cannot
be performed successfully as specified in the service bulletin, prior to further flight, deactivate the associated
thrust reverser in accordance with Section 78311 of Boeing Document D630T002, ``Boeing 767 Dispatch
Deviation Guide,'' Revision 9, dated May 1, 1991. The thrust reverser shall remain deactivated until all inspections,
tests, adjustments, and functional tests required by paragraph (c) of this AD are completed successfully. 

(e) Within 3 years after the effective date of this AD, install an additional thrust reverser system locking feature
(sync-lock) in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767780062, Revision 2, dated June 3, 1993,
or Revision 3, dated February 24, 1994. Installation of this additional locking feature constitutes terminating
action for the requirements of paragraph (c) of this AD. 

(f) Within 4,000 hours time-in-service after accomplishing the modification required by paragraph (e) of this AD,
or within 4,000 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later; and thereafter
at intervals not to exceed 4,000 hours time-in-service: Perform the integrity test of the thrust reverser synchronous
shaft locks specified below to detect latent failures of the components and to ensure the integrity of the thrust reverser
system. Prior to further flight, repair any discrepancy found in accordance with procedures described in the Boeing
767 Maintenance Manual. 



THRUST REVERSER SYNC-LOCK_ADJUSTMENT/TEST 



1. 

General 



A. There are two sync-locks for each engine thrust reverser. The sync-lock is installed on the lower non-locking hydraulic
actuator of each thrust reverser sleeve. 

B. The Thrust Reverser Sync-Lock Integrity Test has two tasks: 
(1) The first task tests the electrical circuit which controls the operation of the sync-lock on each thrust reverser
sleeve. 
(2) The second task tests the mechanical function of the sync-lock on each thrust reverser sleeve. 
C. The thrust reverser sync-lock is referred to as the sync-lock in this procedure. 


2. Thrust Reverser Sync-Lock Integrity Test 


A. Equipment 
(1) Multi-meter, Simpson 260 or equivalent_commerically available. 
B. Prepare to do the Integrity Test for the sync-locks. 
(1) Supply electrical power. 
(2) For the left engine, make sure these circuit breakers on the overhead circuit breaker panel, P11, are closed: 
(a) L ENG T/R CONT 
(b) L ENG T/R IND 
(c) L ENG T/R SSL CONT 
(3) For the right engine, make sure these circuit breakers on the overhead circuit breaker panel, P11, are closed:

(a) R ENG T/R CONT 
(b) R ENG T/R IND 
(c) R ENG T/R SSL CONT 
(d) FOR ETOPS AIRPLANES, CLOSE THESE ADDITIONAL CIRCUIT BREAKERS: 
1) R ENG T/R CONT ALTN 
2) R ENG T/R IND ALTN 
(4) Open the fan cowl panels. 
C. Do the Electrical Integrity Test for the sync-locks. 
(1) Do these steps to make sure there are no ``hot'' short circuits in the electrical system that may accidentally supply
power to the sync-locks: 
(a) Remove the electrical connector, D20194, from the sync-locks, V170, on the left sleeve of the thrust reverser.

(b) Remove the electrical connector, D20196, from the sync-lock, V171, on the right sleeve of the thrust reverser.

(c) Use a multi-meter on the plug end of the applicable electrical connector to make sure that these conditions are
correct:

(d) If you did not find these conditions to be correct, you must do these steps: 

(1) Make a careful visual inspection of all the electrical wires and connectors between the sync-lock and its power
circuit breaker. 

(2) Repair all the unserviceable electrical wire and connectors that you find. 

(3) Use the multi-meter again to make sure there are no ``hot'' short circuits in the electrical system that can accidentally
supply power to the sync-locks. 

(e) If you find the correct conditions, do the Mechanical Integrity Test for the sync-locks.
