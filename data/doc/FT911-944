FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: Cedel to cut number of board
members
CEDEL, the international clearing house owned by more than 100 financial
institutions, plans to reduce the number of directors on its board from 41
to 13, writes Simon London.
The aim is to make Cedel easier to manage. Three liaison groups will be set
up, including a user advisory group to represent Cedel's 2,673 customers.
The day-to-day management will remain in the hands of Mr Andre Lussi, the
chief executive, and a full-time management board. The proposals will be
voted on at a special shareholders' meeting in September.
