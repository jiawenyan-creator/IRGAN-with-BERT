FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Offshore funds may prove a temptation - Unit
trusts
The chancellor proposed changes to the tax rules that apply to authorised
unit trusts, saying that his intention is to put investors who receive
interest indirectly through such a trust in the same tax position as if they
received the interest directly.
However, the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds argued that the
proposed measures would place onshore bond and money market funds at a
disadvantage vis a vis offshore funds. The proposals could also encourage
investors to invest directly in overseas equities rather than through pooled
investment vehicles, the Association said.
In future, the rate of corporation tax paid by authorised unit trusts will
be the same as the basic rate of income tax. This reverses changes made in
the Finance Act 1993 whereby it was planned to lower corporation tax from 25
per cent to 22.5 per cent in 1993-94 and then to 20 per cent.
Mr Philip Warland, director-general of the association, said the proposal to
raise corporation tax to 25 per cent 'produces a situation where bond funds
offshore (which sell their products to UK investors) are at a tax advantage
because the investors are only taxed at 20 per cent'. He warned that this
might drive more bond funds offshore. Foreign investors, however, will be
able to receive interest from UK funds gross.
Mr Warland said investors investing directly in overseas shares will be
taxed at 20 per cent, compared to 25 per cent if they buy through a unit
trust.
