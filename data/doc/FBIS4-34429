  [Text] Mexico City, 17 Jun (EFE) -- Today, President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari tasked Hector Hernandez Llamas with complying 
with the commitments the government made during the peace 
process in Chiapas, in the country's southeastern region. 
  A government source told EFE that Hernandez Llamas "will not 
be the new commissioner for peace and reconciliation," a post 
held by Manuel Camacho Solis, the former Mexico City mayor and 
foreign relations secretary, until 16 June. 
  "It is a different post. We could say Commissioner Camacho 
Solis already did his job. He concluded it, and we are now 
entering a new institutional phase, which is to monitor and 
follow up on the commitments," the source said. 
  This source, who declined to be identified, reiterated to 
EFE 
the Mexican Government does not plan to resume the hostilities 
in Chiapas "under any circumstances" and "does not want to give 
the Zapatist rebels a pretext to do so." 
  "What is next is to comply with the commitments the 
government made during the dialogue in San Cristobal de las 
Casas, during which Camacho Solis offered solutions to the 
demands of the Zapatists, and the government will carefully and 
strictly comply with the commitments," the source added.
