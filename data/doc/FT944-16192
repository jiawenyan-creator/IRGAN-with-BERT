FT  14 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Price for optimism
Financial markets round the world took a remarkably sanguine view of
yesterday's US producer price figures. The September headline fall of 0.5
per cent certainly looks good, but as a guide to sentiment the figures have
a shelf life of just one day. Today the markets must digest data on consumer
prices, capacity utilisation and retail sales. Besides, the producer price
figures were distorted by sharp falls in the prices of both petrol and cars,
the latter probably reflecting efforts by manufacturers to shed stocks of
1994 models. The underlying trend for intermediate goods and raw materials
suggests some inflationary pressure in the pipeline. With capacity use
around 85 per cent, companies may be tempted to pass higher prices on.
There is thus no compelling reason to revise expectations that the Federal
Reserve will decide to tighten at least once more. If so, yesterday's rally
could prove short-lived. But much depends on the extent of the Fed's
eventual action and how convinced markets are that the tightening process
has come to an end. Given its performance over the last week - the long bond
yield has fallen back by about 20 basis points - the bond market appears in
the mood to look for a turning point.
Yields of around 8 per cent look good value to long-term investors, even if
there is a risk of short-term setbacks. Bonds would become exceptionally
attractive once inflation has been definitively capped, so at some point
bond prices will rally rather than fall on news of a rise in short rates.
The outlook for equities is different: valuations are stretched with the
yield ratio to bonds at around 2.8 times. That looks uncomfortable when
policy aims to slow the economy down.
