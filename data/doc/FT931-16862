FT  04 JAN 93 / Nigerian LNG setback
NIGERIA'S plan to build a Dollars 4.3bn (Pounds 2.82bn) liquefied natural
gas (LNG) export plant has been put at risk after failure to win cash
support before a deadline for awarding the main contract, Reuter reports
from Lagos.
The inability to attract foreign investment totalling about Dollars 2bn by
December 22 means that construction bids by two international consortiums
are likely to be revised upwards.
A senior operator involved in the project said it would 'take a minor
miracle to keep it going. I believe the government might want to stop it, at
least for now.'
Policy shifts and bickering over which foreign companies should win the
construction contract threaten to deprive Nigeria of a big revenue earner.
