Applicants' Representations



1. The Company is an open-end management investment company registered under the Act and organized as a Maryland corporation.
The Company's existing and future series are referred to as the ``Funds.'' The Adviser provides investment advisory
and administrative services to each of the Funds.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The Underwriter acts as a principal underwriter of the Funds' shares. Each of the Funds has a single class of shares
that is currently offered to investors at net asset value without a sales load.



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
In the case of Aetna International Growth Fund, the Adviser has entered into a subadvisory arrangement with the Underwriter.
Applicants contemplate that certain of the five new series of the Funds may enter into sub-advisory arrangements
with advisory entities affiliated with the Adviser.

</FOOTNOTE>


A. Multi Class System



1. Applicants request relief, on behalf of themselves, any entity controlling, under common control with or controlled
by the Underwriter or the Adviser that may in the future serve as a Fund's underwriter or investment adviser, and any
registered investment companies that may in the future be advised or distributed by the Adviser or Underwriter. Applicants
propose to establish a multiple class distribution system to enable each of the Funds to offer investors the option
of purchasing classes of shares that would either be subject to: (a) A conventional front-end sales load, (b) a non-rule
12b1 service fee, (c) a rule 12b1 distribution fee, (d) a CDSC, (e) a combination of front-end sales load,
service fee, distribution fee and/or CDSC, or (f) no sales charge. Applicants currently contemplate offering only
two classes of shares.

2. Under the proposed multi-class distribution system, the Funds would continue to offer the current shares as ``Class
A shares.'' Class A shares would be distributed with no sales charge, distribution fee, or service fee to: (i) Certain
corporate retirement plans as determined by the board of directors, (ii) salaried employees and persons retired
from salaried positions with the Adviser and its affiliates, (iii) insurance companies (including separate accounts),
registered investment companies, investment advisers and broker-dealers acting for their own account and other
institutions as determined by the board of directors, (iv) current shareholders at the time of first offering of Class
B shares as long as they maintain a shareholder account (

i.e. 

current shareholders would be eligible to make future purchases of Class A shares upon the commencement of the Multi-Class
Distribution System); and (v) any other persons, organization, or affinity groups identified by the board of directors,
eligible to acquire shares, pursuant to which the sale of shares involves minimal sales expense to the Company.
