Information Service Department director under the Government 
Information Office and a member of the government's task force 
for dealing with airplane hijackings, by unidentified reporter 
at Chiang Kai-shek Airport; from the "News" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Director Chung, how are you? 
  [Chung] How are you? 
  [Reporter] Would you please provide us the latest 
information on the hijacking? 
  [Chung] To my knowledge, the airplane took off from Changsha 
at 0928 [0128 GMT], was hijacked over Nanping in Fuchou at 1005, 
and landed at Chiang Kai-shek Airport in Taoyuan at 1043. It 
was towed to a standby parking apron. The hijacker (Lin 
Wen-chiang) deplaned at 1055. This is the general picture of 
the hijacking. 
  [Reporter] Director Chung, have the passengers left the 
airplane? 
  [Chung] The passengers have not deplaned, but the hijacker 
has. 
  [Reporter] Are there any differences between this hijacking 
and previous ones? 
  [Chung] There are no differences. 
  [Reporter] Has Communist China taken any measures after our 
aviation control units found out about the hijacking? 
  [Chung] Not yet. Its past practice was to send an official 
message inquring about the general situation. However, it has 
not done so this time. 
  [Reporter] Have we sent personnel on board to conduct a 
safety inspection and carry out other measures? 
  [Chung] Deputy Director (Pan) of the Airport Police Bureau's 
Criminal Police Squad boarded the plane at 1052 to conduct 
negotiations and later led the hijacker off the plane. 
  [Reporter] Director Chung, would you please give us more 
information on the hijacker's identity and motive? 
  [Chung] According to our investigation at the airport, the 
hijacker (Lin Wen-chiang) was born on 8 June 1958. He donned a 
military uniform to pose as an armed police officer to carry out 
the hijacking. His family has five members, including himself, 
his foster mother, wife, and two children aged 7 and 9, 
respectively. By his own account, he hijacked the airplane 
because he was given a hard time by the local government when he 
applied for permission to set up a company in Changsha where he 
had been doing business. He decided to leave Communist China 
because he found its authorities corrupt. 
  [Reporter] Did the hijacker incur resistance or was anybody 
injured during the hijacking? 
  [Chung] This is still under investigation. We are waiting 
for officials from the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office to 
conduct an interrogation.
