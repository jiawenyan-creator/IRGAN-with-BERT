FT  26 OCT 93 / Yeltsin to open way for sale of land
THE Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, was expected last night to sign a
long-awaited decree allowing for the free sale and purchase of land - seven
decades after the Bolsheviks abolished private property and farming.
Despite numerous decrees and laws proclaiming the right to private land
ownership, introduced over the past two years, the Russian parliament had
inserted into the old constitution a moratorium of 10 to 15 years on the
right to resell land distributed to citizens by the state.
The decree will also lay the foundations for a mortgage system, enabling
banks to lend money to farmers. The state had previously given state and
collective farms, as well as fledgling private farmers, 'credits' which were
rarely returned. But commercial banks had steered clear of lending from the
own funds without collateral, and lending will remain difficult when
inflation is more than 1,000 per cent a year. Nonetheless, Russia already
has several thousand private farmers, who cannot sell their land freely.
Most of its urban dwellers already own small plots of land to build dachas
and grow vegetables, even though there is no well established market for
buying and selling land.
Although details of the decree were not yet clear, partly because senior
officials have been arguing over the final version, Izvestia newspaper
yesterday criticised a draft made available to it as giving too many rights
to collective and state farms. Part of the problem with agricultural reform
so far has been the absence of a mechanism to implement previous orders that
state and collective farms give land away to employees who want it.
The decree was also expected to lift limits on rent which can be charged for
land.
The main fear of opponents to a free land market was that foreigners and
other rich individuals would buy up the country on the cheap.
