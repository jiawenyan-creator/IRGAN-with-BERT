12% TO 15% INSURANCE PROFITS OK, NADER SAYS 
To the surprise and cheer of insurance industry representatives, consumer 
advocate Ralph Nader said Sunday that under the terms of Proposition 103, as 
rewritten by the California Supreme Court, companies might be entitled to a 12% 
to 15% annual profit. 
Under May's high court decision, Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie is 
supposed to assure that the companies receive a "fair and reasonable rate of 
return" when she decides on exemptions from Proposition 103-mandated rollbacks 
and approves proposed new rates submitted by the companies. 
Examination of Books Urged 
Nader cautioned that, before the bottom line is calculated, there has to be 
careful examination of each company's books by Gillespie to determine whether 
it is holding excess money in reserve and whether its stated costs are 
reasonable. But his endorsement of the 12% to 15% profit heartened insurers 
attending the annual convention of the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers 
of California and appeared to cause some discomfort to Proposition 103 author 
Harvey Rosenfield. 
Nader, Rosenfield and a number of insurance industry representatives were 
appearing in a lengthy debate that marked the opening session of the convention 
at the Hotel del Coronado. 
Much of what was said had been heard many times before, but Nader's use of 
specific figures to describe a permissible insurance company profit went beyond 
what even Gillespie has been willing to do. She has steadfastly avoided citing 
any numbers as a reasonable profit. 
At a news conference that followed the debate, Robert Vagley, president of the 
American Insurance Assn., said that 12% to 15% would be "a far more generous 
rate of return than the industry has seen in California" and that if Gillespie 
should adhere to such a standard, "it would put upward pressure on rates." 
Rosenfield, asked if he agreed with Nader, said, "I think it's a mistake to 
focus on a number." In setting rates of return, he said, regulators should 
distinguish between efficient insurance companies and the "typical slothful, 
wasteful" ones. 
It was one of the few times in the long, contentious debate over insurance 
issues in California that Rosenfield had taken even mild exception to anything 
Nader has said. 
Responding to Vagley's prediction of upward pressure on rates, Nader said he is 
convinced that the recent insurance price spiral in California will come to an 
end even under Gillespie, whom he has criticized as too pro-industry and urged 
to resign. 
When rate regulation begins, Nader said, "there's no way rates are going to be 
as high as they would have been without regulation." 
Industry representatives, however, suggested that the costs of regulation by 
themselves may contribute to higher prices. 
Nader Paid $10,000 
Jerry O'Kane, executive director of the agents and brokers association, said 
Nader was paid $10,000 to appear at the convention while Rosenfield and J. 
Robert Hunter, president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization, were 
each paid $2,500. Four industry representatives in the debate appeared without 
charge, he said. 
In welcoming remarks to the 1,550 delegates, Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), who 
plans to be a candidate for governor next year, said a New York-style no-fault 
insurance plan "is something that might be looked at in California." 
Under the New York system, lawsuits are sharply curtailed, motorists collect 
most of their losses from their own insurance companies and there is strict 
rate regulation. Benefits are quite generous, but the plan has succeeded for 
the most part in keeping price increases down in New York. 
Wilson said that, as a lawyer, he believes "the legal profession is very costly 
to the consumers of this nation" and cutting their role in the system would 
save everyone money. 
Later, Tom Conneely, president of the Assn. of California Insurance Companies, 
said most estimates are that installation of a New York-style no-fault in 
California would result in only a 0% to 4% immediate decrease in prices. Its 
main advantage, he said, would be to stem future price increases.
