  [Text] The leader president has received cables from the 
Religious Awareness Committees [Lijan al-Taw'iyah al-Diniyah] in 
al-Ta'mim, al-Anbar, and Babil Governorates in which they 
evaluated his excellency's decision to cancel horse racing and 
gambling and to build the Grand State Mosque instead. 
  The committees affirmed that this blessed step reinforces 
the 
progress of the faith campaign [al-hamlah al-imaniyah] which is 
lived by our steadfast, struggler people under the flag of 
Allahu Akbar, which is carried by the symbol and pride of Iraq, 
struggler leader President Saddam Husayn. 
  The members of the Religious Awareness Committees prayed to 
Almight God to preserve struggler leader President Saddam Husayn 
as an asset for Iraq and the Arab nation.
