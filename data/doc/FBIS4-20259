  [Text] Vatican City, April 29 (AFP) -- Pope John Paul II 
will be operated on Friday [29 April] after breaking his right 
thighbone in a fall, a specialist treating the 73-year-old 
pontiff said. 
  The operation will take place "in about an hour," said 
Doctor 
Corrado Manni, top anaesthesiologist at Rome's Catholic 
Unversity. 
  The pope was rushed to hospital early Friday in Rome's 
Gemelli clinic. 
  Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the pope broke the 
tip 
of his femur bone when he "fell accidentally in the bathroom in 
his apartment" around 11 p.m. (2100 GMT) Thursday night. 
  The pope was to have begun a visit to Sicily later Friday.
