Jim Kelly, Buffalo Bills' quarterback, has no intention of offering a 
settlement to a woman who claims he threw a beer-filled balloon at her, 
allegedly resulting in a mouth injury, Kelly's attorney said. 
Marlene Edbauer, 40, of Clarence, N.Y., is seeking $200,000 in damages from 
Kelly, who signed a $20-million contract last month that made him the highest 
paid football player. 
Edbauer testified in Buffalo city court that Kelly threw several balloons at 
her while they were both attending a picnic in suburban Tonawanda, N.Y., in 
1987, and that one of them hit her while she was drinking from a plastic cup, 
injuring her mouth.
