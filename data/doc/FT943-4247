FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Ascom recovers in first six
months
Ascom, the Swiss tele-communications equipment group, returned to profit in
the first half of 1994 after two years of losses and business and management
upheavals.
The group reported a pre-tax profit of SFr21m (USDollars 16m) in the six
months to June 30 compared with a loss of SFr79m in the same period last
year.
At the operating level, the group showed a profit of SFr3m compared with a
SFr68m loss.
Ascom attributed the turnround to cost cutting, concentration on core
businesses and extraordinary gains on disposals, and was hopeful of making a
profit in the full year. 'We won't make a loss and I hope we can make a
positive net profit,' said Mr Fred Sutter, chief executive.
The telecommunications equipment division doubled its operating income to
SFr33m on sales up 12 per cent to SFr751m. Ascom is a leader in the
fast-growing cordless telephone business.
The service automation division also doubled its operating profit to SFr28m
on flat sales of SFr436m. The division supplies coin and card phones and
ticket vending machines.
However, the US-based enterprise networks division continued to disappoint,
with a loss of SFr8m on sales down 2 per cent to SFr209m. Mr Felix Wittlin,
the new chairman, said he was convinced that the business of Ascom Timeplex,
acquired three years ago, was sustainable, but research projects were costly
and risky.
