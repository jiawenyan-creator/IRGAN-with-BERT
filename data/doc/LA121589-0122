BRIEFLY 
One-Year T-Bill Rates Fall: Interest rates on 52-week Treasury bills fell to 
the lowest level since June, 1988. The Treasury sold $9.75 billion of new bills 
at an average discount rate of 7.14%, down from 7.17% at the last auction Nov. 
16. The rates were the lowest since June 30, 1988, when the one-year bills sold 
for 7.04%. The new discount rate understates the actual return to investors -- 
7.66%, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,278.10.
