Corruption"] 
  [Text] Investigators have been given sweeping new powers 
to check officials suspected of corruption, it was revealed at 
the weekend. 
  They include freezing suspects' accounts and allowing taping 
or video interviewing with the alleged offenders. 
  Eight new measures were announced by the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission, the Party's main inspection body. 
  The commission expects to use the rules to help clean up the 
Party and guide China's campaign against corruption. 
  The measures, contained in its revised working rule, go into 
effect from May 1. 
  Inspectors can now look up and photocopy documents, account 
books, bill and records of meetings related to each case. 
  The books, bills, paperwork goods and cash can also be 
seized, subject to the approval of county level discipline 
chiefs. Investigators will be allowed to check and freeze the 
bank accounts of suspects. 
  People under investigation can also be photographed, videoed 
and tape recorded if necessary. 
  Four other measures cover the verification of reports, 
proof, 
further explanation and files. 
  Inspectors will be able to suspend suspects temporarily from 
their jobs. 
  These people will be prevented from going abroad or making 
business trips without the inspectors' approval.
