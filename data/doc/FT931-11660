FT  02 FEB 93 / Taiwan's ruling party faces power struggle
A PLAN by Taiwan's president, Mr Lee Teng-hui, to transfer power from
old-guard conservatives to a younger generation has triggered a power
struggle in the ruling Nationalist party, agencies report from Taipei.
Mr Hau Pei-tsun, the 73-year-old premier, announced at the weekend that he
would soon resign to mend a rift between liberal and conservative factions.
Mr Hau, leader of the conservative faction, is recommending that Mr Lin
Yang-kang, 65, head of the government's judicial branch, be chosen as his
successor.
Mr Lee is reported to favour Mr Lien Chan, 56, who now holds the post of
governor of Taiwan.
Pressure for Mr Hau's resignation increased after the Nationalists saw their
share of the vote plunge to a record low of 53 per cent in the December 19
parliamentary elections, the first in four decades.
When parliament convened yesterday, Nationalist legislators supporting Mr
Hau, in an apparent move to embarrass Mr Lee, did not back the party's
endorsement of Mr Liu Sung-fan as president of the parliament.
In addition, the 50 opposition lawmakers of the Democratic Progressive Party
walked out during the swearing-in ceremony and took their oaths outside the
meeting hall, saying they did not want to take the oaths in front of the
Nationalist flag.
The ruling party retained a parliamentary majority but the DPP more than
doubled its number of seats to 50 in the 161-seat legislature.
