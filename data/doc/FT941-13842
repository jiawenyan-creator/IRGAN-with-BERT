FT  24 JAN 94 / Belgium acts on resignation
The Belgian government yesterday replaced Mr Guy Coeme as deputy prime
minister, after his resignation last week in the wake of a corruption
scandal over a deal to buy army helicopters, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The francophone Socialist party (PS) picked Mr Elio di Rupo, 43, formerly a
regional minister, to succeed Mr Coeme.
Mr Coeme and two regional PS politicians resigned on Friday over allegations
that the Italian company Agusta paid bribes to secure a contract in 1988.
All three have denied wrongdoing.
