OXNARD COLLEGE PICKS TAYLOR TO DIRECT BASEBALL PROGRAM 
Dave Taylor, an assistant baseball coach at Oxnard College, was named Friday as 
head coach at the school, according to Ruth Hemming, Oxnard's vice president of 
student services. Taylor replaces Lindsay Meggs, who recently resigned to take 
the head coaching position at Long Beach City. 
Taylor and Meggs spent a season together as assistants at Cal Lutheran, and 
Taylor accompanied Meggs to Oxnard. Meggs spent one season at Oxnard. 
Taylor, an All-Ventura County shortstop at Rio Mesa High, played third base and 
catcher at Oxnard. He also played catcher on Arizona's 1986 national 
championship team and was a two-year letterman for the Wildcats. 
After his Arizona career, he spent three seasons in the minor leagues. 
Taylor also will work as a student teacher this fall at Channel Islands High 
while he completes the requirements of his teaching credential.
