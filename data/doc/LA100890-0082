PROTESTERS DECRY CUTS IN AIDS FUNDS 
About 250 shouting, whistle-blowing protesters marched down the city's main 
street to protest a proposed 86% cut in an AIDS emergency relief bill. 
"It means essentially no new money for AIDS programs at all, and it's going to 
affect people's lives," Robert Lowe, a member of ACT UP, told the crowd. 
Carrying banners and signs reading "Silence Death" and "Treatment Life," the 
crowd marched from U.N. Plaza near City Hall up Market Street to the Castro 
District. Demonstrators rallied at Market and Castro streets. Some protesters 
spray-painted slogans and outlines of bodies on the pavement. The protest was 
one of several throughout the country.
