 

(a) Gases present in the exhaust other than the one 
being analyzed can interfere with the reading in several 
ways. Positive interference occurs in NDIR and PMD 
instruments when the interfering gas gives the same effect 
as the gas being measured, but to a lesser degree. Negative 
interference occurs in NDIR instruments by the interfering 
gas broadening the absorption band of the measured gas and 
in CLD instruments by the interfering gas quenching the 
radiation. The interference checks described in this 
section are to be made initially and after any major repairs 
that could affect analyzer performance.

interference checks. 


Prior to its introduction into service and annually 
thereafter, the NDIR carbon monoxide analyzer shall be 
checked for response to water vapor and CO

2

: 

(1) Follow good engineering practices for instrument 
start-up and operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize 
performance on the most sensitive range to be used. 

(2) Zero the carbon monoxide analyzer with either 
zero-grade air or zero-grade nitrogen. 

(3) Bubble a mixture of 3 percent CO

2

 in N

2

 through water at room temperature and record analyzer response. 

(4) An analyzer response of more than 1 percent of full 
scale for ranges above 300 ppm full scale or more than 3 ppm 
on ranges below 300 ppm full scale requires corrective 
action. (Use of conditioning columns is one form of 
corrective action which may be taken.)

analyzer quench check. 

The two gases of 
concern for CLD (and HCLD) analyzers are CO

 and water 
vapor. Quench responses to these two gases are proportional 
to their concentrations and, therefore, require test 
techniques to determine quench at the highest expected 
concentrations experienced during testing.

A CO

 span gas 
having a concentration of 80 percent to 100 percent of full 
scale of the maximum operating range used during testing 
shall be passed through the CO

 NDIR analyzer and the value 
recorded as 

a.

 It is diluted approximately 50 percent with 
NO span gas and then passed through the CO

 NDIR and CLD (or 
HCLD), with the CO

 and NO values recorded as

 and 

c

 
respectively. The CO

 shall then be shut off and only the 
NO span gas passed through the CLD (or HCLD) and the NO 
value recorded as 

d.

analyzer water quench check. 

(i) This check 
applies to wet measurements only. An NO span gas having a 
concentration of 80 percent to 100 percent of full scale of 
a normal operating range shall be passed through the CLD (or 
HCLD) and the response recorded as 

D.

 The NO span gas shall 
then be bubbled through water at room temperature and passed 
through the CLD (or HCLD) and the analyzer response recorded 
as 

AR.

 Determine and record the analyzer absolute operating 
pressure and the bubbler water temperature. (It is 
important that the NO span gas contains minimal NO

2

 
concentration for this check. No allowance for absorption 
of NO

2

 in water has been made in the following quench 
calculations.) 

(ii) Calculations for water quench must consider 
dilution of the NO span gas with water vapor and scaling of 
the water vapor concentration of the mixture to that 
expected during testing. Determine the mixture's saturated 
vapor pressure (designated as 

Pwb

) that corresponds to the 
bubbler water temperature. Calculate the water 
concentration (Z1, percent) in the mixture by the following 
equation:
