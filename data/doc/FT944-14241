FT  24 OCT 94 / UK Company News: AAF lifted to Pounds 6.37m by disposal
AAF Industries, the building systems company which at the beginning of the
year announced that its overriding priority was survival, has announced
pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.37m for the six months to June 30 against losses
of Pounds 11m.
This was achieved by the Pounds 19m sale of Alloy Wheels International,
contributing Pounds 9.44m.
Turnover was cut to Pounds 29.6m (Pounds 42m), with Pounds 12.1m from
continuing operations, producing an operating loss of Pounds 2.47m; AWI
contributed an operating profit of Pounds 567,000.
The company's core operations are now the Formscaff scaffolding business,
Lab Furnishings, and Premier Transline modular buildings.
To turn operating losses into profits, AAF is concentrating on 'value
engineering and reducing the cost of operations,' said Mr Peter Cook,
finance director.
Overheads have been reduced by 25 per cent and are being further
rationalised.
Interest charges remained high at Pounds 1.17m (Pounds 1.3m), but will
decrease following the cut in net debt to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 21.9m).
Earnings per share were 28p (losses of 58p).
