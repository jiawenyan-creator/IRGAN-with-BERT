BUSH COMMENDS HOMELESS CENTER 
President Bush on Tuesday named the St. Vincent de Paul-Joan Kroc Center for 
the homeless in San Diego one of his "thousand points of light," an example of 
how volunteerism can help solve America's social problems. 
The 350-bed shelter for men is actually part of a larger St. Vincent de Paul 
Center, including a separate 150-bed shelter for families and others without a 
home. 
The men's shelter was opened in 1987 with the help of a $3.5-million gift from 
Joan Kroc, widow of the founder of the McDonald's restaurant chain and owner of 
the San Diego Padres baseball team. 
Kroc, who has donated millions to help the needy as well as in support of 
nuclear disarmament, also gave $1 million to the Democratic National Committee 
in 1987, making her the biggest donor in party history. Her late husband, Ray, 
was a major contributor to Republican causes.
