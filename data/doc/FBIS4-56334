<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Arnaldo Gonzalez -- live] </F>
  [Text] Thank you very much. We are again reporting from the 
entry to Puente Remanso where we are watching the famous Cacavel 
and Urutu tanks as they arrive on their way to Asuncion. There 
are approximately 20 tanks with turrets and other armored 
vehicles. The units are coming from Cavalry Regiment No. 2 of 
Cerrito. 
  We are counting the vehicles. They are two, four, six, 
eight, 
10. There are approximately 20 tanks and vehicles manned by 
soldiers in a state of readiness. Perhaps our cameraman Quinonez 
could show the soldiers. [video focuses on passing vehicles] 
Vehicles continue to come from Cerrito. We will go after them in 
order to find out where they are heading. 
  It is important to note that we have been told that more 
tanks are coming from this area. This is the first place from 
where tanks are being sent. Another group of military vehicles 
has gathered at the bridge's head and now are heading for 
Asuncion. We believe they are heading for the Campo Grande 
Cavalry unit. We will see what they will do. 
  [Studio announcer] It still remains to be seen whether this 
is part of normal maneuvers or a special mobilization. This 
morning, Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia said the Armed 
Forces are ready to intervene in the ongoing national strike, if 
requested. No official information has been released yet on this 
tank movement. [The same television station reports at 1455 GMT 
that the tanks and military vehicles have entered the RC-4 
Cavalry Regiment headquarters in Loma Pyta, about 10 kms from 
Asuncion.]
