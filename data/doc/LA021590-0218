D.C. MAYOR BARRY INDICTED ON DRUG, PERJURY COUNTS 
Marion Barry, mayor of Washington, was indicted by a federal grand jury today 
on five criminal counts of possessing cocaine and three counts of lying to a 
grand jury. 
Barry, one of the most prominent and controversial black politicians in the 
United States, was charged with possessing cocaine on four occasions in 1988 
and at the Vista International Hotel in downtown Washington on Jan. 18 when he 
was arrested in a police "sting" operation. 
Barry is undergoing treatment for substance abuse at a Florida clinic and has 
turned over the day-to-day operations of the district government to a city 
administrator. 
The indictment charged that during a Jan. 19, 1989, grand jury appearance Barry 
lied under oath by stating he was not aware that Charles Lewis was involved 
with drugs and by stating that the two men had not exchanged cocaine. 
Lewis, who is cooperating with the investigation, was recently sentenced to 15 
months in prison on drug charges. 
Each of the three false declaration charges carries a five-year prison term and 
a maximum fine of $250,000. 
Four charges against Barry involve alleged possession of cocaine between Dec. 
16-22, 1988, the period when Barry was visiting Lewis at the downtown Ramada 
Inn. 
The fifth drug-possession charge stems from Barry's Jan. 18 arrest at the Vista 
where he was visiting a former girlfriend, Rasheeda Moore.
