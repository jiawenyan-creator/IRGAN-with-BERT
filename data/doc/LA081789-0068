GLENDALE COUNCIL TENTATIVELY OKS A 3RD DOWNZONING 
The Glendale City Council gave preliminary approval Tuesday to the third 
proposal in three weeks by resident groups requesting zoning changes that would 
forbid apartment construction in their neighborhoods. 
The council voted to set public hearings for a group of 10 homeowners wanting 
to turn 18 multifamily-zoned properties in the 300 and 400 blocks of Mission 
Road into single-family lots. 
"The residential neighborhood's topography is hilly; most land parcels are 
small, and the streets are ill-equipped to accommodate the increased parking 
and traffic demands," City Planning Director John McKenna said in support of 
the proposal. 
The council is encouraging voluntary downzoning of neighborhoods from apartment 
to single-family zoning to deal with the city's population explosion.
