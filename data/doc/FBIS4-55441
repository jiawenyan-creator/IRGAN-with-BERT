  [Text] Belgrade, 16 May (TANJUG) -- The revision of the 
refugee status has been completed in most of the municipalities 
in Serbia, Slobodan Popovic, Serbian deputy commissionaire for 
refugees, has told TANJUG. "Between 20 and 35 percent 
previously registered refugees have lost their status in the 
municipalities which have completed the revision." Many of them 
are already planning to return, in most cases after the school 
year ends. Most of the refugees will be returning to the 
Banjaluka, Bijeljina, and Baranja regions," Popovic says. 
  The revision of the status has not been completed yet in 
Belgrade, Novi Sad, Sabac, Sombor, and Kragujevac, the 
municipalities with the largest number of registered refugees. 
The revision in these municipalities has been extended until 
the end of May. This process has been completed for between 25 
and 30 percent of all refugees registered in Belgrade.
