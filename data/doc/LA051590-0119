BRIEFLY 
Treasury Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury sold $8.4 billion of new three-month 
bills at an average discount rate of 7.67%, down from 7.79% last week. 
The Treasury also sold $8.4 billion of new six-month bills at an average 
discount rate of 7.68%, down from last week's 7.84%. The rates were the lowest 
since Feb. 12, when both three-month and six-month bills sold for 7.65%. The 
discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 7.93% for 
three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,806.10, and 8.10% for a 
six-month bill selling for $9,611.70. The discount rate reflects the price 
discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face 
value.
