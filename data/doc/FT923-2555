FT  17 SEP 92 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Third world rebounding
DEVELOPING countries are expected to record, this year and next, their
strongest economic growth in a decade, the International Monetary Fund says
in its World Economic Outlook.
Output in the developing world is projected to grow by 6.2 per cent in both
1992 and 1993, compared with 3.2 per cent in 1991. Senior IMF officials say
this strength is one of the main reasons behind their forecasts for an
economic recovery in the whole world.
The fund says the outlook has deteriorated in southern and eastern Africa,
scene of drought and civil war. Elsewhere, however, lower US interest rates,
with debt restructuring agreements, have mitigated the sluggishness of world
demand and the weakness of commodity prices.
The IMF acknowledges the impact of lower interest rates but attributes much
of the improvement in performance to the efforts of a increasing number of
countries to overhaul their economic structures. The IMF says as many as 35
countries, accounting for more than half of developing world output, can now
be said to have embarked on successful attempts at this kind of structural
adjustment.
'The key to their performance has been determined efforts to reduce fiscal
deficits and to control inflation. Equally significant has been their
recognition of the importance of market forces: most of these countries have
acted to liberalise foreign trade, to cut subsidies and to privatise state
enterprises,' the outlook says.
