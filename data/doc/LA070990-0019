MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK 
2 Live Crew Fans Rock the House: About 50 fans, angered because the 
controversial rap group 2 Live Crew refused to perform at a Dallas nightclub 
Saturday night, smashed wooden chairs, tables and windows while battling 
security officers. The group, whose album "As Nasty As They Wanna Be" was ruled 
obscene by a Florida judge, was given clearance by a Texas judge to perform at 
the Longhorn Ballroom. 
But a dispute over money developed between the band and the nightclub 
management, and the group, headed by Luther Campbell, never came on stage. More 
than three hours after the concert was to begin, witnesses said, an 
unidentified person announced over the public address system at 11:15 that the 
band would not appear if they did not get paid. When the band's stagehands 
began packing up the equipment 20 minutes later, a man demanding a refund 
jumped on stage and was dragged away by security personnel. Patrons then became 
angry, and a ruckus that lasted about 12 minutes erupted. Several people 
suffered minor injuries, but no arrests were reported. GREG BRAXTON
