FT  07 JUL 94 / People: Non-executive directors
Lady Gabrielle Greenbury, 39, is joining the board of PRINCEDALE GROUP, the
small marketing services company in which Sir Harry Solomon, the ex-chairman
of Hillsdown, has a substantial stake.
Lady Greenbury and her husband, Marks and Spencer chairman Sir Richard
Greenbury, are old friends of Sir Harry Solomon who stepped down as
Hillsdown's chairman last year. Sir Harry invested Pounds 650,000 in
Princedale a year ago when the company bought three of Hillsdown's
peripheral businesses.
Lady Greenbury, who also sits on the board of the National Theatre, has been
helping one of Princedale's design companies for some months.
