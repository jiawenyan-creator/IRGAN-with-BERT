BRIEFLY 
Dreyer's Hires New Ad Agency: San Francisco agency Goldberg Moser O'Neil 
Advertising, formed by former executives of Chiat/Day/Mojo, has won the account 
for Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc. The account has estimated annual billings of 
$8 million to $10 million. For the past year, Oakland-based Dreyer's has used 
independent free-lancers for the business. Prior to that, the Dreyer's account 
was with Hal Riney Partners, which developed the "unbelievable spokesman for an 
unbelievable product" campaign that featured such offbeat celebrities as G. 
Gordon Liddy and Zsa Zsa Gabor.
