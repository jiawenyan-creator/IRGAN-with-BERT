FT  23 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Trading in LDC loans regains
composure
TRADING in loans to less-developed countries regained some composure
yesterday following heavy price falls and hectic dealing activity last week.
The sell-off was sparked by increasing tension surrounding corruption
allegations levelled against Brazilian President Collor de Mello. The
uncertainty was seen as reducing the chances that Brazil will reach a
Brady-style debt restructuring agreement with creditors.
Yesterday, the price of Brazilian benchmark commercial bank debt stabilised
at around 34 1/2 per cent of face value, having plunged from around 40 per
cent to 30 per cent last week.
Nervousness spread to most areas of the LDC debt market as investors
withdrew, although there was no change in the economic fundamentals of most
countries.
The slide in the cash market was amplified in the price of warrants on LDC
debt recently issued by several investment banks.
For example, warrants issued by Paribas Capital Markets - which offer
holders the right to buy Brazilian DFA debt at 40 per cent of face value -
were yesterday quoted at 2 5/8 -3 1/8 per cent of face value, from an issue
price of 5.
