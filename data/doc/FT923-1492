FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: Bramalea loses CDollars 34min
first nine months
BRAMALEA, one of the three key property companies of Toronto's
Edper-Bronfman group, suffered a nine-month loss of CDollars 34m (USDollars
27.80m), or 38 cents a share, and warned that a further big write-down would
be taken in the fourth quarter.
Bramalea, caught in the North American property crisis, owns residential and
commercial properties and a large land-bank. It would not say how big the
fourth-quarter write-down would be, but analysts estimate it at up to
CDollars 500m.
The company has proposed a five-year restructuring designed to reduce total
debt from CDollars 4.5bn to CDollars 2bn and has already sold assets and
written down some carrying values.
Its bankers have agreed to defer principal and interest payments on land and
other non-revenue producing assets, but holders of CDollars 524m of secured
debentures are resisting a plan that would pay them in equity and give them
almost 50 per cent ownership.
Bramalea's revenues totalled CDollars 589m in the nine months, down 4 per
cent from a year earlier. The company reported a profit of CDollars 4.3m, or
2 cents a share in the 1991 period.
