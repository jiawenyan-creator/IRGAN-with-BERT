FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Loan-loss fall helps lift top
Canadian bank
Falling loan losses and strong investment banking income helped Royal Bank
of Canada to lift first-quarter earnings by 18 per cent.
The bank, which is Canada's biggest financial institution, predicted that a
continuing improvement in its loan portfolio, plus higher productivity,
would provide a 'solid level of profitability' this year.
Net earnings rose to CDollars 300m (USDollars 222.2m), or 82 cents a share,
for the three months to January 31, from CDollars 254m, or 71 cents a share,
a year earlier. Return on equity improved to 17.9 per cent from 14.8 per
cent.
Assets climbed to CDollars 168.2bn from CDollars 137bn, with more than half
the increase due to last year's acquisition of Royal Trust, the ailing trust
and loan company formerly controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family.
Return on assets slipped fractionally to 0.72 per cent from 0.73 per cent.
RBC is emerging from a turbulent period, which included the Royal Trust
acquisition as well as a heavy exposure to the troubled property and
forestry industries. The bank has also been criticised for weak internal
management.
Earnings have tumbled from a record CDollars 965m in 1990 to CDollars 107m
in 1992 and a CDollars 420m fourth-quarter loss last year.
The bank noted yesterday, however, that fiscal 1994 loan losses were
expected to fall to CDollars 820m from CDollars 1.75bn last year. The
first-quarter loan-loss provision was CDollars 205m, down from CDollars 295m
last year.
Non-accrual loans totalled CDollars 3.21bn on January 31, equal to 2.6 per
cent of total loans and acceptances. This was slightly lower than three
months earlier, but the decline was slowed by a further CDollars 46m
increase in sour commercial property loans.
A further cushion is provided by the rising market value of the bank's Third
World debt portfolio.
The surplus has grown over the past quarter, from CDollars 415m to CDollars
550m. Any of this surplus realised during 1994 will be transferred to
general loan-loss provisions.
Bank of Nova Scotia reported a 19.5 per cent jump in first-quarter earnings,
to CDollars 197m, or 82 cents a share, from CDollars 165m, or 70 cents a
share. Return on equity rose to 14.7 per cent from 13.9 per cent.
The improvement was attributed largely to higher interest income and
stronger investment-banking earnings.
