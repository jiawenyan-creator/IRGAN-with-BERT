FT  28 OCT 94 / Estonia picks Green premier
The Estonian parliament yesterday backed environment minister Mr Andres
Tarand as prime minister, averting the prospect of early elections in the
Baltic republic. Deputies voted by 63 in favour, with 15 abstentions and one
against, in support of Mr Tarand, who had been nominated for the post by
President Lennart Meri. Mr Tarand, a leading light in Estonia's Green
movement, will take over from Mr Mart Laar, who lost a confidence vote last
month because of what his critics saw as a high-handed, secretive style of
leadership. The appointment of Mr Tarand, a compromise candidate who does
not belong to any party, reflected a lack of enthusiasm among deputies for
early elections. Earlier this month, parliament rejected the president's
first choice, central bank governor Mr Siim Kallas. Mr Tarand said given
that elections were scheduled for next March he did not intend to initiate
any major changes to government policy.
