FT  13 FEB 93 / British Gas heads world profits table: Survey likely to
provoke row
BRITISH GAS is probably the most profitable gas transmission and
distribution company in the world, according to a study of the international
gas business by Sheffield Energy and Resources Information Services, an
energy consulting group.
In one of the first international comparisons of gas companies, British Gas
came top out of 41 companies worldwide, measured against three key criteria
to determine profitability. Second was Ruhrgas, Germany's main gas supplier,
and third was Gas Natural of Spain.
The findings are likely to prove controversial since British Gas remains the
monopoly supplier to its 18m UK household customers and is under review by
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Mr Ian Rutledge, one of the report's authors, said he was 'surprised and a
bit amused' by the outcome - the company had not planned the study as a
contribution to the debate about the future of British Gas.
The three criteria used for judging profitability were: operating profit on
the gas transmission part of companies' business, rate of return on gas
assets and operating profit per 1,000 cubic feet of gas production. These
were combined in a composite profitability index.
The report showed that gas companies were more than twice as profitable in
Europe and Australasia as in the US, where intense competition since market
deregulation 10 years ago has reduced margins.
Market liberalisation is occurring in many gas industries worldwide and the
report found that this was prompting increased internationalisation of the
world gas business. More competition had led to a drop in profitability
since 1985.
The average rate of return for a group of 31 companies fell to 7.8 per cent
in 1991 from 10.6 per cent in 1985.
