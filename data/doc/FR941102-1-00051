SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Federal Maritime Commission (``Commission'' or ``FMC'') published a Notice of Inquiry into alternative forms
of financial responsibility for nonperformance of transportation in the October 14, 1994 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 52133). Subsequent review after publication disclosed that the Notice of Inquiry failed to include language
to make clear that we are seeking comment on accepting, as evidence of financial responsibility, liens, mortgages
or other security instruments. Accordingly, the Notice is being revised in the following respects:





1. The second sentence of Part B (``Reinforced Self-Insurance'') is revised to read:




The Commission is concerned that its present self-insurance standards may be inadequate, but it will consider an
approach whereby it would restore its former ((net worth = 100% UPR) + (working capital = 100% UPR)) standard,17 but
require prospective self-insurers to provide alternative coverage for a percentage (

e.g.

, 50% or 25%) of their uncovered UPR, through either a traditional guaranty, surety, escrow agreement, lien or mortgage
or other security instrument, or through participation in a coverage association along the above-described lines.




2. The last sentence of Part C (``Coverage Requirements'') is revised to read as follows:




We also solicit comments on liens or mortgages or any other form of security or proposal that would provide adequate
coverage for the travelling public.




By the Commission.
