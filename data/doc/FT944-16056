FT  15 OCT 94 / Taiwan stocks plea rejected
Taiwan's central bank governor yesterday quashed calls to lift limits on
foreign investment in the country's stock market. Mr Liang Kuo-shu said:
'There is still room for foreign funds to enter the market, indicating no
urgency to raise the ceiling at moment.' A recent share payment default
crisis, which sparked a 14.7 per cent dive in share prices, has prompted
calls to increase the proportion of foreign investment in the market. Mr Day
Linin, chairman of the securities and exchange commission, called on the
central bank to raise the percentage of foreign investment to 10 per cent of
market capitalisation. Taiwan is one of the most restrictive equity markets
in Asia, with a ceiling on direct foreign investment in securities of
Dollars 7.5bn. But the central bank fears increased capital flows would make
it difficult to control the exchange rate and money supply.
