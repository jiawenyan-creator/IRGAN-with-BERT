FT  26 OCT 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Key employees miss out on
insurance - In a Nutshell
Small businesses are more likely to insure their furniture than their key
members of staff, according to a survey by Legal &amp; General insurance group.
A survey of 840 directors and managers from small firms revealed the loss of
a key person would cost, on average, Pounds 40,000 in the first year. L&amp;G
estimates there are about 175,000 small, limited companies with an uninsured
key person. Key protection cover is a form of short-term life or health
insurance.
