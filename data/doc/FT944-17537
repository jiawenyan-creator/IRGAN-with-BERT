FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Plantation &amp; Gen
Plantation &amp; General Invest-ments, formerly Chillington Corporation,
increased pre-tax profits by 20 per cent from Pounds 808,000 to Pounds
971,000 in the six months to June 30 1994.
Turnover from continuing operations declined to Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 23.7m).
Earlier this year the company decided to concentrate on developing its
plantation and overseas trading interests and consequently reverted to its
former name.
Mr Alan Tritton, chairman, said losses from discontinued activities had been
completely eliminated, Presswork &amp; Stampings had been sold and plans were
advanced to dispose of the company's interest in Chillington Marine.
A substantial advance was expected in the second half. The interim dividend
is raised to 1p (0.75p) on earnings per share of 1.36p (1.36p).
