FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance and the Family (The Budget and You): Lamont's
winners and losers
How will the Budget affect you? To help answer the question, Philip Coggan
and Scheherazade Daneshkhu asked Michael Bishopp and Clive Mackintosh, of
accountancy group Price Waterhouse's executive &amp; benefit services division,
to produce the following case studies.
They show how people will be affected by Norman Lamont's measures, many of
which passed through the Commons yesterday. Some might be repealed if there
is a Labour government, or a hung Parliament; others, such as the indexed
age allowances, are likely to remain.
TED HARKER is in his early 70s and living on a modest pension, plus income
from savings he accumulated while working. His total income is Pounds 15,000
(see table right). He is single, with no mortgage, and indulges moderately
in alcohol and cigarettes.
He benefits from the new 20 per cent band of income tax, on the first Pounds
2,000 of his taxable income. This will save him, like most other people,
Pounds 100 a year.
Ted also gains from the indexation of the age allowance. Those in the age
band 65-74 receive an allowance of Pounds 4,200 in 1992-93, compared with
Pounds 4,020 in 1991-92. However, Ted's allowance is reduced by Pounds 400,
because his income is Pounds 800 more than the new Pounds 14,200 threshold
for 'clawback' of age allowance. Clawback reduces the allowance by Pounds 1
for every Pounds 2 income exceeds the threshold.
This still leaves Ted much better off than in 1991-92, when the level at
which clawback started was Pounds 13,000, meaning that that he lost Pounds
1,000 of his allowance.
Compared with 1991-92, Ted saves Pounds 226 in tax. Even though he must pay
an extra Pounds 17 a year (33p a week) in excise duty, he is still Pounds
209 a year (Pounds 4.02 a week) richer. His net income has risen by 1.8 per
cent.
Had Ted earned Pounds 10,000 in total, his gains would have been reduced,
because he would not have the benefit of the increase in the age allowance
clawback threshold. His net gain would have been only Pounds 128 a year, or
Pounds 2.46 a week.
Pensioners who abstain from alcohol and tobacco will obviously do better out
of the Budget than Ted; those who consume more heavily will do worse. For
full details of the changes in age allowances for single and married
couples, see the table on Page II.
BEVERLEY Williams is a young, single woman earning Pounds 15,000 a year, and
living in rented housing. She is a moderate drinker, and has the odd
cigarette.
The Budget means that her income tax bill is reduced by Pounds 137.50 a
year. She gains from the introduction of the 20 per cent band on the first
Pounds 2,000 of her taxable income - a boost of Pounds 100 a year, or Pounds
1.92 a week. (See table right.)
A further reason for the cut in Beverley's tax bill is the increase in her
personal allowance from Pounds 3,295 to Pounds 3,445. That lifts her income
by another Pounds 37.50 a year, or 72p a week.
From April 5 she will also gain from a measure announced in the chancellor's
Autumn Statement. The base at which she starts paying National Insurance
contributions was increased from Pounds 52 a week to Pounds 54 a week. That
reduces her NI bill by Pounds 8 a year (15p a week).
The only real bad news in the Budget for Beverley is that her vices will
cost her more. Extra excise duty on alcohol and cigarettes will push up her
expenditure by Pounds 17 a year, or 33p a week.
The net effect is to reduce Beverley's total outgoings by Pounds 128.50 a
year, increasing her 'free income' from Pounds 10,313 to Pounds 10,441.50, a
net increase of 1.2 per cent. She is Pounds 2.47 per week better off.
DAVID Wallace and Caroline Campbell live in a house they bought together in
1989. They have a Pounds 50,000 mortgage, of which interest on the first
Pounds 30,000 is subject to relief under MIRAS. They both work for a
building society, earning Pounds 12,500 a year apiece.
David and Caroline are health conscious, and do not drink or smoke, and so
gain most from the Budget changes. Each prospers from the introduction of
the 20 per cent band, which saves the pair Pounds 200 a year in tax, and
from the increase in the single person's allowance, which benefits the
couple to the tune of Pounds 75 per annum. They do not, of course, receive
the married couple's allowance.
Their National Insurance charge also falls, by Pounds 15 a year between
them, as a result in the increase of the base level announced in the Autumn
statement.
There was no change in the MIRAS ceiling in the Budget. However, David and
Caroline will see a slight benefit. MIRAS relief will still be granted at 25
per cent on their interest payments, despite the fact that part of the
couple's income will henceforth be taxed at 20 per cent.
Overall, their outgoings will be reduced by Pounds 290 in the 1992-93 tax
year, a saving of Pounds 5.58 a week. Their net income, after mortgage
payments, will rise from Pounds 13,127 to Pounds 13,417, an increase of 2.2
per cent.
FIONA and Peter Elsworthy are married and have two children. Fiona is the
main breadwinner. She earns Pounds 40,000 a year as a solicitor and has a
company Golf GTI which completes the year with a business mileage of under
2,501 miles.
Peter, a librarian, earns Pounds 10,000. They have a Pounds 50,000 mortgage,
on which interest relief on the first Pounds 30,000 is available under
MIRAS. They both enjoy the occasional glass of wine or beer.
As a result of the Budget, both will pay less income tax because of the new
20 per cent band and the rise in personal allowances. Peter saves Pounds
137.50 a year as his tax bill drops from Pounds 1,246 to Pounds 1,109.
Fiona saves slightly more tax - Pounds 160 - because the rise in the
personal allowance delays the point at which she starts paying higher rate
tax. However, she cannot claim the married person's allowance until 1993.
Since she is the higher rate taxpayer, the two would have saved a further
Pounds 258 had Fiona been able to claim the Pounds 1,720 allowance on top of
her personal allowance.
The couple benefits from a rise in child benefit for the children, up from
Pounds 871 to Pounds 907, as a result of the Chancellor's Autumn Statement.
However, they spend an extra Pounds 17 in excise duties on drinks, and Fiona
has to pay an extra Pounds 84 in tax for her company car. The increase in
scale charges and petrol benefit means she will have to pay Pounds 1,914
instead of Pounds 1,830 for her Golf. She will also see an increase in her
NI contributions from Pounds 1,636 to Pounds 1,699. Luckily, Peter's NI
contributions drop by Pounds 8 to Pounds 703. The ceiling on NI
contributions will be raised from Pounds 390 a week to Pounds 410 a week
after April 5, as result of the Autumn Statement last year.
Peter and Fiona's net income after these changes has increased by Pounds 177
or Pounds 3.40 a week, a rise of around 0.6 per cent.
JAMES and Henrietta Hamilton are married with grown up children who have now
left home.
James earns Pounds 90,000 a year as the director of a trading company.
Henrietta does not work but enjoys an income of Pounds 10,000 a year from
shares and building society deposits.
James has a Jaguar from his company but hardly uses it for business. This
couple is the only example of people losing from the Budget.
The changes mean that both pay less income tax. James's tax bill falls by
Pounds 160 (see table below left) because of the rise in personal allowances
and the new 20 per cent band.
Henrietta's tax saving is smaller, at Pounds 137, although a greater
proportion of her income. Their collective tax saving is Pounds 297. The
introduction of the new 20 per cent tax band accounts for Pounds 200 of this
and the rest is due to the increase in their personal allowances.
On the downside, James's National Insurance contributions have increased by
Pounds 63 to Pounds 1,699, because of the Autumn Statement rise in the
contributions ceiling.
The increase in car benefit scales and petrol benefit charges means that his
Jaguar is now costing him Pounds 5,956 in tax instead of Pounds 5,700 to run
 -an addition of Pounds 256 a year. The couple enjoy malt whisky and the odd
Chateau Margaux though neither smokes. The increase in their excise duty
bill is Pounds 34 a year.
The reason they are worse off after the Budget, despite the introduction of
the new 20 per cent band, is that the reduction in income tax is not enough
to compensate for the rise in duty on alcohol, the company car scale rates
and his National Insurance contributions. The total increase in cost to
James and Henrietta is modest, at Pounds 56 a year, or Pounds 1.08 a week.
The change will hardly ruin them - the fall in their net income is just 0.1
per cent.
And if James had owned his own business - a trading company worth around
Pounds 1m - there would have been an inheritance tax bill of roughly Pounds
200,000 to pay on the shares when he died. If the Conservatives are
re-elected and the Budget proposals on IHT are enacted, the whole of the
business will be exempt from the tax.
