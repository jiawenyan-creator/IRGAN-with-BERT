  [Text] Another big step has been made in Sino-Russian 
cooperation in disposing of nuclear waste. Chang Chung-chien, 
chairman of the board of Taipower, and a concerned Russian 
department have reached common understanding on specific matters 
in this regard. The two sides will sign a letter of intent in 
the near future regarding nuclear waste disposal, thereby 
binding Russia to be Taiwan's partner in disposing of our highly 
radioactive nuclear waste. Furthermore, cooperation between the 
two sides will expand to cover the analysis of highly 
radioactive nuclear waste material and the study of nuclear 
reactors. This will be the first tangible result we have 
achieved since deciding that nuclear waste will be disposed 
primarily outside the country. 
  At the invitation of the Russian National Academy of 
Sciences, Chang Chung-chien recently went to Moscow again to 
discuss cooperation in the disposal of nuclear waste. He said 
the primary purpose of his Moscow trip was to express the great 
importance Taipower attaches to the cooperation. He also 
visited the nuclear energy research facility of the Russian 
National Academy of Science. He said: Russia has a solid 
foundation for the study of nuclear energy. Russia has 
expressed strong desire to cooperate with us and Taipower will 
be delighted to see successful cooperation between the two sides 
in the disposal of nuclear waste.
