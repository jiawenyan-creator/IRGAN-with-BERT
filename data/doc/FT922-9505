FT  07 MAY 92 / ADB renews call to fight Asian poverty
THE Asian Development Bank closed its annual meeting yesterday with renewed
calls to step up the war against poverty and environmental degradation in
Asia's fast-growing economies, Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
But some delegates privately attacked the bank for what they see as its
flabby response to the region's growing social needs and inability to trim
its bureaucracy. The task of meeting growing social and infrastructure needs
at a time of shrinking funds from rich member-nations such as the US was a
main theme at the ADB's three-day meeting of Asian finance ministers and
international bankers.
ADB president Kimimasa Tarumizu urged more efficient use of resources to
tackle the bank's priorities for the 1990s. 'Global changes have created new
demands on the flow of resources; the need to augment these flows becomes
more important,' he said. The US delegation has vowed to oppose an early
increase in the bank's capital until it sees more evidence to back the
request. Last year, the bank proposed its capital base of Dollars 23bn
(Pounds 12.9bn) be doubled by 1994.
