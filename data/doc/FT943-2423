FT  19 SEP 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news

growth in Japan's M2 money supply is expected to have remained steady at 1.9
per cent for August.
Tuesday: US international trade figures will be watched by markets fearing a
widening of the monthly trade deficit following dollar weakness.
Wednesday: Analysts will take a primarily academic interest in the minutes
from the July 28 UK monetary meeting between Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of
the exchequer, and Eddie George, Bank of England governor, in view of last
Monday's base rate rise.
Friday: The UK second quarter balance of payments will be viewed in the
context of an excellent performance by invisibles in the first quarter,

Pounds 1.3bn deficit.
Also: The second quarter Japanese GDP figure is expected this week to
confirm the view that the economy is slowly on the mend.
German consumer prices will be watched for signs of inflation, while the
data on M3 money supply is expected to show slow growth.
