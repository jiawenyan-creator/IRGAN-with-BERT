  [Excerpt] Defense Minister Edmundo Perez and General 
Augusto Pinochet today met for more than four hours at the Armed 
Forces building. Perez's visit was an unprecedented event in the 
past four years considering that former Defense Minister 
Patricio Rojas never visited this place. 
  However, the guards stood in line early today to honor the 
minister. Perez, who accepted the commander in chief's 
invitation, was warmly welcomed by Gen. Pinochet. This gesture 
adds to others that clearly show the mutual wish to improve the 
links between the Army and the government that started under the 
Coalition of Parties' administration. Pinochet, accompanied by 
Army Deputy Commander Jorge Lucar, introduced Perez to all 
members of the General Staff. Each officer briefed Perez on the 
Army's mission and organization. 
  After the approximately four-hour visit to the Armed Forces 
building, Perez agreed to talk with the press for the first time 
since he was installed as defense minister: 
  [Begin recording] [Perez] I think relations are improving. 
The good relations under President Aylwin's administration 
gradually increased and I am only trying to deepen them. 
  [Unidentified reporter] But there were problems under the 
former administration. Do you think they will occur again? 
  [Perez] I don't think so; I do not perceive them in the 
current atmosphere. 
  [Reporter] Do you maintain a good personal relation with 
Gen. 
Pinochet? 
  [Perez] I do not think it is appropriate to talk about 
personal relations, but about relations between a defense 
minister and a commander in chief within the existing legal 
framework. [end recording] [passage omitted]
