FT  28 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Graduate market forces already
working
Sir, It is well known that all published statistics are well out of date. A
further example is evident in your article, 'First fall for five years in
graduate unemployment' (June 20), which states that unemployment rates were
worst for mathematicians (13.4 per cent in 1992-93).
GAAPS is an international search and selection consultancy specialising in
actuaries and therefore not in the graduate recruitment market.
Despite this, we have been contacted by a number of insurance companies,
which are our clients, asking us as a special favour to find good science
graduates who wish to enter the actuarial profession.
We were at first surprised that they had not been able to fill their
vacancies themselves on the 'milk round'. On contacting professors we know
(I have an academic background), we found that most of this year's graduates
have been found 'homes'.
Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, is worried that
employers are not sending the right signals to the jobs market. I am also
worried. My concern is that these out-of-date statistics will put into force
government policy that will result in a huge increase in the number of
science graduates.
Market forces are already in motion and therefore, instead of creating
equilibrium, a surplus may be created.
