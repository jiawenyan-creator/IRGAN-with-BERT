<F P=106> [News conference given by Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo, </F>
chairman of the High Council of the Republic, at the 
Inter-Diocesan Center in Kinshasa on 17 January; recorded] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen, the week of 9-16 January will 
remain a historic week for our country Zaire. In fact, during 
that week, all the necessary conditions for a happy ending of 
the political consultations at the Palais du Peuple were 
practically met. Actually, as far as we know, all the various 
components of the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR] 
and the Political Forces of the Conclave [FPC], have either 
signed or have made up their mind to sign the protocol accord 
issued at the end of that political consultation. We take note 
of this fact and also note with joy the desire clearly expressed 
by the entire political class to see a successful end to the 
negotiations of the Palais du Peuple and implement them in 
accordance with laid down procedures and in conformity with the 
accord concluded. 
  We congratulate all the parties engaged in the negotiations 
for the results obtained. We urgently ask them not to 
compromise the results of such a delicate and tedious work. 
That is why we deplore the fact that the calm atmosphere of 
dialogue and tolerance that prevailed throughout the political 
negotiations is now giving place to upset and a partisan spirit 
of intolerance and mistrust. It would be criminal to turn into 
failure all the 10 months of efforts deployed to find a solution 
to this political crisis which has been the bane of our people. 
We therefore call on all the political parties and their 
leaders to refrain from any declarations, attitudes, and acts 
likely to inflame passions, poison the situation, and drive away 
forever a solution which is already so close. We invite all 
political leaders to work toward a harmonious end as well as the 
implementation of the accords of the Palais du Peuple.
