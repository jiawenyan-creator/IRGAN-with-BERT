FT  10 FEB 92 / Supermarket food seen as expensive
MANY SHOPPERS believe that food prices are high in big supermarkets,
according to a survey published today.
Verdict, the retail consultants, found that 57 per cent of shoppers thought
that most products were expensive in supermarkets.
Just over 30 per cent disagreed, while the remainder had no opinion.
The findings might spur a further round of price-cutting by the big
supermarket chains with the aim of influencing public perceptions.
In the past few months, J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Asda have all run aggressive
price-cutting promotions. These have been partly a response to recent media
reports which suggested they were charging higher prices than food retailers
in other European countries.
However, in a separate report on the structure of the food retailing
industry, Business Strategies (BSL), an economic research group, largely
absolves the supermarkets of the charge that they are making excessive
pro-fits.
BSL criticises those who have made much of the differences in margins
between UK and continental European food retailers. It says the most
efficient operators in the UK enjoy net margins of more than 6 per cent or
about double those achieved on the Continent.
BSL argues that this disparity is largely accounted for by differences in
accounting and taxation practice, law and commercial philosophy.
The return on capital employed by UK food retailers is very similar to that
on the Continent, it suggests.
Verdict's study showed the recession has been markedly influencing consumer
shopping patterns.
It found that 42 per cent of shoppers were adopting a more tactical approach
to shopping and were waiting to make their big purchases in sales.
