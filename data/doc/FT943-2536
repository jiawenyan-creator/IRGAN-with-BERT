FT  19 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Continental cuts fares to US for
penny-pinchers
Continental Airlines is wooing the new breed of penny-pinching business
travellers, forced by their employers to fly economy class, by cutting its
full unrestricted economy fares across the Atlantic by more than 40 per
cent.
The large US carrier is launching what it calls 'corporate economy fares'
between London and 28 US destinations.
The airline said research had shown that business travellers flying in the
economy cabin were unhappy with the high price they had to pay for
flexibility. Unlike the leisure traveller, who often sacrifice flexibility
for price, the business traveller needed to have a refundable ticket that
could be changed at short notice.
Continental's new fares will, subject to government approval, cut the
one-way price between London and New York from Pounds 423 to Pounds 249. One
way from London to Houston will be Pounds 319 and to Denver Pounds 339.
The latest move by Continental is being closely watched by rivals. The UK's
Virgin Atlantic, which offers a separate Mid Class cabin for passengers
paying the full economy fare, said it was considering whether to match the
new fares.
United of the US said: 'If it's something where we compete directly with
Continental, we will match their fares.'
