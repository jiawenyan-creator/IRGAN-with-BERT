FT  17 APR 93 / UK Company News: Barclays launches Dollars 300m bond in US
BARCLAYS yesterday embark-ed on its second capital-raising exercise in a
week when it launched a Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) fixed-rate bond issue in
the US which will count as tier two capital for regulatory purposes.
The issue is the first by a bank in the US market which is convertible into
preference shares, which count as so-called tier one or core capital under
Basle committee guidelines. The Basle rules require banks to hold capital
equal to more than 8 per cent of assets, at least half of this in the form
of core capital.
The bonds are structured to allow Barclays to claim the tax-deductibility of
interest payments before conversion, while leaving it with the option at any
time to convert into tier one capital and so boost its core capital ratio.
The bonds, which Barclays expects to be sold mainly to retail investors in
the US, carry an indicative coupon of 8 per cent. If converted, the
preference shares will pay 9 1/4 per cent.
Mr Brian Worsley, assistant treasurer, said the issue was structured in a
way to discourage the bank to convert. If it did so, the higher interest
rate and loss of tax relief would raise its financing costs by more than two
percentage points. Also, the bank had a tier two ratio of 4.4 per cent at
the end of last year, compared with tier one of 5.8 per cent, leaving it
with little need to create more core capital.
The bonds yielded about 125 basis points over the US government's 30-year
long bond yesterday. Barclays raised Pounds 200m in the Eurobond market a
week ago.
