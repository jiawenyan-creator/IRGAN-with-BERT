Airworthiness Directives: Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation 500, 600, and 700 Series Airplanes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment supersedes Airworthiness Directive (AD) 650601, which currently requires repetitively
inspecting the wing front spar lower cap (spar cap) of both the left and right wings on certain Twin Commander Aircraft
Corporation (Twin Commander) 500 and 600 series airplanes, and replacing any cracked spar cap. Front spar cap cracks
developing on certain Twin Commander model airplanes not affected by that AD prompted this action. In addition, the
manufacturer has updated the inspection procedures through improved service information. This action retains
the inspection and repair requirements of AD 650601, and requires inspecting in accordance with updated
service information and increases the applicability to include other model airplanes. The actions specified by
this AD are intended to prevent failure of the wing structure caused by cracks in the spar cap.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Effective April 12, 1994.



The incorporation by reference of Twin Commander Service Bulletin (SB) No. 90C, dated March 30, 1992, and Twin Commander
Service Publications revision notice of SB 90C, Revision 1, dated June 5, 1992, is approved by the Director of the Federal
Register as of April 12, 1994.

The incorporation by reference of the instructions to Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK145, dated August 21,
1992, was previously approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of April 11, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that would apply to certain Twin Commander
500, 600, and 700 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register 

on June 30, 1993 (58 FR 34955). The action proposed to supersede AD 650601 with a new AD that would (1) retain
the inspection and repair requirements of the spar caps required by AD 650601; (2) incorporate the updated
service information into the proposed AD; and (3) increase the effectivity of the current AD to include other airplane
models of the Twin Commander 500, 600, and 700 series. The proposed inspections would be accomplished in accordance
with Twin Commander SB No. 90C, dated March 30, 1992, and Twin Commander Service Publications revision notice of SB
No. 90C, Revision 1, dated June 5, 1992.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the 10 comments received.

Nine commenters concur with the proposal as written.

Twin Commander supports the proposal and makes recommendations. Twin Commander states that the Compliance section
of the proposal contains the following: ``*** or 500 hours after the wing front lower spar cap was replaced
in accordance with one of the three modifications referenced in paragraph (b) of this AD ***'', and
points out that paragraph (b) of this AD only specifies two modifications and that the wording in the Compliance section
of the proposal should be changed accordingly. The FAA concurs and has changed the proposed AD by inserting the words
``in accordance with one of the two modifications'' in place of ``in accordance with one of the three modifications''
under the Compliance section.

Twin Commander also states that the proposed AD should include the Model 680F(P) airplanes in the applicability to
coincide with SB 90C. The FAA concurs that these airplanes should be included. Adding this airplane model to the applicability
goes beyond the scope of what was originally proposed, and would obligate the FAA to issue a supplemental notice of
proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to allow additional time for the public to comment. The FAA has determined that the additional
comment time is unnecessary for the model airplanes included in the applicability of the proposed AD, and, after the
proposed rule becomes final, the FAA will issue an NPRM to add the Model 680F(P) airplanes into the applicability of
that AD. The proposed rule is unchanged as a result of this comment.

After careful review of all available information including the comments referenced above, the FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for the minor wording change
and other minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these minor corrections will not change the meaning
of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed.

The FAA estimates that 1,303 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
32 (average) workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately
$55 an hour. Parts are not required for 1,054 airplanes, and parts cost approximately $700 per airplane for 105 airplanes
and $1,700 per airplane for 144 airplanes. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspections specified
in this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,611,580 (cost per airplane varies by model).
