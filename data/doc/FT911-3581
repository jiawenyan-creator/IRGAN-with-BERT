FT  24 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: ICSA calls for greater
international consultation in securities regulations
The International Councils of Securities Associations (ICSA), which
represents self-regulatory authorities in the leading financial centres,
closed its meeting in London with a call for greater international
consultation in securities regulation, writes Simon London.
The two-day meeting discussed ways of improving the efficiency of
multi-national securities offerings, the detection of malpractice in
cross-border dealings and licensing of securities industry professionals to
work internationally.
One area of concern is the delay in formulating capital adequacy guidelines
for securities houses. Delays were placing securities firms at a competitive
disadvantage, commented Mr Robin Hutton, director-general of the British
Merchant Banking and Securities Houses Association.
Capital adequacy requirements for the securities industry are being examined
by the Basle group of central bank regulators, the European Commission and
the US and Japanese regulatory authorities. However, no guidelines are
expected to be published before the end of this year.
