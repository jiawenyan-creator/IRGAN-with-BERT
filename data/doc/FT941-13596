FT  25 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Birth pangs of PIA do not augur well
Sir, The complacency of the letter from the president of the Life Insurance
Association (January 21) is breathtaking in its implication that there is
nothing amiss with the selling practices of the life insurance industry.
No doubt most transactions proceed smoothly and are in the interest of the
consumer (so they should be), but what about the thousands of elderly people
talked into home income plans, the thousands of members of occupational
pension schemes persuaded to transfer to personal pensions, the thousands of
home-owners who took out endowment mortgages when repayment mortgages would
have been more appropriate?
As a writer of reports on marketing subjects I come into contact with many
industries, all of which have special problems and feel themselves to be
misunderstood, but in my experience the life insurance industry is the most
obscurantist.
Its self-regulatory organisations all too often behave more like trade
associations than consumer protection bodies and the pangs that are
attending the birth of the Personal Investment Authority do not augur well
for its future.
It has not been to the interest of the British consumer that investment and
protection have become so intertwined in the world of personal financial
services.
