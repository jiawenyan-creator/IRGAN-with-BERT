FT  03 SEP 92 / UN says N-threat over
IRAQ's nuclear programme has been 'neutralised', the head of the latest
United Nations weapons inspection team said in Baghdad yesterday. 'It stands
at zero now,' said Mr Maurizio Zifferero.
Mr Zifferero, deputy director of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), said the programme had been rendered harmless both through the
efforts of repeated UN inspection teams and by allied bombing during the
Gulf war.
Mr Zifferero, who is heading the 14th visit to Iraq by UN nuclear
inspectors, said: 'We're completing our investigation of the (nuclear)
programme and find no evidence of the programme being continued.'
He added that the UN teams had searched for evidence that the Iraqis had
secret underground nuclear complexes but inspectors found nothing.
But IAEA officials in Vienna emphasised that tough UN inspections of Iraq's
nuclear-related sites and equipment would continue indefinitely.
Officials said some equipment remained to be destroyed under the terms of
the Gulf war ceasefire, while inspectors would also want to ensure that Iraq
did not covertly resume work on developing its nuclear potential.
The IAEA also says it has made no progress in persuading Iraq to reveal
either the procurement network which gave it access to highly sensitive
nuclear technology, or the identities of foreign experts believed to have
advised Iraq on its nuclear programme.
