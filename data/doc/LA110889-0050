KITTY DUKAKIS HOSPITALIZED; ILLNESS HELD NOT DRUG-RELATED 
Kitty Dukakis, wife of Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, was in a hospital 
intensive-care unit Tuesday as doctors tried to diagnose her illness. 
The governor's spokeswoman said initial tests were inconclusive, but indicated 
that the ailment was not drug- or alcohol-related. 
"Mrs. Dukakis is tired of tests, but she's feeling OK. She's up, she's alert," 
spokeswoman Minday Lubber said. 
She was taken by ambulance Monday night to Brigham and Women's Hospital after 
several days of flu-like symptoms, Lubber said. 
"I don't know if it's flu-related. I know she was feeling groggy," Lubber said. 
"She's had the flu. She's been feeling tired. Last night she was feeling 
particularly lethargic." 
Earlier this year, Kitty Dukakis underwent four weeks of treatment for 
alcoholism. She said previously that she had been addicted to diet pills for 
years. 
She also underwent neck surgery last year while her husband was running for 
President. 
Lubber said the governor had been at his wife's side much of Monday night and 
Tuesday. He did not immediately comment. 
Hospital officials refused to provide any information, but said admission to 
the intensive-care unit was standard under such circumstances.
