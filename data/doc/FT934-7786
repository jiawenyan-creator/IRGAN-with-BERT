FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Donna Karan suspends IPO
DONNA KARAN, the New York fashion house, yesterday threw a bucket of cold
water on the over-heated market for sexy initial public offerings (IPOs) by
suspending its plans to go public.
The company, which is known for its upmarket collections of clothing and
accessories, said it had decided to delay its initial public offering
because sales and operating earnings in the third quarter had fallen short
of its expectations. It blamed 'a soft retail environment'.
Ms Donna Karan, the designer who founded the company in 1986, said: 'We
don't feel that a public offering at this time would reflect the potential
value of the company.'
The decision to delay the offering comes at a time when investors are
especially keen to invest in IPOs by companies with high-profile businesses.
Last week, Boston Chicken soared 143 per cent higher than its offering price
of Dollars 20 a share on the issue's first day of trading on the Nasdaq
over-the-counter market.
The Donna Karan issue of 11m shares, or 57 per cent of the company, had been
expected to come to market this month. However, in an amended registration
statement filed in October with the US Securities and Exchange Commission,
the company hinted that a snag might develop.
It indicated that some of its clothing lines for men and children would
continue to generate losses during the rest of 1993.
The original filing statement said that the operations would begin to break
even in 1993.
The offering, with an estimated listing price of Dollars 15 to Dollars 18 a
share, was expected to raise about Dollars 159m.
