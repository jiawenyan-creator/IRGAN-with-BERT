FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Accor sees disposals as key to
reduced gearing
ACCOR, the French hotels-to-luncheon vouchers group, is to slow its pace of
expansion and make up to FFr3bn (Dollars 551m) of disposals by the end of
1994 to reduce its gearing to less than 100 per cent.
Mr Paul Dubrule, co-chairman, said in London yesterday that the group's
profits would fall to FFr800m this year, compared with FFr948.6m in 1991.
Accor - which over the past two years has acquired Wagons-Lits, the Belgian
travel company, and Motel 6, the US hotel chain - puts its current gearing
at 111 per cent.
Mr Dubrule said the group expected to announce within the next 15 days that
it had sold Wagons-Lits' French motorway restaurants business to an unnamed
European buyer for more than FFr500m. The European Commission last April
instructed Accor to sell the restaurants because they would have given the
group too dominant a position.
Mr Dubrule said Accor would sell Europcar, its vehicle rental company, if it
did not achieve profitability by next year. Europcar is a joint venture with
Volkswagen.
He said Accor would seek substantial savings through greater use of its
subsidiaries' joint buying power. As the owner of travel agencies, Accor was
a large customer of carriers such as Air France and British Airways, who in
turn used the group's hotels. It would use this dual position to gain better
deals from airlines.
Sellers of the company's luncheon vouchers were working more closely with
Accor's corporate catering arm. If customers did not want luncheon vouchers,
sales staff were now suggesting they look at the group's catering services.
Mr Dubrule said that although Accor still wanted to expand, the growth of
its hotel network would be considerably slower than in previous years.
