GOVERNMENT STING USED AGAINST WASHINGTON'S MAYOR BARRY 
As a former journalist for The Guardian (Manchester, England) I am taken aback 
by the cheapening of traditional media standards in this country. I refer in 
particular to the nationwide publication of the Barry videotape, surely a porno 
show free to everyone including the school kiddies. 
Even The Times' editorial "Can't Do Business Without Customers" (July 2) didn't 
really need an accompanying replay picture of the mayor smoking crack in his 
shirt sleeves. 
This kind of journalism raises the question, "Isn't it in violation of the law 
when a case is before the court to allow all this public comment with 
illustrations?" 
If the FBI needs evidence to prove Barry's guilt, they've got it. They don't 
need to flaunt it and make it a press handout.
