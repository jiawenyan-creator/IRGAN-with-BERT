FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Temporary halt to IBM's OS/2
Warp shipments
International Business Machines has been forced to temporarily halt
shipments of its new personal computer operating system, OS/2 Warp, because
of a software bug that interferes with loading the software on to some PCs.
IBM said the problem is minor and that retailers will receive shipments of
OS/2 Warp on schedule. People who have already purchased the program will be
sent a new version.
The incident is an embarrassment for IBM, which is mounting a Dollars 50m
advertising campaign for Warp in an attempt to win ground in the PC
operating system software market which is dominated by Microsoft's Windows.
Microsoft has shipped more than 50m copies of Windows, compared with the
almost 6m copies of OS/2 that IBM has shipped.
