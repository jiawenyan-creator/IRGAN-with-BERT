<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice proposes to require Type 2 safety belts either to be integrated with the vehicle seat or to provide a means
of adjustability to improve the fit and increase the comfort of the belt for a variety of different sized occupants.
NHTSA believes that some occupants who find their safety belts to be uncomfortable, either wear their safety belts
incorrectly or do not wear their safety belts. NHTSA believes that improving safety belt fit will encourage the correct
use of safety belts and could have the potential to increase the overall safety belt usage rate.

<DATE>
DATES:

 

Comment Date: 

Comments on this notice must be received by NHTSA not later than June 27, 1994. 





Effective Date: 

If adopted, the proposed amendment would become effective September 1, 1996.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 



Section 2503(4) of the ``Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991'' requires the NHTSA to address
the matter of improved design for safety belts (Pub. L. 102240). In response to this statutory mandate, NHTSA
issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) on May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22687). The ANPRM listed three rulemaking
options and posed ten questions. The options included:




A. Take No Regulatory Action at This Time. 

B. Adopt Detailed Regulatory Requirements to Ensure Proper Belt Fit. 

C. Adopt a General Requirement that Safety Belts Adjust to Fit Different Sized Occupants.




The ten questions asked for information on costs and benefits, and for comments on the test procedure. The ANPRM also
included a discussion of the types of complaints the agency receives concerning belt fit. Finally, the ANPRM explained
that any proposal addressing safety belt fit will encourage the correct use of safety belts and could have the potential
to increase safety belt use. Of those persons who currently do not use safety belts because of improper fit, some would
respond to the improved fit by beginning to use their belts or by wearing them more frequently. 



Research 



Since the ANPRM, the agency has conducted research on the issue of safety belt fit. A detailed discussion of this research
can be found in a technical paper titled ``Improved Design for Safety Belts,'' a copy of which has been placed in the
docket for this rulemaking. For this paper, the agency surveyed eight vehicles with non-adjustable shoulder belts
and seven vehicles with various types of adjustable shoulder belts to determine how well the belts fit a family of dummies
(the six-year-old, the 5th percentile female, the 50th percentile male, and the 95th percentile male). The survey
used the comfort zone described in the ANPRM (Option B), modified as appropriate for the different sized dummies.


In the vehicles with non-adjustable shoulder belts, the belt was within the comfort zone 32.3 percent of the time for
the six-year-old dummy, 94.3 percent for the 5th percentile female, 51.2 percent for the 50th percentile male, and
57.1 percent for the 95th percentile male. For the adult dummies, these results do not correlate with the pattern of
belt fit complaints received by the agency. The complaints are often from shorter adults, suggesting that height
may not be the only factor that affects safety belt fit. For example, the agency observed that, for two persons of the
same height, the belt path was higher (approaching the neck) on the person with a larger torso. The agency also observed
that belts tend to ride higher on the torso as the relative position of the belt anchorage and seat are changed so that
the anchorage is farther to the rear in relation to the seat. This movement of the belt occurs because the belt tends
to seek the straightest line path between its anchorages. 

In vehicles with adjustable shoulder belts, the belts were within the comfort zone 33.3 percent of the time for the
six-year-old dummy, 95 percent for the 5th percentile female, 85.7 percent for the 50th percentile male, and 100 percent
for the 95th percentile male. These results show that currently available adjustable shoulder belt designs do improve
safety belt fit for adults. The significantly lower percentage of both non-adjustable and adjustable belts within
the comfort zone for the six-year-old dummy suggests that additional means, such as booster seats, are necessary
for comfortable belt fit for such persons. Booster seats will raise the proper fit to over 80 percent.
