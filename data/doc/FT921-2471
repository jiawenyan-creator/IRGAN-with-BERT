FT  19 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report
London's robusta COFFEE ended an afternoon of nervous trading with moderate
gains but just below the day's highs as the market waited for the outcome of
talks in Brazil on official policy to wards a coffee pact. 'We started up
this afternoon with New York looking terrible, but then suddenly near May
shot ahead and London just went with it,' one trader said yesterday. The
upside move was attributed to unconfirmed rumours that the Brazilian private
sector had decided to support a pact with economic clauses after an informal
meeting in the morning. On the LME COPPER maintained its recent strength as
Tuesday's constructive US economic data helped to hold three-month metal
above Dollars 2,240 a tonne. Prices have encountered good support on dips
towards Dollars 2,220 recently and the market looks set to move up to a
Dollars 2,275 target. The ALUMINIUM market consolidated Tuesday's move above
Dollars 1,300 for three-month metal. Overhead resistance is expected between
Dollars 1,315 and Dollars 1,320. NICKEL was under pressure from talk that
fresh Russian metal was en route to Rotterdam although scale-down buying
limited the extent of price falls. Earlier, the market was boosted by news
of strike action at Western Mining's Kambalda facilities.
