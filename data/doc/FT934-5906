FT  27 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: The unmeasured threat from nuclear
power station emissions
Sir, I have lived for 32 years on the opposite bank of a river where one of
Britain's nuclear power stations is situated. I have during the last two
months developed acute myeloid leukaemia for which, at my age (72), there is
no cure. When I entered hospital the leukaemia cells made up 6 per cent of
my bone marrow.
Judge my astonishment when, on making inquiries, I found that emissions from
the station are not monitored continuously, but only once a month. During
this time radiation can be emitted from the heavily contaminated CO into the
steam and hence to the atmosphere without being picked up. So the public is
not warned.
Having read all the latest papers, I am in no doubt that the cause of my
leukaemia is radiation from the nuclear power station. It has probably
resulted in the mutilation of one of my cells and this then spread.
In my view, no further nuclear stations should be built until the cause of
leukaemia near nuclear stations has been resolved. Do we have to wait 10 or
20 years for this to be done? Further, the latest medical papers state there
is no known safe minimum dose. G A H Watts,
