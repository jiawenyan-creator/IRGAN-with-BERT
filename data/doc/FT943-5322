FT  05 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Ukraine flight
After more than two years of unsuccessful attempts, Ukraine's financially
troubled national airline began a service from Kiev to Hungary last
Thursday.
Air Ukraine has announced several times since 1992 that it would start a
twice-weekly service to Budapest but was unable to do so due to technical
and financial problems.
