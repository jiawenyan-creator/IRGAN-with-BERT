FT  19 APR 93 / UK Company News: Enlarged Swallowfield declines to Pounds
1.27m
A REDUCTION in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 1.27m, was
announced by Swallowfield, the Somerset-based personal care products
manufacturer, for the year to end-December.
Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 22.9m).
Mr Terry Organ, the chairman, said that Pounds 1.8m of turnover had come
from Parbel Belgium, acquired in July, which had provided an opening to
continental Europe.
He said the group was still working to turn Parbel round. Its losses were
shown as Pounds 37,000.
Interest charges rose following the acquisition and gearing was back up to
84 per cent, he said. However, he expec-ted that figure to fall this year.
Earnings per share slipped to 7.3p (13p) and the proposed final dividend is
cut to 2.2p (3.9p) for a reduced total of 4.4p (6.1p).
