(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, exposure to the specified vesicant agents during active military
service under the circumstances described below in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section together with the
subsequent development of any of the indicated conditions is sufficient to establish service connection for that

(1) Any verified full-body exposure to nitrogen or sulfur mustard during active military service together with the
subsequent development of chronic conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal opacities, scar formation, or the following
cancers: nasopharyngeal; laryngeal; lung (except mesothelioma); or, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. 

(2) Any verified full-body exposure to nitrogen or sulfur mustard or Lewisite during active military service together

pulmonary disease. 

(3) Any verified full-body exposure to nitrogen mustard during active military service together with the subsequent
development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. 

(b) Service connection will not be established under this section if the claimed condition is due to the veteran's
own willful misconduct (See 3.301(c)) or there is affirmative evidence that establishes a nonservice-related
supervening condition or event as the cause of the claimed condition (See 303).
