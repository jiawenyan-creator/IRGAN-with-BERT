FT  10 APR 92 / Major reaches out for victory: Lib Dems fail to make headway
MR JOHN MAJOR was on the threshold of an unprecedented fourth consecutive
Conservative term early this morning as the first wave of results from
yesterday's general election suggested he was just within sight of an
overall majority.
With 272 seats declared, the results showed a national swing of 1.64 per
cent to Labour from the Conservatives since 1987, well short of the 4 per
cent swing that Mr Neil Kinnock needed to deprive Mr Major of his majority.
Mr Major, criticised over the past four weeks for a lacklustre campaign, now
appears set to lead his party into the longest continuous period of
government of any party since the Napeolonic wars.
The national picture - a massive disappointment for Mr Kinnock after what
was widely judged a slick and effective Labour campaign - disguised a
stronger performance by his party in many key marginals.
But his second election defeat since taking over as leader of the opposition
in 1983 may now put a questionmark over his future. Mr Kinnock led the major
overhaul of Labour's policies after the 1987 defeat, but his leadership was
judged to be a weakness in the party's campaign.
As the results poured in, Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats appeared to
be losing ground across the country, but in a bad upset for the government,
the centre party defeated Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman,
in Bath.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, shrugged of his party's failure
to make a substantial break-through to attack Labour. 'If they can't beat
this government in the pit of a second recession and in the face of the poll
tax and everything else, you have to ask the question whether they can ever
challenge the government again.'
With large regional disparities in the results, a poor Labour performance in
the recession-hit south-east and a mixed outcome in London was matched by
patchier results in the Midlands and much stronger results in the
north-west.
Computer projections from the BBC and ITN suggested that the most likely
outcome would leave the Conservatives with an overall majority.
On the basis of a Harris exit poll and the first results, ITN forecast that
the Conservatives would win 327 seats, Labour 274, the Liberal Democrats and
others 50. The BBC forecast that Mr Major would hold 328 seats and Mr
Kinnock 274 seats. It gave the Liberal Democrats 21 and others 28.
The actual results - conflicting with initial exit poll projections pointing
to sweeping Conservative losses - brought jubiliation among Conservative
ministers. They claimed that the party's onslaught against Labour's tax and
spending policies and on Mr Kinnock's leadership qualities had brought a
last-minute surge in support for Mr Major.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said that it was clear that his party's
message on tax and the economy had got through. He predicted a warm reaction
from financial markets to the likely outcome.
Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, said: 'We are going to win the
election against all the pundits, if I may say so. Its a good night for the
Conservatives, it is a very good night for John Major - it is his leadership
and the positive way we have fought this campaign that is coming through.'
Apart from their gain in Bath, the Cheltenham from the Conservatives. But Mr
Ashdown failed to make the breakthrough he had hoped for amid signs that
nationwide many of his potential supporters had moved back to the
Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats lost Southport and the Conservatives
held Portsmouth South after two recounts.
Labour seized the Lancashire marginals of Hyndburn and Pendle with swings of
about 5 per cent and secured a swing of more that 7 per cent to win Nuneaton
in the Midlands. But with a swing to Labour of less than 2 per cent in
Basildon, Essex, the Conservatives held one of their most vulnerable seats,
suggesting that Mr Major might still be in sight of a fourth term in office.
The initial exit polls brought Labour claims that Mr Major had suffered the
biggest defeat of any government since 1945 and the prediction that Mr
Kinnock would form the next administration.
But the later results suggested that even if Mr Major fell short of an
overall majority he would be able to form a government with the tacit
support of the Ulster Unionists.
Exit polls also predicted heavy losses for the government in Scotland, with
Mr Major's strident opposition to devolution leaving him with just three or
four seats out of 72, but early results suggested a stronger performance.
The first indications that the Conservatives might be doing better than had
been expected came at Basildon when Mr David Amess, the sitting
Conservative, easily held off a Labour challenge.
Early results also showed Labour recording swings of 1 per cent - far short
of the four per cent needed to produce a hung parliament. But as the night
wore on Labour began registering better figures. The two Lancashire results
and the Nuneaton gain on a 7 per cent swing appeared to support Labour
claims that it was doing better in its target marginals than in either safe
Tory or their own safe seats.
When the first 'big name' results came in there were sharp divergencies. As
widely predicted, Mr Patten fell to the Liberal Democrats at Bath. In
Putney, Mr David Mellor, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, held his seat
with a comfortable majority over Labour.
Some surprises came in Scotland with the Conservatives capturing the
marginal Labour seat of Aberdeen South and neighbouring Kincardine and
Deeside that last year fell to the Liberal Democrats. Mr Michael Forsyth,
the Thatcherite Scottish health and education minister, holding Stirling
despite a strong Labour challenge.
In Glasgow Govan, Mr Jim Sillars, the Scottish National Party's deputy
leader, was defeated by Labour.
The first Liberal Democrat gain came in Cheltenham where Mr Nigel Jones
captured the seat from Mr John Taylor, a black barrister, with a majority of
just over 2,000 votes. Commentators underlined, however, that a race factor
had probably played some impact in the outcome. But elsewhere, their results
were mixed.
Mr Des Wilson, the Liberal Democrat campaign manager, called for Labour and
the Conservatives to accept the verdict of the electorate and work for a
coalition government.
