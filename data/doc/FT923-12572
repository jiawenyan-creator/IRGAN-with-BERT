FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Pilkington shares drop on statement fears
SHARES IN Pilkington, the glass group, fell 11p to 96p yesterday, following
a 6p fall on Wednesday, as stockbrokers anticipated a gloomy statement from
Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman, at next week's annual meeting.
One said: 'We are looking for a grim statement, life is extremely tough for
Pilkington.' The group cut its dividend in June when it reported profits of
Pounds 77m for the year to end-March, after exceptional costs of Pounds 37m,
down from Pounds 151.6m the previous year.
The shares have not been this low since the end of 1985, before BTR bid for
the group in 1986 at a price equivalent to 180.6p. Pilkington's shares have
fallen from a peak this year of 164p in May.
A number of analysts have downgraded forecasts for the company's
current-year results.
