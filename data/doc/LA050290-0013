FINANCIER MICHAEL MILKEN'S PLEADS GUILTY TO 6 FELONIES 
If Charles Dickens were writing "Oliver Twist" today he would likely model his 
character of Fagin on a mixture of Milken, Boesky and several other Wall Street 
manipulators largely consumed by greed. 
It is not enough for Milken to consent to a fine of $600 million, a huge sum by 
any standard but a mere pittance to a man who was reported to have made that 
much in one year. 
The judge in this case has a golden opportunity to prove to us all that crime 
doesn't pay by inducing Milken to barter some of the 28 years of imprisonment 
-- to which he is subject -- for the untold hundreds of millions of dollars 
this man has already salted away. 
The Wall Street manipulators should never be permitted to keep any of their 
ill-gotten gains.
