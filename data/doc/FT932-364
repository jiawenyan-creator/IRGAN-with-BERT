FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Alba bucks recessionary trends with sharp
rise
ALBA continued to buck recessionary trends in the year to March 31. Pre-tax
profits rose 15 per cent from Pounds 5.06m to Pounds 5.84m, though the
audio, television and domestic appliances group pointed out that under FRS 3
accounting standards, the pre-tax increase was 62 per cent to Pounds 5.05m.
Mr John Harris, chairman, said that, in the white and brown goods sector,
the recession had started not as late as 1990 but in 1988. He ascribed the
group's success since then to having 'the right recipe'. 'We know what our
customers really want and at what price point they want it.'
The group's products are sold under three brand-names - Alba, Bush and
Hinari - and frequently by mail order. Mr Harris said that Alba Radio, which
mainly sells audio equipment, had market leadership in major audio (audio
systems which plug into the mains) in both quantity of goods sold and in
value. It also has leadership in 14-inch televisions.
Bush makes slightly more upmarket and larger televisions which Mr Harris
expected to show a sharper sales upturn, now that 'the recovery is in
place'. He added that, in general, the rise in television sales was pleasing
in a year with no sales-boosting events like the Olympics or the World Cup.
Hinari Domestic makes the UK's best-selling toaster and is the fifth largest
seller of microwave ovens, 'ahead of some multi-nationals'.
Group turnover totalled Pounds 113.4m (Pounds 111m), with continuing
operations yielding Pounds 110.2m (Pounds 104.7m). Interest payable fell
sharply to Pounds 467,000 (Pounds 1.15m), because of lower rates and the
reduction of borrowings to Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 11.6m) excluding leases.
The dividend is lifted to 4.85p (4.75p) for the year with a 3.85p (3.75p)
final. Under FRS 3, earnings per share were more than doubled at 8.32p
(3.36p) - otherwise they were up 23 per cent to 9.55p (7.79p).
