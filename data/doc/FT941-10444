FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Anheuser-Busch stable in fourth
term
Anheuser-Busch, the biggest US beer company, yesterday marked the end of a
lacklustre year by reporting net income of Dollars 166.8m for the fourth
quarter, little changed from the Dollars 161.6m reported last time.
For the full year, it reported net income down to Dollars 594.5m from
Dollars 917.5m, but the latest figure included the effects of a pre-tax
restructuring charge of Dollars 565m in the third quarter. If all unusual
charges were stripped out, the company said, the figures would have shown
net income falling to Dollars 980.6m from Dollars 994.2m.
Budweiser, Anheuser-Busch's leading beer brand, has seen declining sales in
recent years.
The group is suffering from widespread price discounting by competing
brewers. But new products such as Budweiser Lite helped maintain market
share at 44.3 per cent of all US beer sales in 1993.
The company said beer sales and volume growth were hit by slow economic
recovery in important selling areas along the US West Coast and aggressive
discounting.
In spite of this, it sold a record 87.3m barrels of beer in 1993, an
increase of 0.5 per cent over the previous year.
Gross sales rose to Dollars 13.19bn from Dollars 13.06bn for the full year.
Earnings per share, fully diluted, fell to Dollars 2.17 from Dollars 3.20,
but Anheuser-Busch said they would have risen to Dollars 3.55 from Dollars
3.46 without the effect of unusual charges.
For the quarter, gross sales rose to Dollars 3.26bn from Dollars 3.12bn
while earnings per share rose to 62 cents from 58 cents. Mr August A. Busch
III, chairman and president, said the company was pleased with the
performance of its premium beer brands in 1993, considering the competitive
conditions in the beer industry.
'Budweiser continues to dominate across all demographic segments. Bud Light
had another excellent year in 1993 with double-digit growth. Bud Light
continues to outpace its major competition, and we believe the brand is well
positioned to become the leading light beer brand in the US.'
