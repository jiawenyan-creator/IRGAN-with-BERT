FT  09 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: UK stores
It does not take much to tickle a fund manager's jaded palate. Some
reasonable retail sales figures, a spurt in the circulation of folding
money, and a whiff of interest rate cuts from across the channel is enough
to have professional investors switching into UK consumer stocks in the hope
of a boost to domestic consumption. Certainly macro-economic forecasts
suggest that consumer spending will rise faster now the ERM has gone. There
are also worries that the capital goods and export earning companies which
have led the market's charge since sterling's exit from the ERM may not look
quite so glamorous once their interim figures arrive in September.
In the short term some stores do hold attractions. Despite tough trading
conditions the big four, Marks and Spencer, Kingfisher, GUS and Boots the
Chemist, seem to be gaining market share from independent retailers and
weaker chains. Those with the muscle to provide competitive pricing and
value are gaining sales without damaging margins. That squeezes those chains
which are stuck with a cycle of seasonal sales to shift stock which will not
sell at full margins.
Further out, however, there are worries. The November Budget can only
depress consumer confidence, even if some of the more aggressive tax
increases are avoided. Consumer perceptions of value will continue to limit
the ability to increase margins and the threat of discount formats remains
on the horizon. The advocates of Everyday Low Pricing may have the right
tactics for the market, but it is hardly a way to get rich quick.
