MOUNTAIN CYCLISTS DEFEND SAFETY RECORD 
In Jeff Meyers' otherwise fine article on Sycamore Canyon on July 7, he claims 
that hikers are gravely threatened by mountain bicyclists who have no regard 
for safety. This characterization and the quote from Ranger Brit Horn asserting 
that there have been accidents and lawsuits involving bicyclists are the only 
mention of bicyclists in the article. This is a one-sided view of mountain bike 
use. 
It is worth noting that bicyclists are legitimate users of fire roads in 
Sycamore Canyon; that the vast majority of bicyclists ride carefully with high 
regard for the safety of other users; that CORBA's (Concerned Off-Road 
Bicyclists Assn.) volunteer Mountain Bike Patrol works closely with the state 
parks to monitor and regulate bicycle use in Sycamore Canyon; and that, to our 
knowledge, there are no lawsuits involving "bikes running into and over people 
in the hills." 
Mountain bicycling, like hiking, allows one to experience the wonder and the 
beauty of the backcountry. Bicycles are human scale, have negligible 
environmental impact, and can be ridden safely and responsibly in multi-user 
settings like Sycamore. My group, the Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Assn., has 
been working hard to educate all backcountry users in the appropriate use of 
bicycles, and these efforts have often received positive coverage in The Times. 
Meyers' focus on the negative case is frustrating. 
Mountain bicycle use in the state parks has raised some difficult recreational 
conflict issues, and unfounded claims and sweeping generalizations are 
particularly troublesome in this point in time as the state parks formulate new 
policy. To characterize all bicyclists by the few who ride irresponsibly is 
like characterizing all hikers by the few who smoke cigarettes on Sycamore's 
tinder-dry trails. In both cases, reckless and dangerous behavior threatens all 
users; in both cases, education and enforcement are the solution to this 
problem; and in both cases, this behavior should not reflect on the large 
numbers of responsible users.
