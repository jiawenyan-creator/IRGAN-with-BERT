  [Text] The State Duma members will spend this week in their 
constituencies while chairmen of parliamentary committees will 
recruit staff, obtain premises and install telephones, computers 
and faxes in them. 
  In particular, the Security Committee has no premises or 
telephone number, its Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin told Interfax. 
  The Legislation Committee has to draft a plan of legislative 
activities for the Duma and will have no recess. 
  Vladimir Isakov, its chairman, told Interfax Monday that the 
State Duma deputies had significantly amended the plan that had 
been submitted by the legislative commission of the president's 
office and the two plans had to be reconciled. 
  The Information Politics and Communication Committee chaired 
by Mikhail Poltoranin has to report on the state-controlled mass 
media, in particular television coverage of parliament 
activities. 
  Numerous deputies, notably the liberal democratic group, 
think that the Parliamentary Hour TV program has to be resumed 
under the title of The Federal Assembly Hour. Poltoranin 
himself believes that the equal representation of all branches 
of authorities can be achieved by a law now being drafted by the 
legislative commission of the president's office.
