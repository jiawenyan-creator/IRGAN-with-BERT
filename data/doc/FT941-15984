FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: PSIT advances 38% to Pounds 5.38m at midway
PSIT, the property investor formerly known as Property Security Investment
Trust, yesterday announced a 38 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 5.38m for the six months to end-September.
The company said that its main investment activities progressed
satisfactorily. 'Values have improved as the yield on property compares more
favourably with other forms of investment and there are now signs of
increasing rental enquiries,' it said.
Part of the company's land in Florida, which was required for a new highway,
was compulsorily acquired which would help release the full potential of the
site. The extension to the District shopping centre in Australia had been
formally opened and was now making a good contribution to income.
Total rents increased from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 10.1m, while interest costs
fell from Pounds 5.27m to Pounds 4.56m.
Earnings per share rose from 2.13p to 2.99p. The interim dividend goes up
from 1.5p to 1.75p.
