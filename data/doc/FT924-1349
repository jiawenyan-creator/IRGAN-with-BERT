FT  18 DEC 92 / Major and Delors in row over HDTV plan
MR JOHN MAJOR was last night embroiled in an extraordinary row with Mr
Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, over Britain's decision
to veto an Ecu500m (Pounds 405m) European Community programme to fund high
definition television.
The row, which broke out as both men travelled on the same aircraft to North
America for the EC-Canada and the EC-US summits, centred on allegations that
Mr Major had reneged on an agreement at last week's Edinburgh summit to
support the HDTV programme. It threatened to sour their joint meetings later
today with outgoing US president George Bush.
Mr Delors said the British veto on the project, a prime element in the
Community's research and development effort, should be lifted at a meeting
next Monday of EC foreign ministers.
Confirming the contents of a private letter he had sent to the British prime
minister, Mr Delors said Mr Major had broken the terms of an Edinburgh
agreement. At that meeting, Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, is
said to have made his agreement to a deal on the siting of EC institutions
conditional on approval of HDTV programmes.
Mr Delors said: 'My understanding is that Mr Major gave his agreement.'
Senior British officials said Mr Major had explicitly stated his objectives
in Edinburgh and had given no undertakings to Mr Lubbers. They contradicted
Mr Delors, who sat only a few feet away, saying the record of the summit -
held on tape - backed Mr Major's version. Britain judged the HDTV technology
the Commission wanted to develop was 'outdated'. HDTV represents the next
generation of television technology and is expected to enhance picture
quality.
Earlier, Mr Delors said he had made a 'careful note' of proceedings in
Edinburgh. He said it was 'his duty' to see the agreement was implemented.
