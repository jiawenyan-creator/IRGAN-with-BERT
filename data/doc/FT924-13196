FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: American Air plans heavy cuts
AMERICAN Airlines, one the big three US carriers, yesterday announced it
would dismiss hundreds of administrative workers in an attempt to cut
management payroll costs by 10 per cent next year.
American's move is further evidence of the continuing financial pressures on
the US airline industry generally - which has clocked up losses of around
Dollars 7bn during the past two-and-a-half years.
Like its two big competitors, United and Delta, American has already
announced multi-billion dollar cuts in capital spending plans for the next
few years.
American, based in Dallas, said the latest jobs losses came as part of
broader effort to prune Dollars 300m from 1993 expenditures.
It had not determined the precise number of jobs that would disappear, but
calculated that the figure would range between 500 and 1,000.
Although cuts would be made across the system, the airline acknowledged the
bulk of the job losses would occur in the Texas headquarters.
AMR, American's parent, has not yet reported third-quarter results, but it
has warned that it expected a loss.
In the first six months of the year, AMR has lost Dollars 146m after-tax.
Its shares closed up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 58 1/4 yesterday.
