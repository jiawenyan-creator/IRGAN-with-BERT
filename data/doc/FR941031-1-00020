 

This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and 
is type certificated for operation in the United States 
under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable 
bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this 
bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada has 
kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. 
Based on its aging commuter-class aircraft policy 
and after reviewing all available information including 
that received from Transport Canada, the FAA has 
determined that AD action should be taken to eventually 
eliminate the repetitive short-interval inspections 
required by AD 831803, and to prevent tailplane 
failure caused by cracks in either the outboard hinge 
arm or the hinge plate. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
is likely to exist or develop in other de Havilland DHC6 series airplanes of the same type design, the 
proposed AD would supersede AD 831803 with a new AD 
that would (1) initially retain the requirement of 
repetitively inspecting the tailplane outboard hinge 
assembly for cracks, and replacing any cracked part; 
and (2) eventually require modifying the tailplane 
outboard hinge arm and tailplane hinge plate with parts 
of improved design (Modification No. 1799) as 
terminating action for the currently required 
repetitive inspections. The proposed actions would be 
accomplished in accordance with de Havilland SB No. 
6/421, Revision B, dated November 11, 1983. 
The FAA estimates that 141 airplanes in the U.S. 
registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it 
would take approximately 35 workhours per airplane to 
accomplish the proposed action, and that the average 
labor rate is approximately $60 an hour. Parts cost 
approximately $4,400 per airplane. Based on these 
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on 
U.S. operators is estimated to be $916,500. This 
figure is based on the assumption that no affected 
airplane owner/operator has accomplished the proposed 
action. 
The intent of the FAA's aging commuter airplane 
program is to ensure safe operation of commuter-class 
airplanes that are in commercial service without 
adversely impacting private operators. Of the 
approximately 141 airplanes in the U.S. registry that 
would be affected by the proposed AD, the FAA has 
determined that approximately 40 percent are operated 
in scheduled passenger service. A significant number 
of the remaining 60 percent are operated in other forms 
of air transportation such as air cargo and air taxi. 
The proposed AD allows 2,400 hours time-in-service 
(TIS) before mandatory accomplishment of the design 
modification. The average utilization of the fleet for 
those airplanes in commercial commuter service is 
approximately 25 to 50 hours TIS per week. Based on 
these figures, operators of commuter-class airplanes 
involved in commercial operation would have to 
accomplish the proposed modification within 12 to 24 
calendar months after the proposed AD would become 
effective. For private owners, who typically operate 
between 100 to 200 hours TIS per year, this would allow 
12 to 24 years before the proposed modification would 
be mandatory. 
The following paragraphs present cost scenarios 
for airplanes where no cracks are found and where 
cracks are found, utilizing an average remaining 
airplane life of 15 years and an average annual 
utilization rate of 1,600 hours TIS. A copy of the 
full Cost Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility 
Determination for the proposed action may be 
examined at the FAA, Central Region, Office of the 
Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 
91CE46AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas 
City, Missouri. 
&bull;No Cracks Scenario: Under the provisions of AD 
831803, an owner/operator of a de Havilland DHC6 
series airplane in scheduled service who operates an 
average of 1,600 hours TIS annually would inspect every 
1,200 hours TIS. This would amount to a remaining 
airplane life (estimated 15 years) amount of $4,769; 
this figure is based on the assumption that no cracks 
are found during the inspections. The proposed AD 
would incur the same 1,200-hour TIS inspection until 
2,400 hours TIS where the operator would have to 
replace the tailplane outboard hinge arm assembly 
(eliminating the need for further repetitive 
inspections), which would result in a present value 
cost of $6,574. The incremental cost of the proposed 
AD for such an airplane would be $1,805 ($6,574^$4,769) or $1,309 annualized over the 1.5 years it 
would take to accumulate 2,400 hours TIS. An owner of 
a general aviation airplane who operates 800 hours TIS 
annually without finding any cracks during the 1,200-hour TIS inspections would incur a present value 
incremental cost of $3,843 ($5,990^$2,507). This 
would amount to a per year amount of $1,327 over the 
three years it would take to accumulate 2,400 hours 
TIS. 
&bull;Cracks Found Scenario: Under the provisions of 
AD 831803, an owner/operator of a de Havilland DHC6 
series airplane who found cracks during an inspection 
would have to repair the crack prior to further flight 
and resume inspections every 1,200 hours TIS. The 
proposed AD would require immediate replacement of the 
arm assembly if cracks were found as terminating action 
for the repetitive inspection requirement. The repair 
cost is the same as the replacement except that the 
repair does not terminate the inspection requirement. 
For this reason, the proposed AD would result in 
present-day cost savings, which would continue to grow 
over the remaining life of the airplane since 
repetitive inspections would not be required. Using 
the assumed 15-year remaining life, the cost savings 
would be $4,409 for scheduled service airplane 
owners/operators and $2,149 for general aviation 
airplane owners/operators.
