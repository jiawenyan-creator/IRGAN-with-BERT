  [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- A symposium in the 
domain of railways took place to mark the lapse of 30 years 
since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il began to work at the 
Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. 
  Speakers at the symposium noted that the dear leader 
regarded 
railway transport as a leading sector to which definite 
precedence over other branches of the national economy must be 
given and has led them to effect a signal change in their work. 
  They said an important feat performed by the dear leader in 
directing the work of railway transportation is that he defined 
"the drive for extra haulage on schedule without accident to 
implement the decision of the 18th plenary meeting of the 5th 
Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea" as a mass 
movement of loyalty which the railway workers should hold fast 
to and conduct vigorously, and led them to register brilliant 
successes in this movement. 
  Now, the railway transport domain, they said, has assumed 
its 
looks wonderfully as a pioneer of the national economy and is 
playing a big part in the transport of materials conducive to 
socialist economic construction.
