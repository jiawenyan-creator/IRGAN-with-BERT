  [Text] Prague, April 25 (CTK) -- The problem of quality 
certification for food stuffs required at the Slovak-Czech 
border will be debated in Tuesday's [26 April] session of the 
Slovak Government, Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik told Czech 
Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy today. 
  Moravcik telephoned Dlouhy after no progress was made on 
this 
issue in today's session of Customs Union representatives at the 
deputy ministerial level, a ministry spokesman announced. 
  Chairman of the Czech Office of Standardization, Measures, 
and State Testing Michal Tosovsky told CTK last Thursday [21 
April] that problems could arise at the border with Slovakia 
because from May 1 Slovakia was again to recognize only its own 
food quality certificates. Czech certificates are considered 
unacceptable by the Slovak customs authorities. 
  The Customs Union decided at its last session to work out an 
agreement, to be approved by both parliaments, that would allow 
each country to recognize each other's certificates. On 
Thursday Slovakia announced, however, that it would be 
impossible to get an agreement on the issue approved in the 
Slovak Parliament before the September elections.
