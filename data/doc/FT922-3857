FT  09 JUN 92 / Kenyans register for elections
Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi led thousands of Kenyans registering as
voters for multi-party elections yesterday despite opposition calls for a
boycott, Reuter reports from Nairobi.
Mr Moi said election officials would 'ensure that the polls would be
conducted freely and fairly.'
The main opposition Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) called on
Kenyans not to register until an independent all-party electoral commission
had been formed.
The government said the registration of about 10m voters would take 30 days.
Mr Moi has yet to announce an election date, but according to the
constitution, they must be held before next March when the term of the
present parliament ends.
