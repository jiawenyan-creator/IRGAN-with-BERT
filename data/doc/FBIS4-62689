  [Text] Baku, May 17 (TURAN) -- "The agreement which was 
signed yesterday by the Defense Ministers of Azerbaijan and 
Armenia as well as the Commandant of Nagorno-Karabakh in Moscow 
threatens Azerbaijan's independence", the Deputy Chairman of the 
Popular Front, Asim Mollazadeh, told TURAN's correspondent. 
Mollazade said that the stationing of Russian troops will mean 
the restoration of Moscow's military control over Azerbaijan. 
The second danger is that the United Nations and the CSCE will 
be out of the game concerning the settlement of the conflict. 
  The leader of National Independence Party, Etibar Mamedov, 
said that "it is impossible to call troops of another state to 
Azerbaijan without permission from the Parliament. We will 
oppose the return of the Russian empire to Azerbaijan". 
  "The Defense Minister has no right to sign a document 
concerning the deployment of troops of another state in the 
country since it is among his duties. That is why I think that 
this agreement has no legal force", the leader of Musavat Party, 
Isa Gambar, told TURAN. State Advisor, Gabil Guseinli, speaking 
with a correspondent from AZADLIG said that "we are speaking 
about CSCE observers with an additional military contingent and 
not about Russian troops. Moreover, that extra contingent will 
submit itself to the CSCE observers".
