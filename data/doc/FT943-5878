FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Television Broadcasts reports
profit up 70%
Television Broadcasts, Hong Kong's premier television company, yesterday
surprised the stock market when it reported a 70 per cent increase in
first-half net earnings to HKDollars 278m (USDollars 36m) from HKDollars
163.5m.
The higher-than-expected profits at TVB were struck on turnover up nearly 36
per cent to HKDollars 1.18bn from HKDollars 871m in the previous half.
Earnings per share of 66 cents were nearly 70 per cent up on last year.
The company said it had experienced strong growth in demand for advertising
airtime and cited advertising directed at property investment in China as
one of the main forces behind this.
TVB is seen as one of the strongest media companies in Asia. Recently
Pearson, the UK group which publishes the Financial Times, entered
negotiations to acquire 10 per cent of TVB. These talks have since stalled.
Mr Lau Siu-chuen, media analyst at Morgan Stanley, said there were a number
of special factors which helped boost profits in the first half compared
with a year earlier.
The most important of these was a change in the Hong Kong government's
advertising royalties. A year ago the government took 12 per cent of TVB's
advertising revenues but now takes 10 per cent. TVB, as with all other Hong
Kong companies, has also benefited from a 1 percentage point cut in the
corporate rate.
Directors declared an interim dividend of 20 cents a share, up 33 per cent
on the corresponding period last year.
