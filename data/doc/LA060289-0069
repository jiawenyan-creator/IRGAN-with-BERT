THE WORLD 
Cypriot unity remains a dream now that a June 1 target date set by the United 
Nations for progress in reunification talks between the Greek and Turkish 
Cypriot communities has passed, officials said. A Greek Cypriot politician said 
the only tangible outcome of 10 months of U.N.-sponsored negotiations was an 
agreement to withdraw troops from sensitive areas in the heart of Nicosia, the 
capital. The head of the Greek Cypriot community, President George Vassiliou, 
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash are due to meet U.N. Secretary General 
Javier Perez de Cuellar in New York at the end of this month.
