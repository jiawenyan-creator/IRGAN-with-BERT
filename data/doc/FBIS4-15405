<F P=106> [Eduard Gonzalez report: "Another Trial Behind Us. </F>
Izvestiya Publishing House Case Against Russian Government Over"] 
  [Text] It will soon be a year that representatives of the 
Izvestiya Publishing House have been paying occasional visits to 
the Russian Federation Supreme Court of Arbitration. Its 
ruling, as we have already reported, is now legally valid -- 
regarding the lawfulness of the founding of the "IZVESTIYA 
Editorial Office" Joint-Stock Company. However the publishing 
house filed new charges -- this time against the Russian 
Government. Why, they say, did it give the order for the 
joint-stock company to be privatized? 
  Although this question has been discussed on two occasions 
as 
part of the case and two legal bodies have adopted a ruling, a 
court comprising A. Kozlova, T. Yegorova, and I. Podyachev was 
forced to consider it separately. There is nothing you can do 
about it -- that is the plaintiff's procedural right. 
  The interests of the Russian Government were represented by 
P. Mostova, first deputy chairman of the Russian State Committee 
for the Management of State Property, and lawyer B. Maksimov. 
The editorial office's interests were defended by A. 
Rakhmilovich, member of the Moscow City Collegium of Attorneys. 
  The court produced its ruling -- that the proceedings be 
dismissed. The reasons have not yet been given and we do not 
know what they will reveal. But we can guess what the judges 
will quite understandably not say. Namely, only in our 
upside-down back-to-front world can someone who uses state 
property file charges against the owner -- the country's 
government. And the owner has to justify himself instead of 
asking: How do you use state property? 
  Were the owner to ask that question a host of trials would 
sweep across Russia. And not of course in courts of 
arbitration. However, these subjective impressions have nothing 
to do with the trial and its ruling.
