  [Excerpt] Rome -- Another day, umpteenth opinion poll, new 
result. This time it is Directa's turn, which, for the 
proportional vote, sees a tight victory for the PDS [Democratic 
Party of the Left] (21.2 percent) over Forza Italia (20.8 
percent), which is in a downward trend. 
  The researchers observe a slight revival for the Northern 
League (10.3 percent), whereas the Italian Popular Party [PPI] 
with 11.2 percent, the Pact for Italy with 6.2 percent, and the 
National Alliance with 9.8 percent remain more or less stable. 
The Greens (5 percent) and the Communist Renewal (4.8 percent) 
pass the 4 percent threshold. Thus, the ecologists are 
boasting: "In the battle of the opinion polls, which are very 
instrumental and hardly scientific, there finally are some data 
rendering the truth." On the other hand, the Democratic 
Alliance (3.4 percent), Rete (3.3 percent), and the Pannella 
list (2.2 percent) remain under the threshold which allows entry 
into parliament. 
  According to Directa, these results "can still change 
dramatically given the effects of the election campaign on the 
undecided voters." The percentage of undecided voters decreased 
from 60.4 to 36.4, which, 18 days from the elections, is still a 
very high figure. 
  Directa interviewed by telephone 1,527 voters scattered over 
85 small, medium-sized, and large communities, covering a sample 
representative of gender and age, divided along four 
geographical areas and four sizes of city towns. The 
interviewees were asked: "In the proportional election scheme 
for the Chamber of Deputies, you will vote for a party and not 
for a candidate; for which party have you decided to vote?" A 
total of 971 of the interviewees, i.e., 63.6 percent, replied.
