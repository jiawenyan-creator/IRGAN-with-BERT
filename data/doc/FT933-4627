FT  08 SEP 93 / Doors slam shut in salesman's face: Increasing bancassurance
sales are at the expense of UK insurance companies
It is the kind of divorce that makes headlines. The Halifax, Britain's
largest building society, last week announced it would sever its ties with
one of the UK's largest insurance companies, Standard Life.
Citing irreconcilable strategic differences, Halifax said it would form its
own life insurance company next year, whose products would be sold
exclusively in its own outlets. The move is a blow to Standard Life, which
totted up nearly a fifth of all its UK sales through the Halifax last year.
Standard Life thus becomes the latest - and largest - casualty of a trend
which has seen the main life insurance companies frozen out of the
high-street retail branches that helped them sell their products most
cheaply.
Banks and building societies are eschewing the role of commissioned sales
agent for leading insurers, and choosing to set up their own life companies.
The development comes when, by all accounts, there is already far too much
capacity in the industry and observers are predicting a shake-out.
Mr Tom King, general manager in charge of marketing at Standard Life, said:
'I don't think the marketplace is big enough to hold all those companies
which are out there.'
But the banks are not concerned about overcrowding in the market. Mr Michael
Wadsworth, partner in the insurance practice at consulting actuaries R
Watson and Co, estimates that the average insurance sales agent based at a
bank or building society sells four to six times as many policies a month as
the average sales agent who solicits business from customers in their homes
or by telephone.
As a result, bancassurance - insurance products sold through banks and
building societies - is a cheaper sales method than the traditional route.
By the end of the decade, Mr Wadsworth forecasts, bancassurance will account
for 30 to 50 per cent of the UK retail financial services market.
Banks have long been aware of their potential as insurance distributors. Mr
Brian Pitman, chief executive at Lloyds Bank, recalled that in the 1950s
Lloyds allowed branch managers to broker independent financial advice,
pocketing the commissions they earned on each sale. 'Some of them made more
money as insurance brokers than they did as branch managers,' said Mr
Pitman.
Lloyds Bank stopped the sales in the 1960s, but compensated its managers for
the sums they earned selling insurance. The episode illustrates the
potential of banks and building societies to act as the natural marketplace
for retail financial products.
The current growth of bancassurance has its roots not only in commercial
considerations but also in the regulatory framework governing UK financial
services. The Financial Services Act, which took effect in 1988, led to
'polarisation'. Sales agents had either to 'tie' themselves to one company
by selling its products exclusively or remain 'independent' by selling the
best products from all providers.
Most banks and building societies realised that customers did not always
recognise the difference between independent and tied advice. Tying
themselves to one company earned the banks and societies more money, because
insurance companies pay higher commissions to those selling their products
exclusively.
It was only a short step for them to decide that having their own insurance
operations and selling their own products was most profitable of all.
Mr Pitman of Lloyds said: 'Our market research showed that, if we sold our
own products, our customers would buy them. And our analysis showed that
underwriting would be more profitable than broking.' Lloyds entered the
business by taking a 60 per cent stake in Abbey Life in 1988, an operation
that earned it more than a third of its profits last year.
Similarly, National and Provincial Building Society, which recently
announced plans to combine with the Leeds to form Britain's third-largest
society, earned 25 per cent of 1992 profits from the sale of its own retail
financial services.
But some seeds of doubt about the virtues of bancassurance have been sown,
partly by new Treasury rules allowing prospective policyholders to learn
more about the costs of insurance products. Buyers, for instance, will have
to be told in cash terms how much the sales agent will earn on a policy as
commission and how much of the premium payments will be withheld by the
insurance company if the policy is cashed in early.
For long-term policies, consumers can lose up to the first two years of
premium payments in administration charges and commission, and may have to
pay premiums for 10 to 12 years to earn a full refund of all premiums paid
on a 25-year endowment policy. Under the new rules, such information will
have to be revealed to those shopping for a policy, from next year.
'Mr and Mrs Homebuyer will fall off their chairs when they see those
numbers,' said Mr Roman Cizden, life insurance industry analyst at the
stockbroker Smith NewCourt.
Bank and building society outlets have been most successful in selling
endowment policies, because they also sold the mortgage that went with it.
Homebuyers have been convinced that an endowment was the best option - even
though it often led to higher monthly repayments without tax relief and to
heavy penalties for early encashment. By 1991, some 80 per cent of all
mortgages sold in the UK had an endowment policy attached.
Questions about the bancassurance strategy have been raised by one of
Britain's largest building societies, which has severed its tie with a
leading insurance company, saying it did not believe the insurer's staple
product - endowment mortgages - was necessarily in its customers' best
interests.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of Cheltenham and Gloucester Building
Society, Britain's sixth largest, announced last month that the society
would not renew its five-year contract with Legal and General Assurance
Society, under which C&amp;G agreed to sell L&amp;G insurance products exclusively.
C&amp;G decided to abandon retail financial products and concentrate on the sale
of so-called interest-only and repayment mortgages, which are sold without
the ancillary endowment insurance policy.
Industry observers point out that endowment policies have often been the
principal product in a bancassurer's sales strategy. If the new transparency
rules cause buyers to lose their taste for endowment mortgages, what will
happen to the bancassurance approach?
Mr Wadsworth noted that bancassurers had been most successful with
relatively simple endowments, unit trusts or lump-sum investment bonds. They
had achieved less success at penetrating the growing market for personal
pensions, which is more complex and which requires more sophisticated
training of salespeople.
Industry statistics, produced by the Association of British Insurers, bear
this out. While banks and building societies sold 21 per cent of unit-linked
insurance policies in the UK in the first quarter of this year, they sold 5
per cent of annual premium pension products.
Mr David Prosser, chief executive of Legal and General, argued that, while
some bancassurers would succeed, they could not satisfy customers over the
long term. 'What the average consumer wants is someone to talk to about
their problems and who will be around in five years to answer their
questions.'
Insurers are putting a brave face on the erosion of their distribution
channels, and say they can make up lost sales by cultivating their personal
relationships with customers and selling them a range of products over their
lifetime. But the wave of mergers and acquisitions of small to medium-sized
insurance companies is testament to the strength of the bancassurers and the
inroads they have already made into the market.
