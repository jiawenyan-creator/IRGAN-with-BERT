  [Text] Army spokeswoman Major Berta Vargas de Marroquin 
blamed URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] guerrillas 
for the recent terrorist actions because it was URNG members who 
planted the powerful bombs on electricity pylons located 
throughout Guatemala City at 2100. She pointed out that these 
bombs caused blackouts and left people without lights. 
  Vargas de Marroquin noted that, by perpetrating these 
criminal actions, URNG members endanger the physical safety of 
the population, destroy the country's infrastructure, hurt 
private citizens by depriving them of indispensable electrical 
power, and cause considerable financial losses to the industrial 
sector and the population in general.
