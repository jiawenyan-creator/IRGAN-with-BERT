FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Cut-rate paper for Efim's
creditors
CREDITORS of Efim, the Italian state holding company which went into
voluntary liquidation last month, are to be issued bonds paying interest at
only about half current market rates, the Italian au-thorities announced
yesterday.
Although they will receive back the full value of their loans when the bonds
mature after five years, Italy's unilateral decision to first freeze
payments and then cut the interest rate has already angered the country's
foreign bank creditors.
The difference in interest rates between those on the bonds and current
market levels means creditors will receive only about 80 per cent of the
total principal and interest that would otherwise have been due.
Mr Piero Barucci, Italy's treasury minister, noted that after allowing for
reclaimed tax, the figure would be about 90 per cent. Mr Barucci stressed
that the difference would decrease should market interest rates fall during
the life of the new bonds.
Under the terms for the new paper, announced last month but only revealed in
detail yesterday, creditors will be given paper, denominated in either lira
or ecu. The coupon on the lira bonds will be 7.25 per cent, while that for
the ecu will be 4 per cent.
The details received a hostile reception from foreign banks. The decision to
offer paper in more than one currency and to pay interest retrospectively
from July 18, when Efim was wound up, was appreciated, but bankers reacted
angrily to the coupon levels.
The details came in a government decree, replacing original legislation
which put Efim into voluntary liquidation and froze its debt. Under the
changes, Efim subsidiaries which are trading profitably will be able to
resume payments to creditors.
Efim, with debts of L8,500bn (Dollars 7.66m), owes about L3,500bn to foreign
banks.
