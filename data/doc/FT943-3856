FT  12 SEP 94 / International Company News: New emerging markets trust being
launched
In an important expansion of investment opportunities in the move into
global emerging markets, Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull is launching an
investment trust aimed at expected capital growth in information
infrastructure in emerging economies in Asia, Europe and Latin America.
BZW Investment Management will manage the fund, to be named The
Infostructure Trust, which is initially aimed at a minimum total investment
of about Pounds 40m although this figure is likely to become very much
greater, depending on the response to the offer.
The fund will hold shares, mostly in companies quoted on emerging stock
markets and which operate across the full range of the information industry,
including advertising, publishing and telecommunications, newspapers, and
education, as well as electronic software and hardware.
The issue, in the form of an institutional placing and public offering of
ordinary shares with warrants attached, will be sterling dominated and
listed in London.
Trading in the shares is expected to start in November.
