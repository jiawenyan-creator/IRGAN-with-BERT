<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of the Navy is amending its certifications and exemptions under the International Regulations for
Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), to reflect that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy has determined
that USS WASP (LHD 1) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot comply fully
with certain provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with its special functions as a naval amphibious assault
ship. The intended effect of this rule is to warn mariners in waters where 72 COLREGS apply.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the authority granted in 33 U.S.C. 1605, the Department of the Navy amends 32 CFR Part 706. This amendment
provides notice that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Navy,
has certified that USS WASP (LHD 1) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot
comply fully with 72 COLREGS: Annex I, section 3(a), pertaining to the location of the forward masthead light in the
forward quarter of the ship, and the horizontal distance between the forward and after masthead lights; and Annex
I, section 2(g), pertaining to the positioning of the sidelights above the hull, without interfering with its special
function as an amphibious assault ship. The Judge Advocate General of the Navy has also certified that the aforementioned
lights are located in closest possible compliance with the applicable 72 COLREGS requirements. 


Moreover, it has been determined, in accordance with 32 CFR Parts 296 and 701, that publication of this amendment for
public comment prior to adoption is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest since it is based
on technical findings that the placement of lights on this vessel in a manner differently from that prescribed herein
will adversely affect the vessel's ability to perform its military functions.
