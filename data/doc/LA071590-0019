FOR SOME READERS, TIFFANY IS NO JETSON 
Two months ago a producer-type sat me down and told me that what my movie (a 
musical) needed, in order to sell big, was Tiffany. 
He said I should dump the actress I had and think "soundtrack album deal" 
instead. 
That kind of individual is not concerned with entertaining and enlightening an 
audience with a good movie but whether the neon-colored marketing campaign is 
in place before anyone has written a script! 
As one entertainment attorney droned on to me during a recent meeting, "All 
they want is Tom Cruise in a race car." If this is becoming the norm, then this 
business is headed for serious trouble.
