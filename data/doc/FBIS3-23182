  [Text] A group of terrorists fired on Sirnak's Cizre 
District with rocket launchers and long-barreled weapons last 
night. Our correspondent has learned that the shooting began at 
2015 and lasted until 2300. Murat Orumcek, a policeman, was 
martyred, and another policeman was wounded. Some buildings 
were damaged. 
  Meanwhile, terrorists attacked the BOTAS [Pipeline and 
Petroleum Transport Corporation] oil pipeline between Cizre and 
Idil. A fire erupted in the pipeline. Search operations are 
underway in the area. 
  We have just received a report that Hincal Uluc, a 
correspondent with the daily SABAH, was walking in Levent in 
Istanbul when shots were fired at him at around 0930 from a 
passing car with the license plate 34 U 3115. Uluc was wounded 
in the foot and taken to a private hospital in Levent. An 
investigation is underway.
