CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE BEST COMICS OF THE DECADE SELECTED BY THE EDITORS OF 
THE COMICS JOURNAL (FANTAGRAPHICS BOOKS: $12.95) 
The first installment in a projected two-volume set, "Comics of the Decade" 
examines the graphic work being done outside the mainstream newspaper strips 
and comic books, stressing original approaches to storytelling and imaginative 
visual styles. Bill Griffith ("Zippy the Pinhead") offers a slyly satirical 
self-portrait of an artist torn between the conflicting claims of aesthetic 
purity and commercial gain. 
Matt Groening and Jules Feiffer provide delightfully acerbic commentaries on 
the follies of contemporary American politics and culture. However, not all the 
work in this anthology attains that level of excellence: Howard Cruse's rather 
heavy-handed portrait of a repressed clergyman lacks the insouciant charm of 
his "Wendel" series; John Callahan's cartoons about alcoholism seem merely 
crude. "Best Comics" proves that the comics needn't be restricted to the 
homogenized humor of "Garfield" and "Hagar the Horrible".
