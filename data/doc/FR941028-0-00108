 


State Primacy





NCA/AMC argue that the proposed OSM and OHA regulations ``undermine state primacy [under section 503 of SMCRA, 30
U.S.C. (1988)] entirely, by preempting state permitting authority where the ownership and control presumption
is based on information contained within the AVS. *** Additionally, OSM and OHA propose to require
that any appeals from decisions on the ownership and control presumptions be made before the OHA in accordance with
the proposed OHA regulations at 43 CFR 4.1380. *** Moreover, OSM would create a completely federalized
process for administrative review of the AVS linkage.''



The regulatory authority in a state that has been delegated primacy under section 503 will retain its authority to
issue permits. Information in the AVS is ``other information available to the regulatory authority,'' within the
meaning of section 510(c), that a state regulatory authority must use in deciding whether or not issuance of a permit
should be blocked. The state regulatory authority's decision is its own_subject, of course, to OSM oversight. See
30 U.S.C. 1202(g), 1211(c), 1253, 1254, 1255, and 1271.



An applicant or other person shown in the AVS in an ownership or control link to any person cited in a state violation
notice may challenge the status of the violation in that notice under the state program equivalents to proposed 30
CFR 773.24(b)(d) and 773.26. See proposed 30 CFR 773.24(a)(3), 56 FR 45800 (Sept. 6, 1991). Similarly, decisions
by a state regulatory authority to suspend or rescind a permit are reviewed by the State program equivalent of proposed
43 CFR 4.13704.1377. See proposed 30 CFR 773.20(c)(2), 56 FR 45799 (Sept. 6, 1991). The fact that challenges
to ownerships and control links and to the status of violations are made to OSM by applicants or other persons shown
in the AVS under proposed 30 CFR 773.24(a)(1) and (a)(2), and that OSM's decisions are reviewed under proposed 43 CFR
4.13804.1387, is a function of OSM's maintenance of the data in AVS and its responsibility to keep that data
accurate and up-to-date. But OSM's role in deciding on the accuracy of the data and OHA's role in reviewing those decisions
do not subvert the authority of the state regulatory authority in a primacy state to make decisions on applications
for permits.




Burden of Proof





NCA/AMC object to OHA's proposed 43 CFR 4.1374(b) and 4.1384(b), which place the ultimate burden of persuasion on
a permittee that seeks review of a notice of proposed suspension or rescission and on an applicant or other persons
that seeks review of an OSM decision on a challenge to an ownership and control link or status of a violation shown in
the AVS. In proposed 4.1374(a) and 4.1384(a), OSM has the burden of going forward to present a prima facie
case of the validity of the notice or decision. NCA/AMC state that when OSM seeks to overturn a permit as improvidently
issued, it should bear the ultimate burden of proving its case. ``All permits, once issued, should be accorded some
presumption that they were issued in accordance and compliance with applicable law. *** [I]t is the
party seeking to set aside the permitting decision who should bear both the burden of going forward to establish a prima
facie case and the ultimate burden of persuasion, ``NCA/AMC state.



Allocation of the burdens of proof in proposed 43 CFR 4.1374 and 4.1384 is consistent with other OHA regulations governing
review of OSM decisions. See 43 CFR 4.1171, 4.1193, 4.1366. OSM's burden of going forward to support a prima facie case
of the validity of its notice or decision means it must present ``sufficient evidence *** to establish
the essential facts *** which evidence will remain sufficient if not contradicted. It is evidence
that will justify but not compel a finding in favor of the one presenting it.''

will have access to information that would overcome OSM's prima facie case.

 OSM,

burden of going forward with proof, not the ultimate burden of persuasion.

Right of Appeals From OSM Decisions for Adversely Affected Persons; Notice of Appeals to Adversely Affected Persons




The NWF comments criticized proposed 43 CFR 4.1371 for its failure to incorporate the rights of citizens to challenge
decisions by OSM regarding improvidently issued permits under 30 CFR 773.20. As explained above, 30 CFR 773.20 provides
that a permit has been improvidently issued if, under the violations review criteria at the time the permit was issued,
the regulatory authority should not have issued the permit. Proposed 43 CFR 4.1371 grants a right of review to a ``permittee
that is served with a notice of suspension under 30 CFR 773.20(c)(2) or a notice of proposed suspension and rescission
under 30 CFR 773.21.'' The rights of citizens to appeal similar decisions have been completely overlooked, NWF states.
