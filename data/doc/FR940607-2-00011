Background 



On March 1, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 9727) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty orders listed below. Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the
Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of interest to interested parties and will revoke the
order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation or no interested party requests an administrative review
by the last day of the fifth anniversary month. 

We received timely objections from domestic interested parties to our intent to revoke these countervailing duty
orders. Therefore, because the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii) have not been met, we will not revoke the
orders. 

This determination is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4).
