FT  12 JUL 93 / People: Imperial Chemical Industries
Imperial Chemical Industries paints division has appointed John Hirst as the
first ever chief executive of ICI Auto-colour, the world's largest car
repair business outside the US. The unit was recently designated by Ronnie
Hampel, chief executive, as a core business, indicating that it is an area
in which the company plans to achieve world leadership.
Hirst's appointment follows a restructuring of the business. All Autocolour
around the world will report to him rather than the regional heads.
Hirst, 40, is a former finance director of ICI Paints' French subsidary who
became general manager of ICI Autocolour Europe in 1990. He speaks French,
German and Portuguese.
