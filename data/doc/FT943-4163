FT  10 SEP 94 / Cosatu leader re-elected
The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) yesterday re-elected
incumbent general secretary Mr Sam Shilowa and pledged to strengthen its
formal political alliance with the African National Congress and the South
African Communist party. The unopposed election of Mr Shilowa at the
federation's national congress in Soweto quashed speculation that he would
be challenged for the position, while approving continued links with the ANC
seemed to show willingness to co-operate with, rather than oppose, the
government. The federation has been struggling to define its role since many
leaders left the trade union movement for political office, and tensions
between the ANC-led government and Cosatu have risen over a recent wave of
strikes.
