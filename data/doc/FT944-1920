FT  17 DEC 94 / International Company News: Eramet in share swap for nickel
Eramet, the recently-listed French metals group, is swapping a 2.4 per cent
stake in its existing capital for Cofremmi, a subsidiary of Bureau de
Recherches Geologique et Minieres (BRGM) in a deal worth about FFr123m
(Dollars 22.7m).
The deal gives Eramet 800,000 tonnes of nickel contained in ore reserves in
several deposits in New Caledonia that are surrounded by deposits owned by
Societe Metallurgique Le Nickel (SLN), Eramet's subsidiary. Mr Alain Ray,
Eramet's planning director, said the acquisition would permit the economic
development of the total area. SLN's reserves previously totalled 2m tonnes
of nickel.
Eramet, the world's fourth-largest nickel producer, said it would increase
SLN's annual output by 20 per cent from 50,000 tonnes to 60,000 tonnes by
2000. Mr Ray said capacity would start to rise next year to 51,000-52,000
tonnes.
