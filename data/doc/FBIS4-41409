  [Text] Russia's state statistical service has reviewed the 
country's development in the first six months of the year. It 
says that a kind of record was set. Inflation dropped to the 
lowest level in all of the two and a half years of reform. It 
amounted to 6.9 percent. At the same time, through tough 
financial measures, the government has been able to slow down 
the growth of prices. But as the government experts say, it is 
too early to celebrate victory. In the same period there's been 
a record high bank emission. Almost four trillion more rubles 
were put into circulation. Experts say that such a big wave of 
money that are not backed by commodities or services could tell 
on the home market in two or three months.
