FT  29 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: Predatory pricing - Legal Briefs
A US Supreme Court ruling last week will make it harder for American
companies to win legal actions alleging predatory pricing by a competitor
designed to drive them out of the market.
By six votes to three, the court rejected a plea by cigarette maker Brooke
Group for reinstatement of a Dollars 150m award against Brown &amp; Williamson
Tobacco, part of BAT Industries. Brown &amp; Williamson had been accused of
unfair price-cutting in an attempt to drive Brooke out of the market for
generic cigarettes.
