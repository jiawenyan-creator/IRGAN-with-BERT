<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma </F>
Committee for International Affairs and ambassador to the United 
States, by unidentified correspondent; place and date not given; 
from the "Russian Diary" foreign affairs program--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Lukin] I believe the 
country's foreign policy should be based on national interests 
and not on party or class interests. The blueprint for foreign 
policy should be based solely on formulating a national idea of 
foreign policy. The blueprint is taking shape as an 
understanding of the role of the new Russia in the surrounding 
world, in neighboring and distant foreign countries. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] In whose head is it taking 
shape? In the Foreign Ministry on Smolenskaya Square or in the 
president's? 
  [Lukin] Perhaps you have noticed that lately, despite loud 
shouting and individual deviations, everyone agrees that our 
foreign policy should be more economical, more concerned with 
practical objectives, and more oriented toward neighboring 
foreign countries. It should be more concerned with its 
neighbors rather than with support for democracy in Haiti, for 
example, or the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire. To a larger extent 
it should be directed at helping Russia itself surmount the 
crisis rather than at general turgid declarations and statements 
like setting up a world order led by the United Nations or by 
helping with one's troops in Latin America or God knows where. 
Such an idea is gradually taking shape. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] What are the relations between the Duma 
committee for international affairs and Kozyrev and the Foreign 
Ministry? How will these relations develop? What is your 
prediction? And who is responsible for making what decisions? 
  [Lukin] It has become obvious already now that it is 
possible 
to agree on certain issues. For example, the Yugoslavia issue 
was discussed, and, except for some hasty and not very competent 
exotic statements, we essentially reached an agreement. We 
agreed on the statement on Yugoslavia which is very reasonable. 
Therefore, there is a possibility of reaching agreement. 
  As for who is responsible for what, under the Russian 
constitution, the president and the government pursue foreign 
policy. This is absolutely correct. Parliament should not 
implement foreign policy. They are implementing foreign policy 
into life. They are drawing up the main principles and rules of 
foreign policy. But parliament, whether the executive bodies 
want it or not, is a very essential and influential factor in 
formulating and implementing the foreign policy of the country. 
  [Correspondent] [passage omitted] 
  [Lukin] [passage omitted] Everything has changed now. Look, 
how much our relations with China have changed over the last few 
decades. Undoubtedly, we used to be a long way ahead of China 
in all respects. And now, except the nuclear field... [sentence 
unfinished as heard] 
  And our task now, of course, if we have a task, is to become 
a bridge linking the great Europe to the great Asia, not a 
bridge which one uses to walk on, but a connecting pole to 
combine the best European and Asian features.
