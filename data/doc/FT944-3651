FT  12 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt
The strength of Germany's economic recovery has taken economists and the
financial markets by surprise, with last week's third-quarter GDP figures
showing a further acceleration of growth in the western states.
This further weakened expectations that the Bundesbank would cut interest
rates again - according to Industrial Bank of Japan's Adolf Rosenstock, it
dealt them a 'lethal blow' - though it did not eliminate them altogether.
Capacity utilisation in industry is approaching levels which threaten to
push inflation higher, although prices have risen by a mere 1 per cent (on
an annualised basis) in the past three months.
Among those taking a cautious line on German rates is BHF-Bank, which sees
no pressing grounds for an early rise. Falling unit labour costs and weak
private consumption should make for a risk-free economic outlook in 1995.
But a rise in short-term rates in the second half cannot be excluded in
order to guard against inflation beyond next year, BHF feels.
The GDP strength took the market by surprise, but the reaction was mild;
inflation and money supply trends have been bond-positive, notes NatWest
Markets. With 10-year bund yields now around 7.30 per cent, Trinkaus Capital
Management expects an easing to 7 per cent in mid-1995.
