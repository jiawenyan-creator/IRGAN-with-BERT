  [Text] The security forces have completed an operation in 
Hebron aimed at apprehending armed Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] fugitives. Two terrorists were detained, and the body 
of another terrorist was discovered under the debris of a house 
which was demolished. The security forces are searching for the 
body of another terrorist. An IDF [Israel Defense Forces] force 
is searching the area in a bid to locate more fugitives. Our 
correspondent Moti Amir reports that during the operation shots 
were fired at an IDF force from a nearby cave; the soldiers 
returned the fire. The entire area is closed-off to traffic. 
The operation was launched in a bid to apprehend fugitives who 
are suspected of murdering the settlers near Bet Hagay last 
week. [see item TA1705072694 in previous Terrorism Report]
