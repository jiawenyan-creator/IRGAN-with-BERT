  [Text] President Ilyas al-Hirawi this afternoon received 
General Mustafa Talas, Syrian deputy prime minister and minister 
of defense, who led a Syrian delegation that included Gen. 'Ali 
Aslan, deputy chief of staff; Major General Ibrahim Safi, 
commander of the Syrian Arab forces operating in Lebanon; and 
Staff Brigadier General Ghazi Kan'an, chairman of the security 
and reconnaissance apparatus branch in the Syrian Arab Forces 
operating in Lebanon. The delegation came to offer condolences 
to President al-Hirawi on the death of his sister. 
  The Syrian delegation later met with Defense Minister Muhsin 
Dallul, who pointed out that they discussed general issues. 
Responding to a question, Dallul said that there are attempts to 
terrify the people. He denied any negligence on the part of the 
security agencies, calling on the people to refrain from 
questioning the efficiency of security and judiciary apparatuses 
and for giving them the chance to do their duty. 
  The Syrian delegation then visited Army Commander General 
Emile Lahhud and reviewed military issues and coordination 
between the two fraternal armies. Intelligence chief Colonel 
Michel Rahbani and his assistant, Col. Jamil al-Sayyid, attended 
the meeting.
