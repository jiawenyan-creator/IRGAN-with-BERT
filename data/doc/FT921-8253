FT  18 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains 2.1% on
official support for yen
THE YEN'S sharp upturn against the dollar following the Bank of Japan's
intervention on the foreign exchanges encouraged dealers to buy shares, and
the Nikkei average gained 2.1 per cent on the day, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue Nikkei closed 441.12 up at 21,324.98, recovering the important
21,000 level. Arbitrage-related selling sent the index to the day's low of
20,574.01 in the morning. However, afternoon reports of the central bank's
intervention to support the yen prompted a rise in bond prices, and the
Nikkei rose to the day's high of 21,325.68.
Activity was limited to dealers, and volume remained low at 200m shares
after Friday's 180m. Overall declines still led rises by 480 to 416, with
223 issues unchanged at the close. The Topix index of all first section
stocks rose 4.52 to 1,559.83, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased
2.46 to 1,199.25.
The Bank of Japan sold an estimated UDollars 500m against the yen. The
dollar, which traded around Y128 in the morning, closed at Y126.93, down
Y1.02 from last Friday.
Traders interpreted the Bank of Japan's move as an attempt to curb Japan's
exports, thus reducing the country's trade surplus. 'But the most effective
way is to cut interest rates,' said Mr Chris Turner at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd.
The bond and stock markets rose, as market participants saw a higher yen
limiting inflation and leading to lower interest rates.
High-technology issues rebounded from a bout of morning weakness following
Japanese brokers' downward revisions of their earnings forecasts for the
sector in the current year. Toshiba closed Y7 higher at Y628 and NEC added
Y10 at Y1,110.
Interest rate-sensitive large-capital issues firmed. Nippon Steel improved
Y4 to Y348 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries finished Y10 ahead at Y637.
Banks lost ground on corporate selling, locking in profits ahead of the
March book closing. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y70 to Y2,830 and Sumitomo
Bank Y60 to Y1,730.
Daito Trust Construction was the best performer of the day, climbing Y730 or
9.2 per cent to Y8,600. Investors who had sold the stock on earnings-related
rumours rushed to buy back the shares after the company announced a stock
split last Friday.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 69.13 to 22,642.52 in volume of 56.1m shares.
The index fell for the sixth consecutive day as constructions lost ground.
Roundup
ACTIVITY on the Pacific Rim reflected the closure of Wall Street last night,
and share prices were not impressed by Tokyo's gains.
TAIWAN plunged on reports that the central bank had suspended applications
from foreign fund companies for investment into the local stock market. The
weighted index tumbled 166.95 or 3.3 per cent to 4,856.48, following a small
gain of 3.02 points on Saturday. Turnover increased to TDollars 32.26bn from
TDollars 21.98bn.
Mr Samuel Shieh, the central bank governor, was quoted as saying that the
suspension was aimed at relieving upward pressure on the local currency
against the US dollar.
HONG KONG fell as profit-takers moved in after last week's gains. The Hang
Seng index receded 53.13 to 4,719.19, after setting records during five of
the preceding seven sessions. Turnover shrank to HKDollars 1.7bn from
HKDollars 2.3bn.
The property sector was dampened by a government report showing that the
vacancy rate of local residential flats rose last year. Cheung Kong lost 30
cents to HKDollars 21.10 and Hongkong Land slipped 20 cents to HKDollars
10.30.
AUSTRALIA had its second quietest day this year, turnover dropping to
ADollars 121m, its lowest since January 3. In spite of a firmer banking
sector, the All Ordinaries index closed 4.8 off at 1,614.2.
MANILA's composite index slid below 1,200, ending 22.65 weaker at 1,179.10.
Turnover fell from 138m pesos to 110.6m. The government's 5.5bn-peso
offering of 21 per cent of Philippine National Bank, scheduled for March 15,
is viewed as a threat to the market.
SEOUL also had its liquidity worries as the composite index dipped 7.57 to
640.14, turnover contracting to Won222bn, compared with levels of well over
Won300bn last week.
KUALA LUMPUR recovered from early weakness to end slightly higher in light
trading. The composite index gained a net 2.03 at 597.78 in turnover of
MDollars 132m, after MDollars 134m.
Buying interest continued in gaming stocks, and the lottery issue Tanjong
rose 25 cents to MDollars 8.70 with 1.4m shares traded. SINGAPORE lost
ground and the Straits Times Industrial index ended 9.10 lower at 1,494.81
in turnover of SDollars 86.44m, after SDollars 115.3m.
