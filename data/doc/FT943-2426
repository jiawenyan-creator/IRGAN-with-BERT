FT  19 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Brussels
The half-year results season continues with figures on Wednesday from
Powerfin, and on Thursday from Kredietbank, Cockerill Sambre and Tractebel.
Ms Rachael Roache at Kleinwort Benson says that the market is in transition
from being driven by interest rates to earnings and rising bond yields are
encouraging investors to demand better interim results.
She notes that during September, interim figures generally dictate market
performance and believes this year's economic recovery should allow for some
pleasant surprises, with better earnings compensating for weak bonds.
Ms Roache sees a favourable outlook for the market in the short term. 'In
the longer term, the defensive nature of the market bodes well for a return
to favour as rising interest rates spark a move out of cyclicals.'
At Goldman Sachs, Mr Pierre Stiennon agrees that the market will be
increasingly earnings-driven, but says that this will depress the interest
rate-sensitive stocks like banks, insurers and utilities, as rate cuts come
to an end. 'However, the defensive features of these stocks can prove
attractive in an uncertain environment and this could again be the case if
the market turns more pessimistic.'
