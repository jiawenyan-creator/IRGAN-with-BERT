FT  03 SEP 92 / Letter: Bureaucracy of quality
Sir, One aspect of quality schemes (Letters, August 25) needs a great deal
of attention - they appear to be spawning their own bureaucracy.
My company achieved BS5750 some years ago and has benefited as part of our
overall approach to customer service. However, a disproportionate amount of
our quality team's time is spent filling in inquiries from other quality
departments requiring copious and often irrelevant information.
Efforts should be intensified to promote BS5750 certification as sufficient
evidence of satisfactory standing for most commercial purposes, leaving only
specific technical inquiries relating to the products involved to be
pursued.
