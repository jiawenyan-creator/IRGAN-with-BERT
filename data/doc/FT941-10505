All is revealed as to how Peter Job, the peripatetic Reuters chief
executive, had, at the last count this past summer, clocked up visits to 69
different nations during his time with the company. At yesterday's press
conference, he explained that the news and information service can now count
terminals in 150 countries, but went on to admit that even he had difficulty
in remembering quite which they were. So he had boned up on Reuters internal
list ahead of his date with the press - to find Iceland omitted, but
Chessington included.
