FT  07 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities lose steam after
recent upsurge
AFTER delivering gains for 11 consecutive days, and setting six new record
highs in the process, the upsurge in US stock markets finally ran out of
steam yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.35 at 3,200.13, and
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.38 easier at 417.96. The
Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, however, powered to yet another
all-time high, adding 5.25 at 597.90. Turnover on the vy 251m shares.
The market opened hesitantly as Mr David Dinkins, the Mayor of New York,
rang the opening bell to celebrate the start of the NYSE's bicentenary year,
and amid strong two-way trading, share prices struggled to add to last
week's gains. In spite of selling, the underlying tone of the market was
still positive, aided by another decline in long-term interest rates on the
US Treasury markets.
Westinghouse stood out, advancing Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 19 3/4 in
turnover of 3.9m shares on the heels of an upgrade from London based
stockbroker County NatWest, which raised its rating from 'underperform' to
'accumulate'.
Teledyne jumped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 24 1/2 after the electronics and
aviation equipment group reported fourth-quarter profits of 50 cents a
share, against just 1 cent a share a year ago.
Waste Management declined Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 44 5/8 in active trading,
unsettled by a court ruling in California which blocked the company's
planned construction of a toxic waste incinerator. Industry experts predict
that the success of the lawsuit brought by local residents could pose
problems for Waste Management in similar cases in the future.
On the over-the-counter market, Borland International dropped Dollars 3 1/4
to Dollars 80 amid growing concern that there may be delays in the release
of new personal computer software products. This concern was behind Morgan
Stanley's decision to lower its first-quarter Borland profits forecast from
75 cents a share to 50 cents.
Going the other way was MCI Communications, which climbed Dollars 2 1/2 to
Dollars 33 7/8 in turnover of 4.7m after Merrill Lynch upgraded its
medium-term rating on the stock.

THE TORONTO composite index closed a modest 7.3 up at 3,524.8 as gains in
transportation and communication stocks were largely offset by losses in the
metals sector.
Advancing issues led declines by 335 to 247 after a light volume of 22m
shares. Eleven of 14 sub-group indices were in positive territory. The
transportation group strengthened 3.1 per cent, boosted by Laidlaw 'B',
which gained CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 10 7/8 . The communications and media
group was up 2.0 per cent and merchandising gained 1.1 per cent. Mining lost
1.3 per cent and golds shed 1.8 per cent.
