FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: First Leisure venture with BAe
First Leisure has formed a joint venture with British Aerospace to run two
marinas. It said the move was the beginning of an expansion of its marina
business.
First Leisure and Arlington, British Aerospace's property subsidiary, will
each have a 50 per cent interest in Associated Marinas. The company will run
the First Leisure marina in Chichester and the British Aerospace marina at
Port Solent, Portsmouth.
First Leisure will receive Pounds 5.9m in cash from Associated Marinas,
which will finance the payment by borrowing. It is understood BAe will
receive what is described as 'only a small amount'.
First Leisure said its discotheques division had had a strong year, with
sales up 12 per cent and spend per head rising 2 per cent.
Resorts enjoyed a 9 per cent sales increase.
Bowling sales in September and October were at the same level as last year
but on a like-for-like basis were down 13 per cent over the year.
New bowling centres and the recently acquired health and fitness centre in
Bracknell, however, helped lift sales in the bowling and health sector by 13
per cent.
Bingo sales rose by 3 per cent, with spend per head rising 6 per cent.
The group said it would revalue a third of its property portfolio each year,
instead of dealing with the entire portfolio once every three years.
Pre-opening expenses will now be depreciated over 12 months from the start
of trading rather than over five years.
This will reduce pre-tax profits for 1992-93 and 1991-92 by about Pounds 1m
in each year. The impact on this year's profits would be smaller, the
company said.
Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds 36m this year.
