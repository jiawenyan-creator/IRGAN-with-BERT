FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Flat defence market hits CAE
Industries
CAE INDUSTRIES, the Canadian-based commercial and military flight simulator
and training group, reported flat revenues and earnings for the year ended
March 31 because of stagnant defence and aviation markets.
Net profit was CDollars 32.2m (USDollars 25.2m), or 30 cents a share,
against CDollars 32.8m, or 31 cents, in fiscal 1992, on revenues of CDollars
1bn, compared with CDollars 1.05bn. The simulator division recorded lower
operating profit, but the order backlog at March 31 was CDollars 460m, up 17
per cent.
CAE's total order backlog at March 31 was CDollars 1.3bn, down from CDollars
1.5bn, due to lower US defence spending. However, the group said that it had
won 70 per cent of the world commercial flight simulator market during the
fiscal year.
The group's US military training unit and the German subsidiary did better,
as did the Canadian aircraft overhaul operations and the expanding
industrial products division.
