VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: LAKE CASITAS; 
CLAIMS OVER FATAL ACCIDENT REJECTED 
The Casitas Municipal Water District has rejected claims of negligence filed by 
the families of an Oxnard man who was killed and two others who were injured in 
an automobile accident at the Lake Casitas campground last summer. 
Anthony Tinoco, 20, died in the Aug. 11 accident. 
Oxnard residents Victor Ramirez, 17, and Ignacio Ramirez, 19, who are not 
related, were injured. 
The families of the three men each filed claims last month totaling more than 
$15 million. 
The district board of directors rejected the claims last week. 
The three men were among seven people riding in a pickup that plunged 45 feet 
down a ravine at the campgrounds. 
Tinoco died of head injuries, California Highway Patrol officials said. 
According to the claims, Victor Ramirez suffered minor arm injuries, while 
Ignacio Ramirez was hospitalized with severe head injuries. 
Officers arrested the driver of the truck, Tracey Rene Moore, 21, of Ojai on 
suspicion of felony drunken driving. 
The claims said the water district is responsible because it improperly 
constructed the roadway. 
The claims also allege that park rangers failed to control drinking on the 
campgrounds and allowed cars to enter and leave the grounds to buy alcoholic 
beverages. 
The claims seek $5 million in general damages for the Tinoco family, $505,000 
for the family of Victor Ramirez and $10.13 million for the family of Ignacio 
Ramirez. 
Curtis Simpson, an attorney for the firm that represents the families, said the 
families will probably file a lawsuit. HUGO MARTIN
