FT  15 SEP 94 / Privately financed N-plant suggested
It may be possible to build a nuclear power station in the UK entirely with
private-sector finance, says a report by NM Rothschild, the City merchant
bank, David Lascelles writes.
The report, commissioned by Nuclear Electric, the state-owned utility, will
go to the government's nuclear review which closes at the end of this month.
It will also be made public.
In its submission to the review earlier this summer the utility said a
nuclear power station could not be built without a measure of government
financial backing.
Mr Michael Kirwan, its finance director, told the FT conference on nuclear
power yesterday that Rothschild's conclusions depended on a number of
conditions. One was that a new station would have to be linked with Nuclear
Electric's operations.
The report suggests that a privatised nuclear industry would be more
successful in raising private-sector finance than one backed by government
and liable to political influence.
