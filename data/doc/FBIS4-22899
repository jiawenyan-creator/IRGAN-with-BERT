  [Abstract] The system for selecting rec[.sup]-[/] yeast 
mutants based on taking into account the interplasmid 
recombination proposed earlier by the authors is examined 
further, and the findings of a study of one mutant which was 
produced with the help of this system and is characterized by a 
decreased interplasmid recombination frequency are presented. 
The rec41 mutant under study was produced from the 2D-3031 
haploid strain. The study indicates that rec41-1 mutation lowers 
the efficiency of double-strand DNA break repairs due to the 
interplasmid and, possibly, interchromosomal and interchromatide 
recombination, leading to an elevated sensitivity of the mutant 
cells to ionizing radiation. An incomplete block of repair and 
recombination processes in rec41 mutant cells is probably due to 
the rec41-1 mutation phenotype. The REC41 gene was cloned in the 
pL3 multicopy vector. Integration mapping shows that the REC41 
gene is located on the left arm of the VII chromosome, very 
close to the LYS5 gene. Plans for sequencing this gene and 
further investigating its genetic properties are outlined.
