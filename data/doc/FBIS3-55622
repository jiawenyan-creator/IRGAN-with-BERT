  [Text] In an interview with Interfax the chief of 
Belarus's Security Committee, Eduard Shirkovskiy, has dismissed 
rumors that the copies of the files relating to Lee Harvey 
Oswald, who was charged with having assassinated President John 
Kennedy, will be handed to President Bill Clinton during his 
visit to Minsk. The massive files relating to Oswald, who lived 
in Minsk for some time, are in the archives of the Belarusian 
KGB. 
  According to Shirkovskiy, "the Oswald files are classified, 
and in the absence of parliamentary resolution on the destiny of 
the KGB archives it's impossible to hand these materials to any 
one."
