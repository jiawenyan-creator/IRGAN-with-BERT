  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRES, 28/1/1994 -- Dniester's problem 
will be solved only by the new Moldovan leadership once the 
consequences of Ribbentrop-Molotov pact are liquidated and 
territories occupied after World War II are returned with the 
participation of the interested states -- Romania and Ukraine, 
says the newspaper GLASUL NATIUNII (Voice of Nation). Dniester 
practically no longer belongs to Moldova, states the newspaper. 
The lasting negotiations between Chisinau and Tiraspol, the war 
in summer 1992, and the Ilascu trial proves that Moldovan 
authorities have no influence on so-called Dniester Republic, 
says the newspaper. Moldovans no longer represent 40 percent of 
Dniester population, most of them were assimilated by the 
Ukrainian and Russian ethnics. The newspaper appraises that 
Dniester will not exist as an independent state. Separated from 
Russia by Ukrainian borders, it can rather become an annex of 
one of these two states. The newspaper adds that Dniester 
leadership plays a secondary role in settling the Dniester's 
problem. It can be solved by Russian and Moldovan leadership, 
concludes the newspaper.
