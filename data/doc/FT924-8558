FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (15): Integrated banking
system at branch level
NATIONAL WESTMINSTER Bank is spending Pounds 20m in the current year to get
a comprehensive dedicated computer communications system up and running.
Olivetti is installing more than 1,000 network controllers at NatWest -
these controllers offer a high degree of communication in retail banking
applications.
The controllers summon personal account data via the bank's network.
To develop its nationwide branch server network, the bank is using systems
from Symicron Computer Communications of Eltham. Mr John Tilbrook,
Symicron's chairman, says: 'It was imperative for the bank to 'marry' its
existing network to the application needs at branch level. This demanded
full flexibility of communications options.'
The installed NatWest solution involves a combination of Symicron's products
for open systems interconnection (OSI), System Network Architecture (SNA)
and Unix TCP/IP communications. More details on the Symicron system are
available on 081-857-5577.
