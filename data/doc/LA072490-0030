PLAN TO GO ON WITH TUNNEL JOB OUTLINED 
Engineers in charge of Metro Rail subway construction Monday outlined plans to 
work around a fire-gutted section of tunnel in an effort to keep the 
much-delayed project from falling further behind schedule. 
"If a fire had to occur anywhere in the (tunnel complex), that section causes 
us the least problems," said Bob Campbell, project controls manager for Ralph 
M. Parsons Co., Dillingham Construction Co., and Deleuw, Cather &amp; Co., the 
consortium hired to oversee Metro Rail construction. 
Fire of unknown origin July 13 gutted one of two, parallel tunnels under 
construction near Union Station, causing one stretch of the 750-foot long 
tunnel to collapse and blocking traffic on U.S. 101 through downtown Los 
Angeles for more than three days. 
Following a meeting of the Rail Construction Corp., the government agency which 
helps direct both subway and light rail construction in the county, Campbell 
repeated earlier claims that the fire should not cause further delays in 
overall construction of the 4.4-mile subway system. The $1.4-billion project, 
already months behind schedule, now is slated to open in September, 1993. 
Campbell told Rail Construction Corp. board members that it is possible workers 
could begin laying track on schedule in the undamaged tunnel in early November. 
They would by-pass the damaged tunnel while repairs are being made. 
Richard Kunz, deputy construction manager for the building consortium, said the 
heavily damaged northern section of the tunnel can be repaired by replacing all 
of the wooden supports and applying "shotcrete," a heavy-duty, air-blown form 
of concrete, to the tunnel walls. 
Surprisingly, he said, the southern end of the tunnel was less severely damaged 
than first feared and may be repaired by replacing wood timbers and adding 
concrete grout. Officials still must decide whether to excavate or tunnel 
through the middle section, which collapsed in the fire, Kunz said.
