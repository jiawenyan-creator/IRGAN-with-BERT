Application-Specific Circuits in Europe"] 
  [Text] The Korean company Samsung is counting on its 
300,000- gate array circuits and on its rapid prototyping 
service to expand into the consumer, information technology, and 
telecommunications markets. 
  Samsung, whose ASIC [application-specific integrated 
circuits] activity represents less than one percent of its 
European revenues in semiconductors ($500 million in 1993, up 50 
percent on a world total of $2.3 billion), intends to do 
something about this situation and, quoting Samsung 
Semiconductor Europe spokesman Peter Anders, "to diversify into 
a more stable market than the memory market." His objective for 
1994 is a sales figure of $10 million in this area. To achieve 
this the Korean company, which has just installed its first 
European design center near Frankfurt in Germany, is planning to 
open design centers in all major continental European countries 
in the coming year. 
  As for products, Samsung is now offering a range of gate 
arrays in 0.65-micron CMOS [complementary metal oxide 
semiconductor] technology integrating a maximum of 300,000 gates 
and operating at 3.3-V voltage in Europe. A range of standard 
cell circuits, enabling up to 350,000 gates to be integrated in 
the same 0.65-micron technology, should be available by 
mid-1994. Samsung is aiming at mid-range consumer, information 
technology, and telecommunications applications, where it has a 
certain expertise and where it can take advantage of what is 
considers its two strongest points: the availability of cell 
libraries comprising digital signal processors (DSP) and 
microcontrollers (Z80 compatible); and its rapid prototyping 
capacity (25 days for standard cell circuits and 45 days for 
gate arrays).
