FT  14 FEB 92 / Observer: Torch songs
For golden disc, read 'Red Sun'. Sales of a cassette album with that name
have soared to 1.7m copies in China, to the pique of the reformists vying
with conservatives in the country' leadership.
The album, which might be subtitled 'Hits of the Cultural Revolution',
consists of 30 songs deifying Mao Tse-tung which were popular when his
devotees were burning books, smashing temples and purging intellectuals in
the late 1960s and early 70s.
The cassette is produced by China Record's Shanghai branch whose manager,
Zhou Jianchao, says his company decided to 'dig up' the old songs as a
welcome change from the Taiwanese and Hong Kong pop at present dominating
China's music industry. They are popular simply because they're familiar, he
explains.
But they jar the ears of Shanghai's Liberation Daily paper. Calling on
China's music writers to come up with new songs more suited to the times, it
declared: 'We cannot again create a god and a personality cult.'
