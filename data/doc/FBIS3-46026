  [Text] Seoul, January 26 (XINHUA) -- South Korea [ROK] and 
the United States are "positively" considering deployment of 
Patriot missiles at bases of the American forces in Korea, South 
Korean Vice-Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong said here Wednesday 
[26 January]. 
  "Negotiations are under way between the two countries," Hong 
said, "as to the size and time of deployment, decisions will be 
made after further consultations." 
  "We hope that the deployment (of Patriot missiles) will 
enhance South Korea-U.S. defense capability," he said. 
  South Korea will not purchase Patriot missiles and the anti- 
missile defense system will be part of the weaponry deployed by 
the U.S. forces in Korea at their bases, Hong added. 
  At present, about 36,000 U.S. soldiers are stationed in 
South 
Korea.
