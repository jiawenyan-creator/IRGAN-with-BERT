<F P=106> ["N.M."- signed report: "Tudor Postelnicu Released From </F>
Jail for Six Months"] 
  [Text] Tudor Postelnicu, 63, former interior minister in 
the government headed by Constantin Dascalescu [during the 
Ceausescu regime], has been released from jail for six months in 
order to receive medical treatment. Postelnicu left the Jilava 
penitentiary yesterday. He is suffering from several urological 
and cardiovascular ailments. Just one day before Postelnicu 
left the penitentiary, his wife underwent surgery following an 
accident in which she fractured her thighbone. If we are not 
mistaken, the only remaining member of the CPEx [Executive 
Political Committee of the former Romanian Communist Party] in 
jail at Jilava after the release of Postelnicu would be Ion 
Dinca [former first deputy prime minister].
