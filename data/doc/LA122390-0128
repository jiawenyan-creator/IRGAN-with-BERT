NEWSWIRE: MISCELLANY 
A TAC panel hearing the appeal of shotputter Randy Barnes' drug suspension 
adjourned without reaching a finding. 
The panel, meeting in Washington, could not reach a decision because it was 
waiting for documents to review. A decision in the case is expected next week. 
Barnes, the world record-holder in the shotput, was suspended by the 
International Amateur Athletic Federation for two years on Nov. 6 after testing 
positive for an anabolic steroid at a meet in Sweden last August.
