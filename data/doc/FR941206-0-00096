Medicare, Medicaid and CLIA Programs; Extension of Certain Effective Dates for Clinical Laboratory Requirements
and Personnel Requirements for Cytologists 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and Public Health Service (PHS), HHS.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule with comment period. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule extends certain effective dates for clinical laboratory requirements in regulations published
on February 28, 1992, which implemented provisions of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA)
and announces our approval of a certifying organization for qualifying cytotechnologists. This rule extends the
date by which an individual must enroll in an HCFA-approved cytology proficiency testing (PT) program and the date
by which an individual with a doctoral degree must possess board certification to qualify as a director of a laboratory
that performs high complexity testing. In addition, we are extending the phase-in of the quality control requirements
applicable to unmodified, moderate complexity tests cleared for commercial distribution by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). We are extending the date to meet applicable CLIA QC requirements for laboratories using commercial, nonmodified
tests to fulfill certain quality control (QC) requirements. 


These effective date extensions do not reduce the current requirements for quality test performance. The date extensions
are necessary due to the limited number and scope of currently operating cytology PT programs, resource constraints
that have prevented commencement of the substantial number of quality control reviews, and inability of many laboratory
directors to complete certification requirements within the time period originally specified.

<DATE>
DATES:

 These regulations are effective on December 6, 1994. Comments will be considered if we receive them at the appropriate
