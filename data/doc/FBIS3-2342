  [Text] Shanghai, March 5 (XINHUA) -- Though Shanghai women 
believe that being a professor is the most respect-worthy 
career, they would actually rather choose highly-paid jobs for 
themselves, as managers and factory directors, a recent survey 
showed. 
  The conclusion was reached by the Shanghai Sociological 
Institute, which delivered 500 questionnaires to local women in 
all walks of life. 
  Three occupations -- professor, lawyer and writer -- gained 
the highest esteem among local women, followed by serving in the 
armed services, factory director, doctor, engineer, journalist, 
primary and middle school teacher. 
  Asked what kind of job they wanted to take up, the 
guinea-pigs put factory director and manager on the top. The 
second choice was bank clerk, accountant, lawyer, doctor, boss 
of private business, journalist, tax collector, primary and 
middle school teacher and pop singer. 
  In the eyes of Shanghai women, manager, factory director, 
boss of private business and pop singer are the three fattest 
jobs in current China. 
  Based on the results of the survey, sociologists said that 
instead of staying home to be housewives, Shanghai women are 
trying to find their own direction in the fast-moving society. 
  It also showed that esteem of knowledge and intellectuals is 
rising.
