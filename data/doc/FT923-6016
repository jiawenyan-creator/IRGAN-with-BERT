FT  27 AUG 92 / Owners Abroad to cut holidays
OWNERS Abroad, Britain's second largest travel company, said yesterday that
it will offer 100,000 fewer summer holidays next year to give some stability
to the package tour market.
The announcement came a day after Thomson, the biggest holiday company, said
it was determined to restore its market share to one third and called on its
rivals to offer fewer holidays in 1993. Thomson said its market share this
year was 30 per cent.
Mr Dermot Blastland, managing director of Owners Abroad's tour operations,
said the company's market share had remained constant at about 19 per cent.
It sold 1.64m summer holidays this year, against a target of 1.75m.
Owners Abroad has frequently said it is more interested in increasing profit
margins than winning a set proportion of the market.
Mr Blastland said the instability and price-cutting in the holiday market
were the result of the collapse of Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure
Group (ILG) last year. Previously, ILG was the second biggest travel
company.
Mr Blastland said that companies had competed for ILG's share of the
business throughout this year. 'When a company with a 20 per cent market
share disappears, it takes a little bit of time to work out the
implications,' he said.
He added that he expected the UK holiday market to decline by about 5 per
cent next year.
Owners Abroad said the average price of its summer holidays would rise by 3
per cent in 1993, a similar increase to that announced by Thomson. The
weakness of the dollar would, however, enable it to reduce prices to Florida
by 10 per cent. It intends to double the number of holidays to Florida to
50,000.
