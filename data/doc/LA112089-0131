LOSING COWBOYS SACKED WITH MONEY WOES 
The troubles facing the Dallas Cowboys have spread from the playing field into 
the National Football League team's business affairs, a published report said. 
The Cowboys have the worst record in the NFL this season. And in recent months, 
the club has fallen behind in paying routine bills and making mortgage 
payments, team owner Jerry Jones told the Dallas Times Herald. 
The newspaper also reported the team held rookie quarterback Troy Aikman's 
$1.5-million paycheck until after banking hours and is negotiating with a group 
of doctors to sell the Cowboys Valley Ranch headquarters. 
Jones, who paid $130 million for the team last February, told the Times Herald 
that some of the club's bills have gone unpaid for up to 60 days. 
"Obviously the Dallas Cowboys lost money last year," Jones said. "The Dallas 
Cowboys were not a moneymaker. That didn't discourage me, and I feel very 
strongly that it's a sound business. 
"So when the Cowboys need any money for their cash flow, a part of what I do is 
provide that money for them." 
The Cowboys did not sign Aikman's lump-sum paycheck until after banking hours 
Nov. 1 because there would not have been enough money in team accounts to cover 
the check, sources said. A TV payment was received and deposited the next day. 
Jones also confirmed that the team is trying to sell its 80,000-square-foot 
headquarters building and surrounding 28 acres. 
William Pestinger, who operates a chiropractic clinic near Valley Ranch, said 
he and his colleagues are close to finalizing a deal.
