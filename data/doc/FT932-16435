FT  06 APR 93 / Business and the Law: New Delhi's setback - Legal Briefs
LITIGATION between the English firm of solicitors Zaiwalla &amp; Co and the
Indian government over unpaid legal fees is close to settlement after a
two-week hearing in the High Court estimated to have cost some Pounds
400,000. On Friday New Delhi formally abandoned its counterclaim for Dollars
585,000 alleging negligence against Zaiwalla &amp; Co after the judge Mr Justice
Gatehouse said the counterclaim was 'hopeless' and should never have been
brought in the first place. The firm is seeking payment of fees accumulated
over five years for representing the Indian government in London.
