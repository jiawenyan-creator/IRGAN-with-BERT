FT  15 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Traded options
I am operating on the traded options market with money put forward in equal
amounts by myself and three relatives. The account is in my name for ease of
trading and money management. Is there a way we can use up our individual
CGT allowances under this pooled trading system to the satisfaction of the
Inland Revenue?
Presumably you have read the free Private Investor's Guide to the Taxation
of LIFFE Equity Options. If not, ask your broker (or LIFFE's publications
department) for a copy. It was written last January.
Each of the four of you should report a quarter of each transaction in his
or her tax return. You might like to do all the CGT calculations and simply
tell the others what figures to put in their returns.
Doubtless there is adequate documentary evidence of the arrangements between
you, which can be produced to your tax inspector if need be.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
