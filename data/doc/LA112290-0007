SQUABBLE OVER AIRLINE MOVIE 
Sun has the right to question the fairness of having to pay for headset rentals 
to watch in-flight movies, although to me the situation is so self-evident that 
the rule leaves no ambiguity. 
The revolting part of the story, however, is Sun's message to the captain -- 
"I'm a lawyer and if anything happened on the ground, I would file a suit." If 
the lawyer was really concerned about possible disciplinary proceedings in the 
State Bar, as he sat handcuffed in the police station, it would be more aptly 
for this abuse of his professional status.
