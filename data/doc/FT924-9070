FT  07 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Revamped Maddox moves back into black
MADDOX GROUP, the electrical products and computer maintenance concern which
this year has undergone substantial changes, moved back into the black in
the first half of 1992.
A pre-tax profit of Pounds 325,000 compared with losses of Pounds 83,000 for
the six months to September 30 1991 and Pounds 312,000 for the preceding
nine months period.
Results excluded any contribution from Wakebourne, the computer maintenance
and systems support group acquired in August, which had changed the focus of
Maddox.
Mr Hugo Biermann, chairman, said the provision of maintenance services to
particularly the corporate PC market in the UK, had proved to be
exceptionally resilient, with growth of over 20 per cent in the last five
years. Maddox therefore intended to continue its penetration of this market
 -particularly in the UK.
While the group's distribution markets were still affected by recession in
the UK and US, Wakebourne was trading in line with the board's high
expectations. Mr Biermann said that this, together with the further
refocusing of the business towards computer maintenance, would allow Maddox
to produce a satisfactory result for the year. First half sales were Pounds
9.55m (Pounds 183,000) and earnings per share came to 0.21p (0.35p losses).
There was again no tax.
