  [Text] Riga, May 10 (LETA) -- The newspaper DIENA reports 
today on a possible replacement of some ministers which was 
discussed at the meeting of the "Latvia's Way" faction on 
Saturday [7 May]. However the party's official stated that 
there is no connection between the scheduled changes in the 
government and a possible breakdown of the ruling coalition. 
Some portfolio reappointments might be expected after the 
discussion on the work performed by the government during nine 
months. Apparently the changes in the government will possibly 
occur before MP summer vacations. One of the leaders of 
"Latvia's Way," Indulis Berzins, said that it is not an intended 
breakdown of the coalition which is in question. If the premier 
wishes to replace a minister this post will be offered to a 
counterpart of the coalition. In case the Farmers Union's 
officials find it necessary to leave the coalition then 
portfolios will be offered to other parties with the exception 
of right and left radicals -- "Equal Rights" and "For Fatherland 
and Freedom".
