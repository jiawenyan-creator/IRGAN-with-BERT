  [Text] The People's Movement of Ukraine [Rukh] has issued 
an appeal calling on the Ukrainian president and Supreme Council 
to take effective measures for the constitution and laws of 
Ukraine to be implemented in Crimea and the territorial 
integrity of the Ukrainian state to be ensured. Under the 
conditions of Russia's continuing informational, organizational, 
and parliamentary aggression in Crimea, the People's Movement 
deems it necessary to halt the withdrawal of nuclear weapons 
from the territory of Ukraine, the document stresses. 
  Rukh also appeals to the UN Security Council and the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and requests 
them to prevent Ukraine from being taken to pieces and being 
plunged into a civil war.
