  [Text] As the Azerbaijani army failed to make gains in 
south-eastern parts of Karabakh, it has been desperately trying 
for the second day running to break through the Karabakh 
defences on the eastern section of the front. 
  A spokesman for the Army Headquarters of the self-proclaimed 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic has reported to Interfax that Friday 
night the Azerbaijanis tried to advance toward Agdam, but their 
attempt was dashed. 
  After intensive artillery shelling Saturday morning, the 
Azerbaijani forces resumed their offensive toward the Novruzlu 
community. According to reports from Stepanakert, the enemy was 
forced to retreat to where it had come from with casualties.
