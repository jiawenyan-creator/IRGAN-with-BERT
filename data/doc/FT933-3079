FT  15 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich returns to work in
positive mood
A stronger dollar helped some of the bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
ZURICH returned to work after Monday's local holiday in unexpectedly
positive mood. The SMI index rose 22.7 to 2,388.3 with Soffex related
position squaring helping.
Mr Beat Alpiger of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich commented that signs had begun
to emerge last week that the market was bottoming out.
However, yesterday's trend had been unexpectedly positive since the overall
environment had not changed. He had expected a further consolidation;but
instead, he thought that the market was now beginning to build hopes that
the Swiss National Bank would follow Germany's lead and reduce interest
rates.
Among banks, UBS added SFr29 to SFr1,140 and SBC added SFr11 to SFr454, and
in pharmaceuticals, Roche certificates put on SFr50 to SFr1062.
Swissair dipped SFr5 to SFr730 in spite of announcing that negotiations were
continuing on its planned merger with KLM, SAS and Austrian Airlines and
that it was confident of a decision soon.
Ms Susanne Borer of Bank Vontobel in Zurich, commented that such a link
would provide a number of benefits for Swissair, including access to the
European Economic Area, and further opportunities for rationalisation of
services and cost cutting.
FRANKFURT managed an 8 point gain as investors remained generally inactive,
partly on account of Friday's triple witching.
The DAX index closed at 1,880.57, after a high of 1,884 and a low of 1,876.
Turnover was DM5.4bn.
Mr Jochen Waiblinger of BHF bank commented that the market was going through
a consolidation phase at present and that it was possible that the next two
weeks could see the index dropping further.
A number of factors remained on investors' minds, he said, including the
macro economic picture. Data should be available later in the month, he
noted, which would provide an indication as to the expected direction of the
German economy. If the signals were that the recession had bottomed-out it
was to be expected that buyers would come back into the market, he said, and
that a range of cyclicals would provide attraction, as well as some
financials and chemicals.
Among the day's movers, Preussag and Degussa both rose DM5 to DM411 and
DM344.50 respectively.
PARIS moved in a narrow range before settling higher on the day. The CAC-40
index finished up 15.07 at 2,134.14, after a high of 2,141 and a low of
2,121. Turnover was FFr3.1bn.
Eurotunnel maintained Monday's active trading, although there was an absence
of news to explain the gains. Having seen a year's high of FFr44.60 the
shares slipped back in late trading to close 35 centimes higher at FFr43.70.
Lafarge Coppee announced that it planned to raise FFr2.5bn in cash and to
offer a 1 for 10 share issue by the end of the year, and the shares put on
FFr7 to FFr421, but off the day's high of FFr427.
The news from Legrand, which announced its interim results, pleased market
analysts and the shares gained FFr205 to FFr4,815.
AMSTERDAM was lifted by a stronger dollar as the CBS Tendency index added
0.9 to 125.2. Activity was seen in Akzo, up Fl 3.40 to Fl 172.20 and DSM, up
Fl 1.40 to Fl 94.40 and Ahold, up Fl 1.80 to Fl 89.70.
MILAN was helped ahead by US fund buying and the firmer lira, with
telecommunications issues and insureres among the beneficiaries. The Comit
index added 8.59 or 1.4 per cent to 606.14, with prices underpinned by
short-covering ahead of today's close of the monthly trading account.
Fiat's insurance unit Toro rose L1,576 or 5.2 per cent to L31,731, aided by
speculation it will soon be sold as part of Fiat's asset disposals. Alleanza
added L692 to L20,958 and Generali was L638 higher at L40,444.
Trading in Ferruzzi began almost two hours late after no buyers could be
found for 27m sell orders. Subsequently, the share again plunged L40.40 to
L363, the fall matching 10 per cent declines seen in the two previous
trading sessions.
San Paolo shed L521 or 4.8 per cent to L10,272 after details of its proposed
merger with two subsidiaries, Banco Lariano and Banca Provinciale Lombarda,
were announced on Monday night. Analysts noted that this had presented an
arbitrage opportunity to short San Paolo and go long on Lariano as a way of
buying into San Paolo at a discount.
STOCKHOLM saw profit-taking in Ericsson B shares leave the stock down SKr11
to SKr398, while Volvo B managed a SKr2 rise to SKr432. The Affarsvarlden
general index rose 1.9 to 1,287.5.
MADRID rose at the close, pulled up by US quoted stocks and the general
index added 3.53 to 288.68. Banesto recovered Pta95 or 3.8 per cent to
Pta2,560 as one US broker upgraded the stock.
