FT  10 MAR 94 / Heathrow attack a reminder of IRA capabilities
The Heathrow attack served as a potentially devastating reminder of the
IRA's continuing capability to strike on the British mainland and to extract
maximum publicity for its cause, Michael Cassell and Jimmy Burns write.
The mortar assault, although it ended in failure, inevitably gave rise to
speculation that an attack on such a high-profile, security-sensitive target
provides the IRA's answer to the Downing Street declaration.
The organisation prides itself on its independent cell structure which gives
considerable autonomy to on-the-ground 'active service units'. But security
sources believe it unlikely that such an attack would be planned and mounted
without the knowledge of the higher echelons of the IRA command.
MI5 and Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist experts have been privately warning
for months of the possibility of another 'big one' on the mainland to raise
the political stakes.
According to security experts, last night's attack would have been planned
over several weeks, using an active unit of about three people and an
intelligence and support team of at least twice that number.
The mortars and explosive material are likely to have been assembled in at
least one mainland safe-house or depot although the decision to activate the
operation would have come within 24 hours of the attack.
In spite of an impression that the IRA wound down activities in the period
after the joint declaration, the reality is that its campaign has continued
throughout. Until last night, however, it had been confined to Ulster.
