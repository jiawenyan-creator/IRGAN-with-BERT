Paul H. Calverley, State Conservationist, Soil Conservation Service, 3244 Elder Street, Room 124, Boise, Idaho,
83705, telephone (208) 3341601.




NOTICE: 

Pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Council on Environmental Quality
Guidelines (40 CFR Part 1500); and the Soil Conservation Service Guidelines (7 CFR Part 650); the Soil Conservation
Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, gives notice that an environmental impact statement is not being prepared
for the Spring Valley Picnic Shelter RCD Project, Latah County, Idaho.




The Environmental Assessment of this federally assisted action indicates that the project will not cause significant
local, regional, or national impacts on the environment. As a result of these findings, Paul H. Calverley, State Conservationist,
has determined that the preparation and review of an environmental impact statement was not needed for this project.


The RCD Project will upgrade an existing picnic area with the addition of a picnic shelter and a concrete walkway
for better handicap access. These measures will attract people away from high impact areas along the edge of the reservoir,
causing less soil erosion and reducing conflict with other users.


This Notice of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency.
The basic data developed during the environmental assessment are on file and may be reviewed by contacting Mr. Paul
H. Calverley. The FONSI has been sent to various federal, state and local agencies, and interested parties. A limited
number of copies of the FONSI are available to fill single copy requests at the address stated on the previous page.


No administrative action on the proposal will be initiated until 30 days after the date of this publication in the 

Federal Register.
