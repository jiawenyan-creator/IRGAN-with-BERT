 

The Conference supports the use of prehearing conferences and stipulations, which could streamline the hearing
process by narrowing issues and ensuring that the necessary evidence will be available at the hearing. In some cases,
a prehearing conference may obviate the need for a hearing. It is our understanding, based on discussions with the
Redesign Team, that the Proposal would limit prehearing conferences to cases where claimants are represented. This
is consistent with Conference recommendations.

3. Consultation With Medical Sources in Appeals 


The Conference believes that improved case development will result from the special responsibilities given to disability
claim managers at the initial decisionmaking level and to prehearing officers at the administrative hearing level.
At the same time, the Conference supports retaining authority for administrative law judges to consult with medical
sources, as needed. The Conference believes that, in doing so, ALJs should follow practices similar to those set out
in Recommendation 8910.

4. Retention of De Novo Hearing With an Administrative Law Judge 


The Conference supports the proposed role for prehearing officers in developing the record as a way to improve the
effectiveness of ALJ decisionmaking. The Conference's recommendations, however, have been predicated on the presumption
that an ALJ would have the ultimate decisionmaking responsibility. Although others may be available to assist, the
ALJ must retain the responsibility for the content and quality of his or her decisions. 



5. Role of the Appeals Council 


The Conference has previously recommended that the Appeals Council role in the disability process be limited.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 The Conference believes that, in reviewing cases, the Council should focus on cases raising precedential questions.
The Conference supports the Proposal's idea of having the Appeals Council also review cases on a random basis, looking
at both grants and denials. The Conference also believes that the Appeals Council should have a role in providing guidance
to decisionmakers at all stages in the claims process, through the use of precedent and interpretive guidelines concerning
adjudicatory principles and decisional standards.

2. Representatives 


The Conference has recommended that claimants be provided information about sources of representation, both attorneys
and nonattorneys.
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 It also has suggested that appropriate standards be adopted concerning proper practice, and that nonattorney representatives
be encouraged.
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 The Redesign Proposal contains similar types of suggestions.

3. Precedent 


The Proposal calls for a single presentation of all substantive policies used for determination of eligibility for
benefits. This is consistent with a number of Conference recommendations that SSA make more use of agency guidance
in disability benefits cases.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 The Conference also recommends use of precedent and clear agency statements of policy to encourage uniform outcomes
among similar cases. The Appeals Council could undertake, as one of its functions, the review of ALJ determinations
for use as precedent.

4. Reopening the Record 



The Proposal implies that the record will be closed at the ALJ level. We support the idea that the record should close
following the ALJ hearing, at a time set by the ALJ, and suggest that this be made explicit. 

The Proposal is silent on the availability of any opportunity to reopen the record following the ALJ hearing. While
the Conference does not generally encourage such reopenings, SSA should consider offering a limited opportunity
to reopen the record in appropriate cases, consistent with Recommendation 904(4), (5).
