FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: KLSE presses Magnum and Dunlop
Estates
THE Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) has once again crossed swords with
Magnum and Dunlop Estates, two listed Malaysian companies which are chasing
potentially highly-lucrative gaming projects in China.
The KLSE has directed each company to submit fortnightly progress reports on
the status of their proposed China ventures. Last September, Magnum and
Dunlop, both part of the Multi-Purpose Holdings group, had announced that
the authorities in China's Guangdong province had approved 'in principle'
the operation of a lottery by the two companies.
Subsequently, the KLSE insisted on more information. Magnum and Dunlop then
said that though Guangdong had approved their project, other 'relevant
authorities' had still to give their endorsement.
