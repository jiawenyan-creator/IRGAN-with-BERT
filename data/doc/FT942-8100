FT  21 MAY 94 / Malawi's new president discusses coalition
Malawi's new president, Mr Bakili Muluzi, conferred yesterday with a
northern-based party on forming a coalition government, Reuter reports from
Lilongwe. Official poll results showed his United Democratic Front could be
five seats short of an overall majority in an enlarged 177-seat national
assembly.
Mr Muluzi has ruled out co-operation with former President Banda's outgoing
Malawi Congress Party.
