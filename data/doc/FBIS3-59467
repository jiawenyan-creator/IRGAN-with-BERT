  [Text] Brussels (from our correspondent) -- Yesterday at 
NATO headquarters, Boris Cizej, Slovene ambassador to Brussels, 
delivered a letter from Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle to NATO 
Secretary General Manfred Woerner, stating that Slovenia wishes 
to be included in the Partnership for Peace. 
  Including Slovenia in the NATO framework would mean 
increasing the distance from the harrowing confines of the 
former Yugoslavia. The administration as well as the parliament 
have already decided in favor of Slovene observer status in the 
North Atlantic Council for Cooperation, in which East and 
Central European countries and the former Warsaw Pact members 
cooperate with NATO. The concept of Partnership for Peace offers 
new opportunities which would eventually pave the way to regular 
NATO membership. This Western military alliance is supposed to 
satisfy two demands: that of the former Warsaw Pact members 
seeking new security assurances and that of Russia opposing NATO 
expansion to its borders.
