FT  22 FEB 94 / Jordan says unions boost productivity
Britain's trade unions are now 'a positive force for change' in making the
country's industry globally competitive, a senior union leader said last
night.
But workers needed the legal right to workplace representation that their
counterparts in Germany and Japan have if industry is to achieve a new
partnership between capital and labour, said Mr Bill Jordan, president of
the AEEU, the country's largest manufacturing union.
'A legal right to representation at the place of work would be a giant step
towards eradicating the British disease instead of just suppressing the
symptoms as successive governments have done. Good legislation is a catalyst
for change,' Mr Jordan said in a speech in London.
He emphasised that this was 'not the same thing as a right to recognition
for unions', while admitting that 'if the British tradition were followed,
it would generally mean representation by a union'.
But if that caused non-union employers to look at the thinking and practice
of modern trade unionism they 'would discover Britain's biggest industrial
world-class companies are overwhelmingly unionised'.
Mr Jordan said unions were good for employers because they helped to raise
productivity through co-operation in flexible working - such as at carmakers
Rover and Toyota - and by the removal of fears among workers.
He stressed the need for unions to drop 'the ideology of confrontation' and
accept that they had 'a shared interest in the success of the company'.
'Unions must be active advocates of the long-term strategy of combining
security with competitiveness,' he said.
