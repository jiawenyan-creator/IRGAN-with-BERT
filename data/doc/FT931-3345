FT  16 MAR 93 / Jury selection in BCCI trial starts
JURY selection began yesterday for the first US court trial in relation to
the Bank of Commerce and Credit International affair since the bank was shut
by international regulators on July 5 1991. Opening arguments at the New
York trial - which involves criminal bribery, fraud and other charges
against Mr Robert Altman, the protege and law partner of former US defence
secretary Clark Clifford - are not expected until next week.
Mr Altman, who was indicted last year along with the 86-year-old Mr
Clifford, will stand trial alone since Mr Clifford's lawyers have asked that
his case be delayed because of his poor health.
The trial stems from BCCI-related charges announced last summer by Mr Robert
Morgenthau, the New York district attorney.
Both Mr Clifford and Mr Altman have denied any wrongdoing in the BCCI
affair.
