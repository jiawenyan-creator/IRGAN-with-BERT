"Swimming Right Up to the City of Serdobsk"] 
  [Excerpts] Penza Oblast -- While spring comes to the city 
of Serdobsk, Penza Oblast -- as prescribed -- once a year, 
floods come far more rarely. And one the like of today's cannot 
be remembered even by the old inhabitants. [passage omitted] 
  The water level in the local Serdoba stream has risen by 
almost eight meters. Whereas just one week ago the stream was 
barely 10 meters wide, it has now spread up to 1 km, submerging 
hundreds of houses in the suburbs of Serdobsk. 
  I later spoke with with Ivan Navalnyy, first deputy head of 
the rayon administration. According to his conservative 
estimate, the flood damage comes to 1 billion rubles. [passage 
omitted] 
  The flooding in Penza Oblast has passed its peak, our 
correspondent Aleksandr Kislov reports. Small rivers reached 
the nine to 10-meter mark. Around 40 population centers are 
surrounded by or under water. There have been casualties. 
  As V. Grinkov, chairman of the oblast flood commission and 
deputy chief of the oblast administration, reported, as of today 
2,600 homes in the area are flooded. The victims are being 
helped and the situation is under control. A week ago alarm was 
caused by the Khoper River: Because its level was lower than 
the Don's the river was flowing backward and flooding the 
district. The high water has now stopped here.
