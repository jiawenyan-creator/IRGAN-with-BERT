IDEAS TO UPGRADE RAIL SERVICE FROM LOS ANGELES TO SAN DIEGO 
The time has come. The expense enormous. Moscow, Paris, Hong Kong, London, 
Tokyo, all have something Southern California lacks: an underground railroad. 
As an independent country, Southern California now ranks as the planet's 
eighth-largest economy, yet its transportation system is a mess. Further growth 
is reined in and choked by its infantile transport system. With 1992 ready to 
impact on the nation's economy, as a united Europe girds up to battle with 
Japan and the U.S.A. for economic supremacy, Orange County is left prostrate 
with a segmented polity unable to cope with the external world's changed 
reality. 
The railroads and interstates forged the American boom years; the waterways 
created a united California. If Southern California is to mature into its licit 
role as world economic leader, then a reformation of its transport is 
mandatory. 
Underground railroad tubes will be built in the Southland. Timing and finances 
are political decisions. The debate and routing of these corridors needs no 
delay. Southern California awaits the political leadership to steer the next 
economic boom of our privileged abode.
