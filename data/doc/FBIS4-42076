<F P=106> [Interview with Oskar Lafontaine, SPD deputy chairman and </F>
Saarland minister-president, by unidentified correspondent; 
place and date not given: "Nothing Is Taboo"] 
  [Text] [DIE ZEIT] Mr. Lafontaine, according to the latest 
revenue estimates there will be some 35 billion German marks 
[DM] missing from the federal budget by 1997. What effect will 
this have on fiscal policy? 
  [Lafontaine] These new figures show that the holes in the 
budget are even bigger than the Federal Government has admitted 
so far. What is particularly worrying is that the spiralling 
debts have led to a dramatic increase in the interest owed. In 
1995, the government will have to spend one German mark in every 
five on interest. This impairs the state's capacity to act. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Finance Minister Theo Waigel has indicated that 
1995 will see zero growth with all expenditure, which means 
clear cuts in real terms. Is this feasible, also with regard to 
social aspects? 
  [Lafontaine] Over the last few years, savings were enforced 
mainly at the expense of the socially weak. It cannot go on 
like this. The finance minister has to present an honest budget 
and a fiscal plan for several years; and then we will see 
whether it meets the economic and social demands. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Will people now have to expect new tax increases, 
because indebtedness would increase even further otherwise? 
  [Lafontaine] In contrast to its promises, the Kohl 
government decided on tax increases totalling DM116 billion 
after the 1990 elections. Indications are that the coalition 
will not shrink from repeating this tax lie. It is planning 
drastic increases in value-added tax and petroleum and property 
taxes. It also wants to introduce toll charges. With an SPD 
[Social Democratic Party of Germany] government, there will be 
no tax increases. 
  [DIE ZEIT] How would an SPD government deal with these 
enormous deficits? 
  [Lafontaine] The consolidation of public finances can only 
succeed, if, by an effective strengthening of the economy, tax 
revenues are increased and the cost of unemployment reduced. As 
soon as the economy begins to pick up, a strict consolidation 
course is absolutely necessary. In this course, we will 
reexamine all public benefits -- including tax and social 
benefits -- at regular intervals. People can be sure that the 
SPD's consolidation program will be balanced in social terms. 
We must, however, create the necessary preconditions to enable 
noticeable tax reductions in the medium term. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Do these circumstances allow a reform-oriented 
policy? 
  [Lafontaine] Thinking that reforms can only be effected by 
increasing expenditure is a misconception. To bring about 
better environmental protection, or equal rights for women and 
men, a rethinking must first of all take place in people's minds.
