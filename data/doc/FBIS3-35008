  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has said that Israel 
views with deep gravity yesterday's katyusha shelling of the 
Galilee. This was a violation of a valid agreement in the 
region, Peres said. The appropriate authorities are now 
checking whether it was an isolated incident, and Israel will 
decide on its moves based on the outcome of the investigation. 
Mr. Peres spoke with correspondents after meeting with 
Portugal's foreign minister. 
  Police Minister Moshe Shahal said that Israel will respond 
with its full might against anybody who harms the Galilee 
residents. Minister Shahal rejected the charges that there was 
an attempt to hide the shelling from the public. He said he is 
convinced that the news was withheld for operational reasons. 
Our correspondent Nati Silberman reports that the police 
minister addressed a ceremony inaugurating a new police station 
in Tirat Karmel.
