FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: Ericsson returns to the black in
quarter
ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, made a SKr422m (Dollars
79.2m) pre-tax profit for the second quarter of the year. This compares with
a SKr363m loss made in the first quarter, caused mainly by cuts in
telecommunications investments in Spain and Mexico.
Over the first half of the year the company achieved a SKr59m pre-tax profit
which compares with the SKr1.775bn profit it made for the same period of
1991.
The company announced a 24 per cent increase in its order bookings for the
first six months to SKr26.77bn from SKr21.55bn although there was a 10 per
cent drop in net sales to SKr20.311bn from SKr22.463bn.
Loss per share after tax and full conversion was SKr1.34 compared with
income per share of SKr5.26 for the first six months of last year.
Ericsson said that its 1992 profit forecast remained unchanged with a weak
profit for the year as a whole.
The company has reduced costs by 8 per cent this year as a result of a
savings programme which has cut 6,000 people from its 70,000-strong
workforce.
