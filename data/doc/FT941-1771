FT  24 MAR 94 / Death of Opus Dei leader
Monsignor Alvaro del Portillo, leader of the Catholic lay organisation Opus
Dei, died yesterday of a heart attack, aged 80. The organisation, which
claims 77,000 members, emphasises church discipline and tradition and has
been accused of secrecy and seeking to wield power. Monsignor Portillo
succeeded Opus Dei's founder, Mr Josemaria Escriva de Balaguer, as head of
the group in 1975. He was ordained a bishop in 1991 by Pope John Paul. Mr
Portillo's successor will be chosen in the coming months by an Opus Dei
congress which will come up with a candidate to submit to the Pope.
