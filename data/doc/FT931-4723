FT  10 MAR 93 / CBI urges labour reviews
THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry said yesterday that more companies
should consider withdrawing from collective bargaining, David Goodhart
writes.
Mr Robbie Gilbert, CBI director of employment affairs, recommends in a paper
on pay setting that companies consider increasing the proportion of
employees on short-term and fixed contracts and locking labour costs into
pay deals of more than one year.
He also says companies should consider withdrawing recognition from trade
unions. After a discussion of single union deals, which he says might soon
be on the increase, Mr Gilbert states: 'But for many (companies), no union
at all may now make more sense'.
The paper says managers are generally unwilling to organise work as they
wish, even though recent surveys have shown that two thirds believe they are
free to do so.
