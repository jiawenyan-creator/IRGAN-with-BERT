YACHTING; 
GRAND ILLUSION WINS IN A BREEZE 
Ed McDowell's patched-up Grand Illusion trailed Mitch Rouse's Taxi Dancer 
around the course without a need to win the heat during Cabrillo Beach Yacht 
Club's Summer Sled Regatta for ultralight 70s at San Pedro Sunday. Taxi Dancer 
had lost a chance at the overall title Saturday when she was disqualified for 
colliding with Grand Illusion in the second race, so it didn't matter that 
Rouse won Sunday by 2 minutes 25 seconds. 
Rouse could easily have absolved the foul in Saturday's race -- in which he was 
second -- by performing a 720-degree penalty, two full circles. Even with the 
penalty, he would have placed high enough for the overall win. 
Sunday's race was sailed in winds to 17 knots on a 23-mile course to Pt. Fermin 
and around the outer harbor. After overnight repairs to her hull, Grand 
Illusion, with Billy Peterson at the helm, had only to beat Bob McNulty's 
Chance and Peter Tong's Blondie. RICH ROBERTS
