FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Asset sales lift Groupe Victoire
Groupe Victoire, the insurance unit of France's Cie de Suez, yesterday
announced a FFr3.53bn (Dollars 612m) group net profit for 1993, up from
FFr214m in 1992, Agencies reports from Paris.
However, excluding exceptional items, net profit dipped to FFr1bn from
FFr1.2bn.
Last year's accounts were distorted by Victoire's sale of most of its
foreign operations to Union des Assurances de Paris, which added a capital
gain of FFr3bn.
This was partly offset by about FFr500m of exceptional losses linked to
Victoire's stake in Gefion, formerly Baltica of Denmark, and a financial
operation in Canada.
Mr Patrick Werner, director-general of Victoire, quashed rumours that it was
being sold. He said the executive board, which met yesterday, did not
discuss this possibility, and 'it won't be on the agenda of the Suez board',
which meets on April 5.
