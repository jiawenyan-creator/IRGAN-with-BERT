TV REVIEW; 
NEO-NAZI DRAMA DEFEATED BY A WEAK SCRIPT 
"So Proudly We Hail" is billed as a movie about the rise of neo-Nazism in the 
United States. However real that threat, this story lacks a script and 
characters credible enough to make it come alive on the screen. 
It airs at 9 tonight on CBS (Channels 2 and 8). 
Writer-director-executive producer Lionel Chetwynd creates parallel stories -- 
one involving anthropology professor James Wagner (Edward Herrmann) and another 
involving three young drifters (Chad Lowe, Billy Morrissette and Peter Dobson) 
-- and then merges them as these characters become human chess pieces 
manipulated by white supremacist Alden Ernst (David Soul) and his smirking 
nephew (Raphael Sbarge). 
Chetwynd has shaped these casualties to fit his apparent thesis that the new 
Nazi leadership is smooth and shrewd enough to victimize and exploit discontent 
in a broad cross section of Americans, ranging from the uneducated to liberal 
intellectuals like Wagner. It's something to think about. 
However, everything and everyone here -- including the soft-headed media -- are 
almost comically obvious. The victims are script-serving setups, the least 
believable of whom is Wagner, an incredibly naive boob who so easily falls prey 
to Ernst and his Nazi temptress cohort (Harley Jane Kozak) that he appears 
brain dead. 
By trivializing Wagner, the story trivializes the danger. Equally injurious are 
such fanciful sidebars as Ernst's girlfriend -- whose Nazi sympathies seems 
obvious to everyone but Wagner -- being able to plant the simpleton professor 
on a prestigious network show patterned after "Nightline." As he is being 
interviewed, she is given the run of the control room like an insider. 
The performances are perfunctory, the direction without dramatic edge and the 
story lacking in anything that hasn't been said before -- and said better.
