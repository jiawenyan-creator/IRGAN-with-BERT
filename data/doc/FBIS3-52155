  [Text] New Delhi regretted the rejection of its request by 
the Belgian Government for the extradition of the JKLF [Jammu 
Kashmir Liberation Front] leader, Amanullah Khan, to India. 
Talking to newspersons, the spokesman of the External Affairs 
Ministry said that the government of India had provided 
comprehensive details to the government of Belgium. The case 
was presented in the court by the public prosecutor of that 
country. The spokesman observed that the decision is not based 
on the facts of the case but on political and extremist 
consideration. 
  Replying to another question on the forthcoming 
Indo-Pakistan 
foreign secretary level talks, the spokesman said India has 
adopted a realistic approach and is going for the talks to 
Islamabad with a lot of hopes. He said the government of India 
has noted certain reports appearing in the Pakistani press and 
has preferred to ignore them.
