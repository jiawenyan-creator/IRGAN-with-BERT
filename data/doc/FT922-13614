FT  10 APR 92 / Labour's swing in the south falters
EARLY results suggested Labour was failing to achieve the predicted swing in
the south of England outside London despite the effects of recession.
By 1am it was expected Labour might take only three of its nine main targets
in the south-east.
The first signs of setbacks came in Basildon where Labour managed only a 1.5
per cent swing against the Tories with the re-election of Mr David Amess.
The Essex marginal was 31st on Labour's hit list of seats it needed to win
to form the next government.
The signs were that Labour proposals to raise income tax for the top 10 per
cent of earners may have cost it dear in an area of above average affluence.
In the hard-hit area of Portsmouth South, where unemployment has risen
steeply, the vote was so close that the returning officer ordered a second
recount. The Conservatives held on with a majority of 242 even though the
seat had headed the Liberal Democrat target list. In Guildford there was
scarcely any movement in the vote as Mr David Howell retained his seat with
a 13,404 majority.
Mr Rupert Allason retained Torbay, the second result to be declared, with
only a 2 per cent swing against him.
As the results came in the swing became more patchy. In Exeter there was an
8 per cent swing to Labour and at Faversham, 3 per cent.
But although Labour was achieving larger swings in northern and Midlands
marginals than in the Tory heartland of the south early London results were
disappointing.
Mr David Mellor increased his majority in Putney and Mr John Bowis held
Battersea for the Tories even though a swing of less than 1 per cent would
have unseated him.
