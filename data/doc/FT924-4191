FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: Zurich banking executive to quit
at year end
MR ALFRED HARTMANN, deputy chairman of the troubled Rothschild Bank in
Zurich, is resigning at the end of the year.
His resignation follows revelations that the bank made loans of SFr220m
(Dollars 155m) which broke Swiss banking law. He has also resigned from the
boards of five other Rothschild companies in Switzerland.
No reason for the resignation was given.
Mr Hartmann has been involved with other troubled banks. He was a director
of the defunct Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) and chairman
of its Swiss associate, Banque de Commerce et Placements (BCP), which was
named in the first US indictment in 1988 of BCCI's money laundering
activities in Florida.
He was widely criticised last year for his failure to spot trouble early on
at BCCI.
