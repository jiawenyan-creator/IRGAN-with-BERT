BRIEFLY 
Checchi Provides DOT Information: Los Angeles financier Alfred A. Checchi gave 
the Department of Transportation more detailed information about his purchase 
of Northwest Airlines but said he would need a few more days to pull together 
all the documents requested. The department, which is reviewing the 
transaction, asked for cash-flow statements, labor contracts, growth 
projections and business plans. Meanwhile, Checchi's representatives are to 
meet today with Kenneth Quinn, DOT legal counsel and members of the 
department's policy staff.
