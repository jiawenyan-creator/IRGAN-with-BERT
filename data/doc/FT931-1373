FT  25 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Clinton attack on access rejected
JAPAN hit back yesterday against strong criticism of its trading practices
by President Bill Clinton.
The US leader's statement on Tuesday that the prospect of gaining fair
access to the Japanese market was 'somewhat remote' was based on a
misunderstanding of that market, said Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister
for international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry.
'Japan was the largest market for US agricultural products and the second
largest for US manufactured goods. If Japanese markets were really difficult
to access, this could not be the case,' he said.
Japan's imports from the US had increased in value from Dollars 48.2bn in
1989 to Dollars 52.1bn last year. It was not appropriate to compare Japan's
trade surplus with others. Japan was more competitive, he said.
The minister repeated Tokyo's rejection it should set market share targets
as a measurement of access. 'We are working in a free market which cannot be
changed by artificial means,' he said.
Japan believed the US-Japan trade balance should be improved through efforts
to cut the US budget deficit and raise US competitiveness.
