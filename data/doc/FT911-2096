FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Spanish utilities agree merger
HIDROLA and Iberduero, Spain's two largest private sector electricity
utilities, formally agreed last night to begin merging. They will create a
new holding company to look at intergrating their generating and
distribution assets.
The new company, HI Holdings, will eventually become the parent of both
companies, Hidrola said.
The two companies account for some 30 per cent of Spanish generating
capacity and are valued at more than Dollars 5bn on the Madrid stock market.
The decision has been taken in the face of government concern that Iberduero
and Hidrola together will control the bulk of Spain's hydro-electrical
capacity.
The government, however, is unlikely to prevent a full merger going ahead.
Madrid has told utilities it wants to restructure totally the electrical
sector this year, to create larger and more competitive generators.
The private companies have been desperately looking for ways to ally with
each other to avoid merging with Endesa, the state-owned utility, which
Madrid wants to see emerge as one of the two or three leaders of a
reorganised sector.
Hidrola and Iberduero have been helped in moving towards a merger by their
large banking shareholders, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and Banesto, who, besides
owning small stakes in the companies, can control up to 30 per cent of votes
at shareholder meetings.
