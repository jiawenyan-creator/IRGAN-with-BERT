FT  01 DEC 92 / Hurd pledges to stand his ground on rebate
THE UK yesterday rejected all attempts to reduce its European Community
budget rebate, negotiated in 1984, and made clear that was one subject on
which it was not prepared to compromise in the run-up to the EC summit in
Edinburgh next week, writes Robert Mauthner.
'The abatement (worth about Pounds 2bn a year) is not an act of charity to
Britain,' Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said at a foreign
correspondents' lunch in London. 'It is the best answer yet designed to deal
with the problem that the Community budget does not operate on a rational
basis.'
Mr Hurd described the net distribution of revenue and expenditure in the
Community as 'irrational.' The budget still distributed resources from the
UK to richer countries. Agreement on this problem required unanimity, the
foreign secretary stressed. 'There is no prospect of unanimity on any
proposal which challenges the abatement.'
Countering the arguments of 'Eurosceptics', Mr Hurd emphasised that every
'serious' British commentator saw Britain's future in Europe.
'If we want to keep our influence we must ratify.' The Maastricht treaty was
the only attainable framework for the EC's development over the next four or
five years.
