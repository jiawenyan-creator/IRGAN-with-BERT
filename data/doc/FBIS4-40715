  [Text] Chernobyl, [No dateline as received] -- During the 
night of 16-17 June the trans-shipment of the exhausted nuclear 
fuel from the basin of the second power unit at the Chernobyl 
nuclear power station -- caused by an increased water leakage 
spotted by the station's personnel on 7 June -- was completed. 
This was reported to Ukraine's Ministry of the Environment, the 
State Committee for the Use of Nuclear Power, and the State 
Committee for Nuclear and Radiation Safety. 
  "The leakage in the basin had been registered for a long 
period of time," Viktor Vasylchenko, chief engineer of the 
"CHAES" production association said during his conversation with 
a UNIAN correspondent. "Besides, the operation of the second 
power unit is now being discontinued. The standard systems 
diverted the leakages to the capacities, specially designed for 
this purpose. There was no aggravation of the radiation 
situation on the territory of the Chernobyl nuclear power 
station and, moreover, there was no contamination of the 
environment, as certain mass media assumed, and there could be 
none -- the situation is fully under control." 
  According to Vasylchenko, a periodic servicing of the 
exhausted nuclear fuel decay basin, envisaged in such cases, got 
under way on 17 June.
