  [Text] Ho Chong-man, responsible vice chairman of Chongnyon 
[the General Association of Koreans Residing in Japan] Central 
Standing Committee, made a speech after being invited to the 
general meeting of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDJP] 
Japan-DPRK Committee and to the bull session of Japan-DPRK 
issues on 5 April. 
  He first of all he notified that the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il is very healthy [maeu konganghasida] and that he is 
wisely leading the overall socialist construction. 
  While making a remark on the current situation surrounding 
the nuclear issue, he said that the 25 February agreement 
adopted at the DPRK-U.S. New York contact and the 15 February 
agreement reached between the International Atomic Energy Agency 
and the Republic were overturned, and that the situation on the 
Korean peninsula is heading toward the brink of war. He pointed 
out that the one wholly responsible for this is the United 
States. 
  He said that the statement by the president of the UN 
Security Council is another international commotion to put 
pressure on the republic. He emphasized that by no means can 
the issue be resolved through this kind of threat and pressure. 
  He said that the nuclear issue must be resolved in a fair 
way 
in accordance with the special position in which the republic 
has temporarily suspended to take effect the withdrawal from the 
nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. He expressed the position that 
the SDPJ will play a positive role in resolving the nuclear 
issue in a fair way.
