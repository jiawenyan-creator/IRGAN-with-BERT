ACTION:

 Notice of final rulemaking (NFRM). 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is finalizing the approval of revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the 

Federal Register

 on December 20, 1993. The revisions concern rules from the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD).
This approval action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving
these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of
the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The revised rules control VOC emissions from hospital sterilizers
and petroleum production, processing, storage, and transfer. Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of these revisions
into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary
and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.

Background 



On December 20, 1993 in 58 FR 66324, EPA proposed to approve the following VCAPCD rules into the California SIP: Rule
62.6, Ethylene Oxide-Sterilization and Aeration; Rule 71.1, Crude Oil Production and Separation; and Rule 71.3,
Transfer of Reactive Organic Compound Liquids. These rules were adopted by VCAPCD on July 16, 1991 and June 16, 1992.
The rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on October 25, 1991 and September 14, 1992.
These rules were submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment
areas fix their reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that
interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act. A detailed discussion of the background for each of the above
rules and nonattainment areas is provided in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) cited above. 


EPA has evaluated all of the above rules for consistency with the requirements of the CAA, EPA regulations, and EPA
interpretation of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the
NPRM cited above. EPA has found that the rules meet the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule
provisions and evaluations has been provided in 58 FR 66324 and in technical support documents (TSDs) available at
EPA's Region IX office. 



Response to Public Comments 



A 30-day public comment period was provided in 58 FR 66324. EPA received no comments regarding the NPRM. 



EPA Action 



EPA is finalizing this action to approve the above rules for inclusion into the California SIP. EPA is approving the
submittal under section 110(k)(3) as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and Part D of the CAA. This approval
action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules
is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the CAA. 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements. 



Regulatory Process 



This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 22142225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted this regulatory
action from Executive Order 12866 review.
