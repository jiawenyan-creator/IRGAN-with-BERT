WORLD; 
BUSH, MUBARAK TO MEET ON PEACE 
President Bush and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will review Middle East 
peace prospects for the third time this year at a White House meeting on Oct. 
2, the White House said today. 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who described the Egyptian leader as 
"an old and respected friend," said the session is not directly related to 
Mubarak's efforts to devise a plan for elections in the Israeli-occupied West 
Bank and Gaza. 
He said he does not know the specific agenda for the talks, but added: "I'm 
sure they'll discuss the peace process."
