<F P=106> [John Carvel report: "Government to Concede to EU on </F>
Part-Time Worker Protection"] 
  [Text] The Government is understood to be preparing to 
compromise with European Union [EU] demands that part-time 
workers in Britain be given better protection. 
  Ministers are still not willing to provoke a Tory rebellion 
by bringing forward social legislation to implement EU proposals. 
  But EU officials suggested last night that Britain will 
shortly respond to a German demand that employment protection no 
longer be limited to those in full-time work. 
  A deal is expected during a German ministerial visit to 
London in the next few weeks. 
  Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, said the 12 
employment ministers indicated at a council meeting in 
Luxembourg yesterday that this proposal should not be switched 
to the Maastricht social protocol track, which allows the 11 
other member states to proceed without Britain. "The Germans 
said the measure would be a high priority during their EU 
presidency (which starts in July). It requires unanimity in the 
council," Mr Flynn said. 
  He hinted, however, that he may switch two other draft 
directives to the social protocol track to bypass British 
opposition: a statutory right to substantial paternity leave; 
and allowing parents absence from work for family reasons. The 
second would shift the burden of proof in disputed cases in 
favour of the employee. 
  "I must reflect on how to proceed, bearing in mind the 
social 
protocol," Mr Flynn said. 
  He spoke after the first item under the Maastricht protocol 
started its way through the social affairs council. British 
ministers will not be allowed to vote or speak as other member 
state ministers discuss legislation to give multinationals' 
workers the right to consultation on takeovers, redundancies, 
and shifts of production between countries.
