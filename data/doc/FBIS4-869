  [Text] This morning, four local opposition officials 
including a national deputy were arrested in Maine-Soroa, Diffa 
Department. According to Henri Ibrahim, prefect of the 
department, the four were arrested for inciting people to 
violence and tribal hatred. They are presently detained at the 
Diffa Gendarmerie Brigade headquarters. They had planned to 
attack the Maine-Soroa Subprefecture, to abduct the subprefect, 
and to demand the release of Tandja Mamadou, chairman of the 
National Movement of the Development Society-Nassara. The 
regional authorities, who were alerted, foiled the plot by 
arresting the ringleaders. 
  A report we have just received says that in order to 
maintain 
social peace, the Diffa authorities have, as of today, banned 
all public gatherings and demonstrations until further notice.
