FT  07 JUL 92 / Scottish &amp; Newcastle rises to Pounds 221m
SCOTTISH &amp; Newcastle, the brewing, pubs and leisure group, benefited from
the turmoil in the beer market and increased pre-tax profits from Pounds
216.8m to Pounds 221.1m in the 53 weeks ended May 3. The shares rose 3p to
463p.
Mr Brian Stewart, chief executive, said the brewing side increased market
share, although volumes were down 0.6 per cent against a market fall of 5
per cent. S&amp;N had yet to see 'any sustained signs of economic recovery', he
said.
Mr Stewart said there were 'a lot of changes going on in the market, which
have been exacerbated by the (government's) beer orders'. The beer orders
forced brewers with more than 2,000 pubs to sell outlets but S&amp;N, with
around 1,900 pubs, was not affected.
Group sales rose 8 per cent to Pounds 1.49bn, and operating profits rose 5.7
per cent to Pounds 239.1m. Operating profits from the beer division
increased 3 per cent to Pounds 99m, in spite of a rise in bad debts from
Pounds 5.5m to Pounds 12.6m. Mr Stewart said that excluding the debts the
division's margins were maintained.
The retail side increased profits 3 per cent to Pounds 57m, helped by the
inclusion of 30 pubs acquired last October.
Profits from selling some pubs dipped from Pounds 9.2m to Pounds 8.5m. Mr
Stewart was confident the value of the group's properties exceeded book
value.
Leisure, which includes the Center Parcs and Pontin's holiday locations,
raised profits 14 per cent to Pounds 74.6m, mainly because of strong growth
at Center Parcs which achieved 95 per cent occupancy rates.
Another Center Parc location was under construction in France.
Investment income rose to Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 3.9m) but interest payable
also increased to Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 13.3m) - Pounds 7m of the rise came
from the purchase of the minority of Center Parcs last year.
Tax rate fell from 32 per cent to 29 per cent, a trend which Mr Stewart
hoped would continue. Earnings per share rose to 36.4p (34.1p), and a final
dividend of 10.59p gives a total of 16.1p (15p).
Capital expenditure totalled Pounds 154m and led to a small increase in net
debt to Pounds 307.3m (Pounds 296m), equal to 23.1 per cent of shareholders
funds.
