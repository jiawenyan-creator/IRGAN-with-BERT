A stock car driver involved in a crash Saturday night at Saugus Speedway said 
that he deliberately made contact with the other car involved as a retaliatory 
measure. 
Richard DeLong Sr., 52, of Castaic, who was involved in a fiery crash with 
Chuck Pittenger, 44, of Northridge, said he attempted to "spin out" Pittenger 
during the 15-lap semi-main event. DeLong claimed that Pittenger had caused him 
to spin out two laps earlier. 
"Oh, I took him out," DeLong said. "I just wanted to give him back what he gave 
me. I figured, if I can't finish the race, then neither is he." 
As both cars slammed into the wall, DeLong's vaulted over Pittenger's and 
landed atop the wall on its left side. Spectators in the grandstands scurried 
from the scene as Pittenger, who walked away unhurt, leaped from his burning 
vehicle. 
DeLong suffered a broken left foot and minor burns. NASCAR officials are 
reviewing the incident.
