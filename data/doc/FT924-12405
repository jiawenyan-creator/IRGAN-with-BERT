FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Esselte back in the black
ESSELTE, the Swedish office equipment group, returned to profit in the first
eight months, as tighter cost control more than offset the impact of
depressed markets.
The group reported income after financial items of SKr81m (Dollars 14m),
compared with a SKr117m loss a year ago.
Sales fell 14 per cent to SKr8.64bn, although in underlying terms the drop
was just 6 per cent.
