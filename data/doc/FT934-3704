FT  08 DEC 93 / Banda takes back power
President Hastings Banda resumed executive power in Malawi yesterday, in an
apparent move to restore order after an army crackdown on Malawi Young
Pioneers, the armed wing of the ruling Congress party, Nick Young writes
from Lilongwe.
Government and party premises were attacked during the crackdown. Opposition
leaders doubt Dr Banda's ability to govern after a brain operation and a
two-month convalescence, during which power passed to a Congress party
triumvirate.
