  [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the 
Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland 
Sunday issued its information No. 649 condemning the South 
Korean puppet clique for outrageous suppression of workers' 
strike for wage hike and right to existence. 
  According to the information, the Kim Yong-sam group sent 
combat police to a rally of workers observing May Day to block 
up streets and square. 
  They also kicked up a row of search for the leading forces 
after the rally and arrested scores of people in a few days. 
  "This suppression followed the instructions of traitor Kim 
Yong-sam, who said he would make this year `a year with no 
dispute between labour and management', to take a `strong 
counteraction' by `law' against the workers' strikes, legal or 
illegal, small or big," the information notes, and goes on: 
  The Kim Yong-sam group's clamour for "building of a society 
for workers in a sweat" or "triunity" is a sheer deceptive 
propaganda. 
  South Korean workers, expecting nothing from the Kim 
Yong-sam 
"government", should more vigorously turn out in the struggle 
against the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime to retake the right to 
existence and establish a true democratic government, 
strengthening regional and sectional relations, firmly united 
around an independent, democratic trade union.
