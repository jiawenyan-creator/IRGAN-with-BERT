CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; 
GARDENS; 
YEAR-ROUND SEEDS 
LOVERS OF HOME-GROWN vegetables who failed to get around to gardening last 
summer need not throw in the trowel; after all, our Southern California climate 
is perfect for year-round growing. A number of vegetables flourish in the 
cooler weather and shorter days that are upon us. 
And the Abundant Life Seed Foundation can help the cause, with seeds capable of 
producing a simple vegetable patch or a state-of-the-art garden -- by virtue of 
the firm's mail-order catalogue or its retail outlets in the area. 
Among the many vegetables that flourish this time of the year are lettuces such 
as Winter Marvel, All Year Round and Brune d'Hiver (Brown Winter); red orach 
and green orach, mountain spinaches; Oriental greens such as bok choy and 
Japanese mizuna; and others including scallions, carrots, parsley and basil. 
Equally perfect for fall and winter planting are Swiss chard, collards, corn 
salad (a European green resembling a midget lettuce), cress and kale. All of 
the seeds are fungicide-free and open-pollinated (non-hybrid), and many are 
grown organically. Abundant Life Foundation seeds also include herbs, small 
grains, trees, shrubs, flowers and edible seeds. 
The Foundation offers a large selection of books and cassettes on natural 
farming and operates the World Seed Fund, a program that provides free seeds to 
gardeners and farmers in developing nations.
