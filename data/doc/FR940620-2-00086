of Transportation's Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR Part 107, Subpart B), notice is hereby given that the
Office of Hazardous Materials Safety has received the applications described herein. This notice is abbreviated
to expedite docketing and public notice. Because the sections affected, modes of transportation, and the nature
of application have been shown in earlier Federal Register publications, they are not repeated here. Requests for
modifications of exemptions (e.g. to provide for additional hazardous materials, packaging design changes, additional
mode of transportation, etc.) are described in footnotes to the application number. Application numbers with the
suffix ``X'' denote a modification request. Application numbers with the suffix ``P'' denote a party to request.
These applications have been separated from the new applications for exemptions to facilitate processing.
