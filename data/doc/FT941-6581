FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Success in UK helps Sema increase to Pounds
24.9m
Sema Group, the Anglo-French information systems company, yesterday
announced a 28 per cent increase in pre-tax profit from Pounds 19.5m to
Pounds 24.9m for the year ended December 31 1993.
Turnover increased by 20 per cent to Pounds 502m (Pounds 417m), the first
time the company has broached the psychologically significant Pounds 0.5bn
barrier, whileearnings per share rose 26 per cent to 16.6p (13.2p). The
dividend is raised 10 per cent to 3.1p. The share price moved up 9p to 373p.
The company has net cash of Pounds 18.2m, compared with Pounds 5.5m. The
book to bill ratio, the ratio between order intake and turnover, is now
1.11, slightly ahead of last year's 1.09.
The results include the effect of last year's Pounds 20m acquisition of the
Swedish company SKDforetagen.
Sema is a broad-based computer services company specialising in systems
integration - taking prime contract role in the construction of complex
computer systems for large customers at fixed prices - and in facilities
management and outsourcing.
The company is active principally in France where revenues grew 11.4 per
cent to Pounds 170.3 and in the UK where growth of 23.2 per cent to Pounds
212.1m was recorded. It was the company's most successful year in the UK
since CAP and Sema Metra merged in 1988. Mr Pierre Bonelli, Sema chairman,
said it was the result of strong growth in outsourcing - running customers'
data processing on their behalf.
COMMENT
Sema has yet to come close to fulfilling its 1989 strategic aim of of a
60:25:15 revenue split between systems integration, facilities management
and products. Nevertheless, its strength in its key applications areas of
energy, representing 57.6 per cent of sales, transport (43.1 per cent) and
defence (28.4 per cent) more than make up for its problems with I-Linie, the
industrial management package it is developing with IBM. It is however
spending perhaps as much as half of its Pounds 14.6m research and
development budget on the package business. Building a successful packages
business would ice a rich cake. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 33m look likely
this year giving earnings of 20.2p. The prospective p/e of 18.5 is
relatively pricey but Sema offers stability and growth in a sector notorious
for nasty surprises.
