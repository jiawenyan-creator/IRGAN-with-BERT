ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; 
THIEVES GET CAMERA, CAMERA GETS THEM 
A hidden video camera in an automatic teller machine was stolen by two men -- 
while it took pictures of them. 
And police have the film. 
Newport Beach Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said the thieves pried off the sides of 
the ATM outside Great American Bank, 301 Marine Ave., on Balboa Island, and 
ripped away a light panel Wednesday evening to get the the camera. The cameras 
are installed in some ATMs to deter robbery. 
But the film is stored in a separate unit, which the thieves left behind. And 
now officers, armed with the photographs, are searching for suspects. 
Gonis said the thieves caused $300 in damage, and escaped with the camera, 
valued at $1,000.
