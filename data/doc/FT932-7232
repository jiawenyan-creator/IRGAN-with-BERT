FT  25 MAY 93 / Observer: Willy's final Claes act
What have Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign minister, and Sir Edward Heath,
father of the House of Commons, got in common apart from an enthusiasm for
the European ideal? They both like conducting orchestras almost as much as
orchestrating their fellow politicians' agendas.
Indeed, Claes is looking forward to Belgium's presidency of the European
Community, which begins on July 1, with a mixture of optimism and sadness.
Optimism, because last week's Danish and British votes in favour of the
Maastricht treaty have given the drive towards European union new impetus.
Sadness, because for six months Claes will be out of action as a conductor.
Claes has made quite a name for himself as a guest conductor of orchestras
worldwide. On an official visit to the Middle East in December, the
54-year-old Flemish socialist caused quite a stir by conducting the
Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra with one hand, while condemning Israel's
deportation of 400 alleged Muslim fundamentalists with the other.
Aides say conducting is the only activity Claes has time for outside his
ministerial duties and the minister's Brussels office features an elaborate
hi-fi system. Sadly, Claes conducts his last concert next month for Belgian
television and then will have to content himself with trying to keep the 12
member states in tune.
Come December, however, the Community baton will be passed on to the Greeks
and Claes will be free to remount the podium: he's already fixed up three
concerts with the Liege opera orchestra and is open to further offers.
