FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Sheridan does it from prison - Ballot Box
There will not be a news conference to match that being staged on Monday by
Tommy Sheridan, the anti-poll tax campaigner standing for Glasgow Pollok.
Sheridan is holding it inside Saughton prison, Edinburgh, where he is
serving six months for breaching a court order.
The Representation of the People Act obliges the prison to give
parliamentary candidates in jail the same facilities as any other candidate,
so the TV cameras will be allowed in. Sheridan is also allowed to use a
mobile telephone and has some access to the prison fax machine to issue his
manifesto, which boasts of his record of 'standing up for the poor.' His
election agent is able to visit him in prison as often as he wants.
Sheridan is standing for Scottish Militant Labour, an offshoot of Militant,
and his backers say they are making headway in the bleak housing estates of
the safe Labour seat on the south side of Glasgow.
The 27-year-old candidate was jailed for breaching a court order banning him
from disrupting warrant sales - sales of the possessions of those who had
not paid the poll tax.
The last person to stand for parliament from prison, in 1981, was Bobby
Sands, the IRA hunger striker. Sheridan's supporters prefer the example of
John MacLean, a Red Clydesider who stood from Peterhead prison in 1918.
