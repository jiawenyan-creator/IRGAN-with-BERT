FT  23 NOV 94 / Dollars 1.25bn haul for '103'
Mr John Garamendi, California's insurance commissioner, yesterday ordered 28
insurance companies to repay Dollars 1.25bn of premiums between them to
policyholders in the state.
His decision marks the latest stage in the saga of Proposition 103, a voter
initiative in California which won support in 1988. This required insurers
to 'roll back' premium levels and pay rebates to holders of auto and other
insurance policies in 1989.
Mr Garamendi made his first order for rebates in October 1991, when he told
14 insurers to repay Dollars 1.5bn. After protracted court battles Dollars
800m of this has been paid.
The latest rebates include Fireman's Fund, told to repay Dollars 162m;
Hartford Fire &amp; Casualty, Dollars 153m; Chubb, Dollars 139m and Nationwide,
Dollars 93m.
