BRIEFCASE 
David Bretoi, one of the first thrift executives tapped to help regulators run 
failed savings and loans, has co-founded the Lighthouse Management Group in 
Brea to advise regulators and financial institutions. 
Bretoi is president of the Lighthouse group and John L. Carr, now running 
Gibraltar Savings for regulators, is chairman. The two men recently bought the 
firm, called FN Venture Corp., from its parent, First Nationwide Savings Bank 
in San Francisco. 
Bretoi had been president of FN Venture since April, 1985, when he led a First 
Nationwide management team hired by federal regulators to operate Beverly Hills 
Savings &amp; Loan in Mission Viejo. Beverly Hills Savings was the first 
S&amp;L seized and kept open by regulators under its so-called management 
consignment program, and Bretoi stayed until the S&amp;L was sold at the end of 
last year to Michigan National Corp., a bank holding company outside Detroit. 
During his absence, First Nationwide was bought by Ford Motor Co. and his boss, 
Anthony M. Frank, left to become the U.S. postmaster general.
