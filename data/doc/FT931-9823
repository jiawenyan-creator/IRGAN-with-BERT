FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Westpac stake disposal ends
cross-shareholdings
WESTPAC Banking Corporation yesterday pulled out of the last of its
significant cross-shareholdings with Australian banking colleagues when it
sold a 5.6 per cent stake in Perth-based Challenge Bank for about ADollars
15m (USDollars 10m).
This followed Monday's sale of Westpac's shareholdings in both the ANZ
Banking Group and the Bank of Melbourne for a total of about ADollars 260m.
The sales are part of an asset disposal programme.
FAI Insurances, the financial services group, cut its after-tax loss from
ADollars 17.2m to ADollars 6.5m in the December half on a marginal revenue
rise from ADollars 513.5m to ADollars 521.8m.
FAI said the result reflected a reduction in underwriting loss from ADollars
49.8m to ADollars 21.8m. It forecast a small loss for the full year to June,
1993.
