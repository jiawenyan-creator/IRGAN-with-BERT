BRIEFLY 
Opec Metting Called Possible: A top official of Indonesia, one of the more 
moderate members of OPEC, said it was possible the cartel might hold an 
emergency meeting because of plunging oil prices. 
" I don't rule out the possibility of such a meeting, but I am not proposing 
it" said Ginanjar Kartasamita, mines and energy minister. " I am not a 
supporter, but I won't be the one to prevent it." Oil prices have tumbled 
because several members of the Organiztion of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
have been slow to implement cuts pledged early last month.
