  [Text] Kiev March 21 TASS -- Ukrainian Deputy Prime 
Minister Valeriy Shmarov accused Russia on Monday of failing to 
follow trilateral accords reached at a Moscow summit, and 
threatened his country might suspend fulfilling obligations 
under the agreement signed by the presidents of Russia, Ukraine 
and the USA. 
  Under the agreement Ukraine was to receive nuclear fuel in 
exchange for giving up its nuclear warheads. 
  Whereas Ukraine is abiding by the accord "it cannot be said 
the same about Russia", Shmarov told a news conference after a 
meeting with U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry. 
  Ukraine has already dispatched two trainloads of warheads 
but 
"there is no adequate steps from Russia". Ukraine has got 
nothing in response so far, Shmarov stressed. 
  According to him, Russia has not supplied a single lot of 
nuclear fuel, complaining in turn that the USA was failing to 
abide by the accord under which it was to pay Russia 60 million 
dollars. 
  Shmarov said Russian leadership had promised to "straighten 
things out". But the political tension in Ukraine grows and it 
might, as a result, suspend fulfilling its obligations under the 
trilateral agreement, he said.
