  [Text] Related to President Bill Clinton's announcement 
made in the U.S. Congress on 14 March with respect to the 
extension of the moratorium on nuclear tests until September 
1995, Mr. Mircea Geoana, spokesman of the Romanian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, today declared the following: 
  Romania salutes the decision that encourages the achievement 
of the goals of non-proliferation -- above all, the 
unconditioned prolongation over an indefinite period of time of 
the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons -- as 
well as the negotiations currently taking place at the Geneva 
disarmament conference on a total ban on nuclear tests. 
  We express our hope that in concordance with the efforts 
made 
by the international community to strengthen the current 
juridical instruments and institutions set up to prevent the 
spreading of mass destruction weapons, all other nuclear powers 
will take measures similar to those adopted by the U.S. party, 
the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
