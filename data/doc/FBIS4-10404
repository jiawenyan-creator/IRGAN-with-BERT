  [Text] The 31 governors and cabinet members met with 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in Los Pinos today. The 
Presidency Press Office said that the purpose of the meeting was 
to analyze and evaluate priority projects to be implemented this 
year. 
  Unusual movement has been noticed in Los Pinos since 1800. 
Governors arrived practically at the same time, which caused a 
traffic congestion. Some of the secretaries of state had to 
walk to the entrance of the Presidency. 
  The Presidency Press Office did not say if the meeting was 
included on the president's agenda. A bulletin was issued 
later, in which some of the topics discussed were mentioned. 
According to the Media Directorate, Government Secretary Jorge 
Carpizo talked about the electoral reforms for the 21 August 
elections; the finance secretary presented a report on the 
country's current economic situation; the secretary of commerce 
mentioned a price reduction on some staple products; Secretary 
of Social Development Carlos Rojas discussed social matters; 
Secretary of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources Carlos Hank 
Gonzalez reported on checks delivered to peasants; and Secretary 
of Labor Arsenio Farell mentioned aspects of a training program 
he is currently implementing. 
  Governors left the Los Pinos official residence at 2100, 
while the secretaries of state stayed behind. None made any 
statements to the media.
