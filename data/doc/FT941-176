FT  31 MAR 94 / Employee company ownership rules eased
The number of companies owned by their employees through Employee Share
Ownership Plans (Esops), which give tax incentives for employee ownership,
is set to rise substantially after a technical change announced in the
finance bill earlier this week.
There are only two statutory Esops, created under the rules of the 1989
Finance Act. But there are about 50 'case law' Esops, set up outside the
terms of the act, which are simpler but less tax-efficient.
The Esop Centre, a lobby group, believes the total could now rise to about
500. The change removes the obligation for most of the trustees of statutory
Esops to be employees. This has been one of the main disincentives as
trustees are not protected from financial liability if a company fails.
The amendment, moved by Tory MP Mr Ian Taylor, was first floated in the Esop
Centre's Ten Point Plan for boosting the appeal of Esops. Mr Malcolm
Hurlston, the Centre's chairman, said: 'This change opens the door into the
workplace for statutory Esops. I am pleased that the government has given
new support to the Esop.'
