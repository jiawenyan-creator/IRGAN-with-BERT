FT  18 MAY 92 / Letter: Backing for civil servants as non-executive
directors (1)
Sir Mr Elyan's understanding of non-executive directorships (Letters, May
15) is regrettably limited. The government encourages its senior staff to
take non-executive directorships with major companies. We need productive
interchange of ideas and experience. It is essential for senior civil
servants to understand the needs of business and the context in which it
works, just as business needs an insight into workings of government.
Each appointment is carefully vetted to ensure that there are not conflicts
between the company and the civil servant's official duties. None of the
officials in this department who is a non-executive director receives a fee.
Where a fee is paid it passes via this department to the exchequer.
