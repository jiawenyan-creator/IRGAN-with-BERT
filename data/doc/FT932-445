FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Scargill claims British Coal's pits
need not be closed
MR SCARGILL yesterday claimed that all of British Coal's pits could remain
open for the next 20 years if the money spent on redundancies and colliery
closures had been invested in the industry.
The National Union of Mineworkers' president said care and maintenance costs
at pits where production has ended, coupled with payment of wages to miners
'prevented' from cutting coal, has cost Pounds 450m since last October.
'If this sum together with Pounds 1bn earmarked by Michael Heseltine for
redundancies had been made available to the coal industry to preserve rather
than destroy jobs, it would ensure that all of British Coal's 51 pits remain
open for the next 20 years,' Mr Scargill said.
