THE SENSITIVE ISSUE OF BRESLIN'S REMARKS 
While finding Breslin's remarks offensive, I think I'm equally offended by 
those that defend him. I'm referring to his editors. They are quoted as saying, 
he was "guilty of atrocious judgment, but was neither racist nor sexist." 
What do these editors think racist and sexist means? 
(Editor) Don Forst remarked in reference to the reaction of employees, "They 
(the protesting reporters) had come to the aid station seeking morphine for the 
wound they felt had been inflicted on them, and we were saying the wound wasn't 
that serious or grievous. In our view it required aspirin." It is not 
appropriate for Forst to define others' reality. This is a judgment on his 
part, one he is not qualified to make. It also implies that people don't know 
their own reality. How patronizing. How unnecessary. How typical. 
Words spoken in haste reflect more than a moment of bad temper. Words spoken in 
haste, as well as words that are well chosen, influence and reinforce lifelong 
attitudes. We need to see words as a reflection of our values and beliefs and 
be responsible for them. 
And we need to be honest in examining them. Words are powerful and when used to 
express sexist and racist ideas remind women and people of color of a whole 
history of personal and societal exploitation, oppression, powerlessness and 
pain.
