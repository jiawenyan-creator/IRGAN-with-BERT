<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document reestablishes the time-limited tolerances for residues of the herbicide clopyralid (3,6-dichloro-2-pyridinecarboxylic
acid) in or on the raw agricultural commodities (RACs) field corn, grain at 1.0 part per million (ppm); field corn,
fodder at 10.0 ppm; and field corn, forage at 3.0 ppm; and in or on the processed agricultural commodities (PACs) field
corn, milling fractions at 1.5 ppm. DowElanco requested these time-limited tolerances. The time-limited tolerances
expire on December 31, 1996.

EFFECTIVE DATE:

 This regulation becomes effective April 25, 1994.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of March 11, 1994 (59 FR 11573), pursuant to petitions from DowElanco, EPA proposed to establish time-limited tolerances
under sections 408 and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a and 348) for residues of the herbicide
clopyralid (3,6-dichloro-2-pyridinecarboxylic acid) in or on the raw agricultural commodities (RACs) field corn,
fodder at 10.0 ppm; field corn, forage at 3.0 ppm; field corn, grain at 1.0 ppm; and on the processed agricultural commodity
(PAC) field corn, milling fractions at 1.5 ppm. 


There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerances will protect the public
health. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by these regulations may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulations deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
