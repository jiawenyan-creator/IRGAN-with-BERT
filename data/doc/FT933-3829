FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hewetson shares fall on profit warning
Shares in Hewetson fell 5p to close at 40p last night as the Hull-based
provider of goods and services to the construction industry warned that
results for the year to March 1994 would be below current market
expectations but not very different to the Pounds 503,000 achieved last
year.
The two main reasons were very low demand during July at Contract flooring
Sales, the flooring business, and a delay in the recovery of Hewetson
Floors, the raised access flooring business.
However, the directors said that unless conditions worsened there was no
reason to reduce the dividend below the 1.25p paid last year. In addition,
the balance sheet remained strong and the current investment programme would
enhance prospects, they said.
