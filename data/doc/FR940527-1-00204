 

We analyzed the case-mix increases for the recent past and found that case-mix increases have decelerated to about
1.55 percent in FY 1992 and 0.83 percent in FY 1993. It is too early to reliably determine a case-mix increase for FY 1994
from the discharge data. Since case-mix increases appear to be decelerating, we have reduced our projected long-term
increase of 2 percent to 1.5 percent for both FY 1994 and FY 1995. We will continue to monitor case-mix increases and
make appropriate adjustments to our projections. (Since we are using FY 1993 cases for our analysis, the FY 1993 increase
in case mix has no effect on the FY 1995 Federal rate. It does affect the estimated update for the FY 1996 Federal rate
displayed in the projection table in this appendix.) 

Changes in geographic classification and corrections in the hospital wage data used to establish the hospital wage
index affect the geographic adjustment factor. Changes in the DRG classification system and the relative weights
affect the case-mix index. 

Section 13501(a)(3) of Public Law 10366 requires that, for discharges occurring after September 30, 1993,
the unadjusted standard Federal rate be reduced by 7.4 percent. Consequently, the model reduces the unadjusted standard
Federal rate by 7.4 percent effective in FY 1994. Because of the budget neutrality provisions in effect through FY
1995, this provision does not reduce aggregate payments for capital in FY 1994 and FY 1995. 

Section 412.308(c)(4)(ii) requires that the estimated aggregate payments for the fiscal year, based on the Federal
rate after any changes resulting from DRG reclassifications and recalibration and the geographic adjustment factor,
equal the estimated aggregate payments based on the Federal rate that would have been made without such changes. For
FY 1994, the budget neutrality adjustment factor was 1.0033. To determine the factor for FY 1995, we first determined
the portion of the Federal rate that would be paid for each hospital in FY 1995 based on its applicable payment methodology.
We then compared estimated aggregate Federal rate payments based on the FY 1994 DRG relative weights and FY 1994 geographic
adjustment factor to estimated aggregate Federal rate payments based on the FY 1995 relative weights and the FY 1995
geographic adjustment factor. In making the comparison, we held the FY 1995 Federal rate portion constant and set
the other budget neutrality adjustment factor and exceptions reduction factor to 1.00. We determined that to achieve
budget neutrality for the changes in the geographic adjustment factor and DRG classifications and relative weights,
an incremental budget neutrality adjustment of 1.00115 for FY 1995 should be applied to the previous cumulative FY
1994 adjustment of 1.0033 (the product of the FY 1993 incremental adjustment of .9980 and the FY 1994 incremental adjustment
of 1.0053), yielding a cumulative adjustment of 1.00445 through FY 1995. 

The methodology used to determine the recalibration and geographic (DRG/GAF) budget neutrality adjustment factor
is similar to that used in establishing budget neutrality adjustments under the prospective payment system for operating
costs. One difference is that under the operating prospective payment system, the budget neutrality adjustments
for the effect of geographic reclassifications are determined separately from the effects of other changes in the
hospital wage index and the DRG weights. Under the capital prospective payment system, there is a single DRG/GAF budget
neutrality adjustment factor for changes in the geographic adjustment factor (including geographic reclassification)
and the DRG relative weights. In addition, there is no adjustment for the effects that geographic reclassification
has on the other payment parameters, such as the payments for serving low income patients or the large urban add-on.


In addition to computing the DRG/GAF budget neutrality adjustment factor, we used the model to project total aggregate
payments under the prospective payment system and to compute the budget neutrality adjustment factor that would
result in estimated payments under the capital prospective payment system equal to 90 percent of the amount that would
have been payable on a reasonable cost basis. This budget neutrality factor is applied to the Federal and hospital-specific
rates, but not to the hold-harmless payments. 

Additional payments under the exceptions process are accounted for through a reduction in the Federal and hospital-specific
rates. Therefore, we used the model to calculate estimated exceptions payments and the exceptions reduction factor.
This exceptions reduction factor ensures that estimated aggregate payments under the capital prospective payment
system, including exceptions payments, equal estimated aggregate payments under the capital prospective payment
system without an exceptions process. Since changes in the level of the payment rates change the level of payments
under the exceptions process, the budget neutrality and exceptions adjustments factors must be determined through
iteration. Further, these two factors interact with each other so that they must be determined simultaneously. We
successfully determined values for these factors so that the exceptions adjustment factor is correct, and estimated
payments under the capital prospective payment system equal 90 percent of estimated Medicare inpatient capital
costs. 

In the August 30, 1991 final rule (56 FR 43517), we indicated that we would publish each year the estimated payment factors
generated by the model to determine payments for the next 5 years. The table below provides the actual factors for FY
1992, FY 1993, and FY 1994, the proposed factors for FY 1995, and the estimated factors that would be applicable through
FY 1999. We caution that, except with respect to FY 1992, FY 1993, FY 1994, and the proposed FY 1995, these are estimates
only, and are subject to revisions resulting from continued methodological refinements, more recent data, and any
payment policy changes that may occur. In this regard, we note that in making these projections we have assumed that
the cumulative DRG/GAF adjustment factor will remain at 1.00445 for FY 1995 and later because we do not have sufficient
information to estimate the change that will occur in the factor for years after FY 1995. 

The projections are as follows:
