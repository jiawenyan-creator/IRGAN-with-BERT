FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: Fannie Mae tops quarterly
profits record with Dollars 402m
THE FEDERAL National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) yesterday reported
its sixth consecutive quarter of record profits.
The largest residential mortgage provider in the US made a profit of Dollars
402m between April and June, eclipsing the previous record of Dollars 381.6m
in the first three months of the year. The results were 21 per cent higher
than the Dollars 331.5m earned in the second quarter of 1991.
The second quarter was the busiest ever in terms of the number of home loans
bought from mortgage originators and the amount of mortgage-backed
securities (MBS) sold to investors. The combined volume of these was a
record Dollars 67bn, up from Dollars 55.6bn in the previous quarter.
Because of strong loan acquisitions and securitisations, the total MBS
outstanding rose to Dollars 413bn and the net mortgage portfolio to Dollars
140bn by the end of the quarter.
The sharp increase in business activity helped offset a decline in Fannie
Mae's net interest margin, which fell from an average of 145 basis points in
the first quarter to 139 basis points. The company attributed this to
increased refinancings in the mortgage portfolio.
Fannie Mae's acquisition of foreclosed properties rose slightly to 2,391,
while charge-offs in the quarter were Dollars 58.6m, up from Dollars 56.7m
in the first quarter. The serious delinquency rate for single-family home
loans fell to 0.6 per cent in May of this year.
Fannie Mae's earnings were initially well received, but profit-taking saw
them close Dollars  3/4 lower on the day at Dollars 63 3/4 .
