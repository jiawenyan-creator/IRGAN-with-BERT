GANG WATCH; 
HEARTLESS OR HEARTSICK? 
New York is supposed to be the ultimate example of the impersonal, hard-hearted 
big city, the place where pedestrians hustle past the homeless, and screams for 
help are met with shut windows. 
But New York's anguished reaction to a recent spate of shooting deaths of 
children is healthier, and more humane, than the numbed -- and some would even 
say blase -- reaction Southern California has shown to the relentless drive-by 
murders of children here for the past several years. 
Various excuses are put forth for Southern California's muted response. 
1. We are geographically separated. Does that assume a commuter who drives 40 
miles from Costa Mesa to downtown Los Angeles is supposed to care less about a 
child shot a few miles from his job than one killed a few miles from his home? 
2. Southern California lacks the screaming headlines of tabloid newspapers. 
True, but what we lack in tabloids we more than make up for in local television 
news. 
3. New York had a concentration of four murders in a short time to spark the 
city's fury. A roundup of weekend crime stories in Southern California 
typically reports at least three gang-related shootings. Quite a few result in 
the deaths of children. 
Genuine widespread outrage about gang-related violence hit Los Angeles once -- 
when a young professional woman was the victim of a bullet in Westwood. But 
most victims of gang-related violence aren't professionals -- and don't die in 
Westwood. 
And now it looks as if we're running out of excuses.
