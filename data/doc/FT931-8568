FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Thai Stock Exchange seeks
improved disclosure
THE Stock Exchange of Thailand yesterday announced plans to improve
financial disclosure by listed companies after the shutdown of First City
Investment, a small listed finance and securities company.
FCI suspended payment of mature promissory notes this week and the Bank of
Thailand, the central bank, said the company was 'temporarily closed'
because of liquidity problems pending further efforts to arrange a rescue.
FCI is thought to have several billion baht of bad and doubtful debts on its
books. The BoT said an investigation last year showed that FCI had extended
loans to affiliated companies without collateral.
Bangkok Bank, the country's largest commercial bank, has been asked by the
BoT to rescue FCI in exchange for broking licences and other incentives, but
a deal has yet to be completed.
Mr Seri Chintanaseri, SET president, said after an SET board meeting
yesterday that companies suspected of providing misleading financial
information would be reported to the newly-formed Securities and Exchange
Commission.
