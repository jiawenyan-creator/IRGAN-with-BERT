FT  25 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Strategists bearish as bourses
stage recovery
Bourses recovered yesterday, but strategists were not encouraging, writes
Our Markets Staff. Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura raised the spectre of US
mutual fund redemptions and forecast further significant downside distress.
FRANKFURT extended Wednesday afternoon's gentle recovery, the Dax index
rising 22.66 to 2,055.97 on the session, and by an Ibis-indicated 18.74 to
2,058.79 in the post bourse.
Turnover fell from DM7.5bn to DM5.1bn. The talk was of short-covering: above
average gains by the end of the afternoon, for Deutsche Bank, Hoechst in
chemicals and one or two engineers, were registered mainly by the shares
worst hit during the falls of the previous two days.
One of the main contrasts during the session was a DM7.10 gain to DM309.70
for BASF, on nine-month figures far better than expected; Henkel, at the
less cyclical end of the chemicals sector, produced a progress report in
line with expectations, was totally outfaced by the BASF performance, and
fell DM6 to DM576.
Other fallers included Metallgesellschaft, returning from suspension to an
intraday low of DM95, and a post-bourse close DM31 lower at DM111.
Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok, at Robert Fleming in Frankfurt, was still not
attracted to the metals trader. Its planned capital reduction, he said,
meant an effective price for the shares of DM220, on which the company might
be capable of earning DM10 a share at peak.
MILAN struggled to keep pace with political developments, the Comit index
rising 3.01 to 626.65 in a technical rebound after the 3.9 per cent slide
during the previous two sessions. The mood remained tense, and trading was
said to be exceptionally thin.
Among the day's best gainers was RAS, L285 higher at L15,073 amid arbitrage
between the ordinaries and rights.
Fininvest's Standa rose L800 to L35,000, but in very thin volume of just
1,500 shares, and Mondadori was L30 higher at L13,830 after Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the prime minister, said he would sell his Fininvest companies.
AMSTERDAM regained Wednesday's losses, and saw a rise in the AEX index of
4.81 or 1.2 per cent to 406.81.
ING helped the market as the banking and insurance group turned in better
than expected third quarter figures and the shares rose Fl 1.80 or 2.3 per
cent to Fl 80.00.
Philips did even better on the day as some US funds returned as buyers,
lifting the shares Fl 1.70 or 3.4 per cent to Fl 52.30. Analysts noted that
the shares had been oversold following third quarter results earlier this
month which were seen as being at the high end of forecasts.
PARIS greeted the first day of the December account with a rise of 2.2 per
cent, the CAC-40 index
gaining 41.59 to 1,934.68 in turnover estimated at FFr3.6bn.
During the October account the market rose 2.7 per cent, only the third time
that it had risen during 1994.
While activity was generally muted a few issues stood out, most notably
Eurotunnel, which climbed 6.5 per cent to FFr21.95, as some investors took
the view that recent weakness had been overdone.
Alcatel Alsthom, another stock which has suffered heavy falls in recent
weeks, added to Wednesday's gain with a rise of FFr20.60 to FFr440.20.
Danone, which said that it had bought a majority stake in a leading
Argentine biscuit manufacturer, rose FFr8 to FFr774.
ZURICH's mood was improved by stronger bonds and the stabilisation of the
dollar, and the SMI index rose 22.5 to 2,568.6.
UBS bearers fell another SFr7 to SFr1,118, after a low of SFr1,108, in
further reaction to Tuesday's vote for a unitary share. The registered stock
was down SFr4 to SFr248. By contrast, SBC and CS Holding bearers both gained
SFr10, to SFr362 and SFr546 respectively, continuing to benefit from
switching out of UBS.
Von Roll bearers fell SFr235 to SFr190 after being suspended from trading on
Wednesday when the company announced a restructuring programme which
included a 90 per cent capital cut. The steel and engineering group's losses
ballooned last year to SFr441m.
STOCKHOLM recovered 1.6 per cent, helped by a good nine-month package from
the forestry products group, MoDo.
The Affarsvarlden General index closed 23.60 higher at 1,499.00. MoDo
increased its profits forecast for 1994, and said it intended to simplify
its share structure. Its B shares jumped SKr16 to SKr349. Trygg-Hansa, the
insurer, saw its B shares gain SKr5.50 to SKr75.50 on a bullish newspaper
article.
TEL AVIV offered only a token recovery, the Mishtanim index rising 1.29 to
166.24. The blue chip index, by Wednesday, had dropped 31 per cent this
year. At a conference in London yesterday fund managers urged the country to
broaden its shareholder base, noting that just 1 per cent of equity was
currently held by foreigners.
