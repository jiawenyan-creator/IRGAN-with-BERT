FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Sale Tilney in receivership
Sale Tilney, the mini-conglomerate whose shares were suspended at 4 1/2 p on
December 30, has been placed in receivership.
The group, which has interests in food, industrial products, insurance and
financial services, had been in discussions with its syndicate of banks -
led by National Westminster - concerning a financial restructuring.
Mr Maurice Withall, of Grant Thornton which has been appointed receiver to
Sale Tilney and five of its subsidiaries, said that most of the banks had
agreed to the refinancing proposals, but that unanimous agreement had been
impossible.
