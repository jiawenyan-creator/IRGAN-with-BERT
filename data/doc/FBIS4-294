  A military official of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda 
[UNAMIR] spoke of an "explosion" heard at the airport but not 
gunfire. An investigation is under way, he added. Rwandan 
Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana told AFP that she was 
informed of the disaster by UNAMIR but that she did not have 
details on the circumstances. According to UNAMIR, "the 
explosion" was heard shortly after 2100 local time (1900 GMT). 
More than three hours later, there was total confusion in 
Kigali where the inhabitants remained in their homes for fear of 
violent incidents, a radio Rwanda reporter said. As of tonight, 
the radio was yet to report on any disaster. [passage omitted]
