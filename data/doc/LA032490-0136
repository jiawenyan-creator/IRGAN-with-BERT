ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 
ARMBANDS PROTEST HARRIS EXECUTION 
In Orange County courtrooms and at the offices of the public defender, black 
armbands are becoming a familiar sight. 
And if attorneys Denise Gragg and Roger Alexander have their way, many more 
armbands will be visible before the planned April execution of Robert Alton 
Harris. 
In an effort to attract attention to the first person to be put to death in the 
California gas chamber since 1967, Gragg and Alexander, who are both deputy 
public defenders, began passing out armbands last week. Harris, who is 
scheduled to die April 3, was sentenced to death for the 1978 murders of two 
San Diego teen-agers. "We just felt so helpless about the whole death penalty 
issue," Gragg said. "We are hoping that the armbands will at least start people 
thinking and talking about what the death penalty really means." 
Deputy Chief Public Defender Carl Holmes says most of the 120 attorneys in the 
office are wearing the armbands because they deal directly with clients put on 
death row. 
Several attorneys from the public defender's office say they will attend the 
all-night vigil for Harris at San Quentin April 2. "We are stressing that 
murder is wrong no matter who commits it, and that the public should understand 
the reality of that," Alexander said. ALLISON SAMUELS
