  [Text] The Department of Foreign Affairs [DFA] has issued a 
passport to former Ambassador Roberto Benedicto. Acting Foreign 
Secretary Tomas Padilla clarified, however, that the issuance of 
a passport to Benedicto does not mean he is being recognized as 
a Philippine citizen. There are reports that Benedicto is a 
Venezuelan citizen. Padilla said that once it is proven that 
Benedicto is no longer a Filipino his passport will be cancelled. 
  The DFA's decision to issue a passport to Benedicto complies 
with the Sandiganbayan's [Anti-Graft Court] order. The court 
threatened to arrest and detain Foreign Affairs Secretary 
Roberto Romulo if Benedicto was not given a passport.
