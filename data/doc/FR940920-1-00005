 

Paperwork Reduction Act Statement


This proposed rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval number 31500011.


Regulatory Analysis


The Commission has determined that a regulatory analysis is not required for this proposed rule. The Commission believes
the intent of the regulatory analysis has been met through the extensive consideration given to the development of
the Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors and the improved
STS, both of which involved an opportunity for public comment. The criteria being added to 50.36 are identical
to those contained in the final policy statement and have been used by the NRC and the nuclear power industry to define
the content of technical specifications since September 1992. The criteria will continue to be used even if this proposed
rule is not adopted. The proposed rule does not impose any requirements but, rather, allows nuclear power reactor
licensees to voluntarily use the criteria to relocate existing technical specifications that do not meet any of the
criteria to licensee-controlled documents. The NRC staff also uses these criteria to determine whether technical
specifications are appropriate to provide continued regulatory control over new requirements or positions that
have been justified consistent with the backfit rule.
The Commission considered the need for and consequences of this proposed action when it made the decision to not only
publish the criteria in the final policy statement but also to codify the criteria through rulemaking. Appropriate
alternative approaches to this action have been identified and analyzed over the life of the Technical Specifications
Improvement Program, beginning with an earlier attempt to define the content of technical specifications through
rulemaking. As described in the background discussion, the Commission published a proposed amendment to 50.36
(47 FR 13369) on March 30, 1982. However, because of difficulties with defining criteria for technical specifications
and because of other higher priority licensing work, the rule change was deferred. In February 1987, the Commission
published an interim policy statement on Technical Specification Improvements and in July 1993, published the final
policy statement. During review of the final policy statement, the Commission concluded that the four criteria should
be codified in a rule. Thus, alternative approaches to regulatory objectives have been identified and analyzed,
and the Commission has decided that there is no clearly preferable alternative to codifying the four criteria in a
rule. With regard to evaluation of values and impacts of alternatives, the Commission believes there is no difference
in the values or impacts of implementing the criteria through use of the final policy statement or through a rule, except
that the criteria are more readily available to future users in a rule than in a policy statement.


Regulatory Flexibility Certification


In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 [5 U.S.C. 605(b)], the Commission certifies that, if promulgated,
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed rule
affects only the licensing and operation of nuclear power plants. The companies that own these plants do not fall within
the scope of the definition of ``small entities'' as given in the Regulatory Flexibility Act or the Small Business
Size Standards in regulations issued by the Small Business Administration at 13 CFR part 121.


Backfit Analysis


The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 50.109, does not apply to this proposed rule and, therefore, a
backfit analysis is not required because these amendments do not involve any provisions that would impose backfits
as defined in 50.109(a)(1).
