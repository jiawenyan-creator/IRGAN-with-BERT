BRIEFLY 
Amoco to Look for Oil in Poland: Amoco Corp. and the state-owned Polish Oil and 
Gas Co. will conduct a 12-month joint geological study of roughly 40% of 
Poland, the Chicago Tribune reported. If the exploration indicates potential 
oil reserves, Amoco and Polish Oil and Gas will negotiate a second contract 
that would enable the Chicago-based company to drill exploratory wells and 
produce oil.
