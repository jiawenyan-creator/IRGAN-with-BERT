  [Text] Different fragments of plasmid pBR322 DNA were used 
as the left and right arms probes of YAC (Yeast Artificial 
Chromosome). The rare cutting restriction enzyme and pulsed 
field electrophoresis were used for long range physical mapping 
of YACs. A YAC containing 2bA3 DNA locus with the length of 800 
kb was analysed with four different restriction enzyme to obtain 
the long range physical map. 
  Key words: YAC, pulsed field electrophoresis, 2bA3, long 
range physical map.
