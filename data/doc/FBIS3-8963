  [Text] Warsaw, March 11--Leader of Russia's 
ultra-nationalistic Liberal-Democratic Party Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy arrived in Warsaw on Friday evening. Zhirinovskiy 
was welcomed by leader of the National Self-Defence (Samoobrona) 
Front Janusz Bryczkowski at the Warsaw international airport. 
  In the airport lounge Zhirinovskiy was awaited by a 
20-strong 
group of young people from the Independent Student Association 
(NZS) and the League of Republican and Academic Corporation 
Polonia. They were holding a banner with a slogan "We Do Not 
Want Fascists in Poland." A group of uniformed young people 
from the National Self-Defence Front tried to interfere. 
  When after customs clearance Zhirinovskiy was being led to a 
car, he was followed by a crowd of people, predominantly 
journalists. A brigade for the airport protection, equipped 
with batons, shields and helmets, intervened, hitting several 
journalists with batons. 
  Zhirinovskiy, invited to Poland by Janusz Bryczkowski, will 
participate in a Saturday meeting of the first congress of the 
National Self-Defence Front. 
  According to an opinion poll carried out on February 4-6 by 
the Public Opinion Polling Centre (OBOP), 53 per cent of the 
polled have heard of Zhirinovskiy and have shown interest in 
him, 34 per cent have heard about him but have not been 
interested and 13 per cent have not heard of the Russian 
politician. 
  According to 66 per cent of those who heard of Zhirinovskiy, 
representatives of the Polish cabinet and politicians should not 
establish any contact with the Russian politician.
