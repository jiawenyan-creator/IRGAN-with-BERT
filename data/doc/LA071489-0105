EARNINGS 
Hilton Hotels Corp.: The Beverly Hills-based hotel operator reported 
second-quarter profit of $42 million, up 3% over a year ago. Revenue totaled 
$265 million, up 6%. The results reflected a 14% gain in income due to improved 
results at facilities in New York, Chicago and Hawaii, which more than offset 
start-up losses from two full-service hotels and one all-suite hotel. Gaming 
income also edged up 2% to $36.8 million.
