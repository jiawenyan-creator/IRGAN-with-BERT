FT  18 AUG 93 / Romania rail strike begins to buckle
A CRIPPLING strike by Romanian train drivers appeared to be winding down
late yesterday after Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu, prime minister, warned of instant
dismissal unless workers returned to work.
Mr Vacaroiu's ultimatum came at the end of an emergency meeting of the
minority left-wing government which he called to take 'exceptional measures'
against the week-old pay strike, taking place in defiance of an 80-day
supreme court ban on work stoppages.
Radio Bucharest later reported that by the government's evening deadline
most of the 18,000 striking railway workers were back at work in the capital
Bucharest and most other big cities.
There were some holdouts in Iasi, Brasov and Timisoara.
