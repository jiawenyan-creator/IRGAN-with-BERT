MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . . 
More than $240,000 was raised for AIDS research, education and patient care 
Sunday at an Art Against AIDS/Los Angeles auction held at Butterfield &amp; 
Butterfield. The auction brings the total raised by the two-year Art Against 
AIDS campaign -- which has included events in Los Angeles, New York and San 
Francisco -- to nearly $5 million. "We were absolutely delighted," Sally 
Morrison, director of development for the American Foundation for AIDS 
Research, said Monday. She noted that proceeds from the auction will be split 
equally between AmFAR and AIDS Project Los Angeles. The top price at the 
auction, which included works by Richard Diebenkorn, Laddie John Dill, Larry 
Bell and Carlos Almaraz, was generated by a David Hockney lithograph, "Walking 
Past Two Chairs," which went for $65,000. ALEENE MacMINN
