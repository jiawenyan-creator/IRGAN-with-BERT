FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Farringford seeks capital injection
Farringford, the hotel company in which Sir Frederick Pontin holds a 36.6
per cent stake, announced that it was in talks with a number of parties with
a view to arranging an injection of additional capital.
In October the company announced a pre-tax loss for the 14 months ended
February 29, 1992 of Pounds 1.02m, against a Pounds 66,000 deficit for the
1990 calendar year.
The accounts were yesterday approved by the directors, although the auditors
report as currently drafted contains a going concern qualification.
