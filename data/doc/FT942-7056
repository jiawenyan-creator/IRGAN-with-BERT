FT  27 MAY 94 / Openness pledged on Bank meetings
A Labour government would continue the practice of publishing the minutes of
the monthly monetary policy discussions between the chancellor and the Bank
of England, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said yesterday.
Mr Brown said he had no plans to stop publication of the minutes in spite of
the political difficulties that could follow the disclosure of differences
with the Bank.
His pledge, given at an election press conference, could be an important
step in Labour's battle to convince the financial markets of the credibility
of its economic policies and its commitment to low inflation.
The danger of an open clash with the Bank over inflation prospects might,
however, inhibit the pace at which Labour could implement an expansionary
policy aimed at creating full employment.
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank, told the Commons Treasury committee
this week that publication would contribute to financial market stability by
showing that blatant political manipulation of interest rates was not
possible.
Mr Brown said the publication of minutes showed that tensions between Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and the Bank were increasing because Mr
Clarke was unable to convince Mr George of the credibility of his policy.
'With lower productivity, a bigger trade deficit, a smaller manufacturing
sector, the slowest rate of growth of exports of any European Union member .
. . Britain now desperately needs a growth strategy that gives sustainable
long-term growth,' he said.
Aides said Mr Brown believed that Labour's plans for greater spending on
education and training would reduce inflationary pressures by removing
capacity bottlenecks from the economy.
They said this would substantially reduce the danger of politically damaging
clashes with the Bank over the pace of economic growth.
