  [Text] The Meretz party has decided to stick by its 
opposition to Refa'el Eytan's Tzomet party joining the coalition 
with Labor. Their position, outlined by Environment Minister 
Yosi Sarid, followed a meeting with Prime Minister Rabin at 
which he again asked Meretz to lift its veto on Tzomet. It was 
reported after this session that while Meretz did not rule out 
the possibility, they did not think this was the right time. 
Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili said he got the impression 
that while Meretz would accommodate the Orthodox SHAS [Torah 
Observing Sephardim] party on issues of constitutional 
legislation, it would not budge where Tzomet was concerned. 
  Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan today refused to promise not to 
join the present government. He was speaking to settler leaders 
from Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip who visited him at his 
home in Tel 'Adashim, and expressed alarm at the reports of 
contacts between Tzomet and the ruling Labor party. However, 
Eytan called Qol Yisra'el this morning saying it was not true he 
had accepted the government's basic guidelines or its policy on 
the peace negotiations. 
  Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu says his party will 
support 
the government, but only from the opposition benches, if it 
stops freeing terrorists and takes steps to restore security. 
Netanyahu made the statement at a right-wing demonstration, one 
of a series taking place every Friday at Ra'ananna in central 
Israel.
