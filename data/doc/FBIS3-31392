  [Text] Budapest, 16 Feb (MTI) -- Hungarian Parliament's 
Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday [16 February] held a 
closed session and discussed the use of Hungarian airspace by 
NATO's AWACS aircraft. 
  Members of the committee, which included Foreign Affairs 
State Secretary Andras Kelemen, made it clear that the issue at 
hand is not that the Hungarian Government had decided to exclude 
the AWACS from Hungarian airspace, but rather that it calls the 
attention of Brussels to the original mandate of the air 
missions, in accordance with the Constitution. If NATO wants 
the mandate to be expanded, that would require approval by the 
Hungarian Parliament. 
  Earlier, Hungarian Parliament gave its consent to the use of 
the country's airspace by NATO's AWACS aircraft, to fulfill 
their mission of monitoring the no-fly zone in Bosnia. 
  A new situation has now come about. In the wake of the 
ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, the AWACS aircraft may also 
serve military missions. In view of this, Hungarian Prime 
Minister Peter Boross recently told a group of foreign 
journalists that the AWACS mission would have to leave Hungarian 
airspace during NATO air strikes against Serbian positions at 
Sarajevo. 
  There is consensus among the Hungarian parliamentary parties 
that Hungary should refrain from participating in military 
actions.
