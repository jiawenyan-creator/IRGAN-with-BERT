  [Text] Johannesburg March 23 SAPA -- Twenty-five per cent 
of black people believe there will be no free choice in the 
April election, according to the results of a survey by the 
Institute for Multiparty Democracy released on Wednesday [23 
March]. Political analyst Prof Lawrence Schlemmer said a quarter 
of blacks in Johannesburg might alter their votes because of 
constraints or perceived constraints. 
  Only 54 per cent of blacks were confident their votes would 
not be known by the community. The survey, conducted in 
February, asked respondents about factors constraining freedom 
of choice. 
  In kwaZulu/Natal 44 per cent believed that there was fear 
among those who did not support the area's dominant party. 
Forty-nine per cent of blacks said they lived in areas where 
only one party was dominant. 
  "These results...provide strong evidence that community 
pressures and the fear of violence and intimidation will mean 
that many voters may cast a ballot which is less than fully free 
and fair."
