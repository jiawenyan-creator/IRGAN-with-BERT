  [Text] The Camilist Union of the Army of National 
Liberation, UC-ELN claimed responsibility for the attack on the 
life of Rudolf Hommes Rodriguez, finance and public credit 
minister, minutes after the explosion was heard. In a telephone 
call, the group added that although they failed this time, they 
will try again. A visibly shaken Minister Hommes spoke to 
reporters after he met with President Cesar Gaviria. 
  Two hours after the attack, the finance and credit 
minister's 
face said it all. As he left the ministry, reporters saw an 
ashen, shaken Hommes never seen before. 
  [Begin recording] [Hommes] I left my house and half a block 
away the bomb exploded. 
  [Reporter] What did you feel at that time? 
  [Hommes] A big bang and lots of smoke. 
  [Reporter] The ELN has just claimed responsibility for the 
attack. It said it opposes the policy of poverty and 
unemployment in the country. 
  [Hommes] I have nothing to say. Pardon me, but this is a 
security risk. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Montenegro [not further identified] said you 
have been receiving threats for a year. 
  [Homes] Pardon me, you understand. There will be a news 
conference later. This is not the place to be giving an 
interview. [end recording]
