METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT FRENCH TO RETIRE IN 
JUNE 
The superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District, who saw the 
school system through its first-ever strike last fall, announced Friday that he 
will retire at the end of this school year. 
Robert L. French, 59, will step down June 30, school board president Frank 
Fenton said. Fenton said the resignation was accepted "with deep regret" and 
noted that French "has been with us during a very difficult period for this 
district." 
French called his three years as superintendent "rewarding and challenging." He 
said he will remain available as a consultant and plans to become a university 
instructor. Sol Levine, assistant superintendent for curriculum, will become 
acting superintendent.
