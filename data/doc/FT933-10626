FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Chrysalis closes MAM Leisure after losses
CHRYSALIS, the music and media group, is to wind down MAM Leisure, its
amusement machines subsidiary, and withdraw from the business.
Chrysalis expects MAM Leisure, which employs 400 people, to report a loss of
Pounds 6m in the year to end-August, following a deficit of Pounds 1.8m last
year.
Mr Chris Wright, chairman, said the business could not return to
profitability without further rationalisation and considerable investment.
The business had been badly hit by recession, but had also been adversely
affected by the fall in the number of people in the 18 to 25 age group.
The group said it expected to have withdrawn from the business by the end of
1993.
It said it was not yet clear whether all 400 employees would lose their jobs
as there was still a possibility that small parts of the business might be
sold to local operators.
Chrysalis had considered several options before deciding to close the
business.
After failing to find a buyer for the subsidiary, the group considered
withdrawing from several British regions and concentrating on the
most-densely populated parts of England. It decided, however, that this
would not solve its problems.
