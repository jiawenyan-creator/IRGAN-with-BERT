FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Eleco halved to Pounds 1.58m
PRE-TAX PROFITS were halved at Eleco Holdings, the building contracts and
contracting group, in the year to June 30.
The decline, from Pounds 3.35m to Pounds 1.58m, came on sales down from
Pounds 56.8m to Pounds 45.2m.
The final dividend is reduced to 1p (2.3p), making 3.3p (4.6p) for the year,
on earnings per share of 3.2p (7.3p).
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 5.94m mainly represented further losses on
the closure of the property development division.
