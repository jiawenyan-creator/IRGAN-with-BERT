FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: WestLB turns in 25.5% increase
WESTDEUTSCHE Landesbank Girozentrale (WestLB), the German regional public
sector bank, yesterday unveiled group operating profits of DM584m (Dollars
399m) for the first half of the current year. This is an increase of 25.5
per cent on half the total profits for the previous year.
The figure included a first time contribution from Wfa, a housing-finance
specialist in the state of North Rhine Westphalia, integrated into the group
at the beginning of the year.
Stripping out the contribution from this acquisition, group profits climbed
by 11.1 per cent on the comparable figure for the previous year.
The bank attributed the profits rise to a marked increase in income from
trading as well as straightforward lending business.
Earnings on interest income rose by 17.5 per cent to DM1.21bn while
commission income climbed by 14.4 per cent to DM172m. Partial operating
profits, which do not include trading results, advanced 24.1 per cent to
DM470m.
Costs rose by 16.4 per cent within the group, reflecting the increased
headcount following two acquisitions last year. Assets at the end of June
stood at DM252bn, 9.8 per cent up on the DM229.7bn figure at the end of last
year.
Hessische Landesbank Girozentrale (Helaba), the large German financial
institution based in the state of Hesse, reported half-year operating
profits down by 3.4 per cent to DM143.3m. Excluding trading profits, profits
dropped by DM8.8m to DM107.6m.
The reduced profits reflect the bank's activities in eastern Germany, where
from July 1 this year Helaba took over the role of regional central bank and
central bank for the savings banks in the state of Thuringia.
