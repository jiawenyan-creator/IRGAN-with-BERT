ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
ANAHEIM; 
ARSON IS PROBABLE CAUSE OF APARTMENT FIRE 
Arson was the probable cause of a fire that forced seven families to flee their 
apartments early Sunday morning, authorities said Monday. 
The blaze, which started about 1:18 a.m., caused an estimated $40,000 damage to 
six carports and cars at the apartment complex in the 1100 block of North East 
Street. 
Authorities were continuing their investigation and had no suspects, Anaheim 
city spokeswoman Barbara Burke said. 
The apartment complex was also the site of a Dec. 7 fire that was caused by a 
short circuit in a stereo system, fire officials said. No one was injured in 
either blaze. 
The Sunday fire caused power outages in many apartments at the complex, so 
officials of the county chapter of the American Red Cross relocated all 33 
residents there to motels in Anaheim. Red Cross officials said residents 
probably would be able to return to their apartments today.
