FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Stena Line income up 76% to
SKr476m
Stena Line, the world's biggest ferry operator, yesterday announced a 76 per
cent increase in profits to SKr476m (Dollars 64m) for the first eight
months.
It said it expected profits of around SKr500m for the full year, well ahead
of last year's SKr273m.
The group said market conditions in Scandinavia remained weak and there was
fierce price competition on its UK routes.
But these factors were more than offset by higher volumes, cost-cutting,
profits from a ship sale and lower financial costs. The group also said that
its 1993 figures had been hit by SKr55m in restructuring costs.
Turnover rose by 7 per cent to SKr6.67bn due mainly to increased volumes.
Passenger numbers rose 6 per cent to 10.9m from 10.3m, while freight traffic
climbed 8 per cent to 584,000 units.
Lines around the UK saw a 10 per cent increase in passenger volumes, but the
benefit was eroded by price-cutting in the run-up to the full opening of the
Channel Tunnel.
Scandinavian routes were affected by lower consumer spending and the weak
Swedish krona, which has affected travel between Sweden and Denmark/Germany.
