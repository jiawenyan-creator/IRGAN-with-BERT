  [Text] London, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Britain today rejected 
a proposal by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to hold an 
international summit to resolve the two-year-old Bosnian civil 
war, saying it was not a good idea at present. 
  Speaking after British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd 
briefly 
met Vitaliy Churkin, Russian peace envoy to former Yugoslavia, 
British officials said that the Americans also shared this view. 
  "A summit can be useful at the right time. That moment has 
not yet come," one official said. 
  Hurd will hold separate talks with U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
before they meet British Prime Minister John Major later today 
to discuss how to put together efforts on a peace settlement for 
Bosnia. 
  Meanwhile, Britain announced it would take 50 wounded 
Moslems 
evacuated from Gorazde for medical treatment in Britain. 
  Hurd told parliament Britain had agreed to a plea for help 
from the U.N. High commission for Refugees. 
  The U.N. plans to evacuate 600 Moslems wounded in a 
three-week Serb assault on the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, a 
U.N.-designated "safe area" in eastern Bosnia. 
  Hurd said he believed the Bosnian Serbs were complying with 
the terms of a NATO ultimatum under which the Serbs had to 
withdraw all their heavy weapons 20 km from Gorazde by 0001 GMT 
on Wednesday. 
  Hurd reiterated that despite the threat of NATO air strikes 
to protect Muslim safe areas, the conflict could only be brought 
to an end by a negotiated settlement.
