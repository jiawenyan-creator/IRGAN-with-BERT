BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK. 
Also on Wednesday, the Orange County Sheriff's Advisory Council and Hutton 
Development Co. will give local business and community leaders a presentation 
on DNA identification, an increasingly popular new field of forensic research. 
The Sheriff's Department hopes to raise about $200,000 to establish a DNA 
identification laboratory in the county. 
The technique allows detectives to identify criminals from minute pieces of 
physical evidence gathered at the crime scene, including skin, hair or body 
fluids. By comparing these samples with the DNA makeup of samples taken from 
crime suspects, authorities can make a positive identification accepted by the 
court.
