FT  16 AUG 93 / Mix-up delays mail peace move
A BALLOT which might resolve the 14-day-old Royal Mail dispute in Cardiff
has been delayed after confusion in the Union of Communication Workers.
Hopes of a settlement had been high after the UCW's national executive
agreed on Thursday to recommend a return to work on the basis of a framework
agreement negotiated between national officials and Royal Mail. The dispute
is over new fixed shift patterns.
Mr Derek Hodgson, deputy general secretary of the UCW, said yesterday that
the intention had been for national officers and local branch
representatives to hold a meeting in Cardiff on Saturday to explain to the
900 workers the progress made in the talks and to decide whether to proceed
with a ballot. He said many people did not attend, however, because of
confusion about whether the meeting was going ahead. A meeting is now
planned for today.
