FT  24 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Foods strong
In a market that lacked strong features, the spotlight fell on Northern
Foods, which turned out to be the best performer in the FT-SE 100 in
percentage terms, following a broker's recommendation.
Agency broker Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken visited the company last Friday and
issued a strong buy recommendation, predicting 10 per cent earnings and
dividend growth in each of the next two years.
Investors sent the shares climbing 5 to 277p, an improvement of around 1.7
per cent on the day. Volume was, however, no more than average at 1.9m by
the close.
