FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Birse shares fall 36% on warning
Shares in Birse Group, the construction and property concern, fell by 36 per
cent from 67p to 43p yesterday as the company warned that its results for
the year to April 30 were likely to include an exceptional Pounds 8.5m
deficit.
The loss stems from the appointment of receivers to their client,
Quietwaters, and will result in a loss on ordinary activities for the year.
The directors, therefore, will not be recommending the payment of a final
dividend.
