FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Teva 36% ahead on back of US
sales surge
TEVA, Israel's leading pharmaceutical manufacturer, reported net profits up
36 per cent to Shk87.7m (Dollars 31.7m) in 1992, due mainly to a surge in US
sales which carried overseas turnover ahead of domestic for the first time.
Sales in the US, where Teva has been targeting growth for several years,
rose by more than 30 per cent to account for some 35 per cent of total group
sales of Shk1.09bn, which in turn were up by 23 per cent. Total overseas
sales reached Shk560m, reflecting Teva's strategy of growing beyond the
limited local market and establishing itself as one of Israel's leading
technology-based exporters.
The company said Teva's concentration on generic and prescription drugs
through its own manufacturing and through Lemmon, its US subsidiary, had
enabled it to sustain strong overseas growth despite the generally weak
economic background throughout much of the year.
Teva, which is listed on Nasdaq in the US, has put much of its effort abroad
into the more homogenous US market. But it said it was now seeking to expand
in Europe, which at present accounts for 10 per cent of sales. It has
acquired companies in Italy and Germany, and says it is looking for further
acquisitions to extend its penetration in Europe.
The inflation-adjusted results showed earnings per ordinary share at
Shk3.34, up from Shk2.74 in 1991.
Green Cross, a Japanese pharmaceutical and blood-products concern, posted a
59 per cent fall in consolidated net profits to Y1.24bn (Dollars 10.5m) from
Y2.97bn for the year to December, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo.
Sales rose 4.9 per cent to Y106.6bn from Y101.58bn, while pre-tax profits
fell 15 per cent to Y5.3bn from Y6.2bn. Earnings per share fell 58 per cent
to Y5.99 from Y14.35.
