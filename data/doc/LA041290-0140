BRIEFLY 
PUC OKs Expanded Toll-Free Calls: Approval by the state Public Utilities 
Commission will allow Pacific Bell to expand current 800-prefix service and add 
a "custom-800" service, aimed at small businesses, that uses ordinary business 
telephone lines rather than leased lines and allows customers to design their 
own statewide or regional toll-free calling areas. Customers also can choose 
from a number of participating long-distance companies to carry calls between 
local calling areas.
