METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN'T ELIMINATE 6TH GRADES 
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel ruled Friday that the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula Unified School District cannot eliminate the sixth grade at 
two elementary schools and allow fifth-graders to transfer to the school of 
their choice next fall. 
The district wanted to close sixth-grade classes at Mira Catalina and Rancho 
Vista elementary schools, allowing the students to attend either Ridgecrest or 
Malaga Cove intermediate schools or Miraleste High School, where a sixth grade 
would have been created. The judge said the plan conflicts with her 1988 ruling 
barring the district from making changes until an environmental impact report 
is completed.
