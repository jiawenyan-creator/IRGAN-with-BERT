PLACING A LAND DISPUTE IN CONTEXT 
Regarding "Bigger Wilmington of Old" (Times, April 27): 
Had I known the tenor of the responses from (the) Harbor City Chamber of 
Commerce and (Los Angeles) Councilwoman (Joan Milke) Flores' office, I could 
have provided additional information to properly place the issue in context. 
The impression left by the article is that the area in question has long been 
considered part of Harbor City. 
This is not the case at all. It has only been in the last several years that 
any dispute has existed. 
If any "land grab" has occurred, it has been on the part of those in Harbor 
City who know darn well that this area has always been considered to be part of 
Wilmington. The Harbor Freeway has never been commonly accepted as a border by 
the people of Wilmington, and Mrs. Flores' statements merely reflect her 
estrangement from this community and the political favoritism which she 
lavishes on the expanded Harbor City, which is her creation. 
Certainly her predecessor John Gibson never believed that this area was part of 
Harbor City. A copy of the 1977-1979 Wilmington directory provided by Mr. 
Gibson to the community contains a map of Wilmington which clearly shows the 
area under discussion. I submit that 1979 was not turn of the century or 
ancient history; it was just 11 years ago. . . . 
The city enjoys the option of defining districts for purposes of 
administration. However, it has absolutely no authority or right to 
misrepresent, distort or rewrite history. The Wilmington Historical Society is 
dedicated to the preservation of Wilmington's past and we will not allow these 
misrepresentations to go unchallenged.
