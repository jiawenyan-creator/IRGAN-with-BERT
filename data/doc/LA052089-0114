BRIEFLY 
Stock Exchange Charges Rival: The Philadelphia Stock Exchange filed a lawsuit 
accusing the American Stock Exchange of pirating its blueprint for a 
controversial new financial instrument that combines aspects of stocks and 
futures. The Philadelphia exchange demanded that the New York-based Amex stop 
trading the new financial product, known as stock baskets or index 
participations, under rules allegedly copied from Philadelphia. The Amex said 
there was no basis to the charge. Philadelphia and the Amex started trading the 
stock baskets a week ago after a stay was lifted by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. The product is based on various stock indexes and pays quarterly 
dividends, although its holders do not own the underlying stock.
