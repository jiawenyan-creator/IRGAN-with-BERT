FT  25 APR 94 / Company news (This week): Big brothers to approach Dollars
1bn mark - Ford/General Motors
The revival of America's love affair with the car helped Chrysler, smallest
of Detroit's three big motor manufacturers, to report its most profitable
quarter ever last week. This week similar leaps forward are expected from
Chrysler's two bigger brothers, General Motors and Ford.
The main factor driving the Big Three's profits is the release of pent-up
demand for cars, triggered by economic growth. US car sales in the first
three months of this year were 15 per cent higher than a year earlier, and
because manufacturers have worked hard to cut costs and increase efficiency,
the effect of the increased revenues is magnified at the bottom line.
Conversely, the picture is less encouraging in Europe, where many markets
are depressed and sales are weak.
But back in the US, two other factors are operating in the manufacturers'
favour: higher realised prices, thanks to a reduction in the number of
rebates and other sales incentives, and a shift in the sales mix away from
less profitable fleet sales towards more profitable retail sales.
On Wednesday Ford is expected to announce a surge in first-quarter net
profits from Dollars 572m to possibly Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m). General
Motors is forecast to deliver a similar leap in first-quarter profits on
Thursday, from Dollars 513m to Dollars 1.1bn or more.
