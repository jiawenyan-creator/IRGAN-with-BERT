WALL COVERING CAN CREATE SPECIAL DECORATING EFFECTS; 
HOME IMPROVEMENT 
An illusory library. Marble looks. Decorators always have been able to achieve 
special effects -- at decorators' prices. 
Now these effects can be achieved through wall coverings, in Mary Gilliatt's 
Faux Finish Background and Borders, a collection cooperatively produced by the 
British interior designer and writer and Sandpiper Studios. 
"The '90s will be a period of rich decoration, ornamentation, opulence and fine 
detail. Faux finishes and trompe l'oeil are lovely techniques that have moved 
out of the magazines into people's homes," Gilliatt said. 
One of the trompe l'oeil ("fool the eye") wallpapers looks like a classical 
library with leather-bound books. The faux finishes also emulate marble and 
other textures. 
"Although many people have become adept at creating painted faux finishes on 
their walls -- such as marbleizing, rag rolling or sponging -- for most, 
achieving professional results is beyond their time or abilities," says Richard 
Felber, who heads Sandpiper. The new wallpapers make it possible to achieve the 
same effect with ease and affordability, he says. 
Other trends noted by Felber are pattern mixes and inspirational themes, both 
covered in his company's collections. Victorian-style stripes intertwined with 
flowers, paisleys and damasks feature in the Camden Passage collection. 
"The more-is-more look is here to stay, be it with Victoriana, English Country 
or Old European looks." 
Sandpiper's Bless This House collection includes papers that have borders with 
Biblical quotations and other messages of love and friendship, incorporated in 
traditional designs.
