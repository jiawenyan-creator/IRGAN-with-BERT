FT  14 OCT 94 / Economic Watch: Norway's trade surplus climbs
Norway's September trade surplus, excluding ships and oil platforms, jumped
to NKr4.71bn (Pounds 448m) from NKr1.96bn in last year's comparative period,
bolstered by a 29 per cent rise in exports, the Central Bureau of Statistics
said yesterday. A sharp increase in the value of oil and gas exports and
fish were mainly behind the advance. September export volumes of oil and gas
were NKr6bn, against NKr8bn last month. This was mainly due to lower crude
oil prices and reduced output, which was caused by extended work programmes
during annual maintenance of offshore platforms. Karen Fossli, Oslo
Sweden's consumer price index rose 0.9 per cent in September from August.
The monthly figures brought the year-on-year inflation rate to 2.7 per cent,
unchanged from August but down from 4.2 per cent in September 1993.
France's gross domestic product grew at an inflation-adjusted rate of 1 per
cent in the second quarter of this year. The increase is in line with market
expectations and is identical to the provisional estimate.
Spanish registered unemployment rose to 16.54 per cent in September from
16.34 per cent in August. It was marginally down on the 16.60 per cent in
September 1993.
