WRONG TIME 
Concerning the Aug. 19 interview with rock musician Bob Geldof: Samuel Pepys 
lived during the Restoration period in England, not the Reformation (as Geldof 
was quoted as saying). 
The two periods were about 130 years apart: 1529 marked the beginning of the 
Reformation; 1660, the Restoration.
