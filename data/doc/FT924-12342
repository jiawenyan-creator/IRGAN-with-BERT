FT  21 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: CFCs on the move
The industrial difficulties that could follow international bans on the use
of ozone-depleting chemicals were highlighted in two UK government reports
last week.
The UK is among 70 countries which have signed the 1987 Montreal Protocol,
committing themselves to phasing out the production of CFCs, one of the
substances threatening the ozone layer, by 2000. It is also bound by tighter
EC regulations to phase out CFCs by 1997.
According to a Department of Trade and Industry report by Touche Ross, the
management consultants, UK consumption of CFCs as solvents in electronics
and dry cleaning fell by 75 per cent between 1986-91. But the report said
the main reason was 'a reduction in industrial activity during the
recession'.
While it found that high-technology and precision cleaning companies had
already made plans to find substitutes, small high street dry cleaners could
not afford the new equipment. The report expects 'a sharp distinction
between general and specialist dry cleaners' to emerge as the ban takes
effect.
A second study of the use of CFCs in refrigeration and air conditioning,
carried out for the Department of the Environment by the March Consulting
Group, concluded that consumption in these industries fell by only 15 per
cent between 1986-91, partly because less than 2 per cent of CFCs in
refrigeration are recovered and reused.
Depending on the choice of phase-out dates, it predicted that refrigeration
demand for CFCs will outstrip supply between 1994-2000 unless leakage and
recycling rates improve.
Assessment of likely difficulties is not helped by the lack of up-to-date
figures. A 1990 DTI survey showed that the UK's total consumption of
ozone-depleting substances halved between 1986-89 to 31,000 tonnes due to
the phasing out of CFCs in aerosols. However, more recent figures are not
available.
