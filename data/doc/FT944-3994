FT  10 DEC 94 / Invalidity switch set to save Pounds 2bn
The government announced yesterday that it expects to claw back nearly
Pounds 2bn in social security spending in the next three years by replacing
invalidity benefit with an incapacity benefit from April next year, James
Blitz and David Owen write.
Amid growing controversy about social security reforms Mr William Hague,
minister for the disabled, said yesterday that savings from the benefit
would grow dramatically in its first years.
The savings will largely come from tougher medical tests and a reduction in
the number of people eligible for support.
Mr Hague said in a parliamentary written answer that the tests would save
Pounds 210m in 1995-96. This would rise to Pounds 700m in 1996-97 and Pounds
1bn in 1997-98.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, attacked the change,
saying it would force 90,000 'into the dole queues' in its first year and
190,000 in its second.
Five companies will compete for the contract to automate 20,000 post offices
and the benefits payment system, the Department of Social Security announced
yesterday.
They are British Telecommunications, IBM, ICL, Cardlink UK, and the
Electronic Data Systems division of General Motors. The department says the
introduction of a smart card system will help eliminate fraud.
