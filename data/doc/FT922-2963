FT  13 JUN 92 / US-Russia arms cut talks make progress
THE US and Russia last night reported progress towards further deep cuts in
their long-range nuclear arsenals, but left it unclear whether an agreement
would be possible at next week's summit meeting in Washington.
Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Soviet
foreign minister, who met in London yesterday, both said there was 'a good
chance' of an accord.
But Mr Baker added: 'We are not there yet, and there are still problems that
have to be decided.'
The two ministers reported back last night to President George Bush and
President Boris Yeltsin, who are due to start their summit on Tuesday.
Mr Baker said there had been movement by both sides towards an agreement
that would lead to deep reductions, including some in the most destabilising
weapons. By this he meant land-based intercontinental missiles with multiple
warheads, which the US sees as being the most likely to be used early in a
conflict and has proposed eliminating altogether.
Russia, however, has argued that would unfairly favour the US. These
missiles make up the bulk of Russia's long-range nuclear weapons but only a
quarter of the US arsenal.
On the other hand, proposals made by Mr Bush in January included a reduction
of only one third in the number of warheads on US submarine-launched
ballistic missiles, weapons, in which the US has an overwhelming advantage.
The Russians have indicated, however, that they will accept the US target of
reducing to about 4,700 strategic warheads each, about half the current
level. The cuts would go much further than the Start treaty signed by the
two leaders last July, but not as far as the original Soviet proposal of
about 2,500 warheads.
Mr Baker said a summit agreement on 'broad parameters' would be better than
no agreement at all. Neither would give any details on the state of the
talks. 'The rest will depend on our presidents,' Mr Kozyrev said.
