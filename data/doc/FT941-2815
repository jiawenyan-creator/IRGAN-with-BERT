FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Japanese groups in multi-media
venture
Four Japanese companies have formed a multi-media venture that could prove a
strong force in advanced communications in Japan.
Tokyo Power Electric, Mitsubishi and Mitsui, the trading companies, and
Tokyu, a railway company, are to work together on a project to use cable TV
networks for telephone services.
The project will test the possibility of linking an optical fibre cable
network with a cable TV network to offer multi-media services. The TV link
is operated by Tokyu Cable, part of the Tokyu group.
The project will initially look at technical and marketing problems, but
will eventually study bringing together broadcasting, telephonic and
interactive video services.
Tokyo Electric Power, Mitsubishi and Mitsui also have stakes in a cable
network. The alliance is widely seen as creating a foundation for a
telecommunications network which could compete effectively with the industry
leader, NTT.
The move comes amid de-regulation of Japan's telecommunications and cable TV
industries. The ministry of posts and telecommunications recently said it
would allow cable TV companies to offer telephone services on their lines.
