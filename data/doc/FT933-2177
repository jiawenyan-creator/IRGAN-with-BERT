FT  20 SEP 93 / (CORRECTED) World Bank to raise lending commitments
Correction (published 21st September 1993) appended to this article.
THE World Bank plans to increase lending commitments by up to Dollars 3.2bn
in its current fiscal year from Dollars 26.9bn in the past year to June 30,
reflecting the cost of its battle against poverty and the growing financing
needs of former communist states.
The bank's annual report, published yesterday, disclosed that both arms of
the bank - the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
and its soft loan affiliate, the International Development Association (IDA)
 -have been authorised to increase lending this year.
The IBRD, which made commitments of Dollars 16.95bn in the past financial
year, has been empowered to boost its lending commitments to between Dollars
17bn and Dollars 19.5bn in fiscal 1994. The IDA, which lends funds to the
poorest developing nations at very low, subsidised interest rates, is
expected to commit about Dollars 7.4bn in 1993-94 against Dollars 6.75bn in
1992-93. Countries qualifying for IDA credits have incomes per head of
Dollars 765 or less.
The report contained figures showing how World Bank lending provides
business for companies in the industrialised world. The UK, which has
provided Dollars 6.08bn for the IBRD and IDA since their inception, has won
contracts worth Dollars 11.2bn in support of World Bank projects,
representing a return of Dollars 1.85 in orders for every Dollars 1 invested
in the bank.
In the case of the US, the return has been Dollars 1.09 for each Dollars 1
ploughed into the World Bank. This compares with Dollars 1.01 in the case of
Japan; Dollars 1.51 for Germany and Dollars 1.82 for France.
Total World Bank lending to Europe and central Asia increased to Dollars
3.84bn in 1992-93 from Dollars 2.14bn the previous year, as 11 former Soviet
republics and two of the Baltic republics joined the bank. Russia became the
third largest user of IBRD funds, with four borrowings totalling Dollars
1.37bn.
The two heaviest borrowers from the IBRD in 1992-93 were China (Dollars
2.16bn) and Argentina (Dollars 1.96bn); Mexico and India took fourth and
fifth places. India was the biggest drawer on IDA, borrowing Dollars 1.53bn,
followed by China (Dollars 1.02bn), Pakistan (Dollars 429m), Ethiopia
(Dollars 371m) and Ghana (Dollars 354m).
In regional terms, Africa was the biggest user of IDA finance, taking
Dollars 2.77bn in 1992-93. But overall World Bank lending to Africa fell
sharply to Dollars 2.8bn from Dollars 3.9bn reflecting the absence of any
IBRD lending to Nigeria or the Ivory Coast.
Actual IBRD and IDA lending to the poorest countries (with annual per capita
incomes of less than Dollars 635) fell last year to Dollars 9.96bn from
Dollars 10.86bn. However, the bank is placing greater emphasis on poverty
reduction in its programmes.

CORRECTION
In the article 'World Bank to raise lending commitments', in the Financial
Times of September 20, a reference was made in the first paragraph to the
bank's lending commitments of 'Dollars 26.9bn in the past year to June 30'.
This figure should have been Dollars 23.7bn.
