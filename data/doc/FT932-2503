FT  18 JUN 93 / Arts: Today's Television
Sports fans? They consist largely of the retired, the unemployed and
insomniacs . . . or so the BBC seems to think. Having acquired the rights to
Ascot, the Australian Tests, the US Open Golf and the Eastbourne Tennis
Tournament what do they do? They show Cricket And Racing on BBC1 in the
morning starting at 10.55 - very handy for the unemployed; Cricket, Racing
And Tennis on BBC2 in the afternoon starting at 2.20 - jolly nice for the
retired; and Royal Ascot followed by Cricket: Second Test on BBC1 starting
five minutes before midnight: very suitable for insomniacs. Golfers are
luckier, they get half an hour of Golf: US Open on BBC2 at 10.00 pm and then
another 65 minutes for night owls beginning at 12.10. And having banished
sport from the hours when most people are free to watch television what does
the BBC offer instead? Right, lots of repeats. Between 7.30 and 9.30 they
repeat The Rock'n'Roll Years, Casualty, and Alas Smith And Jones. Remember
all the fuss about the end of Cheers? (hardly difficult since it was last
week). Here we go again with repeats, starting at 9.30 on C4.
