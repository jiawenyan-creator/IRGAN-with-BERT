  [Text] Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Angel C. 
Alcala said the coastal environment has become a critical and 
often dominant ecological presupposition of economics, social, 
and cultural life as he launched the 9th coastal environment 
program (CEP) impact site in Telbang, Alaminos, Pangasinan. 
  CEP has a P90 million [Philippine pesos] funding for 1994, 
and P5 million has been allocated to the Region 1 CEP. 
  The launching was copped by a giant clam seeding activity 
led 
by Alcala and Alaminos local officials, and assisted by the 
University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute. 
  The program was earlier launched in eight impact sites in 
Palaui Island, Sta. [Santa or Holy] Ana, Cagayan; Palauig, 
Masinloc, Zambales; Ulugan Bay, Palawan; Prieto Diaz, Sorsogon; 
Taclong Island, Guimaras, Ilo-ilo; Mahanay Island, Bohol; Guian, 
Samar; and, Murcielagos Bay, Misamis Occidental. 
  Alcala said this program curse the disproportionate focus of 
DENR [Department of Environment and Natural Resources] programs 
on the upland ecosystems. [as published] 
  The program embraces the coastal communities and fisheries 
pertaining to their productivity, biodiversity, integrity, 
sustainability, and equitability of access and use. 
  It mobilizes stakeholders and local communities in the 
protection, conservation, and management of their coastal areas 
on sustainable basis.
