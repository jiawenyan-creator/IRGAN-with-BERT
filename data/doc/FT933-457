FT  29 SEP 93 / Coal consortium appoints chief
A CONSORTIUM formed to bid for all British Coal's assets in Scotland
yesterday signalled its determination to push ahead by appointing a senior
Scottish businessman as its chief executive.
Mr Brian MacDonald, formerly managing director of the Turner Group, a
privately-owned engineering services company, is to manage and arrange
finance for the bid by Mining (Scotland).
Mining (Scotland)'s co-chairman Professor Ross Harper, a Glasgow solicitor
and prominent Conservative, said the consortium hoped to be in possession of
British Coal's Scottish assets by the end of next year.
Earlier this month the government announced that it would be offering
British Coal for sale as five regional businesses, one of which would be
Scotland. A privatisation bill is expected in the Queen's Speech in
November.
British Coal has only one working deep mine in Scotland, Longannet, which
supplies ScottishPower. It also has the Frances pit in Fife which is
retained on a care and maintenance basis, as well as substantial opencast
mines.
Mr MacDonald, 54, said his job would end with the appointment of a chief
executive to operate the company on the success of the bid.
So far no other companies have declared an interest in buying British Coal's
Scottish assets.
