FT  24 JUN 92 / Japan will lend more to India this year
JAPAN has promised to extend loans worth Y111.91bn (Pounds 476.21m) to India
in the year ending next March, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Tokyo. This represented a 5 per cent rise
from the Y106.59b in loans to India a year earlier, he said.
The loans to be extended in 1992-93 will be used for various public works
projects, the ministry official said.
Mr PV Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister, arrived in Japan on Monday for
a five-day official visit. He and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, his Japanese
counterpart, met yesterday for discussions on various international issues.
The two men also agreed to hold talks on promoting the non-proliferation of
nuclear weapons, although details have yet to be decided, the official said.
India, which exploded a nuclear device in 1974, has repeatedly stressed that
its nuclear programme is peaceful. However, it has refused to sign the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) which it believes discriminates in
favour of existing nuclear powers. It has said it will not change its
position at least until 1995 when the treaty is reviewed.
India has also said it also objects to a US-backed proposal for a five-power
conference to create a zone free of nuclear weapons in south Asia, based on
the belief that nuclear disarmament is a global problem.
Mr Rao repeated India's objection to signing the NPT; his Japanese host
suggested New Delhi give the matter further consideration.
