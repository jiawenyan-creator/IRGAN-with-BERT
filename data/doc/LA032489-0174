LIFESAVERS HOPES BUYERS WANT A TASTE OF NOSTALGIA 
Planters LifeSavers Co. hopes customers hungry for nostalgia will savor the 
return of its old-fashioned flavors not seen on store shelves in decades. 
The company's Holland plant recently began producing the "Limited Edition 
Nostalgia Flavors" -- "Lic-O-Rice," "Choc-O-Late" and "Pepsin." Stores began 
carrying them a week ago. 
All three of the limited edition flavors were developed in the 1920s. 
Lic-O-Rice and Pepsin were discontinued in 1938, and Choc-O-Late was produced 
until 1968. 
"Our society's general interest in nostalgia is booming these days, and many 
Americans associate LifeSavers candy with warm memories of their childhood and 
quieter, simpler life styles," said Jeff Walters, associate product manager for 
the Winston-Salem, N.C.-based company. 
Company officials said the three flavors will be sold for a limited time in a 
response to consumers' requests. 
When LifeSavers candies first rolled into stores in 1912, Pep-O-Mint was the 
only flavor available. 
Over the years, 45 flavors have been sold at various times, and 34 billion 
rolls have been purchased. Currently, 17 flavors are on the market.
