<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Peace Speeches"] </F>
  [Text] The high-sounding speeches that we heard yesterday 
during the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement in Cairo 
consisted of empty rhetoric to camouflage the reality that what 
was agreed on neither responds to the Palestinian people's 
legitimate aspirations nor contributes to the achievement of 
security, safety, justice, and peace, either in the long-term or 
short-term. 
  General talk about peace, security, and prosperity is of no 
benefit when the agreement's provisions are filled with mines 
and with everything that is liable to reduce the chances of a 
just settlement. Moreover, resorting to glittering slogans that 
talk about the Arab character of Jerusalem and rejection of 
settlements mean nothing when the speaker himself is prepared to 
peddle an agreement that neither guarantees Jerusalem's Arab 
character nor puts an end to settlement activity. 
  In this context we have to recall al-Sadat's ringing speech 
from the Knesset's podium several years ago and how this speech 
established nothing but the Camp David approach and how it 
failed to contribute at all to the expansion of a peace coveted 
by all the region's peoples. 
  Will we be far from the truth if we say that the "peace" 
speeches that we heard yesterday are copies of al-Sadat's speech 
without any additions or subtractions?
