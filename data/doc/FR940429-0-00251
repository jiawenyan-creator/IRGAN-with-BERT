acceptable to the Secretary and ensures that the 
institution is able to pay all required refunds; and 

(ii) Contributes to that tuition recovery fund. 

(2) The Secretary considers an institution to be 
financially responsible, even if the institution is not otherwise 
financially responsible under paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) and 
(b)(6) through (9) of this section, if the institution_

(i) Submits to the Secretary an irrevocable letter of

(including refunds of institutional charges and repayments to the 
Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs 
administered by the Secretary). The Secretary considers the

audited financial statement indicates that_

(

1

) All taxes owed by the institution are current; 

(

2

) The institution's net income, or a change in total net 
assets, before extraordinary items and discontinued operations, 
has not decreased by more than 10 percent from the prior fiscal 
year, unless the institution demonstrates that the decreased net 
income shown on the current financial statement is a result of 
downsizing pursuant to a management-approved business plan; 

(

3

) Loans and other advances to related parties have not 
increased from the prior fiscal year unless such increases were 
secured and collateralized, and do not exceed 10 percent of the 
prior fiscal year's working capital of the institution; 

(

4

) The equity of a for-profit institution, or the total 
net assets of a non-profit institution, have not decreased by 
more than 10 percent of the prior year's total equity; 

(

5

) Compensation for owners or other related parties 
(including bonuses, fringe benefits, employee stock option 
allowances, 401k contributions, deferred compensation allowances) 
has not increased from the prior year at a rate higher than for 
all other employees; 

(

6

) The institution has not materially leveraged its assets 
or income by becoming a guarantor on any new loan or obligation 
on behalf of any related party; 

(

7

) All obligations owed to the institution by related 
parties are current, and that the institution has demanded and is 
receiving payment of all funds owed from related parties that are 
payable upon demand. For purposes of this section, a person does

associate or baccalaureate degree that demonstrates to the 
satisfaction of the Secretary that_

(i) There is no reasonable doubt as to its continued 
solvency and ability to deliver quality educational services; 

(ii) It is current in its payment of all current 
liabilities, including student refunds, repayments to the 
Secretary, payroll, and payment of trade creditors and 
withholding taxes; and 

(iii) It has substantial equity in institution-occupied 
facilities, the acquisition of which was the direct cause of its 
failure to meet the acid test ratio requirement. 

(4) The Secretary may determine an institution to be 
financially responsible even if the institution is not otherwise 
financially responsible under paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
if_

(i) The institution notifies the Secretary, in accordance 
with 34 CFR 600.30, that the person referenced in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section exercises substantial control over the 
institution; and 

(ii)(A) The person repaid to the Secretary a portion of the 
applicable liability, and the portion repaid equals or exceeds 
the greater of_

by that person or any member or members of that person's family, 
either alone or in combination with one another;

similar agreement; or 

(

3

) Twenty-five percent, if the person or any member of the 
person's family is or was a member of the board of directors, 
chief executive officer, or other executive officer of the 
institution or servicer that owes the liability, or of an entity 
holding at least a 25 percent ownership interest in the 
institution that owes the liability;
