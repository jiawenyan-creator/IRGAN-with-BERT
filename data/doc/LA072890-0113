BRIEFLY 
Snag in PTL Buyout Bid: A Jewish-born evangelist's $52-million bid to buy Jim 
Bakker's PTL ministry and its opulent Christian retreat was in danger of 
collapse as creditors dragged their heels on finalizing the sale. "We are very 
hopeful that the trustee and the creditors can quickly come to a resolution," 
said would-be buyer Morris Cerullo, whose World Evangelism ministry is based in 
San Diego. 
"However, we made it clear that we cannot stay in this deal much longer," he 
added. Cerullo, 58, was in Atlanta en route to Fort Mill, S.C., to take 
possession of PTL, when he learned that even though the ministry's secured 
creditors had approved the sale, they were dickering over language in the sale 
contract.
