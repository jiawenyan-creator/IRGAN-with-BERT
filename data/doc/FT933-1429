FT  24 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Bid for Vietnam oil
MOBIL, the US oil company, yesterday said it was interested in exploration
and downstream business in Vietnam, and would bid for the hotly contested
contract to work the Blue Dragon off-shore field, Reuter reports from Hanoi.
A dozen large companies are expected to submit bids by the October 11
deadline for the structure, which some regard as Vietnam's most promising
unworked off-shore field.
Mr Robert J. Aberbach, Singapore-based vice-president of Mobil Eastern
Exploration and Development, said there was no basis for speculation that
the deal was being reserved for Mobil as a lever on Washington to lift its
economic embargo against Hanoi.
Other companies expected to bid for the business include Amoco and Phillips
Petroleum of the US, Shell (UK-Dutch) and British Petroleum.
