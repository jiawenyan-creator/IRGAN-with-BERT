FT  30 JUN 92 / Iliescu standing for presidency
ROMANIA'S president, Mr Ion Iliescu, has confirmed he will run for a second
term of office in elections due on September 27, writes Virginia Marsh in
Bucharest.
The president, who has been campaigning unofficially for more than three
months, has accepted the nomination of the Democratic National Salvation
Front (DNSF), a left-wing party which counts many former communist officials
among its members. The DNSF was formed in April after Mr Iliescu's
supporters left the National Salvation Front.
