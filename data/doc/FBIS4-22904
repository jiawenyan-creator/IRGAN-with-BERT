  [Text] Boxing systems, so-called micrological safety or 
protective boxes, are usually used to protect personnel in 
microbiological and virological laboratories working with and 
conducting research on infectious materials. Foreign and 
domestic experience accumulated to this day allows us to 
differentiate boxing systems into different classes depending on 
their structure, which is determined in turn by the danger of 
the infectious material to man and by the nature of the research 
operations and processes. 
  These principles determine division of bioprotection boxes 
into structures which keep the infectious material within the 
volume of the corresponding systems partially (class 1 and 2 
boxes) or completely (class 3 boxes). 
  A modern approach to designing and correctly using boxing 
systems would be impossible without developing scientifically 
substantiated criteria of their protective effectiveness which 
would ensure the required protection for personnel. In turn, the 
necessary protection for personnel must be based on strictly 
grounded infection risk criteria derived from the degree of 
danger of the infectious materials under investigation and of 
the corresponding laboratory operations to which they are 
subjected. 
  Various criteria are used today to describe the protective 
effectiveness of boxing systems depending on their type. For 
class 1 and 2 boxing systems the protection factor is such a 
criterion, while for class 3 boxing systems it is the degree to 
which pressure falls over a certain time in an airtightness 
test. In addition, as was noted above, the risk of infection to 
working personnel in the course of their research, which is a 
probability characteristic, is the regulated parameter 
determining the specific choice of boxing system. The importance 
of developing scientific methodological approaches in this area 
and substantiating, on their basis, optimum requirements on the 
structure of boxing systems depending on the degree of danger of 
research with infectious material carried out within them is 
completely obvious, and it is the main goal of this paper. 
  Let us examine a typical situation associated with operating 
a boxing system in correspondence with the objective posed 
above. Let us assume that a researcher must perform certain 
manipulations with infectious materials during his work using a 
boxing system. We know that an aerosol containing infectious 
material is formed as a result of various research operations, 
and that this aerosol may enter the laboratory's air 
environment with circulating air. In order to reduce the 
concentration of infectious material in aerosol form in the 
boxing system and prevent its escape into the room, both the 
boxing system and the laboratory are ventilated. The natural 
processes by which the concentration of infectious material 
decreases--owing to sedimentation and inactivation in response 
to various factors--should be kept in mind in this case. 
Possible infection of laboratory personnel is a stochastic--that 
is, probablistic--process. If we assume that particles of 
infectious material in the air environment of a laboratory 
follow a Poisson distribution, then the probability of uptake of 
a certain quantity (k) of particles by working personnel will be 
determined by the expression: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;

  where P--probability; C[.sub][/]--concentration of 
infectious material in the room, number of cells per 1 
m[.sup]3[/] (cells.m[.sup]-3[/]); Q--pulmonary ventilation 
volume, m[.sup]3[/].sec[.sup]-1[/]; II--infecting dose, 
cells; _t_--time, sec. 
  An expression for the probability of uptake of at least one 
particle of infectious material by working personnel may be 
obtained from equation (1): 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Naturally equation (2) will be valid for the case when no 
devices are used in the course of the research to protect the 
personnel (that is, the work is done without a boxing system). 
When a boxing system is used in research as a primary barrier, 
the probability of infection of working personnel will be 
significantly lower. Equation (2) would have to be modified for 
this case. This is associated primarily with the fact that a 
boxing system is a technical device, failure of which reduces 
its protective effectiveness during the failure interval. A term 
accounting for the probability of infection of personnel in the 
event of the boxing system's failure must be introduced into 
equation (2) in this connection. We can arrive at a general 
equation for the probability of infection of working personnel 
in this way: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  where _l_--intensity of infection of personnel when the 
boxing system works without failure, sec[.sup]-1[/], 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  _l_[.sub]O[/]--intensity of infection of personnel in the 
event of the boxing system's failure, sec[.sup]-1[/], 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  _l_--intensity of the boxing sytsem's failure, sec; 
C[.sub][/]--concentration of the infectious material in 
the room prior to the boxing system's failure, 
cells.m[.sup]-3[/]; C[.sub]o[/]--concentration of 
infectious material in the room created as a result of the 
boxing system's failure, cells.m[.sup]-3[/]; t--time of 
boxing system's failure, sec; _t_--current time of work of the 
boxing system, sec. 
  Equation (3) is inconvenient for analysis in the form shown 
here, which is why it is suitable to simplify it. Because 
variables _l__t_, _l_[.sub]_s_[/]_t_ _l_[.sub]O[/]_t_ 
are 
less than unity, expanding the exponents into a series and 
limiting ourselves to just linear terms, we can arrive at a 
transformed expression for the probability of infection of 
personnel working with infectious material in a boxing system: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  In the case where the permissible probability (risk) of 
infection of working personnel is known, equation (4) may be 
used to calculate infection intensity. The authors of [2] 
proposed a value of permissible infection risk equal to 
1.10[.sup]-5[/] per person (over the course of a year) on the 
basis of an analysis of the frequency of cases of infection in 
different laboratories and the risk of death of people 
(accidents) owing to various random natural and social factors. 
Basing ourselves on this value of infection risk, we can 
calculate the permissible intensity of infection 
(_l_[.sub]II[/]), which is 1.10[.sup]-8[/] 
hr[.sup]-1[/] (on the condition that on the average, 
personnel are in contact with infectious material on the order 
of 1,000 hours per year). The resulting infection risk value 
agrees with published data [7]. Thus, performing the 
corresponding substitutions and transformations, we can arrive 
at the following equation for the intensity of infection of 
working personnel: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Let us analyze this equation. In the case of trouble-free 
operation of the boxing system, the intensity of its failure 
_l_[.sub]_s_[/] is equal to zero, from which it follows that 
_l_=_l_[.sub]II[/]=1.10[.sup]-8[/]hr[.sup]-t[/]--that 
is, that the intensity of infection of working personnel when 
the boxing system operates trouble-free is equal to the 
permissible infection intensity. However, the intensity of 
failure of the boxing system is always greater than zero, and 
therefore the protective effectiveness of the boxing system must 
provide for a personnel infection intensity of less than 
1.10[.sup]-8[/] hr[.sup]-1[/]. In the theory of the 
reliability of technical systems, redundancy is introduced into 
these systems with the purpose of reducing the failure 
intensity. However, if we assume that the time of operation of a 
back-up fan is from 10-50 sec, a back-up ventilation system 
would not result in a significant decrease in _l_[.sub]_s_[/] 
During this time, a certain quantity of infectious material may 
be released into the laboratory room depending on the 
concentration of the infectious material in the boxing system 
and its infecting dose, which will cause infection of personnel. 
  The risk of infection of personnel may be reduced by 
decreasing the intensity of infection of personnel in the event 
of failure of the boxing system (_l_[.sub]O[/])--that is, by 
correctly (justifiably) selecting the type of boxing system. The 
value of _l_[.sub]O[/] depends on the concentration and form 
(infecting dose) of the infectious material, and therefore the 
optimum type of boxing system should be selected for particular 
operations with certain pathogenic microorganisms. Many years of 
experience of microbiological research are generalized in WHO 
recommendations to permit selection of the type of boxing system 
on the basis of information on the operations being conducted 
and the form of the investigated microorganism [3]. However, the 
boxing system characteristics presented in these recommendations 
are descriptive (for example, airtight boxing systems, boxing 
systems with laminar flow, etc.), and they do not contain 
quantitative characteristics necessary for substantiated design 
and operation of different classes of boxing systems. Equation 
(5) obtained above may be used to substantiate the principal 
technical requirements on particular types of boxing systems. 
  Let us assume as before that a researcher is performing 
various manipulations with infectious material in a boxing 
system, as a result of which infectious material spreads in 
aerosol form, including out into the laboratory room. The 
processes occurring here may be diagrammed, and they may be 
described by the following system of differential equations: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  where k[.sub]p[/]--atomization factor, sec[.sup]-1[/]; 
C--concentration of the investigated sample, 
cells.m[.sup]-3[/]; k'[.sub]o_s_[/], 
k[.sub]o_s_[/]--air exchange factor for the boxing system's 
ventilation system and the room, sec[.sup]-1[/]; 
k[.sub]c[/]--sedimentation coefficient, sec[.sup]-1[/]; 
k&Ngr;&EEgr;--inactivation coefficient, sec[.sup]-1[/]; 
K[.sub]&Bgr;[/]--constant characterizing release of infectious 
material out of the box into the room, sec[.sup]-1[/]; 
k[.sub]B;--constant characterizing transfer of infectious 
material from the room to the box, sec[.sup]-1[/][/]; 
C[.sub]_s_[/], C[.sub][/]--current concentrations of 
infectious material in the boxing system and in the room, 
cells.m[.sup]-3[/]. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Spread of Infectious Material Out of a Boxing System: 
  C[.sub]Q[/], C[.sub]_s_[/], 
C[.sub][/]--initial concentration of infectious material, 
and the concentration formed in the boxing system and room; 
k[.sub]p[/]--process of formation of aerosol out of the 
infectious material at a rate k[.sub]p[/]; 
k[.sub]c[/]--process of sedimentation of infectious material 
at a rate k[.sub]c[/]; k[.sub]&Ngr;&EEgr;[/]--process of 
inactivation of infectious material at a rate 
k[.sub]&Ngr;&EEgr;[/]; k'[.sub]o_s_[/], 
k[.sub]o_s_[/]--process of removal of infectious material by 
means of the ventilation system of the boxing system and the 
room at a rate k'[.sub]o_s_[/]k[.sub]o_s_[/]; 
k'[.sub]B'[/] k[.sub]B[/]--process of movement of 
infectious material out of the room and out of the boxing system. 
  This equation system may be solved in general form by 
numerical methods; however, we are practically interested in the 
stationary case, in which all processes are in equilibrium and 
dC[.sub]_s_[/]/d_r_=dC[.sub][/]/d_t_=0. Equating 
equation (6) to zero and performing a number of manipulations, 
we can obtain an expression for the steady-state concentrations 
of infectious material in the boxing system and in the room: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  We know that the protective effectiveness of class 1 and 2 
boxing systems is characterized by the protection factor 
k[.sub]3[/], which is determined experimentally as the ratio 
of the concentration of aerosol simulating infectious material 
in the boxing system to its concentration in the room [5]. The 
protection factor is not used with a class 3 boxing system 
because the sensitivity of methods for recording simulated 
aerosols is below the real protective effectiveness of a class 3 
boxing system. However, the obtained equation (7a) allows us to 
calculate the protection factor for any class of boxing system: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  It should be noted that two parameters are used in the 
calculations in equation (8) (k[.sub]&Bgr;[/] and 
k'[.sub]&Bgr;[/], which cannot be determined directly by 
experimental means. Both of these parameters may be calculated 
on the basis of the laws of aerodynamics. However, the formulas 
for the above parameters will differ in application to different 
classes of boxing systems due to the structural features of each 
class of boxing system. 
  Thus, class 1 and 2 boxing systems are exhaust systems with 
open access from the front panel. As a rule the protective 
effectiveness of such boxing systems is the product of the 
laminar nature of air flow in the opening in the boxing system 
provided for the operator, and restriction of the operator's 
access into the boxing system by reduction of the area of the 
opening. In this case transport of aerosol from the boxing 
system into the room is associated with turbulization of the air 
flow in the boundary layers of the opening, and with 
manipulations carried out with the operator's hands. A class 3 
boxing system is an airtight one in which access into its 
interior is achieved with hermetically attached gloves. In this 
case transport of infectious aerosol into the room would be 
possible due to its diffusion through existing leaks. 
  It should be noted that different types of boxing systems, 
including similar class 1, 2 and 3 boxing systems intended for 
microbiological research, are widely used today in research on 
toxic and radioactive substances. Theory permitting us to 
calculate protective effectiveness when working with these 
substances has been developed sufficiently well on the basis of 
the laws of aerodynamics for such boxing systems. Because 
calculation of parameters k[.sub]&Bgr;[/] and k'[.sub]&Bgr;[/] 
(coefficients characterizing transport of aerosol from the 
boxing system into the room and its return back into the boxing 
system) does not require knowledge of numerical characteristics 
inherent to microbiological aerosols, the formulas used to 
calculate them will also be valid for boxing systems intended 
for work with infectious material. The following formulas are 
presented in [4] for calculating coefficients k[.sub]&Bgr;[/] 
and k'[.sub]&Bgr;[/]: 
  for class 1 and 2 boxing systems: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  for class 3 boxing systems: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  where f--cross section of the opening (or leaks) in the 
boxing system, m[.sup]2[/]; v[.sub]m[/]--rate of air flow 
in the opening (or leaks), m.sec[.sup]-1[/]; a--thickness of 
the wall of the boxing system, m; A--coefficient of turbulent 
exchange, m[.sup]2[/].sec[.sup]-1[/]; D--diffusion 
coefficient, m[.sup]2[/].sec[.sup]-1[/]; 
V[.sub]_s_[/]--volume of the boxing system, m[.sup]3[/]; 
_D_p--drop in pressure in the boxing system in an airtightness 
test, kg.m[.sup]-2[/]; p[.sub]&EEgr;[/]--absolute pressure in 
the room, kg.m[.sup]-2[/]; t[.sub]p[/]--duration of 
airtightness test on boxing system, sec. 
  The entire complex of equations (5) and (8) may be used with 
regard for formulas (9-9c) to calculate the necessary protective 
effectiveness of different classes of boxing systems using a 
principal indicator such as the protection factor. 
  Let us first examine class 1 and 2 boxing systems. Work not 
leading to formation of a large quantity of aerosol may be 
carried out in boxing systems of this type in accordance with 
WHO recommendations. In addition work with infectious material 
of low pathogenicity is also recommended in such protective 
systems. The following boundary conditions may be adopted for 
this case: an average concentration in the boxing system of 
C[.sub]_s_[/]10 cells.m[.sup]-3[/] (typical of the 
following operations: preparing streak cultures in Petri dishes, 
placing a wire loop bearing inoculation material in a flame, 
pouring culture into test tubes, and so on [5], an infecting 
dose of II|G1.10[.sup]4[/] cells (typical of microorganisms 
evoking typhoid fever, cholera, anthrax and so on [5], a boxing 
system volume (V[.sub]_s_[/]) of 1 m[.sup]3[/] and room 
volume (V[.sub][/]) of 200 m[.sup]3[/] (a 6x8 m 
laboratory). In the event of failure of the boxing system's 
ventilation, it may be assumed that infectious material in 
aerosol form in the boxing system will spread uniformly 
throughout the entire room. Then the concentration of infectious 
material in aerosol form in the room may be calculated using the 
formula: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  and for the conditions presented above it will be 
5.10[.sup]-2[/] cells.m[.sup]-3[/]. Substituting the 
obtained value of C[.sub]II[/] in equations (5) and (8), we 
can determine the required protection factor of class 1 and 2 
boxing systems. It will be found to be equal to 
1.2.10[.sup]5[/]. What this value means physically is that 
when an aerosol concentration of, for example, on the order of 
1.10[.sup]5[/] cells.m[.sup]-3[/] is created in class 1 
and 2 boxing systems, the concentration of aerosol in the room 
will not exceed 1 cell.m[.sup]-3[/]. Next, using equation 
(9a), we can determine the rate of air flow that must be 
maintained in the opening of the boxing system in order to 
ensure the boxing system's required protection factor of 
1.2.10[.sup]5[/]. It will be equal to 0.7 
m.sec[.sup]-1[/]. The air flow rate obtained here by 
calculation confirms the numerous recommendations for this value 
contained in the literature [2,5]. Analysis of information in 
Soviet and foreign literature [6,8] shows that as a rule, class 
1 and 2 boxing systems that have presently been developed in 
different countries satisfy the requirements presented above, 
and consequently provide protection to personnel. 
  Let us examine class 3 boxing systems. Boxing systems of 
this 
type are intended for any laboratory operations with any 
pathogenic microorganisms. In this case we can assume the 
following boundary conditions: average concentration in the box 
(C[.sub]_s_[/]) on the order of 1.10[.sup]3[/] 
cells.m[.sup]-3[/] (the indicated concentration may arise in 
the following operations: centrifugation, vibration of a wire 
loop in the course of inoculation, and intranasal administration 
of infectious material to mice [5]) and an infecting dose (II) 
of one cell (typical for example of Marburg and Lassa viruses as 
well as of bacterial infections such as plague, tularemia and so 
on [5]). Substituting the adopted values into equations (5), (8) 
and (9a), we can come to the conclusion that a properly working 
class 3 boxing system provided guaranteed protection to 
personnel. In the event of failure of the ventilation system of 
a class 3 boxing system (the probability of failure 
_l_[.sub]_s_&gt; reset&gt;  is equal to 1.10[.sup]-4[/][/] 
hr[.sup]-1[/] [1]), an excess pressure in relation to the 
room may be created within it for a short time. The 
concentration of infectious material in the room created as a 
result of failure will depend wholly on the airtightness of the 
system, and it may be calculated by the equation: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  It was noted above that the intensity of infection of 
personnel in the case of trouble-free operation of a class 3 
boxing system is practically equal to zero. In this case an 
expression may be obtained from equations (5) and (10) by which 
to calculate the required airtightness of a class 3 boxing 
system: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Substituting the concentration of infectious material that 
could be created in a class 3 boxing system into formula (11), 
we can obtain the required leakage factor for the boxing system 
(for example, at an average concentration of 1.10[.sup]3[/] 
cells.m[.sup]-3[/] the leakage factor is 
1.44.10[.sup]-3[/] hr[.sup]-1[/]). Boxing systems intended 
for work with radioactive materials are often used today for 
work with infectious materials. According to the All-Union State 
Standard* they are ``airtight'' if the pressure drop 
accompanying an excess air pressure of not less than 1,000 Pa 
(100 kg.m[.sup]-2)[/] does not exceed 10 percent over a time 
interval of not less than 30 minutes. Substituting the indicated 
data into equation (9a), we can determine the leakage factor for 
both boxes, which is 1.9.10[.sup]-3[/] hr[.sup]-1[/]. We 
can also use equation (11) to calculate the permissible average 
concentration of infectious material in this type of boxing 
system, which will be 0.7.10[.sup]3[/] 
cells.m[.sup]-3[/]--that is, for practical purposes the 
necessary protection is afforded to personnel by a boxing system 
of this type. 
  Thus a scientific methodological approach is presented here 
making it possible to substantiate the principal technical 
requirements on boxing systems in relation to different 
conditions of their use. The main thing is that design and 
operation of boxing systems must be directly interrelated with 
the actual conditions of their work, inasmuch as characteristics 
such as the system's reliability, the possible concentrations of 
infectious material in the aerosol formed when performing 
various research operations, the degree of danger of the 
material in question, and the permissible risk to personnel 
carrying out particular types of research must be accounted for.
