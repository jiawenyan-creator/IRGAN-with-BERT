FT  15 JAN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Western training goes east
Four programmers from the Moscow Oil Refinery found language barriers
falling when they attended a course at Independent Computer Solutions, a
London consultancy.
ICOS sees a growing market in training programmers from eastern Europe. That
for the Moscow programmers was aimed at giving them a thorough knowledge of
Paradox, a database language for PCs. 'The biggest obstacle was the language
barrier,' says Ian Lucas, ICOS training manager. 'All communication was
effectively carried out through Paradox. The computer became the tool with
which cultural and language barriers were demolished.'
Moscow will send over more programmers. ICOS has employed a Russian-speaking
instructor to help its east European push. ICOS: UK, 071 4940010.
