of records is subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Executive Order 12866. The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense has determined
that this Privacy Act rule for the Department of Defense does not constitute `significant regulatory action'. Analysis
of the rule indicates that it does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; does not create a serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; does not materially alter
the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; does not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or
the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866 (1993).






Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980. 

The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense certifies that this Privacy Act
rule for the Department of Defense does not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because it is concerned only with the administration of Privacy Act systems of records within the Department of Defense.






Paperwork Reduction Act. 

The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense certifies that this Privacy Act
rule for the Department of Defense imposes no information requirements beyond the Department of Defense and that
the information collected within the Department of Defense is necessary and consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552a, known
as the Privacy Act of 1974. 


The Department of the Navy is amending 32 CFR part 701, subpart G, paragraph (f) by revising the Navy organization name.
