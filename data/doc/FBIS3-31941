  [Text] Guatemala City, 29 Jan (AFP) -- Calm prevails in 
Guatemala tonight a few hours before the beginning of the 
referendum on constitutional reforms despite the tension on 28 
January. A Guatemala Fire Department spokesperson told AFP that 
"it has been one of the calmest days" the capital has ever 
experienced. Meanwhile, few vehicles are circulating in the 
streets. 
  On 28 January there was a great deal of tension and it was 
even announced there might be a fuel shortage. This led to 
hundreds of Guatemalans going to gasoline stations to fill their 
vehicles for the next few days. Nevertheless, the supply of 
gasoline has been normal, despite the announcement of a 
transportation strike next week, which, according to 
transportation owners, might provoke a fuel shortage. 
  Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio today warned that 
"we will intervene with transportation if it is halted." He also 
reiterated that the yes vote will win in tomorrow's referendum. 
  Polls indicate the yes vote will win. The constitutional 
reform will move up the election of a new Congress to this year. 
Nevertheless, uncertainty continues regarding the abstention 
rate in the referendum.
