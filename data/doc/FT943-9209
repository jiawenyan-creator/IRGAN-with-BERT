FT  12 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Shell
As far as their views on oil prices are concerned, BP and Shell seem
suddenly to have switched roles. BP, traditionally bullish, was distinctly
lukewarm last week while Shell, historically cautious, now appears more
upbeat. The change is curious since, as yesterday's interim figures showed,
Shell benefits less than BP from a higher oil price. Not only does Shell
have more downstream business, where margins tend to be squeezed when the
oil price rises; it also has more exposure to high tax rate countries, which
damps the earnings impact of price fluctuations.
Even allowing for that and for an undisclosed tax hit in the second quarter,
the fall in Shell's exploration and production earnings compared with the
first three months was disappointing. Nor was there much sign of the
benefits of Shell's cost-cutting programme, but then it was always
unrealistic to expect the same sort of transformation being wrought at BP,
given that Shell was much more efficient to start with.
For oil price bulls, there is greater upside in BP which is also more geared
to recovery in European petrochemicals while Shell will suffer more pain
from the slump in east Asian refining margins. Although BP's share price has
outperformed Shell's over the past two years, it still stands at a fat
earnings discount which is increasingly hard to justify.
