  [Text] Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa stated that 
if Cuba sticks to its decision to not allow any political 
refugees out of the island, Chile will have to review the 
negotiations currently under way with that country to solve the 
problem. 
  Figueroa thus referred to the hardening of the Cuban stance 
regarding eight Cuban citizens who remain in the Chilean 
Consulate in Havana. According to press reports, Fidel Castro's 
government has stated that it will never authorize the people 
who occupy foreign embassies by force to leave the country, even 
if they decide to abandon them voluntarily. 
  Figueroa said that a communique in this sense represents a 
change of Castro's original offer to grant the refugees exit 
visas. Figueroa also reasserted the Chilean Government's 
decision to continue giving them protection for humanitarian 
reasons and to see that no reprisals are adopted against them if 
the eight Cubans decide to voluntarily leave the consulate. 
  In Havana, in addition to the eight Cubans who have sought 
asylum at the Chilean Consulate, there are another 107 in the 
Belgium Embassy and 21 in the German Embassy.
