  [Text] Dionisios Kalamvrezos, the Greek consul in Moscow, 
stated that the majority of Greeks who were evacuated during 
military actions in Abkhazia and sent to their historic homeland 
were gradually returning to their places of permanent residence. 
The Greek authorities are not preventing the return to Abkhazia 
of refugees from among their compatriots. However, they are 
demanding appropriate guarantees for their security. 
  According to figures given by the consulate, there were 
between 16,000 and 17,000 Greeks living in Abkhazia before the 
outbreak of the war. The total number remaining there today is 
3,000.
