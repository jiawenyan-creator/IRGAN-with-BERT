FT  21 FEB 92 / Brazil tries to draw foreign investors
BRAZIL is to alter its privatisation programme rules in an attempt to
attract foreign investors, so far conspicuous by their absence, writes
Christina Lamb from Rio de Janeiro.
Almost all the Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 970m) raised through state sell-offs
last year consisted of domestic debt swapped at face value. Only 0.3 per
cent was in the form of foreign debt instruments, which carry a fixed 25 per
cent discount. According to Ms Maria Silvia Bastos Marques, an adviser on
the privatisation programme, it is this discount that has deterred foreign
investors.
'All the foreign banks we speak to complain they are being discriminated
against and as a result there has really been no foreign participation,'
said Ms Marques yesterday.
Under a Brazilian Senate resolution, foreign debt instruments must be
discounted in conversion operations. However, under the new rules to be
introduced by mid-March the value of the discount will be determined by
auction, with a minimum of 5 per cent.
Auctions will be held quarterly for options to convert foreign debt in the
next three month's privatisations.
The National Development Bank (BNDES), which is co-ordinating the programme,
has altered other rules to attract foreign participation.
The two year lock-in period during which foreigners were required to
maintain shares in privatised companies has been abolished and the period
for which the money must remain in the country has been reduced from 12 to
six years.
BNDES officials have been anxious to change these rules before May, when
large companies from the petrochemical sector go on sale. This week an
auction for Goiasfertil, a loss-making fertiliser company, had to be
suspended because there were no buyers.
