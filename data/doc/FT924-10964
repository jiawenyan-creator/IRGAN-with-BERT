FT  28 OCT 92 / Blenheim rises 31% on French growth
BLENHEIM Group, the fast-growing organiser of exhibitions, yesterday
announced higher-than-expected profits helped by growth in France, its most
important market.
Blenheim reported a 31.8 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds
28.3m to Pounds 37.3m in the 12 months to August 31. The company is changing
its year-end and will report final results for the 16 months to 31 December.
Analysts expected profits of Pounds 34m and the shares added 13p to 533p. Mr
Neville Buch, chairman, said the results were 'very positive' given troubles
elsewhere in the media and advertising sectors.
Turnover increased 25.5 per cent to Pounds 153.3m, helped by a Pounds 13.5m
contribution from the bi-annual Batimat building supply exhibition, held in
France last November.
The proportion of operating profits from France almost doubled to 53 per
cent, or Pounds 24.6m. This was due to the timing of occasional events like
Batimat, which make geographical and timing comparisons unreliable.
Profits in the UK fell 7.2 per cent to Pounds 7.7m as recession affected the
company's smaller shows and housing-related exhibitions. US profits fell 13
per cent to Pounds 12.7m, although Mr Buch said the market was resilient,
and re-bookings by exhibitors stood at 85 per cent.
Exhibition space sold in the 12 months rose 12.1 per cent to just over 1m
square metres. But there were some signs Blenheim's growth may be slowing.
After announcing interim profits ahead 51 per cent to Pounds 27.8m, profits
in the second six months fell to Pounds 9.5m, almost unchanged on the
comparable period.
Net borrowings increased from Pounds 23.8m to Pounds 39.6m due to
acquisitions. Interest costs increased 25 per cent to Pounds 6m. But
interest cover improved to more than seven times, thanks to the rise in
operating profits.
Because most of the company's assets are intangible, and not included on the
balance sheet, Blenheim has negative shareholders' funds of Pounds 100.6m.
If intangibles are included, gearing increased slightly to 17 per cent.
Earnings per share increased 15.4 per cent to 27.8p. The company is
proposing a second interim dividend of 6.3p to make a total of 9p, a 14.9
per cent increase.
