FT  15 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: GUS speculation
Continued speculation that Great Universal Stores, the diversified retail,
property and financial group, is preparing to give a chunk of its Pounds
1.6bn cash pile back to shareholders inspired the shares to an ex-dividend
rise of 9 to 583p on turnover of 2.1m.
However, weekend press reports suggesting that only Pounds 500m worth of
shares would be bought back disappointed some analysts. One said a buy-back
of 10 per cent of the stock (at a cost of some Pounds 575m) would give only
a 5 per cent rise in earnings per share for 1994-95. Others were more
positive, suggesting that the GUS move - thought probable within the next
six months - was likely to be part of a wider restructuring. This could
include floating or selling its constituent parts, with the property and
financial services arms thought to be particularly eligible.
A weekend newspaper report saying that Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals group, was
discussing a strategic alliance with US competitor Pfizer saw the former's
share price jump 16 to 655p. Glaxo said the story was pure speculation but
the company would be unlikely to comment on such sensitive issues ahead of
the announcement of first-half figures on Thursday. Some analysts said a
co-operation deal in the US would make sense, particularly after last year's
US merger between Merck and Medco. The shares also benefited from a
reiterated NatWest buy recommendation and closed 12 up at 651p.
The war of words between LWT and its unwanted suitor, Granada, continued
yesterday. LWT urged shareholders to reject the revised hostile bid by
Granada Group saying the price was too low and there were few potential
savings. The final offer values LWT at around Pounds 776m or 750p per share,
an increase of nearly 30 per cent on the value of the original offer
launched on December 6. LWT's chairman, Sir Christopher Bland, said the
company was worth between 840p and 850p a share.
Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, described LWT's defence as
'strong on presentation but weak on content' and the Granada offer was
'demonstrably generous'. LWT shares held steady at 746p and Granada was firm
at 585p. Meanwhile, Yorkshire Tyne-Tees, whose share price has doubled since
the start of the year on the belief that it will be the next regional
television group to attract a predator, added a further 10 to 362p.
Oil major BP was restrained following heavy selling in New York on Friday.
Analysts said the company's post-results presentation in the US was badly
received and remained under pressure in spite of the sharp fall in
temperatures on both sides of the Atlantic. However, heavy US selling was
masked by a London buyer switching out of Shell Transport. BP ended the day
2 lower at 370p on turnover of 10m, while Shell slipped 5 to 735p.
Aran Energy, which analysts said has acreage adjacent to the big oil finds
west of the Shetlands, gained 1 3/4 to 29 3/4 p.
International conglomerate Hanson fell 6 to 282 1/2 p with some marketmakers
voicing concern over the growing disparity between the shares and the
warrants. The warrants dropped a quarter to 39 1/2 p on turnover of 8m.
Banks weakened with Abbey National falling 7 to 509p on profit-taking and
Lloyds Bank and TSB Group shedding 14 1/2 to 587p and 8 to 250 1/2 p
respectively after going ex-dividend. HSBC and Standard Chartered both
responded to the 4.5 per cent fall in the Hong Kong market. HSBC fell 23 to
987p and Standard 34 to 1265p.
The English generators were again in demand, basking in the positive comment
caused by the decision on Friday by Offer, the industry regulator, not to
refer the two companies to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. PowerGen
surged 9 to 550p and National Power 15 1/2 to 491p. Eastern Electricity,
which again announced the purchase of its own shares - 750,000 at 675.5p -
yesterday, slipped 2 to 676p. Other recs lost ground.
Chemicals group Courtaulds slipped 7 1/2 to 497 1/2 p after two securities
houses cut this year's profit forecasts for the company. UBS cut by Pounds
5m to Pounds 135m and James Capel reduced by Pounds 10m to Pounds 140m.
Unease about the departure of the current chairman weakened sentiment in
British Aerospace, the shares closing 4 lower at 539p.
Lines of stock were on offer in BBA, leaving the shares to drift 16 to
1022p. The group, which operates seven airports, reported a 5.4 per cent
increase in January passenger traffic against the same month a year earlier.
Market watchers said the figures were in line with expectations and had been
discounted.
Container leasing and trailer rental group Tiphook firmed 3 to 67p, on
suggestions, later confirmed, that this week's financial statement from the
group will be accompanied by details of boardroom changes. However, details
about the sale of its container division to US insurance and financial group
Transamerica are also expected. Tiphook confirmed after the close that Mr RN
Hambro had agreed to become non-executive chairman pending the appointment
of a new permanent chairman. The restructuring costs were put at Pounds
49.7m.
A block of 1.6m shares in United Biscuits were sold into the market at 337p
and subsequently placed at 340p. The stock slid 4 to 345p.
Packaging company Parkside made its market debut at a 12p premium to the
placing price and closed 2 higher at 124p.
