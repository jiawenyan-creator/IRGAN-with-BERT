  [Text] Defence Minister Wichit Sukmak yesterday dismissed 
as untrue a report that the armed forces are dissatisfied with 
this year's military budget which is half a percent less than 
last year's. 
  He said the armed forces understood the Government had 
problems of a higher priority to deal with. 
  Gen Wichit said it was unlikely all ministries could get as 
much money as they asked for since the Government had to 
emphasize other priorities such as investment for infrastructure 
projects. 
  "There are no problems with the armed forces " said the 
minister. 
  However, he said he would seek a bigger allocation for the 
military from the Government. 
  "Whether we will get it depends totally on the Government 
and 
its capacity to collect tax from people to pay for the budget," 
he said. 
  Gen Wichit said this year's military budget had increased by 
more than six billion baht from last year's.
