SOVIET TV TO MARK CHRISTMAS EVE WITH A SERMON TAPED BY SCHULLER 
The Rev. Robert H. Schuller said Saturday that the "high point" of his life 
came when he heard that a 15-minute sermon he taped earlier this month in 
Moscow would be aired on Soviet television tonight -- Christmas Eve. 
The broadcast by the Garden Grove televangelist will be the first of its kind 
to be shown to the 200 million viewers of state-owned Soviet television on a 
Christian holiday. 
Schuller said he received a telephone call early Saturday morning from Valentin 
Lazutkin, deputy chief of Gostelradio, the state television agency, informing 
him that the 15-minute sermon he videotaped during a three-day visit to Moscow 
in early December would be aired tonight at 10 p.m. in Moscow. 
"I don't think anything will happen in my life that will top this -- this will 
be the high point," said Schuller, pastor at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden 
Grove. "This makes me feel so good I could cry with joy." 
Because of the time difference, the Soviet broadcast will begin just as today's 
first service at the Crystal Cathedral is ending, and a moment of prayer will 
be offered for the Soviet viewers, he said.
