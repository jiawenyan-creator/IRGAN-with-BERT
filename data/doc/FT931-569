FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lord Tebbit receives libel damages
The New Statesman and Society magazine paid libel damages to Lord Tebbit
yesterday, for repeating an allegation that he had once said 'nobody with a
conscience votes Conservative'. Lord Tebbit had always vigorously denied
making the statement and had received 'substantial' damages over the
original libel.
The magazine apologised in open court for the annoyance and embarrassment
caused to Lord Tebbit, agreed to pay damages and legal costs and undertook
never to repeat the allegation.
