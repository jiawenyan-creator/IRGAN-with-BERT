WORLD IN BRIEF; 
ROMANIA; 
TROOPS SCUFFLE WITH CROWD OF PROTESTERS 
Troops and police scuffled with demonstrators outside the Romanian government 
headquarters in Bucharest, witnesses said. The government moved in hundreds of 
troops and military police and several armored personnel carriers to protect 
the huge building on Victory Square as about 500 protesters and onlookers 
milled outside. Tempers flared when supporters of pro-democracy hunger strikers 
marched to the doors of the building, where the strikers were meeting with 
government negotiators.
