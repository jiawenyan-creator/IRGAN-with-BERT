  [Text] The government is not prepared to abandon its idea 
of a single ballot paper for the April election despite the 
objections of the Freedom Alliance. The government's chief 
negotiator, Mr. Roelf Meyer, said a single ballot paper was the 
sole option in view of the extent of voter illiteracy and 
uncertainty. 
  During his talks with President F.W. de Klerk yesterday, 
King 
Goodwill Zwelithini of the Zulus repeated that separate ballot 
papers were a condition for the Zulu participation in the 
election. The question will be high on the agenda when the 
Freedom Alliance holds talks with the government and the ANC 
[African National Congress] tomorrow.
