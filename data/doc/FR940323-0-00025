Polyhedral Occlusion Bodies of Autographa Californica Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus; Exemption from the Requirement
of a Tolerance 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule establishes an exemption from the requirement of a pesticide tolerance for residues of the microbial pest
control agent 

Autographa californica

 nuclear polyhedrosis virus in or on all raw agricultural commodities. The product Gusano is an insecticidal virus
product containing the polyhedral occlusion bodies of the naturally occurring 

Autographa californica

 nuclear polyhedrosis virus (Family: Baculoviridae). This tolerance exemption was requested by Crop Genetics International.
This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of 

Autographa californica

 nuclear polyhedrosis virus.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE:

 This regulation becomes effective March 23, 1994.

<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES:

 Written objections, identified by the document control number, [PP 2F4089/R2036], may be submitted to: Hearing
Clerk (A-110), Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. M3708, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. A copy of any objections

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of June 10, 1992 (57 FR 24645), EPA issued a notice that it had received PP 2F4089 from Espro, Inc., requesting that 40
CFR part 180 be amended to establish a tolerance for acal (the company and product, renamed ``Gusano,'' have since
been acquired by Crop Genetics International, 10150 Old Columbia Rd., Columbia, MD 21046). Gusano contains the polyhedral
occlusion bodies of 

A. californica

 nuclear polyhedrosis virus and is proposed for use in or on all raw agricultural commodities when used to control the
alfalfa looper.


No comments were received in response to the notice of filing.


Residue Chemistry Data


Although Gusano bioinsecticide will be applied on a variety of vegetable and silvaculture crops at rates varying
from 5 to 50 grams per acre, residue chemistry data were not required. Such data were determined to be necessary only
if the submitted toxicology studies indicate that additional Tier II or III toxicology data would be required as specified
in 40 CFR 158.165(e). The submitted toxicology data for this use indicate that the product is of low mammalian toxicity;
therefore, Tier II or III data were not required. 


Toxicology Data


Toxicology data requirements in support of this exemption from the requirement of a tolerance were satisfied via
data waivers from the open scientific literature. These waivers include literature from an acute oral toxicity/pathogenicity
study in the rat, an acute pulmonary toxicity/pathogenicity study in the rat, an acute dermal toxicity study in the
rabbit, and a primary eye irritation study in the rabbit. Findings from the open scientific literature showed no toxic,
pathogenic, or adverse effects. 
Reference Dose (RfD) and maximum permissible intake (MPI) considerations are not relevant to this petition because
of the low toxicity and lack of pathogenicity or infectivity as reported in the open scientific literature.
Based on the information cited above, the Agency has determined that the potential acute toxicity/pathogenicity
of 

Autographa californica

 nuclear polyhedrosis virus is sufficiently low to support the proposed exemption from the requirement of a tolerance
on all raw agricultural commodities. Thus, a tolerance for the active ingredient 

Autographa californica

 nuclear polyhedrosis virus is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, 40 CFR part 180 is amended as
set forth below. 
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
