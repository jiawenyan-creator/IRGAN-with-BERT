FT  10 AUG 94 / France bans Islamist papers
France yesterday banned five Islamist publications and detained 36 people as
part of its clampdown on suspected Algerian Moslem fundamentalists. The
action is intended to prevent terrorist attacks in the wake of threatened
reprisals against France for its internment of 17 suspected Moslem
militants. The internments followed the deaths of five French citizens in
last week's attack on an embassy building in Algiers. The French interior
ministry justified yesterday's ban by claiming that distribution of the
publications 'could endanger public order because of their violently
anti-western and anti-French tone and the calls for terrorism they contain'.
Paris police said 36 more people had been detained during a third successive
night of spot checks on vehicles and pedestrians. Monday night's detentions
took to more than 100 the number of people so far held for questioning.
Domestic criticism of the clampdown was muted, although the opposition
Socialist party demanded that the government expand contacts with moderate
Moslems in Algeria. Mr Charles Pasqua, interior minister, argues, however,
that there is no choice but to back Algeria's military-led government or see
extreme fundamentalists take power.
