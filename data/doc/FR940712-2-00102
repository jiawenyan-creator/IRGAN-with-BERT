<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.
Relating to European-Term and Cross-Rate Customized Foreign Currency Options</DOCTITLE>


July 5, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on April 12, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the Phlx. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b4 of the Act, proposes to amend pending new Rule 1069
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 to provide for the ability to: (1) Trade European-term option contracts on any foreign currency on which the Phlx currently
trades foreign currency options (``FCOs''); (2) trade cross-rate FCOs on any two such approved currencies; and (3)
allow users to quote all customized FCOs in percentage terms. Proposed Rule 1069, as well as existing Rules 1000, 1009,
1014, 1033, and 1034, would be amended accordingly. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office
of the Secretary, the Phlx, and at the Commission.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


On March 4, 1994, the Phlx filed with the Commission a proposal (File No. SRPhlx9411)
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 to allow FCO traders and their customers to have the ability, within specified limits, to designate their own option
exercise price parameters on a trade. In that filing, the Exchange proposed to allow its users to dictate the specific
strike price of an FCO contract that they would like to buy or sell without requiring the Exchange to continuously disseminate
quotes for these options. For example, if the Exchange has listed June .5450 and .5500 Deutsche mark calls and the customer
wants to trade June .5487 Deutsche mark calls, the customer could request a quote in this option and the trade could
occur. The Exchange, however, would not have to continuously disseminate quotes for this option until expiration
because this may be the only trade that ever occurs in this series.

The Exchange is now proposing to expand upon its proposed FCO customization contained in File No. SRPhlx9411.
If File No. SRPhlx9411 as well as the present proposal are approved, the Exchange would be able
to offer the ability for its participants to trade non-standardized strike prices on existing series of FCOs as well
as ``inverse'' or European-term contracts on those currencies presently listed on the Exchange, and cross-rate
contracts on any two of the existing eight currencies on which the Exchange presently lists FCOs (i.e.,

 the British pound, Swiss franc, French franc, Deutsche mark, Japanese yen, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar,
and European Currency Unit).


European-Term FCOs


The first addition to the array of previously proposed customized FCOs that the Exchange now proposes to offer is the
European-term contract. The Exchange presently lists options on eight foreign currencies. Each of these FCO contracts
is structured so that the trading currency is the U.S. dollar (

e.g.,

 French franc/U.S. dollar). The option is quoted in U.S. dollars per unit of the relevant foreign currency and the premium
is paid in U.S. dollars. Upon exercise of a call option, for example, the relevant foreign currency would be delivered.
The European-term customized FCO contract would be the inverse of the FCO contracts just described (

e.g.,

 U.S. dollar/French franc). The option will be quoted in units of the foreign currency per U.S. dollar and the premium
will be paid in the foreign currency. Because the underlying currency is the U.S. dollar, U.S. dollars will be delivered
upon exercise of a call option. The title of proposed Rule 1069
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 will be changed to ``Customized Options'' to reflect the fact that users will be able to customize FCO contracts in
more aspects than merely the strike price. Exchange Rule 1000(13), which provides the definition of ``foreign currency,''
will also be amended to include the U.S. dollar so that U.S. dollars may be considered an underlying foreign currency
under all applicable Exchange rules. Similarly, Rule 1009, which lists all of the approved underlying foreign currencies
would also be amended, as well as the definitions of ``spot sales price'' and ``forward sales price'' in Rules 1000(16)
and 1000(17).

Cross-Rate FCOs


The second proposed addition to the customized FCO facility proposed in File No. SRPhlx9411
would allow the Exchange to offer the ability to trade any cross-rate FCO contract on any two foreign currencies approved
for trading on the Exchange pursuant to Rule 1009.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 For example, an option on the Swiss franc/Canadian dollar could be traded. The Exchange believes, however, that it
would be inefficient to disseminate updated quotes on all of the possible combinations of cross-rate FCOs that could
be created by all of the listed currencies now available. The Exchange believes that most will not be of wide spread
interest but may appeal to only a limited number of customers or be active for only brief periods of time due to unpredictable
political or economic events in the U.S. and abroad.

The Exchange presently offers two standardized cross-rate FCOs, the Deutsche mark/Japanese yen and the British
pound/Deutsche mark. The Exchange also has approval to trade the British pound/Japanese yen, however, it has not
yet been made available for trading. See 

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29919 (November 7, 1991), 56 FR 58109 (November 15, 1991).
