ACTION: 

Amendment of Privacy Act systems of records notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Labor hereby amends its current Privacy Act systems of records notice to give notice of the creation
of flexible workplace pilot projects. These projects will mean that, for short periods of time, participating employees
will take copies of agency records to alternative worksites, including their homes or satellite offices, because
they will be working at these locations. However, all appropriate safeguards will be taken by these employees so that
the records will be safe. This amendment will occur by adding a new category to the General Prefatory Statement within
the notice.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In 1993 the Secretary of Labor authorized flexible workplace pilot projects for Department of Labor employees. Flexiplace
is a voluntary program which allows employees to work at home or at geographically convenient satellite offices for
part of the workweek with equipment provided by the Department.





Section (e)(4)(A) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(A)) requires, in part, that each agency publish in the 

Federal Register

 the location for each of its systems of records. Since employees in the Flexiplace Pilot Programs will be taking copies
of Departmental records to these additional locations, the category for SYSTEM LOCATION, for every system, must
be amended to reflect the additional locations made possible by the flexiplace pilot programs. The Department's
current Privacy Act Systems of Records Notice was published on September 23, 1993 at 58 FR 49548. This amendment will
be accomplished by adding a new paragraph to the existing General Prefatory Statement which appears in that notice.
The General Prefatory Statement contains provisions that apply to and are incorporated by reference into all the
Department's systems of records under the Privacy Act.



Amendment to Privacy Act Systems of Records Notice



The Department hereby amends its September 23, 1993 Privacy Act Systems of Records Notice, 58 FR 49548, by adding the
following text to the current General Prefatory Statement which Statement begins at page 49554 of Volume 58 of the


Federal Register

.



System Location_Flexiplace Pilot Programs



This paragraph applies to and is incorporated by reference into all of the Department's systems of records under the
Privacy Act, within the category entitled, SYSTEM LOCATION:

Pursuant to the Department of Labor's Flexiplace Pilot Programs, copies of records may be temporarily located at
alternative worksites, including employees' homes or at geographically convenient satellite offices for part
of the workweek. All appropriate safeguards will be taken at these sites.
