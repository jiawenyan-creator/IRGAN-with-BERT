(WFP) to help people afflicted by conflicts in the former 
Yugoslavia, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday [8 March].

million people in the strife-torn region, it said. 
  The people are suffering from a serious lack of food, daily 
goods, medical facilities, electricity, gas and water, the

can step up its aid.
