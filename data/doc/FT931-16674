FT  05 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei makes small gain
at start of 1993
INTEREST in equities was slack on the first trading day of the year, and the
Nikkei average gained marginally in the half-day session, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average finished 69.13 higher at 16,994.08 after a low of
16,875.09 and high of 17,034.01. Volume fell to 80m shares from the 113m
recorded on December 30. Declines led rises by 472 to 356, with 201 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 1.85 to
1,305.81, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 4.06 to 1,067.63.
A weak futures market prompted index-linked selling by arbitrageurs, which
was offset by public fund buying. Reports of financial assistance by the
authorities for ailing financial institutions over the holidays triggered
some short-term trading by dealers.
Taiheiyo Bank, a regional bank based in Tokyo, was the day's biggest gainer,
rising Y40 to Y339 on a report that the Bank of Japan will provide Y60bn for
its restructuring.
Nippon Housing Loan, the leading housing loan company, gained Y36 at Y318 on
reports that financial authorities were considering allowing ailing housing
loan companies to shift their bad loans to a new company.
Isuzu Motors was the most active stock, rising Y12 to Y344 on rumours of
changes in management.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 98.42 to 18,584.25 in volume of 12.1m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC RIM markets were generally stronger in the first session of the new
year. However, HONG KONG went against the trend after China again sought the
withdrawal of Governor Chris Patten's democratic reform proposals. The Hang
Seng index lost 74.59, or 1.35 per cent, to 5,437.80 in thin turnover of
HKDollars 956m.
BOMBAY was another loser in its first session for 10 days: the BSE index
slipped 75.70 to 2,539.67 but volume was reported to be low.
