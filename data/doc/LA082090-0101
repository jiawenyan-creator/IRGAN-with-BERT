DOWNING IS ANGEL OF WEEK 
Brian Downing, who was six for 15 with four runs batted in, has been named 
Angel of the Week by The Times' Orange County Edition. 
Downing also walked four times and scored four runs during the week as the 
Angels extended their winning streak to five. His home run on Wednesday against 
the New York Yankees was his 12th of the season and 246th of his career, 
placing him 98th on the all-time list. His batting average, now at .302, peaked 
at .307 during the week. 
A check for $250 in Downing's name will be given to the Boys and Girls Clubs of 
Orange County.
