FT  17 OCT 92 / International Company News: Westinghouse Electric shares
tumble to low
WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate, yesterday tried to quell Wall
Street rumours about its financial health by announcing that it was in
appliance with all covenants of its Dollars 6bn revolving credit agreement
and that its debt has received investment grade ratings.
In spite of the announcement, shares in Westinghouse tumbled Dollars 1 1/2
yesterday to a 52-week low of Dollars 11 3/4 . The stock closed at Dollars
14 3/4 on Monday.
Investors have been skittish about the stock since late Monday, when
Westinghouse announced an unexpected Dollars 155m pre-tax charge against
third-quarter earnings.
Earlier this week, Westinghouse's debt rating was downgraded by Standard &amp;
Poor's, the US credit ratings agency to reflect the continuing problems at
the financial services subsidiary. S&amp;P said, however, that the lower ratings
also reflect 'weak operating performance at the parent company and the
uncertain prospects'.
