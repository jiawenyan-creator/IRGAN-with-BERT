  [Text] [Announcer Grazyna Bukowska] We have a guest in our 
studio, Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and finance 
minister. Has Prime Minister Pawlak accepted your resignation? 
  [Borowski] Good evening, madam, good evening ladies and 
gentlemen. Well, this I do not know. I formally handed in my 
resignation; whether he accepted it, I don't know. Judging from 
the announcements, probably not yet. 
  [Bukowska] Is it possible that you could withdraw this 
resignation, and, if so, on what conditions? To put it more 
simply: Does the list of conditions you have already set have to 
be met from beginning to end, or is there any room for 
compromise? 
  [Borowski] I would like to say that this list of conditions, 
if that is what one can call them, is more in the form of 
proposals for a clear division of remits within the government, 
proposals of a demarcation of responsibilities, and proposals 
that envisage the fact that it is ministers who are responsible 
for what happens in their ministries, that one cannot go over 
their heads and dismiss individual officials. These proposals 
were already a compromise, and I personally believe it would be 
difficult to cross anything off that list. Anyway, to my mind, 
they are not in any way insulting to the prime minister; they 
are quite acceptable. 
  [Bukowska] Is this a conflict between your and Prime 
Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak, or is it a conflict on the SLD-PSL [Democratic 
Left Alliance-Polish Peasant Party] axis? 
  [Borowski] I would be the last to want to fan a large-scale 
conflict. I would very much not want this to happen. But I 
said at the conference, and it was even quoted here: This is not 
an isolated case; this is not a matter of the person of the 
dismissed deputy minister; this is a matter of principle, a 
matter of loyalty in our cooperation. As I have already said, 
one can hold various posts, but one can only save one's face. 
And, in this sense, one could say that this is a conflict 
between the prime minister and me. But, taking into account the 
matters of remits of which I spoke, the conlict is of a much 
broader nature. 
  [Bukowska] In your opinion, does the coalition have a chance 
of surviving this crisis? 
  [Borowski] I would like to believe so, if I am to be honest. 
Anyway, I have already said this at a news conference: There are 
no irreplaceable people. I think a different solution could be 
found. 
  [Bukowska] You also said during your news conference that 
you 
and the prime minister have different viewpoints regarding the 
economy. Was it really thus? How did this manifest itself? 
  [Borowski] I must say that this is not perhaps so very 
strange. It would be difficult for the SLD and the PSL to have 
identical viewpoints on the economy. It is well known that 
there are differences. There were also differences between the 
prime minister and me. But the way of agreeing stands was not 
good. That is, it just did not exist. In other words, the 
statements of various ministers, sometimes even unfortunately 
those of the prime minster himself, diverged from the agreed 
line. 
  [Bukowska] Were these differences so weighty, so 
significant, that it was impossible to come to any 
understanding? What were the most important ones? 
  [Borowski] Well, that is just it. We sought agreement and, 
with Chairman Kwasniewski, we found...[pauses] I must say that 
Chairman Kwasniewski showed great energy in this case and great 
initiative in order to bring about such agreement. 
  [Bukowska] I am sorry, Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, but you 
have not answered my question. I was asking about differences 
in matters of the economy. 
  [Borowski] Well you see, madam, this is the sort of question 
that, should I begin to give answers to, I could basically spoil 
what lies before us, and it is not my intention to raise the 
temperature in this situation. We have to discuss these 
differences calmly among ourselves. 
  [Bukowska] Finally, one more question. Are these really two 
parties that merely govern together, or is it really a coalition? 
  [Borowski] Well, certain problems do come about, as do 
various difficulties. This is one of them. Chairman 
Kwasniewski said, I think yesterday, that there is no real 
alternative to this coalition in the Sejm, and I think that, to 
a great extent, he is right. There is, after all, a certain 
closeness between the PSL and the SLD. I personally have a great 
deal of liking for the PSL deputies, and I believe that this 
coalition should find a way out of this situation. 
  [Bukowska] Thank you very much for the interview. The guest 
was Marek Borowski.
