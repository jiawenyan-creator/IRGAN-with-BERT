FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sales growth helps turnround at
DSM
Strong demand fuelled by European economic recovery enabled DSM, the Dutch
chemicals group, to stage a turnround to a net profit of Fl 114m (Dollars
67.4m) in the third quarter, from a net loss of Fl 52m in the same period of
1993.
The sharp improvement was caused mainly by a 13 per cent rise in sales
volumes, particularly for polymers and caprolactam, a raw material used to
make nylon.
Turnover rose 13 per cent, to Fl 2.15bn from Fl 1.90bn.
Selling prices rose by an average 2 per cent, but this was offset by the
negative effects of divestments and by lower exchange rates, particularly
for the dollar.
The buoyant demand for polymers and other DSM products kept the group's
plants operating at high utilisation rates, the company said.
The unusually good results in the third quarter, which is traditionally a
weak period because of the summer holidays and slacker production at DSM's
industrial customers, took net profit for the first nine months of the year
to Fl 295m.
This compares with a net loss of Fl 42m a year earlier. Nine-month turnover
was up 8.7 per cent at Fl 6.63bn from nearly Fl 6.1bn in the first quarters
of 1993.
The result was in line with forecasts by analysts, who had predicted a net
result above Fl 100m for the quarter.
DSM forecast that sales volumes would remain strong in the final quarter,
while selling prices and margins should also be higher on average than in
the third quarter.
This is expected to lead to a further increase in fourth-quarter net profit,
before extraordinary items, compared with the third quarter, in spite of the
prospect of significant maintenance shutdowns.
Mr Simon de Bree, chairman, said the lower dollar trend was a cause for
concern, but added this was not expected to have any significant negative
effect in the short term.
