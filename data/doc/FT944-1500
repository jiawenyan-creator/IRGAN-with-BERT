FT  20 DEC 94 / People: Inntrepreneurs lose out
The recent loss by Grand Metropolitan, the drinks and foods group, of the
management contract of Inntrepreneur Estates, the UK pub joint venture
between Grand Met and Foster's Brewing of Australia, has left some 15 senior
managers without jobs.
The rest of the 280 staff of Grand Metropolitan Estates, the subsidiary
running IEL, will transfer to IEL which is to have its own management
reporting to the two shareholders, Grand Met and Courage, the UK brewing
subsidiary of Foster's.
The three most senior departees from Grand Met Estates are: Robert Williams,
chairman and managing director, Peter Coleman, director of legal affairs and
company secretary, Mike Newman, pubic relations director, and Bill Fox,
Rodney Mann and John Norris, who are three of the regional managers.
Grand Met had managed IEL since the two partners pooled their pubs in 1991.
It has been criticised by publicans, lobby groups and politicians for
running Inntrepreneur more like a property company than a pub business. Some
licensees have campaigned through the courts against the terms of their
leases.
Courage, chaired by Michael Foster, was thought to have been dissatisfied
with the management arrangement. When the joint venture was refinanced again
in November, Grand Met relinquished its management role.
IEL is seeking a chief executive and several other senior managers. Although
IEL will run independently, Courage is planning to play an active role in an
attempt to improve relations with IEL's licensees.
