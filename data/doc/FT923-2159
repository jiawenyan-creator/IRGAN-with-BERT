FT  18 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Investors abandon utilities
THE apparent abandonment of the low-inflation economic environment brought
an abrupt about turn in sentiment in those sectors regarded as safe havens
and, in particular, among the utilities.
The electricity distribution stocks, the water sector, BT and to a lesser
extent British Gas, all came under substantial selling pressure from the
outset of trading as the market's action funds switched their allegiance to
the cyclical stocks.
Opening at 357p, BT shares quickly turned down, touching a low of 332p
before settling a net 4 off at 339 1/2 p. The partly-paid stock closed 3 1/2
down at 237p. Turnover in the two classes of shares was 19m and 7.1m
respectively.
British Gas, refecting the stock's underperformance against the other
utilities, was treated with kid gloves, the shares edging up 4 1/2 to 235p
on 17m traded.
The biggest casualties in the electricity stocks included Norweb, 10 lower
at 406p, Midland, 12 off at 390p, and Yorkshire, which declined 16 to 418p.
Footsie status sustained Thames Water, only 4 easier at 426p, and Severn
Trent, 6 down at 385p, but the smaller water issues such as South West (17
weaker at 396p) and Welsh Water (13 cheaper at 430p) were given a much
rougher ride.
Guinness volatile
In a session notable for demand for international stocks, drinks group
Guinness, the 'classic overseas earner', stood out for its underperformance
after reporting interim figures below market estimates and warning of
deteriorating markets. Analysts downgraded their forecasts for the full
year.
Half-time profits showed a one per cent improvement to Pounds 353m but the
figure fell short of market expectations of between Pounds 359m and Pounds
366m, and the company spoke of poor trading conditions in the UK, Japan and
Germany.
With the strong demand for internationals a particular feature of
yesterday's session, shares in Guinness, which derives around 85 per cent of
its earnings from overseas, still suffered an initial retreat of 38 to 491p
on the results as dealers moved to unload stock and analysts made their
downgrades. Smith New Court was among brokers to cut its forecast and is now
predicting profits of Pounds 975m for the year, down from its previous
estimate of Pounds 1.03bn.
The strong market trend, however, brought a rebound in the shares, which
reached 560p before profit-taking combined with switching into Grand
Metropolitan cut them back to 534p for a rise on the day of 5. Turnover came
to 17m shares, the highest daily total for 15 months.
The switching between Guinness and GrandMet, together with demand for
overseas earners, saw turnover in the latter rise to 14m as the shares
jumped 23 to close at 432p.
The oil and gas sector attracted exceptionally heavy trading. BP saw 31m
shares dealt as an initial burst of buying interest, mostly from overseas
according to dealers, was offset by a steady stream of big selling orders
from UK institutions. Pushed up to 226p within minutes of the opening, BP
shares were subsequently driven down and closed the session a mere 1 1/2 up
at 212p.
Shell, on the other hand, was the darling of the big international
institutions, with the shares running up 29 1/2 to 522p on 15m traded.
The latest upsurge in the exploration and production sub-sector saw Lasmo
climb 13 1/2 to 146p on very heavy turnover of 12m and Enterprise add 19 at
384p on 2.9m, reflecting the impact of currencies on crude oil prices which,
because of currency shifts, have risen from around Pounds 10 a barrel to
Pounds 12 a barrel in the past couple of weeks.
Burmah Castrol's exceptionally heavy overseas earnings stream - 30 per cent
comes directly from the US, to say nothing of substantial income from
Germany - saw the shares advance 22 to 613p.
Institutions piled back into the high street banks after the recent interest
rate rises were rescinded and the market began to trade on stories that
single-figure interest rates are not too far away.
National Westminster and Barclays, which bore the brunt of selling in the
sector earlier in the week, spiralled upwards in levels of turnover not seen
for many months. The latter shot up 45 to 336p on 28m traded, while NatWest
leapt 51 to 357p on 26m.
The expected return to profits underpinned Legal &amp; General, which settled 24
up at 323p. Prudential, where turnover was given a big push by a single
trade of 4.9m shares at 246p, closed 6 higher at 245p.
Steep gains in the equity market and hopes of an upturn in the property
market drove the composite sector higher. Sun Alliance added 24 at 263p,
Commercial Union 14 at 489P, General Accident 38 at 478p and Royal 16 at
142p.
There was no hard evidence to support the latest spurious market rumours
that Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, had taken advantage of the
market upsurge to place the remainder of the big block of ICI shares it
acquired from Hanson via a bought deal earlier this year. ICI shares
finished 38 better at 1105p after turnover of 5.1m.
Reed International's proposed merger with Elsevier was given a warm welcome
by the market, which marked Reed shares up 45 to 531p. Volume was 8.8m.
With the focus mainly on internationals, several stocks viewed as
over-focused on the UK came under pressure. One such stock was Northern
Foods, which was among a handful of FT-SE stocks to buck the market trend.
The shares shed 3 to 224p.
Also relatively weak was Argyll Group, currently hosting a series of broker
visits. The shares improved only 3 to 307p.
Investors brushed aside the financial worries that have depressed Queens
Moat Houses of late and strong demand left the shares 7 1/2 ahead at 35p.
Hotels group Forte was seen as likely to benefit from a devaluation of
sterling and trade in the shares was particularly busy. They rose 21 to 139p
as turnover reached 21m.
British Steel was particularly busy and recorded the day's highest volume
among Footsie stocks at more than 47m. The shares rose 8 to 61p.
