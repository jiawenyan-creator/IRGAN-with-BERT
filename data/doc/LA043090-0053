TWO KILLED, TWO WOUNDED IN WEEKEND GUNFIRE 
Two men were shot to death Sunday in separate incidents, and two other people 
were wounded by gunfire -- including a teen-age boy who was shot by a 
California Highway Patrol officer after being stopped in a car that allegedly 
had been stolen, authorities said. 
A gunman opened fire in the 600 block of South Alvarado Street near MacArthur 
Park, striking Jose Mejia, 31, once in the head, police said. He was pronounced 
dead at the scene, officers said. 
A 22-year-old man who was not identified was shot in the chest. He was listed 
in critical condition at County-USC Medical Center. 
Both men were standing in front of a hamburger stand at 5:40 a.m. when a 
four-door black vehicle drove up, investigators said. As Mejia approached the 
car, a passenger sitting in the rear shot him, police said. 
The gunman then got out of the car and chased the second victim, shooting him 
once in the chest. Investigators said they have no motive for the shooting and 
no arrests have been made. 
A 32-year old man was shot and killed by apparent robbers as he fished with two 
friends on a jetty in Marina del Rey early Sunday, police said. Detectives said 
two assailants attempted to rob the victim, whose identity was not disclosed, 
and killed him during the attempt. 
A 14-year old boy was shot and wounded by a CHP officer who had stopped the boy 
and a companion at Imperial Highway and Mariposa Avenue in an unincorporated 
area of Los Angeles County. Investigators said the boys were in a stolen car. 
The wounded boy was shot in the head and was listed in critical but stable 
condition at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, a hospital spokesman 
said. 
"It's too early to determine what happened," CHP spokesman Ernie Garcia said 
Sunday evening. "We have just started to interrogate everyone." 
The second boy was taken into custody, Garcia said. He did not disclose the 
charges.
