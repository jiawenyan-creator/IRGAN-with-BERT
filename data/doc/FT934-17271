FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Paribas stable at FFr1.1bn
midway
PARIBAS, the French banking group, yesterday announced that net profits
stabilised at FFr1.12bn (Dollars 193m) in the first half of this year
because of the recession in France.
The news of static profits comes at a time when the group - the leading
force in French investment banking - is recovering from 1991, when it made a
loss for the first time.
Paribas, which includes the Credit du Nord retail banking network, came back
into the black last year, but its recovery was checked in the first half of
this year.
Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman, said yesterday that the group's market trading
activities had fared well during the first half, but its banking interests
had been affected by the depressed state of the European market, which had
triggered a steep increase in provisions.
Net banking income rose by 32.9 per cent to FFr16.5bn in the first six
months this year from FFr12.42bn in the corresponding period last year.
This was helped by a strong performance from the Banque Paribas investment
bank in its trading activities, and from the Compagnie Bancaire specialist
finance business.
However, the group suffered a sharp decline of 78.8 per cent in additional
income to FFr745m from FFr3.52bn.
This was mainly due to a reduction in proceeds from share sales and a poor
performance from some of its associate companies, including Ciments
Francais, the loss-making cement group.
Gross operating profits increased by 11.3 per cent to FFr7.8bn, from
FFr7.01bn.
The group was forced to raise provisions by 34 per cent to FFr3.55bn from
FFr4.75bn because of its difficulties in the banking market and the French
property sector.
Paribas wrote down part of Banque Paribas' exposure on loans to developing
countries, an issue that has recently affected other French banks, including
Banque Nationale de Paris.
