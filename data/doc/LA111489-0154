WORLD; 
REBELS WIN IN NAMIBIA ELECTION 
A group that fought a guerrilla war with South Africa finished first in 
elections that will lead Namibia to independence, but failed to win enough 
votes to claim total power, unofficial results showed today. 
Thousands of people who were pleased that the South-West Africa People's 
Organization at least won a majority thronged the streets of the capital and 
adjoining townships today, waving flags, singing and honking horns. 
"We are very happy. We struggled all the years for this day," said Sam Nujoma, 
president of the black nationalist group.
