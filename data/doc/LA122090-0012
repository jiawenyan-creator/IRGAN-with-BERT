SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO 
The son of television evangelist Morris Cerullo pleaded guilty Wednesday to 
grand theft in the attempted theft of an air conditioner from a store. 
Rather than face a retrial, Mark Stephen Cerullo, 33, of San Diego, pleaded 
guilty to the felony charge before San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus 
Rodriguez. 
A jury acquitted Cerullo on Dec. 10 of burglary in the same July 29 incident at 
the Home Depot on Sports Arena Boulevard. 
Jurors deadlocked 9-3 for acquittal on the grand theft charge. 
Cerullo's sentencing was scheduled for Jan. 18. He remains free on $4,000 bond 
previously posted.
