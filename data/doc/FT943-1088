FT  26 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Norman Hay reduces losses to Pounds 368,000
Norman Hay, the engineering group, reduced losses from Pounds 677,000 to
Pounds 368,000 in the first half of 1994.
The result came on the back of a lower turnover of Pounds 3.24m, against
Pounds 3.9m.
Mr Peter Hay, chairman, warned, however, that the company's performance
would be held back by financing costs until the sale of the Heathrow site
was concluded.
Further progress was expected in the second half and prospects 'appear
better than for several years,' he added.
Losses per share for the period amounted to 2.5p, compared with 4.5p.
