FT  17 JUL 92 / Peking is pressed on trade rows
MRS Carla Hills, US trade representative, is pressing China to resolve a
list of trade disputes by mid-August, well ahead of an October 10 deadline
set last year, Nancy Dunne writes from Washington.
Mr Michael Moskow, her deputy, said yesterday that Mrs Hills had given the
Chinese government a list of trade issues she wants resolved during talks in
Beijing starting on August 17. Otherwise she will publish a list of
potential sanctions and begin public hearings.
President George Bush, who has been portrayed as being soft on China, could
gain politically should the US retaliate in October or win substantial
concessions from Beijing.
It is usual to begin any retaliatory process once a deadline has passed.
However, Mr Moskow said a similar threat produced an agreement with Beijing
on intellectual property rights earlier this year.
