FT  04 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Kwik Save
Yesterday's figures from Kwik Save were impressive - almost heroically so in
the light of the fierce competition in UK food retailing. Pre-tax profits
were better than expected and gross margins improved. All credit to the
management's success in squeezing costs, putting pressure on suppliers and
keeping a tight grip on cash.
The problem is that the strategic challenge facing the group is enormous. J
Sainsbury and Tesco have deflected the threat posed by discounters with
their carefully targeted price reduction programmes. Having already pared
its own prices, Kwik Save is left with limited scope to respond. It will
seek to challenge the majors in high margin areas such as chilled food, and
to copy them by selling a higher proportion of own-label products. But
competition with the superstores will highlight the relative inadequacy of
Kwik Save's offering when product range and customer service as well as
price are taken into account.
Kwik Save thus faces a steady decline in core profitability which its
aggressive store-opening plans - and opportunistic acquisitions such as that
of Shoprite - will not be able to reverse. Kwik Save is better able to deal
with the deteriorating climate than other discounters, but that is no
recommendation when shares in Sainsbury are valued only in line with the
market.
