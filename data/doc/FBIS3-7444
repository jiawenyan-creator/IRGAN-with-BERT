  [Text] Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- Feelings of reverence 
for the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il are daily growing among 
South Korean people and soldiers of the puppet Army, according 
to the Seoul-Based Radio Voice of National Salvation [VNS]. 
  Yi Suk-kyong, a teacher of a high school in Inchon, when she 
was asked by her students at the geography lesson which is the 
strongest country in the world, replied that she thought it is 
the North. She further said: 
  Whether a country is strong or weak does not depend on the 
size of its territory, population and the level of arms 
equipment. 
  The North is so strong because it is under the guidance of 
General Kim Chong-il, a peerless famous general. 
  He is a great brilliant commander of varied attainments with 
literary and military accomplishments and iron will. 
  It is a great fortune and pride of our nation that we have 
held General Kim Il-song, a legendary hero of the anti-Japanese 
armed struggle, and General Kim Chong-il, another matchless 
general, together in high esteem. 
  A university professor in Taejon said with a strong emotion 
to his students: 
  General Kim Chong-il is the great master of military affairs 
who has developed the People's Army into unrivalled ranks by 
unfolding a new chapter of army building. 
  A First Lieutenant Kim of the 27th Division of the puppet 
Army said to his colleagues: 
  The Yankees try to kindle a war against the North. But we 
must live with our own minds. 
  No army on earth equals the People's Army which has 
developed 
into a one-match-for-a-hundred strong army under the guidance of 
General Kim Chong-il, the supreme commander with matchless grit, 
iron will and invincible stamina. 
  We must not serve the United States as its mercenaries but 
become genuine defenders of our country with General Kim 
Chong-il as the supreme commander of the national Army.
