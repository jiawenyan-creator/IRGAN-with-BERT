FT  15 MAY 92 / Observer: Over to you
John Snow and John Price, and that's just for openers . . .Fred Rumsey will
be on hand as first change. Any cricketing capitalists who feel up to facing
the ex-England pace bowlers, should call John Ayling on 071-439 6070.
He's drumming up an FT Business XI to take on the Lord's Taverners, under
former Test captain Mike Denness, at the Oval on Saturday June 27. First
come, first picked, he says - although WPP's Martin Sorrell is already
booked to play (not necessarily in the slips).
The only catch, before the game starts at least, is that playing will cost a
charitable donation of at least Pounds 2,000.
