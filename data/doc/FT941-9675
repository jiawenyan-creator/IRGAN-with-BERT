FT  14 FEB 94 / Environment commissioner urges tax on timber
The European Union should introduce a tax on timber to reflect the
environmental cost of cutting down forests, according to Mr Ioannis
Paleokrassas, environment commissioner.
'Timber is a resource we could price more correctly,' he said. 'If we carry
on as we are, forests will be decimated.'
A timber tax would be graded according to the origin of the timber, he said
in London last week. Timber from old, native forests would be taxed more
heavily than that from replanted forests.
The tax would apply both to imports and to wood from Europe. He denied it
would conflict with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
His comments drew a sharp response from Brazilian timber exporters. Mr Claes
Hall, European spokesman for Brazil's Cellulose Exporters Association
(Abecel), said: 'We grow timber in plantations like a crop - any tax should
recognise the difference between this and wood from native forests, and
plantation timber or products made from it should not be taxed.'
Finland's ministry of external economic relations said such a tax could
affect timber exports, though Finland believed it managed its forest better
than do many countries.
