  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 16 (CTK) -- If a government bill on 
calling early elections this June is not passed the collection 
of signatures for calling a referendum on early elections will 
start as of Monday, February 21, Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar 
told parliament today. 
  350,000 signatures are required to call a referendum to 
decide whether or not early elections are held. After 
signatures are collected, the date of a referendum will be set. 
  "The government coalition of the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS) and part of the Slovak National Party (SNS) 
agree on the need for calling early elections given the unstable 
political situation in Slovakia," Meciar said. He said he did 
not understand why the opposition does not want to first hold 
parliamentary elections in June and only after them local 
elections in November, adding that this is the case when 
subjective party interests are being placed over the objective 
needs of the state. 
  Meciar said that it should be considered whether a 
proportional or a majoritarian system of election is introduced 
and whether to preserve the current one-chamber parliament or to 
create a two-chamber one. 
  Meciar said he supported the new election law which allowed 
ethnic minorities to be represented in parliament and believed 
that a paragraph about the so-called imperative mandates is 
included in the law to terminate the mandates of "turncoat" 
deputies. 
  Meciar called on deputies to vote in the "interests of the 
state" for the government bill on early elections and the 
shortening of the electoral term.
