  [Excerpt] Just like the past few days, the worst situation 
today on the Bosnia-Herzegovina fronts was in the operational 
zone of the 7th South Operative Group. Smajl Terzic reports 
from the press center: 
  [Terzic] In the last 14 days, 160 Chetniks have been killed 
and twice as many put out of action. Fierce attacks took place 
today in the Filipovici region, Komin, Obli Kamen, and Kriz, 
where the enemy fired over 800 82-mm shells. The reasons for 
this are revenge and the withdrawal of damaged tanks and an 
armored personnel carrier. [passage omitted]
