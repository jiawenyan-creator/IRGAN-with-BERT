INFLATION DATA SENDS BOND PRICES LOWER 
Bond prices tumbled Wednesday, driven lower by news of the biggest jump in 
consumer prices in two years and the inflationary fears it stirred. 
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell about 5/8 point, or $6.25 for 
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction 
from its price, rose to 9.12% from 9.05% late Tuesday. 
The government reported that consumer prices rose 0.6% in December as the cost 
of fuel, food and other items shot up. The rise in the Labor Department's 
consumer price index followed moderate 0.3% increases in November and December. 
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government 
issues declined 5/32 point to 9/32 point, intermediate maturities fell 3/8 
point to 1/2 point and long-term issues lost 23/32 point, according to figures 
provided by Telerate Inc. 
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, dropped 4.03 to 1,122.66. In corporate trading, industrials also fell. 
Moody's investment-grade corporate bond index, which measures price movements 
on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was down 0.76 at 
296.90. 
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.82% as the discount increased 2 
basis points to 8.52%. Yields on six-month bills slipped to 8.97% as the 
discount edged down 1 basis point to 8.48%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 
9.33% as the discount jumped 7 basis points to 8.62%. 
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 10%, up from 9.318% late Tuesday.
