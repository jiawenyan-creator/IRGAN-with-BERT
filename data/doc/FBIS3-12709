  [Text] Sanaa, 27 Feb (INA)- A source at the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping [YRG], one of the three ruling coalition parties in 
Yemen, has denied reports of its complicity in military 
incidents that occurred in the Yemeni Governorate of Abyan last 
Monday. 
  In a statement to the press in Sanaa last night, the source 
asserted that the YRG has never been a party in any bloody 
military dispute among the sons of Yemen. 
  Press reports had accused the grouping of sending armed men 
to escalate the military incidents against the Yemeni Socialist 
Party's supporters in the Abyan Governorate.
