OFFICIALS: KUWAIT IS 'SOUTHERN IRAQ' 
Saddam Hussein's government is now calling Kuwait City one of the "cities of 
southern Iraq" after annexing the oil-rich emirate. 
Baghdad at first installed a "provisional government of free Kuwait," which in 
turn declared a "republic" just 24 hours before Iraq's Aug. 2 annexation. 
Iraqi spokesmen are now referring to "Kuwait, al-Jahra . . . and other cities 
of southern Iraq."
