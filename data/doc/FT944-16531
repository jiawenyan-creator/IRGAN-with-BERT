FT  13 OCT 94 / Aristide return on schedule
Lieutenant-General Raoul Cedras, the leader of Haiti's military coup who
relinquished power on Monday, was expected to leave the country yesterday
just three days before the scheduled return of exiled president
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
United States military forces continued to guard the home of the ousted
general as removal vans loaded with Gen Cedras's valuables headed towards
aircraft awaiting him at the capital city's airport. A US embassy spokesman
said that only some 'peripheral and marginal issues' about his departure had
to be worked out, most notably to which country he would be taken to.
Argentina, Panama and El Salvador have been mentioned as possible
destinations. The spokesman also said that the chief coup strategist,
General Pillipe Biamby, was likely to accompany Gen Cedras into exile. Gen
Cedras's expected departure follows the collapse of the government led by de
facto president Emile Jonassaint, who left the presidential palace on
Tuesday. All of Mr Jonassaint's ministers also abandoned their offices, and
US troops peacefully secured 15 different government buildings. Inside the
presidential palace, US security officers and Mr Aristide's transition team
began initial preparations to receive the legitimate president when he
arrives on Saturday.
