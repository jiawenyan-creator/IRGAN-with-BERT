  [Text] In a seemingly all-out war waged by the national 
government, the Santa Cruz Special Antinarcotics Force has 
summoned Susana Seleme, a former secretary to the president of 
the Republic [Jaime Paz Zamora]; Rolando Arostegui, a former 
Santa Cruz mayor under the Patriotic Accord administration; 
Carlos Valverde, a former Interior Ministry intelligence 
department chief and a former assistant to [former Interior 
Minister] Guillermo Capobianco; Orlando Elmer Saucedo, the 
Interior Ministry seizures department chief during Capobianco's 
tenure; and other officials whose names we were unable to obtain.
