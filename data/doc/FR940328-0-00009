The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its regulations to correct the address for FDA's Dockets Management

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the 

Federal Register

 of June 10, 1991 (56 FR 26688), FDA announced the relocation of the Dockets Management Branch, effective June 14, 1991,
and listed its new address as the ``Dockets Management Branch (HFA305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
123, 12420 Parklawn Dr. Rockville, MD 20857.'' In this document, FDA is amending certain portions of its regulations
to reflect the correct address.


Publication of this document constitutes final action on these changes under the Administrative Procedure Act (5
U.S.C. 553). Notice and public procedure are unnecessary because FDA is merely correcting nonsubstantive errors.
