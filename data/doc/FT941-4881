FT  09 MAR 94 / WPP to reduce debt by sale of minority interest
WPP, the marketing services group, yesterday announced it is likely to float
part of its market research businesses this year, yielding up to Dollars
200m (Pounds 137m), as part of its efforts to cut debt.
The announcement came as the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 54.4m
for the year ended December 31, 1993, up sharply from Pounds 7.8m in 1992.
The latest pre-tax profit figure is after charging a loss of Pounds 10.9m on
the sale of companies, against Pounds 28.9m of exceptional items a year
earlier .
A final dividend of 0.65p will make a total payout of 1p per share for 1993
 -the first year a dividend will have been paid since 1990. Fully diluted
earnings per share were 3.4p. The shares rose 2p to close at 125p.
Operating profit for the group - which includes advertising agencies J
Walter Thompson, and Ogilvy and Mather - was up 34 per cent to Pounds 95m,
while operating margins increased from 5.6 per cent to 6.7 per cent.
Billings rose 12 per cent to Pounds 6bn and revenues rose 12 per cent to
Pounds 1.4bn.
Forecasts from the group were cautious yesterday. It announced that 1994
budgets were based on a 1.5 per cent improvement in revenues and, despite an
improvement in confidence in North America and Europe, any recovery was
'still unstable and uncertain'. Tough controls would continue to ensure
'that the group is well placed when real (as opposed to that in the
financial markets) recovery comes'.
Some analysts were surprised by the subdued tone of the statement. Ms Lorna
Tilbian at Warburgs said the results reflected a recovery: 'You don't grow
revenues and increase operating profits so sharply just by management
efforts. You need an underlying recovery and this is evident in the figures.
I just think they're too frightened to say so.' Analysts' forecasts for 1994
pre-tax profits are now about Pounds 85m-Pounds 90m, with some revising
their forecasts slightly downwards.
The flotation of up to 50 per cent of the market research businesses on
either the US or UK stock markets could yield up to Dollars 200m, said the
group. Market research revenues in 1993 were Dollars 320m and operating
profits were Dollars 29m. The companies are based in the US, UK, Australia
and Japan.
If the minority stake were sold for the expected sum, average net
indebtedness could be reduced to Pounds 200m from the 1993 figure of Pounds
339m, said WPP. At the year end, net debt totalled Pounds 84m, down from
Pounds 240m - a sharper reduction than some had expected. The board said
indebtedness and net interest payments were 'manageable' but it continued
'to explore possible asset disposals and other opportunities to improve the
group's capital structure, although on a less pressurised basis'.
