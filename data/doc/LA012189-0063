MARCOS HEALTH HEARING RECESSED UNTIL FEB. 9 
A dispute over whether Ferdinand E. Marcos is too ill to be arraigned on 
racketeering charges remained unresolved Friday when a hearing on the former 
Philippine president was recessed until next month. 
More testimony by medical experts is expected when the hearing resumes Feb. 9 
before U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan. 
The 71-year-old Marcos suffered a collapsed lung Thursday and was reported in 
guarded but stable condition Friday at St. Francis Medical Center in Honolulu.
