PAUL OLDEN WILL ANNOUNCE UCLA FOOTBALL, BASKETBALL 
Radio station KMPC has hired Cleveland Indians announcer Paul Olden to become 
the new voice of UCLA football and basketball, beginning with the basketball 
season. 
Olden also will serve as the host of the station's weeknight "Sportsline" talk 
show, beginning Monday, Oct. 23. 
Olden is replacing Joel Meyers, who left the station to join NBC-TV as a pro 
football announcer. 
It was announced earlier that Bob Starr, who does the Ram radio broadcasts, 
will also do UCLA football this season. 
Olden has signed a multiyear contract. 
Olden, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended Dorsey High School and Los 
Angeles City College, was hired by the Indians before the current baseball 
season. 
Olden, who attended LACC at the same time as new USC announcer Pete Arbogast, 
may be best known in Los Angeles for a question he asked Dodger Manager Tom 
Lasorda on May 14, 1978. 
The Dodgers had just lost to the Chicago Cubs, 10-7, in a 15-inning game in 
which the Cubs' Dave Kingman had three home runs and eight RBIs. 
Olden, working as a news assistant at KLAC, asked Lasorda: "What was your 
opinion of Kingman's performance?" 
Jim Healy, then at KLAC, used Lasorda's expletive-filled response on his show 
the next day, and has used it many times since.
