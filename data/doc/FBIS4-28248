  [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Thursday North Korea's ability to resolve a dispute about 
its nuclear activities would improve its relations with other 
countries, and consequently with Japan. 
  Kazo Watanabe, director of the Social Democratic Party's [of 
Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] General Affairs Bureau, told reporters 
Hata's comments were made in a meeting with SDPJ officials who 
are scheduled to leave for North Korea on Friday. 
  Japan currently has no diplomatic relations with North 
Korea. 
Negotiations to normalize bilateral ties have been stalled since 
November 1992. 
  The SDPJ, the second largest opposition force, will send a 
three-member delegation headed by Watanabe to North Korea 
through Tuesday as part of efforts to promote ties with the 
(North) Korean Workers Party. 
  Hata did not ask the SDPJ officials to hand a personal 
letter 
or message to North Korean leaders, according to Watanabe. 
  A group of legislators of the primary opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party is also scheduled to visit North Korea later 
next week. 
  Hata expressed hope North Korea will keep channels open with 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) whose inspectors 
have been denied full access to nuclear facilities, Watanabe 
said. 
  In the event of Pyonyang's clearing the suspicions of its 
covert nuclear weapons development, Japan will consider 
extending multinational assistance to North Korea in cooperation 
with other countries, Hata was quoted as saying. 
  Hata also said Tokyo wishes to get along well with Pyongyang 
because Japan and North Korea are two neighboring countries in 
Asia.
