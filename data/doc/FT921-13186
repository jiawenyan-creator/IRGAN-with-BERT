FT  23 JAN 92 / Cambodia peace effort lacks cash
THE head of the UN peace-keeping operation due to be launched in Cambodia
said yesterday it was short of money needed to implement peace accords, and
raising more cash would not be easy, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh.
'It is true we have a shortfall in our budget and getting the funding
approved for Untac (United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia) will
not be easy,'' Mr Yasushi Akashi, a Japanese diplomat, said, on arrival in
Phnom Penh on a fact-finding tour.
Under peace accords signed by rival Cambodian factions on October 23, Untac,
numbering several thousand military and civilian personnel, is to supervise
a ceasefire, the disarmament of four armies, and help administer the country
while arranging free elections envisaged for 1993. So far, only a small
advance UN military and civilian operation is in place.
Mr Akashi said he hoped Untac could be deployed before May, but acknowledged
problems did exist. Since the Cold War ended, the UN had had to undertake
many new operations. 'New peace-keeping operations are launched and the
payments of member states for these leaves something to be desired,' he
added.
He would try to hasten the approval of an initial Dollars 200m (Pounds
111.7m) budget for Untac. 'But I am sure that more will be required later.
This is an enormously complex project, probably unprecedented in the UN's
history.'
Full cost of the operation is expected to be more than Dollars 1bn. Also
facing funding difficulties is the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' plan
to repatriate 370,000 Cambodian refugees from Thailand. Diplomats say big
problems exist in persuading UN member states to commit necessary funds for
Cambodia.
