BEACH DESEGREGATED, S. AFRICA ANNOUNCES 
The segregated beach where mixed-race parliamentary leader Allan Hendrickse 
swam in defiance of apartheid two years ago has been opened to all races, an 
official said Wednesday. 
Provincial governor Gene Louw announced his decision to desegregate the beach 
in Port Elizabeth three days after President Pieter W. Botha named him 
successor to Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis. 
Louw last year overruled a decision by the Port Elizabeth City Council to open 
its beaches to all races. 
Hendrickse triggered a prolonged row with Botha on New Year's Day, 1987, when 
he led a group of "colored" (mixed-race) lawmakers in a defiant swim from 
King's Beach in a protest against apartheid and the segregation of public 
facilities.
