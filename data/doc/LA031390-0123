ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; 
PANEL TO STUDY PLANS FOR REDEVELOPMENT 
The City Council unanimously voted Monday night to send redevelopment plans for 
six parcels to the Planning Commission for review. 
With the vote, the project overcame another hurdle, said May Hui, acting 
director of developmental services. 
The City Council originally established a survey area of six parcels in 
October. The parcels, which total 200 acres, include the Buena Park 
Mall/Handyman site on La Palma Avenue, Orange County Flood Control near Malvern 
Boulevard and Dale Street; the Builder's Square site near Beach Boulevard and 
Malvern Boulevard; the Buena Park Drive-In and strawberry fields near Holder 
Street and Lincoln Avenue; the southeast corner of Valley View Street and 
Orangethorpe Avenue, and the northwest corner of Crescent and Western avenues. 
Although it is not known which sites eventually will be included in the final 
project, the main goal of the plan is to add improvements and intensify 
development at the various sites, Hui said. Some of the items being considered 
include adding room for more shop space at established commercial properties 
such as the Buena Park Mall and the Handyman site, as well as putting in homes 
in residentially zoned areas such as the strawberry fields. 
A final decision is not expected for some time, Hui said. "We don't know what 
is eventually going to happen," she said. 
A series of public hearings is tentatively scheduled for June. The proposal 
then goes to the council for a final decision. LYNDA NATALI
