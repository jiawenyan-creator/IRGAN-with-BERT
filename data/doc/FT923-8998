FT  07 AUG 92 / Observer: Tough choice
If the BBC had to choose which government minister it wanted to vet the MMC
report on Television Broadcasting Services, it would probably not have
picked Neil Hamilton, the 43-year-old corporate affairs minister.
Hamilton, who is keen to beef up the MMC's rather tepid recommendations, has
crossed swords with the Beeb before. Along with Gerald Howarth, who lost his
seat at the last election, Hamilton successfully sued the BBC over a 1984
Panorama programme which falsely accused the two Conservative MPs of
neo-Nazi behaviour. It cost the BBC Pounds 500,000 and could well have been
one of the issues that led to the sacking of Alasdair Milne as BBC director
general.
