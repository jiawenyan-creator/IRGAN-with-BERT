FT  25 NOV 92 / Economists see GDP rising at half Treasury estimate
ECONOMIC GROWTH next year will be too weak to prevent further rises in
unemployment, which will remain very high for the rest of the decade, the
Society of Business Economists says today.
The society's latest forecast says gross domestic product will grow by only
0.5 per cent next year - half the rate forecast by the Treasury in the
Autumn Statement this month.
As unemployment continues to rise next year, lack of confidence because of
job insecurity, along with the high burden of debt and a subdued housing
market, will dampen the recovery.
The society, which represents many leading private-sector financial
analysts, forecasts that inflation will remain low in the short term, but
will start to rise at the end of next year and during 1994.
Of the 116 economists surveyed, only 7 per cent expected GDP to fall next
year, compared with 78 per cent forecasting growth of between 0 per cent and
2 per cent next year; 15 per cent expect growth of more than 2 per cent.
The society also forecasts that:
GDP will fall sharply this year and grow by 0.5 per cent next year and by
2.2 per cent in 1994.
Consumer expenditure will rise by 0.9 per cent next year and 1.5 per cent in
1994 after a decline of 0.2 per cent this year.
Gross fixed investment will fall by 1 per cent next year, the fourth
successive annual fall. The society forecasts it will rise by 5.3 per cent
in 1994.
Manufacturing investment will rise by 0.4 per cent next year and by 11.6 per
cent in 1994. Stocks will fall a further Pounds 700m in 1993 and remain
unchanged in 1994.
Retail price inflation will average 2.2 per cent in 1993 and 5.8 per cent in
1994.
The current-account deficit will narrow marginally over the next two years
to about Pounds 11bn in 1994. Exports will rise by 4.6 per cent next year
and 5 per cent in 1994, a slightly faster growth rate than that of imports.
In the longer term, the society expects unemployment to average 2.75m for
the rest of the decade while GDP will manage only below-trend growth of 1.9
per cent between next year and 1997.
Inflation and average earnings growth will also be subdued, averaging 3.6
per cent and 5.3 per cent respectively over the next 10 years, the society
says.
