Applicant's Representations



1. Applicant is an internally managed, diversified closed-end registered investment company. As of December 31,
1993, applicant had outstanding 3,875,600 shares of common stock. Applicant's common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ
National Market System.


2. Before March 26, 1993, applicant was licensed to operate as a small business investment company (``SBIC'') under
the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, and provided long-term, primarily variable rate, secured
loans to finance the growth, expansion, and modernization of small businesses. Applicant was granted an exemption
from various provisions of the Act and the rules thereunder to permit it to create a holding company structure.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The purpose of the holding company structure was to allow applicant to expand its business beyond that of an SBIC. Although
applicant is no longer an SBIC, it will continue to provide secured loans to finance the growth, expansion, and modernization
of small business entities.
