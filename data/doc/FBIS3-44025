  [Text] After something of a lull, there has been more 
gunfire this afternoon in Lesotho's capital, Maseru. For more 
than a week opposing factions of the army have been clashing 
since a group of soldiers demanded a big pay raise. Some said 
it was a front for a coup against the elected government of 
Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle. It was serious enough for UN 
Special Representative in Mozambique Aldo Ajello to be called in 
for talks with the government and the commanders of the opposing 
army groups, but already there has been more shootings. On the 
line to Maseru, Josephine Hazeley asked Mamelo Maurison of 
(MPHATALATANI) newspaper what was going on. 
  [Begin recording] [Maurison] A little after 5 o'clock [1500 
GMT] our time there were gunshot reports from the area of the 
mountain which is occupied by the faction of the army which is 
alleged to be pro-government, and the day had been relatively 
quiet until then. 
  [Hazeley] How heavy were the shellings from where you are? 
  [Maurison] I was still walking out of the center of town and 
the shelling was very heavy, so heavy that people all around, we 
started sort of quickening up, and one was aware that there was 
general concern and anxiety on the faces of people who were on 
the streets then. 
  [Hazeley] As we speak, is it still going on, the selling? 
Can you tell? 
  [Maurison] As we speak it has not been going on, at least 
for 
the last 45 or 50 minutes it has not been going on. 
  [Hazeley] Who was this attack aimed at? Is there any 
indication? 
  [Maurison] I couldn't tell where it was going to, except 
that 
one could only guess that shots from that end have been aimed at 
the other faction at Makoanyane barracks, so I just guess that 
it may have been directed at Makoanyane. 
  [Hazeley] Did you see or have you heard any reports of 
anybody being injured or property being damaged? 
  [Maurison] No, no, I haven't heard anything about anybody 
being injured or anything about that today. 
  [Hazeley] You said it happened at 5 o'clock local time, or 
around 5 o'clock local time. Has the government said anything 
on their national radio yet? 
  [Maurison] Not that I am aware of as of now. There will be a 
broadcast of the local news, we are expecting to hear something 
from the government radio then. [end recording]
