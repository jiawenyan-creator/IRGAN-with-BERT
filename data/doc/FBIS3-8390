  [Text] Sofia, March 7 (BTA) -- At about 22:00 hrs. on 
March 6, the Bulgarian Embassy in Belgrade contacted the Foreign 
Ministry of Yugoslavia (Serbia-Montenegro) asking the Yugoslav 
authorities to provide assistance in the arrest and 
identification of the hijackers of the Khan Kubrat, in ensuring 
the safety of the crew and the inviolability of the ship and its 
cargo, and in returning them to Bulgaria, BTA learned from the 
Press Centre of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry. The same 
request was made to the Yugoslav Embassy in Sofia. 
  Bulgaria's permanent representation to the United Nations in 
New York was instructed to inform the UN Sanctions Committee 
about the case, the Foreign Ministry's Press Centre informed. 
  Passing Vidin on March 6, the Bulgarian vessel Khan Kubrat 
disobeyed orders to stop for a check and threatened to blow up 
if forced to do so. Two armed men were seen on board the ship 
holding its 7-member crew at gun point. The vessel is carrying 
6,000 tonnes of diesel oil and has already left Bulgaria's 
territorial waters. Detained on January 31 by patrol boats 
operated by the Western European Union on suspicion of trying to 
break the embargo on Serbia-Montenegro, it was waiting the 
Regional Prosecutor's Office to rule if the Khan Kubrat's was a 
case of embargo busting or not in the port of Somovit. On the 
night of March 3 to March 4 the vessel slipped out of port 
leaving all its papers behind. 
  Yesterday the Bulgarian Government stated that after 
intensive discussions a decision had been made not to use force 
to liberate the hostages and stop the ship in order to avoid a 
risk of bloodshed and pollution of the Danube River in case of 
an eventual explosion.
