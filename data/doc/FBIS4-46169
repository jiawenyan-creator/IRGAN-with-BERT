  [Excerpt] Mineralniye Vody, May 27 (ITAR-TASS) -- The four 
gunmen, who hijacked a bus with 26 people in the North Caucasus 
on Thursday, flew off in a helicopter provided by Russian 
authorities on Friday after a night of negotiations, carrying 
away with them three women, two men and the bus driver to an 
unknown destination. A crew of three is piloting the helicopter. 
  "It looks as if it could be Makhachkala," an Interior 
Ministry official said. The helicopter is being accompanied by 
seven military helicopters which keep at a distance from the 
hijackers. [passage omitted]
