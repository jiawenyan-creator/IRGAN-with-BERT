  [Text] With the direct participation of the Ministry of 
Finance, a draft presidential edict has been drawn up on a 
package of measures to prevent the growth of inflation in 
Azerbaijan. As Fikret Yusifov, acting minister of finance of 
the Republic, stated to a correspondent of the KHABAR-SERVIS 
agency, the draft specifically envisages a suspension of the 
construction of secondary and tertiary facilities and long-term 
construction projects, as well as the adoption of special 
parallel measures in connection with the coming increase in the 
minimum wage which, in the words of the acting finance minister, 
will have a negative effect on inflationary processes. 
  F. Yusifov declined to give a direct response to the agency 
correspondent's question as to how accurate are the rumors 
concerning anti-inflationary experiments by the directorship of 
the National Bank of Azerbaijan, that the bank flooded the black 
market with a large amount of foreign currency to stabilize the 
exchange rate of the manat. Yusifov noted that such rumors were 
being spread prior to his time as well, but they have not been 
corroborated. He added that the National Bank does not possess 
a large quantity of foreign currency, and that what currency 
exists is concentrated mainly in the International Bank.
