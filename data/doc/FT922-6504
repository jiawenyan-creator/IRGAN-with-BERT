FT  23 MAY 92 / International Company News: Earnings at Mazda tumble 60%
THE DOWNTURN in the Japanese car market last year led to a 60 per cent fall
in pre-tax profit at Mazda to Y19.7bn (Dollars 151m). The car maker was also
bruised by increased depreciation charges on new production facilities.
Mazda had hoped that the introduction of new medium-sized and luxury models
last year would itself have stimulated demand within Japan, but its sales in
the domestic market fell from 599,650 units to 549,627 units and total sales
value rose by only 3.5 per cent to Y2,304bn.
The company is forecasting an even tougher year ahead, with pre-tax profit
down to Y15bn and sales slightly higher at Y2,430bn. However, the continuing
weakness in the domestic market may force downward revisions in coming
months.
Like most other Japanese makers, Mazda had presumed in the late 1980s that
the remarkable growth in car sales which accompanied the expansion of the
'financial bubble' would continue indefinitely, and the company was prompted
to add extra production capacity.
But new car registrations in Japan started falling in the last quarter of
1990 and the decline last calendar year was 6.5 per cent. While some makers
were able to expand their sales revenue by increasing exports, Mazda's
exports increased by only 3,795 units to 859,638 units.
One consequence of the difficult conditions was a Y72.4bn fall in Mazda's
cash deposits to Y108.9bn, and a Y10.7bn increase to Y83.7bn in finished
products on hand.
