  [Text] [Excerpts] The single-minded pursuit of rapid 
economic growth has led to severe environmental problems in many 
Asian cities, a United Nations report said yesterday. 
  [passage omitted] ``Ambient air pollution statistics point 
to 
the special risks of living in a large Asian city,'' the 
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) 
study said. 
  [passage omitted] The study found Bangkok hurting in several 
areas. ``Bangkok dust levels in 1989 were estimated to have 
cost 26 million lost work days and 1,400 excess deaths,'' it 
says. 
  ``Also in Bangkok, average lead blood levels are 40 to 45 
micrograms per deciliter, four times the standard in the United 
States,'' it says. ``There is evidence of permanent brain damage 
in children because of lead poisoning.'' 
  Parts of the Chao Phaya River flowing through Bangkok ``are 
completely lacking in dissolved oxygen and can no longer support 
life'' because untreated household and industrial waste is 
dumped into the river, it says.
