FT  06 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK banks
UK bank shares have risen by over 50 per cent since sterling left the ERM
last September. Until the current results season, the rise seemed justified
on the basis that lower interest rates would gradually float the sector free
of bad debt provisions. The optimism now seems overdone. Though Barclays was
the worst performer, there was a general trend for bad debts to rise between
the first and second halves of 1992. They may be stubbornly slow to fall in
1993. There will be less topping up of old property provisions, but economic
recovery tends to stretch small businesses and provisions on European
lending look set to rise.
Nor is the outlook for operating profits encouraging. Though 1992 produced
increases of 20 per cent and 18 per cent at National Westminster and
Barclays respectively, Lloyds and Midland, which are further down the
cost-cutting road, saw hardly any increase at all. Loan demand is flat and
there is limited scope for repeating the money market profits generated from
the steep fall in interest rates last autumn.
Those who fear more nasty surprises on provisions might be attracted by a
defensive stock like Lloyds. It can virtually guarantee real dividend
increases, but may not manage sufficient growth in operating income to
justify its present price. Arguably Barclays is on the least demanding
rating in terms of operating profits. Yet those who buy today may have to
wait till 1995 or 1996 before provisions return to more normal levels.
