FT  22 DEC 94 / Mandela policies endorsed by ANC
The national conference of South Africa's ruling African National Congress
put its seal of approval on the government's performance by adopting the
generally moderate platforms drawn up by a series of internal commissions.
But delegates signalled a warning for the future by overwhelmingly electing
some of the party's most radical figures to the party's national executive
committee.
On the closing day of the five-day meeting, most of the resolutions up for
approval passed with little dissent, but in the voting for the 60 directly
elected members to the ANC's ruling body, the top vote-getter was Mr Bantu
Holomisa, former military leader of the Transkei homeland currently deputy
minister of tourism.
Mr Peter Mokaba, former leader of the ANC Youth League, came third, and the
controversial Ms Winnie Mandela, the deputy minister of arts and sciences
and President Nelson Mandela's estranged wife, came fifth.
Along with other prominent ANC members such as Harry Gwala from
KwaZulu-Natal and Tony Yengeni from the Western Cape, both also elected to
the NEC, these three are generally regarded as the most uncontrollable
elements within the party. Despite their grassroots popularity, they were
denied senior cabinet posts following the movement's election victory in
April because of their loose-cannon reputation.
All sitting cabinet members were also elected to the executive body.
The positive response to Mr Mandela's closing address, in which he praised
the degree of consensus achieved at the conference while promising to guard
against corruption in the party and government, reinforced the generally
moderate tone of the triennial conference as it concluded business
yesterday.
