II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange is proposing to waive the following monthly fees that are applicable to its Equity and Option Floor Members:
(1) Equity Floor Broker Booth Fees of $125, $250, and $375 for small, large, and area booths, respectively; (2) Equity
Floor Privilege Fees of $165 per registered floor member and registered clerk; (3) approximately 50% of the Systems
Fee of $1,700 per post on the Equity Floor; (4) approximately 61% of the Options Floor Booth Fees of $275, $350, and $450
for retail booths, clearing booths, and stock execution booths, respectively, and approximately 61% of the $300
surcharge for prime location booths; (5) approximately 61% of the Options Market Maker Fees of $660 per month; and
(6) a waiver of 100% of the $0.02 per contract options independent broker fee up to a maximum of $100 per broker per month.
The Exchange proposes that the waiver be in effect for three months.

The purpose of the proposed waivers is to provide the Exchange's Floor Members, who have borne the most significant
burden of fee increases in recent years, with a discount in floor fees in response to increased revenues. The discount
will apply to three months of 1994.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and Section
6(b)(4), in particular, in that it provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable charges among its members.
