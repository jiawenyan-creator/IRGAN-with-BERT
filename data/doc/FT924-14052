FT  12 OCT 92 / BMW-Renault recycling pact
BMW, the luxury car maker, has sealed the first international co-operation
agreement for recycling used cars with France's Renault, it said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Munich. BMW had signed the contract to work together on
disassembling procedures and industrial recycling of the used cars, it
added.
The two groups also agreed that Francaise des Ferrailles in Athis-mons would
process used BMW cars in France, while Guenter Schmitt in Wurzburg would
recycle used cars of both companies in Germany. Germany's environment
minister Klaus Topfer presented a draft regulation in August which would
make it compulsory for car makers to take back their old cars when the cars
are ready for the scrap heap.
