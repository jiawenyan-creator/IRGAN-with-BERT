FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Eurocopter to cut 1,000 jobs
EUROCOPTER, the West's second-largest helicopter manufacturer after
Sikorsky, is to cut 1,000 jobs - about 10 per cent of its workforce - at its
plants in France and Germany.
The venture, set up last year by French Aerospatiale and Daimler-Benz's
Deutsche Aerospace, blamed military cutbacks and a cautious civilian market.
It reported post-tax profits of FFr25m (Dollars 4.6m).
