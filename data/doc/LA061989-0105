THE SIDELINES; 
BRAVES, DRAFTEE IN HIGH-FIGURES PACT 
The Atlanta Braves have reached an agreement with first-round draft choice 
Tyler Houston of Las Vegas that reportedly will make him the highest-paid 
draftee in the National League club's history. 
Terms were not revealed, but The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported today 
that Houston will get more than the $230,000 bonus received by pitcher Andy 
Benes of the San Diego organization last year. The Atlanta record is a $211,000 
bonus to left-handed pitcher Steve Avery, the third pick in last year's draft. 
The younger Houston batted .485 with 13 home runs and 66 RBI in his senior year 
at Valley High School in Las Vegas. He is primarily a catcher, but has played 
at third base and shortstop.
