  [Text] Another consignment of food and medicine arrived in 
Kigali airport today as part of a humanitarian program keeping 
emergency supplies flowing to the beleaguered Rwandan capital, 
but the battle for Kigali continues and the two sides have not 
yet met for face-to-face negotiations. Shuttling between 
opposing camps has been the UN commander in Kigali, General 
Romeo Dallaire who desperately tries to find common ground 
between the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] and Rwandan Government 
forces. On the line to Kigali this afternoon, Herbert Sallah 
asked General Dallaire whether he has been making any progress. 
  [Begin recording] [Dallaire] The RPF indicated unless the 
preconditions are met they will not be attending any other 
meeting and we have just finished spending the afternoon with 
the RGF [Rwandan Government Forces] going over the responses to 
the preconditions. 
  [Sallah] And what are there responses to the conditions of 
the RPF?. 
  [Dallaire] Well again, if you don't mind, we have just come 
back from our meeting with them. We certainly want to review 
the notes of the meeting and then discuss them with the RPF and 
when that is done, then I think we would be in a position to go 
public. 
  [Sallah] In the meantime, is there a lot of fighting in the 
capital today? 
  [Dallaire] Not very much fighting though. There has been 
exchanges but we have had some rockets fired this afternoon 
aimed at a radio station that has been producing some very 
inflammatory propaganda misinformation. It has been doing that 
for some time and so our estimate is that the RPF targeted it 
but we just don't have the confirmation of the sites where 
possibly those rockets were fired from. 
  [Sallah] At the moment who has the upper hand in the 
fighting? 
  [Dallaire] I don't think it would be readily evident who has 
the upper hand. I think that the RPF do have some offensive 
power and they are exercising it with certain reserve as they 
are very far from the lines, of course. So I would suspect that 
they are husbanding their resources for possibly another push or 
something. 
  [Sallah] Would you estimate that they have got the necessary 
military strength to take Kigali as they have been threatening 
to do? 
  [Dallaire] They will need a lot of capability to do that and 
also their capability is going to have to also consider the fact 
the local militias or self-defense groups are becoming bolder, 
and so that is a factor that may also affect their operation. 
  [Sallah] Finally, Gen. Dallaire, can you tell us about any 
fighting in the rest of the country? 
  [Dallaire] Apart from the last tidbit of information that we 
did get from the north in (Jumba) area, with that pocket 
apparently surrounded and action going on, the rest of the line 
is essentially quite quiet and people are simply sending off 
patrols. [end recording] 
  While the UN struggles to find common ground between the 
combatants, the fighting for control of Kigali continues. Our 
correspondent Mark Dowle has been down to RPF headquarters in 
central Kigali today where amid the gunfire he talked to rebel 
spokesman Seth Sendor Shanga. 
  [Begin recording] [Shanga] There has been outgoing shot 
heard 
but at the moment what you can hear is heavy machine guns, 
antiaircraft guns firing at enemy positions. 
  [Dowle] How long do you think it would take you to take 
Kigali if indeed you do take it? 
  [Shanga] I think it can't take long now that we have 
positions around (Kigalo). As you are aware we have taken 
Rebero. We are concentrating around (Montari). We are all 
around the city. It won't take long before we take the city. 
  [Dowle] How many days? 
  [Shanga] It is a matter of a few days. 
  [Dowle) But why haven't you taken the main Army camp, the 
main Gendarmerie camp, and the camp by the airport. Why haven't 
you taken those if you think you are willing?. 
  [Shanga] No, we have not taken those because our aim is not 
to take the military camps. And again as we say we are always 
fighting people who come out of the population, and when they 
attack us we also attack them. Our aim is not to take the 
military camps as such because we still believe that there are 
many, many Rwandan soldiers who are genuine and they are looking 
for peace, and we have no need of attacking them. So we attack 
those who attack us. [end recording]
