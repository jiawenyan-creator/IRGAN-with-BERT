(10) REA intends that the optical fibers contained in the cables manufactured in accordance with this section have
characteristics that will allow signals, having a range of wavelengths, to be carried simultaneously. 
(b) 

Optical fibers.

 (1) The solid glass optical fibers must consist of a cylindrical core and cladding covered by either an ultraviolet-cured
acrylate or other suitable coating. 
(2) The optical fiber types must be one of the following: 
(i) Dispersion-unshifted single mode fiber EIA Class IVa; 
(ii) Dispersion-shifted single mode fiber EIA Class IVb; 
(iii) 50/125 micrometer multimode fiber EIA Class Ia; or 
(iv) 62.5/125 micrometer multimode fiber EIA Class Ia. 
(3) The dispersion-unshifted single mode fiber core must have either a matched or depressed clad step refractive
index profile with a mode-field diameter of 9.0

refractive index profile with a mode-field diameter of 7.5+1.5 micrometers/^1.3 micrometers when measured at 1550
nanometers in accordance with any one of the test procedures specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. 
(5) The core clad off-set of the dispersion-unshifted and dispersion-shifted single mode fibers must not be greater
than 1.0 micrometer when measured in accordance with either EIA/TIA45545B or EIA/TIA455176.
