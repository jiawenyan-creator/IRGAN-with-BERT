Gabon Fears for Economy: OPEC member Gabon said its whole economy was in danger 
after anti-government riots led foreign oil companies to evacuate their staff. 
Information Minister Jean-Remy Pendy-Bouyiki said Gabon was losing $50 million 
a day in export revenue. "If oil production is interrupted for more than 10 
days, the whole economy will be on its knees," he said. He gave no details on 
how oil exports were affected. The government said oil companies, including 
France's Elf-Aquitaine and Royal Dutch Shell, have cut production to a trickle 
and evacuated most staff from the former French colony.
