 

VI. Conclusion





The Commission believes that the NYSE's, Amex's, and NASD's proposals to adopt the Policy as set forth above is an important
step toward increasing shareholder protection, thereby enhancing investor confidence in the U.S. securities markets.
The Commission continues to encourage the adoption of such standards by the remaining SROs, and remains confident
that such a voting rights listing standard is a beneficial step toward strengthing the U.S. securities markets.




The Commission also finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with Sections 6(b)(8) and 15A(b)(9)
<FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>
 of the Act, which provide that an SRO's rules must not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Commission recognizes that, under the Policy, issuers with capital
structures that do not conform to the requirements of the Policy will not be permitted to list or include their securities
on three major U.S. markets. Nevertheless, the Commission is persuaded by the SROs' stated objectives_to enhance
investor protections
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
; and to provide investors with the protections the Policy affords and the benefit of knowing that issuers cannot avoid
the effects of a market's voting rights policy by seeking an interpretation in another market
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
_that the Policy and procedures for interpretations under the Policy do not place an undue burden on competition and
that any burden on competition that may result from the Policy is appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the
Act.

Similarly, as discussed in this order, the Commission believes the proposed rule changes do not violate Sections
6(b)(5) and 15A(b)(6) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 which provide, among other things, that the rules of an SRO may not be designed to permit unfair discrimination between
issuers, among others.

</FOOTNOTE>


For the reasons stated above, as well as the analysis contained in this order, the Commission believes that the protections
afforded shareholders by the adoption of SRO proposals that will prohibit certain disparate voting rights plans
that disenfranchise existing shareholders is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder pertaining to a national securities association and to national securities exchanges.



It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule changes (SRNYSE9420, SRAmex9429, and SRNASD9495)
are approved.
