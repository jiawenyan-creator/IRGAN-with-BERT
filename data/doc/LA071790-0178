NAMES IN THE NEWS; 
ARNIE'S ARMY ON ITS FINAL MARCH 
An era will end at St. Andrews this week when Arnold Palmer walks down the 18th 
fairway for the last time after 30 years as a living legend of the British 
Open. 
Palmer, approaching his 61st birthday, confirmed today that this was to be his 
final Open, appropriately at the same course where he played in the most 
venerable of the golf championships for the first time in 1960. 
In all, Palmer has played 21 Opens, winning in 1961 and 1962. 
Recognized as the man who resurrected the championship to its current exalted 
status by persuading his fellow American players to follow him across the 
Atlantic, he believes the time has come to fade into the background. 
"I think it's appropriate I don't play any more, particularly if I keep 
shooting the kind of scores I've been shooting recently," he said. 
"Concentration is the major thing I lack today. I can remember when I played 
and it didn't really matter if I was swinging good or bad. It was all about 
what my mind was telling me at the time.
