IF THINGS ARE BAD, HOW SWEET CAN IT BE FOR BUSH? 
George Bush is going to be a one-term President. 
People will vote their pocketbooks in 1992, as they have in about 48 of the 50 
presidential elections we've had so far. 
If things are looking up, the ones who make the difference will stick with what 
they've got, which has been the Republicans for more than 10 years now. If 
things are bad, they'll change -- and put in a Democrat. 
It looks as if things will be bad. The savings and loans are gone with a lot of 
our money. Real estate prices are collapsing, trapping sellers in their homes 
or forcing them to default. The cycle of mortgage foreclosures and no buyers 
will soon enough lead to bank failures around the country. 
A political analyst named Bush said in 1988 -- this was one of the true things 
he said -- that for the Democrats to do well, America has to do badly. That 
appears to be happening now in 1990. 
Well, bad luck for Bush. He has been an extraordinarily lucky candidate and 
President up to now. But in 1992, a lot of voters will abandon him. That is not 
because they like Democrats, or any particular Democrat, all that well. Nor do 
they particularly like politics or government, either. 
But it is becoming obvious to almost everybody that this bunch of Republicans 
did not really want to stop what government does; they just wanted to control 
what it did or did not do. They did that and failed miserably at a lot of it.
