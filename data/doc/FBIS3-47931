  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
Thursday [20 January] welcomed a U.S. decision to drop 
threatened trade sanctions concerning a bilateral dispute over 
Japan's construction market. 
  Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi said in a statement that 
the U.S. appears to have given high marks to efforts by the 
administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to resolve 
the issue, including a recent action program to open Japan's 
construction market to foreign contractors. 
  Following Tuesday's unveiling of the action program to 
overhaul Japan's public works bidding system, the United States 
announced Wednesday it had removed trade sanctions set to go 
into effect Thursday. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata also lauded Washington's move, 
saying in a statement that he is convinced that the settlement 
of the issue will contribute to progress in ongoing bilateral 
framework trade talks.
