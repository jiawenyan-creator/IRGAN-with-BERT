  [Text] The United States, Russia, and Europe adopted a 
common stance in Geneva yesterday to bring peace to Bosnia. In 
Geneva yesterday, the foreign ministers of these countries gave 
the belligerents two weeks to resume peace negotiations. They 
urged them to conclude an agreement on the basis of the 
territorial compromise reached earlier, which gave 51 percent of 
Bosnian territory to the Muslims and the Croats and 49 percent 
to the Serbs. Can we expect any results from yesterday's 
meeting? Was there any progress in the search for a solution to 
the problem? Without hesitation, French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe told Christophe Blondeau that the answer is yes. 
  [Begin Juppe recording] This is the first time that Russian, 
U.S., and European foreign ministers have met, not to issue 
vague statements, but to agree on certain precise points. 
Second, there is the content of the declaration. We called on 
the parties to cease hostilities completely, as soon as 
possible. This means the withdrawal of heavy weapons and the 
deployment of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] buffer forces. 
Then we drew up the outlines of a political agreement: the 
preservation of the unity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, institutional 
arrangements between the different communities, so each can 
administer itself freely, and territorial compromise, with 51 
percent for the Croat-Muslim federation and 49 percent for the 
Serbian entity. Finally, in the event of this being accepted 
and signed -- and not only signed, but implemented -- that is, 
if the the Serbs withdrew from the parts of the Bosnian 
territory they should evacuate, then we could envisage the start 
of a progressive suspension of sanctions. We now have to obtain 
the agreement of the parties. This will be the task of the 
contact group, which will start its work as from tomorrow. [end
