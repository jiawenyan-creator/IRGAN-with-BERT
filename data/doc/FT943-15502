FT  08 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee tumbles on Brazil sales
plan - Market Report
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures tumbled in the afternoon on news
that Brazil was ready to sell 5m bags (60kg each) on the internal market to
calm prices. The September position ended Dollars 50 down at Dollars 3,095 a
tonne after earlier plunging Dollars 100.
At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices were supported by commission
house buying, and though they closed sharply lower on the day the overall
uptrend remained intact, dealers said. ALUMINIUM initially buckled when
copper came under pressure, but rallied after finding support below Dollars
1,500 a tonne.
