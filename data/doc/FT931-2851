FT  18 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Mauling for drug shares
A BEARISH story on the drug stocks in the US press, together with profits
warnings from two leading US groups, brought renewed pressure on a
thoroughly depressed pharmaceuticals sector.
Marion Merrell Dow shocked Wall Street by announcing that its first-quarter
numbers would be substantially lower than those of the same period last
year, while Eli Lilley plunged more than 5 per cent after a similar warning.
A story in the Washington Post, warning of a possible freeze on drug prices,
set the seal on what was always going to be a difficult day for one of the
UK market's biggest sectors and an area that has endured unpleasant shocks
in recent weeks.
Glaxo, badly mauled by the market after criticisms from the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) recently over claims for its Zantic anti-ulcer drug,
and still reeling from the resignation of Mr Ernest Mario, its former chief
executive and deputy chairman, dropped 14 to 633p on a large turnover of
5.8m shares.
SmithKline Beecham shares, heavily sold in London after the FDA rejected
approval of its much-vaunted anti-nausea drug Kytril, ran back 15 1/2 to 447
1/2 p with 2m shares changing hands. Wellcome finished 23 down at 902p and
ICI 14 cheaper at 1208p.
