  [Text] Who, among the following politicians, would you like 
to be prime minister? Silvio Berlusconi (43.5 percent), 
Gianfranco Fini (27.7), Roberto Maroni (9.1), Umberto Bossi (8.9 
percent), and Francesco Cossiga (5.3). 
  Thus, those who voted for the Right want Berlusconi in 
Palazzo Chigi [government's seat]. This is the result of an SWG 
[Integrated Research Services]-FAMIGLIA CRISTIANA opinion poll 
which was conducted shortly after the election results were 
known. The sample was composed of voters from the pole for 
freedom and the pole for good government in proportion to the 
votes received by each individual party making up the alliances. 
The sample was made up of 392 Forza Italia voters, 248 National 
Alliance voters, and 160 Northern League voters. Berlusconi 
also obtained approval from League (38 percent) and National 
Alliance (40 percent) voters. The League voters put Bossi only 
in third place, after the League's number-two man Maroni. In 
the 18- to 24-year-old bracket, Fini was the most successful (37 
percent against Bossi's 34). Fini also prevailed among 
right-wing voters from central Italy.
