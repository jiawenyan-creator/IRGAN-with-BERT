FT  17 NOV 92 / Bond pleads not guilty oncharge of dishonesty
MR ALAN BOND, the bankrupt Australian entrepreneur, yesterday pleaded not
guilty for the second time to a charge of dishonestly inducing a businessman
to take part in a ADollars 370m (Pounds 168m) corporate rescue.
Mr Bond, 54, was jailed for two-and-a-half years after being convicted on a
similar charge in May, but was released in August after the Western
Australian Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the conviction.
The appeal court ordered a second trial after hearing fresh evidence which
the defence claimed threw doubt on the credibility of prosecution witnesses.
The retrial, in the Perth district court, is expected to conclude later this
week.
The charge against Mr Bond is related to the 1987 rescue of Rothwells
merchant bank, run by Mr Laurie Connell, a fellow entrepreneur. Mr Bond,
then chairman of Bond Corporation, played a leading part in organising the
rescue.
The prosecution claims that Mr Bond concealed from Mr Brian Coppin, a
businessman who contributed to the rescue, the fact that Bond Corporation
was to receive a ADollars 16m success fee from Rothwells.
Mr Coppin told the court that Mr Bond asked him in October 1987 to raise
ADollars 20m (later reduced to ADollars 8m) to assist the rescue of
Rothwells. He said he did not learn of the success fee until November 14.
The Rothwells rescue followed the worldwide stock market collapse in October
1987.
The bank, which collapsed in November 1988, was the focus of a recent royal
commission report into relationships between politicians and businessmen in
Western Australia. More than 20 people face criminal charges relating to the
rescue, including Mr Connell.
Mr Bond quit as chairman of Bond Corp in September 1990, just two days
before the company announced a record loss of ADollars 2.2bn.
