  [Text] Australia's Foreign Minister, Gareth Evans, has 
urged the UN Security Council to leave the way open for North 
Korea to change its mind over international inspections of its 
nuclear facilities. While reaffirming Australia's willingness 
to abide by any decision the Security Council might take on 
sanctions, Senator Evans said in Manila that the situation would 
have to be handled delicately. Trevor Watson reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Watson] Senator Evans said he would 
deplore any decision that drove the North Koreans beyond the 
point of no return in their dealings with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency or the world community. Nobody, he says, 
knows if sanctions will do that or encourage the North to be 
more open in the future. 
  [Evans] Will it serve the purpose for keeping them committed 
in the future and to ensure that we at least know there won't be 
diversion of nuclear material in the future, or will it be the 
trigger which in fact pushes them over the brink to walk away 
from the Nonproliferation Treaty altogether? [end recording]
