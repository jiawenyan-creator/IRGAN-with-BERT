  [Text] The Japan Gas Association, Inc., has released the 
interim report of the ``survey and research group on desert 
greening technology as a CO[.sup]2[/] countermeasure'' 
(chaired by Tokyo University Professor Yoichi Kaya), which was 
formed in September 1992. The report states: 
  (1) The global amount of CO[.sup]2[/] released during use 
of fossil fuels is estimated to be 6 billion tons per year, and 
to be effective, a minimum of 100 million tons per year must be 
fixed, which requires 100 square kilometers (sqm) of 
afforestation; 
  (2) to be effective, CO[.sup]2[/] fixing must be 
continuous over a long period (100 years) by trees that have 
been planted, and R&amp;D on the lifestyle, industries and social 
systems of the implementing regions are needed along with 
research on afforestation and greening technologies. 
  Until now, research on desert greening was mainly elemental 
research, such as on agricultural technology and grassland for 
pastures, but the unique feature of research by Japan Gas 
Association's research group is the regarding of desert greening 
as a CO[.sup]2[/] countermeasure and the approach of 
integrating all the sectors. 
  As a result of research thus far, the following four 
proposals have been made: 
  (1) Over 100 sqm afforestation is needed; 
  (2) CO[.sup]2[/] fixing must continue for 100 years; 
  (3) long-term evaluation of a macro-balance is needed that 
takes into account not only the amount of CO[.sup]2[/] fixed 
in forests but also the CO[.sup]2[/] generated by sustained 
afforestation; 
  (4) the many diverse types of deserts should be ranked by 
the 
needed afforestation technologies, and the best technologies 
should be applied. 
  In the future, climate improvement technologies, 
technologies 
for effective use of water, and rainy season-based afforestation 
technologies will be studied with emphasis on effective 
supplying and use of water resources in the desert. In addition, 
quantitative evaluation of the amount of CO[.sup]2[/] fixed 
will be carried out and scenarios for desert greening projects 
will be drawn up as a compilation of research. 
  The Japan Gas Association established this research group 
jointly with the Research Institute of Innovative Technologies 
for the Earth (RITE), and has provided &yen;5 million per year 
in funding.
