  [Text] Kampala, 11 Jan (AFP) -- Ugandan Lord's Army rebels 
have agreed to surrender on condition that the government gives 
them money to help them start new lives and guarantees them 
security, officials said Tuesday. The rebel movement, formerly 
known as the Holy Spirit Movement and led by priestess Alice 
Lakwena, expressed their intention to come out of the bush when 
they met a government delegation headed by former president Tito 
Okello. 
  The meeting took place in Agik forest near the northwestern 
town of Gulu on Monday. Rebel leader Joseph Kony, who claims to 
be guided by the holy spirit, attended the talks for the first 
time. The Lord's Army, who fought to overthrow the government of 
President Yoweri Museveni, are blamed for killing hundreds of 
civilians in northern Uganda during the past six years.
