  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said today that the 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles [DOP] with the 
Palestinians depends on the attainment of an agreement in Taba. 
Rabin reiterated that there are no sacred dates, and that the 
basis for the target dates is the attainment of an agreement. 
Our correspondent Yiftah El'azar reports: 
  [Begin recording] [El'azar] One would be well advised not 
to expect a breakthrough in the Taba talks in the next few days, 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin stated today. Warning against 
disappointment, Rabin said that if there is no basis for the 
continuation of the dialogue with the Palestinians the sides 
might reach the conclusion that there is nothing to talk about. 
The prime minister was asked whether Israel would comply with 
the target date set for the completion of the withdrawal from 
Gaza and Jericho, and he replied that the target date depends on 
an agreement being signed in Taba. 
  [Rabin] I reiterate: There are no sacred dates. The DOP 
mentions phases and target dates, but the basis for these target 
dates is the ability to attain an agreement. [Later on in the 
program, Rabin is quoted as saying that he would rather "not 
renew the peace talks with the PLO in Washington, as long as the 
Israelis and the Palestinians do not reach an agreement in 
Taba."] 
  [El'azar] Rabin also referred to the security situation, in 
the wake of suspicions that the murder of a taxi driver in 
Herzliyya yesterday was committed for nationalistic motives. 
There are no signs of a rise in the number of terrorist 
attacks, the prime minister said, and the closure has so far 
proved itself. At the same time, he noted, we cannot defend 
ourselves from individuals who cross the Green Line to carry out 
terrorist attacks. 
  [Rabin] We have signs that some of the elements opposed to 
the agreement who pursue terror do not suffice with attacks on 
Israelis in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza but definitely want to 
penetrate Israel's sovereign territory. 
  [El'azar] One must bear in mind that the closure is not 
hermetical, Rabin said, vowing that the security forces would do 
their utmost to tighten security. [end recording]
