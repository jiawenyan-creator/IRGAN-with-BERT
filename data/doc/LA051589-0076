MORNING REPORT: EXIT LINES 
Crime may not pay but "Vice" does. Edward James Olmos visited 52 His-panic 
inmates in Chicago's Cook County Jail last week to stress the economic 
ad-vantages of clean living. "When I started, I couldn't sing, I couldn't dance 
and I couldn't act," he said. "Now I make $3.5 million a year on 'Miami Vice."' 
To underscore his point home, Olmos told the inmates how he bought a $140,000 
Porsche for $45,000 at a police auction of property confiscated from drug 
dealers. "The guy got 30 years," he said. "I got his car." CLAUDIA PUIG and
