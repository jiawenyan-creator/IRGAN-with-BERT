CS LONG BEACH BEATS FRESNO STATE 
It took a long time, but Cal State Long Beach finally reached .500 Saturday 
night by defeating Fresno State, 59-51, before a sellout crowd of 1,908 at Long 
Beach. 
"We've had to overcome a lot of injuries, before the season and now . . . it's 
been a grind," Coach Joe Harrington said after the 49ers improved to 11-11 
overall -- the first time they have been at .500 this season -- and 8-5 in the 
Big West Conference. It was also their third consecutive victory. 
The 49ers won the game at the free-throw line. They made only two field goals 
in the last 11 minutes but made 16 of 22 from the line during that time. 
"Getting to the one-and-one with 11 minutes to go made a big difference for 
us," Harrington said. 
The 49ers, who have been practicing free-throw shooting, made 73% from the line 
in the second half. 
"We've been coming in at night and a couple of mornings at 6:30, so we've been 
shooting a lot more free throws," Harrington said. 
Guard Tyrone Mitchell, who led the 49ers with 12 points, made seven of the free 
throws that kept Fresno State (11-10 and 6-6) at a safe distance. 
Long Beach, which lost, 56-55, at Fresno earlier in the season, improved from a 
26-20 halftime lead to a 45-34 lead with 8:59 left. 
But Jervis Cole, who led Fresno with 15 points, made a three-point play to 
start a 7-0 spurt that got the Bulldogs to within 45-41 at 5:33. 
But in the next three minutes the 49ers scored five free throws -- two by Marco 
Fleming and three by Mitchell -- and got a rebound basket from Rudy Harvey to 
make it 52-41. Fresno never got closer than nine points the rest of the way. 
The 49ers' press forced 16 Fresno turnovers, and Long Beach outrebounded the 
taller Bulldogs, 31-29. 
All of the 49ers' top nine players scored. John Hatten had 10 points, Harvey 
had nine and Fleming scored eight.
