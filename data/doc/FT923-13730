FT  11 JUL 92 / Motoring: Joy in a convertible
HONDA'S latest CRX is quite unlike the energetic little buzz-box of a
Civic-derived coupe it replaces. A two-seat convertible, it has a hard top
that lifts off in one piece and slots into the boot lid.
There are two versions, both powered by 1.6 litre VTEC engines from the
Civic. The 125 horsepower CRX ESi, with 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic,
has the acceleration of a 2-litre car, rides comfortably and handles with
precision. Topless in the sun on the switchback roads of the Border country
of Scotland, its nimbleness made it pure joy to drive.
With the power-operated rear window retracted, wind noise and buffetting
were minimal. The boot is big; roomy enough for the CRX to be used as a
holiday touring car, not just as a stylish runabout.
The CRX VTi (pictured), with 160 horsepower - a hard-to- believe output from
a naturally aspirated 1.6 litre - felt even more vigorous than the ESi. But
it would not be my choice. Lower geared for fiercer acceleration it was
fussier, harder riding and less refined.
Prices are attractive; Pounds 14,950 for the ESi, Pounds 16,450 for the VTi.
Honda says that as the CRX comes off the same assembly line as the Civic, it
can be built to the highest standards at a lower cost than low volume
sporting two-seaters.
The hood is easily lifted off but Honda plans to offer a powered version
later this year. At the touch of a button twin arms rise from the boot, lift
off the roof, stow it under the boot lid and then sink back out of sight.
James Bond would have approved.
