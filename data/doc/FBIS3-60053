  [Text] Announcer: In Sardinia there is a red 
alert as far as drugs are concerned, particularly in Cagliari, 
where a deadly form of Thai heroin is circulating. Tonino Opes 
reports. 
  Opes: Four victims in two days: Drugs are 
exacting a heavy toll in Sardinia. There are lethal overdoses 
from the killer heroin that has recently begun to arrive from 
Thailand after an absence of ten years. Now it has replaced 
Brown Sugar [previous two words in English] and its effects are 
more devastating. The Cagliari police commissioner, Emilio 
Pazzi, has sounded the alarm. 
  Pazzi: To inject oneself with a dose of Thai 
heroin for those who are used to Brown Sugar, using most 
probably the same dose, means facing almost certain death. 
  Opes: Thai heroin is exceptionally pure and is 
difficult to cut into doses, so drug addicts are running a high 
risk. In Cagliari alone there are over 10,000 drug addicts, but 
the problem concerns the whole island. Unfortunately Sardinia 
has one of the highest rates of AIDS in Italy. 
  Announcer: We have just received the news that the 
killer-heroin has claimed another victim this morning in Sassari 
[Sardinia]. A young man of 32 died after having injected 
himself with a dose of the lethal heroin.
