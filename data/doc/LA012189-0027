THOMPSON'S WALKOUT DOES NOT GENERATE A GREAT DEAL OF SUPPORT 
John Thompson should do us a favor. The next time he walks off the court in 
protest of an NCAA rule, he should keep walking and never come back. 
Thompson feels as though students from lower socioeconomic areas are being 
discriminated against. I agree! Those individuals have been cheated out of a 
quality education. But how about that student-athlete who excels academically 
but loses the basketball scholarship to someone who does not even belong in 
college. 
Now that's what I call discrimination.
