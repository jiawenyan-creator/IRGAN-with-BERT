FT  08 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: BT's Asian connection
BT's shares are back in favour. The 4 per cent rise over the past two days,
building on a modest rally since May, has gone some way to reverse the
terrible performance over the previous half year. The company has regained
its position as the UK's most highly capitalised group.
Yesterday's accord with Nippon Information and Communication has little to
do with the rally. This is not the big Asian deal Sir Iain Vallance, BT's
chairman, has been working for years to pull off. NI&amp;C is a small relatively
unknown company and, anyway, the marketing accord is non-exclusive. The deal
may, of course, foreshadow a closer relationship with Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, NI&amp;C's half-owner. A far-reaching alliance with the Japanese
giant would help fulfil BT's international dreams. But such a deal has yet
to be clinched. Even if it is, investors will be sceptical about BT's
international strategy so long as it depends heavily on paying 'control'
premiums for non-controlling stakes in foreign operators.
Still, the bounce in the share price looks right. BT had been oversold. Back
in May, its yield was 50 per cent higher than the market's. That was only
justified on the assumption that BT faced tough competition and no growth.
Competition it certainly faces. But the UK telecoms market has potential to
grow. BT's attempts to persuade people to use their phones more produced its
first fruit in the quarter to end-March. Not surprisingly, the yield premium
has shrunk to 30 per cent. A further modest reduction could be justified on
the hope that there is more growth to come. But a substantial rerating would
have to wait for hard evidence.
