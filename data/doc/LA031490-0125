ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; 
COUNCIL MAY TURN PARKING CLOCK BACK 
A decision to extend the hours on some parking meters until 10 p.m. may be 
modified this month because merchants have complained that the new policy is 
bad for business. 
The City Council decided during a study session this week to prepare a 
resolution for the March 26 meeting that would limit parking meter hours to 
between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., city traffic engineer Richard M. Edmonston said. 
If approved, the change would take effect immediately. 
In January, the city extended the meter times from 5 p.m. to either 6 p.m. or 
10 p.m. to generate revenue for law enforcement and litter control. 
Parking meters earned just over $1 million for Newport Beach last year, 
according to Edmonston. There was no study on how much money would have been 
generated by extending the time on the meters, he said.
