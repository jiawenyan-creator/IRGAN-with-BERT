<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by </F>
correspondent Udo van Kampen in Brussels on 28 February -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Van Kampen] A few moments ago I had a chance to get 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's first reaction to this first 
NATO military strike. 
  [Kinkel] This is indeed the first NATO strike of this kind 
which shows that if peaceful political solutions are not brought 
about then we will get serious with what we have decided upon. 
  [Van Kampen] Isn't there now the threat that the conflict 
will escalate? 
  [Kinkel] No, I don't think so. Rather, I think that if it 
was the Serb side, it will now be clear to those involved that 
it is a serious matter when the security measures set by the 
Security Council -- in this case the no-fly zone -- are violated. 
  [Van Kampen] If the Serbs retaliate, will NATO continue to 
act consistently? 
  [Kinkel] I am not responsible for NATO decisions, but I 
cannot imagine that the Serbs will retaliate. First we have to 
look at what took place and I assume that all the details will 
come to light soon. 
  [Van Kampen] Were German crews involved in the so-called 
AWACS flights, the reconnaissance flights? 
  [Kinkel] That is still being looked into at the moment. I 
can't tell you that for sure yet. If they were involved, it 
will have been within the framework of their mission which was 
approved by the Federal Constitutional Court. 
  [Van Kampen] Do you assume, or have you already been in 
touch 
and know, that the Russians approve of this mission? 
  [Kinkel] No. I haven't had sufficient time to do that yet, 
but I've instructed the office in Bonn to make all sorts of 
inquiries and as soon as I have more news I will be happy to 
tell you. 
  [Van Kampen] The Russians did support Security Council 
Resolution 816 when it was made. 
  [Kinkel] Yes, of course. They knew that things could get 
serious in a case such as this if an unpermitted violation of 
the no-fly zone took place and this is evidently what happened 
here. It has been said -- and I am not in a position to confirm 
this either because I don't know -- that the planes either 
attacked a munition factory beforehand or intended to attack it.
