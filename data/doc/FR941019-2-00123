The general jurisdictional reach of Section 7 is co-extensive with the reach of the Sherman Act, as a result of the 1980
amendment of the Clayton Act extending it to all matters affecting commerce, which includes trade or commerce with
foreign nations.

 Thus, the Agencies would apply the same principles regarding their foreign commerce jurisdiction to Clayton Section
7 cases as they would apply in Sherman Act cases.

Illustrative Example B





Situation

: Two foreign firms, one in Europe and the other in Canada, account together for 80% of U.S. sales of a particular product.
Neither firm has a U.S. subsidiary, and neither has productive assets in the United States; instead, both serve the
U.S. market purely through direct imports. They enter into an agreement to merge.



Discussion

: As noted above, the jurisdictional provisions of Section 7 of the Clayton Act reach the stock and asset acquisitions
of persons engaged in ``any activity affecting commerce.'' In assessing jurisdiction under Section 7 for international
transactions the Agencies analyze the question of effects on commerce in a manner consistent with the foreign Trade
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982 (``FTAIA'')
<FOOTCITE>49</FOOTCITE>
: that is, they look to see whether the effects on U.S. domestic or import commerce are direct, substantial, and reasonably
foreseeable.
<FOOTCITE>50</FOOTCITE>
 It is appropriate to do so because the FTAIA sheds light on the type of effects Congress considered necessary for foreign
commerce cases, even though the FTAIA itself did not amend the Clayton Act. On the facts of this example, the Agencies
would conclude that Section 7 jurisdiction exists.
<FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>
 While the transaction may be subject to the terms of the HSR Act (assuming size of person and size of transaction thresholds
are met), it would appear to be exempted by 16 CFR 802.51(b). See Section 4.22

If it appears in a particular case that effective relief may be difficult to obtain, the case may be one in which the Agencies
would seek to coordinate their efforts with other authorities who are examining the transaction. Through concepts
such as ``positive comity,'' one country's authorities may ask another country to take measures that address possible
harm to competition in the requesting country's market.

3.13Jurisdiction Over Conduct Involving Other Commerce



With respect to foreign commerce other than imports, the jurisdictional limits of the Sherman Act and the FTC Act are
delineated in the FTAIA.



3.131The Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982



The FTAIA provides, in nearly identical language in both the Sherman Act and the FTC Act, that the statutes:




* * * shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce (other than import trade or import commerce) with foreign
nations unless_
