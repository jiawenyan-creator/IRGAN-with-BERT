FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: German metals group to float
part of holding
Metallgesellschaft, the German metals and chemicals group, plans to raise
CDollars 125m (USDollars 94.5m) through a public offering of part of its
stake in Metall Mining, its Toronto-based international mining subsidiary.
The offering will cut Metallgesellschaft's stake in Metall to 50.1 per cent
from about 60 per cent.
The 11.6m shares up for sale are part of a block of 15.9m which Metall
recently issued to the German parent in exchange for Metallgesellschaft's
European copper smelting assets. The rest of the Metall block has been sold
in a private transaction to Minorco, the South African-controlled mining
group.
A public offering, originally scheduled for October, was cancelled due to
tumbling copper prices. However, share prices of mining companies on the
Toronto stock exchange have surged in the past week or two. 'The sentiment
has changed,' one corporate finance specialist said.
The Metall shares will be offered at CDollars 10.75 each, the same price
mooted for the earlier issue. The sale is being underwritten by a group of
securities dealers led by Gordon Capital and Burns Fry of Toronto.
Metall's share price gained 37 cents to CDollars 11 before yesterday's
announcement.
