PEOPLE: AOKIS RUNNING WESTIN 
Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts has named Chieko N. Aoki chief executive, in 
addition to her current duties as deputy chairman of the chain. She succeeds 
Harry Mullikin, 62, who is retiring as chairman and chief executive after a 
dozen years in those posts. 
John H. Aoki, president and chief executive of Aoki Corp., becomes chairman of 
the hotel chain. The husband-and-wife team are taking the helm at Westin 14 
months after buying the chain, which has headquarters in Seattle and operates 
65 hotels worldwide. Aoki Corp. is a major Japanese construction firm. 
"I've been with the company for 48 years," said Mullikin, who started working 
at a Westin hotel in Wenatchaee, Wash., at age 14 as an elevator operator. "My 
wife and I kind of think it would nicer to spend more time sailing and having a 
nicer life." 
He will become chairman emeritus and a senior adviser to the Aokis. 
Larry B. Magnan continues as Westin's president and John Chen as vice chairman.
