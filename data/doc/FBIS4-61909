  [Text] Aleksandre Kavsadze, the chairman of the Georgian 
State Committee of Human Rights and Interethnic Relations, met 
Tevfik Okayuz, the Turkish ambassador extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary to Georgia. During the conversation issues 
pertaining to the protection of human rights in Georgia and 
ethnic minorities were discussed. Kavsadze admitted to certain 
violations of human rights in Georgia. However, the very 
existence of the committee he is chairing created on the 
initiative of the head of state proves that in future human 
rights protection will become a cornerstone of state policy. 
Aleksandre Kavsadze has also said that the committee is working 
on a draft law on ethnic minorities in the Republic and this 
draft law will soon be submitted to the Supreme Council for 
consideration.
