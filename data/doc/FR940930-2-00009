SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice is published pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 47(a)(2) and 41 CFR 5123. Its purpose is to provide interested
persons an 
opportunity to submit comments on the possible impact of the 
proposed actions. 


If the Committee approves the proposed additions, all entities of 
the Federal Government (except as otherwise indicated) will be 
required to procure the commodities and services listed below from 
nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other 
severe disabilities. 
 
I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the 
commodities and services to the Government. 
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
current contractors for the commodities and services. 
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the commodities and services to the Government. 
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 4648c) in connection with the commodities and services 
proposed for addition to the Procurement List. 
Comments on this certification are invited. Commenters should 
identify the statement(s) underlying the certification on which 
they are providing additional information.
