FT  21 OCT 94 / People: River &amp; Mercantile poaches HSBC asset management duo
Nigel Legge, 36, and William Carey, 33, who have worked together at
Henderson Administration and HSBC Asset Management, have been head-hunted to
spearhead the River &amp; Mercantile investment trust group's entry into the
fast-growing unit trust business.
It is understood that Legge, right, and Williams have been tempted away from
HSBC by the promise of a substantial equity stake in River &amp; Mercantile
Asset Management, a new subsidiary which will oversee the unit trust
operation.
River &amp; Mercantile is the flagship of one of Britain's oldest investment
trusts, which has been looking around for a new role for some time.
Earlier this year Mercury Asset Management, one of the industry leaders,
considered taking it over to expand its own investment trust operation.
However, this came to nothing and in September John Beckwith, a wealthy
property developer, and Chris Munro, 45, a former head of corporate broking
at Robert Fleming, bought a 49.9 per cent stake in River &amp; Mercantile
Investment Management. They have an option to buy another 30 per cent in two
years time.
Up to now River &amp; Mercantile Investment Management, which manages around
Pounds 400m, has concentrated on managing the group's small stable of
investment trusts.
However, Chris Munro, who took over as chief executive last month, wants to
move into the unit trust market and expand the group's international
business, particularly in areas like the Far East.
Legge has been with James Capel Unit Trusts, recently renamed HSBC Asset
Management, for six years and has helped increase its assets under
management from Pounds 50m to Pounds 1bn. Roy Brooks, the overall chief
executive of HSBC's European investment management business will look after
the group's European unit trusts until a successor is found for Legge, who
was managing director of the European unit trust operation, and Carey, the
sales director.
