<F P=106> [Ilirian Bardhi article: "A Victim That Accuses the State </F>
and Not the Real Culprit?! -- Why Does Mr. Keko Not Press 
Charges?] 
  [Text] The extreme politicization of ordinary and even 
banal incidents is nowadays becoming a mass epidemic. Even when 
people are entirely their own victims, are drunk, or are 
involved in immoral and illegal business, they advertise 
themselves or are advertised by others as heroes or innocent 
victims. 
  What is absurd is that in this case too, short-term and 
long-term political calculations have led to the state being 
held to blame. 
  It seems this epidemic has affected Teodor Keko. 
  Keko knows better than anybody how this incident happened. 
It 
is also well known that there is no Albanian who will step out 
in front of you when you are with your wife, if you have not put 
him down in a way you should not. 
  Of course, we do not excuse or in any way support the author 
of this act of violence, but on the other hand it is not fair or 
moral to purposely politicize for the purposes of publicity 
anybody's hooliganism, drunkenness, or ordinary scandals. 
  Keko intentionally and calculatedly accuses the state, when 
it is well known that he was struck in the presence of others, 
and that he knows his assailant and the motive for the attack. 
  Keko's failure so far to press charges against his assailant 
is highly significant and compromising. He would do well to 
turn to the organs of justice in order to fully expose the 
truth. Why does Mr. Keko not do this?
