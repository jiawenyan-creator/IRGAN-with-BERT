FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Maughan to be chairman of
Salomon securities arm
A WEEK after paying a Dollars 290m government fine to settle charges that it
had rigged billion-dollar Treasury bond auctions, Salomon Inc yesterday
appointed Mr Deryck Maughan as chairman and chief executive of its powerful
Wall Street securities subsidiary, Salomon Brothers.
The move, which had been expected, paves the way for the departure of Mr
Warren Buffett who took over as chairman of the parent group last August
after the bond trading scandal which toppled the firm's senior management.
Mr Buffett pledged a few months ago to step down as chairman of Salomon Inc
once the government's investigation was completed, and is expected to
announce his successor soon. No names have been put forward for the job, but
Mr Buffett has already expressed his preference for an independent chairman
without previous ties to the group's two main business units, Salomon
Brothers and Phibro, the oil trading firm.
Mr Maughan's appointment is a reward for his efforts in helping the firm
survive the crisis that engulfed it last summer when federal authorities
discovered bond traders at Salomon had been faking customer orders in
Treasury auctions to get around government restrictions.
While Mr Buffett handled the political and strategic issues of the scandal,
Mr Maughan set about restructuring Salomon's securities trading operations.
Within a few months management structures were redesigned, business
priorities reshaped, and the firm's compensation system overhauled.
Although this created upheaval within the firm and led to defections by some
senior staff, the new Salomon which emerged from the changes was widely
regarded as a better managed, more efficient firm, albeit one still badly
rattled by the scandal and the subsequent loss of business.
Mr Maughan said yesterday he regarded his appointment as 'more an
affirmation of what we've been working on for the past year, than any signal
of a radical departure'.
