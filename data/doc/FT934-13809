Mike Jones has been appointed finance director at ALEXON group; he moves
from the Merchant Retail group, where he was group finance director. He
replaces David Cohen who left on October 1 to join EDS Europe.

institutional shareholders forced a change of management after some dismal
financial results.
Then, Lawrence Snyder stepped down as chairman and Ruth Henderson and Peter
Ridsdale resigned as joint chief operating officers.
John Sadler, a former finance director of the John Lewis Partnership was
appointed non-executive chairman and John Osborn, a former director of
Sears, took over as chief executive.
Alexon lost nearly Pounds 1m before tax last year and passed its final
dividend; it had made an Pounds 11.3m profit in the previous year. Its
interim figures showed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 10.2m, against profits of
Pounds 1.5m last time round.
