FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Trans World back in the black
TRANS WORLD Communications, the Salford based independent radio station
operator, swung from losses of Pounds 1.83m to pre-tax profit of Pounds
1.13m for the year to end-December.
The figure for the previous year, restated from a loss of Pounds 1.15m to
meet FRS 3 accounting rules, included a Pounds 680,000 charge for closing a
subsid-iary.
The improved performance was mainly due to a rise in sales which pushed the
USM-quoted group's turnover up from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 12.1m.
Dividends are being resumed for the first time in three years via a final of
0.8p out of earnings per share of 3.1p (losses 7p).
Investment in promotion and marketing helped the company push up prices.
Airtime sales rose by 3 per cent from Pounds 9.6m to Pounds 9.9m despite a
drop in the number of advertisers.
The group should benefit further when the advertising market picks up.
There are no borrowings. All four radio stations showed an improvement.
