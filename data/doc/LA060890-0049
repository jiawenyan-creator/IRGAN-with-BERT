CAMPUS THEFT RING BROKEN 
San Diego State University police believe they have broken the largest campus 
theft ring in recent history, involving $60,000 of computers and related 
equipment. 
Campus police received reports of 12 thefts from January to this month from 
several university buildings, and they believe three men arrested Monday and 
Tuesday -- including an SDSU student -- are responsible, university detective 
Tom Boyer said. 
Campus police officers Paul Neuharth and Marian Nowak saw Thomas R. Hayes, 19, 
of the 2900 block of Manos Drive in San Diego, carrying a computer out of the 
Disabled Student Services office in the middle of the night, Boyer said. When 
Hayes was confronted by the officers, Boyer reported, "he just said, 'You got 
me.' " 
Police then obtained a search warrant for Hayes' home and a rental garage, 
where they recovered six computers, three printers and other computer equipment 
valued at $45,000, Boyer said. Hayes was arrested on suspicion of 12 counts of 
burglary. Boyer said Hayes used the stolen master keys to get into the 
university buildings. 
The police investigation led to the arrest of SDSU student Joshua L. Robinson, 
19, of the 5000 block of 55th Place. He was arrested on suspicion of one count 
of burglary and has been released from the County Jail on bail. 
Randall W. Smock, 20, of the 1000 block of Leyte Road in Coronado, was also 
arrested in connection with one count of burglary. He has been released from 
the County Jail on his own recognizance.
