FT  09 SEP 94 / Australian port workers on strike
Australia's shipping industry ground to a halt yesterday when port workers
began an indefinite nationwide strike over the government's alleged failure
to develop a restructuring package for the state-owned Australian National
Line, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
Last month the government shelved plans to privatise ANL, claiming it was in
such poor financial condition that it 'couldn't be given away'. The company
has made losses in six of the last seven years. The union claims the
government plans to liquidate the business.
Mr Laurie Brereton, federal transport minister, urged a swift end to the
industrial action, saying it augured badly for government efforts to save
ANL.
Mr Paddy Crumlin, deputy national secretary of the Maritime Union of
Australia, said the strike would affect all ships other than vessels
transporting liquid natural gas to Japan.
The Australian Chamber of Shipping said the strike would cost the economy
millions of dollars and reinforce the low regard in which Australia's
waterfront industry was held overseas. The ACS calculates it costs on
average ADollars 40,000 (Pounds 19,000) a day per vessel to have a ship
idle. Broken Hill Proprietary, the large mining and resources group which
has a significant shipping business, expressed similar dismay.
Foster's Brewing Group, which owns Courage in the UK, is suing Price
Waterhouse for unspecified damages, claiming the international accountancy
firm was negligent and failed to inquire properly into ADollars 66.5m
(Pounds 32m) worth of foreign exchange transactions authorised by executives
in 1988 but now alleged to be 'sham deals'.
The dealings are at the heart of a lengthy committal hearing under way in
Melbourne and involving former executives of Elders IXL, the brewing and
agribusiness group which owned Foster's.
