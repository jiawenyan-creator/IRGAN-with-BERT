FT  27 AUG 92 / Building society ranks may be halved
THERE WILL be only just over half as many building societies by the end of
the century, the industry's leaders believe, according to the results of a
poll in next month's issue of Mortgage Finance Gazette.
A third of building society chief executives believe that 40 of the current
figure of 90 societies will close in the next eight years, though executives
of small societies with assets of less than Pounds 150m remain relatively
optimistic about survival.
The chief executives also believe that sources of profit will shift from
mortgage-related insurance products towards pensions and non-deposit
investment business.
There seems to be general acceptance that new building societies legislation
will not be introduced for at least five years, but that some changes in the
law will be needed much sooner to allow societies to raise more funds in the
commercial money markets.
In spite of this, some society chiefs believe that up to five building
societies will shed mutual status and become banks before the end of the
decade to free themselves of the legal restrictions governing societies.
Bristol &amp; West, the tenth-largest building society, has shut seven of its
eight branches in Scotland with the loss of 34 full-time jobs. It had
already closed five Scottish branches in the past two years.
