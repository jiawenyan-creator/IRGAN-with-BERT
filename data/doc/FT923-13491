FT  13 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Liffe Swiss franc interest rate move
The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) is
to start trading options on its Swiss franc interest rate futures contract
on October 15.
Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe's chairman, said: 'Given the high level of
volatility in EuroSwiss interest rates, there is a need for an instrument
which provides additional hedging and trading opportunities.'
The three-month Euro-Swiss futures contract, launched in February 1991,
recorded an average daily volume of 8,000 contracts in June.
