FT  24 JAN 94 / Arts: Today's Television
Presumably on the day that someone finally manages to explain to everybody
else's satisfaction the differences between the human brain, the human mind
and the human soul, the stars will go out, there will be a Big Bang and the
universe will implode ..so tonight's Horizon probably won't satisfy
everyone.
Gerald Edelman has come up with a new model of the brain to challenge the
'organic computer' idea: he postulates 'neural Darwinism' with a sort of
natural selection producing something more like a rain forest.
Since Edelman is a previous Nobel Prize winner and has now received
USDollars 150m to pursue his idea, we should perhaps listen to him (8.00
BBC2).
John Mortimer's auction house drama, Under The Hammer, (9.00 ITV) does what
the real auction houses are doing and goes to Russia for today's story. For
those who missed the second episode of Middlemarch, BBC1 repeats it at
10.10.
John Penycate reports for Panorama on the plan to spend 23bn on Britain's
roads. Will this ease the present jams or simply encourage more car sales?
(9.30 BBC1).
