  [Text] Mexico City February 8 TASS -- An agreement on 
cultural and scientific cooperation and a programme specifying 
the agreement's provisions were initialed here on Monday at a 
meeting of a mixed commission for cultural cooperation. The 
purpose of the documents is to strengthen and broaden bilateral 
contacts between Mexico and Russia on a new legal-treaty basis. 
  The initialling, that is the coordination of a common 
concept 
of the two documents, enables the state institutions of Russia 
and Mexico to launch practical preparations for exchanges of 
performing groups, museum exhibitions and delegations of partner 
cities, Yuriy Korchagin, representative of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, who attended the commission's session, told ITAR-TASS. 
  The programme for specific bilateral measures in these areas 
of cooperation also provides for financial and technical 
assistance in the establishment of direct contacts between 
higher learning establishments, cultural, sports and other 
organisations of Mexico and Russia. 
  Nikolay Bespalov, charge d'affaires ad interim of the 
Russian 
Federation to this Latin American country, is of the opinion 
that Mexico shows greate interest in the development of mutually 
beneficial cooperation with Russia in culture, education and 
sports, cooperation which has somewhat slowed down since the 
break-up of the Soviet Union. 
  The lack of a new legal basis for the stimulation of such 
contacts led to a paradoxical situation. At a time when many 
prominent Russian groups and performers began to frequent Mexico 
for guest tours on a commercial basis, Russia was not actually 
represented in recent years at big international art festivals 
here, such as, for example, the world-famed Servantino, Bespalov 
said.
