supplementary information: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and the California Toll Road
Company (CTRC) will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on a proposal to construct a toll-operated highway
facility in a corridor between Route 4 and Route 84 in Alameda and Contra Costa Counties, a distance of approximately
48-kilometers (30 miles). The proposed facility would consist generally of a divided limited access roadway. It
is anticipated that majority of the roadway will be located on new alignment. Major roadways in the area are presently
operating at peak hour levels of service (LOS) D to F, and are expected to decline to LOS F before the year 2010. There
are also problems with the regional movement of freight on local roads because of the lack of regional transportation
facilities.



Alternatives under consideration are:

(1) The ``No-Build'' Alternative;

(2) A Transportation Systems Management/Transportation Demand Management Alternative providing incremental
improvements;

(3) A Mass Transit Alternative providing transit improvements, including buses and rail modes;

(4) A divided limited access toll road in a 48-kilometer (30 miles) corridor from the I680/Route 84 Interchange
southwest of the City of Livermore to Route 4 near Antioch; and 

(5) A freeway in the same 48-kilometer (30-mile) corridor. In addition to the alternatives noted above, any other
alternatives identified in the scoping process meetings will be studied and considered during the project development
stage.

Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments were sent to the appropriate Federal, State and local
agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have expressed or are known to have interest in this proposal.
Public scoping and community participation meetings will be held on May 10, 1994 at 6 p.m. at the Tracy Community Center,
300 East 10th Street, Tracy; on May 11, 1994 at 5 p.m. at the Brentwood Lions Club, 3700 Walnut Boulevard, Brentwood
and; at the Triad Corporation Cafeteria at 3055 Triad Drive, Livermore, on May 12, 1994 at 5 p.m. An agency scoping meeting
is scheduled at the Contra Costa Transportation Authority, Pacific Plaza Bldg., 1340 Treat Blvd., Suite 150, Walnut
Creek at 10 a.m. May 12, 1994. The Public Participation Program for this study includes additional community information
meetings and a Public Hearing.

To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties.

Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) should be directed
to the FHWA at the address provided above.
