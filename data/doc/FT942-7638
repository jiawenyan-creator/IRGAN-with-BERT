FT  25 MAY 94 / 800,000 jobs on the line in Europe
Privatisation in Europe could cost more than 800,000 jobs by the end of 1998
as previously sheltered nationalised industries face up to tougher
competition, a joint study by six European economic research institutes
warns today.
The Ereco network of research institutes says that more than 120 companies
in the European Union and the European Free Trade Area, employing more than
3.5m people and with annual sales of Ecu400bn (Pounds 308bn), are candidates
for privatisation. Ereco's forecast suggests more than one in five of the
present labour force in these companies will lose their jobs.
The expected job losses in the period from 1992 to 1998 are concentrated in
France, where 290,000 are expected to go, Italy (180,000) and Germany
(140,000). The heaviest concentration of labour shedding is expected in the
telecommunications sector, where an estimated 268,000 jobs will be lost,
followed by energy (250,000) and transport (77,000).
The Ereco estimates are based on Britain's experience of privatisation and
subsequent corporate restructuring. Five UK privatised industries - British
Telecom, British Gas, British Airways, British Steel and the electricity
supply companies - shed more than 300,000 jobs in the 1980s. The Ereco
report comments: 'The scope of the new privatisation programmes across the
whole of Europe in the 1990s threatens to dwarf this in its employment
impact.'
It predicts that more than 1.1m jobs could be lost if restructuring is
especially severe. Much will depend on how far governments press for
deregulation and market liberalisation in the telecoms and energy sectors.
But 'perhaps only 500,000 jobs will be shed' if output growth turns out to
be particularly strong in the newly privatised industries or if governments
take action to prevent the full employment implications of privatisation
from working through. The report warns, however, that mounting competition
and the reduced opportunity for states to intervene to protect national
champions mean that eventual job losses, totalling about 800,000, are
unlikely to be postponed for long.
Ereco expects privatisation in Europe to become a big political issue. There
will be doubts whether some governments have the political strength to go
ahead with privatisation at a time of high unemployment. However, the poor
budgetary positions of most European states make the revenues from
privatisation very attractive.
