NCAA BASEBALL PLAYOFFS; 
TROJANS BREEZE IN OPENER, 23-5 
Bret Boone homered twice and drove in four runs in a 23-hit attack used by USC 
to rout Southern Mississippi, 23-5, in Thursday's first round of the NCAA South 
I Regional baseball tournament. 
Phil Lewis homered, doubled and scored two runs as Houston beat Georgia Tech, 
4-2, in the tournament opener. 
Host Louisiana State routed Southwestern Louisiana, 8-0, in the final 
first-round game. 
USC (38-20) will play Houston in today's second round of the double-elimination 
tournament. Boone's first homer was part of USC's four-run first inning. He 
added a solo shot in the third inning, his eighth of the year, to go with two 
doubles. John Jackson also had five runs batted in on a single and a double. 
The Trojans set season highs for runs and hits in a game as every starter had 
at least one hit. In the seventh, USC sent 13 men to the plate with every 
batter scoring once. 
"They just ran into a buzzsaw today," said USC starting pitcher Randy Powers 
(11-2), who worked five scoreless innings.
