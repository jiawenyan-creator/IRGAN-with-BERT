  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina also held bilateral meetings with members of the 
delegations from Trinidad and Tobago, Antigua and Barbuda, 
Barbados, and Guyana; and in all cases, the support of Cuba and 
the rejection of the blockade have prevailed. Likewise, the 
delegates conveyed positive expressions of support to Cuba's 
entry into the Association of Caribbean States. 
  At the conclusion of the first day of work by the 
highest-level members of the conference delegations, the path to 
the Declaration of Barbados and the action plan has been paved. 
These documents will be approved at the closing of the 
conference's debates. 
  The need to defend our natural resources and to establish 
policies to enhance the environment, and the quest for ways that 
lead to the survival of the small insular states are the main 
prevailing proposals in this conference. 
  According to the agenda, the first Global Conference on 
Sustainable Development will conclude tomorrow. This conference 
has been going on in the capital of Barbados since 25 April. 
Over the past two days, several chiefs of states and of 
governments have joined experts and active members of various 
organizations participating in this conference.
