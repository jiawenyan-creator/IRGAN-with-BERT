FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Sun Hung Kai raises HKDollars
3.3bn for expansion
SUN Hung Kai Properties, one of Hong Kong's largest property developers,
raised HKDollars 3.3bn (USDollars 426m) after expenses from a share
placement yesterday, to help fund the group's aggressive expansion into the
China property market, writes Simon Davies.
The group is one of Hong Kong's most conservative property developers, but
it has recently signed up a number of projects in neighbouring Guangdong
Province, after focusing on residential projects in the colony's New
Territories.
The company is also involved in a HKDollars 2bn commercial development in
central Beijing, and is examining some large infrastructural projects in the
Pearl River delta.
Sun Hung Kai's shares have risen 50 per cent this year. The company issued
100m new shares at HKDollars 33.25 per share.
