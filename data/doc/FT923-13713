FT  11 JUL 92 / Arts: Canaletto prices strike 80s chord
PAINTINGS by Canaletto fetched the kind of prices made during the boom of
the late '80s at Christie's yesterday.
The better of the two top lots, a view of the Grand Canal in Venice looking
east from the Campo di S. Vio, changed hands for Pounds 1.43m (estimate
Pounds 600,000-Pounds 800,000).
A different buyer paid Pounds 990,000 for a similarly estimated view looking
north from the Rialto bridge.
Both are excellent witness for the case against museums selling off
pictures. The Alte Pinakothek in Munich had sold them in 1939 as it was then
believed they were by Bellotto.
No one now doubts the original attribution to Canaletto. The paintings were
part of a set of four Venetian views by the master once owned by the
celebrated neo-Classical sculptor Antonio Canova. A third Grand Canal scene
by Canaletto and studio realised Pounds 297,000.
The auction went better than might have been expected. Although just under
half the lots of the morning session were bought in, the pictures that ought
to have sold generally found good prices. A small flowerpiece by Ambrosius
Bosschaert II estimated at Pounds 100,000-Pounds 150,000 went to a private
collector for Pounds 209,000. London trade snapped up a van Goyen last seen
on the market in 1946. It sold for Pounds 198,000.
The bargain of the morning was the pair of elegant gold ground panels by
Arcangelo di Cola da Camerino. They had been bought for Dollars 1.1m at
Sotheby's, New York in 1990. Yesterday the vendor was prepared to sell them
for Pounds 330,000.
The morning session totalled Pounds 5,286,600 with 55 per cent sold by
value.
