FT  30 NOV 94 / Disabled scheme gets partial reprieve
The government last night announced a partial reprieve for the priority
suppliers scheme for disabled workshops scrapped earlier this year by Mr
Michael Portillo, employment secretary.
The scheme was discontinued by Mr Portillo immediately after he was promoted
to employment secretary in the July reshuffle of Mr John Major, the prime
minister, on the grounds that it was illegal under European Union
regulations.
Ms Ann Widdecombe, junior employment minister, told MPs in a Commons written
answer that the European Commission, which initially claimed there was no
reason to scrap the scheme, had accepted that it was illegal.
However, Ms Widdecombe said the scheme would be reintroduced under a fresh
title, the special contracts arrangement, with two changes designed to
comply with European Union rules and the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
These will extend eligibility to workshops in other EU and European Economic
Area countries and limit contracts to a maximum of Pounds 96,403 for general
government supplies and Pounds 149,728 for defence ministry clothing orders.
