FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Burton to close 79 IS stores at cost of
Pounds 20m
Burton, the clothing retail group, is to close its 79 discount IS stores
before Christmas, at an expected cost of Pounds 20m.
IS was developed in 1991 as a partly experimental format and a way of
trading from excess space in towns where the Burton group was
over-represented. But, Burton said yesterday, it was expected to make an
operating loss of about Pounds 5m this year.
The group added that the recovery in the property market meant it would now
be easier to dispose of the outlets.
The 500 IS staff would be offered positions in other chains wherever
possible.
The provision to cover IS closure costs and operating losses will be taken
this financial year.
It will be offset by a Pounds 20m property write-back after Burton sold its
remaining retail developments for Pounds 20m more than their written-down
book value.
Burton also reported that sales for the 22 weeks to the end of July were 3.1
per cent higher than last year.
Sales at Debenhams were up by 5.2 per cent, while Burton's multiple chains
lifted sales by 1.5 per cent.
In the multiples, Dorothy Perkins, Top Shop and Top Man turned in good
performances. These balanced out continuing problems at the Burtons men's
wear chain, where sales were down and mark-downs were necessary to clear
stocks.
There were signs of improvement at Principles, where a new management team
was sorting out the stock and shop design problems which depressed the
chain's performance last year.
Group gross margins were down 0.6 percentage points, but this was an
improvement from the 2.3 point fall reported at the interim stage.
Burton said it was continuing to reduce the level of discounted sales.
Analysts are predicting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 40m for the year to
September 3.
