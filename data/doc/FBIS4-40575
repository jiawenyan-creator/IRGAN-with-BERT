  [Text] Moscow (DDP/ADN) -- The Russian Nuclear Energy 
Ministry in Moscow has denied reports by the environmental 
organization Greenpeace that plutonium fuel rods from Germany 
are to be transported to the southern Urals for use at Beloyarsk 
nuclear power station. "We have no information confirming these 
reports," a spokesman for the ministry told DDP/ADN news agency 
today in response to a query. He pointed out that it is 
"technically extremely difficult" to use foreign fuel rods in 
Russian nuclear plants. 
  Greenpeace says 123 fuel rods originally intended for use in 
a fast breeder at Kalkar are to be "disposed of" in Beloyarsk. 
It said research conducted in the southern Urals reveals that 
an Essen- based operating firm, 
Schnell-Brueter-Kernkraftwerksgesellschaft (SBK), a subsidiary 
of RWE, wants to transport the fuel rods to Beloyarsk for use in 
the BN-600 breeder, which is regarded as unsafe. Greenpeace 
bases its report on comments by the chief engineer at the power 
station. 
  A malfunction at Beloyarsk in early May resulted in a fire 
in 
the plant's third reactor which took several hours to put out. 
Radioactivity did not escape. 
  The 123 fuel rods, which Greenpeace says contain 1.1 tonnes 
of plutonium, are currently being stored in a Siemens-owned 
bunker in Hanau under federal supervision.
