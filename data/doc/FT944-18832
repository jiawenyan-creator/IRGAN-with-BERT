FT  01 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Gestetner shock
Gestetner reacted dramatically to the news of a Pounds 6.1m loss in the
futures market, diving 23 to 123p as analysts took a gloomy view of the
immediate profits outlook.
The feeling was that Gestetner is wiping the slate clean in one go but at a
big cost to earnings. Plainly the futures loss will cut a substantial swathe
through Gestetner's cash-flow if profit estimates of Pounds 21m pre-tax for
this year are anywhere near the mark.

p.

Shares in sports wear and shoe company Hi-Tec Sports tumbled 33 to 45p,
after it said the six month period to January 1995 'will still be tough' and

in a contested bid. BAe recovered part of yesterday's 15 fall, improving 3
1/2 to 452 1/2 p.
GKN shares were a feature of a buoyant Footsie, jumping 12 1/2 to 616 1/2 p

presentation to Scottish analysts.
