FT  11 MAY 94 / Record sales of summer holidays
Summer holidays sold through agents are expected to reach a record 9m this
year, but average prices are lower than they were three years ago, the
travel retailer Lunn Poly said yesterday.
Lunn Poly said summer sales this year were expected to be 13 per cent higher
than last year, breaking the previous record of 8m set in 1987.
However, the chain's price data disclosed that the increase in holidays sold
was achieved by heavy price discounting.
