FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Airtours secures bond facilities
Airtours yesterday secured bonding facilities worth Pounds 92m over the next
five years. The bond is a condition laid down by the Civil Aviation
Authority to all holiday groups before being granted an operating licence,
writes Christopher Price.
However, the size of the bond is over twice that required by Airtours,
fuelling speculation that it is eyeing candidates for acquisition.
Mr Harry Coe, finance director, said: 'The reason we have gone for such a
large bond is because of the very good response from the banks, and also to
give us room for expansion. We are sitting on a lot of money, but not on our
hands. We are out there looking.'
