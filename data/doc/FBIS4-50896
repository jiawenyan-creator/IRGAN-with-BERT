  [Text] Wuhan, May 20 (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing, a top leader 
of China's armed forces, has called for efforts to speed up the 
modernization of China's national defence with new and high 
technology. 
  During a recent inspection of central China's Hubei 
Province, 
Liu, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, said that 
China's military industry must follow closely the development of 
new and high technology in the world and combine 
Chinese-developed technology with sophisticated foreign 
technology. 
  "China now places economic construction above all...so the 
defence science and technology and the military industry must 
also be subordinate to and serve the central task of economic 
construction, and do their utmost to aid the growth of local 
industries and China's economy as a whole," he told local 
officials. 
  During his stay in Hubei, Liu visited a shipyard, a cable 
company and the Donghu New and High-Tech Development Zone in the 
Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan, as well as construction sites 
for the gigantic Three Gorges project and Gezhouba 
hydro-electric power station on the Chang Jiang river.
