FT  18 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Volkswagen
At DM136m, Volkswagen's third-quarter after-tax profits were only DM3m
higher than they were in the previous three months. But a pronounced
recovery is nonetheless under way. The DM73m loss in the full nine months
compares with losses of DM1.5bn in the same period last year.
The key to the earnings revival is aggressive cost-cutting, evident in
virtually unchanged production costs and reduced sales and administrative
expenditure. This is impressive when turnover was up 4.1 per cent to
DM58.8bn in the first nine months. But VW still faces a major cost headache.
Analysts predict that even if rationalisation continues at the current pace,
the net profit margin will only reach 2.6 per cent by 1996 - lower than for
other European volume producers and half the level achieved by the big US
manufacturers. The crunch will come when VW renegotiates the four-day
working week which runs out next year. Sharply reduced 'other income'
yesterday suggests that the group has made higher provisions. If these are
used to cut staff aggressively, so much the better.
Shareholders must assume that their interests will always be secondary to
those of the government of Lower Saxony, which, as VW's largest shareholder,
is concerned more with politics than profits. However, even if VW does not
become as lean as its European and US competitors, there is scope for a
strong improvement in profits later in the decade as sales start to climb
rapidly in response to new models and economic recovery. It may be that
earnings per share will recover to more than DM100 at the cyclical peak, in
which case the shares are cheap at yesterday's price of DM455.
