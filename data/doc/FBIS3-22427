  [Text] The dumping of liquid nuclear waste in the Sea of 
Japan by vessels of the Pacific Fleet may be carried out only if 
permitted by the Russian Government. An ITAR-TASS correspondent 
learned this at the press center of the Russian Navy when he 
asked the center to comment on a report published in Japan's 
MAINICHI. Citing the head of the chemical service of the 
Pacific Fleet, Valeriy Danilyan, the newspaper wrote that Russia 
may resume the discharge of the waste in the Sea of Japan in May 
this year if foreign countries, including Japan, fail to provide 
financial aid for building special units. The press center of 
the Russian Navy said that this is just a personal opinion of 
one of the commanders of the Pacific Fleet. The Russian 
Government has made no decision concerning the dumping of 
nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan.
