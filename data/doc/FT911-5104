FT  16 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
THE LONDON stock market was led higher yesterday by equity futures, which
continued to anticipate an end to the recession later in the year.
With locals short of futures the market quickly moved to a premium of 40
points to the spot index and shares were promptly marked higher.
Dealers said the move up had been largely technical and there had been few
buyers. Instead a cluster of sellers waited for their opportunity. When the
FT-SE index failed to clear 2,550 the sellers pounced.
Pressure from US equity futures as the Federal Reserve indicated that it
would not ease monetary policy triggered further selling. UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew said buying futures at current levels would anticipate only good
economic news and recommended investors sell futures.
June FT-SE closed at 2,576, up 18 points on the day and 31 points above the
cash index, which is close to fair value.
In traded options, BP April 330 calls were actively traded as the shares
rallied. Euro FT-SE was boosted as institutions bought December 2,525 calls
and sold 2,725 calls for the same month, suggesting the market would not
rise much further by the year end.
Boots calls were actively traded as investors bought back their option
positions and rolled them into other forward months.
