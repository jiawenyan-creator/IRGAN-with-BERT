P.M. BRIEFING; 
AMOCO SIGNS OIL PACT WITH EGYPT 
Amoco Corp. today said it has signed an agreement with Egypt for oil 
exploration in four areas totaling 10,036 square miles, but denied reports of a 
joint venture with Atlantic Richfield Co. for Egyptian exploration. 
"There is no agreement with ARCO," said spokesman Greg Clock at Amoco's Chicago 
headquarters when asked about news reports of a $126.3-million agreement to 
explore jointly for oil and gas in Egypt. 
A spokesman at ARCO's Los Angeles headquarters also could not confirm any joint 
agreement with Amoco. 
Exploration will be in four "concessions" -- the Sallum area of the western 
Sahara, the central Sinai region, and two in the Gulf of Suez, Clock said.
