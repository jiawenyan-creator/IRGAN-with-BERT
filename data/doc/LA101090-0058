SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: KEDER, DOUGHERTY TO TRY OUT WITH SOCKERS 
With the Major Soccer League season nine days away, the Sockers continue to 
audition free agents for four remaining roster spots. 
Forward Keder, who scored 28 goals while playing 36 games for the Sockers 
during the 1987-88 season, arrived Tuesday, according to President Ron Cady. 
Midfielder Paul Dougherty will show up today, Coach Ron Newman said. 
Dougherty played three seasons with the Sockers before going to Baltimore as a 
free agent last year. His best year was in 1987-88, when he was second on the 
team in goals (40) and assists (24). 
Like Keder, Dougherty's no lock. 
"Let me say this," Newman said. "We're not bringing Paul in -- he's bringing 
himself in." 
Added Cady, "I don't even know if we want to sign him." 
But Newman appeared anxious to get Dougherty in the fold. 
"Paul would be a good exciting asset," he said. "He has experience (four years 
in the MSL), and we need experienced players." 
Dougherty severed his ties with Baltimore when he decided to go back to outdoor 
soccer in his native England. He has since cooled on that idea, Newman said. 
In other news, the Sockers have ended talks with free-agent midfielder Michael 
Collins, Newman said. Also, Cady said the team may reopen talks with midfielder 
Jacques Ladouceur. Ladouceur, one of only two players to play in all 52 games 
last year, was offered a contract before training camp, but refused to sign, 
saying it was too low of an offer. JOHN GEIS
