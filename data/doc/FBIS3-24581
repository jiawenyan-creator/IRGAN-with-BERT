  [Abstract] Polarization-anisotropic (PA) light scattering, 
i.e. scattering with polarization rotation exhibited in the 
ferroelectric crystals is examined. The dynamic model of the PO 
scattering is qualitatively substantiated and the physical model 
of this phenomenon in the LiNbO[.sup]3[/] is clarified. Data 
are provided demonstrating a significant difference in the 
development of the polarization anisotropic (PA) and 
polarization isotropic (PI) time characteristics. For the 
PA-scattering, a long lasting time delay of the beginning of 
development and longer times (by the factor of 5-10) of reaching 
the equilibrium state are typical. In the proposed model, the PA 
scattering is related to the noise of the fluctuating fields, 
perpendicular to the Z axis, which are induced by the 
photo-galvanic current flowing parallel to the Z axis. Light, 
scattered by the noise field, undergoes a non-steady state 
holographic amplification. The holograms are recorded due to 
interaction between the beams of PA and PI-scattering and the 
fundamental beam. It was demonstrated that in the case of 
PA-scattering, the holographic gratings can also act as the 
scattering centers. The latter are recorded by the beams of the 
PA-scattering, while the Braggs conditions are fulfilled only 
for the fundamental beam. The experimental data indicate that 
hologram recording in the LiNbO[.sup]3[/] can occur only due 
to the scalar interference. Reasons causing the scattering of 
the regular wave into an irregular wave and vice versa are 
discussed. Figures 6, references 7 Russian
