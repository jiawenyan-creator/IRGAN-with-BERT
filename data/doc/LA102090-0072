GANG BUSTERS 
For youthful gang members, the ways of the street have an imperative all their 
own, often at odds with the self-discipline needed to get an education. The 
Anaheim Union High School District has a program that is successfully enticing 
some of them back into the education system against heavy odds. 
Its victories to date are modest, with small class sizes and small numbers of 
students managing to turn their lives around. But as one teacher says of her 
class, "If we can help four of these nine students, that's four more students 
back in school." 
The program allows students who have dropped out of high school to study at 
their own pace and earn credits by meeting twice a week during after-school 
hours. The very idea of Project SAY, which is an acronym for Save A Youth, says 
something about the power of education to rescue lives. There are cases where 
members of as many as three rival gangs find themselves in the same classroom, 
but participants are made to understand that they are to leave their colors and 
turf battles outside. 
Just getting gang members into the program can be trying. Some students are 
diverted by the problems of their lives, or they lack motivation. Others simply 
are afraid to cross gang lines to attend classes. Undaunted, the program 
director combs the barrio to recruit candidates. 
It's a tough-minded approach to a tough world. For its commitment to this 
valuable project, Anaheim deserves encouragement and support.
