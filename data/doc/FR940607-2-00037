Description: 

On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 added Section 309(j) to the Communications Act of
1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. Sections 151713. Section 309(j) gives the Commission express authority to employ
competitive bidding procedures to choose among mutually exclusive applications for initial licenses. The Commission's
March 8, 1994 Second Report and Order established general rules and procedures and a broad menu of competitive bidding
methods to be used for all auctionable services. The Third Report and Order establishes service-specific rules for
competitive bidding on licenses to be awarded for Personal Communications Services in the 900 MHz band (``narrowband
PCS''). Generally, the Commission followed the payment and procedural rules adopted in the Second Report and Order
in conducting narrowband PCS auctions, but made minor changes to adjust the requirements to the characteristics
of the narrowband PCS service. In addition, procedural and processing rules for the narrowband PCS service based
on part 22 of the Commission's rules were adopted. Applicants are required to file certain information so that the
Commission can determine whether the applicants are legally, technically and financially qualified to be licensed.
Affected public are any member of the public who wants to become a licensee.
