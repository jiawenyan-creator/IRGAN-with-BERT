SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CORONADO 
A 24-year-old man was in critical condition Wednesday night at UC San Diego 
Medical Center after his motorcycle hit the rear of a truck on the Coronado 
Bridge. 
Noel Howard of Imperial Beach was riding west on the bridge about 8:10 a.m. 
Wednesday and apparently did not notice a Caltrans sign truck ahead of him, 
said a spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol. 
Howard drove into the truck, flew off his bike and slammed into the rear of the 
truck, according to a CHP report.
