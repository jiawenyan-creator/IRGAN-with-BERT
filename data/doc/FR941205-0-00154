SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Paperwork Reduction Act 


The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), and have been assigned OMB control number
2502-0500. 


I. Introduction 


Section 542(c) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992) (1992
Act) as amended by the Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-233, approved April
11, 1994) (1994 Act) authorizes the HUD Secretary to enter into risk-sharing agreements with qualified State or local
Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) to test the effectiveness of certain Federal mortgage loan credit enhancements.
(Section 542(c) is a part of subtitle C, title V of the 1992 Act. Section 541 provides that subtitle C, which consists
of sections 541 through 544, may be cited as the ``Multifamily Housing Finance Improvement Act.'' This rule implements
only section 542(c).) The purpose of section 542(c) is to increase the supply of affordable multifamily housing through
partnerships with housing finance agencies (HFAs) where the Department provides full insurance under a risk-sharing
agreement to test the effectiveness of providing new forms of Federal credit enhancement for multifamily loans,
an intended benefit of which would be increased credit ratings on bond-financed mortgage loans. HUD envisions that,
under this program, HFAs will have greater access to capital markets and be able to provide affordable housing in a
manner that is both timely and efficient. 
The term ``partnership'' as used in the preceding paragraph and in section 542 is used in the generic sense and not in
the technical legal sense. It is not intended to impose any partnership liability on HUD in the event of negligence
or other actionable misconduct by an HFA. 
The basic structure of the program allows HFAs to carry out certain HUD functions under the program, including the
assumption of loan management and property disposition responsibilities for defaulted loans. In the event of a loan
default, the HFA is required to share with HUD in any loss arising as a consequence of the loan default. 
Section 542(c) prescribes certain requirements for this program, and also authorizes the Secretary to issue such
regulations as may be necessary to carry out the program. 


II. Legislative Background 


The 1992 Act contains definitions for what constitutes ``multifamily housing'' (section 544(1)), a ``qualified''
HFA (section 544(2)), and ``affordable housing'' (section 542(c)(7)). These definitions have been incorporated
into the regulation at 24 CFR 266.5. 
In addition, section 542(c) prescribes a number of requirements for the program, which may be summarized as follows:



General:

 HUD is required to execute risk-sharing agreements with qualified HFAs. 


Mortgage insurance:

 Risk-sharing agreements must provide for HUD to fully insure mortgage loans originated by or through HFAs, and for
reimbursement to HUD by HFAs for a portion of any losses incurred on the insured loans.
