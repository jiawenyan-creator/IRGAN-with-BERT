FT  30 OCT 92 / How projections measure up
AS THE economy has slumped, so have the reputations of many of Britain's
leading economists, virtually all of whom have been slow to spot how bad the
recession would become.
The table ranks economists according to the accuracy of their growth
projections since the recession started. For each year in the study, an
average of each organisation's monthly growth forecasts has been built up.
The difference between the average for each organisation in a particular
year and actual growth provides a measure of forecasting accuracy.
Although even the top-ranked forecasters were some way out in their
projections, the analysis provides insights into who was on the right track.
Because of its use of large numbers of monthly forecasts, the study picks up
better than other analyses the degree to which forecasters update their
projections. That biases it slightly against organisations such as the
Treasury which update their projections relatively infrequently.
However, two of the top 10 forecasters update their projections only four or
five times a year. The table includes only those forecasters who have
published regular projections from early 1990 on.
