  [Text] Transkei military leader Major General Bantu 
Holomisa says once the ANC [African National Congress] comes 
into power it will see to it that all defense force weapons kept 
in private homes are returned to the force. He was addressing 
students at the University of the Western Cape today. 
  [Begin recording] [SABC correspondent Gary Alfonso] Gen. 
Holomisa told a cheering crowd of about 3,000 students that more 
people have died of violence in the period before the election 
than during the liberation struggle. He said there is an urgent 
need to restore law and order in the contry, something which, he 
said, the National Party is unable to do. He said the ANC 
envisages a two-phased process of disarmament. 
  [Holomisa, in English] We will refer the matter to the 
constituent assembly and it is debated there, so that all those 
weapons which the right-wingers are carrying all over the 
streets of South Africa can be returned back to the stores where 
they belong. 
  [Alfonso] Gen. Holomisa said the second phase will involve 
cooperation with South Africa's neighbors to prevent illegal 
weapons from being brought into the country. [end recording]
