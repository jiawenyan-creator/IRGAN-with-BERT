  [Text] Our correspondent this evening telephoned Zugdidi 
commander Adamia, who told us that all day it was quiet on the 
territory adjacent to the Abkhaz border, and the extremists did 
not attempt to cross over the Enguri. The situation on the 
eastern bank of the Enguri is being controlled by the Georgian 
military police.
