  [Text] Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri has revealed 
that an expanded Lebanese-Syrian summit meeting will be held at 
1100 tomorrow. He said that the Geneva Summit has placed the 
key in the lock but we must not be hasty and think that the 
doors have been opened. 
  Speaker Birri met today with Chairman of the Editors 
Association Milhim Karam and the Association Council members. 
He called for maintaining the principles that were established 
at the beginning of the present regime. These are: national 
solidarity, first and foremost; solidarity with fraternal Syria; 
and adherence to UN Security Council Resolution 425. 
  He said that Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad has placed the 
ball in the Israeli court, but we must not be overly optimistic. 
He expressed the view that Israel will try to find a way to 
dodge the new U.S. position. 
  After stressing the importance of internal solidarity, he 
maintained that the recent explosions and tension were done 
before the U.S.-Syrian summit to divert attention from the need 
to liberate the occupied border strip and to discuss ways to 
calm the situation. 
  Regarding his holiness the pope's visit to Lebanon, Speaker 
Birri confirmed that this visit will take place and that all 
Lebanese will welcome his holiness the pope because it will 
benefit Lebanon and the Arabs.
