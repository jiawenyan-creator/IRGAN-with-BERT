FT  05 AUG 93 / Yeltsin hits out on rouble
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin said yesterday that the controversial rouble
reform was in general a good idea but its implementation had been badly
prepared, agencies report.
Mr Yeltsin told second world war veterans in the southern city of Oryol that
discord between the central bank and finance ministry was to blame for the
reform fiasco.
'On the whole, the bank's decision is understandable,' he said. The large
number of different banknotes in circulation had whipped up inflation and
helped crime.
But he said the move had been 'poorly thought out and poorly prepared'.
The central bank caused turmoil with its decision last month to withdraw
pre-1993 roubles and to give people only a short time to change over a
limited amount of old banknotes. Mr Yeltsin, who had been away on holiday,
softened the terms of the move, allowing more time to change a larger amount
of old cash.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, who was out of the country when the
central bank acted, has condemned the move as economically and politically
harmful.
Mr Yeltsin, who was trying to revive his political popularity with his visit
to Oryol, told agricultural researchers that free market reforms would
continue despite the efforts of hardliners in the Russian parliament.
Leyla Boulton adds: The Association of Russian Banks said yesterday it had
asked the Constitutional Court to examine the central bank's controversial
and botched rouble reform. The association said the central bank had
exceeded its authority and violated citizens' property rights.
