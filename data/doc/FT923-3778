FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: US trouble cuts Haden to Pounds 2.4m
THE SHARE price of Haden MacLellan Holdings fell by nearly a third yesterday
to 26 1/2 p after the industrial conglomerate announced a 69 per cent profit
fall and slashed its interim dividend.
Pre-tax profit slid to Pounds 2.43m (Pounds 7.94m) in the first half on
turnover of Pounds 142m (Pounds 173m). The interim dividend is cut by 2p to
1p, covered by earnings of 1.5p (5.5p).
Yesterday's share price fall exacerbated the deterioration which set in in
May, when the price topped 120p. Profits forecasts have been subject to a
string of downgradings.
Mr Mel Hawley, chief executive, said the main problems arose in the US,
where Pounds 2.5m was lost in the paint-spraying equipment business and in
the environmental sub-division.
Soft demand from car makers had squeezed margins 'and the work that we had
won was not executed to budget.' New management had uncovered problems that
had not been disclosed previously.
The North American part of the automated manufacturing systems division lost
Pounds 1.6m, compared with Pounds 495,000 profit. Europe and Australia made
Pounds 3.72m (Pounds 4.34m).
The environmental section, hit as US companies cut pollution abatement
programmes, trebled losses to Pounds 998,000.
Mr Hawley said the group had 'tried to get rid of all the bad news' with
these results. Some improvement was expected in the second half.
Distribution, a UK operation involving machine tools and nuts and bolts,
slipped to Pounds 1.85m (Pounds 2.04m). Manufacturing fell to Pounds 950,000
(Pounds 1.68m).
The results were also affected by a Pounds 550,000 write down in property
values and a few business disposals.
Net cash of nearly Pounds 18m in December, mainly advance payments from
customers, had been used and net debt was expected to be Pounds 10m by the
year-end.
The group also announced the appointment as new non-executive chairman of Mr
Harold Cottam, until recently UK managing partner at accountants Ernst &amp;
Young. He replaces Mr Philip Ling, who built up the group in the 1980s but
who had increasingly taken a back seat.
