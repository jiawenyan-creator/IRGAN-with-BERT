The Proposal






The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend Class E airspace
at Lamar, Colorado, to provide controlled airspace for a new instrument approach procedure at the Lamar Municipal
Airport. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet AGL is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The
area would be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference.


The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace
areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order
7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The
Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.



The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore,_(1)
is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
