CHP MOTORCYCLIST HURT IN COLLISION 
An off-duty California Highway Patrol officer was injured Tuesday when his 
motorcycle collided with a car that had just left the parking lot of McGaugh 
Elementary School. 
Officer Jeffrey Giovinetti was reported in a stable condition at Los Alamitos 
Hospital, where he was treated for cuts to his head, face and both hands, CHP 
Officer Lyle Whitten said. 
Giovinetti was driving south on Seal Beach Boulevard when his car collided with 
a car driven by Kathleen Gester of Long Beach, as she tried to turn left from 
the school's parking lot. Whitten said Giovinetti was thrown about 37 feet. 
Gester suffered minor injuries and was taken to the Long Beach Memorial 
Hospital. Her niece, a passenger, was not injured, Whitten said.
