<DOCTITLE>Walker Manufacturing Company Hebron, OH; Notice of Negative Determination on Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>




On August 12, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for workers and former workers of the subject firm. This notice was published in the Federal Register

 on August 23, 1994 (59 FR 43362).

In the United Auto Workers' application for reconsideration they submitted a list of assets from the Hebron plant
that have been shipped to Mexico.

The findings show that the Hebron facility will be closed by the end of 1994 and its business distributed to other corporate
domestic plants. Only the production of resonator bodies was transferred to Canada; however, this accounted for
only a very small portion of Hebron's total production and the workers were not separately identifiable by product.

New findings on reconsideration show that there is no production being transferred to Mexico as a result of the closure
of the Hebron plant. The closing is the result of capacity issues within Walker Manufacturing in North America.

Other findings on reconsideration show that Hebron is making its machinery available to other corporate North American
plants, including the one in Mexico.

Additional findings on reconsideration show that the Mexican plant produces exhaust systems only for the Mexican
market. The Hebron plant produces exhaust systems only for a major original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in the United
States.

The Department's survey of Hebron's customers shows that they did not decrease their purchases from Hebron and increase
their imports in the relevant period.



Conclusion



After reconsideration, I affirm the original notice of negative determination of eligibility to apply for transitional
adjustment assistance to workers and former workers of the Walker Manufacturing Company in Hebron, Ohio.




Signed at Washington, D.C., this 7th day of October.
