  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico, 6 May (AFP) -- Justice 
Prosecutor General Arturo Becerra has reported the Chiapas 
Justice Prosecutor's Office has dispatched 60 policemen to the 
village of Bochil, where the presence of 300 armed men was 
reported several days ago. 
  Another group of policemen is already working in the region 
trying to determine the whereabouts of two inmates who on the 
morning of 4 May were broken out of prison by the group of armed 
men, who had their faces painted black and covered with 
kerchiefs. 
  According to Becerra, armed individuals with their faces 
covered, allegedly planning to release other prison inmates, 
have been seen near Bochil, a town of approximately 15,000 
residents located some 150 km north of Tuxtla Gutierrez. The two 
prison inmates were serving time for rustling. 
  The Zapatist National Liberation Movement started an armed 
uprising in this state on 1 January, suspended military actions, 
and is presently holding peace talks with the federal government.
