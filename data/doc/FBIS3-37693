  [Text] After intensive negotiations in Prague, Andrey 
Kozyrev arrived in the Hungarian capital today. During the 
meeting with Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky, the 
parties talked not only about bilateral relations, but also 
about the Yugoslav crisis. Despite a wish to please NATO, so 
desirable to the countries of the Visegrad Four, Hungary is not 
inclined to support the bombing of Serb artillery. Serbs and 
Croats are its closest neighbors. Any escalation of the 
conflict will result in thousands of refugees and the 
instability on the border. Meanwhile the economic blockade of 
the former Yugoslavia has already cost Hungary $1.0003 billion. 
The Hungarian position is therefore close to the Russian one, 
and this was reaffirmed by the two ministers. 
  However, their approach to the expansion of NATO remains 
different. The Partnership for Peace is seen in Budapest as a 
first step toward NATO membership. However, Hungarians realize 
that they would need enormous financial means, as well as time, 
in order to join NATO. 
  Tomorrow Andrey Kozyrev will continue his talks with 
Hungarian leaders.
