  [Text] Radio Moldova has reported that yesterday there was 
a powerful explosion in a building in the center of Tiraspol. 
Citing a communique released by the press center of the 
ministry of security [of the Dniester republic] which had been 
broadcast by Radio Tiraspol, Radio Moldova announced that the 
targets of the terrorist attack were the prosecutor of the 
self-proclaimed Dniester republic, Boris Luchik, his wife, and 
two of his bodyguards. 
  According to unofficial information, one of the bodyguards 
died, while the health of Luchik's wife is critical. 
  After first describing the explosion as a terrorist act 
intended to destabilize the political situation in the Dniester 
region, the communique released today by the ministry of 
security asserts that Luchik had received repeated anonymous 
telephone threats. According to the same sources, the 
prosecutor of the self-proclaimed Dniester republic has 
initiated criminal proceedings against Col. Bergman [General 
Mikhail Bergman, chief of staff of the Dniester separatist 
forces] and now the latter seems to be trying to settle accounts 
with Luchik.
