FT  12 NOV 94 / National Theatre says it faces loss
The National Theatre said yesterday it might make a loss this year after a
surplus of Pounds 539,000 on a turnover of Pounds 28.3m in 1993-94, Antony
Thorncroft writes.
The Royal Shakespeare Company, the UK's other leading publicly funded
theatre company, reported a surplus of almost Pounds 1.4m last year on a
Pounds 27.4m turnover.
The hot summer and the failure of some new productions hit box office income
at the National Theatre. But it hopes to keep any deficit below Pounds
500,000.
The National Theatre has been successful in controlling costs in recent
years, and has accumulated a reserve of Pounds 927,000. The RSC still has a
deficit of more than Pounds 1m but for the third successive year has managed
to cut it.
Both companies are suffering from the freeze in government subsidy, which is
more than 40 per cent of their incomes.
Baroness Detta O'Cathain, managing director of the Barbican Centre, is
taking paid leave of absence, the Corporation of London said yesterday.
