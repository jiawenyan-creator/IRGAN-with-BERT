FT  25 NOV 93 / US factory orders up in October
Reports of a sharp rise in factory orders yesterday provided further
confirmation that the pace of US economic growth is accelerating.
The Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods rose 2 per cent
last month and 8.7 per cent in the year to October. This was broadly in line
with analysts' projections and followed reports of a big rise in the
Purchasing Managers' Index.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, noted that orders rose in eight out of 10
leading industrial sectors, indicating the recovery in manufacturing was
broadly based. Increases in orders for capital goods indicated the economy's
productive capacity was rising in line with higher consumer demand.
The rise in orders occurred in spite of an 11.6 per cent fall in defence
orders last month, reflecting continuing budget retrenchment at the
Pentagon.
Much of the strength in the civilian economy was concentrated in the
volatile transport sector, where orders rose 5.5 per cent between September
and October. Aircraft orders rose an erratic 48 per cent.
However, excluding both defence and transport, orders rose a respectable 2
per cent last month - a sign that recent falls in long-term interest rates
have increased demand for durable goods.
Orders for non-defence capital goods, excluding aircraft - seen as a guide
to civilian investment trends - rose 1.5 per cent in October, the eighth
increase in nine months.
Many forecasters are predicting growth at an annual rate of 4 per cent or
higher in the current quarter. But the growth rate is widely expected to
moderate early next year because consumer spending has run ahead of personal
incomes.
