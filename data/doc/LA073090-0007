'IF I DON'T GET OUT . . . '; 
BRITAIN NEEDS ANSWERS FOR 3.25 MILLION SUBJECTS IN HONG KONG 
"If I don't get out of Hong Kong by 1997, I'm finished, I know it." The quiet 
desperation in Li Qiang's words reflects the growing anxiety of millions of 
Hong Kong residents. 
They, like the 42-year-old laborer, are consumed with fear and uncertainty 
about what will happen when the British return Hong Kong to China seven years 
from now. 
Li Qiang and about 45,000 others flocked to the Hong Kong Immigration 
Department last week on the final day to apply for a special program that will 
give full British citizenship to 50,000 families, about 225,000 persons, who 
will be allowed to emigrate to Britain. 
The British Nationality Act is woefully inadequate and unfair. Only 4% of Hong 
Kong's 5.8 million residents are eligible to emigrate, although 3.25 million 
already hold restricted British nationality documents. 
That's not very generous for a nation that has enjoyed the fruits of Hong Kong 
since 1898. Britain is simply not fulfilling its moral obligation to Hong Kong. 
The British maintain that the emigration program was designed to favor those 
skilled, educated and entrepreneurial individuals who are critical to Hong 
Kong's continued prosperity. 
They need the assurance of full British citizenship so they can continue to 
work in Hong Kong while keeping the option to leave in 1997, when Britain's 
99-year lease ends. 
In 1984, China promised to maintain Hong Kong's freewheeling economic and 
social system under a program called "one country, two systems." But the people 
of Hong Kong lost confidence after pro-democracy demonstrations in China were 
crushed in June, 1989. Since then, more than 1,000 residents a week have left. 
Britain alone can't absorb the 3.25 million Hong Kong residents who already 
have papers. But it has used the entrepreneurial flair and capital of Hong 
Kong. In return it should expand the emigration program.
