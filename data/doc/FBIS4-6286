  [Text] Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, commented on his talks with U.S. Trade Representative 
(USTR) Mickey Kantor in Morocco last week at a news conference 
on 18 April. He said, "There were certain misunderstandings 
between us, but we have deepened our understanding (through the 
talks)." He stressed that the talks resolved misunderstandings 
and were beneficial. 
  With regard to the Japanese and U.S. positions on "objective 
criteria," which constituted the greatest point of disagreement 
at the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks, Hata said, "We 
have come to understand fully what the other side thinks." He 
further stated that he has come to understand that the United 
States is not obsessed with the so-called "numerical targets" -- 
such as market shares.
