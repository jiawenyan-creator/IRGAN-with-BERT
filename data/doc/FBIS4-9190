  [Excerpts] [Begin recording] [Colo] [words indistinct] 
This is best proven by the information that was this afternoon 
forwarded to us by Esad Ohranovic, president of the Executive 
Council of the Gorazde District: 
  [Ohranovic] We have over 100 dead today. Nothing is known 
any longer. We are constantly counting. Nobody knows anything 
here any longer. [passage omitted] Today, we had more than 20 
children killed. Is there anyone to stop this? 
  [Colo] In several localities within the town, whole groups 
of people were killed by the chetnik grenades. One massacre 
also occurred in the direct vicinity of the hospital: 
  [Ohranovic] The hospital is small and a great number of 
patients are lying outside it, whom we cannot admit [word 
indistinct] in the hospital, even though the hospital is not 
safe either. We have been forced to accommodate patients in the 
nearby [words indistinct]. This place, that is to say, 
accommodation, was attacked with various arms, from tanks and 
guns, on several occasions today. First, tank grenades 
destroyed a protective wall around it and then shells started 
flying directly at this dispensary. There were 35 patients in 
the dispensary, and out of these 35 only 7 people were pulled 
out alive. Therefore, regarding all others, we do not know 
anything as everything is in ruins. However, we anticipate that 
28 have been killed. The people from the nearby buildings and 
shelters tried to approach this locality to pull out the 
survivors, however, they could not reach them as they were 
opening fire from antiaircraft machine guns, antiaircraft guns, 
snipers, and tanks, and nobody can get there. There is chaos, 
and only sporadic cries can be heard, which are probably their 
last cries. The entrance from where the people were coming to 
help this site was hit directly by a tank grenade and five 
people were killed there instantaneously. Two nurses were 
immediately killed, too. [passage omitted]
