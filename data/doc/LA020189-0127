ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
LAGUNA BEACH; 
CREW BREAKS SEWER LINE; BEACH SECTION CLOSED 
A construction crew rebuilding a Laguna Beach hotel accidentally broke a sewer 
line on Tuesday, causing thousands of gallons of raw sewage to flood into the 
ocean north of Main Beach. 
The north portion of Main Beach was closed after the 9:30 a.m. pipeline rupture 
and will remain closed for at least a day, City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said. 
Frank said the construction crew was working on the renovation of the Inn of 
Laguna on North Coast Highway when it hit the line. He said it took until about 
1 p.m. to stop the flow of sewage. 
The spill was considerably smaller than one last May on the same beach. Then, a 
1-mile stretch of shoreline from Main Beach to Cleo Street was closed for 2 
days after 1 million gallons of raw sewage spewed into the ocean when a pump 
station was knocked out by an electrical failure. That spill was one of the 
largest in county history.
