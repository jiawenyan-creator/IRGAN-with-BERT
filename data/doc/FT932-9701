FT  12 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
A LATE spate of active buying on the back of an improved Wall Street was the
only feature in an otherwise dull day in the derivatives market, writes Joel
Kibazo.
In futures, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index opened strongly at
2,843, a 15-point premium to the underlying cash market.
However, this early strength soon fizzled out, leaving the contract to drift
lower. It traded in a 10-point range between 2,830 and 2,840 for the next
few hours.
Further selling during the afternoon saw June fall below the morning's
trading range and it reached the day's low of 2,823 at around 3.15pm.
It was the buying spree that followed the recovery of Wall Street that
brought about an upturn in the June contract and it ended at 2,842, up 1
from its previous close and around 3 above its fair value premium to cash of
about 5. Turnover was 8,063 lots, although dealers suggested that a big
buyer today may boost turnover.
The traded options saw reduced volume of 26,243 contracts with the index
options once again the most active. Some 8,525 lots were dealt in the FT-SE
100 option and 4,818 in the Euro FT-SE. Glaxo was the busiest stock option
with a total of 1,409 trades, followed by BP at 1,083. British Airways was
also active.
Dealings will begin today in an additional seven stock options.
