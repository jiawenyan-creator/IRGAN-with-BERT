FT  01 OCT 92 / Romanian president warns of social and economic crisis
President Ion Iliescu warned yesterday that Romania faced an economic and
social crisis. He called on the country's divided political parties to form
a broad-based government of 'national reconciliation'. He said he was
prepared to accept any coalition which found consensus within the new
parliament following inconclusive results from Sunday's general election.
Mr Iliescu looks set for re-election in a presidential run-off on October
11.
