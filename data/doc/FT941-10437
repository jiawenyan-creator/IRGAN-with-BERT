FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Caterpillar in Russian joint
venture deal
Caterpillar, the world's biggest producer of construction equipment, is
forming a joint venture company to produce construction machinery components
in St Petersburg.
The venture, Nevamash, will be 65 per cent owned by Caterpillar, with the
remaining shares held by Kirovsky Zavod, a St Petersburg-based manufacturing
company. No other terms were disclosed.
The agreement comes after a year of expanded activity by Caterpillar in the
Commonwealth of Independent States, and the signing of three engine-related
joint ventures.
The latest deal, however, marks its first non-engine venture in the CIS.
