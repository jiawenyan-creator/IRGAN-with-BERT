  [Text] Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- A South Korean 
compatriot, Kim Chae-su, 34, came over to the North through a 
third country with his wife Min Chong-cha, 34, and his son Kim 
Un-chol, 11. 
  Born in Chunchon, South Korean Kangwon Province, he finished 
primary and middle schools and graduated from a high school 
before serving in the puppet Army for three years. 
  He worked at an aviation company and engaged in other jobs 
from 1981 and kept an aquatic products shop in his hometown 
before defecting to the North. 
  Now his parents and brothers live in South Korea. 
  Explaining the motive of his defection, Kim Chae-su said he 
learned through various channels that the people in the North 
were equally well off under a good policy centered on the 
masses. "Hearing this, I was disillusioned about the South 
Korean society where fraud, swindle and irregularities hold sway 
and I did not want to live there any longer." 
  "Clearly learning that the anti-communist propaganda of the 
South Korean authorities was all a lie, I firmly resolved to 
come to the North where the people live a worthy life," he said, 
and added: "I came over here while I was on a foreign trip with 
my family under the disguise of tourism."
