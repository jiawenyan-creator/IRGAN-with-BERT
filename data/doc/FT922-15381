FT  01 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Speyhawk falls to earth
Speyhawk's warning that shareholders should not expect a dividend 'for some
time' looks like the understatement of the year. No doubt unintentionally,
it brings to mind the final words of Captain Oates as he headed off into a
snowstorm in the Antarctic - and remember what happened to him. Admittedly,
if all goes according to plan, the bank restructuring transforms Pounds 70m
of negative net worth into a modest net asset position - so the company is
not technically bust. But with a market capitalisation shrunk to only Pounds
500,000, the shares are for long-term contrarians only.
Investors will be more interested in the knock-on effects on a sector whose
frailty is reflected by the fact that 20 per cent of property companies
listed in the back of this newspaper are now penny stocks. A few, like
Sheraton, have disappeared, but yesterday's events confirm the impression
already gained through Rosehaugh, London and Metropolitan, Heron and Olympia
&amp; York of bankers deeply reluctant to pull the plug. The market is already
aware of the scale of unwanted office accommodation in the City, but another
company with banks in the driving seat can only further dent confidence and
delay a recovery.
Speyhawk's write-down vividly demonstrates the particular vulnerability of
the once high-flying trader/developers, whose assets are the difference
between the potential cost of their sites and the potential value of selling
them. Roughly half Speyhawk's portfolio is still unlet, which makes for
especially devastating valuations in current conditions. Even so,
shareholders are entitled to ask what assumptions were made when the balance
sheet was drawn up a year ago.
Notwithstanding the efforts by the chairman, Mr Trevor Osborne, and
colleagues to cut overheads, and the lack of alternative options for the
lenders, they are also entitled to ponder the justice of management keeping
their jobs.
