FT  07 JUL 92 / Letter: British view of German rethink on EFA fighter
'idiosyncratic'
Sir, I refer to your leader 'Credibility test for Bonn' (June 2).
Sometimes the British are a funny lot. When Harold Wilson, the former UK
prime minister, negated Edward Heath's signature under the agreement of
entry into the EC, he was hailed as a great politician. When Margaret
Thatcher - swinging her handbag and screaming 'I want my money back' -
negated Wilson's signature under the revised entry treaty, it was three
cheers for the Iron Lady. Opting out of two essential parts of the
Maastricht accord is considered a political success for John Major in
defending British sovereignty (the latter, only possible with the pivotal
assistance of Helmut Kohl).
Now the Germans have decided to opt out of the production phase of the EFA
project, an option covered in the existing contractual agreement. What is
that for the FT (and for the British defence minister)? It is a test of
Bonn's credibility 'as a reliable partner of the west'. Ha]
The Germans give military (drastically changed environment) and political
reasons for their change of mind. The latter, particularly, reflects a
considerable change of the electorate's mood. In a democracy that is
important - see Denmark and Maastricht.
Of course, if, as you say, the German 'nein turns out to be definite', it
will have political consequences, as had Wilson and Thatcher's requests for
renegotiation and Major's opt-out. But that is the purpose of the exercise.
When the British do it, for their reasons, it is fine; but when others do
it, for their own reasons, it casts doubts on their credibility. That seems,
with respect, a rather idiosyncratic British pragmatism or sense of reality.
