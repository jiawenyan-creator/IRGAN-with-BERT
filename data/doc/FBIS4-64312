Neutral Partners of NATO"] 
  [Excerpt] Brussels, 29 Apr (ATS) -- Sweden and Finland will 
sign the framework agreement on the Partnership for Peace on 9 
May, NATO sources have announced today. They will be the first 
two neutral countries to do so. 
  Switzerland also is interested in the offer made by NATO 
last 
January to all CSCE members for cooperation. However, the 
Federal Council probably will wait until the results of the 
referendum on the blue helmets are released before it makes its 
intentions known. Indeed, the peacekeeping operations fall 
within the scope of activities under the Partnership program.
