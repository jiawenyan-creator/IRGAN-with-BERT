  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres today said that the 
evacuation of Jewish settlements in the territories would be 
implemented solely as an internal Israeli decision and not as 
part of the negotiations with the PLO. Peres added that due to 
the delay in the negotiations, the withdrawal from the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho could not be expected to take place on 13 
April as planned. Our correspondent Yiftah El'azar reports. 
  [Begin recording] [El'azar] Estonian President Lennart Meri 
and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres were holding hands when they 
left the ceremony in which they signed joint economic 
agreements. Peres, however, let go of his guest's hand and, as 
always, commented on the future of the political process. 
  [Peres] We must constantly find ways to reach agreement and 
I hope that we will be successful. 
  [El'azar] A little time, not much, is all Peres is asking 
for. His message for the PLO was that one cannot constantly put 
off the resumption of the negotiations and still expect the 
Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip to take place on 13 
April. In the same breath, Peres explained that any expectation 
of Israel evacuating settlements is unfounded. 
  [Peres] The issue of whether settlements have to be moved or 
not is an Israeli decision, but not part of the negotiations 
with the Palestinians. 
  [El'azar] Peres also commented on the Clinton-Rabin summit 
scheduled for later this week. There is no need to divert the 
focus to the Syrian track, he explained, because Israel is 
prepared to make progress on all three tracks. The foreign 
minister then moved on to discuss Prime Minister Rabin's 
impending meeting with the Pope. 
  [Peres] We have just established relations after 2,000 
years. We now have to discuss the next 2,000 years. 
  [El'azer] Addressing the more mundane aspects of the peace 
negotiations, the Foreign Ministry said that the Israeli 
Government would discuss its next steps after being briefed on 
the results of today's meetings in Tunis. [end recording]
