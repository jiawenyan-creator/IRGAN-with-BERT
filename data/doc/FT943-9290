FT  12 AUG 94 / Haiti military leaders offered 'last chance'
Several Latin American governments are to send a mission to Haiti in an
attempt to persuade the country's military leaders to step down and prevent
a US-led military invasion to restore the exiled president, diplomats in
Port-au-Prince said yesterday, writes Canute James in Kingston.
The move will come 'in a few days' despite earlier doubts about its
effectiveness.
The mission, which had seemed unlikely last week, would offer Haiti's
military governors a 'last chance to save themselves', by leaving office. If
they did not, several countries which were now reluctant to support military
intervention might change their minds, the envoys said.
