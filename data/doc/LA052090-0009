CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: FASHION; 
PANAMA INVASION 
AS SUMMER APPROACHES and sun block sales soar, the thought of wearing a Panama 
hat becomes appealing. 
These hats, the finest of which are hand-blocked, actually come from Ecuador 
(Spanish for equator), where the sun burns hot. The classic cover-ups (which 
sell for about $30) are available in the downtown L.A. garment district's New 
York Hat Store in six styles and seven sizes, in natural and bleach tints. If 
only the downtown neighborhood were as nice as the hats. 
 New York Hat Store, 522 S. Main St., Los Angeles; (213) 623-2650. JOAN DRAPER
