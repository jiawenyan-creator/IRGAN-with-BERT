FT  31 AUG 93 / Currency dealers lent some support
DISTINGUISHED economists leapt to the defence of much-maligned currency
speculators at the meeting.
Sir Samuel Brittan, principal economic commentator of the Financial Times
and this year's president of the association's economics section, said:
'George Soros did a certain amount of good and people shouldn't condemn him
as an evil speculator.' Mr Soros is the US-based financier who was said to
have made Dollars 1bn at the time of sterling's exit from the European
exchange rate mechanism last year.
Sir Samuel quoted Milton Friedman's 'beautifully simple theory that either
speculators exercised a stabilising influence, or they lost money and
damaged themselves'.
Professor Amartya Sen of Harvard University agreed with Sir Samuel about the
benign effect of speculators. But his main theme was that 'codes of
behaviour' have been central to the achievements of capitalism.
'Capitalism has made it possible to raise productivity by teamwork, by
co-ordination and co-operation, and ultimately by trust in each other's
behaviour in economic and business relationships,' Prof Sen said.
Mr John Flemming, chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, said that in the former Soviet Union: 'Mafia capitalism is
better than no capitalism at all.'
Mr Flemming said that, in their journey from a very heavily regulated state
to the moderate regulation typical of western Europe, 'the formerly
centrally planned economies should probably plan to move temporarily further
in the direction of deregulation than may be the long-run goal.
'The reason for this is that the human and moral capital required for the
institutions to run even a moderate regulatory regime is not readily
available.'
