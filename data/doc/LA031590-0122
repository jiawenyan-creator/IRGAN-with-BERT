EXECUTION TIME CHANGED TO AVOID TRAFFIC JAM 
San Quentin prison officials, trying to maintain good relations with Marin 
County residents and avoid commuter gridlock, have set 3 a.m. as the time to 
carry out California's first scheduled execution in 23 years. 
California traditionally carried out executions at 10 a.m. But authorities 
believe that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of demonstrators will show up for the 
scheduled April 3 execution of convicted killer Robert Alton Harris. 
So they have rescheduled the execution for seven hours earlier. 
Christine May, California Department of Corrections spokeswoman, said the 
primary reason for the change was a desire to limit the potential impact on 
Marin County commuters and the enclave of San Quentin, a residential area of 
condominiums and older homes outside the main gates of the prison. 
"There was some concern about the impact of a large gathering of individuals, 
both media and private citizens," on the commuters and the San Quentin 
neighborhood, May said. 
San Quentin prison Warden Daniel Vasquez made the decision to move the 
execution back to 3 a.m. after visiting other states that conduct executions in 
early morning. Officer Mark Pieschke of the Marin County office of the 
California Highway Patrol said the CHP "wholeheartedly supports" the change in 
the execution time. 
Ever since the Oct. 17 Northern California earthquake, traffic has "drastically 
increased" on the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, which crosses San Francisco Bay 
near the prison. Large numbers of commuters began using the bridge when the San 
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge was closed for repairs, and many continue to use 
the route. 
Pieschke speculated that on the morning of the execution, some commuters would 
have strained to see the protesters, and "we would have had traffic backed up 
all the way" into the east side of San Francisco Bay.
