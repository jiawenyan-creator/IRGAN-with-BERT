FT  11 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Kuwait aims to open up free trade zone
KUWAIT has begun a feasibility study into opening up a free trade zone, Mr
Abdul Rahman Nibari, head of the emirate's Port Authority, said yesterday,
Our Middle East Staff reports. Mr Nibari said Kuwait had chosen one out of
10 consultancy groups from the US, Britain, France and the Netherlands which
had offered to carry out the project, though he would not name the company.
Kuwait hopes to develop entrepot trade with Iran to compensate for loss of
trans-shipment trade it enjoyed with Iraq before the Gulf war. 'The free
zone will help activate the national economy and commercial business, and
bring the latest technology,' Mr Nibari told the Kuwaiti News Agency KUNA.
The study on a free zone, to compete with Dubai's Jebel Ali port, which
already carries a large amount of entrepot trade with Iran, will take eight
months to complete. Shuwaikh Port, Kuwait's biggest sea inlet, would have to
be expanded before the zone was set up. Kuwait had been toying with the idea
of a free zone before Iraq's 1990 invasion, to revive its role as a major
re-export centre in the Gulf.
