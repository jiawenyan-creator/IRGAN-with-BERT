LOOKING AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WOMEN AND HOLLYWOOD; 
WHAT ABOUT THE STATUS OF BLACK ACTRESSES? 
Isn't it curious that Dutka's article could protest the trivialization of 
(white) actresses while omitting any mention of the fact that black and other 
minority women get hardly any roles at all, minor or otherwise? What black 
actress other than Whoopi Goldberg is working on a regular basis? I care a lot 
more about this than whether Streep gets paid as much as Nicholson.
