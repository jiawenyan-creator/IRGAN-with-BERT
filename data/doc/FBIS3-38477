<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Gonzalez Says That There Is Clear </F>
Desire for Renewal in PSOE"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez 
expressed Wednesday [26 January] his satisfaction at the outcome 
of the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] provincial 
congresses which have been held, since they express a "clear 
desire" for renewal and integration. 
  At a joint press conference with Finnish Prime Minister Esko 
Aho at the Moncloa Palace, the PSOE leader described as positive 
the outcome of those congresses, at which the delegates to the 
March federal summit were elected and at which the sum total of 
renewalists and integrationists defeated the Guerraists.

  "The congresses clearly express the party's majority wishes; 
this is unequivocal," and represents "a clear desire for 
renewal, integration, and cohesion," said Gonzalez, who declared 
himself "satisfied" with the results. 
  "Renewal and integration are what was put across at the 
provincial congresses," the prime minister stated, emphasizing 
that this lies "within the message which I have tried to convey 
with all due respect to the party, whose say it is right now."
