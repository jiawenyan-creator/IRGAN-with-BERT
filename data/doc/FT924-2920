FT  10 DEC 92 / Letter: SEC judgment not a ban
Sir, Your headline writer is a lot harsher on me than was the US Securities
and Exchange Commission (International Company News: 'SEC bans Gutfreund for
life over bond auctions', December 4).
Unfortunately, some people only read the headlines and may think I am
'barred for life'. In fact, I was neither barred nor suspended. I told the
SEC that I have no intention of again being a chief executive officer of a
securities firm and undertook not to do so without applying.
After all these months under a cloud, I welcome the SEC's judgment that I
was not involved in any way in the misconduct. Because I was Salomon's CEO
at the time, I was willing to accept the consequences of any mistakes.
I am satisfied that the record now is clear that Salomon Brothers is and was
an honourable firm.
