SCHOOL NEWS: TWINS RAISE FUNDS FOR 'AMBASSADORIAL' TRIP 
Joann and Talolo Lepale, 16-year-old twins selected to tour Europe and Moscow 
as part of the People to People High School Ambassador Program, have raised the 
$8,000 needed for their summer trip, just making their May 10 deadline. 
The twins have spent the last four months raising money for the 31-day trip, 
said their mother, Yonneta Lepale. 
They collected cans and newspapers, held a carwash and a yard sale. They also 
sent out 110 letters to clubs and organizations in the San Gabriel Valley 
asking for donations. 
Pledges came in from neighbors, local doctors, pharmacists, shop owners, and 
their friends and co-workers. The largest donation came from the American 
Legion. 
The Lepale twins, juniors at Bassett High School, were selected on the basis of 
their academic achievement, community involvement and recommendations from 
teachers and counselors. The People to People program is a nonprofit 
organization founded during the Dwight D. Eisenhower Administration to 
encourage international student exchange.
