STEALTH BOMBER CONTROVERSY 
The Times has shown a lowly bias against the Stealth bomber. Conrad's cartoon 
on July 21 is the latest case in point. The cartoon degrades the superb 
technological achievement of the B-2 by comparing it with the hokey Batman. 
The text of Conrad's cartoon slammed the cost of the B-2. 
Why does The Times insist on showing the B-2 expense as a negative? Surely The 
Times knows that most of this expense will provide income for thousands of its 
readers. 
One would think if The Times feels it has to take a biased position it would be 
in favor of building the B-2 according to the original production plan, if not 
because the B-2 will provide a powerful defensive weapon then because it will 
assure the continued flow of aerospace/defense dollars to the benefit of 
Southern California citizens.
