ON THE SIDELINES; 
EDWARDS' BATTERY TRIAL PUT OFF AGAIN 
The battery trial of former Indiana University basketball star Jay Edwards, who 
was drafted in June by the Los Angeles Clippers, was postponed again today. 
Monroe Superior Court Judge Kenneth G. Todd granted the motion for continuance 
filed this morning by Edwards' attorney, Viola J. Taliaferro. A new trial date 
of Sept. 21 was set. 
Edwards, who has pleaded innocent to two misdemeanor battery charges, is 
accused of slapping an Indianapolis woman during a party in April at a 
Bloomington apartment. Edwards, a former All-American who left IU last spring 
to enter the NBA draft, claims that the woman, Beth Ann Irish, lunged at him 
during a confrontation at the party. 
Monroe County Prosecutor Robert Miller said today that a plea agreement had 
been offered, but he declined to divulge the contents of the offer. 
A bench trial was originally scheduled for Edwards on May 30 but was continued 
to July 10, then to today.
