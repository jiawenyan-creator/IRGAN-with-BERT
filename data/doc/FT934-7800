FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Creditors approve scheme of arrangement for
Kwelm
CREDITORS yesterday approved proposals for a scheme of arrangement under
English insolvency law for the Kwelm insurance companies by a significant
margin, paving the way for an exit from provisional liquidation at the end
of the year.
Mr Chris Hughes, head of insolvency at Coopers &amp; Lybrand and one of the
provisional liquidators, said creditors had voted 'overwhelmingly in favour'
by both number and value of claims at a meeting in Alexandra Palace in
London.
An estimated 200 creditors turned up to vote, and by Monday evening this
week Mr Hughes had already collected proxies in favour from creditors owed
Dollars 3.1bn (Pounds 2.08bn). Those against were valued at Dollars 25m.
Total creditors' claims are estimated at above Dollars 6bn, and the schemes
must be approved by three quarters of creditors by value.
The approval for an exit into a scheme of arrangement will require
ratification by the High Court in London on December 8, followed by similar
approvals in Bermuda and then in the New York courts on December 14.
Mr Hughes said he hoped to be able to offer a first dividend to creditors by
the end of June next year, estimated at between 3 per cent and 12 per cent
for the different companies.
All the Kwelm companies are subsidiaries of London United Investments, the
insurer now in administration. They are Kingscroft, Walbrook, Lime Street
and Mutual Re.
