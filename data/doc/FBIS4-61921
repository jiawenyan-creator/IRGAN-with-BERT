  [Text] A government commission led by Russian Vice-Premier 
Aleksandr Shokhin was formed in Russia for talks on economic 
cooperation and trade with Crimea. This was said in Simferopol 
on Tuesday at a session of the Crimean parliament by Chairman of 
the Russian state Duma Committee for CIS Konstantin Zatulin. In 
his words, in the near future "a Crimean-Russian 
interparliamentary group" is also expected to be formed. 
  Zatulin pointed out that "today there is a possibility to 
start a new history of Crimea." At the same time, he urged 
Crimean parliamentarians "to be more contained and to take 
balanced decisions needed for the prosperity of the Crimean 
Republic."
