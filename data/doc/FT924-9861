FT  04 NOV 92 / Court told of worry on Plasser methods
A FORMER secretary with Plasser Railway Machinery GB said at the Old Bailey
yesterday she thought business methods used by the company 'sailed close to
the wind' and could have amounted to corruption.
Mrs Stella Bond, secretary to Mr Norbert Jurasek, the company's managing
director, and Mr Michael Brooks, its company secretary, said her training as
a policewoman made her concerned about Plasser's methods.
When Mrs Bond expressed her concerns, though, she was assured it was
'perfectly all right'.
Plasser GB, Mr Jurasek and Mr Brooks all deny giving bribes to Mr David
Currie, a former British Rail head of civil engineering. Mr Currie denies
receiving bribes.
When Sir Robert Reid, a former BR chairman, visited Plasser's Austrian works
during a recent holiday the company imposed hospitality upon him, Mrs Bond
told the court.
Sir Robert was known as 'not being 100 per cent a Plasser man' and had told
the company he wanted to be on his own.
'I think it was felt as he was going to be in that part of the world Plasser
would cash in and give him some hospitality,' she said.
The trial continues today.
