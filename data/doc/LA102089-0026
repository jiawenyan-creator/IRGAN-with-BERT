15 RIGHTS ACTIVISTS DETAINED IN PRAGUE 
Czechoslovak police detained 15 human rights activists, including former 
Foreign Minister Jiri Hajek and an American member of the International 
Helsinki Federation, dissidents said. Olga Havlova, wife of dissident 
playwright Vaclav Havel, said they were detained when they arrived for a 
meeting at a restaurant in Prague, the capital, with a delegation from the 
Vienna-based federation, which monitors human rights violations. Jeri Laber, a 
member of U.S. Helsinki Watch, was also detained after taking photographs of 
police but was released shortly afterward, dissident Anna Sabatova said. The 
others were freed by nightfall, an emigre source said.
