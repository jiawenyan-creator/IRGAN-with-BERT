FT  08 JAN 92 / Marcos to run for presidency
MRS Imelda Marcos, the former Philippines first lady said yesterday she
wants to run for president in Philippine elections scheduled for May, Reuter
reports from Manila.
Minutes after pleading not guilty on corruption charges in a Manila court,
Mrs Marcos said she hoped to secure the nomination of one of the opposition
parties as its candidate to contest the May polls.
'After months of direct consultation with our poor and oppressed citizens, I
have decided to run for office to seek the presidency by submitting to the
democratic process of a national convention,' she told reporters.
Mrs Marcos and the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos were hounded from the
Philippines in a popular revolt in 1986, accused of looting billions of
dollars from the country. The 62-year-old widow returned to an enthusiastic
welcome from supporters last November after almost six years of exile in the
US.
She accused President Corazon Aquino, the woman who ousted her, of running
'a sick and misdirected government'.
It was the first time Mrs Marcos had announced plans to run for the
presidency, although she has been gradually edging towards such a move since
returning from exile.
She said she hoped to forge a united opposition coalition for the May polls
and wanted a national convention to select the opposition candidate.
Mrs Aquino has said she will not run in the elections, scheduled for May 11.
Some political commentators believe she may change her mind if Mrs Marcos
runs.
The filing of criminal charges is part of a government bid to recover more
than Dollars 350m (Pounds 192m) it says the Marcoses had deposited in secret
Swiss bank accounts.
