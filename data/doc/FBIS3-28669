  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Shinseito co-leader Ichiro 
Ozawa said Tuesday [8 February] he thinks by intuition that 
North Korea has already developed nuclear weapons. Ozawa told a 
press conference that "it is impossible to explain" the basis 
for his belief that the country is developing nuclear weapons 
because "I have not seen it with my own eyes, but I believe so, 
that's my hunch." 
  Ozawa, one of the main strategists of the coalition 
government, told a television interview Sunday that North Korea 
"definitely has nuclear arms," without giving any evidence to 
back up his statement. He reasoned that if the country did not 
have any nuclear weapons, it would open its facilities to 
inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
Ozawa said that if it has nothing to hide, it "should show 
everything." 
  The pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongryun) demanded that Ozawa withdraw his remarks, 
saying "they are preposterous and defiant" and that they "ignore 
elementary diplomatic common sense."
