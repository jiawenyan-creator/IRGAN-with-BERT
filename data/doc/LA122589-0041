PARAMEDICS, POLICE ATTACKED WITH BOTTLES, ROCKS AS THEY INVESTIGATE SHOOTING 
DEATH 
Paramedics and police were showered with rocks and bottles early Sunday when 
they tried to investigate the shooting death of a 25-year-old man in a 
South-Central Los Angeles public housing project, authorities said. 
Los Angeles Police Detective Bernie Skiles said that although the victim, 
Steven Renell Williams, 25, did not live in the Pueblo Del Rio Housing Project 
on Long Beach Avenue, "he was quite well known and popular there and when we 
tried to preserve the crime scene to assist in finding out who did it, a crowd 
of about 50, both men and women started pitching the rocks and bottles." 
Three men were arrested on suspicion of a deadly weapon assault on a peace 
officer. 
Policewoman Marvina Herman and Officer Timothy Crass were treated at the scene 
for injuries caused by rocks and returned to work. 
Skiles said "it is too early to tell if (Williams' death) involved gang 
warfare."
