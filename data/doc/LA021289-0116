THE STATE 
A Greyhound bus was destroyed by fire on U.S. 101 in the Atascadero area, but 
all 18 passengers and the driver escaped uninjured, the California Highway 
Patrol said. Officers said the driver, Joanne Huggins, 36, stopped the bus when 
a light indicated dangerously low pressure in the braking system. About 10 
minutes later, the rear tires blew and the bus caught fire. The officers said 
Huggins evacuated the bus before the flames engulfed the vehicle. The cause of 
the fire was not immediately determined.
