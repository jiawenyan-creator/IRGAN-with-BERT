<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The New Chief Is Also a Builder, But </F>
Can He Communicate With the Press?"] 
  [Text] According to information obtained from Petropavlovsk 
and Aktyubinsk journalists (where Z. Nurkadilov's successor, 
Shalbay Kulmakhanov, was chairman of the oblast soviet executive 
committee and chief of the oblast administration), our new mayor 
likes to meet the press. And not only employees of municipal 
television, what is more. And he is altogether more open and 
democratic than the severe Zamanbek Kalabayevich. 
  It is troubling, though, that the new chief, like the old 
one, is a builder by education and service record. This is a 
wonderful and the most peaceful profession on earth, but the 
coincidence is still disturbing. Especially since with a 
diplomatic evasiveness typical, most likely, of all 
builder-mayors, Sh. Kulmakhanov successfully turned down the 
offer an interview with this issue of KARAVAN-BLITS.
