FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Tobacco machinery boost takes Molins to
Pounds 8m
MOLINS, the precision engineering group, lifted pre-tax profits for the
first half of 1993 by 14 per cent on the back of good sales of new tobacco
machinery.
The surplus reached Pounds 8m, compared with a restated Pounds 7m
previously. Turnover was ahead 16 per cent at Pounds 85.2m, compared with
Pounds 73.5m last time.
Mr Michael Orr, chairman, said that while margins were under pressure in the
two main divisions, order books were satisfactory, and the company was
better placed now than at this time last year.
The tobacco machinery's original equipment side had benefited from strong
Chinese demand and increased efficiency. In addition, there had been a
modest benefit from sterling's devaluation.
However, on the service side, while margins had been maintained, volumes had
fallen because of the cigarette price war in the US and lower demand from
Brazil. The latest figure includes a net pension credit of Pounds 1.8m.
Operating profits in the tobacco machinery division were Pounds 8.4m (Pounds
8m) on turnover of Pounds 52.2m (Pounds 48m).
Total operating profits were Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 8.5m), including a net
pension credit of Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.7m).
Earlier this month the group received Pounds 11.8m after tax from a surplus
in the pension scheme, which will be used to reduce borrowings.
The group said the repayment would have no material effect on earnings in
the second half.
The packaging machinery business, which is based mainly in North America,
reported operating profits down to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 700,000) on
turnover 33 per cent up at Pounds 32.6m from a previous Pounds 24.4m.
Net borrowings fell to Pounds 18.4m at the end of the period compared with a
previous Pounds 24.4m, giving gearing of 12.6 per cent against 18.5 per
cent.
Earnings per share rose from 17.4p to 20.1p . The interim dividend is
increased to 4.9p (4.5p).
