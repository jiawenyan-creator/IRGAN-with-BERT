  [Text] The Council of State of the LNTG [Liberia National 
Transitional Government] has called on the warring factions to 
immediately cease all hostilities and in all the country and 
dismantle all positions formerly held by them. 
  In a radio broadcast, the chairman of the council, His 
Excellency David Kpomakpor, called for the immediate encampment 
of all fighters for the subsequent disarmament by ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group]. The council says it finds it difficult to understand 
that while discussions about deployment of ECOMOG and 
disarmament are under way, some people are still fighting for 
territorial control. He called on Alhaji Koromah, Mr. Roosevelt 
Johnson, Dr. (George Buley), Mr. Charles Taylor, and others to 
stop the hostilities and urge their fighters to disarm. The 
council called on ECOMOG to begin effective deployment 
throughout the country and to take control of all entry points 
into the country and disarm all fighters according to the 
mandate given them by the Cotonou Accord.
