ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; 
CHURCH GETS BREAK ON DAY-CARE WALL 
The city Planning Commission voted to give a child-care program at Lutheran 
Church of the Master a six-month reprieve from a requirement that it build a 
block wall to protect neighbors. 
The commission voted Monday to allow a trial period to determine whether a 
chain-link fence would provide adequate security and privacy for neighbors of 
the church at 1601 W. La Habra Blvd. 
The commission had previously ordered the church to build a 6-foot-high block 
wall. 
"We're a nonprofit corporation," said church spokesman Howard Koch. "We have a 
small congregation. We're just not in a position to afford a block wall." 
Day-care director Mary Ann Borders also told the commission there is a shortage 
of day care for preschoolers in the community. The day-care program began 
operating at the end of November and serves 27 children. 
Commissioners David Cheverton and Charles Taylor agreed. Taylor suggested that 
the center be allowed six months to prove its contention that the chain-link 
fence would provide adequate protection for the neighbors.
