FT  28 JAN 92 / Airbus crash prompts strike call by pilots
PILOTS at the French domestic airline Air Inter have called a 24-hour strike
for Thursday, accusing the government of jumping to conclusions about an
Airbus crash in eastern France which killed 87 people last week, Reuter
reports.
The USPNT pilots' union said the Transport Ministry had 'exonerated' the
ultra-modern Airbus A320 and, by implication, blamed the crash on pilot
error.
A preliminary report on the crash, the third involving an A320 since the
airliner entered service four years ago, is not due for a month.
The airliner is one of the fastest selling in the world.
