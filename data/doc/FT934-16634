FT  05 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Options surge gives LCE boost
THE LONDON Commodity Exchange experienced a 63 per cent jump in trading
volumes last month compared with a year ago, driven by record turnover in
cocoa futures and options and in coffee options.
The LCE said a total of 431,714 futures and options contracts were traded, a
rise of 27 per cent on August. Volume in the year to date is up nearly 25
per cent on the same period of 1992.
The exchange, which has been streamlining its operations to concentrate on
core contracts, said the number of futures contracts traded in cocoa, its
most popular commodity, had risen by 96 per cent to 249,195.
Cocoa options had soared by 557 per cent to 19,532 contracts and coffee
options were up 76 per cent at 27,014.
Total open interest in September - the number of contracts which had not
been liquidated - was 65 per cent higher than a year ago and 13 per cent up
on August.
The LCE also announced that 1,655 lots were traded on the first day of the
premium raw sugar futures contract launched last Friday. 'The support from
LCE members and the international sugar trade has been very good indeed,'
said Mr Robin Woodhead, chief executive. Interest was more subdued yesterday
with 700 lots traded by late afternoon.
The exchange's other contracts are in white sugar, potatoes, international
freight, wheat and barley.
