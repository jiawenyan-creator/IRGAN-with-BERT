FT  20 JAN 94 / World Trade News: US farmers seek curbs on Canadian wheat
US farmers are pressing the Clinton administration to impose emergency curbs
on the flood of cheap Canadian wheat imports now entering the US.
With many grain elevators bulging with Canadian wheat, US farmers have begun
to take action. In Montana recently, farmers blockaded delivery of Canadian
wheat to a grain elevator with parked trucks.
'We never had wheat coming across before the flawed free trade agreement
with Canada,' said a spokesman for the US Wheat Associates. 'You wouldn't
expect it to come across at cheaper than US prices.'
US and Canadian negotiators have been trying to reach an agreement on
disputes in five farm sectors: wheat, peanut butter, sugar and sugar
products, poultry and dairy. Mr Ralph Goodale, Canada's agriculture
minister, said it was possible that agreement could be reached this week.
Meanwhile, President Clinton has asked the US International Trade Commission
to investigate the wheat imports.
