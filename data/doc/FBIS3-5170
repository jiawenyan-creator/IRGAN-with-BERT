  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Foreign Secretary Roberto 
Romulo yesterday said that economic cooperation is the main item 
on the agenda of the Philippine-Vietnam consultations to be held 
in Manila on 10 March. Romulo said the panels will discuss "how 
the Philippines will be able to support Vietnam go into a 
free-market system from a centrally planned economy." 
  Romulo said the Philippines has a lot of agriculturists and 
economics professors and practitioners. Under a "trilateral 
cooperation" arrangement, they can provide expertise to 
developing countries funded by a developed country like Japan. 
Romulo said such an arrangement is already in effect in Cambodia 
where a number of Filipino agriculturists are helping Cambodians 
under a program funded by Japan. 
  Other areas where Filipinos could lend expertise are 
banking, 
business management, fishing, and ceramics manufacturing. 
Another area the Filipinos are good at is implementation of 
official development assistance, Romulo said. Romulo said 
Vietnam, with more than 70 million people, is a rich market for 
the Philippines once the purchasing power of its population goes 
up. [passage omitted] 
  The 10 March bilateral consultation precedes President 
Ramos' 
state visit to Vietnam tentatively scheduled on 28 to 31 March.
