<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by Rebelde </F>
journalist Roberto Cavada; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] As our listeners will recall, our colleague Jose 
Mejia recently interviewed OAS Secretary General Joao Baena 
Soares on this same newscast. On that occasion, Baena Soares 
confirmed to Mejia, and of course the millions of Exclusivo 
listeners, his proposal, before a special session of the OAS in 
Mexico, that Cuba's return to such an important continental 
forum be discussed. 
  In an exclusive [interview], Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina has given the Exclusivo newscast his opinion on this 
matter. 
  [Begin recording] [Robaina] There is a much more fundamental 
problem involved. We... [rephrases] I mean, we were expelled. It 
is up to those who expelled us to say whether or not they think 
the conditions exist. We have always had our own opinion on that 
expulsion, and about the cause that [word or words indistinct]. 
If the countries and the basic scene from which we were expelled 
consider that it is time for Cuba... [changes thought] but not 
because it has lost or gained any conditions, or credibility. 
(?If) that is not the (?cause), but rather because they think a 
country such as ours should not be absent from an institution of 
that type, an institution with such characteristics -- which is 
what we think -- it is not Cuba that is going to set up 
obstructions. 
  I am grateful for the pronouncement that has been made, and 
I 
think it is also part of the new space, the space that Cuba -- 
through its work, and through its truth, and through its virtues 
and defects -- has opened up for itself in the America to which 
we belong. 
  [Cavada] And how does Cuba feel about the proposal of 
Gaviria 
as president of the OAS? 
  [Robaina] I think that a country that is not in the OAS does 
not have the right to an opinion regarding who is the best or 
worst candidate. It seems to me that we are all at present 
looking at the possibilities; and President Gaviria is 
undoubtedly a person who is concluding a mandate, concluding a 
responsibility. He is a person with a history, a point of 
reference, and some results. I am absolutely convinced that the 
members of that institution will know how to evaluate who the 
best person for president is. [end recording] 
  Those were exclusive statements by Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina Gonzalez regardng opinions expressed over this 
same newscast by OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares having 
to do with his proposal that the return of Cuba to such an 
important continental forum be discussed. 
  This is Roberto Cavada wishing you a good evening, Cubans.
