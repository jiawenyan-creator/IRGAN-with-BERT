FT  01 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Vickers hint
Vickers made rapid progress after an uncertain start. Down to around 164p in
early trading, the shares subsequently began to move ahead on strong support
prompted by a positive circular published by Robert Fleming Securities. They
closed 5 higher at 172p.
Another bull story in Vickers was that the company may conclude a joint
venture with Germany's Daimler-Benz by the end of the year in the
development of new Rolls-Royce cars. Specialists said they expected Daimler
to buy a 20 per cent stake in Rolls-Royce Motor Cars for around Pounds 40m
to Pounds 50m and eventually lift the holding to 49 per cent.
