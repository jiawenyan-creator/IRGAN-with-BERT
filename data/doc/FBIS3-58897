  [Text] Bonn (DPA) - A Somali was shot dead by Bundeswehr 
soldiers last night as he tried to enter the fuel depot at the 
Bundeswehr base in Beledweyne. The Defense Ministry said in 
Bonn today that the incident occurred at 0200 local time. The 
German soldiers first fired several warning shots, which the 
Somali and his accomplice did not heed. 
  The Defense Ministry said in its account of the incident 
that 
the Somalis were observed by German guards using nightvision 
equipment. The soldiers fired warning shots in the direction of 
the Somalis when they triggered an alarm. The ministry said one 
of the Somalis was hit. A doctor immediately called to the 
scene was only able to confirm the man was dead. 
  The Defense Ministry said according to information so far 
available, the conduct of the German guards was in accordance 
with the "rules for the use of weapons by the German support 
unit in Somalia." Colonel Holger Kammerhoff, the unit 
commander, suspended all humanitarian operations in Beledweyne 
following the incident. The freeze will remain in force until 
the incident has been clarified with the Somali authorities and 
UN representatives, it was said.
