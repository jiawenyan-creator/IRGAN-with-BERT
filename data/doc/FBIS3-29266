  [Text] The 120 updated F-16 fighter aircraft South Korea 
is to introduce under the Korean Fighter Program (KFP) has no 
connection with the used F-16s the Pentagon is reportedly 
planning to sell to allied countries including South Korea, the 
Defense Ministry said yesterday. 
  Commenting on a WALL STREET JOURNAL report that the Pentagon 
is to export various used aircraft and warships to save defense 
costs, a ranking Defense Ministry official said that Seoul has 
at present no plan or intention to buy the used U.S. weaponry. 
  "Especially, the F-16s we are going to buy or co-produce 
under the KFP are the latest model and quite different from the 
old models involved in the report," said the official. 
  The JOURNAL reported in its Monday edition that the U.S. 
government is considering selling 400 F-16s at about $4.8 
billion, an amount that covers the whole KFP project. Also 
included on the sell-off list are C-130 transport aircraft made 
by Lockheed, Boeing KC-135 in-flight tankers, warships, armored 
vehicles and tankers, the JOURNAL said. 
  "The F-16 Fighting Falcons we are going to introduce belong 
to the block/50 category, the latest model which began to be 
manufactured only in 1991, and I hope our people will not 
confuse the F-16s under the KFP with those reportedly in the 
U.S. sell-off list," said the official. 
  Under the KFP to upgrade the Air Force, South Korea is to 
buy 
12 finished F-16s by April 1995, assemble 36 and produce 72 
others under license from Lockheed by 1999.
