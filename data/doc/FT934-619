FT  23 DEC 93 / International Bonds: Focus on Italy's new year offering
New issue activity was concentrated in the Euroyen sector yesterday as the
rest of the Eurobond market wound down for the Christmas break.
As a result, syndicate managers with time on their hands pondered the likely
terms of the Republic of Italy's forthcoming Y300bn offering, which is
expected to be the first big deal of 1994.
The current yield on Italy's outstanding 10-year Euroyen bonds, of 23 basis
points over yen Libor, provided the basis for the price talk in the market.
Some syndicate managers reported that price talk on a five-year maturity
centred around 30 basis points over yen Libor.
However, talk on a 10-year maturity was much more varied, ranging from yen
Libor plus 25 basis points to yen Libor plus 70 basis points. 'With no
guidance from the joint leads or from Italy, the market is taking numbers
out of the sky,' said one syndicate manager.
Most of yesterday's Euroyen offerings were the so-called 'high-premium,
high-coupon' bonds which have become fashionable in recent weeks.
Nikko, which has arranged most of these deals, said the issues were tailored
to satisfy demand from Japanese investment trusts wanting to shift away from
fixed-rate to floating-rate instruments.
However, other syndicate managers noted that the inherent capital loss on
the bonds also appealed to investors looking for ways to reduce their
capital gains tax bill.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the international rating agency, has placed its ratings
of Societe Centrale Union des Assurances de Paris (Scuap) and its related
entities on CreditWatch with negative implications. This follows the French
government's confirmation that Scuap is likely to be privatised in the first
half of 1994.
