FT  14 JUL 94 / US inflation pressure stays moderate
US inflationary pressures remain moderate, despite robust economic growth,
official figures indicated yesterday, writes Michael Prowse in Washington.
The consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent last month, and by 2.5 per cent
in the year to June, in line with Wall Street projections.
The 'core' consumer price index, which excludes the volatile food and energy
components, rose by 0.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively.
Economists at C J Lawrence, the New York broker, said inflation in the US
service sector, at 3.2 per cent in the year to June, had fallen to its
lowest in a decade. Inflation in the goods sector has edged up in recent
months, but is still at an annual rate of only 1.6 per cent.
Following reports on Tuesday of zero producer price inflation last month,
the figures were not seen as putting immediate pressure on the Federal
Reserve to tighten monetary policy.
Most analysts, however, expect the Fed to signal further interest rate
increases in coming months, as part of a longer-term strategy to prevent
rapid economic growth eventually putting strong upward pressure on
inflation.
