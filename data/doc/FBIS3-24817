  [Text] Cotonou, 1 Feb (AFP)--An AFP journalist observed 
that about 3,000 people gathered at the Cotonou Labor Exchange 
this morning in response to a call by six unions to protest 
against the social consequences of the CFA franc devaluation. 
  For nearly four hours, the demonstrators--many of whom were 
carrying placards bearing slogans hostile to the International 
Monetary Fund and the World Bank--listened to speeches by union 
leaders before dispersing calmly. 
  The various speakers reiterated their demand for a 
"substantial" increase in salary to offset the increase in 
prices of consumer goods sparked off by the devaluation. They 
also called for an increase of more than 300 percent in the 
statutory minimum wage. 
  This rally was due to have been held a week ago but was 
banned by the Beninese Government, which dispatched police to 
the Labor Exchange to prevent the demonstrators from meeting.
