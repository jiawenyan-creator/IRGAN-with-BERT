FT  05 DEC 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up - Israel
First International Bank of Israel has introduced an instrument that will
allow domestic investors to invest in the dollar-shekel continuous foreign
exchange market, agencies report.
Under current law, only importers, exporters, banks and foreigners can buy
foreign currency in Israel for investment.
The instrument was made possible by the liberalisation of the country's
currency markets on July 4, when the government introduced a continuous
trading system.
This system now accounts for 68 per cent of Israel's forex trading.
