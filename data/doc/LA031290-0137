THE SIDELINES; 
CANSECO HALTS ATTEMPTED STEAL 
Oakland A's outfielder Jose Canseco picked off someone trying to steal -- his 
boat. 
A hapless thief tried to roar off with Canseco's 42-foot boat as the slugger 
played volleyball Sunday on South Beach, a popular Art Deco district of Miami 
Beach. 
The boat's engine wouldn't cooperate, and police arrested 27-year-old Gregory 
Dudley adrift as he tried in vain to start it, Miami Beach police spokesman Jim 
Hyde said. 
Canseco had anchored near Penrod's Beach Club. "He swam in to play volleyball," 
Hyde said. 
About 6 p.m., Canseco quit. He spotted someone hiding behind the boat console. 
Canseco called police, who responded quickly -- Metro Dade police with a 
helicopter, Miami Beach police with a boat. The Florida Marine Patrol responded 
too. 
Police corraled Dudley and the drifting boat. Dudley was charged with attempted 
grand theft.
