  [Text] Mexico City, 11 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- A Zapatist 
National Liberation Army [EZLN] spokesman said that the EZLN has 
reportedly begun consultations at the grass roots level 
regarding commitments made with the Mexican Government during 
the peace talks held in San Cristobal de las Casas. 
  Major Mario told local and international media that the EZLN 
talks have reportedly taken place at La Garrocha ranch and the 
Pathuitz ejido, located 30 and 40 km away from San Miguel, in 
Chiapas. Mario added that the EZLN Indian Revolutionary 
Clandestine Committee-General Command and Subcommander Marcos 
will reportedly lead the consultations with representatives of 
Indian and peasant communities nationwide. 
  During the consultations the EZLN and the Indian and peasant 
representatives will accept or reject the commitments made with 
the government to improve their living standards. 
  On 1 January the EZLN occupied four cities in the Chiapas 
highlands as they violently demanded solutions to the social 
hardships of Indians. The EZLN violent actions forced the 
Mexican Army to intervene. 
  At the end of February the EZLN and Manuel Camacho Solis, 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, reached a 
34- point agreement to restore peace in Chiapas. This agreement 
must be ratified by the EZLN rank and file.
