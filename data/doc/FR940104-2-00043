 

Currently, Medicare covers diagnostic NPT testing. Although impotence is not a sleep disorder, the nature of the
testing requires that it be performed while a patient sleeps. As discussed in detail in section I.C. of this notice,
the OHTA technology assessment has concluded that NPT testing in the sleep disorder clinic is not a reliable index
for evaluating impotence. False-positive and false-negative results occur frequently indicating that NPT testing
is not a reliable indicator for choosing the appropriate treatment. Based on scientific evidence that indicates
that NPT testing is not a reliable index for evaluating impotence, we have concluded that NPT testing does not meet
our criteria for effectiveness, a primary requirement for Medicare program coverage. We believe the test has not
been performed often by medical practitioners because of the test's limited value. Therefore, we propose to withdraw
Medicare coverage of NPT testing in the sleep disorder clinic and exclude coverage of NPT testing by plethysmography
and other monitoring devices in all other settings. Our decision to withdraw coverage should have only a minimal effect
on small entities. 

Therefore, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we have determined,
and the Secretary certifies, that this notice would not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities and would not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.

we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. We will consider all comments we receive by the date
and time specified in the DATES

 section of this preamble, and, if we proceed with a subsequent document, we will respond to the comments in the preamble
to that document.
