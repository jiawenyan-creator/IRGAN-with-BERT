  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/6/1994 -- Observing that the 
economic and trade exchanges between Romania and the People's 
Republic of China were constantly growing, the Chinese minister 
of machine-building industry He Guangyuan told the Romanian 
Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu at the meeting they had at the Victoria 
Palace Thursday, 9 June, that this evolution should be supported 
by the two governments by diversified forms of trading and by 
expanding the cooperation range. The Chinese minister said his 
country had already adopted a package of measures meant to boost 
China's relations with Romania. 
  Prime Minister Vacaroiu's assessment was that, given the 
conditions offered by the market economy rules governing in both 
countries, the present volume of the bilateral exchanges could 
double.
