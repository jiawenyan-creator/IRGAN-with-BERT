Take notice that on January 31, 1994, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Edison) tendered for filing
proposed supplements to its Rate Schedules FERC No. 92 and FERC No. 96.

delivery service furnished to public customers of the New York Power Authority (NYPA) by $3,938,000 annually based
on the 12-month period ending March 31, 1995. 
The proposed Supplement No. 2 to Supplement No. 5 to Rate Schedule FERC No. 96, applicable to electric delivery service
to NYPA's non-public, economic development customers, and the proposed Supplement No. 2 to Supplement No. 3 to Rate
Schedule FERC No. 92, applicable to electric delivery service to commercial and industrial economic development

March 31, 1995. 
The proposed increases are a part of a Company-wide general electric rate increase application which Con Edison filed
to implement rates for the third year of a three-year rate plan previously approved by the New York Public Service Commission
(NYPSC) and which is pending before the NYPSC. 
Although the proposed supplements bear a nominal effective date of April 1, 1994, Con Edison will not seek permission
to make these effective until the effective date, estimated to be April 1, 1994 of the rate changes authorized by the
NYPSC. 
A copy of this filing has been served on NYPA, COWPUSA, NYCPUS, and the New York Public Service Commission.
