SHORT TAKES; 
FORBES PACES BIKER 'LOVE RIDE' 
Actors Gary Busey and Lorenzo Lamas joined tycoon Malcolm Forbes and 5,000 
other leather-clad bikers for a charity "Love Ride" through Southern 
California. 
"It's a sense of freedom. You and the road, you and the elements, generally a 
freedom feeling," the 70-year old Forbes said Sunday before leaving Glendale on 
a red-and-black Harley-Davidson. An estimated 5,000 bikers navigated the 
circuitous, 100-mile route to a ranch in the Santa Monica Mountains, raising 
$500,000 in pledges for the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. and the Jerry Lewis ALS 
Center. 
Entertainers at the post-ride barbecue at the Calamigos Ranch included 
motorcycle aficionado David Crosby.
