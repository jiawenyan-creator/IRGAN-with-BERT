where: 


(A) Exhaust=Exhaust NMHC emissions in g/mi using the test 
procedures specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart B and as 
calculated at 86.14494(1) of this chapter, with the fuel specifications 
contained in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. 
(B) Diurnal=Diurnal breathing loss emissions in grams 
using the test procedures specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart B 
and as calculated per 86.14396 of this chapter, with the fuel 
specifications and test temperatures contained in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) 
of this section. 
(C) Hot soak=Hot soak emissions in grams using the test 
procedures specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart B and as 
calculated in 86.14396 of this chapter, with the fuel specifications and test temperatures contained
in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. 
(D) Running Loss=Running loss emissions in g/mi using the 
test procedures specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart B and as 
calculated in 86.14396 of this chapter, with the fuel specifications and test temperatures contained
in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. 
(iv)(A) In testing the vehicle for both exhaust and 
evaporative emissions under 40 CFR part 86, subpart B, the test 
fuel used shall meet the specifications contained in paragraph 
9(a)(1)(ii) of the California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test 
Procedures for 1998 and subsequent Model Passenger Cars, Light-Duty Trucks and Medium-Duty Vehicles, as referenced
in 1956.8 of 
Title 13 of the California code of Regulations. 
(B) In testing the vehicle for diurnal, hot soak, and 
running loss emissions under 40 CFR part 86, subpart B, the 
following temperatures shall be used with no change in the 
specified tolerance about the mean temperatures:
