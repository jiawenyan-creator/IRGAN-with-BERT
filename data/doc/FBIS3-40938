  [Text] Kiev January 25 TASS -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk called upon the parliament to revise its attitude 
towards the ratification of the US-Soviet Strategic Arms 
Reduction Treaty (START-1) and the 1992 Lisbon Protocol. 
  An official letter by the president insisting that Ukraine 
should join the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty [NPT] was 
distributed among Ukrainian lawmakers on Tuesday. 
  Last November the Ukrainian parliament ratified the START-1 
imposing several tough conditions and stating that Ukraine 
should not join the NPT. 
  Ukraine's membership of the NPT was one of the key issues of 
the tripartite meeting of the Russian, American and Ukrainian 
presidents in Moscow. 
  The Ukrainian parliament is to consider the Moscow statement 
of the three presidents later this week.
