FT  04 OCT 93 / Israel to continue hunt for violent activists
MR YITZHAK RABIN, Israel's prime minister, said last night he had instructed
the army to continue its intensified hunt for violent Palestinian activists
in the occupied territories, thus ignoring protests from the Palestine
Liberation Organisation.
Two members of the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement were killed by the army
on Saturday, in a big offensive in the Gaza Strip that prompted a letter of
complaint to Mr Rabin from Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman.
Mr Rabin said that Israeli troops would continue to target 'all terror
forces'. He added that the army and security services had recently
uncovered, on the West Bank, three other Hamas cells believed to be
responsible for having killed two soldiers and three Jewish settlers.
The army's operation at the weekend involved hundreds of soldiers and
curfews being extended to large areas of the Gaza Strip.
The two Palestinians were killed when the army blew up an underground
hide-out in the Bureij refugee camp.
The men were named as Mr Hamed al-Krenawi, the commander of several Hamas
military units, and Mr Musa al-Sayeed.
Mr Arafat's letter of protest complained that the Gaza offensive - which had
followed the capture of six pro-PLO fighters in the West Bank earlier last
week - was in violation of the spirit of the autonomy and peace deal between
Israel and Palestinians.
The PLO also asked the US to press Israel into halting such operations.
But Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, retorted yesterday that his
understanding of the deal was that Israel and the PLO would join forces to
fight those who opposed it.
