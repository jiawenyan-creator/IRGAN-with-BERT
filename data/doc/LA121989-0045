Rookie Ramon Ramos of the Portland Trail Blazers, in a coma since suffering a 
severe brain injury in an auto accident early Saturday, underwent emergency 
surgery after taking a sudden turn for the worse. 
Dr. Kim Burchiel, head of neurosurgery at Oregon Health Sciences University, 
said the latest surgery appeared to be successful and that pressure on the 
right side of the brain had returned to normal when the operation ended. 
Ramos remained in critical condition with what doctors say is a 50-50 chance to 
live.
