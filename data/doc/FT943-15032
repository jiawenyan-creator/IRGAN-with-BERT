FT  12 JUL 94 / Dealer arrested
A former securities dealer at Swiss Bank Corporation in London has been
arrested in connection with alleged fraud, the bank confirmed yesterday.
He is suspected of having misappropriated just under Pounds 2m by
influencing the price of a bond warrant, the bank said. It said he had
traded on his own account for personal gain. No client money was involved
and the bank had 'no indication that anyone else is involved'.
