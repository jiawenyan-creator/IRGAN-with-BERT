  [Text] Baku (March 29) TURAN -- In the near future Russia 
will present a new plan on settlement of the conflict, said 
special envoy of Russian President, Vladimir Kazimirov. He said 
that the consultations of the experts of warring parties were 
conducted constructively. Kazimirov mentioned that the first 
and the foremost condition is complete cease-fire and then 
liberation of occupied territories. Then Kazimirov said that 
they could not find agreements on several points of the 
agreement since they can be settled by the top echelons of power.

only 
stage-by-stage settlement plan". At the same time Kazimirov 
said that "unfortunately, both parties do not refuse to settle 
the matter using military way".
