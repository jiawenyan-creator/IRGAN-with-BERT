VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE; 
COUNTY MAY TIGHTEN LANDSCAPING RULES 
Because of the drought, the county's planning staff may tighten landscape 
guidelines for new developments in the unincorporated areas to encourage water 
conservation. 
The staff will ask the County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday to approve 
revisions in the guidelines followed for commercial, industrial and residential 
developments that include common open space areas. 
Possible changes include restricting the use of water-thirsty grass, requiring 
more efficient irrigation equipment and practices, and checking to make sure 
landscaping was installed as called for in the plan. 
Any changes would be permanent. The staff met with the county's landscape 
architect consultants and members of the Water Conservation Landscape Task 
Force and recommended against tougher temporary restrictions designed to be in 
force until the end of the drought. 
If given the go-ahead, the staff would return to the supervisors in February 
with the proposed revisions for their final approval or denial. JANE HULSE
