  [Text] According to a press release by the Ukrainian 
Ministry of statistics, dated 28 March 1994, Ukraine's national 
income in 1993 is tentatively estimated at 98.4 trillion krb. 
Its absolute growth amounted to 94.5 trillion krb. with the 
nominal growth in factual prices versus 1992 exceeding 25 times, 
exclusively due to the price factor (wholesale and retail price 
growths for commodities and tariffs growths for services). 
  The price factor also affected the structure of national 
income in factual prices. Thus, the share of net produce in 
total industrial output increased from 49 per cent in 1992 to 
52.2 per cent in 1993, while the same parameter in agriculture 
dropped from 19.7 to 16.4 per cent. Industrial commodity prices 
grew 41-fold versus a 32-fold growth for agricultural products. 
  In comparable prices, national income's branch structure 
break-down appears different with industrial products' share 
having diminished from 49 to 48.8 per cent and that of 
agricultural products having increased by 3.3 points to amount 
to 23 per cent. 
  In 1993, national income decline rates somewhat decelerated, 
and amounted to 15 per cent versus 18 per cent the year before. 
Basically, this was due to decelerated reductions in 
construction, agricultural production and lower material 
consumption by certain branches of Ukraine's national economy. 
  Industrial net product output's reductions (by 15.6 per 
cent) 
were particularly adverse for national income, which were caused 
by a 7.6 per cent reduction in total industrial output and 
increased by 3.7 per cent material consumption. Beginning with 
1993's second semester over a half of Ukraine's industrial 
enterprises reduced their production. 
  Over the entire year, the bulk of these had to work under 
the 
very unfavorable conditions created by growing fuel and energy 
shortages. Thus, almost all the industrial branches reduced 
their production. 
  In 1993, construction and mounting works dropped by 9 per 
cent, which resulted in the construction industry's reduced 
total output by 8.7 per cent. Since material expenditures and 
costs reduced at a slower pace (by 8 per cent), the industry's 
net produce dropped by 9.2 per cent. 
  Total agricultural output reduced by 1.5 per cent with 
specific consumption of materials having dropped by 1.4 per 
cent, which resulted in net product output reduced by only 0.6 
per cent. 
  Negative processes were aggravated by steeply raised fuel 
prices and undersupplies of imported fuels in December 1993. 
GNP and national income over this period versus 1992 were as 
follows (in comparable prices, per cent).
