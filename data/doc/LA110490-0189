SENATE RACE RIVAL CRASHES HATFIELD NEWS CONFERENCE 
Republican Sen. Mark O. Hatfield's opponent crashed one of his news 
conferences, then got in the last question by asking Hatfield to debate him 
today. 
Hatfield, who has refused such requests from Democrat Harry Lonsdale, walked 
away without responding. 
"I'm conducting a press conference, not a circus," Hatfield said later when 
asked what he thought about Lonsdale's visit Friday. 
When Lonsdale appeared, Hatfield stumbled over his words before regaining his 
composure. 
Lonsdale stood silently as Hatfield criticized his opponent again for 
supporting Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh in 1985 after the Indian guru pleaded guilty 
to federal crimes. Lonsdale's claim that he was merely defending religious 
freedom does not wash, Hatfield said. 
"The issue isn't religious freedom; it's a question of judgment," he said. 
Lonsdale later criticized Hatfield for witnessing a shooting last year in 
Washington, D.C., and failing to report it to police. 
"As a citizen he had an obligation. As a senator, he had no excuse," Lonsdale 
said. "We all make mistakes and do things we regret. But Mark Hatfield should 
reflect on his own failings before he criticizes my judgment." 
At a separate news conference, Gary Kahn, Lonsdale's campaign counsel, called 
for a three-county task force to investigate a burglary at Lonsdale's home last 
week. 
The Deschutes County sheriff's office said the investigation has failed to turn 
up any suspects. Kahn stressed that he was not accusing the Hatfield campaign 
of committing the burglary. 
Julie McGregor, a spokeswoman for Hatfield, said the senator feels "it's 
unfortunate that such a crime should occur so close to an election, but it's 
equally unfortunate that Lonsdale is trying to lay blame on Hatfield 
supporters."
