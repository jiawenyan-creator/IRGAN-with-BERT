FT  28 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Grand Metropolitan
One could conclude that the interest of GrandMet subsidiary IDV in Gonzalez
Byass is a sign that the big drinks companies are scraping the barrel for
exciting brands. The UK sherry market, after all, has been in decline for
several years, and the scope for converting far-flung tipplers on IDV's
international distribution network to even a good name such as Tio Pepe must
surely be limited.
It would be wrong, however, to exaggerate the extent to which the worldwide
drinks industry has already concentrated. Of the top 100 global spirits
brands, for example, only 39 are owned by the Big Four (GrandMet, Guinness,
Allied Lyons and Seagram). Their collective reach is rather less in the five
main European markets. On the face of it, therefore, investors can expect
more deals as small- to medium-sized family proprietors feel the squeeze of
a protracted recession.
If the Cinzano model is followed, GrandMet might buy an initial minority
stake with a view to ultimate control. It would not do to overpay for GB's
largest selling Spanish brandy, though. The locals look to be turning in
growing numbers to GrandMet's J &amp; B whisky brand.
