 

(4) Vinyl ethyl ether.

(b) The following cargoes must be carried in an independent tank type C that meets 154.701(a):

(1) Ethylene oxide.

(2) Methyl bromide.

(3) Sulfur dioxide.

51. Section 154.1718 is added to read as follows:



154.1718 

Submerged electric cargo pumps.



The vapor space of cargo tanks equipped with submerged electric cargo pumps must be inerted to a positive pressure
before loading, during carriage, and during unloading of high vapor pressure flammable liquids.

52. Section 154.1720 is revised to read as follows:



154.1720 

Indirect refrigeration.



A refrigeration system that is used to cool acetaldehyde, ethylene oxide, methyl bromide, propylene oxide, mixtures
of propylene oxide/ethylene oxide, or sulfur dioxide must be an indirect refrigeration system that does not use vapor
compression.

53. Sections 154.1721 through 154.1724 are added to read as follows:



154.1721 

Piping systems for toxic products.



The cargo piping, vent piping, and refrigeration equipment of acargo tank carrying isopropylamine or monoethylamine
must be completely separate from all other piping systems on the vessel.



154.1722 

Flame screens on vent outlets.



When table 4 of this part refers to this section, the vent outlets need not comply with 154.805(c) but must meet
either of the following:

(a) Be provided with a flame screen that_

(1) Meets 30.1025 of this chapter;

(2) Is readily renewable; and

(3) Is designed and installed so as to prevent blockage by freezing cargo vapors or by icing in bad weather.

(b) Have a device approved by the Commandant (GMTH) to prevent the passage of flame.



154.1723 

Maximum allowable quantity of cargo per tank.



When table 4 of this part refers to this section, no person may operate a tankship that carries a cargo tank containing
in excess of 3,000 m

3

 (105,923 ft

3

) of the listed cargo.



154.1724 

Vapor return connections.



When table 4 of this part refers to this section, connections for returning the expelled gases ashore during loading
must be provided.



154.1735 

[Amended]



54. In 154.1735(b)(2)(ii), remove the word ``guage'' and add, in its place, the word ``gauge''.

55. Section 154.1745 is revised to read as follows:



154.1745 

Vinyl chloride: Transfer operations.



(a) The person in charge of a vinyl chloride transfer operation shall ensure that the following are complied with during
that operation:

(1) Cargo vapors are returned to the cargo tank or shore disposition for reclamation or destruction.

(2) Continuous monitoring for vinyl chloride vapor leaks is conducted. Fixed or portable instrumentation may be
used to ensure that personnel are not exposed to vinyl chloride vapor concentrations in excess of 1 ppm averaged over
any eight hour period or 5 ppm averaged over any period not exceeding 15 minutes. The method of monitoring and measurement
must have an accuracy (with a confidence level of 95%) of not less than plus or minus 50% from 0.25 ppm through 0.5 ppm,
plus or minus 35% from over 0.5 ppm through 1.0 ppm, and plus or minus 25% over 1.0 ppm.

(3) The cargo transfer operation is discontinued or corrective action is initiated by the person in charge to minimize
personnel exposure whenever a vinyl chloride vapor concentration in excess of 1 ppm is detected. If the vinyl chloride
concentration exceeds 5 ppm for over 15 minutes, action to reduce the leak may be continued only if each person in the
area of the leak uses a respirator which meets the following:

(i) The respirator must be approved by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under 30 CFR part 11. When filter
elements are used, they must include approval for vinyl chloride.

(ii) An electrically powered respirator also must meet the electrical engineering requirements in subchapter J
of this chapter for the electrical hazard class and group listed in table 4 of this part.

(4) Those portions of the cargo line that would be open to the atmosphere after piping is disconnected are free of vinyl
chloride liquid and that the vinyl chloride vapor concentration in the area of the vinyl chloride piping disconnect
points is not greater than 5 ppm.

(5) Any restricted gauge fitted on a tank containing vinyl chloride is locked or sealed so that the gauge cannot be used.
