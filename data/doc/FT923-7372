FT  18 AUG 92 / Greater education reform urged
THE NEXT stage of education reform should be a mechanism to help found new
state schools, according to Mr Madsen Pirie, president of the Adam Smith
Institute, the rightwing think-tank.
In a book to be published next month, Mr Pirie argues for a system whereby
'parents can get together, perhaps with local businesses, to found new state
schools which can be rapidly accepted for grant-maintained status'.
Mr Pirie - one of the government's panel of advisers on the Citizen's
Charter - suggests that the Education Department should consider preparing
and issuing 'a guidance manual for parents and teachers wishing to start new
schools'. He says it is clear that opted-out, grant-maintained status will
become 'the norm'.
In a wide examination of how privatisation, internal markets and the
Citizen's Charter aim to restructure society, he also turns his attention to
health, arguing that the next stage of NHS reforms should be 'the extension
of choice to patients themselves'.
He says: 'It would not require major changes to the fundholding system to
build in the incentives for practices to compete for patients. When patients
themselves can choose which organisation they wish to enrol with to handle
their health needs . . . the internal market in health will be functioning
fully.'
Mr Pirie argues in favour of a process of cross-fertilisation for the
Citizen's Charter: 'The best points of the good charters . . . need to be
copied by those services whose charters have been at best indifferent.'
He maintains that the charters affecting passengers, patients and parents
mean an important shift in power 'toward the consumers'.
