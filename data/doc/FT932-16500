FT  06 APR 93 / World Trade News: Pretoria rings in mobile phone network
SOUTH AFRICA yesterday took its first steps towards developing a national
cellular telephone network when the government invited applications for the
two licences it plans to award.
The government sees cellular telephones as a means of introducing
competition into the telecommunications field - dominated by the parastatal
Telkom - and as the cheapest and quickest means of offering most South
Africans access to a telephone.
Some fear the government may have set licence fees at a punitively high
level. Operators will have to pay an initial R100m (Pounds 21.8m) and 5 per
cent of net revenue in annual licence fees. Radio fees of R5m a year and
R20,000 a year for each 200kHz channel granted will also have to be paid.
Licences will be granted for 15 years. The two systems will probably cost
R3-400m each and have up to 400,000 subscribers jointly.
Licence applications have to be in by mid-June with the government hoping to
an announce its decision by June 30. Telkom has already been granted 50 per
cent of one licence. The UK company Cable &amp; Wireless is expected to tender
in partnership with M-Net, the locally based pay television station.
Selection criteria include such factors as the quality, reliability and
affordability of the service; technology transfer; local added value; job
creation; competition and consumer benefits and the financial soundness of
the applicant.
The government says a criterion which will 'weigh heavily' is how far the
applicant is prepared to provide telephone services to the underdeveloped
part of the community where services are expected to be uneconomic.
A recent study by Coopers &amp; Lybrand - based on 1989 data - found that only
2.4 per cent of South Africa's black population had phones - more than three
times the average for Africa, excluding South Africa, but only a tenth of
the penetration in South Africa's white community.
