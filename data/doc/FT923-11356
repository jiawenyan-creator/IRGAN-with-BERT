FT  25 JUL 92 / Ulster talks to enter third strand
A MEETING in Dublin next week between the British and Irish governments will
mark the start of a new phase in the talks on the political future of
Northern Ireland.
It represents the beginning of 'strand three' of the talks under the highly
complex structure for negotiations.
Yesterday it was agreed in Belfast that 'strand two', consisting of talks
between the British and Irish governments and four Ulster political parties,
would resume on September 1 after a five-week summer recess.
This decision was facilitated by an agreement to make the week beginning
September 28 the earliest date for the next meeting of the Anglo-Irish
Conference.
