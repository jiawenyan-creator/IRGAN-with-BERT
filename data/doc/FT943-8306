FT  18 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Nader opposes planned world trade body
Opponents of the proposed World Trade Organisation have mounted a television
advertising campaign warning that the US is turning its sovereignty over to
faceless bureaucrats in Geneva, writes Nancy Dunne from Washington. Mr Ralph
Nader's Public Citizen took the campaign to Capitol Hill this week with the
delivery of pillows to every member of Congress which bore an inscription
warning that the proposed body would 'kill popular consumer environmental
laws' or require 'perpetual sanctions when these laws are successfully
challenged in the organisation'. Gatt opponents are hoping to stall passage
of the implementing legislation for the Uruguay Round this year, as nearly
happened with the North American Free Trade Agreement.
