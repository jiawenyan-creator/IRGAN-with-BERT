SEYMOUR'S DECISION TO TURN PRO-CHOICE 
Re state Sen. John Seymour's (R-Anaheim) pro-choice position: 
The senator's new position on abortion is particularly laudable because it 
helps to clarify what it really means to be pro-choice. 
Every individual's right to judge abortion as right or wrong and to act 
personally according to his own convictions is to be respected. That is the 
cornerstone of pro-choice philosophy. But as the senator points out, to impose 
one's personal belief on others would not be "appropriate," especially through 
the "privileged power" he has as a state legislator. Using the power of the 
government to impose personally held beliefs is just as unacceptable as using 
tactics of intimidation and coercion. 
Especially profound is the senator's realization that the government should not 
discriminate against the poor in funding medical services. Politically it 
certainly wasn't necessary or even expedient to reach that conclusion. But it 
is decent and fair-minded.
