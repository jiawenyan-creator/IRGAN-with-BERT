FT  10 FEB 94 / BNF director offers apology
British Nuclear Fuels' legal director has apologised to a judge for a
television interview attacking Greenpeace, the environmental group, over its
High Court challenge to the government's decision to let the Thorp nuclear
reprocessing plant operate without a public inquiry.
Mr Justice Potts had expressed concern that Mr Alvin Shuttleworth, BNF
company secretary and legal director, had seemed to suggest that Greenpeace
was acting unreasonably or irrationally in bringing judicial review
proceedings.
The courts had ruled that the group had an arguable case.
