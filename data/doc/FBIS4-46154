  [Text] Israel can expect five to 10 difficult, unstable 
years ahead during the implementation of its agreement with the 
PLO and the establishment of autonomy, Police Inspector-General 
Asaf Hefetz yesterday told a gathering of retired senior police 
officers in Tel Aviv. Hefetz said he expects large-scale terror 
attacks and difficult situations ahead for the police. He 
therefore hopes to mold the police into a force with new 
capabilities that will enable it to deal with such situations.
