  [Text] It has been announced that the CSCE delegation, 
which will oversee the cease-fire between Azerbaijan and Armenia 
and which will observe withdrawal of troops, the normalization 
of transportation, and the return of refugees to their homes, is 
in no way a military delegation. 
  In reply to a question on the subject, Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Ferhat Ataman recalled that a peace plan has been 
drafted within the framework of the CSCE Minsk Group in an 
effort to resolve the armed conflict between Azerbaijan and 
Armenia. In accordance with this plan, Ataman explained, once a 
cease-fire is secured, an observer delegation to be comprised of 
CSCE countries will oversee the cease-fire. 
  Ataman declared: The observer delegation will be composed of 
military experts and civilian officials from CSCE countries. 
The task to be fulfilled by the delegation will in no way be a 
military operation. The personnel to be assigned to this 
mission do not comprise a military force or unit, but rather an 
observer delegation. The observer delegation is not assigned 
with the task of protecting the peace or resorting to force to 
this end. Moreover, the members of the delegation will not bear 
arms. 
  Ataman also noted that preparations are under way to 
establish a logistical support center in Erzurum to serve the 
delegation to be sent to the conflict area.
