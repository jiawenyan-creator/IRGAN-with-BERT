CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; 
CATALOGUES; 
THE SUNDANCE KID STRIKES AGAIN 
AT A TIME when society seems to move us further from some basic rhythms of our 
heritage and environment, we are pleased to offer products that remind us of 
both." So reads a line from Robert Redford in his Spring, 1990, Sundance 
catalogue. 
Many of the items in the catalogue's collection are Sundance exclusives, and 
most are carved, crafted, forged, woven, stamped, dyed and painted by hand by 
local craftspeople, including members of the Navajo, Tarahumara and Huichol 
Indian tribes. 
The Southwestern look dominates -- in everything from sterling-silver collar 
tips and jewelry, stoneware and pottery, Navajo-rug-design note pads, artwork 
and furniture, including a custom-crafted headboard of natural bird's-eye maple 
inlaid with ebony and green-stained poplar, and a Navajo sand-painting table. 
The Sundance catalogue, like the Institute itself, is named after Sundance 
General Store proprietor Robert Redford's character in the classic 1969 
picture, "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid." Also like the Institute, the 
catalogue is dedicated to emerging artists in all media, and a portion of the 
proceeds from sales goes toward the development of new talent in the arts and 
helping to preserve the environment. 
 The Sundance catalogue is available by telephone; call (800) 422-2770.
