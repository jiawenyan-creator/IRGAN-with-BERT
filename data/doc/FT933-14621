FT  13 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average rises on
hopes of an interest rate cut
HOPES OF an interest rate cut brought buying and this, together with
speculation on a reduction in income taxes, enabled the Nikkei average to
break briefly through the 20,000 level during the session for the first time
since June 16, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index was finally 102.61 firmer at 19,980.00, after a day's
high of 20,011.70 and low of 19,889.89.
Prices eased back later from their earlier highs on reports of the
bankruptcy of an over-the-counter company, and uncertainty over financial
support for EIE International, an unlisted speculative property developer.
Volume fell to 230m shares from 473m. Advances led declines by 542 to 419,
with 181 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose
5.06 to 1,613.68. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was unchanged at
1,227.62.
The yen weakened as the US-Japan bilateral talks ended with a trade
framework agreement calling for Japan to decrease its current account
surplus by increasing domestic demand, and expanding market access for
foreign products.
The dollar closed Y1.60 up at Y109.93, helping leading exporters. Hitachi
appreciated Y10 to Y851, Matsushita Electric Industrial gained Y30 at Y1,300
and Toyota Motor added Y30 at Y1,580.
Long Term Credit Bank and leading creditor banks of EIE International
announced that they would abandon restructuring of the company and write off
their exposure. Sea Com, an affiliate listed on the second section of the
TSE, was suspended, while another affiliate, Electronic and Industrial
Enterprises, was also suspended on the OTC market.
Phoenix Electric, a lighting equipment maker on the OTC market, was another
suspension, this time due to a subsidiary filing for bankruptcy.
Nikkatsu, the movie producer which recently filed for court protection, was
the most active issue of the day. It accounted for 30 per cent of total
volume and rose Y4 to Y29 in speculative trading.
Some financials gained ground on hopes of lower interest rates, with
Industrial Bank of Japan moving up Y10 to Y3,060 and Fuji Bank advancing Y40
to Y2,490.
Firm sales of new condominiums for June lifted real estate companies and
housing linked issues. Mitsui Fudosan rose Y10 to Y1,290.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 28.99 ahead at 21,958.22 in volume of 11.6m
shares. Many investors remained inactive ahead of the general election this
weekend.
