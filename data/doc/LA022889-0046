FAT, SUGAR IN BRAN CEREALS IMPORTANT POINT TO CONSIDER 
Question: Do bran cereals really provide as much fiber as the manufacturers 
claim? This seems to be one of the biggest selling points lately for all kinds 
of cereals. 
Answer: Some bran cereals do provide substantial amounts of fiber, as much as 9 
grams for each serving; however, I suggest you check on the fat and sugar 
content of the cereal before making a choice. 
Q: I would appreciate it if you would clarify the amount of sodium a person 
should have. My husband is well over 6 feet tall and weighs 220 pounds. I'm a 
foot shorter and weigh a hundred pounds less. It doesn't make sense that we 
should both take in the same amount of sodium. Does the difference in size make 
any difference in this? 
A: The amount of sodium an individual is permitted is related to the number of 
calories he or she consumes each day; obviously, you and your husband do not 
consume the same number of calories. 
A teaspoon of salt contains 2,300 milligrams of sodium. You should limit your 
consumption of sodium to no more than 1,000 milligrams for every 1,000 calories 
you consume. Thus, you and your husband would not have the same sodium intake.
