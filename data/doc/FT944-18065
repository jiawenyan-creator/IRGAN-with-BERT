FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Fiscal buys properties in Croydon for
Pounds 17.5m
Fiscal Properties, the investment and development company which floated on
the Stock Exchange in April, yesterday announced a Pounds 17.5m acquisition
of office and retail properties in Croydon, south London.
The company also reported a Pounds 562,000 pre-tax loss for the six months
to the end of June, against a Pounds 164,000 profit. The result includes
Pounds 990,000 non-recurring costs relating to flotation.
Turnover increased from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 4.5m and operating profit from
Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.8m. The interim dividend is 0.624p.
Fiscal is buying 47.5 per cent of Croydon Land and Estates from Montagu
Private Equity, the private equity arm of Midland Bank. CLE was set up
earlier this year to acquire the commercial property portfolio of the London
Borough of Croydon, comprising 156 properties generating rental income of
around Pounds 4.1m.
Directors of Fiscal already have an interest in 4 per cent of CLE. Montagu
Private Equity, one of the founding shareholders, still holds a 35 per cent
stake in Fiscal.
To avoid conflicts of interest, the terms of the transaction were negotiated
by Fiscal's non-executive directors.
The deal marks Fiscal's first move away from buildings occupied by
government.
