  [Text] Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
South Korean opposition Democratic Party denounced remarks of 
Kim Chong-pil claiming that the "May 16 military coup" in 1961 
was a "revolution", a Seoul-based radio report said. 
  In a commentary May 14 he said the utterances of the 
"chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party" justifying the "May 
16 military coup" which gave birth to the "Yusin" fascist 
dictatorship were "a mockery of history and a deception on the 
people".
