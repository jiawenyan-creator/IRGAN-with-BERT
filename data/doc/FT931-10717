FT  06 FEB 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Bequests to reduce IHT
YOU WILL be aware that when spouses contemplate making reciprocal wills, it
is advocated that they should first bequeath to their offspring as much as
they can afford up to the (present) exempt figure of Pounds 150,000 in order
to keep inheritance tax to a minimum.
If such a bequest is worded 'cash, or shares in public companies or other
securities' and such shares are transferred to beneficiaries, can you
confirm:
(a) that the acquisition cost for that person(s) is the probate value of the
shares transferred.
(b) that no CGT is payable at the time of transfer either by the estate, or
the beneficiary, on any appreciation which may have accrued to that date.
(c) CGT will be payable by the beneficiary on any future sale by him based
on the probate value.
We confirm that the acquisition cost would be the probate value. No capital
gains tax is payable upon the death of the transferor.
However, if the assets increase in value in the future, then there will be
CGT payable by the beneficiary on the difference between the sales proceeds
and the base cost of the shares.
The base cost would comprise the probate value as increased by the
indexation allowance, and the capital gain would be reduced by the annual
CGT exemption in the normal way.
