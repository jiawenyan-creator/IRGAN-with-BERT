P.M. BRIEFING; 
JAPAN WORKAHOLICS FAVOR LEISURE 
More and more Japanese -- whose legendary capacity for hard work is the 
backbone of a buoyant economy -- would rather have more free time than more pay 
if given the choice, according to a government survey released today. 
About 57% of those polled said they would prefer more leisure time to a pay 
raise, a 4% increase over a 1989 poll, the prime minister's office said. 
Just 22% said they would take a higher salary at the expense of leisure time, 
the lowest on record since the government initiated the poll in 1975. 
About 7,600 working adults responded to the nationwide poll conducted last May.
