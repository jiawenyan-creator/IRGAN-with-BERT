  [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Tuesday 
[31 May] the No. 2 opposition party is determined to investigate 
the suspected receipt by chief coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa 
of illegal donations from contractors. 
  Murayama, speaking at a press conference in Naha, southern 
Japan, hinted that the party would push the Diet to summon Ozawa 
to testify under oath concerning his alleged receipt of illegal 
donations from a contractor. 
  "It is the Diet's responsibility to clarify suspicions," 
Murayama said. 
  Diet Affairs Committee Chairman Sadatoshi Ozato of the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest opposition party, 
also said the LDP will quiz Ozawa on suspected money problems if 
he is summoned before the Diet. 
  Ozato told a separate press conference that "as (Ozawa) is a 
key person in the ruling parties, it is better (for him) to 
clear himself of suspicion." 
  Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
a core party in the coalition, has denied allegations which 
surfaced last November that he had regularly received illegal 
donations from major contractor Kajima Corp. over the past few 
years, saying they were "properly handled." 
  Ozawa is regarded as the de facto leader of Shinseito, which 
is nominally headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  Murayama said the SDP will possibly submit a no-confidence 
motion against the government led by Hata, depending on the 
coalition government's response to demands for the summoning of 
Ozawa. 
  If such a no-confidence motion is passed, the SDP chairman 
said, the cabinet should dissolve the House of Representative 
and call an election. 
  Both the SDP and LDP have said they will cooperate with the 
minority coalition only until the Diet passes the fiscal 1994 
state budget, threatening that they may submit a no-confidence 
motion at any time thereafter.
