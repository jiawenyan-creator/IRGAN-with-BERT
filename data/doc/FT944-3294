FT  14 DEC 94 / People: Forbes put in control of gas
Southern Electric is reshaping the top management team which has led the
company from privatisation, so as to deal with the next phase of
development.
Two directors will have their jobs redesigned to give the company a stronger
focus on the future.
Jim Forbes, the operations director with responsibility for the distribution
business, will take over as managing director, electricity, and will assume
wider responsibility for the supply business, including gas, which is one of
Southern's new areas. He will also have responsibility for raising
productivity and cutting costs.
Jim Hart, the commercial director, will become managing director, business
development, which includes regulatory matters and strategy. One of his key
tasks will be to find new business activities to replace earnings from the
National Grid  - to be sold next year  - and in which Southern has a ten per
cent stake.
The two will work alongside John Deane, the finance director, and all three
will report to Henry Casley, the chief executive. Casley says the changes
reflect Southern's determination 'to build on the positive benefits we have
already achieved for our customers and shareholders'.
