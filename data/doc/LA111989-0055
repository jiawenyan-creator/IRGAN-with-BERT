CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE AGE OF GRIEF BY JANE SMILEY (IVY BOOKS: $3.95) 
In this collection of short stories, Jane Smiley writes about contemporary 
romances that lack the commitment, understanding and respect which 
distinguished L'Engle's marriage. Her self-involved characters quickly tire of 
each other, their relationships and themselves. At the first sign of trouble, 
one or both partners simply decamp, physically or emotionally. The almost 
catatonic husband in the title story can't bring himself to confront his wife 
with his suspicions of her infidelity -- let alone face the problems that 
brought their marriage to this impasse. In another story, a young woman who 
wants a baby chooses a father who offers no possibility of emotional 
involvement: She feeds a gay friend marijuana-laced brownies, then consummates 
the relationship while he sleeps. The clean, vigorous style and strong 
characterizations in "The Age of Grief" reveal a young writer of considerable 
promise.
