Motorola Unveils Office Technology: The Schaumburg, Ill.-based electronics 
company said it has developed a new wireless technology that will allow 
companies to use radio waves to link computers into networks, eliminating the 
need for a myriad of wires in office buildings. 
The firm plans to introduce the first product based on the technology early in 
1991. Company officials expect sales of the system to 100 clients before it is 
widely available early next year.
