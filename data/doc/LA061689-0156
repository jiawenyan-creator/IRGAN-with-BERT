BUSH REPLACES KENNEDY'S DESK 
Moving to put his own mark on the Oval Office, President Bush has jettisoned 
the desk first used by John F. Kennedy, his spokesman said today. 
Marlin Fitzwater said Bush ordered his own desk, which he has used since May 2, 
1985, installed in the Oval Office on June 13. "He had it as vice president, 
and he got used to it, found it comfortable, thought it was attractive," 
Fitzwater said, elaborating on Bush's new work station. 
Bush's desk was one of four made-to-order about 1920 for the owners of the 
Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Co. It was placed in the company's office in Ohio. 
Later, the CSX Corp., parent company of the C&amp;O Railway donated the desk to 
the White House. After his inauguration, Bush used the desk in his private 
residential quarters. 
Fitzwater said the desk replaces the one "used there by Presidents Kennedy, 
Carter and Reagan." The old desk has been returned to the White House storage 
bin.
