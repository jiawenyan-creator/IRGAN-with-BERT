FT  20 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax on empty home
MY BROTHER and I own a property jointly as tenants in common. It was the
home of our mother, who lived there rent-free. She became ill and in
November 1991 had to go permanently into a nursing home.
Her furniture was sold or otherwise disposed-of, so the property has been
unfurnished since November 1991. It has been empty and for sale since that
date.
1. Community charge. Is there any liability from November 1991 until when
the community charge stops on April 1 1993? I have been informed that the
standard charge might be levied. Is this correct?
2. Council tax. Is there any liability from April 1 1993? If there is
liability, does the six-months-empty property exemption run from April 1
1993? It can hardly start running before the tax comes into being - can it?
1. Community charge. Your mother will have ceased to be subject to the
charge on going into residential care, and an adjustment will fall to be
made, either by way of refund or by payment of what was due to the date of
her ceasing to be resident at the property. You may be liable for the
balance of the year at the standard charge.
2. Council tax. You will be liable, as owners of unoccupied property, from
April 1 1993. There is no equivalent of the rating exemption for empty
property.
