FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Austrian insurer holds dividend
EA-Generali, Austria's second largest insurance group, said its premium
income rose 7 per cent in 1994, to Sch36.5bn (Dollars 3.3bn), and reaffirmed
its intention to maintain its 15 per cent dividend.
EA-Generali is 80 per cent-owned by Assicurazioni Generali of Trieste and
operates in Austria, Germany, Hungary and the Czech Republic for Generali.
The Vienna-based group said premium income of its five Austrian primary
insurance subsidiaries rose 10 per cent to Sch23.7bn, and its four German
subsidiaries showed similar growth, to Sch10.5bn.
Premium income of the two Hungarian subsidiaries was up 11 per cent to
Sch1.6bn, while operations in the Czech Republic were in a start-up phase.
Reinsurance revenues from third parties fell 40 per cent to Sch800m
following the group's decision to concentrate on internal business.
Earnings per share were expected to rise from Sch105 in 1993 to Sch108.
Mr Dietrich Karner, chief executive, said that the group was satisfied with
its results in a year in which its operating environment had changed
drastically. Austria has liberalised its insurance markets ahead of joining
the European Union.
