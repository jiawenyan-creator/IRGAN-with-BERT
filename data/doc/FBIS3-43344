  [Text] The PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] has again denied 
that it's responsible for last week's Heidelberg Tavern attack. 
At a Cape Town news conference today PAC negotiator Patricia de 
Lille said the organization has consistently condemned all acts 
of violence and is busy negotiating a comprehensive mutual 
cessation of hostilities with the government. She says the 
PAC's armed wing, APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army], has 
declared a moratorium on its armed struggle while talks on 
ending hostilities are underway. De Lille says follow-up 
discussions between the PAC and the government, and APLA and the 
SADF [South African Defense Force], are to be held within the 
next two weeks. 
  The PAC also strongly condemned the detention of two of its 
senior officials in connection with the Heidelberg attack. 
Michael Siyolo and Theo Mabusela were detained yesterday for 
questioning. Both men are being held under Section 29 of the 
Internal Security Act.
