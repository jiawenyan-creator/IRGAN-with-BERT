  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- New Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata on Thursday [28 April] retained Administrative Deputy Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara, who has served for a record 
six years and five months, government officials said. 
  Ishihara, 67, now has worked for six consecutive 
administrations since the launch in November 1987 of a 
government under Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita of the Liberal 
Democratic Party, the officials said. Last April, he broke the 
record of long service at the post of the top administrative 
official. 
  Ishihara wanted to resign but Hata asked him to continue 
because the government has a lot to do, including Diet 
deliberations on the overdue state budget for fiscal 1994, which 
began April 1, and efforts to resume "framework" trade talks 
with the United States, they said. 
  Meanwhile, Hata named Naoto Kitamura, a House of 
Representatives member of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], to 
the post of parliamentary deputy chief cabinet secretary. 
Kitamura, 46, is known as a key aide to Ichiro Ozawa, the most 
powerful strategist of the ruling coalition.
