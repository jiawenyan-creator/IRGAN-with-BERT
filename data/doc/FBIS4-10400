  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas -- Subcommander Marcos 
has said the second stage of negotiations between the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army [EZLN] and Peace Commissioner Manuel 
Camacho Solis, which was supposed to begin here yesterday, was 
postponed following Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination. 
  The EZLN leader did not give a date for restarting the 
dialogue, nor has the government. Sources that asked not to be 
identified have said Peace Commissioner Camacho Solis will 
arrive in San Cristobal de las Casas on 5 April. The source 
added part of the team and Camacho Solis could arrive on the 
first commercial flight to Tuxtla Gutierrez on 5 April. 
  The commissioner suspended his message on restarting talks 
he 
was to give the media on 23 March, because Colosio was 
assassinated that day. No one knows the content of Camacho 
Solis' new message, because the one he was to deliver two weeks 
ago concerned restarting negotiations with the self-styled EZLN. 
According to reports from Marcos, the second stage of talks 
should have begun yesterday in what has become known as the 
Peace Cathedral here in San Cristobal de las Casas. 
  The announcement the peace commissioner will make will also 
be influenced by the decision of the Clandestine Indian 
Revolutionary Committee-General Command to suspend consultations 
with the EZLN over an alleged withdrawal of Mexican Army troops 
from their territories. 
  Up to yesterday there was no communique from Marcos to 
report 
the resumption of talks between the armed group on Camacho 
Solis' proposals. 
  Mexican Army troops enjoyed a fourth day off thanks to a 
decision by the 31st Military Zone based in Tuxtla Gutierrez 
granting rest and relaxation to soldiers who had spent the most 
time in the front.
