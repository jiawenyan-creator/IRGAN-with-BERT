FT  04 NOV 92 / Kenya returns to multi-party elections on December 7
KENYA will hold its first multi-party elections for 26 years on December 7,
according to state television, Reuter reports from Nairobi.
President Daniel arap Moi had said often the polls will be 'very soon' and
election fever has gripped the nation during weeks of often violent
campaigning. A late and reluctant convert to democracy, Mr Moi faces a
fragmented and squabbling opposition whose disarray enhances the chances of
his ruling Kenya African National Union (Kanu).
In a rare display of unity, the opposition yesterday unveiled a common
strategy for reviving the faltering economy. A coalition of four opposition
parties said they had agreed joint policies to revive growth and bring
prosperity to the east African country.
The strategy pledges to reform the mainstay tea, coffee and tourism sectors
and to end corruption which has driven away foreign investment. A heavy
turnout was reported as Ghanaians voted in presidential elections which end
the military rule that has helped make the country a model of economic
success, AP reports from Accra. The Angolan capital Luanda was quiet
yesterday and life started returning to normal under a United
Nations-sponsored ceasefire after weekend fighting that state radio said
killed up to 1,000 across the country.
However, witnesses said a convoy of military vehicles moved out of Luanda to
the north-east towards Bengo province where Unita rebels were reported last
week to have massed 7,000 soldiers. Cameroon's President Paul Biya was sworn
in for a third five-year term yesterday, promising changes to the
constitution and silencing challenges to his re-election with an army
crackdown in the north-west, Reuter adds from Yaounde. Mr John Fru Ndi,
opposition candidate, is under house arrest.
