FOR THE RECORD 
Lawsuit -- An item in The Top of Today's News summaries in Tuesday stated 
incorrectly that author Inette Miller is suing ABC to get on-screen credit for 
the film based on her book, "Burning Bridges." In fact, she is suing 
Lorimar-Telepictures, the company that produced the TV movie.
