Second Report and Order,

 the Commission stated that applicants filing short form applications would be required to certify that they are financially
qualified pursuant to Section 308(b) of the Communications Act. The applicants would also be required to certify
that they satisfy any financial qualification requirements for the service in question.

Petition.

 AIDE states that applying competitive bidding and payment requirements in addition to existing financial qualification
requirements disadvantages designated entities, who have historically been constrained by difficulties in capital
formation and financing. AIDE recommends that short-form applications not require and certification of financial
qualification. If an application become mutually exclusive, according to AIDE, the applicant's payment of its winning
bid would demonstrate that it was financially qualified. If the application did not become mutually exclusive, then
the applicant should have a short period in which to file any required demonstration of financial qualifications
by amendment.

Discussion.

 We believe that, in order to prevent the delay in bringing service to the public that might be occasioned by bankruptcies
or by prolonged financial negotiations, it is important to require licensee to have the financial ability to construct
and operate a system in addition to being able to purchase the license. Consequently we will continue to require applicants
to certify on their short-form applications that they meet any existing financial qualification requirements of
the services in which licenses are auctioned. We will not, however, impose additional showings of financial qualification
as part of the auction process.



IV. Designated Entities



A. Introduction



64. Several provisions of the Budget Act address participation by small businesses, rural telephone companies,
and businesses owned by women and minorities (referred to collectively as ``designated entities'') in the competitive
bidding process and in the provision of spectrum-based services. Specifically, Section 309(j)(4)(D) of the Act,
provides that, in prescribing competitive bidding regulations, the Commission shall, 

inter alia,

 ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and
women are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services, and, for such purposes,
consider the use of tax certificates, bidding preferences, and other procedures***

In addition, section 309(j)(3)(B), provides that in establishing eligibility criteria and bidding methodologies
the Commission shall seek to promote the objectives of ``economic opportunity and competition and ensur[e] that
new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive concentration
of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural
telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.'' To promote these objectives,
section 309(j)(4)(A) expressly states that the Commission is required ``to consider *** alternative
payment schedules and methods of calculation, including lump sums or guaranteed installment payments, with or without
royalty payments, or other schedules or methods.''

the objective to promote ``the development and rapid deployment of new technologies, products, and services for
the benefit of the public, including those residing in rural areas, without administrative or judicial delays'';
section 309(j)(12)(D)(iv), requiring that the Commission's 1997 report to Congress evaluate, 

inter alia,

 whether and to what extent ``small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority
groups and women wee able to participate successfully in the competitive bidding process.''

</FOOTNOTE>


65. In the 

Second Report and Order

 we adopted a broad menu of provisions that the Commission might employ to implement these statutory provisions. We
adopted general provisions and eligibility rules designed to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies,
and businesses owned by members of minority groups and/or women were afforded the opportunity to participate in both
the competitive bidding process and in the provision of spectrum-based services. Specifically, we provide that
small businesses (including those owned by women and/or minorities and rural telephone companies) that are winning
bidders for certain blocks of spectrum could pay in installments over the term of their licenses. We also indicated
that rural telephone companies may be eligible for bidding credits for licenses obtained in their service areas if
they make an additional infrastructure build-our commitment beyond any existing performance requirements. We
indicated that bidding credits may be available to designated entities on certain frequency blocks. In addition,
we retained the option of establishing set-aside spectrum in certain services, in which eligibility to bid may be
limited to some or all designated entities. Finally, we stated that we would consider the use of tax certificates as
a means of creating incentives both for designated entities to attract capital from non-controlling investors and
to encourage licensees to assign licenses to designated entities in post-auction transactions.

66. In the 

Second Report and Order

 we recognized that the provisions applicable to particular designated entities would vary depending on the nature
of each individual service. For example, we retained the discretion to modify our general designated entity provisions
for capital intensive services such as broadband PCS. In this regard, we stated that we would evaluate on a service-specific
basis the capital requirements and other characteristics of the service to determine the appropriate provisions.
We continue to believe that it is essential for the Commission to retain flexibility to select, and if necessary to
modify, the general designated entity provisions and eligibility requirements on a service-specific basis depending
on the capital requirements and construction costs of the particular service.



B. Rural Telephone Company Definition



67. 

Background.

 In the 

Second Report and Order,

 we adopted a definition of ``rural telephone company'' that includes independently owned and operated local exchange
carriers that (1) do not serve communities with more than 10,000 inhabitants in the licensed area, and (2) do not have
more than 50,000 access lines, including all affiliates.
<FOOTCITE>108</FOOTCITE>
 We stated our belief that a limitation on the size of eligible rural telephone companies was appropriate because Congress
did not intend for us to provide special treatment to large LECs that happen to serve small rural communities.

Petitions.

 Several parties filed petitions for reconsideration of the 

Second Report and Order

 requesting that we modify our standard definition for rural telephone companies. Petitioners' proposals include
requests that the Commission amend its definition of ``rural telephone company'' (1) to expressly include municipal-
and government-owned telephone companies within the ``rural telephone company'' definition in accordance with
the earlier Senate version of the Budget Act,
<FOOTCITE>110</FOOTCITE>
 (2) to define ``rural telephone company'' as a local exchange carrier with annual revenues of less than $100 million
or serving no more than 100,000 access lines;
<FOOTCITE>111</FOOTCITE>
 and (3) to include within the definition of ``independently owned and operated'' LECs that either operate 50,000
access lines or less serve communities of 10,000 or fewer inhabitants.

69. In addition, Blooston, Mordkofsky, Jackson  Dickens (Blooston) and South Dakota Networks, Inc. (SDN) request
that the Commission eliminate the term ``independently owned and operated'' from the definition of ``rural telephone
company.'' According to Blooston, this restriction is unnecessary to prevent the largest telephone companies from
taking advantage of provisions provided for rural telephone companies, since this same purpose is already served
by the 50,000 access line limit, Blooston argues the Commission should amend its eligibility rules to indicate that
they include the access lines of affiliates. Similarly, SDN indicates that the Commission should include ``and affiliates''
after ``50,000 or fewer access lines'' in the current definition. SDN maintains that the current language penalizes
holding companies structured to permit telephone companies to offer paging and other nonregulated services.
