FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Tecs positive in spite of
cut for programmes in real terms - Training
TRAINING and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) described the Employment
Department's package of training and job-seeking measures for the unemployed
and young people as positive given the current constraints on spending.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, has fought hard to defend
her total budget which at Pounds 4.1bn will show a real increase of 1 per
cent on expenditure in 1992-93. Part of this will be for planned
redundancies in the department. Expenditure on training programmes including
Youth Training and Employment Training - which is to be merged with
Employment Action, the work experience scheme - will suffer a cut in real
terms of 3 per cent.
The majority of the increases will be spent on non-training initiatives,
such as Job Clubs, which the government claims are cost-effective ways to
get people back to work. Critics say they do not increase individuals'
skills.
Schemes will be extended and will include Jobplan workshops for all people
who have been unemployed for more than a year and not taken up offers of
help.
The package will disappoint Tecs, which administer government-
funded training schemes. They wanted a more radical overhaul of training
programmes, including 'entitlement credits' to allow the unemployed to
choose different options.
The package will mollify them to the extent that some of their requests have
been met, including guarantees of funding for most programmes for three
years.
