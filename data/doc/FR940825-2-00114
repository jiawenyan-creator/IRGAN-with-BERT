 

United States of America, Plaintiff, v. S.C. Johnson  Son, Inc. and Bayer A. G., Defendants. Civil No. 94C50249.



United States' Explanation of Consent Decree Procedures



The United States submits this short memorandum summarizing the procedures regarding the Court's entry of the proposed
Final Judgment. The Judgment would settle this case pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C.
16(b)(h) (the ``APPA''), which applies to civil antitrust cases brought and settled by the United States.

1. Today, the United States has filed a proposed Final Judgment and a Stipulation between the parties by which they
agreed to the Court's entry of the proposed Final Judgment following compliance with the APPA.

2. The United States has also filed a Competitive Impact Statement relating to the proposed Judgment [15 U.S.C. 16(b)].

3. The APPA requires that the United States publish the proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement
in the 

Federal Register

 and in certain newspapers at least 60 days prior to entry of the Final Judgment. The notice will inform members of the
public that they may submit comments about the Final Judgment to the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust
Division [15 U.S.C. 16(b)(c)].

4. During the 60-day period, the United States will consider and respond to any comments it receives, and it will publish
the comments and responses in the 

Federal Register

.

5. After the expiration of the 60-day period, the United States will file with the Court the comments, the government's
responses, and a Motion For Entry of the Final Judgment (unless the United States decide to withdraw its consent to
entry of the Final Judgment, as permitted by Paragraph 2 of the Stipulation) [

see

 15 U.S.C. 16(d)].

6. At that time, pursuant to the APPA, 15 U.S.C. 16(e)(f), the Court may enter the Final Judgment without
a hearing, if the Court determines that the Final Judgment is in the public interest.
