FT  05 JUL 93 / 'It could be a nightmare' warns RAC
CITY OF London workers were urged by the police and motoring organisations
to leave their cars at home, or face major delays, as the experimental
scheme of traffic regulation in the heart of the capital faces its first
Monday morning.
The RAC, the motoring organisation, said: 'Potentially it could be a
nightmare. The cost and disruption to everyone could be enormous.'
The RAC, along with several other bodies including the City of London
police, spent a busy day yesterday issuing a list of 'do's and don'ts' to
the travelling public. They included:
Leave your car at home if possible.
Motorists crossing the River Thames should avoid the City.
Do not expect any extra parking spaces in the boroughs on the fringes of the
City.
Allow an extra 30 minutes if travelling through the City in a car or bus.
Forget your old routes and follow the diversion signs. The City of London
Police said: 'You cannot drive in or out of the City except at the
designated spots. All other routes will be barricaded.'
Do not attempt to drive around or through the temporary barriers - driving
irregularly could set off a security alert.
Tune into your local radio station to find routes to avoid. LBC, on 97.3 FM
and 1152 kHz, has travel news from 6am and bulletins every 10 minutes until
9am. Capital Radio has regular traffic reports from 6am on 95.8 FM.
Use the traffic hotline. The Corporation of London is providing a hotline in
conjunction with the City of London Police for traffic information only on
071 332-3555. from 6am to 5pm today and from 9am to 5pm tomorrow.
Check that your usual bus has not been re-routed. A bus information hotline
is on 071 222-1234.
Buses affected include 8, 15, 15B, 15X, 17, 22A, 22B, 25, 26, 35, 42, 47,
48, 78, 141, 149, 172, 214, 271, 344, 505, D1, D9, D11 and night buses N8,
N26 and N83.
Do use the train. Rail and underground travel is unaffected and should
operate as normal.
Walk. All pedestrian routes are unaffected.
Stay alert to the threat of bombs - both in the City and elsewhere in the
capital. Report all suspicious packages.
