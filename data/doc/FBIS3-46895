  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 6 KYODO -- The Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry has asked the Finance Ministry to 
force commercial banks to disclose details of their fund 
operations concerning demand deposits, Postal Ministry officials 
said Thursday [6 January]. The request was made in connection 
with the scheduled liberalization of interest rates on ordinary 
postal savings, equivalent to bank demand deposits, within this 
year. 
  The Finance Ministry says that after liberalization, the 
interest rate on ordinary postal savings should be based on 
demand deposit interest rates, which are lower. 
  In that case, the postal ministry says, the banks should be 
required to disclose detailed information on their demand 
deposit fund operations. 
  Currently, the annual interest rate on ordinary postal 
savings is set at 1.32 percent, while that on bank demand 
deposits is 0.22 percent.
