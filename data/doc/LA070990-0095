ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; 
COMMISSIONER WHO CRITICIZED LOSES POST 
A planning commissioner who sharply criticized the City Council during his 
recent unsuccessful campaign for a council seat lost his seat on the commission 
last week. 
Harold Kaufman, who spent a two-year term on the city's first Planning 
Commission, was not reappointed by the council for another term. 
Kaufman, an insurance claims settler, was the only city commissioner seeking 
reappointment to be rejected for a new term. 
"I guess that's politics," Kaufman said. "But I plan to continue being active 
in this city as much as I am able to." 
While campaigning for a council seat in the June 5 election, Kaufman had openly 
criticized the City Council members for overturning Planning Commission 
decisions. He also accused them of being too influenced by developers. 
Seven candidates sought three council seats in that election. Kaufman came in 
fourth. 
Last week, when making appointments to three commission seats, the council 
chose incumbent Lynn Dawson and newcomers Robert Montgomery and James Hyde. 
City Councilman Mike Eggers, who had borne the brunt of Kaufman's criticism 
during the campaign, entered the motion naming the three appointees. The vote 
was unanimous. 
Eggers denied it had anything to do with the council race. 
This is not a campaign issue," Eggers said. "I can withstand personal attacks; 
I've been attacked before." 
But, Eggers said, "we wanted people with respect for each other and respect for 
the staff and, based on (Kaufman's) comments, he doesn't have much respect for 
the council. With all the work we have to do, putting together a general plan, 
a redevelopment agency and a $3-million capital improvement budget, I wanted 
everybody moving in the same direction." LEN HALL
