FT  20 MAY 93 / Guildford Four police acquittal
THREE FORMER Surrey detectives accused of manufacturing notes of interviews
with one of the Guildford Four were yesterday acquitted of conspiracy to
pervert the course of justice, Robert Rice writes.
Ex-Detective Chief Inspector Thomas Style, 59, ex-Detective Sergeant John
Donaldson, 57, and former Detective Constable Vernon Attwell, 52, were
accused of lying on oath that notes of interviews with Patrick Armstrong
were contemporaneous when they had been compiled later from rough notes.
In the interviews Mr Armstrong confessed to planting a bomb in the Horse and
Groom pub, Guildford in October 1974.
Mr Armstrong, Mr Gerard Conlon, Mr Paul Hill and Ms Carole Richardson
received life sentences in 1975 for the bombings of the Horse and Groom and
Seven Stars pubs in Guildford. Their convictions were quashed by the Appeal
Court in October 1989 after it had heard how investigating police officers
had altered notes of interviews, suppressed significant material and given
false evidence.
