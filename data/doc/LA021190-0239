RECORD RACK: BASIA'S TRAVELS: SPRUCING UP OLD TURF; 
*** 1/2: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A 
CLASSIC).; 
BASIA / "LONDON, WARSAW, NEW YORK" EPIC 
On the best songs on her million-selling debut album "Time and Tide" two years 
ago, the Polish singer coolly meshed Brazilian jazz and pop, establishing 
herself as a dazzling re-creation of '60s bossa nova star Astrud Gilberto. 
Basia even did a better Gilberto than Sade, who's been mimicking Gilberto since 
the early '80s. 
Basia, though, embellished that style, using it as a jumping off point to 
something more gritty and soulful. 
Basia's follow-up album, again co-written with Danny White (who co-produced the 
album with Basia), surpasses the first one, boasting more elegantly-crafted 
songs -- most floating along on those sleek, intoxicating Brazilian rhythms. 
Though she flaunts her soul chops on a gently funky version of Aretha 
Franklin's oldie "Until You Come Back to Me," it's Basia's jazz-style vocals 
that make this collection so outstanding. Her voice isn't powerful, but rather 
slight and teasing. To add flavor, she often sings tantalizingly off-key. Her 
vocals are the showpiece of lush, loping numbers like "Cruisin' for Bruisin' " 
and "Baby You're Mine." 
Basia doesn't break new ground with this album, but revitalizes and spruces up 
old turf -- in the process coming up with the best pop-Brazilian album in 
years. DENNIS HUNT
