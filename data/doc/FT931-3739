FT  13 MAR 93 / Venezuelan president faces fraud ruling
VENEZUELA'S attorney general has asked the Supreme Court to rule whether
President Carlos Andres Perez can be charged with fraudulent use of Dollars
17m (Pounds 11.9m) in government funds.
The attorney general, Mr Ramon Escovar Salom, asserted in documents filed
with the High Court that Mr Perez and two former ministers misused funds
from a secret state account managed by the president, the minister of the
interior and a limited group of high officials.
However, the constitutional grounds for such unprecedented action in
pressing criminal charges against a sitting president are not clear in
Venezuela.
Mr Perez began his five year presidential term in February 1989.
