  [Text] The functions of the CIS Defense Ministers' Council 
have been changed. It now becomes the main consultative body on 
military matters of the Collective Security Council. 
  [Aleksandr Ostrovskiy] The session of CIS defense ministers 
considered the formulation of the Council and the organization 
of its activities. It is proposed that it consist of 250 
individuals, half of whom will be from the Russian Defense 
Ministry. The main form for the work of the Defense Ministers' 
Council will be its sessions, which will be held at least once 
every three months. 
  The session also considered one of the main issues -- the 
Tajik-Afghan border -- since the armed provocations against 
Russian border guards have taken on the form of continual combat 
actions. Since the start of the year alone there have been 
intensive rocket bombardments on 21 occasions. [Video shows 
brief interviews] 
  [Tajik Defense Minister A. Shishlyannikov] There are 
continual incidents, including attempts to break through and 
attempted armed provocations, but at least for the present they 
are all being successfully repelled. 
  [Russian Deputy Defense Minister B. Gromov] I think that 
under no circumstance should we forget our experience within the 
Warsaw Pact. You rightly mentioned the matter of interaction 
and other things and ensuring military-technical cooperation. 
That is to say, it applies to all aspects. 
  [L.Ivashov, secretary of the CIS Defense Ministers' Council] 
At present the discussion has been solely about the CIS 
coordinating bodies, namely the Defense Ministers' Council and 
the headquarters for the coordination of military cooperation. 
Naturally a whole range of other issues will also be considered. 
  [Ostrovskiy] The first step has been taken. What will the 
second step be? 
  [Ivashov] As a second step we hope that Gennadiy Ivanovich 
Shabannikov, general secretary of the Collective Security 
Council, will present the Collective Security Council with 
specific proposals for formulating a model for collective 
security, and forming the structures of the treaty member 
states, and some kind of plan for the stage by stage creation of 
the system.
