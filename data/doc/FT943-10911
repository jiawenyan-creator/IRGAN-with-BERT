FT  02 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges lower as
Shanghai A shares surge 36%
The rise in the yen on worries over the breakdown of the Japan-US trade
talks depressed some blue chip exporters, and the Nikkei 225 average lost
ground in the lowest trading volume for three months, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The index closed 178.04 off at the day's low of 20,271.35. Shares rose in
the morning session, pushing the index to a day's high of 20,423.78, but
fell later on arbitrage unwinding due to a drop in futures prices.
Volume shrank to 170m shares, the lowest since May 9, from Friday's 270m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 7.59 to 1,629.82 while
the Nikkei 300 lost 1.49 at 295.67. Declines outscored advances by 667 to
313, with 181 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 2.49
firmer at 1,322.50.
Traders said selling by overseas investors, which depressed equities earlier
last week, seemed to have run its course. But the sharp rebound of the yen
weighed on blue chip stocks, which had suffered from the sell-off by
foreigners.
Some analysts said further selling could depress share prices this week.
'Though bearishness prevails, the major indices have not fallen enough to
register oversold readings,' said Kleinwort Benson in its most recent
report. It predicted a downside target of 19,470 for the Nikkei 225.
Shares bought on margin in February met selling ahead of the six-month
margin expiration. Tokyo Electric Power receded Y60 to Y2,970 and Fujikura,
the optical cable maker, ended Y19 off at Y810.
High-technology issues declined, Fujitsu shedding Y20 to Y1,030, but some
electrical stocks which retreated on overseas selling last week firmed on
bargain hunting. Toshiba put on Y14 at Y747 and Hitachi gained Y4 at Y969.
Banks were lower on arbitrage selling.
Kumagai Gumi, a general contractor, climbed Y15 to Y541 on buying by foreign
brokers on expectations of higher profits on a rise in domestic demand.
In Osaka, the OSE average eased 53.15 to 22,683.34 in volume of 51m shares.
