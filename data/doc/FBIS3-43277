  [Text] Lagos, Jan 3 (AFP) -- Nigerian security agents have 
seized about 50,000 copies of this week's edition of the TELL 
news magazine, the management of the magazine has announced. 
  Sunday's crackdown was the first move against the press 
since 
the military regime of General Sani Abacha came to power last 
November 17. 
  The editor-in-chief of the magazine, Nosa Igiebor, said in 
an 
official statement quoted by the press Monday that the magazine 
has as its cover headline "The Return of Tyranny: Abacha Bares 
His Fangs". The article concerned examines 10 decrees made 
public two weeks ago, most of which terminated jurisdiction by 
the courts in matters pertaining to the new military 
administration. 
  Several prominent Nigerians and human rights organisations 
have criticised the laws, which Justice Minister Olu Onagoruwa 
said would be amended, as they were printed before his 
appointment. 
  Igiebor's company lost thousands of naira (thousands of 
dollars) last year under the regime of General Ibrahim Babangida 
following the seizure, at various times, of about 300,000 copies 
of the magazine which the authorities considered critical. 
  Babangida last year annulled the outcome of a long-awaited 
presidential poll in June, failed to hand over power to elected 
civilians as he had pledged after 10 years of military rule, and 
installed an unelected transitional civilian premier in August. 
The military replaced that government almost three months later. 
  TELL's editors, staff, distributors and vendors were 
constantly detained, arrested, harrassed and beaten for the most 
part of last year, Igiebor said.
