WILL ON CAMPUS CENSORSHIP 
In his column "U.S. Campuses Are Putting Sensitivity Police on Patrol" (Op-Ed 
Page, Nov. 5), George Will displays not only his customary arrogance, but a 
great deal of ignorance as well. I strongly disagree with his labeling of 
college and university policies which discourage racism, sexism and homophobia 
as "censorship." Will forgets that one of the primary reasons one attends an 
institution of higher learning is to expand one's understanding of the world 
outside of the household and neighborhood. It is for this reason that nearly 
all four-year colleges require a core curriculum which includes courses in 
world history and literature. 
Many students come to college from sheltered backgrounds, lacking awareness of 
and sensitivity to many issues of race and gender. Is it wrong for a school to 
promote student awareness of these issues? Awareness cannot be fostered in an 
environment where intolerance and abuse are considered acceptable. 
Will wrongly proclaims that attempts to reduce overt racism and sexism are a 
liberal plot. Is it only liberals who would like to see an atmosphere of 
tolerance and understanding on our college campuses? Is it only liberals who 
feel that all college students, regardless of race, gender or sexual 
preference, should be free to pursue a course of study without fear of slurs 
being yelled when they enter a cafeteria, or school newspaper articles 
circulating derision? 
Will insults Republicans by suggesting that only liberals encourage an 
environment of tolerance in our institutions, and he insults everyone by 
implying that if we do not stand up and cheer for bigots, we are denying the 
bigots their rights.
