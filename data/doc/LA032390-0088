VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA; 
DEAL OFFERED ON NEW JAIL, ROADS 
Most property owners near a proposed site for a new county jail in Santa Paula 
would not oppose the facility if the county agreed to share the cost of 
improving area roads, a representative for the owners said Thursday. 
The spokesman, Bob Cole, said he represented a majority of about 20 property 
owners in a 160-acre industrial area off Todd Road near Briggs Road, southwest 
of Santa Paula. 
Cole said that the area is serviced by private two-lane roads with high 
commercial traffic and that property owners would be willing to cooperate with 
the county in paying for road improvements if a jail is constructed at the 
site. 
"There are certain improvements we would like put in our area, and we thought 
it would be nice if we could share those with the county," said Cole, director 
of the Santa Clara Waste Water Co. 
Cole testified on behalf of the property owners at a county environmental 
hearing on the proposed site earlier this week. Cole cited other advantages to 
a jail at the Briggs Road site, including 10-minute access to the Santa Paula 
Freeway. 
The site of a new county jail has been controversial. A county environmental 
report recommended using donated parkland east of Santa Paula for the jail. 
Other proposed sites include Pancho Road south of Camarillo, Potrero Road 
farther south and Hueneme Road east of Port Hueneme.
