FT  27 APR 93 / Banks may alter spouse liability
HIGH street banks are likely to consider changes to their code of practice
in the light of cases where individuals have been surprised by the amount of
money for which they are held responsible when their spouse's business
collapses.
The British Bankers' Association code says banks should advise individuals
asked to guarantee a loan for someone else to seek independent advice.
