WAR ARTISTS: 'QUAINT' BRITISH TRADITION 
Britain's official war artist is following his country's forces into the 
Persian Gulf armed with sketchbook and camera. 
"It is one of those quaint British traditions . . . sending artists to a war 
zone," said John Keane, whose work includes paintings of the Nicaraguan 
conflict and violence in Northern Ireland. 
Keane has received a $19,000 commission from the Imperial War Museum in London 
to go to the gulf and add to the museum's collection of 12,000 war paintings.
