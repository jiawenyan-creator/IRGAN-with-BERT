applicants. The letter should be submitted to the Grants Management Officer (whose address is reflected in section
B, ``Applications''). It should be postmarked no later than two months prior to the planned submission deadline,

investigator, and specify the priority area of violence-related injury research (i.e., youth suicide, firearm
injuries, and interpersonal youth violence) addressed by the proposed project. The letter of intent does not influence
review or funding decisions, but it will enable CDC to plan the review more efficiently, and will ensure that each applicant
receives timely and relevant information prior to application submission.
