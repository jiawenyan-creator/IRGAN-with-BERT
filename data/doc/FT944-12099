FT  03 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Union Carbide files appeal
US chemicals company Union Carbide has filed an appeal to the European Court
of Justice over the European Commission's approval of a Dollars 3bn (Pounds
1.8bn) plastics joint venture between Royal Dutch/Shell group and Italy's
Montedison. Union Carbide said in its present form the proposed venture
threatened competition in polypropylene manufacturing.
The Commission gave its go-ahead to the deal in June in spite of the fact
that Shell and Montedison have at least partial control of the two main
polypropylene manufacturing methods.
