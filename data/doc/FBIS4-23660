  [Text] In Tunis, Tanzania has said it intends to withdraw 
from the peacekeeping operation in Liberia next month because 
the United Nations has not implemented its accord with Tanzania. 
  Speaking to a nine-man ECOWAS [Economic Community of West 
African States] commission on Liberia, Tanzania's minister for 
foreign affairs, the Honorable Joseph Rwegasira, said the United 
Nations had not given Tanzania the finance to enable its troops 
in Liberia to undertake its role appropriately. Members of the 
Tanzania People's Defense Force are in Liberia for a six-month 
attachment which is due to expire next month. Rwegasira said 
the withdrawal of the Tanzanian troops from Liberia was a 
regrettable action, adding that it could not be determined in 
advance what effect the withdrawal would cause. 
  Meanwhile, Ghana and Nigeria have also threatened to pull 
out 
their peacekeeping forces from Liberia as a result of the rising 
cost of maintaining such forces in Liberia, and due to lack of 
progress in restoring peace in that country. Ghana has been 
facing a financial crisis for the last four years, in keeping 
its forces in Liberia.
