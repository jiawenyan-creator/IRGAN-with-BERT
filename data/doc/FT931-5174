TIME PRODUCTS, the UK watch and jewellery distributor, has paid Dollars 17m
(Pounds 11.9m) for the business of Judith Leiber, an American who designs
luxury handbags for the international jet-set.
Hollywood stars are among customers prepared to pay several thousand dollars
for a handbag made by Mrs Leiber, 72, who started her business 30 years ago
in New York.
A designer bag presented to Mrs Barbara Bush was valued at Dollars 1,245. It
showed a likeness of Millie, the presidential couple's pet dog.
Mrs Leiber will continue to run her company, which distributes only through
exclusive department stores and jewellers. Time Products has distributed her
handbags in the UK since 1991.
The UK company said the handbags had not been actively marketed outside
North America, and there was therefore potential for developing the brand
worldwide. There was scope for applying the name to merchandise other than
handbags, putting a broader range of products through the same
tightly-targeted distribution network.
Time Products also announced that it had paid Pounds 2m for a 5 per cent
stake in Audemars Piguet, the Swiss watchmaker which specialises in highly
technical and luxurious timepieces.
Mr Marcus Marguiles, chairman of Time Products, said: 'Judith Leiber is one
of the most highly-prized brands in North America and we are delighted to
have secured it, while our relationship with Audemars Piguet will be
strengthened by our investment.'
The Leiber business made pre-tax profits of Dollars 1m, after directors'
remunerations, on sales of Dollars 15m in the year to December 31. It had
net assets at that date of Dollars 5.1m.
Even after completing these acquisitions, Time Products has net cash of more
than Pounds 10m.
