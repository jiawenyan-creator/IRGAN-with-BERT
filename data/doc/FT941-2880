FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Float will value Nottingham at Pounds 81.4m
Nottingham Group, one of the UK's largest suppliers of educational products,
is to raise Pounds 13.6m from a flotation, which will value the company at
Pounds 81.4m.
Nottingham is to offer 24.5m shares at 155p each, of which 16.1m will be
placed firm with institutions and 8.4m will be sold through an
intermediaries offer.
The company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.3m in 1993 after a Pounds 1.1m
write-off on fixed assets. Based on earnings excluding the write-off, the
shares are being listed on an historic p/e of 14.2 and a notional yield of
4.45 per cent.
About 67 per cent of 1993 turnover was in sales to primary and secondary
schools. Nottingham hopes that utilisation of the state schools' estimated
Pounds 400m budget surplus will help fuel sales growth.
The Pounds 38m share offer is sponsored by Goldman Sachs, broker to the deal
along with James Capel. Nottingham is issuing 9m new shares, a further
600,000 will result from conversion of preference shares, while 15.5m
existing shares will also be offered.
Following flotation, the directors will control 15 per cent of Nottingham,
having sold 25 per cent, and existing institutional shareholders will own 33
per cent.
The cash raised will be used to redeem outstanding preference shares.
Dealings will begin on March 30.
COMMENT
There are no listed companies that can offer a direct comparison with
Nottingham, but on the basis of its generous dividend yield and a p/e at a
substantial discount to the market average, the shares should offer
something for the stags. The company is strongly cash generative, enabling
it to fund further small acquisitions to build up its distribution network.
This should provide some further lift for a solid but unexciting business.
