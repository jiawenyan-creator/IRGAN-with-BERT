FT  07 APR 94 / More employers report 'skills gap' in workforce
The 'skills gap' in Britain is widening again, says the employment
department's latest analysis of shortages.
The gap - defined as the difference between the skills of existing employees
and those needed to meet business objectives - was reported by 17 per cent
of employers in 1993 and only 14 per cent in 1991. The report was written by
Mr Ian Dale of the department's statistical services division.
But employers do not appear to have immediate skill-related recruitment
problems. Only 6 per cent reported hard-to-fill vacancies when asked in the
middle of last year, compared with 22 per cent in 1990.
An increasing number of hard-to-fill vacancies are in low paid, low-skill
jobs. In 1990, 40 per cent of such vacancies were defined as high-skill, but
the figure is now 28 per cent. The main industry with recruitment difficulty
is hotels and catering, in which 21 per cent of employers report problems,
followed by textiles and electrical and electronic engineering.
Last year, 10 occupations accounted for three-quarters of all hard-to-fill
vacancies: catering trades, textiles and garments, nurses and related health
professionals, sales representatives, engineers and technologists, transport
operatives, miscellaneous sales, sales assistants and checkout operators,
clerks and cashiers, teachers.
Only 5 per cent of manufacturing companies expected a lack of skilled labour
to limit output in the early months of this year compared with a peak of 28
per cent in 1988.
But the Association of British Chambers of Commerce has reported that in the
fourth quarter of 1993 42 per cent of manufacturing companies had
recruitment difficulties - the highest level since 1990 when the proportion
peaked at 73 per cent.
