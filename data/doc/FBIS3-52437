  [Text] Jerusalem denies the announcement by Abu-al-'Ala' 
[Ahmad Quray'] in Oslo that Israel and the PLO might resume the 
Taba talks within hours, our political correspondent Shlomo Raz 
reports. Abu-al-'Ala' added that no breakthrough in the 
contacts between the two sides has been achieved so far. Our 
political correspondent adds that the Taba talks will be renewed 
soon since the PLO has accepted the Israeli stand that the 
deliberations must be based on the understandings reached in 
Cairo last week, as well as on the declaration of principles. 
  Minister Yosi Sarid said in the Knesset today that while 
Israeli and PLO positions have drawn closer in the past two 
days, he can still not say that this will necessarily lead to 
the immediate resumption of the negotiations, but he hoped that 
the Taba talks would be resumed next week on the basis of the 
document approved by both sides in Cairo. 
  Minister Ya'aqov Tzur called on the government to prepare 
for 
the possibility that after the interim stage, the Palestinian 
autonomy will become an independent entity or an independent 
state. He said a security corridor, incorporating the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] camps and Jewish settlements in the 
Jordan Rift Valley, should be set up along the Jordan River, and 
it should remain under contiguous Israeli control. Minister 
Tzur said that insisting on those principles in the negotiations 
now would enable Israel to show flexibility on less substantive 
issues. Minister Tzur was addressing a meeting of the United 
Kibbutz Movement which discussed the future of the settlements 
in the Jordan Rift Valley. 
  The Ministerial Committee on National Security Affairs today 
discussed ways of dealing with the PLO's intention to set up 
extraterritorial areas in Jerusalem, such as currently exists at 
Orient House, which serves as PLO headquarters in East Jerusalem 
and comes under the control of Palestinian guards. Our 
political correspondent reports that security sources told the 
meeting that in order to prevent that happening, such moves 
should be defined as harming Israeli sovereignty and the 
relevant clauses of the Penal Code, such as the one dealing with 
treason, should be implemented
