FT  27 SEP 93 / International Company News: Italian insurer shows first-half
improvement
RIUNIONE Adriatica di Sicurta, Italy's second-biggest private insurance
group, confirmed the marked upturn in insurers' underwriting performance
with first half pre-tax profits of L246.5bn (Dollars 155m) against L110.4bn
in 1992.
Higher taxation attenuated the improvement at the net level, with an
increase to L113.4bn from L97.1bn last year. That is well above the L95bn
RAS made in the whole of 1992, when earnings were hit by a steep write-down
in its investment portfolio.
Group premiums for RAS's Italian operation and its 14 foreign subsidiaries,
not adjusted for last year's lira devaluation, rose 16.9 per cent to
L4,198bn.
RAS said earnings on both underwriting and investments had performed well.
Although the motor side, to which it is among the most heavily exposed of
Italy's insurers, continued to register underwriting losses for compulsory
third party policies, the overall claims ratio improved.
Rinascente, Italy's biggest retailing group, said pre-tax profits for the
first half rose to L25.3bn from L19.3bn, in spite of the recession, which
has depressed retail sales.
Group turnover climbed by 12.3 per cent to L2,509.9bn from L2,234.5bn, well
ahead of the 1.8 per cent increase across the Italian retailing sector.
The bulk of the rise was attributable to Rinascente's growing hypermarket
and supermarket chain, which recorded a 17.4 per cent jump in sales to
L1,636.4bn. Sales in non-food retailing reported a more contained increase
of almost 4 per cent to L873.5bn.
Rinascente said it was pushing ahead with new store openings and expected to
open one new hypermarket and a number of additional specialist outfits
before the end of the year.
