 

II. Guidelines for Cancellation of Claims for Liquidated Damages for Violation of Temporary Importation Bonds (19
CFR 10.39) 


A. Cancel the claim without payment if the breach was for the benefit of the United States. 
B. Cancel the claim upon payment of an amount equal to the merchandise processing fee that would have been due on the
merchandise had an entry for consumption been filed (but not less than $100) if: 
1. The breach was due wholly to circumstances beyond the importer's control and which could not have been reasonably
anticipated i.e., destruction by accidental fire.

2. Merchandise which was the subject of the entry would have been entitled to free entry as domestic products exported
and returned or under any other duty-free provision. 
C. If the merchandise was exported or destroyed timely but Customs was not notified in a timely manner so as to cancel
the bond, cancel the claim for liquidated damages upon payment of an amount between 1 and 5 percent of the claim (depending
on aggravating or mitigating factors present), but not less than $100. 
D. If the merchandise was exported or destroyed but outside the bond period, cancel the claim for liquidated damages
upon payment of an amount between 5 and 10 percent of the claim (depending on aggravating or mitigating factors present),
but not less than $200. 
1. Examples of aggravating factors: 
a. Importer is uncooperative, e.g., fails to provide information to Customs. 
b. A large number of violations of this type by the importer in relation to the total number of transactions engaged
in. 
c. Importer's willful disregard of or carelessness toward responsibilities under applicable statutes, regulations
or bond. 
2. Examples of mitigating factors: 
a. Importer cooperates with Customs personnel in resolution of the case.
