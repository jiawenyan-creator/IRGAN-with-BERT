  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Japan's chief economic 
planner on Friday proposed boosting spending on a 10-year public 
works investment project totaling 430 trillion yen to help 
accelerate the economic recovery. 
  "With the Japanese economy in a very important phase, now is 
the time to review the investment project," Manae Kubota, 
director general of the Economic Planning Agency, told a news 
conference. 
  Kubota said the step would help facilitate a full-fledged 
economic recovery in fiscal 1994, which starts in April, and 
enable sustainable growth in the following year. 
  On financing the expansion, Kubota said she expects higher 
revenues from tax increases if the economy is put on a smooth 
growth track. 
  The plan to spend 430 trillion yen on public projects from 
fiscal 1991 to 2000 was worked out under Japan-U.S. trade talks 
called the Structural Impediments Initiative (SII). 
  Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi supported Kubota's view, 
proposing that the government study the possibility of 
increasing outlays to 600 trillion yen, officials said. 
  Igarashi also urged the government to work out measures 
promptly to open markets other than housing and real estate, 
they said.
