  [Text] Moscow June 22 TASS -- A State Duma deputy accused 
the Russian Foreign Ministry of failing to organise the 
discussion of the Partnership for Peace [PFP] programme in the 
parliament before signing it. 
  Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma Committee for 
International Relations, told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday that the 
deputies received the text of the programme only a few hours 
before Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev signed it in 
Brussels today. 
  He said that President Boris Yeltsin recommended setting up 
working groups in the Federation Council, the upper house of 
parliament, with the participation of State Duma deputies to 
discuss the programme. However the Foreign Ministry had failed 
to arrange such discussions. "That's not the way for 
democratically minded people to treat the parliament," Lukin 
said.
