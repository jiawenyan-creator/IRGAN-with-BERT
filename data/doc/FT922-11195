FT  27 APR 92 / Plants give clue to preservation
A CAMBRIDGE scientist claims to have discovered a means of preserving food
and medicines by mimicking the ability of some plants to survive years of
drought.
Mr Bruce Roser found that drought-resistant plants owed their abilities to a
molecule called trehalose. Experiments showed that adding trehalose to a
range of compounds enabled them to be dried out completely and then restored
at will.
Trehalose works by maintaining the shape of molecules and preventing damage
after their water content is removed, Mr Roser said. 'It embalms them like
amber traps insects.'
Quadrant, a company that he set up to develop his findings commercially, is
negotiating with two Japanese food companies.
Mr Roser and his colleagues also claim to have discovered the gene that
instructs cells to produce trehalose naturally, opening the prospect of
creating new varieties of drought-proof wheat and other types of crop.
