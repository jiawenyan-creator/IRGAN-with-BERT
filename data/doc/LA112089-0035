RASH OF DISMISSALS VOIDS BIAS CLAIMS 
The Supreme Court decision last June that sharply restricted the reach of a 
major civil rights law has resulted in the dismissal of 96 race discrimination 
claims, nearly one every business day since the opinion was issued, a study 
released Sunday by a civil rights group says. 
The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund reviewed court actions between 
June 15, the date of the Supreme Court's decision in Patterson vs. McLean 
Credit Union, and Nov. 1. 
Judges, acting on their own or at the request of those being sued, dismissed 96 
discrimination claims in 50 cases as a result of the Patterson decision, the 
study by the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People found. 
In Patterson, the court said an 1866 civil rights law that prohibits race 
discrimination in the making of a contract -- known as section 1981 -- "extends 
only to the formation of a contract but not to problems that may arise later."
