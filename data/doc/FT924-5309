FT  27 NOV 92 / Technology: Toadstools turn on fungi friends - Worth
Watching
An extract of toadstool has been adapted by ICI Agrochemicals, of Haslemere,
Surrey, to attack its nearest and dearest - fungi. The broad spectrum
fungicide should be most effective on cereals, vines and rice.
ICIA5504 has been developed from the strobilurins and oudemansins found in
toadstools. Unlike traditional fungicides, the chemical penetrates the
fungal spores and mycelium and blocks the energy-producing processes needed
for growth. This means fungi have built up no resistance to the chemical.
