FT  01 AUG 92 / Letter: Environment has its own agenda
Sir, David Neckar (Letters, July 30) makes half a point when he asserts that
American asbestosis and environmental pollution claims are eating away at
the foundations of the Lloyd's market. But to withdraw from America is to
stick one's head in the sand.
There is nothing peculiar to America (nor, for that matter, Lloyd's) about
these claims. It is merely that they hit America earlier than they do here
because the legislation was brought in earlier in America.
Worldwide, the environmental movement is riding a high tide of public
opinion. It is not responsible to anything other than its own agenda. It
pays no attention to the costs of its own campaigns. One of these may be a
viable insurance industry.
It is about time people woke up to the fact that environmentalism is not a
free lunch.
