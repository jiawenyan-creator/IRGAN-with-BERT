FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Pensions side lifts Britannic Assurance
Britannic Assurance yesterday announced an interim dividend increased from
9.2p to 10.3p and significant growth in premium income for the first six
months of this year.
In line with the rest of the industry, pensions registered the strongest
results, boosted by rising unemployment as people made redundant transferred
their pension funds.
The ordinary branch's with-profits pension business rose 60 per cent to
Pounds 57.8m (Pounds 36m). New business in unit-linked pensions more than
doubled, to Pounds 6.81m (Pounds 3.29m).
Ordinary branch life assurance premiums were up almost 20 per cent to Pounds
41.8m (Pounds 34.9m), helped by the company's single-premium with-profits
bond.
Elsewhere, industrial branch assurance new business rose from Pounds 58m to
Pounds 60.7m. General branch premium income improved to Pounds 15.1m (Pounds
13.1m) and the underwriting loss was cut from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 2.3m.
Britannic also announced reductions of between 1 and 2 per cent in the
terminal bonuses payable on 10-year and 15-year with-profits products. Mr
Brian Shaw, general manager and actuary, attributed this to the sluggish
markets this year.
