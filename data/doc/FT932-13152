FT  24 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson bid talk lifts UB
A RAPID 25-point turnaround in the share price of United Biscuits ignited
renewed takeover speculation, with conglomerate Hanson emerging as the
favourite potential predator. Others mentioned included Cadbury-Schweppes
and US outfits Philip Morris and Campbell Soups. But it was the acquisitive
Hanson that sparked most dealers' interests, although food manufacturing
specialists remained sceptical.
Before the rumours, UB shares had spent most of the session drifting back
with the market, the shares settling 9 off around 3pm. However, as the
takeover talk gained currency the shares spurted forward, putting on 25
points in just half an hour. Marketmakers said excitement was further
generated by much of the business being transacted through the IDB network,
the inter-dealer broker system which guarantees anonymity for both buyers
and sellers and excludes brokers. Options activity was also reported. The
shares closed 14 ahead at 399p in turnover of 2.4m.
Such was the strength of the rumour that some dealers were confidentially
predicting a Monday morning bid of 650p a share, valuing UB at over Pounds
3bn. The accompanying rights issue such a huge takeover would require
satisfied the equation for the market that a major bid has been in the
offing in recent weeks.
Earlier this week, Cadbury shares were hit on rights issue fears as it
talked to analysts about making acquisitions. However, food analysts derided
a Cadbury bid, arguing that the confectionery group already had a firm
strategy away from the snack food business.
Hanson's name also brought scepticism, with specialists suggesting UB's
asset value - which some put at under 200p - would mean a large premium for
goodwill, not a noted Hanson speciality. The potential US bidders were
largely discounted on finance raising grounds. Hanson shares declined 3 1/2
to 238p. Cadbury-Schweppes lost 3 to 479p.
