FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Aker profits cut to NKr41m
Aker, the Norwegian cement, building materials and oil and gas technology
group, yesterday reported four-month pre-tax profits had more than halved to
NKr41m (Dollars 5.7m) from NKr87m in the same period last year.
The fall was due mainly to the positive effect of exceptional items on 1993
figures.
The 1993 result was lifted by exceptional items of NKr112m. If this was
excluded, the pre-tax profit for the period would have been NKr66m.
Group sales were reduced by NKr294m to NKr5.28bn as operating profits fell
to NKr87m from NKr135m.
Aker blamed the fall in sales on a lower level of activity in the oil and
gas technology division.
The cement and building materials division plunged to a pre-tax loss of
NKr58m from a profit of NKr30m last year, as sales rose by NKr69m to
NKr1.75bn.
Aker said that the domestic construction and civil engineering market had
begun to show growth, activity in the UK was on the rise and there was
continued high activity in the international cement business.
The oil and gas technology division lifted pre-tax profit to NKr128m from
NKr105m, as sales dipped to NKr3.32bn from NKr3.66bn.
Aker warned that a continuing low oil price and postponement of development
projects was limiting development activity. The division had an order
reserve of NKr8.6bn at end-April, against NKr10bn at the end of 1993.
Norske Skog, the Norwegian pulp, paper and building materials producer,
reported four-month pre-tax losses narrowed to NKr63m (Dollars 8.75m) from
NKr92m in the same period last year. It forecast an improved result for the
year.
The group said demand for main products - pulp, printing paper, sawn timber
and board - had picked up and prices had firmed in western Europe and North
America as capacity utilisation rose.
Group sales increased by NKr346m to NKr2.71bn, but the advance was partly
offset by a rise of NKr205m to NKr2.4bn in operating expenses.
However, Norske Skog swung to an operating profit of NKr114m from a loss of
NKr20m last year.
The group cut losses in associated companies by nearly half to NKr28m,
mainly reflecting high productivity at Papeteries de Golbey's in France and
lower prices for waste paper, which meets about half of the mill's raw
materials needs.
