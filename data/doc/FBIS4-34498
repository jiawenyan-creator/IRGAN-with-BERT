  [Text] On 18 June, Judge Emile Jonassaint's provisional 
government declared some of the nation's strategic zones to be 
emergency zones, within the framework of the state of emergency. 
  The Haitian-Dominican border is just one of those zones. The 
decree indicates that the innersea [not further specified] and 
Haiti's coastline are considered strategic zones, with limited 
access to Haitians and foreigners. Power stations, radio 
antenna, and telecommunications sites are also declared 
strategic zones, whose access is subject to security conditions 
established by concerned authorities. The use of photographic 
and filming devices and of radio communications is also subject 
to special authorization by the concerned administrative 
authorities in those strategic zones. 
  In addition, the government decree stressed that the latest 
international sanctions against Haiti constitute a blatant 
violation of human rights and are similar to genocide and that 
increased sanctions could provoke a fratricidal war in the 
country.
