FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Norwegian insurer suffers steep
fall
Vital, the Norwegian life insurance and pension group, suffered a fall in
first-quarter pre-tax profits to NKr63m (dollars8.7m) from NKr812m, writes
Karen Fossli in Oslo.
Profits were hit by a reduction in the value of the group's bond portfolio
following a rise in interest rates.
