FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Momentum Life and RMB in joint
venture
MOMENTUM Life, South Africa's fifth largest life insurance company, and Rand
Merchant Bank (RMB), one of the three main merchant banks, have joined
forces to create an independent financial services group.
The deal will create a group with assets of over R10bn (Dollars 3.57bn) and
a market value of about R750m. It will be independent of all the main large
life offices and conglomerates which dominate the South African financial
services sector.
Ultimate control will rest with the directors and management of the RMB
group who control RMB Holdings, parent company of RMB.
The deal brings together a relatively young life office  - Momentum is 25
years old  - that has grown mainly by acquisition, and a merchant bank
renowned for its aggression in the market.
