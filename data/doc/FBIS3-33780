  [Text] With a majority of Labor ministers against the 
Meretz ministers and Minister Hayim Ramon, the government today 
decided to withdraw the original national health insurance bill 
from the Knesset and return it for deliberations in the Knesset 
House Committee. At the request of Minister Amnon Rubinstein 
the government did not deal today with the two clauses that 
pertain to the Histadrut Labor Federation and the collection of 
taxes, but will do so in its next session. 
  Health Minister Hayim Ramon told our correspondent Hayim 
Hecht that in view of the government's decision he is determined 
to resign and will submit his letter of resignation at the 
opening of the cabinet session next Sunday. Minister Ramon said 
that in his private meeting with the prime minister prior to the 
cabinet session he informed Rabin of his plans, and in his 
opinion there is no personal rift between Yitzhaq Rabin and 
himself. 
  Our correspondent notes that during the cabinet session 
sharp 
words were exchanged between some of the ministers and Ramon. 
Minister Tzur accused Ramon of being a spoiled boy. Ramon said 
in return that the ministers who went back on their support for 
the bill caused severe damage to the Labor Party. 
  In today's cabinet session, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
expressed great appreciation for Ramon's performance as health 
minister. He said the bill's amended version is not an 
expression of ideology, rather a necessary compromise between 
what is desirable and what is attainable. He emphasized, at the 
same time, that the bill retains its two most important 
principles: it covers all the citizens of Israel, and payment 
will be determined on the basis of salaries.
