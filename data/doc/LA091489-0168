NCAA TIP SENT ELLIS RUNNIN' TO SYRACUSE, REPORT SAYS 
Former Kentucky star LeRon Ellis decided to attend Syracuse University rather 
than the University of Nevada Las Vegas because he was alerted to the NCAA's 
investigation of the Runnin' Rebels basketball program, according to a report 
published Wednesday. 
Ellis, a former standout at Mater Dei High School, told the Syracuse 
Herald-Journal that he spoke with "a couple" of National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. investigators during the governing body's probe into the Kentucky program 
who told him about the NCAA's review of the UNLV program. 
The 6-foot-11 Ellis announced July 17 that he was transferring to Syracuse from 
Kentucky, which has received three years probation for recruiting violations. 
Because of the NCAA penalty, Ellis is immediately available to play at 
Syracuse. 
Earlier in the summer, Ellis had said that UNLV was his first choice. The 
school announced July 21 that it was under investigation by the NCAA concerning 
the recruiting of former New York City player Lloyd Daniels. 
Ellis said he questioned the NCAA investigators about UNLV's future and was 
told the Rebels might be headed for the same punishment as Kentucky. That 
conversation caused him to change his mind, he said. 
"That's the only reason I changed my mind. The only reason," he said. 
UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian told the newspaper that he had heard nothing of 
Ellis' contact with the NCAA, but that he had wondered why Ellis changed his 
mind. 
"He committed to us verbally. We were really shocked when there was a 
turnaround," Tarkanian said. 
Spokesman Jim Marchiony said the NCAA allows investigators to speak to recruits 
if the school in question has been notified of a pending investigation.
