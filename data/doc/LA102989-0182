THE WEEK AHEAD: A LOOK AT UPCOMING EVENTS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY 
SAVE A LIFE -- The Walnut Valley Chamber of Commerce is sponsoring a Halloween 
masquerade party Monday from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. with a difference: The $25 
admission fee will defray the cost of locating bone marrow donors for two 
teen-agers dying of leukemia. The party will be held at the Pomona Valley 
Mining Co. 
TRICK OR TREAT -- An estimated 300 police officers have been assigned to cover 
the annual Halloween Parade Tuesday on Hollywood Boulevard in an effort to 
avoid a repetition of last year's riot. 
POLICE COVERUP -- Lawyers for the city of Torrance will appear in Los Angeles 
Superior Court Tuesday to ask Judge Abby Soven to overturn a $6-million award 
to a San Pedro family last month. The jury found Police Chief Donald Nash and 
five officers responsible for covering up for the possible drunk driving of a 
colleague involved in a fatal 1984 traffic accident. 
MONEY WOES -- Additional Compton city workers may face layoffs after a City 
Council workshop scheduled for Tuesday to discuss the city's financial 
problems. About 85 city workers were laid off in July.
