THE WORLD; 
POLISH WAR DEAD FOUND 
The bodies of 3,311 World War II Polish officers and soldiers were found in 
five mass graves in the Lithuanian village of Kalety, Polish television 
reported. The report quoted people who claimed to be witnesses as saying the 
victims were shot by Soviet troops. It did not say how or when the graves were 
discovered. More than 15,000 Polish officers were interned in three Soviet 
camps in the Ukraine during World War II and subsequently disappeared. In 1943, 
Nazi Germany, which overran Soviet territory, announced the discovery of a mass 
grave of 4,250 Polish officers in the Katyn Forest, near Smolensk in the 
Ukraine.
