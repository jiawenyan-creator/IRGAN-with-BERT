Reflection": "High-Altitude High-Speed Reconnaissance Aircraft"] 
  [Text] The need for the guaranteed receipt of 
reconnaissance information in depth on enemy territory covered 
by powerful contemporary PVO [air-defense] systems forced the 
aviation designers in the USSR and the United States, in the 
second half of the 1950s, to turn to the idea of creating 
high-speed and high-altitude aircraft that combined good flight 
performance characteristics with reduced radar detectability. 
The American series-produced Lockheed SR-71 and the Soviet 
experimental RSR were such aircraft.

presence of a braking chute was planned. 
  The airframe skin was made of D-16T and D-20 aluminum alloys 
and aluminum-beryllium alloy. 
  Additional information. Vigorous and extremely 
successful work was launched in the USSR in the 1950s on 
high-speed, high-altitude aircraft in various classes. The OKBs 
of S. Lavochkin and V. Myasishchev were creating the Burya and 
Buran unmanned cruise aircraft, designed for intercontinental 
flight and equipped with cruising PVRDs [ramjet engines] with 
acceleration to cruising speed of Mach 3 in a vertical launch 
from the ground using liquid-fueled rocket booster engines. Work 
was underway on similar topics at other OKBs as well. 
  The development of a plan for a manned, supersonic 
long-range 
bomber and jet-powered reconnaissance aircraft was underway at 
OKB-256 starting in 1955 under the leadership of P. Tsybin. The 
distinctive features of the design were the use of an air launch 
from a Tu-95N launch-platform aircraft, with subsequent 
acceleration to a cruising speed of 3,000 km/hr using two paired 
liquid-fueled booster engines and a cruising flight using two 
PVRDs. The total design range of the reconnaissance aircraft was 
12,500--13,500 km. A preliminary design of the aircraft was 
prepared in January 1956, but in 1957 the work on the 
reconnaissance aircraft was halted (one reason was the 
impossibility of achieving the design bomb load, which was a 
high-yield thermonuclear bomb). 
  The OKB-256, simultaneously with the start of work on the 
reconnaissance aircraft, prepared a proposal for the creation of 
a supersonic jet reconnaissance aircraft to conduct operational 
reconnaissance in a theater and the enemy rear. 
  A government decree was issued on 31 August 1956 for the 
creation of a high-altitude, high-speed reconnaissance aircraft, 
and on 15 January 1957 the TTT [technical-performance 
requirements] for an aircraft that received the designation RSR 
were issued. 
  The RSR, according to them, was to be the first manned 
aircraft in the world with a supersonic cruising speed. It could 
reach almost three times the speed of sound at an altitude of 
25.5 km over a target. The preliminary design for the RSR 
reconnaissance aircraft that was completed on 26 June 1957 
confirmed the practicability of achieving the design 
characteristics. The RSR could climb to an altitude of 20 km 15 
minutes after takeoff. 
  It was expected that the aircraft would pass the speed of 
sound at an altitude of 8.5 km four minutes after takeoff. The 
jettisoning of the external fuel tanks was planned at an 
altitude of 10.7 km at a speed of 420 meters/second, and after a 
gain in altitude prolonged flight would occur at high supersonic 
speeds. 
  The RSR was to maintain radio and radar silence during the 
flight. Attention was devoted during its creation to providing 
for a small radar signature through the use of the appropriate 
shapes for the airframe surfaces and the use of radio-absorbing 
skin coatings (one of the first attempts at reducing radar 
detectability). The execution of a brief maneuver with G-forces 
up to 2.5 was also envisaged in order to evade missiles (a zoom 
with a dynamic ceiling of 42 km), along with the use of active 
and passive jamming. 
  A manned analogue aircraft, the NM-1, was built to try out 
the design and on-board systems of the RSR; it was fitted with 
two AM-5 TRDs [turbojet engines] (2 x 2,000 kgf) and had a 
takeoff mass of nine tonnes, length of 26.5 meters and wingspan 
of 7.71 meters. The landing gear of the NM-1 had a main support 
in the form of a skid in the central part of the fuselage, and a 
takeoff trolley with two wheels that was attached to the skid. 
The first flight took place on 7 April 1959 (the test pilot was 
Amet-Khan Sultan). More than ten flights were made by the NM-1 
in all. 
  Despite the fact that the manufacture of a pilot series of 
five RSR aircraft was organized at a plant in Ulan-Ude and the 
possibility of assembling it at the Plant imeni Khrunichev in 
Moscow was studied, the OKB-256 was closed by decision of N. 
Khrushchev, and the work on the aircraft was transferred first 
to the OKB-23 of V. Myasishchev, and then to OKB-52 of V. 
Chelomey, where it was "happily" put to rest, being in 
contradiction with the principal projects of OKB-52. The series 
of RSR aircraft was actually manufactured, in the recollection 
of test pilot V. Pazhitnyy, who was working at the plant in 
Ulan-Ude at the end of the 1950s and beginning of the 1960s, but 
the delivery of engines was held up when the plant management 
received a directive to shut down the program and cut up the 
aircraft. The workers refused to destroy the fruits of own labor 
with their own hands. The management "displayed flexibility," 
and the aircraft were mothballed; three or four years later they 
were quietly taken away for scrap.

km[.sup]2[/] in one hour from an altitude of 24,400 meters) 
and conventional image reconnaissance over the battlefield; 
electro-optic (ELINT) and radio (COMINT) reconnaissance gear, 
including infrared and laser systems, short-focal-length 
panorama aerial cameras with focal length of 610 mm, long-focus 
aerial camera for lateral perspective pictures (LOROP type, lens 
with focal length of 1,680 mm, resolution of 76 cm at a range of 
96 km), EW system and aerial refueling using a telescoping boom. 
  Status. Series-produced in 1966-67 (32 aircraft 
were built, including trainers). There were two air wings with 
nine SR-71A/B aircraft each in the Strategic Air Command by the 
beginning of 1989. The decision was made to remove the aircraft 
from service that same year. The sole flying model of the SR-71A 
at the beginning of 1992 was being operated by NASA as a flying 
laboratory. 
  Additional information. Work began at the end of 
the 1950s on the creation of a new strategic reconnaissance 
aircraft intended to replace the Lockheed U-2. The principal 
requirements were for a high ceiling and high cruising speed 
(Mach 4). Since the interception of such a target was possible 
only using radar, the necessity naturally arose of reducing the 
aircraft's radar signature without altering the altitude and 
speed characteristics. 
  The firms of General Dynamics (a design for a small aircraft 
manufactured with the partial use of ceramics, fitted with PVRDs 
and launched from the air by a B-58 launch platform) and 
Lockheed, which under the leadership of K. Johnson had developed 
a design for an aircraft with a delta wing and two PVRDs, took 
part in the competition to create the new reconnaissance 
aircraft. Lockheed proposed reducing the aircraft's radar 
signature through the appropriate shape of the airframe, with 
smooth junctions between the wing and fuselage and a twin-tailed 
empennage tilted inward (the design also projected the use of 
radar-absorbing materials, but the lack of a suitable means of 
calculating the radar signatures of aircraft in the 1950s did 
not allow them to achieve any substantial reduction in radar 
detectability). 
  Lockheed was deemed the winner of the competition, and in 
1959 it was given a contract to develop the new aircraft. A 
variation of the F-12A fighter was created at the same time 
(obviously the U.S. Air Force command had a certain amount of 
unease at the time regarding the successes of the USSR in 
creating supersonic strategic aircraft). The flight of the first 
experimental F-12A took place on 26 April 1962, while the 
official demonstration for the press of this previously secret 
aircraft was organized on 1 October 1964. 
  The first flight of the reconnaissance aircraft that 
received 
the designation SR-71A took place on 22 December 1964; it went 
into series production (start of delivery in 1966) and was 
widely employed in the interests of the CIA and the U.S. Air 
Force for more than 20 years.
