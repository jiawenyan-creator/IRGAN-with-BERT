  [Text] Washington, April 20 (XINHUA) -- President Bill 
Clinton announced today U.S. support for extending the so-called 
"Sarajevo model" to other Muslim "safe areas" in Bosnia and 
tougher sanctions against the Serbian republic. 
  Describing the Bosnian Serbs as "complete aggressors in the 
case of Gorazde," one of the six "safe areas" designated by the 
U.N. for the Bosnian Muslims, Clinton said the Serbs should pay 
a higher price for continued violence. 
  In addition, Clinton also called for stepped-up diplomatic 
efforts for a negotiated settlement to the two-year Balkan war. 
  He welcomed the reported release of all U.N. personnel held 
by the Bosnian Serbs as hostages. 
  Clinton, who telephoned Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 
French leader Francois Mitterrand earlier in the day, refrained 
from disclosing details of what he called the "major diplomatic 
initiatives." 
  He said he felt good about his conversations with Yeltsin 
but 
ducked the question of whether Yeltsin raised any objections to 
the wider use of threatened NATO air power, saying only he 
thought Yeltsin was "sympathetic to the idea." 
  The U.S. suggestion for extending "Sarajevo Model" has yet 
to 
be approved by the 16-member NATO alliance.
