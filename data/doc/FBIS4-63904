  [Text] Moscow May 25 -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
signed a decree today approving the federal programme for the 
strengthening of the struggle against crime for 1994-1995 which 
was earlier adopted by the security council. 
  The implementation of this programme envisages consolidation 
of efforts by the law enforcement bodies, state institutions and 
society as a whole, a spokesman for the press service of the 
security council of the Russian Federation told ITAR-TASS on 
Wednesday. 
  The document approved by the president provides for the 
unification of economic, political, legal, educational and 
organisational measures aimed at combining the interests of an 
individual citizen and society. 
  The top priority direction in the struggle against crime is 
the establishment of corresponding legislative, and 
organisational and legal foundations, measures for the 
prevention of crime, and stopping crimes against life, health 
and property of citizens. 
  Special attention is paid to checking malfeasance, economic 
and organised crime, and offenses in the armed forces of the 
Russian Federation.
