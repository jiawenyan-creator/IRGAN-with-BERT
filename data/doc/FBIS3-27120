  [Text] Beijing, February 16 (XINHUA) -- The United Nations 
World Food Program (WFP) has decided to offer a total of 13.2 
million U.S. dollars of free economic aid to an agricultural 
project in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in north-west China. 
  The WFP representative in China and an official of the 
Chinese Ministry of Agriculture today signed detailed papers 
here on the project. 
  The five-year project involves comprehensive agricultural 
development in three counties of Guyuan Prefecture of Ningxia to 
thoroughly improve the local natural environment and the 
conditions for local people's life and work. 
  The prefecture is renowned for its poverty and backwardness 
because of serious soil erosion there. 
  The project will cover an area of 127,000 hectares and a 
population of 175,000 people. The total investment will reach 
21.9 million U.S. dollars. The WFP will provide 13.2 million 
U.S. dollars, and the rest will come from the Chinese Government. 
  This is the 55th free-aid project granted by the WFP to 
China. So far, the WFP has agreed to supply a total of 700 
million U.S. dollars of aid to China's agricultural development 
projects.
