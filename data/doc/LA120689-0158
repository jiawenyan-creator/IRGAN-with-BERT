REDD FOXX OWES IRS $996,630 
Comedian Redd Foxx earned more than $1 million in an 18-month period ending in 
June, yet owes the Internal Revenue Service $996,630, according to an affidavit 
released in federal court. 
The affidavit said IRS agents who swooped down on Foxx's home Nov. 28 found 
$12,769 in cash and a dozen guns, including a semiautomatic pistol. 
The affidavit, released Tuesday, lists more than 300 items which were taken in 
the raid. 
The affidavit said Foxx received in excess of $1 million from Jan. 1, 1988, 
until June 30, 1989. 
Meanwhile, Foxx said the groups Santana and The Who have sent him money to help 
cover his tax debts. 
Publicists for the two groups denied that they had given Foxx any money.
