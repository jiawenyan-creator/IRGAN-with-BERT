DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'CHEERS' ACTOR FINISHES HIGHWAY CLEANUP DUTY 
"Cheers" star Kelsey Grammer has completed a 10-day stint of picking up trash 
and pulling weeds along local highways as punishment for failing to attend a 
court-ordered alcohol abuse program. 
Grammer, 35, of Van Nuys, who plays Dr. Frasier Crane on the popular NBC 
television series, has spent two weeks in jail and must complete an alcohol 
education program by Aug. 23. 
He was sentenced to jail and ordered to do the Caltrans work and take the 
alcohol course by Van Nuys Municipal Court Commissioner Patricia Gorner 
Schwartz. 
Schwartz said Grammer had violated probation because he did not attend the 
alcohol program ordered as a condition of probation for a 1987 drunk-driving 
arrest in Van Nuys, to which Grammer pleaded no contest. 
Grammer was sentenced to 30 days in jail but was released early because of jail 
overcrowding. 
He is due back in Van Nuys Superior Court on Aug. 6 on a cocaine-possession 
charge. Grammer was ordered to stand trial on the charge after he failed to 
attend a court-ordered drug-abuse program stemming from a cocaine arrest. 
If convicted, Grammer faces a jail term of up to three years on the cocaine 
offense.
