P.M. BRIEFING; 
JOBLESS E. GERMANS SEEKING AID 
East Germany today began accepting applications for unemployment benefits for 
the first time in the Communist nation's 40-year history. 
Unofficial estimates contend that 70,000 East Germans are unemployed, but Labor 
Ministry spokesman Joachim Guenter said the number of applicants is far lower 
than had been expected. Authorities had speculated that about 4,000 people 
would seek the new insurance. 
While the number of unemployed is relatively low among East Germany's 9 million 
workers, the figure is expected to shoot up to as much as 15% after competitive 
Western practices are introduced.
