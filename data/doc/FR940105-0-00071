from the income tax refunds of persons owing money to EPA provided certain conditions are met. This rule establishes
procedures to be followed by EPA in requesting the IRS to offset tax refunds due to taxpayers who have past-due legally
enforceable debt obligations to the EPA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This interim rule provides procedures for EPA to refer past-due legally enforceable debts to the IRS for offset against
the income tax refunds of persons owing debts to EPA. This rule is authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3720A, the purpose of which
is to improve the ability of the government to collect money owed it while adding certain notice requirements and other
protections applicable to the government's relationship to the debtor. 


This rule implements 31 U.S.C. 3720A, which directs any Federal agency that is owed a past-due legally enforceable
debt by a named person to notify the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with regulations issued by the Department
of the Treasury at 26 CFR 301.64026. Before a Federal agency may give such notice, however, it must first: 
(1) Notify the debtor that the agency proposes to refer the debt for a tax refund deduction; 
(2) Give the debtor 60 days from the date of the notification to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due
or legally enforceable; 
(3) Consider any evidence presented by the debtor and determine whether any amount of such debt is past-due and legally
enforceable; and 
(4) Satisfy such other conditions as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe to ensure that the agency's determination
is valid and that the agency has made reasonable efforts to obtain payment of the debt. 
This rule, in accordance with IRS regulations, provides that before EPA refers a debt to Treasury (through IRS), a
notice of intention (Notice of Intent) will be sent to the debtor. This Notice of Intent will inform the debtor of the
amount of the debt and that unless the debt is repaid within 60 days from the date of EPA's Notice of Intent, EPA intends
to collect the debt by requesting the IRS to offset any tax refund payable to the debtor. In addition, the Notice of Intent
will state that the debtor has a right, during such period, to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due
or legally enforceable. This rule also establishes procedures for the debtor to present such evidence.
