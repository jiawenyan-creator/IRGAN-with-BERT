<DOCTITLE>Northeast Nuclear Energy Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>




The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR65, issued to Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO/the licensee), for operation of the
Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 2, located in New London County, Connecticut.

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) by adding a footnote to Surveillance Requirement
(SR) 4.6.1.2.d that defers the performance of Type B and C containment leak rate tests to the end of the twelfth refueling
outage.

On September 24, 1994, NNECO requested the NRC to exercise its discretion not to enforce compliance with the required
actions for Millstone Unit 2 Limiting Conditions for Operations (LCOs) 3.6.1.1 and 3.6.1.2 for the remainder of Cycle
12 operations. The enforcement discretion would permit NNECO to operate Millstone Unit 2 while the proposed amendment
is being processed. Millstone Unit 2 was scheduled to begin its refueling outage on October 1, and to enter Mode 5 on
October 3, 1994. On September 23, 1994, NNECO discovered that Type B and C containment leak rate tests for certain containment
penetrations had not been performed within the 24 months as required by SR 4.6.1.2.d. The specific Action Statement
for LCO 3.6.1.2. applies and requires that containment integrity to be restored within 1 hour or place the plant in
hot standby within the next 6 hours, and in cold shutdown within the following 30 hours. Since SR 4.6.1.2.d was inadvertently
missed, SR 4.0.3 was invoked at approximately 1 p.m. on September 23, 1994. This SR permits the action requirements
to be delayed for up to 24 hours to permit the completion of a missed surveillance when the allowable outage time limits
of the action requirements are less than 24 hours. Since the Type C test cannot be performed while at power and the Type
B tests that have exceeded the 24-month period cannot be completed within the 24-hour window, Millstone Unit 2 would
have been forced to shutdown to comply with the requirements of the Millstone Unit 2 TS.

The NRC staff granted orally on September 24, 1994, NNECO's request for enforcement discretion associated with Action
Statements of LCOs 3.6.1.1. and 3.6.1.2. to be effective until the proposed amendment would be issued. This enforcement
discretion was confirmed by the NRC letter to NNECO dates September 30, 1994.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendment to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue
of no significant hazards (SHC) consideration, which is presented below:

The proposed changes do not involve a SHC because the changes would not:




1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.

The proposed change to Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.2.d of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications
will extend the frequency for the Type B and C tests that were due between June 2 and September 1, 1994, to the end of the
twelfth refueling outage. This change will allow Millstone Unit No. 2 to continue to operate until the plant conducts
an orderly shutdown for the next refueling outage. This proposal does not modify the maximum allowable leakage rate
at the calculated peak containment pressure, does not impact the design basis of the containment, and does not change
the post-accident containment response.

On February 8, 1988, NNECO conducted the first Type A test for the Millstone Unit No. 2 present 10-year service period.
The test passed the ``As-Found'' and ``As-Left'' ILRTs. The ``As-Found'' leakage result was 0.201 weight percent
per day and the ``As-Left'' leakage result was 0.138 weight percent per day. These values represent 53.6% of 36.8%
of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specification Limit of 0.75 L

a

 (0.375 weight percent per day, based on an L

a

 equal to 0.5 weight percent per day), respectively. The second Type A test for the present 10-year service period was
conducted on December 24, 1992. The ``As-Found'' and ``As-Left'' ILRT results were 0.2809 and 0.2577 weight percent
per day, respectively. This values represent 74.9% and 68.7% of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specification
limit of 0.75L

a

 (0.375 weight percent per day, based on an L

a

 equal to 0.5 weight percent per day). In addition, as of December 1992, the total Type B and C ``As-Found'' and ``As-Left''
leakage results were 0.049 and 0.008 weight percent per day, respectively. These values represent 16.3% and 2.7%
of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specification limit of 0.6 L

a

 (0.3 weight percent per day, based on an L

a

 equal to 0.5 weight percent per day), respectively. The results of these tests demonstrate that Millstone Unit No.
2 has maintained control of containment integrity by maintaining a conservative margin between the acceptance criterion
and the ``As-Found'' and ``As-Left'' leakage rates.

During the past two refueling outages, there have been few failures of penetrations/values to pass their LLRTs. During
the 1992 and 1990 refueling outages, there were a total of five failures (four in 1992 and one in 1990) of penetrations/valves
to pass their LLRTs. Of these failures, only one (penetration 23/72 with valves MS191B and MS220B) was
a repeat failure. This penetration was tested successfully approximately five months ago.

During Cycle 12, maintenance has been performed on several penetrations/valves. Their operability has been assured
by the performance of post-maintenance LLRTs which demonstrated that the leakage from the penetrations/valves
were within their acceptance criteria.

Additionally, the 48 Type B penetrations (electrical) and 21 Type C penetrations (valves) that are currently outside
of the 24 month interval have each passed their last two ``As-Found'' tests, as a minimum. These results indicate that
the penetration/valves are reliable.

Based on the above, the proposed change to Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.2.d of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical
Specifications does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
analyzed.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

The proposed change to Surveillance Requirement 4.6.2.1.d of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications
will extend the frequency for the Type B and C tests that were due between June 2 and September 1, 1994, to the end of the
twelfth refueling outage. This change will allow Millstone Unit No. 2 to continue to operate until the plant conducts
an orderly shutdown for the next refueling outage. This proposal does not make any physical or operational changes
to existing plant structures, systems, or components, does not modify the maximum allowable leakage rate at the calculated
peak containment pressure, does not impact the design basis of the containment, and does not change the post-accident
containment response.

In addition, the proposed changes do not modify the acceptance criteria for the Type A, B, or C tests. Maintaining the
leakage through the containment boundary to the atmosphere within a specific value ensures that the plant complies
with the requirements of 10CFR100. The containment boundary serves as an accident mitigator; it is not an accident
initiator.

Based on the above, the proposed change to Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.2.d of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical
Specifications does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
