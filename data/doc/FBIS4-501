  [Text] The African National Congress has warned members of 
the South African Police not to embark on a proposed strike in 
two weeks' time. ANC spokesman Pravin Gordhan said the police 
should not become participants in disrupting and sabotaging the 
elections. He said they should instead become part of the 
process of protecting the election to ensure it was free and 
fair.
