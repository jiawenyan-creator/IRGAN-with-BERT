FT  29 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: EC in insurance rule move
The European Commission has dismissed newspaper reports that recent European
Union rules on insurance companies' solvency requirements could harm the
Dollars 1,500bn eurobond market, Reuters reports.
According to the reports, insurance companies could lose their ability to
own eurobonds because a EU directive prohibits securities not traded in
regulated markets to amount to more than 10 per cent of assets qualifying
for the purpose of meeting solvency rules.
But a Commission spokeswoman said the rules allowed EU countries to classify
Eurobonds as securities 'susceptible to be traded' in EU exchanges.
The International Securities Market Association, the non-regulated market's
body, agreed with the Commission's interpretation and said that the problem
noticed in Britain could be solved.
