  [Summary from poor reception] "Reports emerging from 
Baghdad" have said that something is wrong with "the dictator of 
Iraq Saddam Husayn." He has not appeared in public for some 
time. "The tyrant might be afflicted with a dangerous disease 
that has forced him to be confined to his bed. A group of 
doctors is attempting to cure him of fits of (?madness). 
Citizens have noticed that Baghdad Television is showing shots 
of old occasions, which has raised doubts about what is 
happening to the tyrant recently."
