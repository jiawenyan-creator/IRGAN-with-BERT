FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: AHP offshoot buys German drugs
group
AMERICAN Home Products has bought an east German pharmaceuticals company,
Leipziger Arzneimittelwerk (LAW).
The Treuhandanstalt, the German agency charged with privatising the east's
old state-owned enterprises, said AHP's Wyeth Pharma offshoot was chosen
mainly because it wanted to keep LAW as a self-contained subsidiary in
Leipzig. The company will be expanding production there and selling a wide
range of products for the German market and eastern Europe.
The German company was sold for an undisclosed sum.
Wyeth agreed to invest DM24m (Dollars 16m) by 1997 and to guarantee 200 out
of the present 235 jobs up to 1995.
