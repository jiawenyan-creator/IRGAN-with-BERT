FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Exploration and production side lifts Royal
Dutch/Shell
PROFITS AT Royal Dutch/Shell, the international oil group, were boosted by
an exceptionally good result from the company's exploration and production
division, but depressed by the first annual loss in a decade from its
chemicals business.
Sir Peter Holmes, chairman of Shell Transport, the group's UK arm, said that
although the oil price had dropped by Dollars 4.50 a barrel since 1990, the
company's exploration business had increased production and cut costs to
report an improvement in profit from Pounds 1.44bn to Pounds 1.86bn.
During 1992, Shell saw its oil production increase by 3 per cent to 2.2m
barrels a day (b/d) - the highest level since mid-1970s - with gas sales
also up by 3 per cent.
In the fourth quarter, the company increased its profits from exploration
and production from Pounds 391m to Pounds 682m in what analysts called an
'unusual' result, part of which is attributable to a lower tax bill.
Shell's refining and marketing operations showed a slight improvement on
1991 with profits rising to Pounds 1.24bn (Pounds 1.16bn) largely on the
back of stronger sales in the Far East market.
Sir Peter said that refining margins in Europe and the US were too low to
encourage the renewal of old plant.
In the fourth quarter, the company's refining and marketing division
reported a profit of Pounds 278m compared with Pounds 251m in the same
quarter of 1991.
Chemicals, which suffered from a continued downturn in the market for bulk
products and persistent over-capacity, reported a loss of Pounds 223m
compared with a profit of Pounds 23m.
In the final quarter of last year the loss reached Pounds 183m compared with
losses of Pounds 90m.
Earnings per share increased to 32.5p against 24.9p and Shell declared a
final dividend of 12.6p (12p) to lift the total for the year from 20.9p to
21.9p - a rise of 4.8 per cent.
Shell has maintained its strong financial position with net debt at Pounds
2.4bn and its debt to equity ratio at 7 per cent.
