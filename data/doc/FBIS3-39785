  [Text] Catherine Lalumiere, secretary general of the 
Council of Europe, has begun her contacts in Ankara. She first 
called on Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and conferred with him. 
  In a statement after the meeting, Lalumiere said that the 
developments in the Black Sea region and the Caucasus, the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, and the latest situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina were assessed with Cetin. Russia's role in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Caucasus were discussed within 
this context, Lalumiere added. She noted that the meeting was 
very beneficial. 
  Cetin, in turn, said that Turkey, one of the founding 
members 
of the Council of Europe, is determined to fully implement the 
principles of the Council. Pointing out that Turkey is under a 
serious terrorist threat, Cetin stressed the need for 
international cooperation against terrorism. 
  Lalumiere was then received by President Suleyman Demirel at 
the Cankaya Mansion.
