FT  23 DEC 93 / Award of Pounds 16m made against valuers
John D Wood Commercial, a commercial estate agent, has been ordered in the
High Court to pay Pounds 16m in damages after being found negligent in its
valuations on three properties.
The case, which was brought by Banque Bruxelles Lambert and Eagle Star, is
one of a growing number of negligence claims against surveying practices
that stem from allegedly excessive valuations carried out in the volatile
property market of the late 1980s.
The litigation concerned a number of BBL's property loans that were insured
by Eagle Star, on which the borrowers subsequently defaulted. The judge
criticised the valuers for paying insufficient attention to the marketing
history of the buildings in making their valuations.
The valuations attached to the buildings greatly exceeded the price at which
they had earlier changed hands. In one example a building in Westminster was
valued at Pounds 44.35m after being bought a month earlier for Pounds 25.5m.
Mr Justice Phillips said BBL had shown contributory negligence, and cut its
damages by 30 per cent.
The judge also ruled that valuers could not be liable for the fall in
property values that resulted from the collapse in the property market. This
ruling was greeted by lawyers as a significant departure from the
traditional view about how damages should be assessed when it is found that
a loan would not have been made without the overvaluation.
The settlement, by which John D Wood is required to pay Pounds 10.8m to
Banque Bruxelles Lambert and Pounds 5.3m to Eagle Star, may not be covered
by its insurers. The agent's indemnity insurance is understood to have been
withdrawn by Zurich Insurance, its principal insurer, before the hearing.
