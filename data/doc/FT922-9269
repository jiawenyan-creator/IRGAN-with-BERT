FT  08 MAY 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
London COCOA prices continued along the downward path, nearby July closing
above an earlier 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 561 a tonne. Dealers said any
rally in cocoa prices is likely to run into heavy origin sales. There were
indications of some selling by both the Ivory Coast and possibly Ghana
yesterday. Psychological support is seen emerging around Pounds 550 for
July. Robusta COFFEE prices failed to rise significantly despite gains in
New York linked to continued speculation about what steps key producers such
as Colombia and Brazil might take to stem the recent steep decline. New York
analysts said that technical indicators showed the arabica market to be very
oversold. Trade sources said the market remains awash in supply and origin
sales are seen keeping any upswing from running away. ZINC prices eased on
the LME, and the premium for cash metal over three-month narrowed in spite
of nervousness over technical tightness of supplies. The decline followed
Wednesday's fall below Dollars 1,280 a tonne for three-month metal. TIN
renewed its advance during late trading and closed at fresh 13-month highs,
while COPPER moved out of its recent dull range to end at four-week highs.
