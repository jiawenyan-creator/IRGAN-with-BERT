AIR, FIRE, WATER AND EARTH 
I may have to reevaluate my opinion of Governor Deukmejian based upon his 
support for a statewide trash separation and recycling law. What a great idea! 
Of course all Californians could voluntarily recycle glass, metal, paper and 
yard trimmings now. As consumers we are responsible for much of the problem, 
thus we must be part of the solution. But many citizens will never be motivated 
unless the state steps in.
