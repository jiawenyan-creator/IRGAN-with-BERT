ABUSED CHILDREN'S PROGRAM LOSES FUNDING CUT APPEAL 
Foothill Family Service, a 64-year-old Pasadena agency that operates a 
counseling program for sexually abused children, lost an appeal Tuesday in 
Sacramento for restoration of $123,000 in state-administered funds. 
Foothill, which serves nearly 1,000 abused children each year, had for the last 
three years received more than $100,000 annually in federal funds through the 
state Office of Criminal Justice Planning. 
The agency was not among 12 programs selected for another three years of 
funding. 
"The de-funding is occurring at a bad time," Foothill Executive Director David 
Eisenberg said. 
The loss represents about half of the agency's $250,000 annual budget for the 
sexual abuse counseling program, he said.
