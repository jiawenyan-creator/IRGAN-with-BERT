  [Text] Prague, May 30 (CTK) -- Armored vehicles are 
expected to be the main commodity in which the Chilean 
delegation headed by former dictator Augusto Pinochet will be 
interested during its forthcoming visit to the Czech Republic, 
CTK learnt today from well-informed diplomatic sources. 
  According to the latest information, Pinochet should arrive 
at Prague's Ruzyne Airport from Amsterdam after 3:00 P.M. today. 
The place in which he will stay in Prague remains unclear. The 
Chilean Embassy, which is one of the possibilities, refused to 
give any information to CTK. A bigger part of the Chilean 
mission will stay in the Inter-Continental Hotel, it seems. 
  According to unofficial information, Pinochet, now the 
supreme commander of the Chilean Army ground force, is expected 
to stay in Prague until June 4. In the course of his private 
visit he is scheduled to visit the IDET '94 international 
exhibition of military equipment in Brno, south Moravia, and 
visit several places outside Prague, the diplomatic source 
revealed.
