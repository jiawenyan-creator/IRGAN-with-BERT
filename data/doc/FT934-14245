FT  18 OCT 93 / Observer: Political priority
Peter Bottomley, the Conservative MP and former Northern Ireland minister,
sniffs winds of change in Ulster. To help them along he now writes columns
for the Irish News, a Belfast daily aimed mainly at the Catholic community
in Northern Ireland. Tom Collins, the paper's editor, hopes to heal
sectarian divisions by employing a diverse bunch of columnists.
Bottomley's columns preach reconciliation between religious, political and
ethnic enemies, in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. He accepts that chances
of his writing having much impact on political extremists are slim. 'But you
always live in hope,' he says.
More hope than tact perhaps. For in one column he writes: 'Why is the
turnover among party leaders in Northern Ireland so infrequent?' and
continues that if there 'is seldom a change of leader, political change may
be more difficult'.
That sort of thing may not go down well with his fellow Irish News columnist
and Ulster politician, Ian Paisley.
