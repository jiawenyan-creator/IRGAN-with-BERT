FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: MTM nets Pounds 4m from disposals
MTM, the fine chemicals company which suffered a share price collapse
earlier this year, has sold four businesses for Pounds 4.3m.
MTM, which reported a Pounds 20m interim loss in September, said it was
still talking to its bankers and advisers about a restructuring which could
entail a rescue rights issue.
It is negotiating the sale of two other businesses, which it hoped would
raise about Pounds 20m.
The businesses sold were Loba Feinchemie and Farcham Laboratories, Lancare
cleaning products and Collag Corp.
