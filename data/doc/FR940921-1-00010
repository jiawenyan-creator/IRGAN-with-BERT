of North Carolina


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The EPA proposes to approve the state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of North Carolina
for the purpose of redesignating Forsyth County area to attainment for carbon monoxide (CO). In the final rules section
of this 

Federal Register, 

the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the
approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final
rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the
direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based
on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested
in commenting on this document should do so at this time.

 
</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

To be considered, comments must be received by October 21, 1994.
