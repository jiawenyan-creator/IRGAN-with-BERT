FT  29 MAR 93 / International Company News: Adia passes dividend and plans
rights issue
ADIA, the troubled Swiss employment agency which plunged into loss last
year, has passed its dividend for the second year running and proposed a
recapitalisation involving a SFr250m (Dollars 166m) rights issue.
The net loss, at SFr219m, was slightly larger than estimated in January, and
compares with a profit of SFr25m in 1991. The group faced heavy
restructuring costs following excessive diversification in the late 1980s
when it was controlled by Mr Werner Rey, the disgraced financier.
Revenues were flat at SFr3.2bn. Core businesses accounted for SFr128m,
non-core businesses SFr5m, with the remainder coming from write-offs. Net
debt at year end was SFr922m compared with SFr1.48bn a year earlier.
The directors proposed cutting nominal share capital to SFr22.6m from
SFr225.6m and nominal participation certificate capital to SFr2m from
SFr20m. A rights issue would be launched, on the basis of 11 bearer shares
at SFr100 for each nine held and 11 class B participation certificates at
SFr100 for each 45 held.
The rights issues would be underwritten to the extent of SFr200m by Mr Klaus
Jacobs and Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus, which between them hold 56.2 per cent of
the votes and 43.2 per cent of the capital.
Asko said it would consider selling its stake in 1994 or later once the
group had returned to profitability. Adia said it could have a small loss in
1993.
