How we will determine whether your disability 
continues or ends.

(e)*** 

(1) 

A prior determination or decision was fraudulently 
obtained

. If we find that any prior favorable determination or 
decision was obtained by fraud, we may find that you are not 
disabled. In addition, we may reopen your claim under the rules 
in 404.988. In determining whether a prior favorable 
determination or decision was fraudulently obtained, we will take 
into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic 
limitations (including any lack of facility with the English 
language) which you may have had at the time. 


(2) 

You do not cooperate with us

. If there is a question 
about whether you continue to be disabled and we ask you to give 
us medical or other evidence or to go for a physical or mental 
examination by a certain date, we will find that your disability 
has ended if you fail, without good cause, to do what we ask. 
Section 404.911 explains the factors we consider and how we will 
determine generally whether you have good cause for failure to 
cooperate. In addition, 404.1518 discusses how we determine 
whether you have good cause for failing to attend a consultative 
examination. The month in which your disability ends will be the 
first month in which you failed to do what we asked.
