  [Excerpt] The office of the Chamber of Deputies is due to 
announce its official position tonight regarding the resolution 
passed by the Senate office headed by Senator Sansaricq 
regarding the application of Article 149 of the Constitution. 
The president of the Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to address 
the nation on the evening of Wednesday [13 April] on the crisis. 
On 12 April, the office led by Sen. Sansaricq submitted the text 
of the 10 April resolution to the office of the lower chamber. 
  Questioned on this document, the president of the deputies 
expressed serious reservations regarding the future of this 
resolution. Deputy Monde thinks that it is necessary to fill the 
institutional vacuum. However, Monde explains that it cannot be 
done in just any manner. Deputy Monde calls the conference on 10 
April, which led to the resolution on Article 149, a pirate 
action. The president of the lower chamber indicates that 
hidden, major, economic interests are behind this resolution. 
[passage omitted] 
  Moreover, the president of the Chamber of Deputies 
maintained 
that his colleagues would not give in to the senators' pressures.
