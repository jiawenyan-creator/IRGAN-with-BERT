FT  25 MAY 93 / Observer: Faulty plug
Another public relations triumph from Hoover, home of the
never-to-be-repeated free flights offer. Yesterday, Gerald Kamman, the
company's European president, gave a press conference in Paris to say that
it was, after all, going to close its Dijon plant and transfer output to
Scotland - a move which caused an Anglo-French political fracas when first
mooted earlier this year. Unfortunately, no British newspapers were there to
cover the event because Hoover failed to invite any. . . .
