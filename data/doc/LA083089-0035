ASK COUNTING QUESTION, GET MANY ANSWERS 
Just what is the population of Santa Clarita? 
Depending on who you ask, the city has about 113,000 residents. Or 127,000. Or 
147,000. 
State, county and Santa Clarita officials admit that the real answer may be 
none of the above. 
Until the 1990 census is complete, government agencies can only estimate the 
population of the city that will celebrate its second anniversary in December, 
officials say. The figures vary because each agency uses a different method to 
estimate population growth. 
Donald M. Williams, an associate planner in Santa Clarita, said he believes 
that the most accurate figure is from a marketing firm that recently estimated 
the population at 127,000. 
On Monday, the Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning released a 
report that called Santa Clarita the fastest growing city in the county during 
the first six months of 1988. In that time, the population grew to 113,048, the 
report said. 
George Malone, head of the department's population research section, said the 
figure is based on the number of building permits and the size of the average 
household. 
The county figure is close to an estimate by the state Department of Finance, 
which said the city had 115,700 residents as of Jan. 1. 
But the official state estimate -- the one that appears on city boundary signs 
-- is 147,000. That figure, from the state controller, is based on a formula 
used to determine the populations of newly incorporated cities. The controller 
multiplies the number of registered voters by three to get an estimate. 
City, county and state officials do, however, agree that the controller's 
figure is simply wrong. "That's a little high," said John Malson, a researcher 
with the Department of Finance. "That 147,000 number shouldn't be bandied 
around. It shouldn't be quoted." 
But until the census, 147,000 is the official state figure, city and state 
officials said.
