FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Barclays' NZ side up 80%
BARCLAYS' New Zealand subsidiary announced an 80 per cent rise in profits
from NZDollars 6.1m to a record NZDollars 11m (Pounds 3.85m) last year.
Mr Warren Salisbury, general manager, said the result reflected increased
revenues, a drop in overheads, and improved processing systems.
The division cut its staff by 20 to 40 people.
Mr Salisbury said most of the revenue came from the asset book, which he
said was valued at between NZDollars 1bn and NZDollars 1.5bn.
Barclays bought the swaps book of DFC New Zealand, the collapsed former
state-owned investment bank, in 1991.
The New Zealand branch trades in the short term money market, and is active
in the foreign exchange forwards and swaps markets, but does not deal in the
spot New Zealand dollar.
