  [Text] The Liberal Party-1993 [PL-93] seconds the 
initiative of its partners within the Democratic Convention of 
Romania [CDR] to initiate procedures to suspend President Ion 
Iliescu, says a political statement signed by the PL-93 Steering 
Committee, which was presented during today's news conference by 
Professor Balaceanu-Stolnici, chairman of the PL-93 Senate. 
  After emphasizing that the president and the government are 
conducting an antinational policy, the statement points out that 
PL-93 considers it mandatory that the procedures to suspend the 
president should be accompanied by a censure motion to withdraw 
the confidence granted to the Vacaroiu government. 
  Talking about other issues, PL-93 Senator Alexandru Popovici 
referred to the issue of nationalized dwellings, assessing that 
the way in which that subject has been approached could make one 
conclude that what they want is a definite nationalization. 
  During the news conference they also announced that PL-93 
will request that the agenda of the next meeting of the CDR 
Standing Bureau should also include the issue of withdrawing the 
political support granted to Crin Halaicu, general mayor of 
Bucharest, who is guilty of having violated the law, as Ludovic 
Orban [member of the PL-93 Steering Committee] put it.
