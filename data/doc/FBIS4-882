  [Text] Monrovia, 18 Apr (AFP) -- Soldiers of one of 
Liberia's armed factions have detained five local employees of a 
French aid organisation, the UN bureau announced here Monday [18 
April]. The five, employed by International Action Against 
Hunger, were being held in the port city of Harper, 400 
kilometers (240 miles) southeast of here, by the National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL]. They were detained last week 
on suspicion of supporting the Liberia Peace Council, a rival 
militia set up in September, a UN spokesman said. 
  Fighting broke out last week between Charles Taylor's NPFL 
and the Liberia Peace Council in Rivercess, 160 kilometers (90 
miles) southeast of here, prompting people to flee to Buchanan 
where some 80,000 people are now being taken care of by 
humanitarian organisations, the spokesman said. Because of 
increased insecurity in southeastern Liberia, the American 
Catholic Relief Services have announced they were suspending 
operations in the region.
