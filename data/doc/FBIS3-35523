<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ahmad al-Tibi, political adviser </F>
to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, by Hayim Zissowitz -- live] 
  [Text] [Zissowitz] You heard about the Hebron incident and 
discussed it with Yasir 'Arafat. 
  [Al-Tibi] Yes, he talked with me this morning. 
  [Zissowitz] He called you for details? 
  [Al-Tibi] In fact, he had more details than I. From what I 
know at this stage, between 20 and 25 people were killed. The 
16 Dr. Tamimi talked about were those admitted to his hospital. 
Others were taken to different hospitals, and dozens were 
wounded, many more than Dr. Tamimi mentioned. A massacre 
occurred in the Cave of the Patriarchs. 
  [Zissowitz] From what you know, was one man responsible for 
the whole incident? 
  [Al-Tibi] According to what some of the worshipers say, it 
is still not certain if only one settler was responsible. From 
what is known, a settler entered the Cave of the Patriarchs and 
indiscriminately massacred people. He was apparently hit by a 
fire extinguisher, which was hurled at him in order to stop the 
shooting. There was also firing at different sites in Hebron 
near the Cave of the Patriarchs. 
  [Zissowitz] Are you saying that the same person went on a 
rampage, firing as he went along, or that when he fired in the 
cave others were shooting outside? 
  [Al-Tibi] I do not have definite information at this stage, 
and I want to be precise. I am not certain that one person was 
responsible for all the fatalities. At this stage, there are at 
least 20 to 25 fatalities and the number of casualties has 
reached more than 80. 
  [Zissowitz] Do you know to which hospitals they were taken? 
  [Al-Tibi] Yes, they were taken to Hebron hospital, 
al-Maqasid, and other hospitals. We view the rampage by Jewish 
settlers with great gravity. We think a stop should be put to 
them immediately and the law imposed on them once and for all. 
A curfew must be imposed on Qiryat Arba' and not the area where 
the massacre occurred, which is Hebron. Once and for all the 
Jewish population must be told that they cannot continuing going 
on rampages and massacring innocent people. Violence by either 
side -- but now I am speaking with pain about massacred 
Palestinians -- can definitely endanger the atmosphere of 
conciliation we are working so hard to bring about for both 
peoples. The Israeli Government and Army have to use all legal 
measures to bring order among the settlers who shoot freely in 
order to massacre peaceful Palestinians during their Ramadan 
morning prayers. 
  [Zissowitz] Did 'Arafat call on you to make those remarks or 
to pass on some message to the prime minister? 
  [Al-Tibi] I do not want to say what contacts I had this 
morning. I have said what I can at this stage.
