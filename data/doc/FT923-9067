FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Kirin turns in 13% fall at
halfway
KIRIN BREWERY, Japan's biggest beer producer, yesterday reported a 13.1 per
cent fall in interim pre-tax profits to Y32.1bn (Dollars 252m). It blamed
increased depreciation costs after expanding capacity in recent years, and
lower interest income.
The earnings fall for the six months to June came in spite of a 5.2 per cent
rise in sales to Y609.8bn. Beer sales volumes, for domestic consumption and
export, rose 4.1 per cent, showing higher growth than the industry average.
Kirin, which accounts for about half the Japanese beer market, has been
battling to maintain its share in the face of slowing growth in demand.
Marketing costs among the three main brewers have been rising as a result.
The company is also cutting shipping costs by licensing production overseas.
It linked up last month with Bedford-based Charles Wells to brew Kirin lager
for the UK market and export to the rest of Europe.
Along with Asahi and Sapporo, its rivals, Kirin expects 1992 pre-tax profits
to fall. It forecast a 5.1 per cent decline for the full year to Y82bn, on
sales up 4.9 per cent to Y1,380bn.
Net income is, however, expected to edge higher at Y35.15 a share, compared
with Y34.90. The company is holding to a planned rise in its total payout to
Y10 a share, from Y9.
Although the company has surplus cash, with Y138bn on deposit, its financial
position will be dented by the expiry this month of more than Y50bn in
warrant bonds with an exercise price offering a Kirin share at Y2,324. The
shares closed in Tokyo yesterday at Y1,140, and the issue is thus likely to
expire unexercised.
Suntory, Japan's largest whisky distiller and one of the country's biggest
private companies, managed a 6.6 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y5.3bn
for the half-year.
