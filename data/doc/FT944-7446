FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bankwest advances ahead of
sell-off
The Bank of Western Australia, which is due to be privatised by the state
government but already has an unwanted buyer in the form of the smaller
Challenge Bank, yesterday announced a profit after tax and abnormals of
ADollars 82.7m (USDollars 63.12m) for the year to the end of September,
against ADollars 37.3m the previous year, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
Professor Ross Garnaut, Bankwest chairman, said the bank was ready for a
full flotation, and that this would be a less risky option than a merger
with Challenge.
