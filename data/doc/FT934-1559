FT  18 DEC 93 / Kohl's health plan rejected by Bundesrat
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's efforts to push through reforms aimed at financing
care for the aged failed yesterday, when the reforms were rejected by the
Bundesrat or upper house.
The reforms, aimed at shifting the burden of old age health care away from
local councils on to enterprises, were defeated by the opposition Social
Democrats, who form the majority in the Bundesrat. Another joint commission
 -the third so far - is expected to be set up in January to work out a new
proposal.
Mr Friedrich Bohl, head of the Chancellery, said the government was 'very
disappointed' with the result, and accused the SPD of blocking necessary
help for the 2m people dependent on nursing. Full time nursing, which costs
about DM5,000 (Pounds 1,950) a month, is financed by the municipalities,
many of which are running large budget deficits.
Mr Kohl, and Mr Norbert Blum, the labour minister, had pledged to introduce
reforms before next year's state and federal elections to win the votes of
the elderly.
The reform measures came unstuck after SPD officials representing the
Lander, or states, challenged the way in which employees would have to
finance the reforms.
The government had intended to seek contributions of 1 per cent a month
starting from 1994, and 1.7 per cent after 1996, which would be shared
equally by employees and employers.
But employers were sharply critical of the measures, saying they would
further reduce Germany's competitiveness by raising wage bills for industry.
At the insistence of the Free Democrats, the junior partners in the
coalition, a plan was tabled for compensating employers through a cut in
official holiday pay by 10 per cent from next year, and 20 per cent in 1996,
or through the scrapping of first one day of holiday, and then two, by 1996.
However, SPD deputies - and the trade unions - rejected both the
compensation arrangements, and the level of employee contributions.
