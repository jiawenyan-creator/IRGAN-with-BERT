 

IV. Investment Company Act Disclosure



The Commission is proposing to add legal proceedings disclosure, as proposed to be amended, to investment company
registration statement forms and to expand the scope of legal proceedings disclosure in proxy statements. Currently,
legal proceedings disclosure is specifically required only in investment company proxy statements related to the
election of directors.

118

 Investment Company Act disclosure documents are intended, among other things, to inform investors and investment
company shareholders about matters that concern the background and qualifications of those persons who oversee
(such as directors) or manage (such as investment advisers) an investment company and its assets. The Commission
believes that disclosure of information concerning legal proceedings may be material to investors and shareholders
and is, therefore, proposing to require this disclosure in investment company disclosure documents.

Item 22(b)(4) of Schedule 14A. Prior to the recent amendments to the proxy rules applicable to investment companies,
which consolidated the disclosure requirements in Item 22 of Schedule 14A (Release No. IC20614 (October 13,
1994) [59 FR 52689]), Rule 20a1 under the Investment Company Act required legal proceedings disclosure by
reference to Item 7 of Schedule 14A. 

</FOOTNOTE>


The proposed amendments would require Item 401(f) disclosure in investment company prospectuses.

119

 Because most investment companies are externally managed by investment advisers, the Commission also is proposing
to require disclosure concerning not only directors and officers of the investment company, but also ``managerial
persons'' of the investment adviser.

120

 For the purposes of the legal proceedings disclosure, ``managerial persons'' would mean ``affiliated persons''
of the investment adviser as that term is defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act

121

 who are engaged in the management, direction, supervision, or performance of any activities related to the investment
company.

122

 This definition would include, for example, officers or employees of the investment adviser whose duties are related
to the management of an investment company.

123

 On the other hand, the definition is not intended to require disclosure with respect to persons affiliated with the
investment adviser who have no managerial or similar responsibilities with respect to the investment company.

124

 The Commission requests comment on whether the proposed definition of ``managerial persons'' will result in appropriate
disclosure that will provide material information to investment company investors and shareholders.

Proposed amendments to: Item 5 of Form N1A (open-end investment companies); Item 9 of Form N2 (closed-end
investment companies) Item 6 of Form N3 (separate accounts that offer variable annuity contracts that are
registered under the Investment Company Act); Form N4 (separate accounts that offer variable annuity contracts
which are registered under the Investment Company Act as unit investment trusts); Items 11, 12, and 16 of Form N5
(small business investment companies); Item 28 of Form N8B2 (unit investment trusts); Items 26, 27,
and 28 of Form N8B3 (investment companies issuing periodic payment plan certificates); Items 29 and
34 of Form N8B4 (face amount certificate companies). 

The Commission also is proposing amendments to Schedules A and B of Regulation E [17 CFR 230.610a] under the Securities
Act which would require offering circulars used by small business investment companies and business development
companies relying on the Regulation E exemption to include the information specified in proposed Item 401(f) as to
each director, executive officer and advisory board member of the issuer and as to managerial persons of the investment
adviser of the issuer.

In the case of an investment company registered as a separate account on Forms N3, N4 or N8B2,
disclosure would be required of legal proceedings involving the directors, officers and employees of the sponsoring
insurance company, or its affiliates, who participate directly in the management or administration of the separate
account.

15 U.S.C. 80a2(a)(3). An affiliated person is: (i) a person who directly or indirectly owns or controls more
than 5% of the voting securities of a person; (ii) a person of which more than 5% of the voting securities is owned or controlled
by a person; (iii) a person that is controlled, controlled by, or under common control with, a person; (iv) any officer,
director, partner, or employees of a person; (v) if such person is an investment company, the investment adviser or
any member of the advisory board thereof; and (vi) if the person is an unincorporated investment company without a
board of directors, the depositor thereof.

The term ``managerial persons'' is similar to, but not the same as, the term ``management person'' used in Rule 206(4)4
under the Investment Advisers Act [17 CFR 275.206(4)4]. Rule 206(4)4 requires investment advisers
to disclose to their clients certain financial and disciplinary information about the investment adviser or a management
person of the adviser. For purposes of Rule 206(4)4, a management person is defined as a person who controls
the adviser or determines the general investment advice given to clients.

</FOOTNAME>
This disclosure would include a fund's portfolio manager as well as any member of a portfolio management committee.

</FOOTNAME>
For a large company with investment advisory services and other types of businesses, monitoring and reporting legal
proceedings about all persons affiliated with the company could be costly and result in lengthy disclosure. 


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


125

</FOOTNAME>
The proposed legal proceeding disclosure would require information concerning persons, otherwise barred under
section 9(a) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a9(a)], who have been permitted by the Commission under
section 9(c) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a9(c)] to be associated with an investment company.


</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission also is proposing to conform the legal proceedings disclosure in proxy statements to the registration
statement forms, as proposed to be amended. The proposed disclosure in proxy statements for officers and directors
of the investment company and managerial persons of the investment adviser would be required 

both 

in connection with the election of directors, as currently required, and in proxy statements seeking approval of
an investment advisory contract.

126

 Legal proceedings disclosure may be as relevant to a shareholder's assessment of an investment advisory contract
as it is to the election of directors.
