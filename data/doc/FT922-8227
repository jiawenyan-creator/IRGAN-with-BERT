FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Heavy UK losses peg Allied Irish Banks'
rise
HEAVY LOSSES in the commercial mortgage lending business in the UK
restricted pre-tax profits growth at Allied Irish Banks, Ireland's leading
financial services group, in the year ended March 31 1992.
Profits came to IPounds 185.8m (Pounds 168.5m). That represented an increase
of 4 per cent on the previous IPounds 178.8m, after allowing for a 2 per
cent rise in bad debts provision to IPounds 178.3m (IPounds 174m).
In Ireland and US the divisions both performed well showing strong profits
growth - the former was up 9 per cent while the US was 1 1/2 times greater.
The UK division, however, increased its losses from IPounds 4.9m to IPounds
47m which, according to Mr Gerald Scanlan, group chief executive, 'was due
to a very high bad debt charge resulting from a recession which has been the
deepest and most prolonged since the war'.
He said 30 per cent of the IPounds 750m UK loan portfolio to the small
business sector was presently non-performing; that was a 65 per cent
increase on the previous year. The bank specialises in giving commercial
property loans to restaurants, pubs and hotels.
'We expect the situation in Britain to remain difficult through the coming
year,' said Mr Scanlan.
The bank currently had 200 specialist financial staff working with its
customers facing difficulties in the UK 'to keep them up and running. Our
experience has been that it is very difficult to sell a business once the
door is shut'. The non-performing loans were being handled by the specialist
workout unit, while the profitable business had been placed with its 35
branches in the UK which 'continued to show a profit last year'.
Mr Scanlan said there had been an overhaul of operations in the UK, with
lay-offs of 300 out of the 1,400 staff 'from all levels from the chief
executive down' and which he said would result in the division moving to a
'more focused operation'. He anticipated pre-tax profits of IPounds 35m from
the UK division 'within two years'.
Group total assets increased by 2.2 per cent to IPounds 18.2bn (IPounds
17.9bn), and it's Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio, as defined by the Bank of
International Settlements, hads remained at 6.6 per cent - that, Mr Scanlan
pointed out, was currently better than most of the UK clearing banks.
Earnings per share were 16.1p (15.2p), and the dividend is lifted to 8.25p
(7.75p) through a final of 4.65p.
