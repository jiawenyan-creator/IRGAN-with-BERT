FT  21 JUL 93 / Observer: Saab trolls for elks
Fingers crossed today that Keith Butler-Wheelhouse will turn up on time for
the all-important launch of the new Saab 900 model. The genial Brit, who was
brought in by part-owners General Motors last year to drive the beleaguered
Swedish car maker out of the woods, admits to having got lost there himself
last week. Turning up at work an uncharacteristic 45 minutes late, he
explained that he and his dog on their morning run had strayed by 6kms
through the forest near the company's home town of Trollhattan.
The presence of Butler-Wheelhouse - who led the management buy-out of GM's
South African operation eight years ago - and of the American John Fleming
in the marketing role testifies to the concern at GM, 50 per cent owner with
the Wallenberg family since 1989, that Saab should finally turn the corner
after four years of deep losses.
To this end and with its home market very much in mind, the new 900 was
tested on its ability to withstand collisions with elks - a not infrequent
occurrence on Swedish roads. Saab engineers insist that there is no safer
car on the road when it comes to a head-on encounter with a large deer. But
what about Saab's other cherished reputation - for producing the world's
greenest, as well as safest car? Don't worry, the engineers say. We used a
dummy elk.
