THE STATE 
Christmas decorations still glow nightly in downtown Delano. It's not that 
residents remain captivated by the holiday; it's just that the Chamber of 
Commerce does not have the money to store the decorations and pay for insurance 
coverage. Because of the lack of funds, the chamber's board voted against 
renewing a contract to have a Fresno-area firm store the green and red 
decorations. They have been plugged into city light poles since mid-November, 
and the lights turn on automatically every evening.
