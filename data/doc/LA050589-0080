COMMUTERS' CARS POSE CANCER PERIL, NEW STUDY WARNS 
Commuters who travel the Los Angeles Basin's congested roadways are exposed in 
their cars to between two and four times the levels of cancer-causing toxic 
chemicals found outdoors, according to a new study to be released today. 
Added to this disturbing finding, the two-year study by researchers for the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District concluded that it makes little 
difference whether drivers roll their windows up in an effort to block fumes; 
commuters are only slightly better off with windows closed. And, perhaps 
surprising to some, the study found that motorists are better off with car 
vents open rather than closed. 
Not surprisingly, however, the study also concluded that motorists caught in 
traffic of less than 25 m.p.h. have greater exposure to toxic gases than when 
traffic is moving at more than 30 m.p.h., and that older vehicles -- those made 
from 1973 to 1983 -- allow "significantly higher" levels of carbon monoxide, 
benzene and toluene to seep in. 
"Even assuming a constant level of inspection and maintenance, older vehicles' 
emission controls and other parts continue to deteriorate, causing more 
emissions of exhaust pollutants" into the car and the atmosphere, the study 
said. 
Researchers cautioned that higher exposures do not necessarily translate into 
equally heightened health risks. But there is general agreement that as 
exposures increase, so do health risks. 
The study, funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is expected to 
add new urgency to the AQMD's drive to tighten vehicle emission standards and 
step up ride-sharing efforts. The study, a copy of which was obtained by The 
Times, is to be released at an AQMD board meeting in El Monte. 
The report called for stepped-up ride-sharing, traffic signal synchronization 
and staggered work hours -- all proposed in the AQMD's sweeping clean air 
blueprint approved by the district in March. 
Measures Suggested 
"These measures, in combination with more stringent vehicle emission limits, 
can reduce exposures to air pollutants in vehicles as well as in other 
environments," the study said. 
Scientists have long recognized that outdoor exposures account for only a 
portion of an individual's total exposure to various pollutants. Over the last 
several years, researchers have found that concentrations of some toxic, 
cancer-causing and mutagenic pollutants found indoors, while still relatively 
low, are nonetheless often at least 10 times greater than outdoors and far 
exceed limits placed on the same pollutants in outdoor air by the federal Clean 
Air Act. 
While there have been previous studies dealing with carbon monoxide exposures 
in cars and hundreds of studies dealing with toxic pollutants in buildings, the 
AQMD research is believed to be one of the first "substantive" examinations of 
a wide range of air toxics found in cars, according to an AQMD source who asked 
to remain anonymous. 
Benzene, a known human carcinogen associated with leukemia, poses the greatest 
health risk to the Basin's commuters of all the 16 toxics studied, researchers 
said. They found benzene concentrations in cars were about four times higher 
than those outdoors. 
It is estimated that, among the Basin's total population, there is a one in 
10,000 chance of getting cancer from benzene exposure. Based on the study, 
researchers concluded that 15% of those cases -- or 15 out of a million -- 
would be due to exposure during commuting to and from work. 
Higher Risk 
But the total cancer risk from benzene exposures while driving is probably much 
higher than that, researchers said. They cautioned that their study looked only 
at exposures during round-trip commutes to work, which averaged 1 1/2 hours 
each weekday. The study did not survey trips to the store or other errands. 
"This risk from total in-vehicle exposure would be greater if all non-work 
commute trips were considered," the study warned. 
The study noted that others have estimated that each weekday there are 3.35 
million round trips from home to office, 13.5 million non-work round trips, and 
3.15 million one-way work related trips. 
Lead concentrations measured in vehicles were roughly 60% higher than outdoor 
levels. 
A total of 140 commuter cars were sampled for in-vehicle concentrations of 16 
air pollutants while commuting to and from work. The participants, who were 
randomly selected, lived throughout the four-county South Coast Air Basin, but 
all commute to Flair Business Park in South El Monte. 
Monitoring Devices 
Special monitoring devices were installed in the cars and drivers kept a log of 
their mileage. 
Researchers called for support of the state Air Resource Board's proposal to 
limit benzene content of gasoline beginning in 1993. 
The new limits would cut the cancer risks estimated in the study by 20%, 
researchers said. 
"Benzene contributes the great risk to the Basin's commuters," the study said. 
The study was conducted by Ditas C. Shikiya, Chung S. Liu, Michael I. Kahn, 
Jesse Juarros and Wayne Barcikowski of the AQMD's Office of Planning and Rules. 
The 16 pollutants studied were: carbon monoxide; benzene; toluene; xylene; 
ethylene dibromide; ethylene dichloride; lead; formaldehyde; acetaldehyde; 
carbon tetrachloride; chloroform; perchloroethylene; 1,1,1-Trichloroethylene; 
cadmium; chromium and nickel. 
COMMUTERS AND TOXIC POLLUTANTS 
A new study by the South Coast Air Quality Management District shows that 
people driving in cars are exposed to higher concentrations of most toxic air 
contaminants than are found in generally in the Los Angeles Basin. Researchers 
placed special monitors inside vehicles and asked drivers to keep a log of 
their commuting habits. Gas levels are in parts per billion; metals levels are 
in micro-grams per cubic meter
