FT  27 MAY 92 / Call to strengthen Commons groups
THE cross-party Commons committees that shadow government departments should
be given greater powers to call the prime minister to account, Mr Michael
Meacher, a member of Labour's shadow cabinet, said yesterday.
In a speech at a Labour rally as part of the party's leadership contest, Mr
Meacher said that the committees should have a new role in relation to the
prime minister.
The prime minister should be answerable to the relevant committee if he
intervened on a departmental matter, and the committees should be able to
ratify or stop important public appointments in their areas, he said.
Mr Meacher also called for the committees to be given stonger powers to
summon ministers to give evidence.
The departmental committees themselves have not yet been appointed since the
election. Although the government's business managers are trying to get them
established, there are some fears at Westminster that they might not be able
to start work until the autumn.
