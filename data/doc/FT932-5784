FT  02 JUN 93 / Observer: Bragging
Who better than Melvyn Bragg, pal of ex-Labour leader Neil Kinnock and
presenter of ITV's South Bank Show, to host yesterday's How to Become a
Millionaire book promotion organised by Faber &amp; Faber, the upmarket
publishing house.
Given that Bragg stands to make Pounds 2.2m on his Pounds 32,000 investment
in London Weekend Television, he ought to know a thing or two about playing
games where lots of money is involved.
What did he think of the odds of a Faber contestant picking the one book in
a hundred containing the Pounds 1m check at yesterday's event? Bragg's view
is that the odds on the Faber winner, Nikki Llewelyn, making loads of money,
were better than his own LWT gamble. Even if she failed to win the Pounds 1m
(which she did), she was still guaranteed a Pounds 10,000 prize. 'We would
have lost everything if PolyGram (a rival franchise bidder) had got its act
together,' says an unrepentant Bragg, who admits that he inherited the
gambling spirit from his Dad who rarely goes a day without placing a bet.
