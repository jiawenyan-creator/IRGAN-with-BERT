  [Text] The HVO [Croatian Defense Council] also reports that 
Serbs and Muslims are fighting around Novi Travnik. Since early 
this morning artillery explosions were heard on parts of the 
Novi Travnik and Travnik fronts in what is most likely a battle 
between Serbian and Muslim armies. However, the Muslim army did 
aim small arms fire onto parts of the Travnik front that are 
under HVO control. Muslim snipers are also active in Mostar as 
well. There are no reports of casualties.
