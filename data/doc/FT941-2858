FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lower debt provisions help Birmingham
Midshires
Birmingham Midshires Building Society announced a two-thirds rise in 1993
pre-tax profits to Pounds 39.7m, compared with Pounds 23.9m, helped by a
fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
The society, the UK's 13th largest, cut its provisions from Pounds 37m to
Pounds 22.3m. Mr Mike Jackson, chief executive, said that the society had
acted earlier than some others in making provision and in taking aggressive
action to deal with arrears. He expected provisions to fall at a similar
pace in 1994.
Assets rose over the 12 months by 13 per cent to more than Pounds 4bn for
the first time with Pounds 4.3bn, against Pounds 3.8bn, after a series of
mortgage book acquisitions during the year.
The society's cost to income ratio remained above the sector average, though
it fell from 53 per cent to 49.4 per cent last year. Mr Jackson said he
expected the ratio to continue to fall, though at a slower rate because of
the investments the society was undertaking.
Birmingham Midshires is spending some Pounds 20m in a new building, and is
also investing in changing its core computer systems.
Mr Jackson said that the society was 'in growth mode' and set as its
priority the development of new products for its customers such as current
accounts and offshore operations.
The society has stepped back from some of the activities into which it
diversified a few years ago. It has sold its commercial insurance broker,
stopped offering to process mortgages for third parties, and has a reduced
estate agency business of some 22 branches compared with the 71 it had in
1990.
Birmingham Midshires attracted net retail funds of Pounds 251m in 1993, in
which its postal accounts were an important element. Wholesale funding was
21.7 per cent of total shares and deposits.
