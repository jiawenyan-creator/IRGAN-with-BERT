Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; 
District of Columbia; Oxygenated Gasoline Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing a limited approval/limited disapproval of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted
by the District of Columbia. This revision implements an oxygenated gasoline program in the District of Columbia.
The intended effect of this action is to propose approval of those subsections of the District of Columbia Municipal
Regulations (DCMR) which pertain to oxygenated gasoline for the limited purpose of strengthening the District of
Columbia SIP which currently has no requirements for an oxygenated gasoline program. In addition, this action is
intended to propose disapproval of those subsections of the DCMR which pertain to oxygenated gasoline for the limited
purpose of allowing the District of Columbia the opportunity to correct the deficiencies in the regulation which
result in its failure to meet all requirements of the Clean Air Act. This action is being taken under Section 110 of the
Clean Air Act.

I. Introduction 



Motor vehicles are significant contributors of carbon monoxide emissions. An important measure toward reducing
these emissions is the use of cleaner-burning oxygenated gasoline. Extra oxygen enhances fuel combustion and helps
to offset fuel-rich operating conditions, particularly during vehicle starting, which are more prevalent in the
winter. 

Section 211(m) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7401 

et seq.

 (the Act), requires that various states submit revisions to their SIPs, and implement oxygenated gasoline programs
by no later than November 1, 1992. This requirement applies to all states with carbon monoxide nonattainment areas
with design values of 9.5 parts per million or more based generally on 1988 and 1989 data. Each state's oxygenated gasoline
program must require gasoline for the specified control area(s) to contain not less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight
during that portion of the year in which the areas are prone to high ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide. Under
section 211(m)(2), the oxygenated gasoline requirements are to generally cover all gasoline sold or dispensed in
the larger of the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) or the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)
in which the nonattainment area is located. Under section 211(m)(2), the length of the control period, to be established
by the EPA Administrator, shall not be less than four months in length unless a state can demonstrate that, because
of meteorological conditions, a reduced control period will assure that there will be no carbon monoxide exceedances
outside of such reduced period. EPA announced guidance on the establishment of control periods by area in the 

Federal Register

 on October 20, 1992.
