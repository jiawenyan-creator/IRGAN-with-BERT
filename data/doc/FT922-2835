FT  15 JUN 92 / International Company News: Bank of Finland to sell Skopbank
stake
THE BANK of Finland has agreed to sell its shareholding in Skopbank, the
country's third largest commercial bank, which it saved from collapse last
autumn, to the Finnish government's newly formed Guarantee Fund.
The FM1.5bn (Dollars 349m) deal is expected to be signed in Helsinki today.
It is to be financed through a short-term credit line which the Bank of
Finland will extend to the Government Guarantee Fund for as long as
requir-ed.
After the transfer the fund will hold 52.9 per cent of Skopbank's equity and
63.59 per cent of its voting rights.
The Fund said the transfer of the shareholding would not affect Skopbank's
operations as a banking institution for the Finnish savings banks or as a
commercial bank and it would be responsible for its solvency.
Negotiations will continue over the sale of Skopbank and the restructuring
of the savings bank group so that it can once more be on a stable and secure
footing.
Last September the Central Bank was forced to take direct control of
Skopbank to save it from financial collapse.
As a result of its rescue operation the Bank of Finland estimates that it
has already lost FM4.9bn. The deal with the government will result in a
further loss of FM2bn.
On top of this the Bank of Finland's holding companies still hold assets
worth FM9.6bn from Skopbank. These are to be sold off within the next few
years when market conditions allow.
