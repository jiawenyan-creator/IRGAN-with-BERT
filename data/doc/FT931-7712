FT  23 FEB 93 / Observer: Halifax's top gun
If the Halifax were going to recruit a new chief executive from within the
ranks of the building society movement, then Mike Blackburn seems as good a
choice as any.
He has knocked the Leeds Permanent Building society into shape during his
five years at the helm and he has proved far more rebellious than the
average building society boss when it comes to questioning government
policies.
However, the Halifax is a good three times bigger than the Leeds Permanent
and it will be interesting to see whether its board allows Blackburn such
freedom of expression, especially if it is wanting government help to smooth
its passage to the stock market at some stage.
