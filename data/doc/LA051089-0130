Fierce thunderstorms whipped the Mississippi Delta, battering the area with 
high winds. Thunderstorms and hailstorms also socked the Carolinas, Georgia, 
the Ohio Valley and Oklahoma, the weather service said. Mississippi's storms 
spread to Louisiana by late morning, pelting the towns of Mira and Benton with 
golfball-sized hail. The weather service clocked winds at Mira at 62 m.p.h. At 
the state prison in Parchman, Miss., a corrections officer suffered a broken 
leg when the watchtower she was in collapsed in high winds, officials said. A 
second guard suffered a minor injury. About 80 staff homes and three mobile 
homes were damaged.
