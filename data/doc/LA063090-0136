FOOTHILL GROUP BACKS N. TUSTIN CITY PROPOSAL 
The Foothill Communities Assn. board voted this week to support cityhood for 
the region, possibly as early as next year, said Bill Weber, the group's 
president. 
The association will encourage the formation of a group to bring the issue to a 
vote in 1991, Weber said. 
A survey taken at a town hall meeting showed general support for North Tustin 
becoming a city, he said. 
Meanwhile, in response to county supervisors' decision to disband the North 
Tustin Municipal Advisory Council, the Communities Assn. is expanding the scope 
and size of its land-use panel -- at least until the county replaces the 
council with another body. 
Five of the seven former members of the council are members of the land-use 
panel. The committee will meet on the second Monday of each month at 7:30 p.m. 
at Pomona First Federal Savings and Loan Assn., 17851 17th St.
