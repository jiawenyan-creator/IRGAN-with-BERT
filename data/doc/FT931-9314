FT  15 FEB 93 / People: YWCA's leadership
Gill Tishler has joined the Young Women's Christian Association of Great
Britain as its new chief executive on the departure of Elizabeth Sharples,
who is retiring after 14 years in the position.
The boss of the YWCA has always been a woman 'because the worldwide
organisation believes very strongly in leadership by women', according to
Tishler who, at 34, is younger than any of her predecessors.
Tishler joined the Ministry of Agriculture from Oxford in 1979; she spent
part of her time in Brussels, and worked in the private office of two junior
ministers before making 'a very deliberate move into the voluntary sector'
in 1987.
She started with the Royal National Institute for the Blind doing
parliamentary work and campaigning before becoming head of public affairs.
Now she thinks her marketing and public relations skills will be very
relevant in her new job, which will also allow her to make 'practical use'
of her faith, she says.
The charity which, as well as being a registered housing association is
engaged in youth and community work 'empowering young women aged between 13
and 26', is involved with between 60,000-75,000 people countrywide and has a
budget of Pounds 8m.
