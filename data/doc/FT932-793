FT  26 JUN 93 / International Company News: Email to pay ADollars 326.5m for
NCL businesses
EMAIL, the Australian white goods and building products group, is to pay
ADollars 326.5m (USDollars 220.3m) for a number of buildings products
businesses from National Consolidated (NCL), writes Bruce Jacques.
NCL, part of the troubled Adsteam group, said the sale price would yield a
book profit of about ADollars 132m. This would be used to reduce borrowings.
Email said the businesses acquired were expected to have sales of ADollars
310m, and earnings before interest and tax of ADollars 28m. The deal will
lift Email's turnover to around ADollars 1.8bn.
