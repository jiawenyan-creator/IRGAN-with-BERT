  [Text] Budapest, 15 May (MTI) -- The Independent 
Smallholders' Party (FKGP) has become legitimate in the course 
of the first round of parliamentary elections in Hungary on May 
8. Based on votes cast for the party lists, the FKGP has 
entered parliament, and is preparing for a constructive 
parliamentary opposition role, FKGP Chairman Jozsef Torgyan said 
on Sunday, at an election rally held in Lenti (SW Hungary). 
Torgyan said his party wishes to become the conscience of the 
nation and wishes to call to account the election programmes and 
promises of all political parties in parliament in this spirit. 
  The FKGP chairman said that among their first tasks will be 
to press for putting the economy in order, transforming the bad 
distribution systems and privatization, and preparing for a 
bicameral parliamentary system. Torgyan said the smallholders 
will fight for the enforcement of Hungarian interests in all 
walks of life, particularly in economy, and on an appropriate 
level. 
  As regards the second round of elections on May 29, Torgyan 
was of the opinion that those who cast their votes for the 
Socialists and the free democrats, vote for the strengthening of 
a liberal-communist policy. Those who vote for the smallholders 
support the genuine strength of the right-wing. He added the 
FKGP counts on the votes of the Christian Democrats and "the 
honest members of the Hungarian Democratic Forum".
