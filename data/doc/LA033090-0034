SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON 
A doctor who had been charged with plotting to kill his wife, also a doctor, 
was sentenced Thursday to perform 200 hours of community service after having 
plead guilty to a lesser charge. 
In December, Dr. Ashok Gidwani, 40, was accused of soliciting a former patient 
to kill his wife, Dr. Lata Gidwani, 39. 
Both are from India. His wife, a pathologist, appeared in court in December to 
show her support for her husband and told police she did not believe he 
intended to hurt her. In February, Gidwani pleaded guilty to the charge of 
solicitation to commit an assault. 
The orthopedic surgeon could have been sentenced to a maximum of three years in 
prison and a $10,000 fine. 
Instead Municipal Judge Frank Brown ordered Gidwani to perform the community 
service, to pay at $200 fine, and placed him on three years probation. 
The Gidwanis were wed in 1975 in a traditional Indian prearranged marriage.
