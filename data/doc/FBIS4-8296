  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/4/1994 -- The government's 
daily VOCEA ROMANIEI writes in a comment on the recent visit in 
Bucharest of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic that Romania 
has recently launched a diplomatic offensive in the Balkans," 
starting from its position of stability in the area and its 
yearnings to reach a mediator's status. 
  "Preceded by meetings with dignitaries from neighbouring 
states, such as the presidents of Croatia, Turkey and Greece, to 
be soon followed by the visit of Bosnia's president, the 
presence of Milosevic in Bucharest is a confirmation of 
Romania's being a centre of stability in the Balkans, that it 
has a chance to make a step forward on the political scene, with 
good consequences for the Romanian diplomacy, adds the daily. 
  Even if the area of conflict has shrunk to former 
Yugoslavia, 
one cannot underestimate the conflict that could readily 
encompass other states. Potential hotbeds also exist between 
Greece and Turkey, Greece and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia], Albania and the present Republic of 
Yugoslavia, that includes the province of Kosovo, 90 percent of 
whose population is formed by Albanians, who also claim 
autonomy, adds VOCEA ROMANIEI. 
  The commentator analyses Russia's position in the area: 
"With 
its roads to the West cut short, Russia looks at the Balkans, as 
it has always done in such situations, where it has always found 
good ground for its pan-Slavic tendencies. As a matter of fact, 
following the agreement between Bosnia's Croats and Muslims, 
backed by Washington and far from being unknown to Moscow, 
Western political analysts do not refrain from calling the peace 
negotiations in Bosnia, with the involvement of the White House 
and the Kremlin, "a small-scale Yalta." Everybody knows what 
Yalta was for Romania. What we don't know is what it can mean 
this time, that is why we think the recent diplomatic offensive 
of Romania to be welcome," concludes VOCEA ROMANIEI.
