MORNING REPORT: STAGE 
After-Christmas Present: The La Jolla Playhouse is facing a cheerier new year, 
thanks to a $400,000 gift from the Joan B. Kroc Foundation. Kroc is the widow 
of Ray Kroc, founder of McDonald's. The grant, which enabled the Playhouse to 
balance its 1989 operations budget, is separate from the theater's current 
financial stabilization campaign, which is lobbying to raise $1 million by June 
30. Claudia Puig
