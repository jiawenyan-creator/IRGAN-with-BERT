FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Terry's sale greeted with relief
RELIEF WAS the dominant emotion yesterday at Terry's Chocolate Works in
York, after staff heard that the company had been sold to Kraft General
Foods International for Pounds 220m.
'The general reaction is, thank God it's all over,' said Mr Vic Botterill,
chief shop steward at the factory for the General Municipal Boilermakers
Union, which represents the plant's 800 blue collar employees and up to 200
casual workers.
Mr Botterill said the sale to KGFI, part of Philip Morris, the large US
tobacco and foods group, could allow the Chocolate Works, source of
chocolate oranges and the All Gold and Moonlight ranges to gain some more
lines.
He said the employees were glad that Terry's had not been sold to Cadbury
Schweppes or Nestle, because of their competing product ranges. There had
been fears, he said, that such a deal could have resulted in product ranges
being moved from Terry's York plant.
'We have the facilities here, we have the potential: it's a big world out
there,' said Mr Botterill.
There was some sadness, he added, that United Biscuits had sold. 'Everybody
slags off employers but they've put in a lot of investment.'
Terry's was founded in 1767 by two citrus peel importers, who opened a shop
making and selling sweets in Bootham, York. In 1823 they were joined by an
apothecary, Mr Joseph Terry. Subsequent expansion led the company to its
present imposing five-storey building, often glimpsed on television
broadcasts of horse racing from York.
Despite its strong tourist image, York has traditionally had an important
manufacturing base, founded on the twin pillars of the railways and
confectionery.
Terry's, with just over 1,000 employees, is the second biggest confectioner.
Nestle employs 4,500 in the city and Cravens about 600.
