TELEVISION REVIEWS ; 
'JAZZ MESSENGER' LACKS A MESSAGE 
Scheduled as it is on KCET Channel 28 at 11 tonight right after a rerun of the 
magnificent two-hour documentary "A Duke Named Ellington," the hourlong program 
entitled "Art Blakey: The Jazz Messenger" will come as an anti-climax. 
The fault is not Blakey's, but that of the film makers. Not a single piece of 
music runs its course without interruption in this farrago of voice-overs and 
on-camera colloquy. Many of the speakers are unidentified; some are no doubt 
well-known Blakey alumni, while others, presumably fans, have Cockney accents 
(the film was made mainly in Britain). 
Anyone who watches the show hoping to hear the veteran drummer play a concert 
with his band will find, instead, a mishmash of aborted performances, 
rehearsals and less-than-enlightening commentary, the best of which is supplied 
by Dizzy Gillespie. There are a few admirable passages from some of Blakey's 
early hits, played by trumpeter Terence Blanchard and other recent members, but 
these two are cut short. 
It is fortunate that admirers of the Messengers can hear Blakey and his current 
septet in person at Catalina's in Hollywood, where they will be on hand through 
Sunday, without voice-overs. Here is an outstanding example of live music 
beating out the ersatz taped product. Meanwhile, the definitive documentary on 
this jazz giant has yet to be produced. LEONARD FEATHER
