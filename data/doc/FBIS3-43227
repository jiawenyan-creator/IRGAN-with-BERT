  [Text] Within the framework of establishing transitional 
institutions to include the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the 
republican National Movement for Democracy and Development 
[MRND], [words indistinct] Hotel, Umubano. In the opinion of 
the MRND, the responsibility for the stalemate can only be 
blamed on the current prime minister and on the person who will 
lead the great transition. Here is MRND national Secretary 
Joseph Nzirorera: 
  [Begin Nzirorera recording] The MRND feels that the 
blackmail and tricks of outgoing Prime Minister Agathe 
Uwilingiyimana and of Faustin Twagiramungu, prime 
minister-designate of the transitional broad-based government, 
constitute a serious handicap to the process of peace and 
democratization in which our country is resolutely engaged. 
  The MRND feels that the stalemate in the establishment of 
the 
institutions stipulated in the Arusha Accord is mainly to be 
blamed on the prime minister-[designate] of the transitional 
broad-based government, who does not want to fully implement the 
accord from the Arusha negotiations, and instead indulges in 
meddling in the internal conflicts of parties in order to defend 
partisan and disreputable interests. 
  The MRND strongly denounces the prime minister's 
interference 
in the internal affairs of political parties which are called 
upon to participate in the transitional institutions. The MRND 
was surprised by the behavior, which resembled that of the 
minister of foreign affairs and cooperation, of outgoing Prime 
Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, who unilaterally announced the 
date of the establishment of the transitional institutions and 
went on to accuse the president of the Republic of not wanting 
to take the oath before the Constitutional Court, although she 
well knew that negotiations were still in progress and far from 
being concluded. [end recording]
