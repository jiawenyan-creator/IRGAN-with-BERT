FT  16 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ukraine may export grain
UKRAINE'S MINISTER of Agriculture yesterday announced that he expects
Ukraine, which last year had to import grain, to export at least 2.2m tonnes
of grain and 500,000 tonnes of sugar this year.
Seeding is drawing to a close in Ukraine and Mr Karasyk said that the
combination of good weather and the beginning of economic reforms in the
agricultural sector would lead to a good harvest.
'It has been a very beautiful spring,' Mr Karasyk said. 'The weather is
working for our independence.'
Mr Karasyk predicted that a harvest of between 42m and 45m tonnes of grain
would be gathered this year, up from last year's yield of 40m tonnes, He
forecast a Ukrainian sugar beet crop of 40m tonnes, compared with the 33m
tonnes harvested last year, when the yield was sharply reduced by drought.
The agriculture minister vowed to resign if Ukraine imported any grain this
year and said the country needed foreign investments in the agricultural
infrastructure, not credits with which to buy western grain.
Mr Karasyk said that agricultural reforms were beginning to take root with
400,000 hectares already owned by private farmers. He said that 200,000 ha
were being cultivated jointly with western investors.
