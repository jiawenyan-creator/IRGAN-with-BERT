FT  15 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Presidents of G3 nations agree pact
The presidents of Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico - the Group of Three (G3) -
yesterday signed an agreement to phase in a free trade pact over 10 years
and create a common market of 140m people.
The pact, which comes into effect on January 1 1995, was thrashed out
between negotiators over the past three years and was signed on the eve of
the meeting of Ibero-American heads of state in Cartagena. Colombia's trade
minister, Mr Juan Manuel Santos, called the trade pact 'the most important
trade accord in Colombian history'.
Most agricultural products and the vehicle industry will have special
treatment.
The car sector, in which small Colombian and Venezuelan producers fear
competition from much larger Mexican competitors, is to be included over a
13-year period and Venezuela will also be given a two-year grace period
before it is compelled to dismantle textiles tariffs.
Colombia's industrialists have raised serious objections to the agreement
and recently asked the government not to sign it, saying that it favours
Mexico too strongly.
Although Congress still has to ratify the treaty, both presidential
candidates in Sunday's election have given it their support. The G3 partners
agreed to seek further free trade pacts with Central American and Caribbean
states and to build on the pact as a cornerstone of Latin American
integration. Ecuador has already shown interest in joining the G3.
Colombia and Venezuela also hope that the new agreement will be a step
towards joining the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mexico
entered on January 1.
Meanwhile, trade between Colombia and Venezuela, which soared during the
last two years, has again fallen in recent weeks as a result of a sharp
devaluation in the Venezuelan currency.
