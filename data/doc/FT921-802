FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Burmah Castrol static at Pounds 165m
BURMAH CASTROL, the lubricants, chemicals and fuels group, yesterday
announced virtually unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 165.5m, compared
with Pounds 164.9m , for the year 1991. Turnover showed a rise from Pounds
1.72bn to Pounds 2.35bn
The result, achieved against a background of depressed world markets and
adverse currency translation, were above expectations and the shares
advanced 41p to 523p.
The dividend is raised by 4 per cent. The market was also relieved that the
company had finally disposed of surplus assets from Foseco, the speciality
chemicals company which it bought for Pounds 260m at the end of 1990.
Earlier this week Burmah sold Foseco's ceramics, abrasives and diamond
products businesses for Pounds 44m. The price was well below what Burmah had
hoped for at the time of the acquisition, but the group's shares had fallen
as low as 464p in December when fears grew that no disposal would be
possible in the current market conditions.
The group's core lubricants business made record trading profits and
expanded its market share despite depressed world markets.
Mr Lawrence Uquhart, chairman, said he was 'pleased, but not smug' about the
results. He also detected the 'first glimmerings' of a recovery in consumer
demand in the US.
Of group turnover the Foseco companies contributed Pounds 520m. Underlying
growth was 4 per cent.
The company said that the initial Foseco acquisition costs and increase in
overseas profits increased tax by Pounds 15.8m to Pounds 77.3m, lifting the
effective tax rate from 37 per cent to 47 per cent.
Earnings per share fell by 19 per cent to 42.6p (52.9p). A final dividend of
15.5p (14.5p) gives a total for the year of 24p (23p).
Mr Lawrence said he was still confident that Foseco had been bought at a
good price, but said his group had underestimated the effect of the
recession.
In the event, Foseco had diluted the enlarged group's earnings by about 6.5p
per share, about double the degree of dilution he had expected at the time
of the acquisition.
Burmah said it had decided to dispose of its 64 per cent interest in
Pakistan Petroleum and other downstream companies there after failing to get
a better gas price agreement with the Pakistan government, which owns 30 per
cent of the company.
Burmah had written down the book value of these assets to costs by an
extraordinary provision of Pounds 31.4m. The company said it hoped the
disposals would raise between Pounds 20m-Pounds 40m.
