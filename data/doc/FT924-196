FT  30 DEC 92 / US-Russian space joint venture
LOCKHEED, one of the largest US defence contractors, is joining forces with
Khrunichev Enterprise, the Russian aerospace company, in a commercial space
venture which will focus on the marketing of Khrunichev's Proton launch
vehicle.
Under the deal, the two companies have set up a joint venture entity, called
Lockheed-Khrunichev International (LKI). This will act as the marketing arm
worldwide for the Proton launch vehicles and future derivative products. The
financial details of the joint venture arrangement were not disclosed.
The companies said that the formation of LKI followed months of talks on
potential co-operative business ventures, and that the US Department of
State had provided an initial authorisation for the commercial space
venture. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, has also
approved the link-up between the two companies.
Commenting on the joint venture, Mr Dan Tellep, Lockheed chairman, said that
it should prove 'a highly positive and forward-looking arrangement' that
would benefit both sides. The Proton rockets are expected to compete
strongly with European launch vehicles, notably the launch business of
Arianespace, the French consortium.
Lockheed, head-quartered in Calabasas, California, is a broadly-based
defence company but its missiles and space company division is involved in
the design and production of space systems technology, electronic systems
and satellites.
Yesterday, the US company's shares closed at Dollars 56 5/8 , down Dollars 1
1/4 .
