FT  02 MAR 94 / China may enter Gatt 'this year'
Sir Leon Brittan, European trade commissioner, said he believed China could
enter Gatt this year and trade and human rights should be dealt with
separately, Reuter reports from Beijing.
Sir Leon was speaking after two days of talks with Chinese officials on
Sino-EU economic relations.
There would be complex negotiations to agree the nature of the commitments
more precisely and the schedule of timing acceptable to the EU, he added.
The EU is seeking cuts in tariffs, greater transparency, improved access for
its companies into sectors such as distribution, banks and insurance
companies, and a safeguard clause against surges in Chinese exports.
Sir Leon gave Chinese officials a protocol on Gatt entry with a list of
requirements. China was a founder member of Gatt but left after the
Communist takeover in 1949. It applied to rejoin in 1986.
Sir Leon also raised the issue of what he called serious violations of
intellectual property rights. The capacity of China's compact disc industry
was enormous but in the absence of agreements with foreign companies it
created an incentive for piracy, he declared.
