As discussed in detail in the initial order granting PTC's temporary registration,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 one of the primary reasons for PTC's registration was to develop depository facilities for mortgage-backed securities,
particularly securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (``GNMA''). PTC services
include certificate safekeeping, book entry deliveries, an automated facility for the pledge or segregation of
securities, and other services related to the immobilization of securities certificates.
