  [Text] The largest company in Russia is freezing 
prices of petroleum and petroleum products. 
  This sensational announcement was made on Monday at a 
news conference of the Lukoil Petroleum company by its vice 
president, Leonid Fedun: The company's leaders have decided to 
freeze prices of the petroleum and petroleum products it 
produces during the second quarter of 1994 at the level of 
prices of the first quarter. 
  "This is a purely economic step," emphasized L. Fedun. "As 
calculations show, Russia's current overproduction of petroleum 
and petroleum products amounts to 25-30 percent of the overall 
volume. At the same time the potential capacity of the petroleum 
complex exceeds the overall demand of the country's enterprises 
1.5- to twofold. Taking into account the constant reduction of 
the effective demand, the real demand for petroleum and 
petroleum products amounts to about 60 percent of production and 
has a tendency toward further decline. 
  Under these conditions raising the price of oil is 
economically inexpedient. The only effective means of preventing 
a fatal development of events is for the country's largest 
producers to maintain the existing price level for their 
products.
