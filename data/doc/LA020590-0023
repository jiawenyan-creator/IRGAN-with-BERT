MORNING REPORT: PEOPLEWATCH 
Barr's Love Letters at Large: Love letters written by actress Roseanne Barr to 
Tom Arnold, her newlywed husband, have been stolen and are being offered for 
sale to various periodicals. 
Barr's publicist Alana Rothstein announced the theft Friday. "Our purpose in 
sending the (announcement) out is to notify people that these letters are 
stolen," Rothstein said. "We're saying, 'yes it is for real, and yes they are 
stolen, and if somebody decides to publish them, then down the road they'll 
have to deal with the repercussions.' " Barr's public relations firm had 
received inquiries from several publishers who had been contacted by someone 
who was offering to sell the letters. BETH KLEID
