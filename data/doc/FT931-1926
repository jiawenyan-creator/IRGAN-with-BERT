FT  23 MAR 93 / Observer: Marxism today?
It's Marx out and Spencer in for China's top bureaucrats when they pop back
to the Communist party school at the People's University of China in Beijing
for a refresher course. According to the Times Higher Educational
Supplement, the party school is sprucing up its programmes to meet the needs
of a 'socialist market economy'.
So out go 17 specialisms, including scientific socialism, the science of
national economic planning, the international communist movement and marxist
ethics. In come 14 new courses such as marketing, human resources
management, real estate, international trade, taxation and international
business management.
Required reading among high-level government officials and economists will
soon be Tom Peters and Peter Drucker, rather than Marx or Mao, as
dialectical materialism gives way to double entry bookkeeping.
