FT  16 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Dalgety
Recession may have taken a bite out of the dog population, but Dalgety seems
to have survived intact. The company's solid performance owes more to its
agricultural business, though, than to the more fashionable snacks and pet
food markets. Indeed the strength of the agricultural supplies operation is
underlined by the apparently effortless way in which prices have been
increased by 20 per cent in the last six months.
Under Maurice Warren the company has rationalised its businesses,
strengthened its balance sheet and lived up to the food manufacturing
sector's defensive image. Still, this has all been reflected in the
company's share price. Doubts about future growth go beyond the market's
current obsession with cyclical shares.
Most promising areas for expansion in Europe are snacks and pet foods, but
both are dominated by larger players. With many continentals still feeding
Fido scraps, increasing the size of the pet food market may offer the best
opportunities. Dalgety, however, would require a deal with the likes of
Quaker to mount an effective challenge to Pedigree Petfoods.
The company's weak strategic position in such markets leaves it open to
attack. Dalgety is also less able to absorb the dilutive impact of
highly-priced acquisitions than its larger competitors. The European food
manufacturing industry demands deeper pockets than Dalgety currently has.
