FT  30 APR 93 / Pounds 30m of dole overpaid, says NAO
AN ESTIMATED Pounds 30m of unemployment benefit was paid in 1991-92 to
claimants who were not entitled to it, the National Audit Office, says.
The public expenditure watchdog has qualified the accounts of the National
Insurance Fund as a result - the fifth year in succession that the accounts
have been qualified for this reason.
Errors also led to underpayment of Pounds 12m of benefit. The majority of
the mistakes arose because the Employment Service, which pays out the
benefit, misinterpreted claimants' national insurance contribution records.
Measures to strengthen procedures for paying benefits have been introduced
since the errors were first identified in 1987-88. But according to the NAO
the 1991-92 errors amounted to 5.5 per cent of the benefit paid, the same
level as in 1987-88.
In response to the criticisms the Employment Service said that it worked
towards accuracy targets negotiated by its chief executive with the social
security secretary. Its target for 1992-93 was that errors should not exceed
4 per cent of the value of unemployment benefit paid. The NAO has also
qualified the fund's accounts for two other reasons:
Uncertainty about the accuracy of national insurance contributions paid by
employers - many of the checks carried out on these contributions can
operate only when employers' returns are received after the end of the
financial year, and there is a large backlog of inquiries.
Doubts about estimates of the amount of statutory sick pay and statutory
maternity pay which employers are entitled to deduct from national insurance
contributions. The NAO says that the Social Security department controls
over these deductions are inadequate.
