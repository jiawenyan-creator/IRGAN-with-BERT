CELLIST ABDUCTED FROM CAMPUS 
A 23-year-old UCLA student who plays cello in the El Camino College Symphony 
was abducted Sunday from the Gardena campus where she had gone for a rehearsal, 
authorities said. 
Lynne Marie Carlucci of Torrance was forced into her car in a parking lot on 
the campus at 16007 Crenshaw Blvd. and driven away by two men who appeared to 
be in their 20s, witnesses said. 
Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators said she is 5-feet-3, 120 pounds, 
with shoulder-length blond hair and blue eyes. She was last seen wearing a 
knee-length blue dress, deputies said. Her car is a faded red 1985 Nissan 
Sentra two-door with California license plate number 1LRC307, said Deputy 
Rafael Estrada. 
Her father, Don Carlucci, said she was to play the cello with the El Camino 
Symphony at 3 p.m. and then celebrate her 23rd birthday, which fell on Tuesday, 
with her family. 
Her father said she had just finished her junior year as an environmental 
geography student at UCLA and that she lives with a sister and a roommate. He 
described her as "on the quiet side, very intelligent and very likable and 
friendly." 
"It has been eight hours since she was abducted, you would think they would 
have located the car," a worried Carlucci added. 
One of the kidnapers was wearing a blue jacket, deputies said. Both abductors 
were described as being about 140 to 150 pounds.
