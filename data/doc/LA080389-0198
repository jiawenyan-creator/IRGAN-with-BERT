LOCAL; 
ORANGE COUNTY HOLDING SEATTLE TEEN, 2 OTHERS IN MOTHER'S DEATH 
A 15-year-old Seattle boy who turned himself in to Garden Grove police is one 
of three youths suspected in the stabbing death of his mother, Seattle 
detectives said today. 
Dan Donohoe, a spokesman for the King County prosecutor's office, said the boy 
left Seattle after his mother was found dead in her apartment July 26. The 
woman, Ange May Reed, had been stabbed in the face and the neck. 
The boy called Garden Grove police from a telephone booth at Bolsa Grande High 
School about 8:15 p.m. Wednesday and later was arrested, Garden Grove Lt. John 
Wood said. 
The youth was taken to Orange County Juvenile Hall in Orange, where Seattle 
detectives were to pick him up today to face first-degree murder charges in 
Seattle, Seattle police spokesman Don Church said. 
Donohoe said the boy discussed killing his mother with two friends, one of whom 
later carried out the stabbing. Donohoe said the other youth, a juvenile, is 
also wanted on suspicion of first-degree murder. 
Donohoe said all three of the youths are members of a Seattle-area gang and 
fled Washington for California after Reed's death. Seattle police apparently 
knew that the boy was heading to Orange County and issued a bulletin alerting 
Orange County authorities, Garden Grove Police Lt. Chuck Gibbs said.
