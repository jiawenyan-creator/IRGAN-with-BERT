  [Text] Kiev March 22 TASS -- U.S. Defence Secretary William 
Perry has been the first foreign defence minister to visit a 
strategic missile unit in Pervomaysk, Ukraine, and a classified 
military plant in Dnepropetrovsk. 
  Ukraine ranks the world's third in the number of nuclear 
warheads stationed on its territory. It is preceded only by the 
United States and Russia. Two types of missiles are stationed 
in Pervomaysk, the Nikolayev region. Part of missiles have been 
dismantled. 
  The U.S. Pentagon head visited a dismantled missile silo to 
see a de-activated SS-24 missile. The secretary was told by 
Ukrainian servicemen that warheads have been removed from 30 
SS-24 missiles and eleven SS-19 missiles. All in all, this will 
be done to 46 SS- 24 and 30 SS-19 missiles. 
  Last year Ukrainian specialists took off duty two regiments 
of strategic missiles. One of them to include ten systems was 
withdrawn from Pervomaysk. Nuclear warheads have been 
dismantled and sent to technical storages, missiles have been 
removed from silos, fuel and oxidizer were put into special 
tanks, loaded into freight cars and set to the Yuzhmash plant in 
Dnepropetrovsk. 
  The U.S. defence secretary visited the Yuzhmash plant, which 
earlier produced the world's only high-precision heavy missiles 
capable to deliver up to ten warheads of megaton weight. The 
plant and its design bureau produced four generations of 
intercontinental ballistic missiles and made the first 
artificial earth satellite of the Cosmos series together with 
the rocket booster. 
  Now the plant continues to produce space equipment, 
simultaneously with first Ukrainian trolley-buses and wind 
engines.
