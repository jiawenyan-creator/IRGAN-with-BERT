Four sports agents charged with signing former University of Florida athletes 
to secret contracts also have been accused of withholding tax returns to the 
Internal Revenue Service and failing to provide accurate information to the 
U.S. Department of Education. 
Agents Gerald Gratenstein, Gregory Latimer, John Kasbar and Glenn Haft are 
scheduled to go on trial Monday on charges they defrauded Florida and two 
smaller schools with secret payments to basketball player Vernon Maxwell and 
five football players who played all or part of their college careers with the 
Gators. 
The government contends those secret payments voided the athletes' amateur 
eligibility, and because the agents helped hide the payments from university 
officials, they defrauded the university of scholarship money the athletes 
never should have received.
