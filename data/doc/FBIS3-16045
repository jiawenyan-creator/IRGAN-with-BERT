  [Text] Vilnius, March 11, ELTA -- Two thirds of all the 
crimes in Lithuania are committed by persons until 29 year-old 
and the majority of them are minors, Interior ministry told ELTA 
[sentence as received]. 
  Mostly, children without business commit crimes -- who do 
not 
attend school, have no parents or one of them, also children of 
unemployed people. 
  Major part of crimes are made in places attended by young 
people - hostels, cafes, discotheques, in cities of Vilnius and 
Klaipeda, regions of Kupiskis, Anyksciai, Moletai. Four fifths 
of youth crimes are thefts of property. The rest part is 
murders and rapes. 
  Age of criminals is diminishing. In 1990, the youngest 
criminals were of 12-13 years, in 1993 -- nine-year-olds. About 
a half crimes are committed by youngsters abusing various 
intoxicants.
