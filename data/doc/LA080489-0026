FAIR TO THE FAIR? 
Thank you very much for your coverage of the 1989 San Fernando Valley Fair! 
On behalf of my Future Farmers of America students, I also wish to express our 
deepest thanks to the members of the 51st Fair District. 
The directors made a commitment and a promise to the students that a fair would 
be held in 1989. How easy it would have been to let this year go without a fair 
with all the uncertainties and obstacles that had to be overcome. Yet, to my 
students, not having a fair would have been a financial disaster. Many of their 
large livestock bank loans would have defaulted, and the students would have 
literally "eaten" their project loans. 
To the critics of the fair, I ask how nearsighted can one be! Although 
agriculture production is rapidly disappearing from the Valley, agricultural 
sales and services, veterinary services and the nursery industry are alive and 
well in the Valley and Los Angeles. Los Angeles County is still among the top 
20 counties in the state in agricultural receipts and growing stronger due to 
the boom in the nursery and landscape industries. 
One of the biggest attractions at the fair was the Horticulture Exhibit, where 
not only veterans were able to display their produce, but budding 
horticulturists displayed their talents by designing and constructing landscape 
exhibits. 
The fair was an educational bonanza to each and every visitor. It still amazes 
me the number of high school students who firmly believe that eggs, milk and 
produce come from the local supermarket, prepackaged and ready to eat. The 
bottom line is that the fair allows the opportunity to educate our youth in the 
realities of the real world.
