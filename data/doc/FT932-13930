FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: St Ives edges ahead to Pounds 10.5m
ST IVES, the UK's largest independent printer, withstood the recession by
reporting a 4 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the half year to
January 29.
Profits rose from Pounds 10.1m in the comparable half year to Pounds 10.5m,
on reduced sales of Pounds 108m (Pounds 109m).
Mr Robert Gavron, chairman, said he was looking to make a takeover either in
the UK or on the Continent.
'Its not a high urgency and we have to be very careful since a bad
acquisition can spoil a company. But we are looking at a number of
companies.'
He expects that an upturn in his company's markets is on the way and
believes it will make 'reasonable progress' next year.
Despite the adverse effect of the translation of St Ives' US borrowings, as
the pound depreciated against the dollar, it ended the half year with a cash
balance of Pounds 13.6m.
Interest receivable increased from Pounds 973,000 to Pounds 1.4m while
interest payable fell from Pounds 810,000 to Pounds 714,000.
The US subsidiary reversed from a Pounds 278,000 first-half loss to a Pounds
304,000 profit.
The main UK division reported a fall in profit before interest, from Pounds
10m to Pounds 8.8m, while the rest of the world saw profits rise from Pounds
157,000 to Pounds 701,000.
Overall operating profit fell marginally from Pounds 9.96m to Pounds 9.86m.
The company has won the printing contract for the forthcoming sale of the UK
government's shares in BT.
As a result of the increase in the effective rate of tax, earnings per share
were slightly reduced from 7.3p to 7.2p.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p.
COMMENT
St Ives' decision to spend Pounds 130m over the past four years on some of
the most advanced printing presses in the world looks to have been a wise
one. Its high operational gearing should allow it to benefit very quickly
from the expected upturn. The printing presses are now running at almost 80
per cent of their capacity and should shortly run at full speed if the
industry makes a complete recovery. With net cash of more than Pounds 13m
and a high rating it should be able to pull off its long-awaited
acquisition. If this is in the expected price range of Pounds 30m to Pounds
50m it will not dilute earnings. With forecast full year pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 22.2m, the shares - down 6p yesterday at 337p - are on a
prospective multiple of 22. The expected recovery is well reflected in its
rating.
