FT  01 JUN 92 / Philippine poll result by June 15
The winner in the May 11 Philippine presidential election could be
proclaimed by Congress, which is conducting an official vote count, on or
about June 15, writes Jose Galang in Manila. Mr Fidel Ramos, the 'annointed'
candidate of President Corazon Aquino, who led during the unofficial count,
claimed victory over the weekend, although opponents dismissed this as
premature.
