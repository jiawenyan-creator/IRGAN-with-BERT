  [Text] The [Orange] Free State National Party [NP] Congress 
has elected a new leader to replace Mr. Kobie Coetsee, who has 
been appointed president of the Senate. The new leader, Mr. 
Enos Aucamp, is also a member of the Free State legislature. In 
his acceptance speech, Mr. Aucamp said the local government 
elections would be the first opportunity for the NP to prove 
itself. He added that the NP would have to strengthen its 
organization and finances and plan well for the next national 
elections. Mr. Coetsee said the NP would have to win at least 
between 600,000 and 700,000 votes in the next national election 
to ensure its continued existence.
