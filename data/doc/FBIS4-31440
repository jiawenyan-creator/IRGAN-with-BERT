Results of the Elections for Local Government in Some Communes 
of Albania"] 
  [Text] Tirana, June 7 (ATA) -- The Democratic Party of 
Albania reports that the latest elections which were conducted 
in over 30 villages of five communes are a great victory for 
this party. In these elections the DP [Democratic Party] took 
80 per cent of the votes for the leading staff in the communes 
and 66 per cent of the votes. In Zall-Herr the DP received 32 
per cent of the votes a week ago while in yesterday's elections, 
due to an intensive work and understanding with the Republican 
Party, the DP won 56 per cent of the votes. 
  The final results of the elections in the five communes are 
as follows: 
  1. Zall-Rec -- The DP won 55 per cent and the SP [Socialist 
Party] 19 per cent of the votes. 
  2. Zall-Herr -- The DP won 56 per cent and the SP 44 per 
cent. 
  3. Libofshe -- The DP won 68 per cent and the SP 28 per 
cent. 
  4. Ngracan -- The DP won 66 per cent and the SP 34 per cent. 
  5. Greshice -- The DP won 40 per cent and the SP 56 per 
cent. 
  The DP considers the elections an important victory and a 
development of democracy because considering the geographic 
extension and the number of voters, these elections were a 
really great test of general values. 
  Making an analysis of the latest elections and due to its 
program, it comes out that the DP has won 42.2 per cent more 
votes which in the elections of July 22, 1992 had been cast for 
the SP. This great defeat of the SP is related with the fact 
that when electors seek alternatives, the only one the SP 
presents them is destruction, the statement says in conclusion.
