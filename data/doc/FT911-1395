FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: Correction
In my review of Black Snow at the Cottesloe in last Saturday's paper, the
role of one of the secretaries at the Moscow Arts Theatre was attributed to
Elizabeth Bradley rather than Gillian Barge. There are two secretaries in
the play, both of whom play other parts as well and both are uniformly
excellent. Apologies to Ms Bradley and Ms Barge for any confusion.
