DEADLINE FOR QUAKE REPAIR IS EXTENDED 
The Torrance City Council voted unanimously to extend by two months a deadline 
for obtaining building permits for renovation of pre-1933 masonry buildings to 
meet new earthquake codes. 
The extension, which was approved with little discussion Tuesday, gives owners 
of older brick and wood buildings until Sept. 1 to take out the building 
permits. 
City officials said the extension also gives the city time to create a board of 
appeals to review applications for further deadline extensions. The board will 
be made up of one representative of the city Redevelopment Agency, the fire 
marshal and the city manager's office. 
As a result of the Whittier-Narrows Earthquake in October, 1987, the City 
Council in December, 1987, passed an ordinance requiring owners of pre-1933 
buildings to reinforce walls and ceilings with steel bolts. 
It required that property owners complete all repairs by July, 1991. 
About 14 landlords have requested an extension of the deadline, saying they 
could not find engineers to design renovation plans in time to meet the July 1 
cut-off date, city officials said. Some landlords have said the new 
requirements brought a backlog of contracts to many builders and engineers. 
There are 50 buildings, mostly in Old Downtown Torrance, that need 
earthquake-safety improvements. Renovations have been completed on six of those 
buildings, city officials said. 
An estimated 200 to 300 people occupy those buildings during the day and as 
many as 500 people live in them at night, city officials said. Most of them are 
apartments or restaurants.
