FT  05 SEP 92 / Bofors ruling is reversed
The Indian Supreme Court yesterday suspended a judgment by the Delhi High
Courtwhich would have halted investigations into the Rs14.5bn (Pounds 260m)
Bofors arms bribes scandal, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi.
The move ensures that six secret Swiss bank accounts frozen with the help of
the Swiss authorities, are not unfrozen, following the High Court's ruling
that there was nothing proven against Mr Win Chadha, the former Bofors agent
in India, and 13 others accused of receiving bribes from the Swedish arms
company for a large order in 1987.
