 

Also, the provisions of 23.1307(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3), are being removed from 23.1307. These requirements
have been previously added to 23.1361, 23.1351, and 23.1357, respectively; therefore, they are redundant
and may be removed. The designator for paragraph (c) has also been removed from the remaining text of this section.



Section 23.1309Equipment, Systems, and Installations


Proposed new 23.1309(a)(4) would correct an inadvertent omission that occurred when the FAA issued Amendment
No. 2341 (55 FR 43306, October 26, 1990). The omitted requirement was adopted by Amendment No. 2334 as
a portion of 23.1309(d) and read: ``In addition, for commuter category airplanes, system and installations
must be designed to safeguard against hazards to the airplane in the event of their malfunction or failure.'' (52 FR
1833, January 15, 1987.) To correct this oversight, and to continue the single fault provision of this paragraph,
23.1309(a)(4) is being proposed.



Section 23.1311Electronic Display Instrument Systems


This proposal would revise 23.1311 to remove redundant requirements and to clarify which secondary instruments
are required and the visibility requirements for these instruments. When 23.1311 was adopted by Amendment
No. 2341 (55 FR 43306, October 26, 1990), several nonsubstantive changes were made to the proposals in Notice
No. 896 (54 FR 9345, March 6, 1989) to remove the redundancy included in the notice. In the process certain provisions,
such as the one that permitted the installation of mechanical secondary instruments, were inadvertently omitted
from the final rule. Since the final rule, discussions with airplane manufacturer representatives have shown that
the requirements defining the instrument panel location where secondary instruments may be installed are also not
clear. Accordingly, the FAA is proposing to revise this section to correct and clarify these portions.

Current 23.1311(a), which requires electronic display indicator installations that are independent to
each pilot station, would be deleted because it is redundant with 23.1321(a). Section 23.1321(a) requires
that each flight, navigation, and powerplant instrument for use by any required pilot shall be located so that any
pilot seated at the controls can monitor the instruments with minimum head and eye movement. As stated in the preamble
of Notice No. 896 (54 FR 9345, March 6, 1989) regarding the proposed revision to 23.1321, ``This revision
also clarifies the rule relative to instrumentation that must be provided for each pilot required for type certification
or by the applicable operating rules. If a pilot is required by any applicable requirement, then that pilot must be
provided all instrumentation required for any operations for which the airplane is approved.'' Accordingly, the
requirements of current 23.1311(a) would be removed.

In place of current paragraph (a), proposed 23.1311(a) would be a revision of current paragraph (c) that would
clarify what instruments are required and the visibility of those instruments. Proposed new 23.1311(a)(1)
would require electronic display instrument installations to meet the arrangement and visibility requirements
of 23.1321(a).


Proposed 23.1311(a) (2), (3), and (4) would be redesignated with no changes from current 23.1311(c)
(1), (2), and (3).

Proposed 23.1311(a)(5) would continue the requirement of 23.1303(c) for a magnetic direction indicator
and, in addition, would require either an independent secondary mechanical altimeter, airspeed indicator, and
attitude indicator or individual electronic display indicators for the altimeter, airspeed, and attitude that
are independent from the airplane's primary electrical power. These secondary instruments may be installed in panel
positions other than the primary location as long as the selected location allows the pilot to properly monitor the
instruments and control the airplane.

The substance of proposed paragraph (a)(5) is both a substantive change and a combination of the current 23.1311(b),
which states that certain electronic display indicators must be independent of the airplane's electrical power
system, and current 23.1311(c)(4) which requires independent secondary attitude and rate-of-turn instruments
and specifies the location of those instruments. Proposed 23.1311(a)(5) would delete the requirement for
a rate-of-turn instrument (in current 23.1311(c)(4)) and specify that the required secondary instruments
are those that provide altitude, airspeed, magnetic direction, and attitude. The information that would be provided
by a secondary rate-of-turn instrument would not appreciably add to the safe operations of the airplane if the pilot
has the information provided by the secondary attitude instrument.

Current 23.1311(b) requires that electronic display indicators required by 23.1303 (a), (b), and
(c) be independent of the airplane's electrical power system. The original intent of the requirement for secondary
instruments, as stated in Notice No. 896, was to require the installation of either mechanical instruments
or independent electronic display indicators powered by a source independent of the airplane's electrical system.
However, the current rule does not clearly state this and does not address the installation of mechanical instruments.
Proposed 23.1311(a)(5), would allow either secondary electronic display indicators or mechanical instruments
to provide a crew with information essential for continued flight and landing in the event of failure in the airplane's
electrical power system.

Current 23.1311(c) (5) and (6) would be redesignated as 23.1311(a) (6) and (7) without change.

Proposed new 23.1311 (b) and (c) would continue the requirements of current 23.1311 (d) and (e) without
change.


Section 23.1321Arrangement and Visibility


The proposed revision to 23.1321(d) would remove the wording that limits the instrument location requirement
to airplanes certificated for flight under instrument flight rules or airplanes weighing more than 6,000 pounds.
Instruments are for the pilot and should be located near that pilot's vertical plane of vision without regard to what
flight rules are approved for the airplane's operation or the maximum weight of the airplane.
