FT  17 AUG 94 / Hanson lifted by Quantum: The group's progress towards
cutting debt
Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, yesterday reported a 10 per cent rise in
third-quarter pre-tax profits to Pounds 282m, from Pounds 256m.
Turnover grew 20 per cent to Pounds 2.77bn including a Pounds 344m
contribution from Quantum Chemical, acquired in September last year. The
Pounds 2.31bn sales of the April-June period in 1993 included Pounds 253m
from discontinued businesses.
Profit before exceptional costs increased to Pounds 282m, against Pounds
266m, in spite of a jump in the net interest bill to Pounds 57m, from Pounds
1m.
The results were towards the low end of analysts' estimates and Hanson's
shares closed  1/2 p lower at 264p.
With fully diluted earnings per share rising from 3.8p to 4.1p, the
quarterly dividend was increased from 2.85p to 3p, in line with market
expectations.
Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said: 'In the third quarter conditions
continued to improve and the outlook is good. Despite the expected adverse
interest swing of Pounds 56m, a negative of about Pounds 10m on foreign
exchange and no contribution from exceptionals, profit on ordinary
activities advanced positively including a very satisfying contribution of
Pounds 46m from Quantum.
'As expected, gearing has continued to improve,' he added.
Figures for the first nine months showed a 26 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits, from Pounds 763m to Pounds 965m. Hanson noted that the US coal
strike which affected its Peabody operations reduced pre-tax profits by
about Pounds 80m, compared with Pounds 50m in the year-ago period.
Pre-tax profits were bolstered by Pounds 331m (Pounds 30m) of gains on
disposals, which offset net interest costs of Pounds 176m compared with net
interest receipts of Pounds 35m in the same period last year.
Profit before exceptionals fell from Pounds 733m to Pounds 634m on turnover
which rose 16.5 per cent to Pounds 8.41bn. Quantum's chemicals and propane
operations contributed Pounds 1.19bn to sales and Pounds 116m to profits.
Discontinued operations contributed Pounds 337m (Pounds 644m) to turnover
and Pounds 27m (Pounds 71m) to profits. Fully diluted earnings per share
rose from 11.5p to 14p.
Peabody has reached a preliminary agreement to purchase the assets of Carter
Mining from US-based Exxon Coal on undisclosed terms. The deal includes
Exxon's low-sulphur Rawhide and Caballo coal mines near Gillette, Wyoming
which produced about 25m tons of coal last year and is expected to be
completed this autumn.
