BRIEFLY 
Texas Air Negotiating for Boeing Jets: Texas Air Corp. is reportedly 
negotiating to purchase a package of Boeing 737-300 jets worth as much as $2.8 
billion, with some delivery dates as early as 1991, airline analysts said. The 
Houston-based parent company of Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines 
confirmed that it has been talking to aircraft vendors, but declined to discuss 
any negotiations. The narrow-body Boeing jets would primarily serve 
Houston-based Continental. Unlike nearly all other major U.S. airlines, 
Continental has no new planes on order, posing potential problems should noise 
limits on older jets restrict the airline's operations in the 1990s.
