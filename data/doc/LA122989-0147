WORLD; 
QUEEN HANDS OUT 947 HONORS 
Britain today gave author V. S. Naipaul a knighthood, made actress Maggie Smith 
a dame and honored police and rescue workers in the search for victims of 
bombed Pan Am Flight 103. 
The colony of Hong Kong, to return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, also was 
heavily represented on Queen Elizabeth II's semiannual honors list, which is 
compiled by the government. The queen will carry out the investiture of the 947 
awards made in the New Year list at a later ceremony. 
Former New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange, whose anti-nuclear stance put 
him at odds with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was made a companion of 
honor, a prestigious order headed by the queen and never numbering more than 65 
members.
