  [Excerpt] On 23 March [as heard], leaders representing the 
Mobilization for National Development, the Front for Haitian 
Advancement and Progress, the National Conference, and the 
Congress of Haitian People for National Rescue met in 
Port-au-Prince and voted for a joint resolution enjoining 
parliament to conform to the following 
obligations: 

  -  Formally acknowledge Jean-Bertrand Aristide's 
deliberate refusal to appoint a prime minister; 
  -  Acknowledge the 
presidential vacuum; 
  -  Implement Article 149 of the Constitution 
by forming an ad hoc government to function under these 
exceptional circumstances; and 
  -  In case of nonexecution of the 
three aforementioned demands, bow to a national act of public 
power establishing an ad hoc government. 
  This resolution was to be officially delivered to the 
parliament on 29 March. Meanwhile, the Coordinating Committee 
for National Mobilization continues consultations with all of 
the country's sectors as a demonstration of support for the 
formation of the new government. [passage omitted]
