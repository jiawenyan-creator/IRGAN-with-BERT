<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations 
governing the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. The 
FFEL Program consists of the Federal Stafford, Federal 
Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS), Federal PLUS, and the 
Federal Consolidation Loan programs. These amendments are needed 
to implement changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as 
amended (HEA), by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. The 
proposed regulations would amend the FFEL Program loan 
cancellation provisions and enhance the ability of lenders and 
guaranty agencies to service and collect FFEL Program loans.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The Secretary is proposing to revise 34 CFR part 682 to 
implement changes made to the HEA by the Higher Education 
Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102325), enacted July 23, 1992, as 
well as certain changes added by Public Law 103208, enacted 
December 20, 1993. These regulations seek to improve the 
efficiency of federal student aid programs, and, by so doing, to 
improve their capacity to enhance opportunities for postsecondary 
education. 


Summary of Comments From Regional Meetings 


In compliance with section 492(a) of the HEA, the Secretary 
convened regional meetings during September 1992 to obtain public 
involvement in the development of proposed regulations. The 
purpose of the meetings was to ``provide for a comprehensive 
discussion and exchange of information concerning the 
implementation'' of certain parts of Public Law 102325. In 
addition, attendees at the regional meetings were asked to 
nominate individuals to act as negotiators in the negotiated 
rulemaking process required by section 492(b) of the HEA. 
The regional meetings were conducted for two days each in 
San Francisco, California; New York, New York; Atlanta, Georgia; 
and Kansas City, Missouri. Each participant at the regional 
meetings was assigned to one of six groups which were asked to 
discuss particular issue areas identified by the Department. 
Each group at the regional meetings prepared a report of its 
discussion and recommendations and those reports were presented 
to the Department for consideration during the preparation of the 
proposed regulations. 
The issues addressed in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
were discussed by one of the groups at each regional meeting. 
The specific recommendations made at those meetings are addressed 
below. The Secretary considered these comments in preparing 
draft proposed regulations. 


1. Loan Discharge for Borrowers Attending Schools That 
Close 


Public Law 102325 added section 437(c) to the HEA to provide 
that loans will be canceled for student borrowers who are unable 
to complete their program of study because the school closed. 
The specific issues described below were discussed in connection 
with this section.
