FT  25 NOV 94 / Property: Rental values edge up
For the first time since December 1990, rental values for all properties
have shown a positive movement, achieving a growth of 0.1 per cent in
October, according to Investment Property Databank, a research group.
The improvement has been led by a rental growth of 0.2 per cent in the
retail sector. For the second consecutive month capital values have shown a
downward movement, by -0.2 per cent.
This capital-value decline has fed into the all-property total return which,
although still positive, continues to slow, recording 0.4 per cent for
October.
The all-property equivalent yield has stabilised at 8.1 per cent, although
the underlying yield shift continues to move outward, standing at 0.02 for
October.
The rates of both capital growth and total return have continued to slow.
Year-on-year total return has declined by 1.6 per-centage points, achieving
22.0 per cent for the year to October.
Capital growth has slowed across all sectors with an all-property capital
growth of 12.6 per cent for the year to October, compared with 13.9 per cent
for the 12 months to September.
Retail continues to be the best-performing sector with a return of 0.6 per
cent, while industrials and offices lag behind returning 0.4 per cent and
0.2 per cent respectively.
