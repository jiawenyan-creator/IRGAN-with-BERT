An associate of Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. was sentenced in Leesburg, Va., to 10 
years in prison on securities violations stemming from the political 
extremist's fund-raising activities. Rochelle Ascher, 38, of Towson, Md., had 
been convicted on charges of selling an unregistered security with intent to 
defraud, sale of a security by an unregistered agent with intent to defraud and 
conspiracy, and six counts of securities fraud involving six sales to four 
individuals. Loudoun County Circuit Judge Carlton Penn sentenced Ascher to 56 
years and ordered that the sentences be served in such a way that her term in 
prison would be 10 years. State officials had maintained that Ascher, 15 
co-defendants and five LaRouche organizations allegedly bilked hundreds of 
people out of as much as $30 million.
