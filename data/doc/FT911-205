FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): NUM offers to back bank staff
THE National Union of Mineworkers has offered to back a recognition claim by
the banking union Bifu at the North of England Building Society by urging
NUM members to withdraw their savings from the society. Miners and ex-miners
have substantial sums of redundancy money invested.
Bifu has not taken up the offer 'for the moment', it said, because the move
could threaten the livelihood of its members.
