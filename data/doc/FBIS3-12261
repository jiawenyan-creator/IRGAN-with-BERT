  [Excerpts] Capitals, 26 Feb (SANA)--Denunciation and 
condemnation of the unprecedented ugly crime and bestial 
massacre, in which scores of believers were martyred or wounded 
at the hands of the Zionists in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque 
yesterday, are continuing. [passage omitted] 
  PLO Executive Committee member Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi 
condemned the ugly massacre perpetrated by the Zionist settlers 
in collusion with the occupation forces. Reached by telephone 
today, al-Nashashibi told SANA that the massacre crowns the 
arbitrary measures being practiced by the Israeli occupation 
authorities against the Palestinan Arab people to prevent them 
from regaining their full national rights. 
  Al-Nashashibi called for stopping the PLO's negotiations 
with 
Israel and for moving immediately to negotiations on the 
comprehensive and final status on the basis of the Israeli 
forces' withdrawal from all the occupied territories in 
accordance with the resolutions of the international legitimacy 
which can secure the Palestinian Arab people's rights and 
achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the region. [passage
