FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Thames settles movie rights row with ITV
Association
THAMES TELEVISION and the ITV Association yesterday reached an out-of-court
settlement in their row over film rights.
Under the deal, Carlton Television, which takes over the London weekday ITV
licence from Thames on January 1, will pay a total of Pounds 13.1m for the
right to show several hundred films in the London area.
Thames will get Pounds 8.5m on January 1 and Carlton will also take on
liabilities of Dollars 7.27m (Pounds 4.78m) for film rights bought but not
yet paid for.
Before yesterday's settlement - just before a High Court case was due to be
heard - Carlton had offered a total of Pounds 6.8m, including liabilities.
Thames issued writs against the ITV Association after the television trade
body decided that film rights were bought collectively by the ITV system and
could not be retained by Thames when it was no longer an ITV company.
The ITV Association said it was removing Thames rights over the films and
only giving it use of the films until the end of December. ITV also claimed
the right to arbitrate on any compensation for Thames.
Yesterday's agreement left both sides happy. The deal was Pounds 3.5m more
than the Thames book value of the rights and Carlton had budgeted a higher
amount.
As a result, several hundred films will not be available to Thames to show
on Channel 5 if the Independent Television Commission decides the new
channel should go ahead.
Thames, its parent Thorn EMI and Time Warner have effectively underwritten
70 per cent of the financing of the Pounds 150m venture. A number of other
potential shareholders, including Pearson, owner of the Financial Times and
Cox, the large US media group, have also written to the ITC saying they are
interested in investing.
The ITC will decide on Thursday whether or not the Thames-led bid - the only
one to be submitted - has passed the quality threshold on financing and
programme plans.
