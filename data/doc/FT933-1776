FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Brixton Estate turns in 3.3% advance to
Pounds 13m
BRIXTON ESTATE, the UK's seventh largest property company, yesterday
announced a 3.3 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 12.6m to Pounds
13m for the six months ended June 30.
Mr Douglas Gardner, chairman, said there had been a marked increase in
activity in the property investment market over the past few months.
Brixton said that there had been an increased number of tenant inquiries,
which was likely to lead to a resumption of rental growth in the second half
of 1994.
Rental income increased by 13.8 per cent to Pounds 28.4m. Inter-est charges
rose from Pounds 11m to Pounds 13.9m, as the develop-ment programme was
completed.
In May, the company announced a two-for-five rights issue to raise Pounds
100.7m. Brixton has since spent Pounds 17m on London property. It intends to
invest the full proceeds of the rights issue on industrial buildings and
multi-let offices in the next year.
Brixton said it had completed rent reviews on more than 900,000 sq ft of UK
property, with average rent increases of over 14 per cent. About 7.5 per
cent of its UK offices are empty.
Overseas, Brixton expects rental income from its 650,000 sq ft of industrial
and warehouse space in Dusseldorf to increase during the year.
Earnings per share rose by 6.2 per cent to 5.99p (5.64p). The interim
dividend is increased by 2.4 per cent to 2.825p (2.76p) per share.
