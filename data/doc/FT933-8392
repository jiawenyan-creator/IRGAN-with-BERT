FT  16 AUG 93 / Observer: Unlucky
Talk about hard luck tales. There is a real humdinger in the latest issue of
The Antique Collector where the new Earl Spencer, Princess Diana's brother,
outlines 'the worst year of my life'.
The Earl inherited a family business which was losing Pounds 450,000 a year
when he took over. 'Every time I wake up in a cold sweat from the worry of
it all, I just think how empty my life would be without the challenge of
fighting for the survival of this lumbering endangered species.' Apparently,
he is talking about the family pile - 13,000 acres plus stately home -
rather than the family itself.
But it is not all the fault of the Earl's late father or his spendthrift
stepmother, Raine. 'My family has always sold the wrong thing,' says the
29-year-old Earl. His grandfather flogged a Holbein to Baron Thyssen for
Pounds 10,000 and now it's worth Pounds 55m. Worse still a great-great uncle
sold three villages in the 1830s. Unfortunately, they happened to be
Clapham, Wandsworth and Wimbledon.
