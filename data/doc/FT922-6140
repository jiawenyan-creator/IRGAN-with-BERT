FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Price increases help East Surrey rise 42%
EAST SURREY Holdings, the small water supply company based in Redhill, has
announced a 42 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, helped by price
increases and a lower interest charge.
But the company has warned that a hosepipe and sprinkler ban in force since
March may have to be extended if rain levels are low in the autumn.
'Our bore holes are now at the levels we normally expect for the end rather
than beginning of summer,' said Mr Ian Foster, managing director.
East Surrey lifted profits from Pounds 3.91m to Pounds 5.54m in the year to
March 31.
It heralds the start of the month-long reporting season for the 25 water
supply companies and 10 privatised water services companies in England and
Wales.
Turnover increased 30 per cent to Pounds 21.9m (Pounds 16.9m).
Mr Foster said the steep increases in profits and sales reflected the last
year of East Surrey's high K allowance, the amount of increase allowed above
the rate of inflation.
K was set at 16 per cent last year, following 16.5 per cent in 1991.
This high allowance was designed to bring companies such as East Surrey in
line with the privatised water services companies and prepare for heavy
capital expenditure programmes.
East Surrey's K allowance has been reduced to 2 per cent for this year,
although the company has agreed with Ofwat, the water regulator, that price
rises will not be above inflation.
East Surrey warned that the rate of growth of its water business could now
slow.
Operating costs rose to Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 11.6m).
Most of the increase was due to extra spending on underground mains which
need upgrading. Capital expenditure rose to Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 6.5m).
Interest costs fell to Pounds 982,000 (Pounds 1.34m) following a debenture
repayment.
Earnings increased to 38.7p (26.6p). The company is recommending a final
dividend of 6p (5p) to give a total of 9.56p (8p), an increase of 19.5 per
cent.
East Surrey expanded its non-regulated business with two acquisitions,
including a small water treatment company. But non-regulated turnover
remained at under Pounds 1m, although Mr Foster said growth could be rapid.
The company said unbudgeted expenditure of Pounds 8m may be needed in
1994-95 to meet EC standards on water quality and pesticides. Tests are
under way to assess the final cost of compliance.
