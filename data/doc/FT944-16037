FT  15 OCT 94 / DTI jumped the gun on aid for Jaguar X200 project
Ford, the US carmaker, has not yet applied for state aid to build a new
range of smaller Jaguar sports saloons in the UK, the Department of Trade
and Industry said yesterday.
The department withdrew a statement made last weekend that the government
had already 'made an offer' to Ford and that it was now 'discussing the
details'.
The earlier statement had arisen from an 'internal misunderstanding' between
its officials. It said: 'We have received no formal application, and no
offer has been made. We are aware, however, that the company may be seeking
funds in due course.'
Earlier the government was forced to provide about Pounds 9.5m in selective
regional aid to persuade Ford to build the successor to the Jaguar XJS
sportscar in Coventry rather than in Portugal.
Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and chief executive, said last week that the
Pounds 9.5m grant for the XJS replacement project 'would pale by comparison'
with the aid needed to ensure that the sports saloon, codenamed X200, is
built in the UK.
The company is studying the alternatives of building the new car range
either at Jaguar's Coventry plant or at one of its US plants in Michigan.
Ford has for the past couple of years been preparing a project to build a
range of smaller Jaguar sports saloons. A formal decision is not expected
until next year.
The Jaguar is expected to be developed from the same chassis platform as a
new range of luxury cars to be sold under Ford's Lincoln/Mercury brandnames.
The new car would be an addition to the Jaguar range and would more than
double output to more than 100,000 a year by 1998-99. The car is planned for
launch in 1998.
Jaguar was yesterday reported as offering workers a two-year pay deal worth
up to 8 per cent affecting up to 4,500 hourly paid workers. The deal comes a
week after Rover agreed two-year deals worth an average 10.7 per cent for
its workers.
