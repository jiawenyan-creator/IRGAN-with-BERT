FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help boost BPP to Pounds 7m
A DROP in spending on language training by large international companies
restricted growth in 1992 at BPP Holdings, the education and training group.
However, pre-tax profits still increased from Pounds 6.39m to Pounds 7.08m
thanks to a full-year contribution from acquisitions during 1991. Sales rose
from Pounds 42.4m to Pounds 48.7m.
Linguarama, the language training subsidiary, encountered increasingly
difficult trading conditions. An exceptional charge of Pounds 650,000
covered redundancies and the closure of language schools in Japan and
France.
Mr Richard Price, chairman, said this reorganisation would result in a more
competitive business comprising 34 schools in 10 countries, although trading
was likely to remain difficult in Japan and continental Europe.
Operating profits from language training were Pounds 857,000 (Pounds 1.16m)
on turnover of Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 18.3m). A breakdown of profits and
turnover showed publishing at Pounds 3.29m (Pounds 1.95m) on Pounds 14.3m
(Pounds 9.53m), professional training at Pounds 2.47m (Pounds 1.88m) on
Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 10.1m) and academic education at Pounds 306,000 (Pounds
484,000) on Pounds 4.36m (Pounds 4.42m).
Net cash at the year-end was Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 6.7m). In spite of
considering a number of candidates, BPP made no acquisitions in 1992.
Earnings per share fell from 17.3p to 16p, thanks mainly to an increased tax
charge of Pounds 2.67m (Pounds 2.09m). The group said that given the
cash-generative quality of the business, it had decided to increase the
final dividend to 5.3p, giving a total for the year of 8p (6.9p).
