FT  05 JUL 93 / Observer: Precious time
As is shown by numerous courses for executives on how to manage their day
efficiently, time is a valuable resource. It can also have costly
implications, as deposed minister Michael Mates now knows all too well.
But in looking back on the watch that started the countdown to his
resignation, he can at least have the consolation of knowing it could have
cost him even more. Take the latest Grande Complication timepiece from Swiss
manufacturers Blancpain.
Platinum-cased, the watch's mechanical workings include 780 moving parts,
all hand-made, and took four years to perfect. Its six functions include a
perpetual calendar, a chronograph with a split second, a minute repeater,
and moon phase. Only 30 are to be produced at the rate of five a year. And
the price?
SF800,000 apiece although, on Friday night's exchange rates at any rate,
Pounds 351,650 or so would do.
