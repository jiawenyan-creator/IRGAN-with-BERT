VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS; 
CORONER SAYS MAN COMMITTED SUICIDE 
The Ventura County coroner's office said Wednesday that a Thousand Oaks man 
found dead in a truck at the bottom of a ravine in Ventura had committed 
suicide. 
The man, Joseph Portao, 71, was reported missing by his wife five weeks ago. 
The body was found Monday after nearby residents spotted the truck. 
Portao had deliberately driven the truck off of a little-used road at the top 
of Kalorama Street and plunged 400 feet to his death, Deputy Coroner James 
Wingate said. 
Portao died from chest injuries and had been dead for about three weeks, 
Wingate said. CAROL WATSON
