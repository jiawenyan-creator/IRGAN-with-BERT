payments (LDP) made by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) in accordance with The Agricultural Act of 1949 (the
1949 Act), as amended. The amendments made by this interim rule will provide: greater clarity; enhance the administration
of CCC programs by providing uniformity between CCC price support programs; eliminate obsolete provisions; provide
more authority to State and county committees in administering the programs; lessen administrative actions CCC
imposes on producers who violate the loan and LDP agreements; and correct errors.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Executive Order 12866 


This rule has been determined to be not-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been
reviewed by OMB. 


Federal Assistance Program 


The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to
which this rule applies are: Commodity Loans and Purchases_10.051. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable because CCC is not required by 5 U.S.C.
553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the subject matter of these
determinations. 


Environmental Evaluation 


It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will not have a significant impact on the quality
of human environment. 


Executive Order 12372 


This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24,
1983). 


Executive Order 12778 


This rule has been reviewed pursuant to Executive Order 12778. To the extent State and local laws are in conflict with
these regulatory provisions, it is the intent of CCC that the terms of the regulations prevail. The provisions of this
rule are not retroactive. Prior to any judicial action in a court of jurisdiction, administrative review under 7 CFR
part 780 must be exhausted. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


Public reporting burden for the information collections contained in this regulation with respect to price support
programs is estimated to average 15 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching
existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of
information. The information collections have previously been cleared under the current regulations by OMB, and
assigned OMB Nos. 05600087 and 05600129. The content and format of the information collections have
not changed as a result of this amendment to 7 CFR part 1427; however, the frequency of reporting has been reduced. ASCS
will submit a burden correction worksheet to OMB for review. 


Comments 


Since producers are currently making decisions regarding upland and extra long staple cotton which may be pledged
as collateral for CCC price support loans, it has been determined that it is impractical and contrary to the public
interest for CCC to engage in proposed rulemaking requirements with respect to the provisions of this rule. Accordingly,
the provisions of this interim rule are effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register

. Comments are requested, however, and will be taken into consideration when developing the final rule. This interim
rule will be scheduled for review so that a final document discussing comments received and any amendments required
can be published in the 

Federal Register

 as soon as possible. 


Background 


The 1949 Act sets forth the statutory authority for CCC price support programs. CCC price support programs are intended
to stabilize market prices and provide interim financing and assistance to producers in the orderly marketing of
eligible commodities. 
This interim rule amends regulations found at 7 CFR part 1427 to provide rules for administering CCC price support
programs for the 1994 and subsequent crop years.
