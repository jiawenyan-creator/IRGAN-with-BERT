FT  28 APR 92 / UK Company News: Margins improve as S Lyles rises 48%
Improved margins and a cut in interest charges enabled S Lyles, the yarn
spinner and dyer, to increase first half profit by 48 per cent.
Turnover fell to Pounds 8.25m (Pounds 8.57m) reflecting reduced selling
prices resulting from the lower price of wool. But operating profit rose to
Pounds 485,000 (Pounds 389,000) and interest costs were Pounds 17,000
(Pounds 73,000) to leave the pre-tax balance at Pounds 468,000 (Pounds
316,000) for the six months to December 31.
Earnings per share rose to 4.47p (2.64p) and the interim dividend is lifted
