YOUTH ARRESTED IN STABBING DEATH 
A 17-year-old suspected gang member was arrested Friday on suspicion of 
stabbing to death another 17-year-old who was helping his mother expel unwanted 
guests from a party. 
Police believe the suspect, whose name was not released because of his age, 
stabbed Edward Navarrette on Sept. 22 in retaliation for a gang-related 
incident. 
According to police, Navarrette did not belong to a gang but did associate with 
known gang members, who apparently were the targets of retaliation. 
On the night of his death, Navarrette had been trying to help his mother eject 
a group of people who had crashed his party at the Navarrette house on the 3900 
block of San Mateo Avenue. 
"A large fight broke out between invited guests and the intruders after 
belligerent remarks were made to (Navarrette's) mother," Los Alamitos Police 
Cmdr. Gary Biggerstaff said in a prepared statement.
