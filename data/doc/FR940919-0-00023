List of Items Controlled 



a. Commercial Communication Satellites, except those with the following characteristic: 

a.1. Anti-jam capability: Antennas and/or antenna systems with the ability to respond to incoming interference
by adaptively reducing antenna gain in the direction of the interference; 

a.2. Antennas: 

a.2.a. With aperture (overall dimensions of the radiating portion(s) of the antennas) greater than 30 feet; or 

a.2.b. With all sidelobes less than or equal to ^35db; or 

a.2.c. Designed, modified or configured to provide coverage area on the surface of the earth less than 200 nm in diameter,
where ``coverage area'' is defined as that area on the surface of the earth that is illuminated by the main beam width
of the antenna (which is the angular distance between half power points of the beam); 

a.3. Designed, modified or configured for intersatellite data relay links that do not involve a ground relay terminal
(``cross-links''); 

a.4. Spaceborne baseband processing equipment that uses any technique other than frequency translation which can
be changed on a channel by channel basis among previously assigned fixed frequencies several times a day; 

a.5. Employing any of the cryptographic items controlled under Category XIII(b) of the U.S. Munitions List (USML);


a.6. Employing radiation-hardened devices controlled elsewhere in 121.1 of the ITAR (22 CFR 121.1) that are
not ``embedded'' in the satellite in such a way as to deny physical access. (For purposes of this subparagraph ``embedded''
means that the device cannot feasibly either be removed from the satellite or used for other purposes.); 

a.7. Having propulsion systems that permit acceleration of the satellite on-orbit (i.e. after mission orbit injection)
at rates greater than 0.1 g;
