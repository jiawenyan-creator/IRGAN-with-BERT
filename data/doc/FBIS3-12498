  [Text] A spokesman for the Jordanian-Omani mediation 
committee in charge of ending fighting between the Yemeni Army 
units said yesterday evening that the committee has disengaged 
the warring forces in the southern Governorate of Abyan and 
reached a cease-fire. He added that the committee managed to 
bring the situation in the city of Mudiyah in the Abyan 
Governorate under control and to disengage the two warring 
parties. He indicated that agreement was reached with the 
leaders of the two sides to return the military forces to their 
pre-crisis positions following the signing of the document of 
pledge and accord in Amman on 20 February. 
  The military committee, composed of Yemeni, Jordanian, and 
Omani officers, was formed last Sunday. It enjoys the support 
of Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid. It was tasked to return forces to their previous 
positions away from the past border areas, end clashes, and 
merge the northern and southern armies.
