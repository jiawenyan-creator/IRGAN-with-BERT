FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Debt trading lifts Morgan Grenfell to
Pounds 56m
A MOVE into trading the debt of lesser-developed countries helped pre-tax
profits at Morgan Grenfell, the London-based merchant bank owned by Deutsche
Bank, advance by 21 per cent last year to Pounds 56.5m.
This reversed the bank's profits decline in 1990, leaving it with a return
on capital of about 15 per cent after transfers to general provisions.
The figure was struck before taking account of Morgan Grenfell's
compensation payment to Argyll, the supermarkets group, arising out of its
role in advising Guinness during the battle for control of Distillers in
1986.
The payment, believed to be Pounds 5m, was treated as an exceptional charge.
Morgan's improvement last year was due to a strong performance from its
banking division, with all three areas - treasury, asset trading and project
finance - performing well, said Mr Michael Dobson, group chief executive.
The bank moved into debt trading only at the tail end of 1990, and 1991
represented the first full year's contribution from this activity.
Last year it traded more than Dollars 22bn worth of debt, making it the
fourth most active in the world, the bank said.
The bank's treasury division is also believed to have performed strongly.
Morgan said it had make only small specific provisions to cover bad debts
during the year, although it refused to disclose the size.
It expanded the size of its loan book to take advantage of better lending
margins, said Mr Dobson.
By contrast, Morgan's traditional corporate finance business remained in the
doldrums, while fund management advanced on the back of stronger markets.
