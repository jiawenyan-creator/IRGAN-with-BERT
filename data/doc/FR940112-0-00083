 An individual's monthly income for post-eligibility purposes is $1,820. The monthly Medicaid rate is $1,200 ($40
per day), and the private rate is $1,800 ($60 per day). The monthly spenddown liability is $1,500. The individual is
in the institution as of the first day of the month and the State projects institutional expenses at the Medicaid rate.


Since projected monthly expenses as of the first day of the month at the Medicaid rate ($1,200) are not sufficient to
meet the spenddown liability ($1,500), the individual is not eligible. However, after remaining in the institution
for 15 days the individual has actually incurred expenses of $900 at the private rate ($60 &times; 15 days). The projected
institutional expenses at the Medicaid rate for the remaining days in the month are $600 ($40 &times; 15 days). Thus,
as of the 15th day of the month, the individual is eligible and the rules on post-eligibility treatment of income apply.

The same post-eligibility procedure described in Examples 1 and 2 apply to Example 3. Since the individual has $900
in actually incurred expenses and another $600 in projected expenses, the individual has met the spenddown liability
of $1,500. However, because the individual remains liable for the $1,500 in institutional charges, reimbursable
institutional expenses are reduced to zero. Therefore, no additional steps apply in the post-eligibility process.
The individual would be expected to use $1,500 of his or her $1,820 in income to cover institutional charges, leaving
the individual with $30 earmarked for personal needs and $290 for discretionary use. 

It should be noted that if the individual were to incur additional noninstitutional health care expenses during the
period of Medicaid eligibility, the State, at its option, can have the individual contribute more of his or her discretionary
income toward total health care costs included in the State plan. This can be done by substituting the noninstitutional
expenses (for which the State would otherwise pay) for a corresponding amount of projected institutional costs in
the spenddown calculation. The individual becomes liable for the noninstitutional expenses as part of his or her
spenddown liability and has to contribute remaining discretionary income toward the replaced institutional costs
under the post-eligibility calculation. 

For example, assume that the individual in this example incurs $200 in noninstitutional physical therapy expenses
included in the State plan and the State substitutes those expenses for $200 of the $600 in projected institutional
charges. The individual's spenddown liability of $1,500 is now composed of $900 in actual institutional charges,
$400 in projected institutional charges, and $200 in physical therapy expenses. The otherwise reimbursable institutional
charges of $1,500 are then reduced to $200 to offset the $1,300 in institutional charges that are deductible from income.
Under the post-eligibility procedures, the individual would have $290 that can be contributed toward the cost of
care ($1,820 total income, less $1,500 in unreimbursable health care expenses, less $30 projected for personal needs)
and, thus, would be responsible for the $200 in reimbursable institutional charges. The individual is now responsible
for $1,700 (instead of $1,500) in health care costs ($1,300 in institutional charges used to meet spenddown liability,
$200 in noninstitutional physical therapy expenses used to meet the spenddown liability, and $200 in institutional
charges under the post-eligibility process). This leaves the individual with $90 in discretionary income instead
of $290, with Medicaid paying $200 less.
