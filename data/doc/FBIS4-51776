  [Text] It was learned on 26 April that on 12 April, two 
days before U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry's ROK visit, 
the ROK Ministry of National Defense decided to introduce about 
80 billion won worth of U.S. weapons, including anti-artillery 
radar, into the country from 1995, one or two years ahead of the 
original schedule. 
  According to military officials, the MND has decided to 
hasten the purchase of three sorts of weapons demanded by U.S. 
Forces Korea because a budget for buying them has become 
available since adjustments of the Yulgok Project, such as the 
cancellation of the plan to improve the capacity of Phantom 
F-4s, were made as a result of a special inspection into the 
Yulgok Project in March, and because the ROK-based U.S. forces 
have strongly demanded the reinforcement in equipment of the ROK 
Army in preparation for a war since the beginning of this year. 
  The ROK will hasten the purchase of the following weapons 
from the United States at U.S. Forces Korea's request for an 
early purchase of them with the reason of effective joint 
operations: AN-TPQ 37, an anti-artillery radar for detecting 
the enemy's artillery units (58 billion won worth); C-NITE, 
night shooting control equipment attached to Cobra helicopters 
that enables tow missiles to be fired at night (20 billion won 
worth); and a jamming device that disturbs infrared guided 
missiles (2 billion won worth).
