FT  19 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow shows resilience to
interest rate fears
Wall Street
ANOTHER rise in bond yields, combined with worries about inflation and
interest rate prospects, pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average blue chip
indicator down initially yesterday, but by the close most of the fall had
been recovered, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Average was finally just 5.54 easier at 3,444.39 after a day's low
of 3,422.52. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.05 off at 440.32, while the
Nasdaq composite gained 2.82 at 680.78. Trading volume on the New York SE
was 264.3m shares.
The dominant concern of the markets remained inflation and interest rates.
Since last week's poor consumer and producer prices data, long-term bond
yields have risen from 6.8 per cent to almost 7 per cent.
This rise in yields has unnerved equity investors, who fear that higher
interest rates may be around the corner, primarily because the Federal
Reserve may react to rising inflation by tightening monetary policy. Higher
rates would hinder corporate profitability, and make equities considerably
less attractive relative to other financial assets.
Although this concern kept many share prices in check yesterday, secondary
stocks traded on the electronic Nasdaq market managed to post some solid
gains.
The day's only economic news - a 6.7 per cent increase in April housing
starts - was in line with expectations and had little effect on the market.
A bright feature on the NYSE was Hewlett-Packard, which jumped Dollars 5 to
Dollars 84 5/8 in volume of 3.3m shares after announcing stronger than
expected net income of Dollars 1.38 a share for the fiscal second quarter.
At the same stage a year earlier the company earned Dollars 1.27 a share.
The news from Hewlett-Packard buoyed other computer stocks. Compaq advanced
Dollars 2 to Dollars 55 3/8 , IBM Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 49, Motorola
Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 78 and Digital Equipment Dollars 1 to Dollars 47
1/4 .
The main indices would have been higher but for sizeable losses in selected
big stocks, including Ford, down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 53 1/2 , and
Caterpillar, Dollars 1 cheaper at Dollars 68.
Home Depot was another stock lifted by good earnings news. The retailer rose
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 44 1/8 in volume of 2.6m shares on reporting
first-quarter profits of 24 cents a share, against the 18 cents earned a
year ago.
Cummins Engine dropped Dollars 5 3/8 to Dollars 86 3/4 after brokerage house
Prudential Securities lowered its rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'hold'
following the recent release of disappointing truck orders figures.
Canada
TORONTO advanced in heavy trading, boosted by a renewed surge in gold
shares. The TSE 300 index ended 34.3 stronger at 3,826.8 and rises outpaced
declines by 372 to 318. Volume reached 75.6m shares and the trading value
was CDollars 716.3m.
Ten of the 14 stock group indices ended higher, led by the golds sector,
which jumped 5.75 per cent.
Golds had retreated somewhat over the previous two sessions, following a
six-day winning streak fuelled by sharp increases in the price of the
precious metal. The New York spot gold price yesterday climbed USDollars
7.90 an ounce on a slide in the US bond market.
