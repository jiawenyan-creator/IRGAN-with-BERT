SOVIET CIVIL WAR 
In response to "Yeltsin Sees Discontent but No Soviet Coup," Part I, Sept. 11: 
Lately, I have been reading that, because of the general economic 
dissatisfaction in the Soviet Union, there is a possibility of a civil war. The 
recently visiting (Communist Party populist) Boris Yeltsin tackled this rumor 
by indicating that the war scare was simply a "scarecrow" created for the 
purpose of frightening the republics' citizens concerned about "growing" 
nationalism. 
It is difficult to conceive of a "civil" war in the Soviet Union. Unlike the 
United States, the individual republics are not analogous to our individual 
states. The only way one can have a civil war is within each individual 
republic. Westerners cannot seem to grasp that the term "Soviet Union" simply 
indicates the political manner in which these 15 republics, along with Russia, 
are held. The word "soviet" means council. According to the constitution, every 
republic is a separate entity with representatives to the supreme council. 
Has anyone else noticed that, every time the Russian-dominated empire loosens 
its grip on the rest of the republics, the first thing we notice is that 
nationalism raises its head? What does that tell us?
