FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bobst sales fall 10 per cent
BOBST, the Swiss packaging machinery group, said its sales last year fell
10.2 per cent to SFr1.01bn (Dollars 674m), reflecting an accelerated
slowdown in the last months of 1992, especially in Europe, writes Ian Rodger
in Zurich.
The group expected cash-flow and profit figures for the year to be lower,
but to a lesser degree than turnover thanks to cost-cutting programmes.
