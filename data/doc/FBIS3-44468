  [Text] Beijing, December 31 (CNS) -- This year has seen 
the biggest ever investment in railway construction and the 
greatest length of new railways in China's history, according to 
the Ministry of Railways. 
  By the end of November, 53 medium- and large-scale rail 
construction projects saw investment of RMB [renminbi] 16.06 
billion, three times as much as for the same period last year. 
Work done for these projects included 150 million cubic metres 
of road-bed, 88,000 metres of tunnels, 160,000 metres of medium- 
and large-scale bridges and some 1,655.2 kilometres of 
track-laying. 
  The initial stage of the Beijing-Kowloon railway has 
proceeded smoothly with 1,360 kilometres of the roadbed being 
laid by the end of November, 84 percent of the total length 
while 532 kilometres of track, one-third the total length, has 
been laid. 
  The second-phase project of the Daqin railway and the 
double- 
track project of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway have passed 
inspection while electrification of the Zhangxia section of the 
Yingtan-Xiamen railway has also been completed.
