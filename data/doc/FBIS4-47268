  [Abstract] The organization and methodology of 
certification of production of individual means of protection 
(SIZ) are basically the same as for any other type of 
production. Monitoring production for the purpose of 
certification is carried out in accordance with a working 
methodology worked out by organs for the certification of 
production as applied to specific production of a SIZ. The 
methodology specifies the sequence and extent of checking of 
finished production, technological systems, maintenance and 
repair systems, and systems for control and testing. In the 
production of SIZ there are certain special features pertaining 
to the above first and second points. In checking and evaluating 
finished production special attention is devoted to 
registration, analysis and prophylaxis of defects outlined in 
the classifier which an enterprise presents together with other 
initial data needed for certification. In checking and 
evaluating technological systems, special attention is devoted 
to checking special and especially critical technological 
processes (TP). The main TP being checked (operations) on the 
fabrication of parts and assembly units of a production being 
claimed are stated in the methodology and must be stated in the 
list of critical defects outlined in the classifier. The defect 
classifier and list of checked TP (operations) for SIZ for 
respiratory organs are presented as an example.
