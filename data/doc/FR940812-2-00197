 Notice of inquiry.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Postal Service requests comments on the issuance of a haze value guideline for glassine envelope window-covering
material. This guideline would be advisory only; it would not affect the existing Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards
concerning mail prepared with glassine windows.

<DATE>
DATES:

 Comments must be received on or before October 5, 1994.

ADDRESS:

 Written comments should be mailed or delivered to the Manager, Business Mail Acceptance, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Room
8430, Washington, DC 20260-6808. Copies of all written comments will be available for inspection and photocopying
between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, in Room 8430 at the above address.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Postal Service automation-compatibility standards for envelope window-covering material focus on a measurement
that combines the window material's transparency and the print quality of the address or barcode that appears behind
it. Measuring the transparency and the print quality in concert provides the most relevant data to determine whether
Postal Service automated sorting equipment will be capable of successfully reading the address and/or barcode during
processing. Thus, Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards for letter-size mail in automation-rate mailings require
that addresses viewed through a glassine window covering must provide a print contrast ratio (PCR) of at least 45 percent
and that barcodes viewed through the material must provide a print reflectance difference (PRD) of at least 30 percent.
(These percentages pertain to both the red and the green portions of the optical spectrum, when measured using a USPS
or USPS-licensed envelope reflectance meter.) 


Although these readability standards identify useful performance criteria for window-covering material, some
glassine manufacturers have complained that it is difficult to translate them into production criteria for their
products. It is impractical for glassine manufacturers to know, in advance of production, the quality of the printing
that will show through the window of an envelope using their product, yet this information becomes critical in determining
whether the material meets USPS automation-compatibility specification. 
Accordingly, to help glassine manufacturers establish appropriate criteria for the glassine itself in isolation
from the printing that will be used with it, the Postal Service conducted a series of laboratory and operational tests
on a variety of materials. 
The laboratory test method used was the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) D 1003, Standard Test Method
for Haze and Luminous Transmittance of Transparent Plastics. Test measurements were taken with a MacBeth Color-Eye
7000 Spectrophotometer and Optiview software set for correlated haze. Environmental conditions, material thickness,
dimensional stability, gloss, and haze were carefully measured and monitored during testing on both the Postal Service
multiline optical character reader (MLOCR) version A and the wide area barcode reader (WABCR). (A detailed description
of testing methods and criteria is available on request.) 
As a result of these tests, the Postal Service proposes that glassine window-covering material be evaluated for automation
compatibility by measuring its haze value. Correlated (transmitted) haze is defined as the percentage of transmitted
light that deviates from the incident beam by forward scattering when passing through a specimen. Any specimen with
a haze value greater than 30 percent, when tested in accordance with ASTM D 1003 is considered diffusing or translucent.
This can affect readability on the OCR or WABCR by diffusing the image of the printed insert as read through the window-covering
material.
