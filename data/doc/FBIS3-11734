  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari issued an order 
stating that the national flag will fly at half mast on Friday 
[25 March] as a sign of national mourning. This means that the 
national mourning, which had been established for Thursday, will 
continue tomorrow. The order states that the measure is in 
keeping with the deep indignation and rejection with which 
Mexican society has rejected the assassination of Luis Donaldo 
Colosio, presidential candidate for the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party. 
  The order will be published in DIARIO OFFICIAL on Friday. 
The decision to prolong the national mourning until tomorrow, 
however, does not imply the suspension of labor duties. 
  The Finance and Public Credit Secretariat announced that all 
financial operations will resume tomorrow. This is important 
information bearing in mind that the national mourning will 
continue tomorrow. Financial sector operations will resume 
tomorrow. Banks and the Mexican Stock Exchange will resume 
their normal activities, according to the Mexican Bank 
Association.
