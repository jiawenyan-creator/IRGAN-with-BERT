RELIGIOUS BLACKMAIL 
Soon our country will be celebrating the anniversary of the signing of the Bill 
of Rights of our Constitution. 
The Catholic bishops are a forceful political lobby with a tremendous economic 
base, thus violating the constitutional separation of church and state. Should 
they be tax exempt if they continue to participate in political action? 
Political candidates are representatives of their constituents and should vote 
accordingly. Otherwise, those of us who do pay taxes are taxed without 
representation. 
Thank you, Lucy Killea, for your firm stand against tyranny. You have our 
votes!
