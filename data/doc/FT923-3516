FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Brit Mohair slips to Pounds 1m at halfway
PRE-TAX profits of British Mohair declined from Pounds 1.18m to Pounds 1.02m
over the half year ended June 30.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 18.5m) with exports accounting for
Pounds 5.02m (Pounds 4.59m). Textiles continued to operate at reduced levels
and profit margins were eroded. However, the engineering subsidiaries and
other activities increased both turnover and profits.
Trading conditions in textiles were expected to remain difficult in the
second half. But the directors said the improvement in profits from
specialised engineering should be maintained and they expected group profits
for the second six months to be similar to those of the first half.
