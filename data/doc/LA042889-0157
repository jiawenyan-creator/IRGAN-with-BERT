ARSON SUSPECTED IN ISRAELI FOREST FIRE 
Fire damaged Jerusalem's Kennedy memorial forest during the night, and Israeli 
officials said Thursday that they suspect arson. 
It took firefighters 12 hours to control fires that started about 8 p.m. 
Wednesday. Moshe Rivlin, chairman of the Jewish National Fund, which is in 
charge of Israeli forestry, said flames destroyed eight acres and about 3,000 
trees. The forest, several hundred acres of pine, is named for the late 
President John F. Kennedy.
