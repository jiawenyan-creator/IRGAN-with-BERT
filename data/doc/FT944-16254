FT  14 OCT 94 / Recycling scheme backed by environment secretary
Retail stores and other companies were warned yesterday that opting out of a
scheme for recycling packaging would not secure them any commercial
advantage, Ivor Owen writes.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, told the Conservative conference that
legislation would underpin arrangements agreed by the packaging and retail
industries. When Mr Gummer and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, accepted the need for legislation they insisted that its main
purpose should be to facilitate the role of market forces. He praised the
packaging and retailing industries for a scheme which was expected to
increase to nearly 60 per cent - double the existing level - the amount of
material recycled.
Mr Gummer said legislation to establish the environment agency, published in
draft form yesterday, provided for a leaner regulatory body. It would bring
together the pollution inspectorate, the National Rivers Authority and the
waste regulators, and end overlapping jurisdiction, competing regulations
and unnecessary repetitive inspections.
Mr Gummer said improved protection for the 'green belt' around large cities
and towns would be 'balanced'. The environment would be enhanced if existing
buildings on sites in green belts were improved instead of being left to
decline and decay.
