FT  17 NOV 93 / Engineering throughput is reduced
ENGINEERING companies in South Yorkshire and the north Midlands are working
at an average of only 72 per cent capacity, an informal survey for the
Department of Trade and Industry shows.
The Sheffield Association of the Engineering Employers' Federation, which
covers the area, was asked by the DTI to help assess what was happening
among manufacturers.
Nearly half of the 71 members who responded reported they had reduced
capacity during the recession, mainly by stopping night shifts and
downsizing factories. Although 11 per cent said they were at full capacity,
the rest ranged from 25 per cent to 93 per cent, with 72 per cent the
average.
Lack of demand was the main reason given for plant not being used.
Mr Nicholas Kemp, director of the Sheffield Association, said yesterday:
'There is so much spare capacity that even if there is a significant
pick-up, at least 60 per cent have more than enough to cope.'
Mr Kemp said that some companies had already invested in more efficient
equipment, which was a priority for future competitiveness.
