  [Text] President Boris Yeltsin has returned to Moscow from 
Sochi after a two-week vacation. 
  At Sochi airport he said that he had had a good holiday. 
Asked by our correspondent about his immediate working plans, 
the president replied: 
  [Begin Yeltsin recording] What is waiting in Moscow? Well, 
first we need to complete the mechanism for implementing the 
presidential message to the Federal Assembly. I have been 
working on this here and a group has also been at work on it in 
Moscow. We will now amalgamate our work somehow and we will 
accordingly, so to speak, and in conjunction with the Federal 
Assembly, discuss this implementation mechanism. 
  Second, there is the agreement on civil accord. I attach 
very great importance to this and have been engaged on this 
matter here as well. We also agreed that a working group would 
work on it in Moscow, and work has continued over the past two 
weeks. It also, so to speak, has its own material. 
  Of course, we would like, I personally would like us to sign 
this agreement -- all parties, public associations and groups, 
factions, power bodies -- I mean, the Federation Council and the 
State Duma, the government, and the president. 
  I think this would create a more favorable and calm 
situation 
in the whole of Russia, and not only in Russia. [end recording]
