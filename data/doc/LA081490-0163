APPLE SALES IN APPLE PIE ORDER 
People ate more apples last year than ever despite bad publicity about 
chemicals used by growers and a slight decline in overall consumption of fresh 
fruit, Agriculture Department figures showed today. 
The department's Economic Research Service said that a large apple crop and low 
prices combined to push per capita consumption to 21.6 pounds in 1989 from 
19.87 pounds in 1988. 
"Bananas and apples continued to be the two most popular fresh fruits in the 
United States," the service said. 
Overall, fresh fruit consumption dropped 2% last year to an average of 96.6 
pounds per person. 
Apple growers feared the worst in March, 1989, when the Natural Resources 
Defense Council said that apples treated with Alar increased the risk of cancer 
in children.
