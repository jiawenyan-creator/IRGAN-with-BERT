  [Excerpts] Croat refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
majority of them from central Bosnia, organized a peaceful 
demonstration outside the Bosnia-Herzegovina Embassy in Zagreb 
today to protest at Muslim aggression against the Croatian 
population in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Reporter] You are a jihad embassy, the killers of Algeria 
are the same as those in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Vukovar equals 
Vitez -- these were some of the slogans which could be seen 
outside the embassy during a protest demonstration by about 100 
people. The police blocked their way about 30 meters from the 
embassy. [passage omitted] 
  Behind the tightly closed Bosnia-Herzegovina Embassy doors, 
the staff, well guarded by the police, show no signs of 
nervousness. Neven Kulenovic, an adviser in the embassy, 
commented that it is no coincidence that the demonstrations are 
taking place at a time when Jadranko Prlic is asking the 
Croatian Government to sever diplomatic relations with 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. [passage omitted]
