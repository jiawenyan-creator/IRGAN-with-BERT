FT  25 OCT 93 / End to EC legislation monopoly urged
THE European Commission's monopoly right to initiate Community legislation
should be removed under a new power-sharing arrangement among EC
institutions, according to a report published today by the London-based
European Policy Forum.
The report suggests that the European Council of ministers and the European
parliament should also have the right to initiate EC action or legislation.
But it rules out downgrading the Commission to a secretariat of the Council
or the new European Union created by the Maastricht treaty.
The report was written by Sir Michael Jenkins, a former senior UK Foreign
Office official who served as ambassador to the Netherlands and deputy
secretary general of the European Commission.
Sir Michael's other recommendations are that:
The rotating presidency of the EC should be extended from six months to a
year, to provide greater continuity, and be held by a larger and a smaller
state in partnership.
The European Parliament should be strengthened with a second chamber of
members nominated from national parliaments.
A second chamber of the European Court should be created to deal with
matters of Community competence.
The report is intended as a contribution to the post-Maastricht debate on
how the EC should evolve as it seeks to deepen integration while also taking
in new members.
