FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Blockbuster's Cityvision offer meets
opposition
SHAREHOLDERS in Cityvision, the video hire chain, have been approached by a
former executive who is urging a plan intended to provide an alternative to
the Pounds 75m agreed offer from Blockbuster, the US-based video hire chain.
Mr Ray Hipkin, a founder of Cityvision's Ritz chain, and Mr Philip Crane, a
former video shop entrepreneur who sold out to Cityvision, met with several
institutional shareholders last week to outline a new management and
marketing strategy.
The two are said to be critical of the current management, arguing that it
had failed to capitalise sufficiently on the Ritz brand name.
Last month, the management agreed to a cash and shares deal from Blockbuster
valuing the company's shares at 48p, well above the prevailing price.
However, some shareholders were unhappy with the bid, believing Blockbuster
would be acquiring the chain at its trough.
Mr Hipkin and Mr Crane are said to have presented shareholders with a
marketing strategy, similar to that used in Scandinavia, which would
encourage film studios to spend more to promote films on video. A detailed
letter is expected to be sent to shareholders later this week outlining the
proposals.
Shares in Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation have been listed on the
Stock Exchange. The company sought the listing in connection with its
proposed acquisition.
