FT  14 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Diesel engine maker forms China link
Perkins Group, the UK-based diesel engine producer, yesterday announced a
long-term partnership agreement which will see its engines produced in China
for the first time.
The UK company, part of Varity of the US, has signed a technology transfer
contract under which two of its engine families will enter volume production
at Tianjin Engine Works in eastern China.
Perkins sees the agreement as a big breakthrough in China, the world's
fastest-growing diesel engine market. The 10-year agreement with Tianjin,
one of China's leading diesel engine manufacturers, is expected to lead to a
joint venture deal.
Mr Tony Gilroy, chief executive of Perkins, said the agreement was 'a very
important step in developing our presence in China and is part of our
increasing focus on south and east Asia'.
A 'vast potential' existed for Perkins engines throughout China, and the
company was committed to becoming the leading independent manufacturer of
diesel engines in China in partnership with Tianjin, he added.
The contract covers Perkins' Phaser automotive engines and its 1000 Series
industrial range. The first units will be assembled and tested in Tianjin
early next year and annual production could reach 120,000 engines by 2000.
Mr Miao Jianxin, a director of Tianjin, said the agreement with Perkins
provided China with a framework to develop its diesel engine industry at a
vital stage in its economic progress. 'It will offer customers a new range
of high-technology products, and boost the local economy.'
The agreement with Tianjin Engine brings to 12 the number of countries where
Perkins diesel engines are built. Perkins already has close links with India
and Indonesia. Tianjin Engine employs 7,000 people in Tianjin, China's third
largest city.
