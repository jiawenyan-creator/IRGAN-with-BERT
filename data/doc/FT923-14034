FT  09 JUL 92 / Brittan launches probeinto funding for Ilva
SIR Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, yesterday launched a formal
inquiry into L650bn (Dollars 572.6m) state aid to Ilva, Italy's state steel
company, claiming he was helping Italy rein in spending.
But the new government in Rome had sought more time from Brussels to revise
its stock market flotation plan for the company, after it had declared a
loss for 1991.
Sir Leon refused to comment on the latest proposals received on Ilva. But he
said it was clear that, with the flotation gone awry, the company would need
other sources of private finance and the prospect of viability to justify
the L650bn as a normal investment, and not state aid.
'This opening of an inquiry should not in any way be regarded as a hostile
act towards the new government,' Sir Leon said.
The Commission could take several months to rule on the plan. It has the
power to scuttle the whole project and said it wanted to check whether the
injection of funds amounted to state aid or subsidy which might affect rival
steel companies in the Community.
The inquiry might be seen in the US as evidence that the Italian company is
subsidising exports there. The US steel industry has accused counterparts in
the EC of dumping on American markets.
The Commission came in for sharp criticism from the British government last
week when it closed a year-long inquiry and approved a funding package of
more than Dollars 1bn for Cie des Machines Bull, the French computer group.
