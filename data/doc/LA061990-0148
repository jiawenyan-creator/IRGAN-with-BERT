WORLD; 
ARAB POET UNDER HOUSE ARREST 
A judge said poems by an Israeli Arab incited violence and today placed him 
under house arrest. It was one of the strongest steps against an Arab citizen 
during the 30-month-old Palestinian uprising. 
Israel radio said the judge also ordered that any poetry by Shafik Habib be 
submitted to the military censor before publication. 
Habib, a 49-year-old accountant, said in a telephone interview that police were 
"trying to set a precedent. We are in a democratic country. There should be 
freedom of expression." 
He called the action "a very serious move against an Arab intellectual." 
An Arab legislator demanded a parliamentary debate on the action against the 
poet. "This regime is very weak if they are afraid of words," legislator Abdul 
Wahab Darousha said. 
Jamal Kawwar, chairman of the Palestinian Israeli Writers' Union, said Habib is 
the first Israeli Arab citizen to be arrested for his writings.
