FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: BellSouth plans Dollars 9bn
updating of network
BELLSOUTH, the largest of the Baby Bell regional telephone companies that
was spun off from AT&amp;T in 1984, yesterday unveiled plans to spend up to
Dollars 9bn during the next three years updating its telecommunications
network.
The Atlanta-based company said Dollars 5.7bn would be spent to keep up with
the business' growth and to replace outdated equipment, and another Dollars
3bn would be invested in newer technology for the network infrastructure.
Some of the money will go towards the installation of more fibre optic cable
and the continued replacement of analog central offices with digital
equipment.
So far, BellSouth has installed 900,000 miles of fibre optic cable in its US
network and plans to install fibre-to-the-curb systems for 130,000
residential and business customers over the next three years.
The incorporation of self-healing capabilities into the network to enhance
reliability will also continue under the capital investment programme.
In a separate development, BellSouth said it has signed preliminary
agreements with Intel, RAM Mobile Data and Ericsson Telephone to develop new
products and services for the mobile computing market.
The four companies said they planned to expand the availability and increase
the usage of standard Intel processor-based mobile computers able to perform
two-way wireless communications via the nationwide dedicated public mobile
data networks run by RAM.
