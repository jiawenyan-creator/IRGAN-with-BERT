FT  30 DEC 94 / N-fuel plant loses second German deal
British Nuclear Fuels has received another setback with the decision by a
second German nuclear power station not to send spent fuel to the Thorp
reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria. Further cancellations may be on
the way.
RWE and Bayernwerk, the companies operating the 2,600MW Gundremmingen
nuclear power station in Bavaria, wrote to BNF last week informing it of
their intention to end the present contract and use domestic storage
facilities instead. BNF learned just before Christmas that the Krummel power
station in northern Germany was cancelling a contract with Thorp under
pressure from the nuclear lobby.
Because of changes this year to Germany's nuclear legislation, permanent
storage is now possible in Germany. This is much cheaper than the
controversial reprocessing method which produces plutonium. A storage
facility is being built at Gorleben in Lower Saxony.
Until the new site is completed, spent fuel from Gundremmingen, located on
the river Danube, will be stored at Ahaus in the state of North
Rhine-Westphalia (where RWE is based) and at interim facilities in Gorleben.
No details were available about the size or duration of Gundremmingen's
contract with Thorp.
Bayernwerk said the companies were ending the Thorp contract before December
31 to save on cancellation penalties. Other German utilities may cancel
before this weekend for the same reason.
The lost contract relates to the second 10 years of Thorp operation, from
2004 to 2014. BNF had offered German utilities cancellation clauses after
the law change.
BNF had no comment on the cancellation last night. However, the company had
estimated that it might lose 20 per cent of Thorp's orders in the second 10
years. That would not affect the plant's viability, as it was based on
revenues over 10 years.
The cancellation will hearten environmentalists who oppose Thorp's
construction and sought to have it cancelled last year.
