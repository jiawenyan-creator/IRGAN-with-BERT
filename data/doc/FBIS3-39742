  [Text] Paris, Feb 22 (AFP) -- French Defence Minister 
Francois Leotard on Tuesday [22 February] told senators France 
would send 10 to 20 Sagaie tanks to Sarajevo in the next few 
days to boost existing materiel for United Nations troops. 
  The chairman of the Senate Defence and Foreign Affairs 
Committee, Xavier de Villepin, told AFP Leotard had noted that 
UN troops were lightly armed and confirmed that Sagaie tanks 
would be sent in the near future. 
  The tanks, which are equipped with 90-mm guns, will be 
shipped to former Yugoslavia from the southern port of Toulon, 
he said. 
  He emphasised that the tanks were to reinforce materiel for 
troops already on the ground and would not be operated by the 
troop reinforcements France has pledged. 
  French UN troops in Bosnia are already equipped with this 
type of tank, which is the heaviest weapon in their armoury.
