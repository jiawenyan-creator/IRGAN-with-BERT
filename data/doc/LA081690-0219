BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: OCC INSTRUCTOR TEACHES 2,000 YEARS OF IRISH LITERATURE 
Orange Coast College English instructor Tom O'Keeffe was born in Ireland, he 
spends his summers in Ireland and -- guess what? -- each fall he teaches a 
class that explores 2,000 years of Irish literature. 
The class, listed as English 171 in the OCC schedule, will meet from 7 to 10 
p.m. once a week beginning Monday. 
"This is a survey course that covers everything from deep-space myth to airmail 
editions of the Irish Times," says O'Keefe, himself a short story writer and 
essayist, who gives special attention to modern masters such as Joyce and 
Yeats. "I use a variety of texts, even a pamphlet distributed to Irish farmers 
to tell them where not to go with their plows." 
The OCC Admissions office is open Monday through Thursday from 8 a.m. to 7 
p.m., and Fridays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. For registration information, call 
(714) 432-5772.
