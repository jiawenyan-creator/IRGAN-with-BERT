<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) which concern the control
of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from surface coasting of metal parts and products.



The intended effect of proposing approval of these rules is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements
of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)
will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated each of these rules and is proposing
to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary
ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Background 



On March 3, 1778, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended
in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended act), that included the following eight air pollution control districts (APCDs):
Fresno County APCD, Kern County APCD,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Kings County APCD, Madera County APCD, Merced County APCD, San Joaquin County APCD, Stanislaus County APCD, and Tulare
County APCD. 43 FR 8964, 40 CFR 81.305. Because some of these areas were unable to meet the statutory attainment date
of December 31, 1982, California requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment
date to December 31, 1987.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended Act,
that the above districts' portions of the California SIP were inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard
and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 74017671q.
In amend section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas
fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of
May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies. 



<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
At that time, Kern County included portions of two air basins: the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin and the Southeast Desert
Air Basin. The San Joaquin Valley Air Basin portion of Kern County was designated as nonattainment, and the Southeast
Desert air Basin portion of Kern County was designated as unclassified. See 40 CFR 81.305 (1991).




</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
This extension was not requested for the following counties: Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced and Tulare. Thus, the attainment
date for these counties remained December 31, 1982.


</FOOTNOTE>


On March 20, 1991, the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVUAPCD) was formed. The SJVUAPCD
has authority over the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin which includes all of the above eight counties except for the Southeast
Desert Air Basin portion of Kern County. Thus, Country Air Pollution Control District (KCAPCD) still exists, but
only has authority over the Southeast Desert Air Basin portion of Kern County. 


Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified
as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended
section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amended guidance.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. APCDs
found in the San Joaquin Valley Basin (now collectively known as the SJVUAPCD) are classified as serious;
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 therefore, these areas were subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline. KCAPCD was subject
to EPA's SIP-Call, but was not subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
Among other things, the pre-amended guidance consists of those portions of the proposed Post-1987 ozone and carbon
monoxide policy that concern RACT, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987); ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints,
Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987 

Federal Register

 Notice'' (Blue Book) (notice of availability was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 25, 1988); and the existing control technique guidelines (CTGs). 


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
The San Joaquin Valley Air basin retained its designation and was classified by operation of law pursuant to section
107(d) and section 181(a) upon the date of enactment of the CAA. See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991).




</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
KCAPCD was not subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline because the Southeast Desert Air
Basin portion of Kern County was not a pre-enactment nonattainment area, and thus, was not automatically designated
nonattainment on the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. (See sections 107(d) and 182(a)(2)(A)
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.) However, the KCAPCD is still subject to the requirements of EPA's SIP-Call
because the SIP-Call included 

all 

of Kern County. the substantive requirements of the SIP-Call are the same as those of the statutory RACT fix-up requirement.


</FOOTNOTE>


The State of California submitted many revised RACT rules for incorporation into its SIP on May 30, 1991, including
the rules being acted on in this document. This document addresses EPA's proposed action for SJVUAPCD Rule 4603, Surface
Coating of Metal parts and Products and KCAPCD Rule 410.4, Surface Coating of Metal Parts and Products. SJVUAPCD adopted
Rule 4603 on May 20, 1993 and KCAPCD adopted Rule 410.4 on July 12, 1993. These submitted rules were found to be complete
on December 23, 1993 pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51 appendix V
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 and are being proposed for approval into the SIP. 



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
EPA adopted completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(K)(1)(A) of the CAA
revised the criteria on August 26, 1991 (See 56 FR 42216). 
</FOOTNOTE>


Both rules control the emission of VOCs from the surface coating of metal parts and products. VOCs contribute to the
production of ground level ozone and smog. The rules were adopted as part of each district's efforts to achieve the
National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(20(A)
CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these two rules.
