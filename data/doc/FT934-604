FT  23 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Late strength in bonds sends
Dow forward
Wall Street
US blue chip stocks rallied yesterday afternoon in response to an unexpected
surge in the price of longer-dated US Treasury bonds, writes Frank McGurty
in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 17.04 ahead at 3,762.19,
while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved forward 2.02 to
467.32. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 2.06 higher
at 462.83 and the Nasdaq composite up 0.44 at 756.07.
New York SE volume came to 272.4m shares and advancing issues outnumbered
declines by 1,150 to 949.
The day's only fresh economic news was a rather stale morsel for equities.
The Commerce Department said it had revised its estimate of third-quarter
GDP to a seasonally adjusted annual growth rate of 2.9 per cent, up from an
earlier figure of 2.7 per cent.
Equity investors largely ignored the data, as did the US bond market, which
has turned its attentions to the prospects for sustained growth and low
inflation in the first quarter of the new year.
However, bond prices turned sharply higher in the afternoon when the
Treasury's monthly auction of five-year notes generated unexpectedly
aggressive bidding. The demand carried over to the benchmark 30-year issue,
which surged 1 1/4 to 100 7/16 in late trading.
Stocks responded in kind, staging a late rally after being held in a choppy,
directionless pattern during most of the session. The advance was given a
further boost by portfolio managers seeking to dress up their year-end
positions before Christmas.
Among the blue chips, Chevron was up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 87 1/2 , Mobil
Dollars 1 3/4 ahead at Dollars 77 5/8 and General Motors Dollars 3/4 firmer
at Dollars 55 5/8 .
UAL, parent of United Airlines, climbed Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 148 1/2
while its board was meeting to consider an offer by unions to acquire a
majority stake in the company.
Borden shed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 17 1/4 after the food products group
denied reports that it was conducting talks over a possible sale or merger
of the company.
The semiconductor sector was a bright spot, with many issues retracing some
of their recent losses after Prudential Securities raised its rating on
Intel, in part because of an expected industry-wide increase in orders. On
the Nasdaq, Intel rose Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 61 3/4 , while on the NYSE,
Texas Instruments climbed Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 , Motorola Dollars
2 3/4 to Dollars 89 1/8 and National Semiconductor Dollars  5/8 to Dollars
15 1/4 .
With the battle to take over Paramount Communications apparently drawing to
a climax, QVC was marked down Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 41 1/4 after the
directors of the target company voted to accept its sweetened Dollars 10bn
bid. Viacom's 'B' shares, the main currency in its rival offer, were up
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 46 and its 'A' stock Dollars 1 1/8 ahead at Dollars
51. Paramount slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 79 5/8 . Trading in all three
companies was sus-pended for part of the session.

The Toronto market posted a small gain in fairly active trading. The TSE 300
index finished 12.1 firmer at 4,226.8 and rises outscored declines by 426 to
409 after volume of 76.2m shares worth CDollars 790m. Industrial products
rose 1.01 per cent, leading the 11 advancing groups out of the 14 sectors.
