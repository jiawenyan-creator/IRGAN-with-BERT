CONRAD ON ISRAEL 
For years many have thought that Conrad had a particular blind spot when it 
came to Israel and events in the Middle East. Invariably, his cartoons would 
lambaste Israel, demean her leaders, and insensitively exploit the symbol of 
the Jewish people, the Jewish star. 
In many instances, however, it was hard to point with specificity to the 
inaccuracy and shortsightedness of Conrad's imagery. With all of the 
hyper-attention focused on Israel, his added fillips often just blended in. 
But the June 5 Conrad cartoon was, literally, the proof positive of Conrad's 
blind spot. While thousands of unarmed, peaceful protesters were murdered in 
Beijing, while mayhem and carnage continued unabated in Beirut, while the 
Ayatollah died and the, as yet, unratified peace treaty between Iraq and Iran 
threatened to unravel, and while ethnic riots peppered with killings took place 
in Uzbekistan, Conrad chose, once again, to focus on Israel. 
Twice in one week, Conrad's invective and bitter pen misrepresented, 
exaggerated, and maligned the Jewish state (May 28 and June 5). 
The challenges that a Democratic state faces in grappling with the insurrection 
of a hostile and violent element is a formidable one. Israel's record in 
dealing with the intifada is neither beyond criticism nor improvement. 
It does not, however, merit the pictorial invective that Conrad has dished out 
over the past 18 months and, most especially, during the past week. His moral 
outrage ought to be directed at those who merit his acerbic pen.
