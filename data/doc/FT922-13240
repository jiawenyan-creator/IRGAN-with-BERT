FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Four of the new faces around Major's cabinet
table - Michael Portillo: Chief secretary to the Treasury
IF MR John Major's intention was to signal the Tories' determination to
balance the budget over the economic cycle, he has done so with his
appointment of Mr Michael Portillo as chief secretary to the Treasury.
An unashamed member of the rightwing No Turning Back group of MPs, who
welcomed Mrs Margaret Thatcher as the guest of honour at his annual
constituency dinner this year, Mr Portillo is under no illusions that
control of public spending can be relaxed as the economy comes out of
recession.
Colleagues lining up for the annual tussle of the public expenditure round
will find him a formidable opponent.
He can master vast amounts of detail, can argue his case cogently and has a
strong streak of stubbornness or determination. All three qualities were in
evidence as he pushed through both the council tax bill and the local
government bill before parliament was dissolved last month.
He is also committed to low taxation which, even before the election
campaign, he was highlighting as one of the critical differences between the
two main parties.
Aged 38, he is the youngest member of the cabinet, and is already used to
being tipped a future leader of the party.
He became MP for the safe seat of Enfield Southgate at a by-election in
November 1984, having worked as special adviser to Mr Nigel Lawson, the then
chancellor, immediately beforehand.
In 1990 he was given the high-profile job of local government minister. It
made him practically the last public friend of the poll tax before he became
its executioner.
Like Mr Major's, his abilities are praised on all sides of the party. Only
the faintest of unease is occasionally expressed about his ambition. 'I wish
he still invited me to his parties,' was the slightly wistful comment of one
senior Conservative who had known him well when he first worked for the Tory
party.
