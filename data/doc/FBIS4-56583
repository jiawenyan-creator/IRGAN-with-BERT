  [Text] Mexico City, 5 May (EFE) -- Today, a source at the 
Attorney General's Office [PGR] reported that Mexican 
authorities have seized a little more than 400 kg of cocaine 
paste and confiscated an aircraft that flew from Cali, Colombia, 
to the Cancun International Airport. 
  The drugs were discovered in a building at the airport, near 
the aircraft whose range and speed, according to the PGR, make 
it ideal for transporting drugs. For this reason, the plane was 
confiscated and its two crewmen detained. 
  The authorities estimate that, considering price 
fluctuations 
and the quality of the drugs seized, the load would have yielded 
close to 6 million doses and would have had a market value of 
$50 million. The authorities said an investigation has been 
opened to determine the exact origin of the drugs and the 
involved of the plane's crew. 
  The PGR has reported that so far this year approximately 7.5 
metric tons of cocaine have been confiscated in various actions 
throughout the country.
