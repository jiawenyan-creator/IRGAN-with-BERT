FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Curragh chief seeks equity from
Europe
MR Clifford Frame, chairman of Curragh, a big Canadian lead/zinc producer,
is making another attempt to raise new equity in Europe, writes Robert
Gibbens in Montreal.
Curragh, which has been in bankruptcy protection since last April and has
closed its mines in the Yukon and British Columbia because of low metal
prices, faces a showdown with the Bank of Nova Scotia and its unsecured
creditors next Monday.
Mr Frame needs CDollars 50m (USDollars 38m) in new equity, and a CDollars
34m loan guarantee from the Yukon government, to save his restructuring
plan.
Last Friday, an Ontario court gave the bank the right to appoint a receiver
for two Curragh undeveloped properties. Creditors are owed more than
CDollars 200m and the company says it has run out of cash.
Two weeks ago, Korea Zinc and Samsung dropped a plan to buy 50 per cent of
Curragh for CDollars 50m.
Falling metal prices were a factor, but the Koreans wanted other big
investors to put up CDollars 25m.
