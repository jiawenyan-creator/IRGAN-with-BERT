DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OXNARD-SAN FRANCISCO FLIGHTS TO BEGIN AUG. 1 
A commuter airline this week announced plans for service between Oxnard and San 
Francisco. 
Starting Aug. 1, WestAir United Express will offer four nonstop round-trips

The airline, which serves 43 cities in seven states, now flies between Oxnard
