  [Text] The Australian Wheat Board has been forced to drop 
its estimates for Australian standard white and hard wheat 
during the past two months. It has been triggered by subsidy 
pressures from market competitors such as the United States. 
  The board now estimates wheat delivered to the 1993-94 pools 
will return between $2 and 3 less than last year. Australian 
Wheat Board managing director, John Lawrenson, said the United 
States subsidy is hurting Australian sales program.
