WORLD; 
CHINESE SHRUG OFF COUNTER RALLY 
Burned effigies of China's most famous dissident and slogans supporting Premier 
Li Peng failed today to fire up the 4,000 people attending the first 
government-sponsored rally in six weeks of political turmoil. 
Many participants said officials told them to attend the rally, the latest 
effort by conservatives to discredit the pro-democracy student movement and 
consolidate their position in a power struggle with moderates. 
Effigies of astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, an outspoken dissident who has 
campaigned for democracy, were torched at the rally at a stadium in Daxing 
county, about 20 miles south of central Beijing.
