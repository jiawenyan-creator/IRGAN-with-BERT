FT  30 APR 91 / China banks lose HK share
THE MARKET share of Hong Kong domestic banking loans provided by the Bank of
China and its 12 sister banks declined last year for the second year in
succession after China's Tiananmen Square crisis when there was a sudden
withdrawal of deposits.
This is believed to reflect a realisation by the Bank of China group that it
is politically vulnerable to local protests in Hong Kong and should
therefore adopt a conservative lending approach.
Its share of loans for use in Hong Kong fell from 14 per cent in 1989 to 13
per cent, compared with 16 per cent in 1988, although the total amount of
loans rose from HKDollars 88bn (Pounds 6.62bn) in 1989 to HKDollars 102bn
last year.
Total deposits with the banks also rose sharply from HKDollars 196bn in 1989
to HKDollars 254bn last year, according to the annual report of Hong Kong's
banking commissioner published yesterday. This indicates that the strength
of feeling that caused people to withdraw their money in June 1989 has
evaporated.
The number of banks registered in Hong Kong rose to 168 last year, up from
165 in 1989. Restricted banking licences, introduced in February last year,
were issued to 13 overseas banks.
