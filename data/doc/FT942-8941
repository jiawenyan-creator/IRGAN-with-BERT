FT  18 MAY 94 / Observer: Going for gold
Broken Hill, Kalgoorlie . . ? Forget it.
The latest Australian gold mine is located far closer to the department of
consumer affairs for New South Wales. Unfortunately, though, the government
has noticed - and shut it down.
Since Sydney won the right to stage the Olympic Games in the year 2000, some
240 smart alicks have registered business names incorporating the likes of
'Olympic', 'Sydney 2000' and 'Games City'.
The idea is to flog them on, in due course and for a suitable sum, to the
sports marketeers.
With local Olympic sponsorship revenues expected to exceed ADollars 425m,
the authorities have had a bit of a panic about how to protect their brand
from 'ambush marketing'.
Hence the state law decreeing that entrepreneurs will need government
consent to use any such title - which they won't get.
