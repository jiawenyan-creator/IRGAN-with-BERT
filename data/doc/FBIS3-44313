  [Text] Beijing, 31 Dec (XINHUA) -- A Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said here today that the position of the Chinese side 
regarding the holding of Sino-British negotiations to solve the 
Hong Kong issue has not changed. The door to negotiations is 
open, but the key lies in the attitude of the British side. 
  According to a report, a British Foreign Ministry spokesman 
said in London on 30 December that the British side had not 
received an official note on the suspension of the negotiations 
sent by the Chinese side. Some reporters have asked the Foreign 
Ministry to verify this report. 
  An answer by the spokesman said: The Chinese side made clear 
to the British side on 29 December through diplomatic channels: 
If the British side sincerely wishes to resume negotiations, 
this will be possible only if the British side recalls the 
"partial political reform program" which has already been 
submitted to the Legislative Council for deliberation. Since 
the beginning of April, when the Chinese and British sides 
reached agreement on holding negotiations, the Chinese side has, 
on many occasions, told the British side explicitly that if the 
British side submits the so-called constitutional package to the 
Legislative Council for discussion before an agreement is 
reached in the Sino-British talks, it will mean the end of 
negotiations. The British side is very much aware of this. 
Therefore, the responsibility for the current suspension of 
negotiations lies completely with the British side. The 
position of the Chinese side regarding the holding of 
negotiations to solve the issue has remained unchanged. The 
door to negotiations is open, but the key lies in the attitude 
of the British side.
