THE NATION; 
BUSH TO VETO COMPROMISE WAGE HIKE BILL 
The White House said that President Bush will veto compromise legislation 
worked out by the House and Senate to raise the minimum wage from $3.35 to 
$4.55 an hour by 1991. Reacting to the agreement Tuesday between House and 
Senate negotiators on legislation to change the wage rate for the first time in 
eight years, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush continues 
to believe the figure is too high. "The President's position is the same, and 
he reiterated that" during a meeting with Republican senators, the spokesman 
said. "His first proposal (for a $4.25 top rate) was his last proposal. . . . 
He is prepared to veto the bill if they send it up." Bush's stance sets up the 
first showdown on domestic policy involving the new President and the 
Democratic-controlled Congress.
