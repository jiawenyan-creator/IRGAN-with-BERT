  [Text] The chairman of Russia's Liberal-Democratic party 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy addressed Prime-Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin with a formal request for financial injections now 
that his party finds itself in strained circumstances. A press 
statement released by Zhirinovskiy's party said as much. 
  According to Zhirinovskiy, a political party which carried a 
general election is entitled to get financial and material 
support from the government.(The Liberal-Democratic party polled 
23 percent of overall vote in last December's elections to 
Russia's State Duma - IF). The international community 
recognized his victory, said Zhirinovskiy, and people were 
joining his party en masse in all the 89 regions of Russia. 
  Daily, an enormous number of citizens of the Russian and 
other former Soviet republics addressed the party's headquarters 
with a variety of questions, including political and legal, and 
many people came to visit the party's headquarters. All that 
explained the need for a well-prepared staff under the party's 
60-member Central Committee. 
  In the meantime, the Central and Moscow committees, as well 
as the party's youth wing were headquartered in a building that 
was crying out for repairs. 
  A decision to offer the Liberal-Democrats new headquarters 
and financial aid would, in Zhirinovskiy's view, meet the will 
of most Russians.
