COMMERCIAL SCENE; 
SOUTHERN PACIFIC MOVING ITS L.A. HEADQUARTERS TO MONTEREY PARK 
A major move is in progress as Southern Pacific Transportation Co. relocates to 
new headquarters in the Los Angeles Corporate Center in Monterey Park. 
The firm moves 6 miles east, after 80 years in the Pacific Electric Building at 
610 S. Main St., constructed in 1905 as Los Angeles' largest office building at 
10 stories high. 
The company signed a 10-year, $18-million lease for an 83,000-square-foot 
building in the 100-acre Corporate Center with Ellis Sloan Burnett Properties 
and Metropolitan Life Insurance, joint-venture partners in the development of 
the center. 
The move, Southern Pacific President Mike Mohan said, "is consistent with the 
streamlining of operations of the company, which involves redeployment of SP 
resources to carry out its business plan for the 1990s and beyond." 
About 350 Southern Pacific employees will settle into new offices this month 
and in early October, in a consolidation of some Southern California rail, real 
estate and administrative functions of the company. 
Negotiations for the Los Angeles Corporate Center lease, were handled by the 
Faulkner Co. of Los Angeles for Southern Pacific and by leasing representatives 
for Corporate Center for Ellis Sloan Burnett and Metropolitan Life.
