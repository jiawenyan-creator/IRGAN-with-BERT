THE STATE; 
SAN JOSE SCHOOL STRIKE IS LIKELY 
A strike loomed for the 29,000-student San Jose school district as contract 
talks between district officials and teachers' representatives broke down. 
Supt. James Baughman said the district had rejected the latest demand from 
teachers for a 10% raise this year and a retroactive raise of 6% for last year. 
The district is offering 6% this year with a 1% salary bonus. Teachers are 
expected to strike when school opens Tuesday, but district officials said they 
will try to keep classes operating.
