MOVIE REVIEW; 
'KNICKKNACK': GIMMICK WORTH WAITING FOR 
"Knickknack," the latest film from Pixar's award-winning computer animation 
team of John Lasseter, William Reeves and Eben Ostby, made its belated debut in 
"The Second Animation Celebration: The Movie!" earlier this week at selected 
theaters. It was worth waiting for: "Knickknack" is even better than "Luxo Jr." 
and the Oscar-winning "Tin Toy." 
The film centers on the little snowman inside one of those tacky souvenir 
paperweights filled with plastic snow. His elaborate but unsuccessful attempts 
to escape from his tiny prison are reminiscent of Wile E. Coyote's baroque 
schemes. The slightly artificial movements of computer animation are well 
suited to these plastic characters. There are no distorted humans, like the 
monstrous baby in "Tin Toy," and the swirling snow inside the paperweight would 
be a nightmare to animate by hand. 
A sure crowd-pleader, "Knickknack" may well earn Pixar its third Oscar 
nomination.CHARLES SOLOMON
