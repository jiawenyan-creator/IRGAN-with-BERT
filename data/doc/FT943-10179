FT  06 AUG 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices
Prices of all grades of pepper, both black and white, increased considerably
during the week, reports Man Producten. pepper for prompt delivery and
shipment positions improved strongly in a market where little or no supply
is available on the spot in Europe. It became increasingly difficult to
obtain suitable material from origin as the supply position there also
seemed to be getting much tighter. Spot white pepper traded at USDollars
3,150-Dollars 3,200 a tonne and spot black, fair average quality, at Dollars
1875-Dollars 1900. The 'asta' grades exceeded Dollars 2,000 a tonne. We
expect black pepper prices to continue rising whereas whitesmay stabilise or
ease off a bit.
