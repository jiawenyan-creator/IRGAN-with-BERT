FT  27 OCT 93 / PM defends record on unemployment
MR JOHN Major, the prime minister, yesterday resisted strong criticism from
Labour MPs about the level of joblessness, saying that the unemployment
total had stabilised and was far better in Britain than in Europe.
Despite new indications that confidence in the UK economy is weakening, Mr
Major said recent reductions in the jobless figures 'confirm the underlying
strength of the economy'.
'Unemployment fell last month amongst both men and women in every region in
every part of the country,' he told the Commons at Question Time.
'Unemployment is falling in this country whereas it is not falling in other
countries.' He said that opposition MPs who had forecast that unemployment
was at 3.5m would now have to admit that it was 'under 3m and falling'.
The prime minister also stressed the need for a speedy resolution to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks. European Community heads of
government are due to meet in Brussels on Friday, when the deadlock between
France and its EC partners over Gatt issues will be high on the agenda.
