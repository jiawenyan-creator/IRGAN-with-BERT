FT  12 MAY 94 / Speculative office projects return to City
Work is beginning on the first large speculative office projects to be built
in the City of London since the property market went into recession more
than three years ago.
London and Manchester Group, a life insurance company, is building a 214,000
sq ft building at Finsbury Pavement that will include 125,000 sq ft of
offices and a 96,000 sq ft department store for Marks and Spencer.
The site, bought by London and Manchester in 1987, was sold to Land and
Property Trust, a company now in liquidation, for Pounds 75m in 1989. London
and Manchester repurchased the site for Pounds 17.5m in 1992.
The company has cleared the site and work is expected to begin at the end of
the month. The glass and steel building has been designed by architects
Sheppard Robson.
The building is one of a handful of speculative City developments where work
has or is about to begin. Wates City of London Properties has started work
on a 57,000 sq ft office scheme at Cheapside, while British Land is
installing the foundations for a 160,000 sq ft office scheme at the Corn
Exchange in the City.
Developers are reacting to improved demand from tenants and a reduction in
the number of good-quality vacant properties. 'There have been no
speculative office developments in the City of London for several years and
the supply of good quality, well-located office schemes is now declining
quite rapidly,' said Mr David Low, group property manager of London and
Manchester Assurance.
Mr John Weston Smith of British Land said: 'There will be a shortage of
space by the time our building is ready for leasing up in early 1996.'
Richard Ellis, a firm of chartered surveyors, estimates that 2.8m sq ft of
space was taken up by tenants during the first three months of this year -
the highest quarterly take-up since 1989. Central London office vacancy
rates have fallen by 26 per cent during the year to 19m sq ft.
The improvement in the City office market is encouraging other developers to
bring forward proposals. Mirror Group Newspapers has applied for planning
permission to redevelop its old headquarters on Holborn Circus.
MGN intends to build three self-contained buildings designed by Sir Norman
Foster, comprising 818,435 sq ft gross of offices, 12,782 sq ft of shops and
16,000 sq ft for a pub. The proposed building, which would have nine storeys
and be 50m high, would obstruct the view of St Paul's Cathedral less than
the existing building which is 12 storeys and 70m high.
In the past year, the take-up of offices has focused on modern space,
according to Richard Ellis. The availability of new developments in central
London has fallen by 45 per cent since March 1993, whereas the amount of
second-hand space on the market has dropped by only 17 per cent.
