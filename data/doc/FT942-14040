FT  22 APR 94 / Ankara in talks with IMF
Turkey is negotiating with the International Monetary Fund for a standby
facility to help underpin its recently unveiled austerity programme, a
senior Turkish official confirmed in London yesterday. Mr Emre Gonensay,
senior adviser to President Suleyman Demirel, said Ankara's financing
request from the Fund 'was of the order of Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 820m).' He
also confirmed that Turkey is talking to several US banks about a possible
club loan.
A senior treasury official said that, following an IMF mission expected in
Ankara next week, a letter of intent could be signed by the end of May
paving the way for Turkey to return to the commercial debt markets. The
country needs Dollars 4.5bn just to repay maturing debt in 1994. Total debt
now stands at Dollars 66bn. Turkey borrowed around Pounds 4bn in 1993, all
of it in the bond markets. Officials yesterday ruled out an early return to
the bond markets until the IMF facility was in place.
