CLOTHESLINES: HANDLING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM 
Question: I know that Fergie caused quite a stir last fall when a stiff wind 
blew her skirt up, revealing the royal knickers. The Duchess blushed, Prince 
Andrew was said to be furious and later I read that he wanted to know why she 
had not weighted her hems to prevent such incidents. Is that what the Princess 
of Wales uses to keep her skirts in place? Do any American designers offer 
sheer summer dresses with similar weights? -- K.R. 
Answer: I took your question to London's Bruce Oldfield, who designs many of 
the clothes worn by Princess Di. Oldfield, who designed the satin jacket and 
chiffon skirt illustrated here for Her Royal Highness, said he placed lead 
weights at strategic points around the hem, usually at the seams, to prevent 
the skirt from showing too much royal leg. He says he buys nickel-size weights 
at Harrod's in London, but assumes they would be available at most American 
drapery shops because weighting draperies was their original use. I don't know 
of an American designer who uses such devices to weight skirts, but if you are 
worried about keeping your skirts down in the wind, why not follow Oldfield's 
lead and sew in your own weights?
