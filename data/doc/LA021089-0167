NATION; 
3 OKLAHOMA PLAYERS NAMED IN RAPE 
Prosecutors charged three Oklahoma football players with first-degree rape 
today in an alleged gang rape at a university athletic dormitory. 
Nigel Clay, Glen Bell and Bernard Hall are accused of raping a 20-year-old 
woman at the dormitory on Jan. 21, Dist. Atty. Tully McCoy said. Clay and Hall 
also were charged with two counts each of furnishing alcohol to a minor. The 
charges are the result of an investigation into an Edmond woman's report that 
she was gang-raped at the athletic dormitory.
