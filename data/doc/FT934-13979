FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bankers Trust issues Portuguese
warrants
BANKERS Trust has launched two new issues of warrants on Portuguese
government bonds - the first derivatives on the country's 10-year benchmark
bonds.
Portuguese bonds surged after the government last week announced plans to
lift the withholding tax for non-resident investors.
This triggered heavy foreign buying, which pushed the 10 5/8 per cent
10-year benchmark up nearly four points to 111.70 yesterday.
The yield dropped 59 basis points to 8.99 per cent on an annual basis.
Capitalising on the increase in investor interest in Portugal, Bankers Trust
issued 2.5m straight call warrants and 1m down-and-in calls late on Friday.
The latter tranche was increased to 1.5m yesterday in response to strong
demand, said Mr Antonio Beck, a managing director at Bankers Trust.
The nine-month call warrants give holders the right to buy one 10 5/8 per
cent Portuguese government bond due 2003 at 111.00 on July 15 1994, the
warrants' expiry date.
The warrants, issued at Dollars 3.30, closed at Dollars 3.44 bid yesterday.
For those investors who feel that the rally has peaked and is poised for a
correction, Bankers Trust issued down-and-in calls priced at Dollars 2.45
each.
Under this novel structure, the holder will be paid the difference between
111 and the prevailing market price on July 15 1994 if the price of the bond
drops below 109 during the life of the warrant.
If the price stays above 109, the holder is merely refunded the full
premium.
This tranche, which was privately placed, closed at Dollars 2.59 bid
yesterday.
