  [Text] Shanghai, June 9 (XINHUA) -- The China Society of 
Creativity Studies was set up in Shanghai today. 
  The study of creativity is an emerging science researching 
the creativity of human beings, applications of creative 
thinking, and the processes involved in human discovery and 
invention. 
  In the late 1970s, Chinese experts and scholars entered the 
study of creativity. Over the past ten-plus years, a dozen 
societies promoting the study were set up in Shanghai and other 
provinces and cities. 
  Scholars in the study have published more than 30 
compilations of works in the field. 
  The number of experts engaged in the study has increased 
from 
about 200 a decade ago to several tens of thousands now. 
  There are 48 universities in China which now offer courses 
in 
the study of creativity. 
  Approved by the State Commission of Science and Technology, 
the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the China Association for 
Science and Technology, the society will devote its efforts to 
international and domestic academic exchanges and promote the 
development, application and popularization of the study in 
China.
