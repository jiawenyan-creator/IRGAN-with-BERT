FT  07 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich up 1.9%, responds to US
equity strength
Bourses were mostly sleepy, although Zurich and Tel Aviv managed to take
sentiment to extremes, writes Our Markets Staff.
ZURICH pushed 1.9 per cent higher, led by the strength of the futures market
in a belated response to Friday's performance on Wall Street. The SMI index
rose 53.0 to 2,781.4, decisively above recent resistance at 2,770, prompting
expectations that the index could now be heading for the 2,820 level.
Roche certificates, under further pressure last week, bounced SFr170 to
SFr6,880. Renewed support was noted from Mr Martin Ebner's BZ Bank, with the
market unperturbed by news that the pharmaceuticals group had extended the
deadline for its agreed takeover of Syntex to July 1 after the US Federal
Trade Commission asked for more information on the deal.
Sandoz registered added SFr9 at SFr700, their best performance since the
group's bid for Gerber, the US babyfood producer, a fortnight ago.
Financials were in demand on stronger bond futures. UBS bearers moved ahead
SFr30 to SFr1,245 and SBC bearers put on SFr13 at SFr430. CS Holding
bearers, trading ex the dividend and a shareholder option, rose SFr18 to
SFr611.
FRANKFURT featured an afternoon conflict between its bond and equity
markets, the former influenced by qualified encouragement on interest rate
and inflation prospects by Mr Dieter Hiss, a Bundesbank council member, and
the latter watching Wall Street rise.
The Dax index extended Friday's carefree, but lightweight, pattern, climbing
14.68 to 2,163.07 on the session and holding its ground after hours to end
at an Ibis-indicated 2,163.59. Turnover stayed low, up from DM5.1bn to
DM5.2bn.
However, said Mr Horst-Kaspar Greven at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, most of
the gains came on Friday afternoon when the Dax closed at 2,158.88; and
while equities seemed sleepily content, this was not the case with bonds,
down 25 basis points late in the day when US bonds were 66 points to the
good.
Siemens exemplified the pattern of the day, up DM8.50 at DM708.50 on the
session after its semiconductors subsidiary projected a 29 per cent sales
gain in 1994; but the afternoon close was only DM1.50 higher at DM706.60.
AMSTERDAM built on Friday's gains and the AEX index closed 4.27 up at
407.35, with strength in a broad range of blue chips. Activity was helped by
an unexpected, 10 basis-point cut by the central bank in the special advance
rate.
Wolters Kluwer, the publishing group, improved Fl 1.40 to Fl 112.40 after
Goldman Sachs added it to its European Priority list. The investment bank
said that it expected earnings per share to grow by 19 per cent over the
next three years.
Unilever was among the day's disappointments, the shares declining 70 cents
to Fl 191, as its 'war of words' with Procter &amp; Gamble over the quality of
washing powders entered a new phase.
There was considerable technical trading in Nedlloyd, the transport and
shipping group, under pressure last week with the shares losing some 7 per
cent; this helped it to a gain of Fl 2.10 at Fl 68.00.
PARIS could find little to motivate activity and the CAC-40 index moved in a
narrow 20 point range before closing off 5.49 at 2,037.15. Turnover eased to
FFr3.9bn.
Euro Disney was again one of the few highlights, the stock rising FFr2.00 or
almost 6 per cent to FFr36.50, as more buyers came into the market following
last week's news of a capital injection by a Saudi prince. Carrefour dipped
FFr7 to FFr1,910 as the retailer noted a 7 per cent rise in sales between
January and May.
MADRID followed afternoon weakness in the bond market, the general index
losing most of its early gains to close 0.77 higher at 327.06 in turnover of
Pta28.8bn. For Kleinwort Benson, Ms Clare Miles advised investors to hold,
saying that the economic recovery was continuing and that, each month, more
indicators have been showing a reocvery of demand and output.
Construction stocks were among the better performers, Cubiertas rising
Pta340 to Pta11,990, Pta200 to Pta15,400 and Huarte Pta65 to Pta1,905.
MILAN marked time, the Comit index nudging 2.57 higher to 738.93 in very
quiet trading.
Montedison was exceptionally active, adding L28 or 2 per cent to L1,458 in
hefty volume of 27.4m shares as expectations grew that its proposed plastics
merger with Shell would win the blessing of the European Union tomorrow.
The shares also benefited from rumours that Gemina might be building a
stake: the financial holding company, which said on Friday that it had
liquid funds of L320bn, put on L30 to L1,681.
STOCKHOLM found support in gains by Astra and Volvo, the Affarsvarlden index
gaining 9.1 to 1,487.0.
Astra A shares gained SKr4 to SKr172 on speculation that it was close to
assuaging German worries about its best-selling Losec ulcer treatment. Volvo
B shares rose SKr23 to SKr747 in response to reports that sales volume rose
by 25 per cent in the first five months of the year.
TEL AVIV dived 6 per cent, wiping out all of Sunday's 4 per cent gain, with
mutual funds being seen as heavy sellers. The Mishtanim index finished 10.48
down at 172.30 in high turnover of Shk260m.
