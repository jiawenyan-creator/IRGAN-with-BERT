FT  14 JAN 93 / Honeckers leaves prison due to ill health
Mr Erich Honecker leaves prison yesterday before starting his journey to
join his wife and daughter in Chile. The 80-year-old former East German
leader ended 169 days in prison after a constitutional court ruled he was
too ill to stand trial, Leslie Colitt writes from Berlin. Mr Honecker has
liver cancer and is not expected to live long. The court ruling said his
detention was senseless as he would not survive until the end of the trial.
He was charged with manslaughter over the fatal border shooting of 13 East
Germans trying to escape to the west. Outside Moabit prison, a knot of
supporters cheered the man they regard as an anti-Nazi hero.
