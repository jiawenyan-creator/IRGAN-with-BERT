FT  18 MAR 93 / Observer: Over-proud
While national rivalry has been a potent force for good and ill, it is
perhaps less well understood as a force for deliberately inflating a firm's
accounts. National pride is, however, the only explanation building products
group Expamet International can offer for the behaviour of managers at what
used to be its Netherlands duct-making subsidiary, Brema-Air.
They were recently discovered to have inflated profit figures because, it
seems, the Dutchmen simply couldn't bear to be seen to lag behind the
group's UK businesses. However, Expamet is not taking the local managers to
court, since none of the miscreants made a penny from their misdeeds.
Indeed, Expamet boss Alex Orr, who understands the intensity of
international rivalries from the days when he ran the mile for Scotland  -
tells me that far from profiting, they even put Pounds 500,000 of their own
money into the company during the audit, although they took it out
afterwards.
