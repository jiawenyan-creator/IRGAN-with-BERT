HARBOR REGIONAL CENTER CONTEST 
An essay and drawing contest in recognition of National Disabilities Awareness 
month is being sponsored by Harbor Regional Center, a nonprofit organization 
that provides free services to 4,000 developmentally disabled children and 
adults in the South Bay-Long Beach areas. 
The contest is open to brothers and sisters of center clients between the ages 
of 3 and 17. According t the Torrance-based center, disabled youngsters often 
take attention away from other children in a family and the contest gives them 
a chance to express themselves. Contest deadline is Monday. For information, 
call 540-1711.
