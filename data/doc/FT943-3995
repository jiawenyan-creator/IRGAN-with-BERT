FT  12 SEP 94 / World News in Brief: Balladur starts review of crime
investigations
Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has started a review of the
legal process for investigating white-collar crime after a series of probes
involving leading industrialists. Interviewed on French television, Balladur
expressed concern that the latest probes had been 'no good for democracy,
for the economy or for the companies themselves'. Balladur said he wanted to
ensure the legal system was operating efficiently. He has asked
representatives of industry, the trade union movement and the judiciary to
conduct the review. Last week, Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman of the
Saint-Gobain glass group, was questioned over alleged illicit political
funding and a Brussels court issued an warrant for the arrest of Didier
Pineau-Valencienne, head of Schneider engineering group.
