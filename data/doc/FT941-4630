FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Guinness Peat Group advances to Pounds 28m
Guinness Peat Group, the UK investment vehicle of New Zealand entrepreneur
Sir Ron Brierley, yesterday reported a sharp increase in 1993 pre-tax profit
to Pounds 27.7m, boosted by a profit of Pounds 4.64m on disposals. It
compared with Pounds 7.75m last time.
The company also announced a 1-for-10 rights issue at 25p - a 28 per cent
discount to yesterday's closing price of 34.5p. The company, which has
existing cash resources of Pounds 29.5m, said it would raise Pounds 8.5m
from the issue to fund further investments.
Figures include a maiden contribution from the Brown Shipley merchant
banking group, acquired last April. BSH showed a Pounds 0.5m pre-tax loss,
but contributed Pounds 2.2m from the sale of a subsidiary.
GPG said that following the sale of its fund management operations, Brown
Shipley has net cash balances of Pounds 6m, compared with its purchase price
of Pounds 5.6m.
GPG operating profit was Pounds 23.6m, up from Pounds 8.7m. The company had
an active year following the lifting of its share suspension in November
1992. It has sold a number of businesses, and built up investments in
Physicians Insurance Company of Ohio, and Australian-listed companies,
Australis Media, and ASC.
The company's principal business, its 56 per cent stake in Tyndall
Australia, the life assurance and fund management group, performed well and
remained the main source of earnings.
GPG said that the market value of its share portfolio was at a Pounds 12m
premium to book value, at the year end, and it is reviewing investment
opportunities, primarily in the UK and Australia.
Earnings per share rose to 3.76p (1.39p). The figure was depressed by an
increase in the overall tax rate to 44 per cent, due primarily to Tyndall.
There is no dividend but this 'will be seriously considered in 1995'.
