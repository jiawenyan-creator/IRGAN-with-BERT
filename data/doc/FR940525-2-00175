Airport noise compatibility program. Eight of the ten recommendations of the program were approved, one was approved
in part, and one had no action.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for the Hilo International
Airport, effective May 3, 1994.


Under section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure map may submit to the FAA a noise compatibility program
which sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing incompatible
land uses and prevention of additional incompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps.
The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local
communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel.
Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part
150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR part 150
program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in part 150 and the Act and is limited to
the following determinations:
a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR part 150;
b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing incompatible land uses
around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional incompatible land uses;
c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
types or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas pre-empted
by the Federal Government; and
