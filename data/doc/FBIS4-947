<H5>  After April 27 there will be something more important than </H5>
the ANC government. You. 
  The time for casting blame is over. 
  Now, more than ever, it is the responsibility of every 
person 
and every organisation -- including the ANC -- to ensure that we 
put an end to violence and get on with building a nation. 
  Our plan for a better life for all gives hope because it 
puts 
people first. It will create jobs, give every child 10 years of 
free, quality education, and provide the homes and 
infrastructure our people and country need. 
  The ANC wants you to feel secure in your rights. To feel 
free to express your views. To be secure in your homes. To be 
confident about the quality of education and the flourishing of 
your language and culture. 
  Above all, the ANC wants every South African to know that 
all 
our children will have the opportunity to realise their 
God-given potential, secure in family life in a peaceful and 
thriving society. 
  On April 27, use your vote to elect a government that is 
ready to take responsibility for the task ahead. 
  Let our respect and concern for one another be the very 
thing 
that pulls us together, so that we can at last work together as 
one nation. Then we will surely realise our goal of a better 
life for all." 
  A better life for all. Working together for jobs, peace and 
freedom.
