FT  01 NOV 94 / Kashmiris seize backpackers
A Kashmiri militant group holding three backpackers hostage has threatened
to behead them if 10 of their own men are not freed from jail, the United
News of India agency said. Earlier, a British Foreign Office spokesman said
three Britons and an American had been captured. He named the three Britons
as Paul Ridout of Dorset, Miles Croston of Buckinghamshire and Rhys
Partridge of Suffolk. But hours after the kidnap claim was received, police
said the American was found near New Delhi chained to an iron post,
unharmed. Bela Joseph Nuss told police he had been kidnapped 10 days before.
Voice of America radio received letters containing the kidnap claim,
accompanied by photographs of the hostages held at gunpoint. The group,
calling itself Al Hadid, said it was based in the tribal areas of
Afghanistan. Officials said they had not previously heard of Al Hadid, but
five of the men whose freedom was sought were from militant groups fighting
in Kashmir.
