FT  24 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Wind farms generate storm (3) - David
Lascelles' article on the future of wind energy, published on August 19,
provoked a large number of letters, both for and against the development of
wind power. Here is a selection
Sir, David Lascelles is quite right about wind farms. They are
environmentally menacing while making not the slightest sense in energy
terms. Even at the height of the oil crisis in the early 1980s, when I was
energy secretary, I was never shown any evidence that wind power could
become a remotely economic source of electricity.
Why the government should now be approving these intrusive and moaning
monstrosities in some of the most beautiful areas of our country I cannot
understand. Cornwall and mid-Wales have already been scarred. Now there is a
threat to dot these tall structures along the hills either side of the Upper
Wye Valley.
I hope that on both environmental and energy policy grounds the government
will withdraw its encouragement for any more of this desecration and waste.
If we must have huge wind farms at all, they should be sited on the less
attractive parts of our shoreline.
