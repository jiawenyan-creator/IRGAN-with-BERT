FT  21 OCT 94 / W German industry stronger
The recovery of manufacturing industry in western Germany is picking up
speed and companies are now operating at 83.7 per cent capacity, up from 78
per cent a year ago, according to a report from the Ifo economics institute.
The quantity of orders in hand was returning to pre-recession levels even
though productivity had improved, the report said. For the first time
industry in eastern Germany was 'largely satisfied' with the business
environment. However, companies are still concerned about the low levels of
exports and about the amount of orders in hand which corresponded to 2.7
months work in the third quarter, down from 3.1 months in the quarter
before. Industry in eastern Germany was producing at 78 per cent of its
capacity, slightly more than in the second quarter and up from 72 per cent
in September 1993. Despite the improved figures, around 2 per cent of the
workforce are still likely to lose their jobs.
