PRAISE FOR WORLD CENTER 
Leon Whiteson's critique (July 1) of the First Interstate World Center seemed 
to express a negative opinion of the overall exterior tower, but he is specific 
only when discussing the "awkward change of levels at the shaft's base. The 
"main lobby of 5th Street . . . is confusing" and "The lobby's connection to 
the Hope Street entry four floors above is poorly thought out," may be valid, 
but hardly cause to condemn the building as "an act of architecture only 
secondarily." 
Your photograph rightly shows the "slim white cylinder," and that "the tower 
stands out as the graceful beacon visible for miles," (Whiteson's words from 
the story). Your pictured view is the one I have the opportunity to appreciate 
every day, and to me the upward thrust of the 73 stories is fine; 20 stories 
less would seem abruptly stubby. 
Also I do not think that deals "limited the size of its site," was not the size 
of that site the same before the "deals" as after? As for THAT building ever 
being "our equivalent of Manhattan's Chrysler Building," try putting the 
mandatory heliport on top of a pointy headed building.
