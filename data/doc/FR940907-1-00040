 

``Residual'' securities, typically representing a beneficial interest in whatever cash flows remain in the pool
of financial assets after obligations to pay all other outstanding classes have been satisfied, have been rated.
In a number of cases, because of the highly speculative nature of these cash flows, the residual has incorporated a
fixed promise to pay a nominal amount, e.g., $10,000 principal in the early months of the security's existence, to
the residual holder. The amount of the fixed nominal obligation may have no relationship to the amount paid for the
residual, nor to the anticipated residual cash flow. The credit rating for the residual represents only an evaluation
of the likelihood that the holder will receive the promised nominal amount. Thus, a residual could be rated ``triple-a''
even if there are other securities in the offering that are not. 


2. Non-Credit Payment Evaluations 


In response to developments of derivative and structured securities that have significant non-credit risks, rating
organizations are developing analytical models to evaluate the non-credit risks of these instruments. For example,
one rating organization has developed a ``volatility'' rating (``V-Rating''), scaled V1V5, intended to
provide an indication of the volatility (or, conversely, predictability) of a security in total return, price, and
cash flow over a range or various interest rate scenarios.

23

 The volatility of ``current coupon agency certificates''

24

 is used as a benchmark. Classes assigned ratings of V1, V2, and V3 demonstrate volatility less than or equal to current
coupon agency certificates over the range of interest rate scenarios. Classes assigned ratings of V4 and V5 demonstrate
greater volatility over the range of interest rate scenarios than do current coupon agency certificates.

Another rating organization has adopted the practice of attaching a symbol_the letter ``r''_to its traditional
credit rating for certain derivative securities to alert investors that the instruments may experience high volatility
or dramatic fluctuations in their expected returns because of market risk.

26

 The principal function of the ``r'' symbol is to serve as an investor alert. It does not provide a measure or quantification
of the non-credit payment risk (although the rating organization continues in its efforts to develop market-risk
measures which might quantify non-credit payment risk).

27

 The rating organization notes, however, that ``[t]he absence of an ``r'' symbol should not be taken as an indication
that an obligation will exhibit no volatility or variability in total return.''

A new rating permutation has evolved in response to the creation of cash flow securities, also known as ``kitchen-sink''
bonds.

29

 A cash flow security represents an interest in a pool of several classes of previously issued unrelated mortgage backed
securities, which typically are highly sensitive to principal prepayment speed and have volatile yields. Because
each underlying security may have been issued at different times, be backed by different pools of mortgage loans,
have different allocations of principal and interest among the various classes, and perform differently in various
interest rate and prepayment rate environments, the performance of the cash flow security will reflect a combination
of the performance characteristics of the various underlying securities. In registered cash flow bond offerings
seen to date, where the aggregate stated principal amounts of the underlying pooled securities was less than the stated
principal balance of the cash flow securities, the cash flow securities would not qualify for a ``triple a'' credit
rating with respect to principal repayment.

Two rating organizations separately have developed and applied a methodology to analyze the likelihood of receipt
of a specified amount of cash flow (combined interest and principal payments on the underlying assets) from the pooled
securities, without regard to whether such payment amount constitutes interest or principal repayment.

30

 Assessing the likelihood of receipt of this cash flow combines both a credit rating and non-credit payment evaluation
of prepayments on the underlying pooled securities. Applying prepayment analysis to determine the likelihood of
receipt of aggregate cash flows represents a significant development in rating techniques.

The cash flow ratings do not address the likelihood of receipt of the original principal amount of the cash flow security
or the receipt of any specified amount of interest; the rating assesses the likelihood of receiving a specified dollar
amount of cash over the life of the security. Because the cash flow rating does not address the marketed or expected
promises, a cash flow rating may be viewed as a limited scope rating in that it does not rate the likelihood of payment
in accordance with the instrument's actual or expected terms. 
Initially, cash flow ratings were assigned the same rating designations as assigned for traditional credit ratings.
One rating organization has appended, and the other has expressed a willingness to append, a suffix to rating designations
for cash flow securities.
