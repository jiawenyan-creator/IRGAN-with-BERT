FT  22 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei flat as region
scores four new highs
MOST investors retreated to the sidelines to wait for next week's listing of
East Japan Railway, and the Nikkei average closed marginally higher after
prices had moved within a narrow trading range, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei was finally up 6.00 at 20,179.42 after a day's low of 20,108.81
and high of 20,219.72. Public fund managers and arbitrageurs were
late-morning buyers, but index-linked selling later eroded most of the
gains. Volume totalled 228m shares, against 223m, as falls overwhelmed rises
by 722 to 289, with 167 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks shed 2.30 to 1,645.56. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
edged up 0.80 to 1,288.86.
Market participants anticipate that the JR East listing next Tuesday will
help to activate the market, and also expect that a successful listing will
prompt the lifting of an informal ban on new public share offerings, which
has been in place since March 1990.
Telecommunications-related stocks lost ground on profit-taking. NTT receded
Y13,000 to Y871,000 and DDI, on the second section, relinquished Y158,000 to
Y6.51m.
Game makers were lower on reports of shrinking profits: Sega Enterprises
fell Y500 to Y9,250, Konami Y150 to Y3,740 and Namco Y100 to Y2,800.
Higher prices in pharmaceutical issues in New York encouraged investors:
Takeda Chemical rose Y10 to Y1,330 and Yamanouchi Y30 to Y2,370.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 70.90 to 22,085.22 in volume of 15.4m
shares. The index lost ground for the fourth straight day as small-lot
profit-taking depressed share prices.

lower at 2,683.0.
