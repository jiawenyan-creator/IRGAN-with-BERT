  [Excerpts] Athens, 12 May (ITAR-TASS) -- "All initiatives 
concerning the fundamental interests of stability and security 
in Europe are best to be implemented within the CSCE framework." 
Such is the position taken by the Russian diplomacy on the pact 
for stability in Europe which is planned to be signed on 26-27 
May in Paris, as members of the Russian delegation that took 
part in a preparatory meeting of senior officials held in Athens 
on Thursday told an ITAR-TASS correspondent today. 
  The meeting was attended by delegations from almost all 
European countries, the United States and Canada, as well as 
seven international organizations including the United Nations, 
CSCE, the European Commission, WEU [Western European Union] and 
NATO. The CIS countries were represented by delegations from 
Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova. Armenia and Azerbaijan 
were present as observers. [passage omitted] 
  As ITAR-TASS correspondent learned, Russian diplomatic 
circles are especially concerned about the question of borders. 
Russia believes that this question should be considered only on 
the basis of such fundamental principles of the CSCE as 
inviolability of the borders, respect for territorial integrity 
of the states and their sovereignty. [passage omitted]
