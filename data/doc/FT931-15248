FT  14 JAN 93 / Japan and EC seek to monitor trade: Meetings to discuss
working group to look into Dollars 29bn surplus
JAPANESE ministers and EC commissioners will try to reach agreement tomorrow
on how to monitor bilateral trade between the EC and Japan - a move the
Commission believes could indirectly help reduce Japan's growing trade
surplus with the Community.
Commissioners begin informal meetings with five Japanese ministers today in
Brussels, in preparation for tomorrow's formal discussions on political and
economic relations between the EC and Japan.
The Japanese group is headed by Mr Michio Watanabe, deputy prime minister
and foreign minister, and Mr Yashiro Mori from the Ministry for
International Trade and Industry (Miti).
Officials in Brussels said yesterday that setting up a working group to
monitor Japan's growing trade surplus with the EC would allow the Community
and Japan to spot if structural barriers were keeping EC producers and
products out of the Japanese market.
Figures for January to November 1992 show a surplus of Dollars 29.2bn
(Pounds 19.2bn) on trade with the EC - 17.2 per cent up on the equivalent
period.
A working group was first proposed by the EC last May, as part of an effort
to develop the 1991 EC-Japan declaration on political and economic
co-operation. Attempts to improve monitoring have been thwarted since then
by disputes about the proper statistics to use. But Japanese officials said
yesterday they thought agreement would be reached on the establishment of
such a group, although it might prove more difficult to fix the experts'
'terms of reference'.
The Commission is also expected to urge Japan to avoid signing bilateral
agreements which might discriminate against other trading partners, such as
Japan's free-trade pact with the US on semiconductors.
