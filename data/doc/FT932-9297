FT  14 MAY 93 / People: Non-executives
Brent Walker, the pubs and betting shops group which last year completed a
Pounds 1.65bn refinancing, has strengthened its board with a second recruit
from the property world. Stuart McDonald, a long time associate of the
Beckwith brothers, the property developers, has joined the board as a
non-executive director.
McDonald, who resigned from London &amp; Edinburgh Trust last September, along
with the Beckwith brothers, has a strong financial background. He spent his
early career on the corporate finance side of N M Rothschild before becoming
joint chief executive of LET where his duties included group finance
together with control of group banking and institutional relationships.
McDonald is the second non-executive to be recruited by Brent Walker's new
chairman, Sir Keith Bright. Sir Brian Goswell, senior partner of Healey
Baker, joined the board in March.
