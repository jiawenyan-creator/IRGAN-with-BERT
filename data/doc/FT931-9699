FT  12 FEB 93 / Spending growth rate slows: Trend is still consistent with
solid US recovery
THE RATE of growth of US consumer spending slowed last month but remained
consistent with a solid economic recovery, figures from the Commerce
Department indicated yesterday.
After seasonal adjustment, retail sales grew 0.3 per cent last month and by
6.6 per cent in the year to January. Analysts had expected an increase of
about 0.5 per cent.
The increase was led by a 1.1 per cent monthly rise in sales of motor
vehicles and access-ories. Excluding vehicles, retail sales were up only 0.1
per cent.
However, few analysts expected the pre-Christmas surge in consumer spending
to be sustained. Yesterday's figures appeared consistent with projections of
real growth of consumer spending at an annual rate of perhaps 2.5 per cent
in the current quarter, down from 4.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of last
year.
Officials also announced substantial, but largely offsetting, revisions to
previous months' figures. December figures were revised down to show an
increase of 0.8 per cent over November rather than an increase of 1.2 per
cent reported earlier. However, November sales were revised up to show a
fall of 0.1 per cent rather than a fall of 0.5 per cent.
The net effect was to leave sales in the three months to January 7.2 per
cent higher than in the same period last year. The figures do not allow for
price inflation of about 3 per cent over the period.
Separate figures yesterday showed a 12,000 decline to 340,000 in claims for
state unemployment insurance in the week ending January 30, consistent with
a gradual improvement in employment prospects.
