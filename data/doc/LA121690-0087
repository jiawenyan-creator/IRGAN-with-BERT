SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN MARINO; 
SCHOOL SPEED ZONES SET 
The City Council has created school speed zones along Huntington Drive, 
lowering the speed limit from 40 to 25 m.p.h. when children are present. 
The council Wednesday voted 4 to 0 to approve the change after learning the 
city does not need permission from Caltrans to lower the speed limit.
