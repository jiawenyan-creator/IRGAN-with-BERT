  [Text] On 19 May, Jose Altino Machado, businessman and 
leader of the gold prospectors, said all the gold miners who 
were prospecting illegally at the Venezuelan border already have 
left that region. He reported, however, that 11 of them are 
missing and that the two Brazilians detained in Puerto Ayacucho 
were taken to Caracas on 19 May. 
  According to Machado, the decision to leave the region was 
made by the Federation of Legal Amazon Region Gold-Prospectors 
(USAGAL), an organization he heads. About 300 gold prospectors 
have gathered in Pista do Mineiro in Brazilian territory and are 
being transported in light airplanes to Boa Vista. 
  Machado is surprised that Venezuela is bombing only the 
border area when in Venezuela there are more than 16,000 
Brazilian gold prospectors working without harrassment. He said 
those Brazilians have prerogatives because they contribute money 
to politicians and police. He added: "That is very good for the 
pockets of some Venezuelan officials." 
  Machado believes this is the reason Venezuelan officials 
want 
to try him, to make illegal gold prospecting a personal issue. 
Machado is willing to go to Caracas if his right to defense and 
guarantees for his physical safety are assured.
