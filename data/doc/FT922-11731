FT  24 APR 92 / Population growth to hit environment
STEEP INCREASES in world population could lead to catastrophic environmental
damage and loss of species and natural habitats, according to a study funded
by organisations including the United Nations Population Fund and the World
Wide Fund for Nature.*
It says the UN anticipates world population could level out at 11.5bn by the
end of the next century compared with today's 5.4bn. But upper forecasts put
the figure at 12.5bn by 2050 and 28bn by 2150. The 1990s will be the decade
of fastest population growth in history, with an extra 97m people every
year.
It advocates a massive programme for women, giving them access to family
planning methods, education and health.
