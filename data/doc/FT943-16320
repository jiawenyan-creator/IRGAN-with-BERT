FT  05 JUL 94 / Brewer lifted 22% by pubs purchase
A strong first-time contribution from the Chef &amp; Brewer pub acquisition
helped Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the drinks and leisure group, to a 22 per cent
rise in pre-tax profit for the year to May 1, to Pounds 222m. However,
earnings per share rose only 1.2 per cent, as a result of the rights issue
which helped finance the Pounds 700m deal.
A six-month contribution of Pounds 32.3m in operating profit from Chef &amp;
Brewer, together with an 8 per cent rise in profits from leisure, more than
offset a sharp fall of 11 per cent in brewing. Mr Brian Stewart, chief
executive, said that while beer sales had fallen 2 per cent in the year,
volume in the current year was up 4 per cent.
Volume sales of branded beer to the pub trade had fallen 3.4 per cent in a
market down 2.5 per cent, he said. In off-licence sales, sales were down 2.4
per cent in a market up by 2.5 per cent. This was chiefly due to S&amp;N's
refusal to lower its prices, Mr Stewart said.
The Chef and Brewer acquisition from Grand Metropolitan could not have gone
better, claimed Mr Stewart. 'We had a natural Scottish caution in buying
from Sir Allen (Sheppard, GrandMet chairman), so we were all the more
careful in doing our sums.' Like-for-like turnover at Chef &amp; Brewer had
risen 5 per cent on a cumulative basis over 6 months, having been running at
1-2 per cent at the time of acquisition. The deal had not contributed to
group beer volume in the past year, but was expected to add around 2 per
cent this year.
In the leisure division, Center Parcs had done well in the UK, but occupancy
in France fell from 94 per cent to 85 per cent.
The retail division (excluding Chef &amp; Brewer) had sales of Pounds 290.8m
(Pounds 289.3m), and operating profit of Pounds 56.4m (Pounds 53.3m). Chef &amp;
Brewer's sales in the second half were Pounds 230.6m and operating profits
Pounds 32.3m.
Beer sales were Pounds 870.9m (Pounds 889.2m) and profits were Pounds 86.0m
(Pounds 96.2m). Leisure contributed Pounds 83.1m profit (Pounds 77.0m) on
sales of Pounds 367.5m (Pounds 335.4m).
After interest charges were Pounds 37.6m (Pounds 26.1m). Earnings per share
were 33.1p (32.7p). The final dividend was raised 5.5 per cent to 11.26p,
making 17.04p (16.22p) for the year, a rise of 5.1 per cent. The shares fell
3p to 501p.
