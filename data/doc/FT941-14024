FT  22 JAN 94 / Genetic science controls eased
The government yesterday announced the first relaxation of controls over the
release of genetically engineered organisms in response to complaints that
present regulations are too time-consuming and bureaucratic.
The Department of the Environment is introducing a 'fast-track' approvals
process for field trials of plants whose genes have been modified.
