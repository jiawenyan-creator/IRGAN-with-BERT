FT  24 JUL 92 / Palestinians seek more settlements concessions
ISRAEL yesterday ordered a permanent block on new government-backed Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories, but said it would allow completion
of almost 9,000 housing units already under construction.
The move, entrenching last week's temporary new building freeze, was in line
with commitments by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to curb expansion of
settlements, regarded as an obstacle to Middle East peace talks.
But it was sharply criticised by Palestinians for falling short of their
demand for a complete freeze on all building. They said completion of units
under construction meant the settler population could rise by 50 per cent
from its present level of 100,000. 'It is a beginning but it certainly is
not enough,' said Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman.
Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the previous prime minister, and settler leaders bitterly
condemned the announcement, saying it signalled the abandonment of their
claim to eternal Israeli rule over the occupied territories. 'For me this is
a nightmare,' Mr Shamir said. 'It is impossible that the majority of the
public will not show full opposition to all these measures which may lead
Israel into a labyrinth of significant dangers.'
Officials said Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, had been briefed on
the measures. Israel is optimistic Washington will now approve Dollars 10bn
(Pounds 5.25bn) in loan guarantees held up because Mr Shamir refused to
freeze settlements.
