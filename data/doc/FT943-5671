FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Independent Newspapers advances
to IPounds 15.2m
Independent Newspapers, the Irish newspaper group controlled by Mr Tony
O'Reilly, reported a rise in pre-tax profits from IPounds 14.6m to IPounds
15.2m (Pounds 14.1m) for the half year to June 30.
The increase reflected better margins in Irish publishing operations,
improved trading conditions overseas and first-time contributions from
acquisitions in the UK and South Africa.
Independent's Irish operations accounted for IPounds 64.5m (IPounds 63.3m)
of turnover of IPounds 96.6m (IPounds 81.5m), and contributed IPounds 10.6m
(IPounds 9.4m) to operating profits of IPounds 15.8m (IPounds 11.7m).
Margins were enhanced by rationalisation and increased advertising revenue,
according to Mr Liam Healy, chief executive.
Independent has a 29.9 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing, owner of the
UK titles, The Independent and The Independent on Sunday. Bought for IPounds
23.3m last February, the stake is treated as an investment and was the main
cause of a rise in net interest costs from IPounds 751,000 to IPounds
978,000.
Earnings per share were 9.28p (11.93p) and the interim dividend goes up from
an adjusted 2.67p to 3p.
COMMENT
The strong performance of Independent's core Irish publishing operation
makes it a good play on the recovery prospects of the Irish economy. With
improving advertising revenues feeding through, full-year profit forecasts
of about IPounds 32m seem a little on the low side. Recent circulation
figures show that Independent's titles dominate the Irish daily, evening and
Sunday markets. In the second half the group will make almost half its
operating profits outside Ireland, marking its transition into an
international media group. The prospective p/e is nearly 16 based on
yesterday's closing price of 305p. With the growth prospects, especially in
South Africa, the shares still look reasonable value.
