  [Text] The Bihac Region is still the most troubled part of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. As of last night, chetniks from the 
so-called Serbian Autonomous Region of Krajina have been using 
howitzers to virtually destroy border areas in the Cazin 
Commune. Krivaja, Pjanici, Skokovi, Liskovac, Todorovo, and 
Golubovici are being targeted by the Serbian aggressor, who has, 
more and more, been substituting Abdic's treacherous 
paramilitary, which is in disorder. There have been many wounded 
civilians, some people have been killed, but nobody is assessing 
material damage any longer. Here is a report by Mirza Sadikovic: 
  [Begin Sadikovic recording] This is why the Command of the 
5th Corps made a statement again and the civilian authorities of 
the Bihac Region presented a new (?protest) about the open 
chetnik aggression, in fact carried out from another state, 
which the local UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] members have 
been watching calmly. 
  During the day, members of Abdic's treacherous phalanxes 
also 
continued their wild artillery attacks. Due to an energetic 
response by our fighters, they and their chetnik allies (?began) 
withdrawing artillery deeply into their territory, leaving a 
real wasteland in their wake. 
  Following this morning's energetic responses by the 5th 
Corps 
units, a large part of territories has been liberated, and one 
more entire company from the 2d Brigade, the so-called Kladusa 
National Defense, has been caught and disarmed. Large 
quantities of ammunition, equipment, and armament that Abdic 
especially received from chetniks were confiscated on the 
occasion. [end recording]
