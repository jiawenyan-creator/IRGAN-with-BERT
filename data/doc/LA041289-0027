MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE 
Officials in Stockholm expelled Liza Minnelli's dog from Sweden Tuesday, saying 
she smuggled it into the country in violation of quarantine laws while on tour 
with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. Minnelli took the shaggy Scottish 
terrier, Lilly, into Sweden aboard a car ferry from Denmark and the pet was 
discovered at Minnelli's hotel in Stockholm on Monday night. Two customs 
officials arrived to seize the dog, but Minnelli refused to hand over Lilly and 
threatened to cancel her show Tuesday night with Sinatra and Davis. The 
officials guarded her room all night until Minnelli agreed to fly the dog out 
of the country with one of her assistants Tuesday morning. To keep Sweden free 
from rabies, a dog has to spend four months in quarantine before it is allowed 
in the country.ALEENE MacMINN
