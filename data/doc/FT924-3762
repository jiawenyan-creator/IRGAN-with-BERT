FT  05 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses ease back after an
eventful week
BOURSES were mostly easier after an eventful week, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT fell on the publication of bad west German industrial orders data
which showed a fall for the eighth consecutive month. The DAX index, which
closed down 10.34 at 1,522.16, was barely changed on the week following a
good performance on Monday. Turnover dropped slightly to DM4.4bn from
DM4.7bn.
The industrial orders figures, down some 9 per cent from a year earlier,
re-emphasised the parlous state of the economy and gave further support to
those calling for an early easing in interest rates.
Stocks were broadly weaker on this news while special features affected
others. Volkswagen slipped a further DM3.80 to DM249.50, for a fall of 6.5
per cent on the week, after the group said that it would be holding a
extraordinary supervisory board meeting next month. Some analysts believe
that the vehicle manufacturer will be forced to implement drastic
rationalisation measures since it faces a sharp deterioration in earnings.
Deutsche Bank, expected to report 10-month figures on Tuesday, weakened DM4
to DM665. An analyst at Robert Fleming in London expects Deutsche to report
the worst results of the big three banks in spite of curbing its lending
growth. Dresdner Bank lost DM1.50 to DM352.50 ahead of its results, due on
Monday.
PARIS eased as several leading stocks came under pressure. The CAC-40 index
ended 17.75 down at 1,781.68 but was 1.8 per cent higher on the week.
Turnover slipped back to FFr2.2bn.
Carrefour ended FFr135 or 5.5 per cent lower at FFr2,303 after the
supermarket group announced a fall in November sales which put its full-year
forecasts into doubt.
LVMH dropped FFr119 or 3.1 per cent to FFr3,690 on reports that a London
broker had downgraded its forecast for Guinness, with which it has a
cross-shareholding.
Lafarge fell as low as FFr309.10 on rumours, later denied by the company,
that it was considering an issue of dollar-denominated convertible bonds.
The shares recovered to close down FFr9 at FFr317.
Elsewhere, Peugeot was knocked back in late trading to close FFr15 or 2.8
per cent down at FFr523.
MILAN fell on position-squaring ahead of the long weekend. The market is
closed on Tuesday for a national holiday and although it is open on Monday,
many players are expected to be absent. The Comit index fell 2.91 to 423.55,
down 4.3 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at less than Thursday's
L252.7bn.
A resurgence of rumours that it was to be sold spurred Rinascente up by L453
or 6.7 per cent to L7,185. Trading in the privatisation stock Credito
Italiano was also lively, adding L42 or 1.5 per cent to L2,770.
The hotel group Ciga rebounded by L122 or 13.6 per cent to L1,020 after its
sharp fall earlier this week. But Ciga's majority shareholder, Fimpar, owned
by the Aga Khan, finally settled at L455, down L93 or 17 per cent, after
being delayed from trading because of excessive declines.
Generali, which announced that premium income rose 13.4 per cent in the
first nine months of 1992, fell L280 to L27,460.
AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index closed unchanged at 105.6 but was down 2.3
per cent on the week.
Daf remained in the limelight after Thursday's news of further restructuring
measures, but its shares were unchanged at Fl 6.20 as analysts took the view
that the group's fight for survival was still in the balance.
Amev and ING lost Fl 1.90 and 20 cents respectively to Fl 60.40 and Fl 49.40
after publication of their nine-month results on Thursday.
MADRID firmed slightly ahead of the weekend as the general index gained 0.74
to 212.14, a rise of 1.4 per cent on the week. News that Grupo Torras, the
Spanish holding company of the KIO, was filing for receivership weighed on
affiliated industrial companies, including Ebro which shed Pta105 or 10 per
cent to Pta860.
Repsol firmed Pta50 at Pta2,625 as investors decided that it might not be
liable for clean-up costs linked to the spillage of crude oil into the sea
off northern Spain after a tanker it had chartered ran aground on Thursday.
STOCKHOLM dropped 2.1 per cent in a continued downward correction to its
post-devaluation rally. The Affarsvarlden general index ended 18.2 lower at
864.4, down 2.3 per cent on the week, in turnover of SKr727m.
Trading focused on the ball-bearings group SKF after rumours that Incentive
would acquire SKF. Turnover in SKF shares was usually heavy at SKr102m with
the B shares closing unchanged at SKr80.
ZURICH firmed slightly ahead of Sunday's referendum on Switzerland's
membership of the EEA. The SMI index added 6.4 to 1,935.0, up 1.1 per cent
on the week.
ISTANBUL's 75-share index closed down 30.33 at 3,891.55 despite a decline in
November inflation.
