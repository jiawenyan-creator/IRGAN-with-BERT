ARMY WON'T ASK GAY MAN TO REPAY HIS SCHOLARSHIP 
The Army will not force a gay man expelled from the Reserve Officers' Training 
Corps to repay a $25,000 scholarship, but it denied his request to be 
commissioned and serve in the military, his lawyer said Friday. The Army said 
its decision was based "solely on the merits and circumstances of this 
particular case."
