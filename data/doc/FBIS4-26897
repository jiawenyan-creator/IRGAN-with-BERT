  [Text] Shenzhen 27 June (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- 
Shenzhen's inflation this year does not allow optimism, Shao 
Hanqing, member of the Shenzhen City CPC Committee Standing 
Committee and concurrently director of the propaganda 
department, stated here today. 
  According to Shao Hanqing, between January and May this 
year, 
the general consumer price index for Shenzhen residents went up 
by 18.1 percent over the same period last year; in May, it went 
up by 16.2 percent over the same period last year. Compared 
with the other 35 large- and medium cities in China, Shenzhen's 
inflation rate is comparatively low; however, the retail price 
index in May went up by 15.3 percent over the same period last 
year. In addition, Shenzhen's original price index base led the 
whole country, and the present inflation rate has aroused 
residents' resentment somewhat. 
  Shao Hanqing said that because the price issue involves 
every 
household, the Shenzhen City government will adopt a series of 
measures while doing its best to keep prices controlled at a 
rational level. The measures include, first, strictly 
controlling the presentation of various price-regulating items 
and readjusting prices for 36 categories of goods listed as 
being under the control of price administrations at various 
levels, while price-regulating plans which can be halted should 
not be presented, and those that can be postponed will be 
presented as late as possible. Second, strictly monitoring 
prices of people's daily necessities and service items; Shenzhen 
will monitor prices for some 20 items, including rice, to insure 
stable prices for people's daily necessities and services. 
Third, implement the system of attaching explicit price tags to 
all commodities and price lists for services. And fourth, do a 
good job of the great examination of market prices; crack down 
on lawbreakers who practice cheating, monopolizing the market to 
jack up prices, and forced purchases or marketing; and ban 
unlicensed peddling and the practice of arbitrarily setting up 
stalls to sell things.
