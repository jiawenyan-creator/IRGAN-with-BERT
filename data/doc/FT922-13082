FT  14 APR 92 / Brussels to launch Pounds 609m programme to boost HDTV
THE European Commission is today expected to approve an Ecu850m (Pounds
609m) action plan to encourage European wide-screen television services, the
first step towards full high-definition television (HDTV).
Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the telecommunications commissioner, and Mr Jean
Dondelinger, responsible for audiovisual affairs, aim to persuade
commissioners that broadcasters, satellite operators and manufacturers need
financial incentives if they are to back wide-screen television.
Final approval of the five-year financial package will be up to member
states. Telecommunications ministers have already decided on a liberal
strategy to meet the challenge of US and Japanese competition.
Last year they agreed on a compulsory EC transmission standard for new
satellite TV services - tied to a wide-screen format - but safeguarded
existing services broadcast in other standards.
About a quarter of the Ecu850m incentive money would be earmarked for
programme-makers, and the rest would help develop the technology.
Officials said the cash would not involve direct manufacturing subsidies,
and would be weighted towards the beginning of the five-year period.
The Commission and industry representatives are still negotiating a parallel
industrial strategy, based on a legally-binding memorandum of understanding.
