  [Text] Two more Parti Bersatu Sabah [Sabah United Party, 
PBS] state assemblymen today quit the party which has now lost 
its majority in the state legislative assembly. Deputy Chief 
Minister Datuk Chau Tet Onn and the assemblyman for Sembulan, 
Encik [Mr.] Chau Chin Tang, who announced their resignations 
from the PBS at a press conference at the Istana Hotel in Kuala 
Lumpur, said they will join Barisan Nasional [National Front, 
BN]. 
  Chau, the assemblyman for Api-Api, said he was joining the 
Liberal Democratic Party, LDP, a component of the BN. 
  They were the latest two defections of the three-week old 
PBS 
state government led by Chief Minister Datuk Joseph Pairin 
Kitingan, who lost its majority in the state assembly made up of 
48 elected representatives and six nominated assemblymen. 
  The defections of PBS assemblymen since Saturday reduced the 
PBS majority of 25 elected representatives and six nominated 
assemblymen to 24 seats -- five of them nominated members 
compared with 40 for BN. 
  The PBS, which won 25 seats in the state election on 18 and 
19 of last month giving it a simple majority, formed the new 
government on the 22d and appointed six more assemblymen as 
provided for under the state constitution. 
  Meanwhile, Datuk Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan has confirmed that he 
will lead the newly formed Parti Bersatu Rakyat Sabah [United 
Sabah People's Party] and which is to be launched in Kota 
Kinabalu today. He told newsmen before leaving Kuala Lumpur for 
Kota Kinabalu that the new party will be a multi-racial party 
and will apply to join the Barisan Nasional. Datuk Dr. Jeffrey 
will explain to the people of Sabah as to why he is taking such 
a move. He will also brief his brother, Datuk Joseph Pairin 
Kitingan, of his intention to leave PBS and join the new party.
