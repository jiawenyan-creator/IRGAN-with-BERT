ALL-STAR TEAM COLLECTS 15 HITS IN 13-10 VICTORY 
A team of Ventura County all-star baseball players outslugged a similar team 
from the Westside, 13-10, Sunday at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
Ventura County had 15 hits, including three by Buena's Tom Lunsford, who hit a 
two-run home run in the first inning and finished with four runs batted in. Rio 
Mesa's Steve Soliz delivered a key blow in the fifth inning, blasting a 
three-run double to give Ventura County a 6-4 lead. 
Ventura County snapped a 7-7 tie with six runs in the eighth. Lunsford, Simi 
Valley's Terry Hill and Jesse Anguiano, Royal's Jason Jones and Westlake's 
Derek Tamburro each had run-scoring singles in the inning. 
Five Ventura County pitchers issued 14 walks, but Camarillo's Steve Biggs went 
the final 2 2/3 innings to earn the victory. Biggs was also the winning pitcher 
last week for the South in the Ventura County All-Star game. 
With the bases loaded and one out in the third, Rio Mesa's Jon Rust replaced 
starter Rich Langford of Simi Valley and struck out two batters in a row. 
Jones, the center fielder, made several fine defensive plays.
