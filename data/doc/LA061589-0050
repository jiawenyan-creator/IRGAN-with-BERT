The National Aeronautics and Space Administration unveiled a revised shuttle 
launch schedule, formally pushing the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope into 
1990 and cutting the 1989 flight schedule by one mission. As expected, the new 
shuttle schedule lists six flights in 1989, nine flights in 1990, eight in 
1991, 12 in 1992, including the first flight of the new shuttle Endeavour, and 
14 in 1993.
