FT  06 OCT 92 / Consumer credit advances fall again
NEW CREDIT advanced to consumers by finance houses, building societies and
credit cards in the Visa or Mastercard system totalled Pounds 3.82bn in
August compared with Pounds 4.25bn in July, the Central Statistical Office
reported yesterday. The August figure was one of the lowest of the year.
The figures showed that consumers avoided buying goods on credit in August,
preferring instead to pay back their debts.
The latest official credit business figures show that consumers repaid a net
Pounds 30m in August, undermining hopes of a slight high street recovery. In
July there was a net increase in credit of Pounds 78m.
The seasonally adjusted figures also showed a sharp fall in demand for
credit in the three months to the end of August. Consumers repaid a net
Pounds 7m after increasing borrowings by Pounds 109m in the three months to
the end of May.
Although the figures represent only about 15 per cent of total
private-sector debt - they do not include mortgages - they provide a useful
snapshot of consumer activity.
August's Pounds 30m repayment of consumer credit compares with net
borrowings of Pounds 226m in August 1990, and Pounds 13m in August last
year, reflecting the priority consumers have attached to repaying debts
since the recession began.
In August, net lending on credit cards increased by Pounds 3m against July's
increase of Pounds 29m. Lending on credit cards slowed over the three months
to the end of August, growing by only Pounds 30m compared with Pounds 248m
in the three months to the end of May.
According to the CSO, there was Pounds 29.76bn of credit outstanding at the
end of August compared with Pounds 29.85bn at the end of July.
