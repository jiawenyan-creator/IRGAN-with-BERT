  [Text] Tiraspol, 17 Jan -- The press service of the Russian 
14th Army issued a statement today condemning attempts to set 
the population of the Dniester Republic against servicemen. 
Someone thinks it very important to drive a wedge between the 
Army and the population, to make the Army a scapegoat for all 
evils, and thereby to divert public attention from the 
sociopolitical problems that really do exist in the Dniester 
Republic, the statement says. 
  Explaining this statement to the ITAR-TASS correspondent, 
General Lebed, commander of the 14th Army, pointed to 
unscrupulous articles in a number of newspapers, in particular 
PRAVDA, alleging that the Army had been put on combat alert and 
was preparing an assault on the Dniester Republic government.
