  [Text] A ceremony was held today at the premiership 
headquarters at which the former head of government, Redha 
Malek, handed over his duties to the new prime minister, Mokdad 
Sifi. Nacira Ait Salah reports: 
  [Salah] Following his appointment as head of government, the 
takeover ceremony between Redha Malek and Mokdad Sifi, the new 
head of government, took place this evening: 
  [Begin Malek recording] We have carried out our duty in 
total 
faithfulness and sincerity to the nation and to the great 
Algerian people. I wish the new head of government, brother 
Sifi, all success in his noble and difficult task. I wish 
progress and prosperity to the proud Algerian people. [end 
recording] 
  [Salah] The new head of government promised that the new 
government will be formed as soon as possible and that the 
government reshuffle will not be a radical one. On the 
contrary, some ministers will keep their portfolios. [passage 
indistinct] 
  [Begin Sifi recording] I will endeavor to see this take 
place 
as soon as possible, God willing. However, anything that is 
useful requires time. I will exert efforts on the ground to see 
this happen as soon possible, God willing. [end recording]
