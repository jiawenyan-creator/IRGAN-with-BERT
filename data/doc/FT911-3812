FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Kao hit by overseas operations
KAO, the Japanese toiletries maker, last year suffered losses in its
overseas operations which virtually wiped out the increase in profits made
inside Japan.
The group yesterday posted a rise in consolidated pre-tax profits for the
year to March of just 0.4 per cent to Y38bn (Dollars 274m), compared with an
increase of 3.4 per cent to Y40.1bn at the parent company. The parent
company accounts for the bulk of Kao's operations within Japan. Six
subsidiaries, including the US business, made losses.
The parent company saw sales rise 4.5 per cent to Y570bn. Growth was held
back by intense competition in the market for household detergents, where
Kao's highly-successful Attack has spawned imitators. Also, Kao made little
new headway in hygiene products, including disposable nappies, where it
launched New Merries. On a consolidated basis, sales were up 6.7 per cent at
Y662bn.
For the current year, Kao forecasts parent company sales of Y585bn, an
increase of 2.6 per cent, and pre-tax profits of Y42bn, up 3.4 per cent. Kao
said it hoped for increases in sales and profits despite a slow-down in the
Japanese economy. It said that because the domestic market for household
products was mature it was pouring its energies into developing new markets.
