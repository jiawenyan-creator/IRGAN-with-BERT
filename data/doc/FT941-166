FT  31 MAR 94 / Hercules grounded by labour on urinals
Significant structural repairs were needed to the RAF's 61 Hercules C-130
transport aircraft because of corrosion caused by leakage around urinals,
the Commons defence committee said yesterday.
'Spending a penny correctly would have saved tens of thousands of pounds,'
said the committee in a report on the programme to refurbish or replace the
Hercules fleet.
The MPs said they were deeply concerned that a relatively simple factor such
as leakage around urinals could lead to significant structural repairs - a
glassfibre shield has been recommended to protect the aircraft.
They also expressed dismay that wings that had already been replaced on the
1960s-built aircraft needed to be refurbished or replaced again.
Almost half the fleet is out of action at any one time because of corrosion
and ageing. The cross-party committee said this was 'unacceptable'.
Lockheed of the US has submitted a tender to replace part of the fleet with
the new Hercules C-130J. British Aerospace is urging refurbishment until the
European Future Large Aircraft (FLA) is available next century. The MPs
ruled out refurbishment and urged the MoD to replace half its fleet with the
C-130J by the year 2000. But when the remainder of the fleet is replaced,
the committee recommended buying a larger aircraft such as the FLA.
