FT  26 MAR 92 / Italy's public-sector deficit set to go higher than forecast
The Italian public-sector deficit could reach L160,000bn (Pounds 74.4bn)
this year instead of the L128,000bn targeted in the 1992 budget, Robert
Graham reports from Rome.
This was confirmed yesterday by Mr Guido Carli, treasury minister, in the
concluding remarks of the treasury's accounts for 1991. Ministers in the
outgoing Christian Democrat-led government of Mr Giulio Andreotti see the
need for an early mini-budget to correct Italy's deteriorating public
finances. But the timing is complicated by the April 5 general elections and
expected delays in forming a new coalition.
The blame for the increased deficit is being put on a mix of higher spending
and lower fiscal receipts.
Higher spending largely reflects the extra cost of servicing Italy's
L1,450,000bn debt as a result of higher interest rates.
