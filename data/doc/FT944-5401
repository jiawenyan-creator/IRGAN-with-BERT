FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): Tax threat - Life assurance
THE MEASURE: New rules to be introduced in May 1996 may tax the regular
'income' withdrawals from certain life assurance policies, writes Debbie
Harrison.
WHAT IT MEANS: The proposed change could take the gloss off these products
for higher-rate taxpayers.
Under certain life assurance savings plans, the fund, not the individual,
pays tax that is broadly equivalent to the basic rate on both income and
capital gains. Investors can withdraw up to 5 per cent of the value of the
original capital each year. For those on the basic tax rate, there is no
extra to pay, while higher-rate taxpayers can defer any further liability
until the plan matures.
Michael Bryant, marketing director of Rathbone Brothers, a private client
banking and asset management group, says: 'If these withdrawals are taxed in
the hands of the individual, the tax advantages will disappear for
higher-ratepayers.'
Angus Jones, account manager with stockbroker Capel Cure Myers, adds: 'These
policies have been oversold by insurance companies, which have told
prospective clients (including basic-rate taxpayers) that there is a 5 per
cent per annum tax-free withdrawal facility. 'This is blatantly not true
because the fund has already been taxed internally at 25 per cent.'
