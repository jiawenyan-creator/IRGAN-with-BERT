  [Text] Chisinau 1 June TASS -- Moldavian [Moldovan] 
President Mircea Snegur welcomed on Wednesday Turkish President 
Suleyman Demirel's pledge of assistance to the Gagauz, a 
Turkish-speaking minority in Moldavia. 
  Snegur stressed that the Gagauz have broad rights in the 
republic. There are 49 Gagauz schools, a college and a 
university in areas predominantly inhabited by the Gagauz. 
There are also Gagauz radio and television programmes in 
Moldavia. 
  However, he pointed out that these areas need economic 
assistance to support economic reform, which, he said, have 
become irreversible. 
  Demirel confirmed during his talks with Snegur earlier today 
that Turkey is ready to provide economic and other assistance to 
the Gagauz people and help Moldavia sell its products in the 
world market. 
  Speaking about prospects for setting up an economic union of 
the Black Sea countries, the Turkish president said such a union 
would provide a new scheme of economic relations in the world. 
  Snegur praised Turkey for support, saying it was one of the 
first to have recognised Moldavia's independence and called for 
broader economic ties between the two countries. 
  "The treaty of friendship and cooperation which is being 
prepared now will give a new impetus to cooperation between our 
countries," he said.
