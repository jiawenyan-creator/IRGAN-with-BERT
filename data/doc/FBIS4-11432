  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 27 Apr (EFE) -- Today, the Haitian 
Army Staff justified the killing of more than 20 people on the 
evening of 22 April by soldiers and members of the Revolutionary 
Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti (FRAPH) in 
Raboteau neighborhood, Gonaives. 
  In a news release, the Armed Forces High Command said the 
killings in Raboteau resulted from an alleged act of 
destabilization plotted by supporters of President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, who was toppled by the military on 30 September 1991. 
According to the Army, this destabilization plot was part of an 
alleged scheme concocted by Washington on 21 November 1993 at a 
meeting attended by members of the government of Prime Minister 
Robert Malval and President Aristide.
