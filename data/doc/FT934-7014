FT  22 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong
For a stock market which has risen 70 per cent this year, Hong Kong is not
easily unsettled. Morgan Stanley's advice that its clients should scale back
exposure to Hong Kong equities might have been expected to jangle nerves.
The flight of US institutional investors from low interest rates at home has
contributed heavily to the market's remarkable run. With shares trading on a
multiple of around 15 times next year's forecast earnings - against a normal
trading range of up to 12.5 times - it is hard to quibble with the judgment
that the Hang Seng index is fully valued.
But the US is not the market's only source of liquidity. Japanese investors
have joined the buying party since the summer. With the local economy
booming, Hong Kong itself is hardly strapped for cash. Anecdotal evidence
suggests local investors have pulled back from the more extravagantly-priced
stocks. Some of that cash is likely to be reinvested, perhaps in second-line
shares. That should provide support even if US investors now temper their
enthusiasm.
Still, Hong Kong will find it more difficult to shrug off bad news from here
on. China remains both an enticing prospect and a possible source of nasty
shocks, both political and economic. While Beijing's credit squeeze now
appears to be easing, that may only postpone the day when resolute action is
required to curb an over-heating economy.
