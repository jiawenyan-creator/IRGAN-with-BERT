FT  30 NOV 93 / Eta row blocks asylum progress
Hopes that the European Union would speed up its faltering steps towards a
common policy on asylum for non-EU nationals were blocked by a row about
asylum for alleged Basque terrorists in Belgium.
Spain placed a general reserve on nine pieces of the asylum policy jigsaw.
It argued angrily that Belgium's decision to consider two wanted members of
the Basque separatist organisation Eta as possibly eligible for refugee
status meant there was insufficient confidence between member states in each
other's judicial institutions to proceed to a broader common policy.
The two suspects are wanted on suspicion of providing infrastructure for a
separatist commando unit. They were arrested in Brussels in June, but
lawyers acting for them have applied to Belgium's commissioner for refugees,
who is independent of the government and has yet to pronounce.
The Dutch were also unable to agree on the asylum proposals, because almost
alone among member states, they are obliged to inform their national
parliament on the secretive deliberations of EU interior ministers.
Justice ministers, meeting for the first time yesterday as a formal EU
council of ministers following the entry into force of the Maastricht
treaty, did agree to seek a common approach to extradition which would
effectively rule out any future political defence for criminal action inside
the EU. But, for the moment, 11 member states are signed up to a separate
Council of Europe convention which does allow for 'political infractions';
the exception, ironically, is Belgium, which can not sign the convention
because it retains the death penalty, although without applying it.
Ministers got further entangled yesterday when Spain also placed a reserve
on setting up Europol, the EU criminal intelligence unit which last month's
summit of the 12 heads of government agreed to locate in The Hague.
