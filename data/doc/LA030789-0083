U.S. District Judge John Sprizzo in Manhattan granted defense motions to drop 
conspiracy charges against seven of the 14 defendants in the "Pizza Connection 
II" drug conspiracy trial. His ruling meant five of the defendants walked free, 
while other charges remained against the two others. The defendants were 
accused of participating in an international ring smuggling heroin and cocaine 
that was tied to the 1987 "Pizza Connection" trial that convicted 17 of 18 
defendants, all members or associates of the Mafia in the United States and 
Italy. The judge said he took the action against defendants who were not aware 
of what others were doing in the alleged ring.
