DEMOCRATS IN SENATE SNUB PRESIDENT'S CLEAN AIR BILL 
President Bush's clean air bill was introduced in the Senate today with just 
three Democratic co-sponsors, and an Administration official blamed Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell for the lack of bipartisanship. 
The three Democrats joined 21 Republican sponsors after the Administration 
conducted a vigorous recruitment drive among Democrats. 
A source at the Environmental Protection Agency, speaking only on the condition 
he not be named, said agency Administrator William K. Reilly became so upset 
with Democratic attacks on the bill that he called Mitchell to complain. 
Mitchell of Maine, the chief sponsor of past clean air legislation that failed 
to pass, said July 25 that the Bush bill "avoided virtually every tough choice" 
in forcing cities and industries to clean the nation's skies. 
Patrick Quinn, the EPA's congressional liaison, called the paucity of Senate 
Democratic sponsors "a reflection of unexpected partisan tactics by the 
majority leader's office. We made the same kind of effort (to line up sponsors) 
as we did in the House," where 57 Democrats and 90 Republicans backed the 
legislation. "It's a rather shocking disparity. Reilly feels that's very 
unfortunate and wants to avoid any partisanship in the debate." 
The EPA source said Reilly, in his call to Mitchell, made a similar point, 
stressing he "does not want to get off to a partisan start in the clean air 
debate. Mitchell said he had real concerns about (Administration proposals) on 
ozone and toxic (chemicals) and auto emissions." 
The Democrats who backed the bill were Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, John 
B. Breaux of Louisiana and J. James Exon of Nebraska.
