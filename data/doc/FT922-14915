FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Poster battles - Ballot Box
According to Concord Posterlink, the UK's largest specialist outdoor buying
agency, Labour has been using 2,200 poster sites nationwide. The Tories are
dominating with 4,500 sites, and the Liberal Democrats a poor third with
about 500.
In Scotland, the Scottish National party has occupied only 110 sites, but
the other parties have increased their blitz. Of some 3,000 hoardings, more
than 1,000 now display political advertising. Who says the SNP hasn't got
the others running scared?
