METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HARRY REEMS GUILTY OF U.S. TAX CHARGE 
The star of "Deep Throat" and hundreds of other X-rated movies pleaded guilty 
in Los Angeles on Monday to failing to file his 1982 federal tax return. 
Herbert Streicher, who is better known by his stage name Harry Reems, was 
indicted in June on charges he did not file income tax returns for 1982, 1984 
and 1985. The 1984 and 1985 charges were dropped in exchange for his guilty 
plea. 
Streicher, 42, faces a maximum prison term of one year and a $25,000 fine when 
he is sentenced Nov. 13. 
The former sex film star acknowledged not reporting more than $80,000 income 
from his appearance in such films as "Society Affairs" and "Sometimes Sweet 
Susan" to Harry Reems Productions, and transferring $33,000 of that income to 
his personal account, also without reporting it to the Internal Revenue 
Service.
