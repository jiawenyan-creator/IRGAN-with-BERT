FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Return to profit for Norske Skog
Norske Skog, one of Scandinavia's biggest pulp and paper producers,
announced a return to profit in 1993, helped by a successful cost-cutting
programme and despite lower prices for the Norwegian group's main products.
The group achieved a pre-tax profit of NKr4m (Dollars 536,800) in 1993
against a pre-tax loss of NKr662m the previous year, due to increased
production and lower finance costs.
The board proposed a dividend of NKr1 for 1993, after passing the payout in
1992, and forecast higher profits for 1994 in spite of expected higher
financial items.
Last year revenue fell by NKr219m to NKr7.34bn due to lower prices for
sulphate pulp, printing paper and building materials, which had also caused
a decline in revenue of NKr2.2bn between 1990 and 1993. Increased volume
compensated for lower prices.
The group achieved an operating profit of NKr299m in 1993, against a loss of
NKr47m in 1992 when restructuring costs of NKr200m were charged against
accounts.
Norske Skog said that it met its goal to cut costs by NKr700m between
1991-93.
