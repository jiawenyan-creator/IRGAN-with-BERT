FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF down at FFr31m
Thomson-CSF, the state- controlled French defence electronics company,
yesterday revealed the cost of its 21.5 per cent stake in Credit Lyonnais,
the troubled state bank, by announcing that its first-half net profits had
plunged to FFr31m (Dollars 5.86m) from FFr455m a year earlier.
The company said net profits from its own industrial activities had
increased by 11 per cent to FFr756m in the first half of this year, compared
with FFr680m in the same period of last year.
But this was almost entirely wiped out by the effect of the company's stake
in Credit Lyonnais and its obligation to assume an equivalent proportion of
the bank's FFr4.5bn first-half loss.
Thomson-CSF's turnover rose to FFr16.1bn, up 15 per cent from a year earlier
due mainly to acquisitions. Operating profits dropped slightly to FFr868m
from FFr918m, which the company said was the effect of consolidating more
activities.
At June 30, its order book represented 24 months of sales totalling
FFr65.5bn, against 20 months of sales worth FFr61.3bn at December 31 1993.
SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor joint venture in which
Thomson-CSF has a stake, brought in Thomson-CSF FFr227m, or double the
amount a year earlier.
The company predicted little change in operating results for the second half
of the year, but acknowledged that its overall profit position was largely
dependent on developments at Credit Lyonnais.
However, it took consolation from the fact that as a result of this summer's
injection of capital into the bank - to which Thomson SA, the holding
company, contributed, but its electronics subsidiary did not - Thomson CSF's
stake in Credit Lyonnais has shrunk slightly to 18.9 per cent.
