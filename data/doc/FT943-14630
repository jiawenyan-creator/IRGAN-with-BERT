FT  13 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Sao Paulo down 2.27%
Equities in Sao Paulo fell sharply in the last half hour of trade to end off
2.27 per cent on speculative selling, correcting slightly from a 13 per cent
rise posted since the July 1 introduction of the new real currency.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares ended down 911 at 39,198
points.
A major market player bid Telebras TEL. SA preferred at 42.70 reais just
half an hour before the close. But it closed at 41.40 reais, off 1.6 per
cent.
'We noticed a lot of speculators selling stocks in late trade after the
market pared its morning losses,' one broker said. 'That's the best
explanation, because domestic political and economic news were all bullish
today.'
Brokers also said they were upbeat after the central bank trimmed nominal
interest rates at its weekly bond auction to around 8.090 per cent a month.
Mexico
Mexican equities shares closed down as investors kept to the sidelines on
nervousness ahead of the August 21 presidential election, traders said. The
IPC index of 37 top shares retreated 3.72 points, a fall of 0.16 per cent,
at 2,288.28.
