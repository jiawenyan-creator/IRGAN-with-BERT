  [Text] A mission by IMF experts and the Russian Federation 
Finance Ministry are close to starting a negotiating process to 
coordinate Russia's state budget for 1994. This was announced 
by a high-ranking source at the Finance Ministry. He noted that 
a list of members at the Russian delegation to talks with IMF 
experts has been prepared and will apparently be approved in the 
near future. It includes representatives of the Finance 
Ministry, the Economy Ministry, the Foreign Economic Relations 
Ministry, and the Russian Federation Central Bank. The IMF 
mission will report the results of the meetings and talks to the 
IMF administrative council, which is expected to decide on the 
second tranche of the $1.5 billion credit to Russia.
