NATION; 
FLA. GOVERNOR TO CALL LEGISLATURE BACK TO ENACT ABORTION RESTRICTIONS 
Gov. Bob Martinez announced today that he will call a special legislative 
session to take advantage of the U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing states to 
place more restrictions on abortions. 
The special session will come no later than a previously scheduled legislative 
meeting in October to consider transportation and growth management issues and 
could be sooner, Martinez, a Republican, said. 
Before the ruling, state House Speaker Tom Gustafson had said abortion should 
be dealt with in a special session so that it does not dominate next spring's 
regular session. 
Within hours of the high court's ruling, state Rep. Tom Banjanin filed a bill 
that would enact many of the restrictions the high court allowed.
