  [Text] Praia, 5 Apr (AFP) -- The Governments of Cape Verde 
and South Africa today decided to establish diplomatic 
relations, the Cape Verdian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
disclosed today in a communique issued in Praia. The Cape 
Verdian Government's decision comes only a few days before the 
first multiracial elections in South Africa. Two Cape Verdian 
observers -- who will form part of the international observer 
team that will supervise the polls -- are already in South 
Africa at the request of the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on Apartheid. 
Trade links have already been in existence for the past several 
years between the two countries. Such links notably take the 
form of landing rights for technical stopovers at the Sal 
Airport by aircraft of the South African Airways.
