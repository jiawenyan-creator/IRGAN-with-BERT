FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Frost increases 33% and plans further
expansion
Frost Group, the UK's largest independent petrol retailer, boosted profits
by 33 per cent for the year ended December 31 on the back of a 43 per cent
rise in turnover.
Pre-tax profits were up from Pounds 5.75m to Pounds 7.65m on turnover of
Pounds 177.2m (Pounds 124m).
Earnings per share rose from 7.7p to 9.5p. A final dividend of 2.7p (2.2p)
is proposed, giving a total of 4.9p (3.9p).
Mr John Murgatroyd, finance director, said yesterday that the company had
opened another 50 sites during the year, taking the group total to 181. The
group now accounted for 1.65 per cent of UK petrol sales.
Frost, which trades as Save Service Stations, increased its market share
against a background of a 1.5 per cent fall in UK volume, and a fall of 3.1
per cent in the number of petrol stations to just under 18,000.
Last October Frost made a 5-for-1 rights issue to raise Pounds 21.3m in
order to repay bank debt and clear the way for further acquisitions. It
ended the year with cash of nearly Pounds 7m and unused existing facilities
of Pounds 21m. Net assets rose from Pounds 27m to Pounds 50.9m.
Mr Murgatroyd said the group planned a further 45 to 50 sites this year.
Frost sites its shops in towns and local communities, believing that
motorists tend to fill up at the beginning or end of their journeys. Each
site has a Smilies corner shop, selling goods ranging from coal and
grow-bags to milk and bread. The shops are open 16 hours a day, seven days a
week.
The group has also introduced a smart card which effectively knocks 2p a
gallon off the price of petrol to loyal customers.
