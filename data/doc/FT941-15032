FT  18 JAN 94 / Gift-giving fails to lift store sales
The year-end gift giving season has failed to stimulate sluggish Japanese
consumer spending, according to the latest figures from Tokyo department
stores, writes William Dawkins.
Sales at the 27 stores in and around the Japanese capital fell by 7.6 per
cent in December, against the same month last year, the 22nd monthly fall in
a row, the Japan department store association reported yesterday.
That brought Tokyo stores' total annual sales to Y2,510bn (Pounds 15.1bn),
down 9.6 per cent on 1992. A drop in traditional corporate year-end gift
giving contributed to the December sales decline, but the general trend
testifies to consumers' continued gloom at a time when the outlook for wages
and jobs is poor.
The gap between workers and employers is far wider than usual as the annual
spring wage round nears. The Nikkeiren employers' federation argues that
companies must freeze wages to preserve jobs, but the Rengo national trade
union federation argues that a rise of at least 5 per cent is needed to pull
the economy out of recession.
