LAWBREAKERS TOLD TO MIND THEIR KNITTING 
Needles are the newest criminal sentence in Marquette County. 
A few people convicted of misdemeanors have been handed knitting needles and 
told to knit and purl away their debts to society. 
"I tell them this is a way to help make up (for their offenses)," District 
Judge Patricia Micklow said. 
Using yarn donated by a church, six offenders are knitting afghans, hats, 
scarfs, mittens and such for the needy. 
"These are things I can use any time," said Sister Johnice Borer, a Franciscan 
nun with the Marquette Catholic Diocese Outreach office, which distributes the 
knitted goods to the poor.
