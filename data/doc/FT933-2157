FT  21 SEP 93 / Employers seek more flexibility
THE European employers body, Unice, yesterday accepted the inevitability of
European Community legislation on employee consultation and pressed for
greater flexibility than contained in the existing works council directive.
The works councils for employee consultation could be one of the first
directives to be pushed through the social chapter mechanism of the
Maastricht treaty, which excludes the UK.
The directive will require up to 1,200 multinationals operating in the EC to
convene works councils at least once a year.
Yesterday Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, secretary-general of Unice, said the
social partners - unions and employers - should work together with the EC
Commission to find an acceptable alternative to the current draft directive.
He said: 'Unice is ready to sit down with the Commission and European unions
to develop a positive and constructive procedure that is acceptable to all
parties.'
