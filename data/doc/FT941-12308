FT  31 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Banking
A neat coincidence of timing brings Spain's government-sponsored rescue of
Banesto at precisely the moment that Continental Bank, salvaged by a
comparable US effort in 1984, disappears into the arms of BankAmerica.
Since Banesto is also likely to be swallowed up, one lesson is that a fight
for survival, even one as successful as Continental's, damages a bank's
chances of remaining independent.
There is another lesson, too. Both Continental and BankAmerica came through
their difficulties of the 1980s by focusing on the things they did best -
nationwide corporate banking in Continental's case, regional retail banking
at BankAmerica.
In principle, the two together make a stronger, more diversified bank than
either alone. In practice, unusual management determination may be needed to
avoid a consequent loss of focus. And the knock-down price in relation to
assets at which BankAmerica is acquiring Continental reflects the market's
misgivings about the long-term profitability of wholesale banking.
Banesto should have such problems. Despite JP Morgan's cajoling, the old
management had not steeled itself to settle for doing a few things well. The
new managers probably have the inclination but they may not have the time;
the rescue plan seems set to hand control to a rival in a matter of months.
Selling the deposit guarantee scheme's stake so promptly risks crystallising
losses at the low point of the bank's fortunes. Banesto shareholders,
diluted by 75 per cent, may not be happy, but all Spanish bank depositors
are likely to be losers, too.
