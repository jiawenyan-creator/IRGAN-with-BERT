  [Excerpt] The First Special Congress of the Sandinist 
National Liberation Front [FSLN] will be held on 20 May 1994. 
The agenda includes issues that are essential to the existence 
of the FSLN and points in three directions: reform of the 
statutes, reform of the program, and election of authorities. 
  Prior to the congress and starting in January 1994, the 
organizing commission -- headed by FSLN founder Tomas Borge 
Martinez -- will make an intense effort in all the country's 
departments to ensure the participation of the Sandinist 
delegates and members in the preparatory debates. [passage
