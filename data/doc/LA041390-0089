METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEARING SET IN STANDOFF AT HOME OF SHARON 
GLESS 
A preliminary hearing will be held April 25 for a woman prosecutors describe as 
an obsessed fan who broke into the Studio City home of actress Sharon Gless 
while armed with a rifle and 500 rounds of ammunition. 
The hearing was scheduled Thursday for Joni Leigh Penn, 30, who pleaded not 
guilty on April 9. 
Penn is charged with two counts of residential burglary to commit theft. Both 
charges included firearms allegations. 
If convicted on both counts, Penn could face 10 years in prison. She was being 
held without bail. 
Penn was arrested March 30 after a seven-hour standoff with police officers. 
She was armed with a .22-caliber rifle, but no shots were fired. 
Gless, who played a police detective on the "Cagney &amp; Lacey" television 
series, was not home at the time. 
In November, 1988, a judge ordered Penn to stay 200 yards away from Gless.
