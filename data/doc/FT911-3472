FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Chevron sees profits rise by 18%
in first quarter
A JUMP in Chevron's first-quarter refining and marketing income more than
offset a decline in US exploration and production, resulting in an 18 per
cent rise in net earnings for the San Francisco-based energy producer.
Earnings climbed to Dollars 557m, or Dollars 1.59 a share, from Dollars
473m, or Dollars 1.33, a year earlier. Revenues rose to Dollars 10.8bn from
Dollars 9.3bn.
Despite the sharp increase for the period as a whole, Mr Ken Derr, Chevron
chief executive, noted that earnings slid towards the end of the period as
crude oil prices settled at lower levels, US refining margins began to
erode, and prices and demand for natural gas moved down.
Refining and marketing income soared to Dollars 233m from Dollars 130m. This
year's profits would have been even higher without a Dollars 47m charge for
environmental provisions and asset write-offs.
Sales of natural gas in the US edged down to just under 3m cubic feet a day,
from 3.1mcf last year. Foreign gas output rose 8 per cent.
Income from chemicals dipped to Dollars 73m from Dollars 123m, but last
year's figure included a Dollars 59m gain from chemicals licensing
agreements. Operating earnings rose by 14 per cent.
