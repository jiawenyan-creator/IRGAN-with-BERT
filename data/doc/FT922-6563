FT  22 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries depressed after report on
interest rates
A NEWSPAPER report that Federal Reserve policy makers had decided against an
immediate cut in short-term interest rates depressed US Treasury market
prices across the maturity range yesterday.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  21/32 at 101
15/32 , yielding 7.866 per cent. Prices were even lower at the shorter end
of the range, with the seven-year note down  29/32 at 99 1/2 , yielding
7.079 per cent, and the two-year note down  7/32 at 99 9/16 , yielding 5.342
per cent.
New York trading opened weaker in the wake of a Wall Street Journal story
that Tuesday and Wednesday's meeting of the policy-making Fed Open Market
Committee had decided not to cut interest rates. Prices had risen steadily
in the past few days on hopes of a policy ease, but analysts now believe a
rate cut is unlikely until the Fed has a clearer idea of the state of the
recovery.
The day's only economic data reinforced the downward pressure on prices,
with weekly jobless claims falling 20,000 to 406,000 for the first full week
of May. In the afternoon, the Treasury's sale of Dollars 10.26bn in
five-year notes was reportedly well received at an average yield of 6.75 per
cent.
UK government bond prices retained a positive tone yesterday, encouraged by
money supply figures which showed an increase in bank lending during April.
On the London futures and options exchange, the June gilt futures contract
opened at 99.23 and moved within a tight 99.26 to 99.18 range in low trading
volumes. By the close the contract stood at 99.19. Volume was 25,000
contracts.
In the cash market, long-dated gilts pushed higher during the morning
session but settled back to close little changed on the day. For example,
the 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 opened at 101 5/16 , rose to 101 13/32 in
the day but fell back to close at 101 11/32 for a yield of 8.85 per cent.
Money supply figures for April showed bank and building society lending
rising by Pounds 5.1bn, the highest monthly total since October last year.
The figures were taken as encouraging by the market.
GERMAN government bond trading was light as the market waited for the
release of money supply data for April, which could determine the direction
of interest rates.
The benchmark 8 per cent Unity bond maturing January 2002 closed at 100.18,
from 100.38 on Wednesday, for a yield of 7.96 per cent. The price was
depressed by the announcement that the Bundesbank had added DM4bn to the
issue, which will be sold into the market when conditions are right.
On Liffe, the June bund future closed at 87.70, from an opening level of
87.74. Volume was a sluggish 35,000 contracts.
The yield spread between the French and German markets remained little
changed, at around 59 basis points at the 10-year maturity. However, the
strength of international support for the French market was yesterday
evident from the results of an auction of two-year and five-year notes. The
French treasury offered FFr12.8bn stock but received bids for over FFr50bn -
many from international investors.
SWISS government bonds lost around  1/2 a point yesterday as investors
nervously waited for the results of the federal authorities' first regular
monthly bond auction, due to be announced today.
The government is hoping to sell SFr700m of new paper, although poor market
conditions have hampered the auction which began on Monday.
At the opening yesterday, dealers were quoting the new 6 3/4 per cent 2003
bonds in the grey market at 99.20, for a yield of 6.92 per cent. By the
close the grey market price had retreated to 98.75, for a yield of 6.92 per
cent.
JAPANESE government bond prices eased slightly overnight in Tokyo, although
the market took its tone from US Treasury bonds in the absence of new
domestic factors.
The benchmark 10-year government bond issue No 129 closed on a yield of 5.49
per cent, from 5.46 per cent at the opening.
