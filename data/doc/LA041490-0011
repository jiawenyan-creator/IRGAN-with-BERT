RESIDENTS GRAPPLE WITH THE DROUGHT 
What I find most disturbing in your article on California's drought (front 
page, April 1) is that the officials at MWD seem to be surprised that we are 
running short of water. 
For years now MWD has been openly supportive of the extraordinary growth in 
Southern California as though there was an unlimited supply of water. 
Never once have they suggested that we should limit our growth to ensure that 
we have an adequate supply of water to meet future demand. Even now when they 
are on the verge of rationing water, MWD officials are still not suggesting 
that we attempt to plan California's growth. 
At our present growth rate, this year's 12% water shortage is equivalent to the 
amount of water that three years of Southern California's growth uses. After 
the 1977 drought if our water officials had recommended that we start planning 
our growth instead of just accommodating it, we would not be facing the severe 
water shortage we are today.
