'TOOZ' SUPER BOWL RINGS GO TO NEPHEWS 
Former Raider John Matuszak, who died of a drug overdose, bequeathed his Super 
Bowl rings to nephews and the majority of his estimated $450,000 estate to his 
mother and three sisters. 
The former All-Pro defensive end known for his on-the-field aggression and 
off-the-field flamboyance named his mother, Audrey Matuszak, as his executor in 
the will formally filed in Superior Court on Monday. 
In the will signed July 13, 1984, the standout player known to football fans by 
his nickname "The Tooz," left his championship ring from Super Bowl XI to a 
nephew, Justin Evancy, and his ring from Super Bowl XV to another nephew, Luke 
Evancy. 
Matuszak bequeathed the contents of his house in Franklin, Wis., to his sister, 
Christine Evancy. 
The rest of his estate, $230,000 in personal property, $217,000 in real 
property and $10,000 in income from that property, was left to his mother and 
his sisters, Karen and Dawn Matuszak. 
Matuszak, 38, died in June at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank. The 
county coroner's office determined that his death resulted from an accidental 
overdose of a narcotic pain killer, aggravated by an enlarged heart and 
pneumonia.
