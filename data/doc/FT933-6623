FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Avesta Sheffield back in black
in second quarter
AVESTA Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer, yesterday
disclosed a second-quarter profit of SKr9m (Dollars 1.12m), a strong
turnround on the SKr53m loss for the first three months.
The group attributed the better performance to improved productivity, rather
than to a market upturn. It did not provide comparative figures as it was
only formed through the merger of Avesta and British Steel Stainless last
November.
First-half sales amounted to SKr7.14bn, against SKr11.8bn for all 1992.
Operating profit after depreciation was SKr142m, compared with a SKr180m
loss for all 1992.
Lower financial expenses left the group with a loss after financial items of
SKr44m after including a negative SKr49m adjustment for changes in inventory
values.
The group said its strong position in the recovering UK and North American
markets should offset weak demand in most of Europe in the second half.
It expects to show a considerable improvement on last year's SKr564m loss.
