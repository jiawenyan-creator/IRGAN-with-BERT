FT  25 SEP 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Can BES offset my gains?
I AM embarrassed by considerable capital gains which must be realised within
the next two tax years and which will exceed, by a large amount, my annual
allowance. If I take gains which, when added to my taxable income, take me
into the 40 per cent tax bracket, can these be offset against a Business
Expansion Scheme investment, or can BES's only be used to offset tax against
income as opposed to capital gains?
BES relief is an income tax relief, and is treated like your personal
allowance, as you will see from the free pamphlet IR51 (Business Expansion
Scheme) which is obtainable from your tax office. To the extent that BES
relief reduced your total income below the basic-rate limit, of course, it
would indirectly reduce the rate of CGT on part of your capital gains.
The BES is to be abolished at the end of this calendar year, so it could not
have helped you for 1994/95 and 1995/96 in any case.
