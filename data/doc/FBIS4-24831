  [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- The ruling Kuomintang [KMT] 
is scheduled to partially reshuffle its policy-making Central 
Standing Committee in August, party sources said Wednesday [1 
Jun]. 
  The second conference of the party's Central Committee and 
Central Advisory Committee will meet on Aug. 26-27 to elect 15 
Central Committee members to fill seats in the Central Standing 
Committee, they said. The 15 currently serving Central Standing 
Committee members may be re-elected. 
  The remaining 16 Central Standing Committee members were 
appointed by the KMT's chairman, ROC [Republic of China] 
president, last year, and will serve until the next party 
congress. 
  More than 800 members of the two committees and ranking 
party 
officials will take part in the August conference, which will be 
held at Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall in downtown Taipei. The KMT 
held the first such meeting last August. 
  The conference will hear reports on political and party 
affairs, cross-strait relations and international politics.
