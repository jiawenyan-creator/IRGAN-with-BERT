FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: ABB acquires 40% interest in
Indian group
ASEA Brown Boveri, the Swiss multinational, has acquired 40 per cent of
Taylor Instrument (India), the Indian instrumentation company owned by the
Birla group.
The deal leaves the Birlas owning 41 per cent of the venture, to be called
Birla Kent Taylor Instrument. The remaining 19 per cent will be held by the
government-owned Unit Trust of India and the Life Insurance Corporation.
The Indian company, which has a turnover of Rs600m (Dollars 19m) and an
equity base of Rs15m, will use its tie-up with ABB to increase exports.
Officials say the company's turnover should touch Rs800m in the next two
years.
Century Textiles and Industries, the textiles, cement and shipping group
owned by the Birlas, reported a 28 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to
Rs1.74bn for the year ended March, 1993 on sales 9 per cent ahead at
Rs11.97bn, writes RC Murthy in Bombay.
The operations of Century Rayon, the group's synthetic fibre division, have
been partially closed following criminal charges over alleged pollution from
a plant near Bombay.
