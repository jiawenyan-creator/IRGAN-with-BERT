FT  24 NOV 94 / Tapie ordered to pay Pounds 40m
A Paris court ordered Mr Bernard Tapie and his wife to pay FFr339m (Pounds
40m) to Credit Lyonnais, the heavily loss-making state-owned bank, because
an agreement reached with them in March was no longer valid. The judgment,
by Mrs Jacqueline Cochard, president of the Tribunal de Grande Instance,
could trigger a rapid sale of assets controlled by Mr Tapie and pledged as
security against a five-year plan to repay loans believed to total about
FFr1.2bn. The Hotel de Cavoye, his luxurious mansion in Paris, could soon be
on sale, with some valuations putting its worth at FFr100m-FFr160m. His
yacht, the Phocea, which is moored in Marseilles, his company shares, and
his collection of antiques and paintings could also be sold. Mr Tapie has
said he would appeal against the ruling. It is likely that his assets are
worth less than half his debts to the bank.
