HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW IN VIDEO: 'DEAD POETS,' 'THE ABYSS' JOIN TAPE PARADE 
THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
Two very good but very different movies from last year make their video debut 
this week. 
"Dead Poets Society" (Touchstone, $89.95, PG) stars Robin Williams as an 
unconventional teacher at a private boys' school in 1959. Directed by Peter 
Weir, the funny and moving film shows -- as did "Stand and Deliver" -- how much 
difference a teacher can make when he or she is as daring as caring. 
"The Abyss" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, PG-13). You may be disappointed with the ending 
of this special-effects thriller, but chances are you'll enjoy the underwater 
trip that precedes it. Directed with dazzle by James Cameron ("The 
Terminator"). 
Other films fresh on tape: 
"The Pajama Game" (1957) and "Damn Yankees" (1958) both star Doris Day, both 
were co-directed by George Abbott and Stanley Donen, both feature exciting 
choreography by Bob Fosse, and both are colorful and lively versions of hit 
Broadway musicals. They're $59.95 each from Warner. 
"The Incredible Mr. Limpet" (1964) gave Don Knotts his strangest role (yes, 
even stranger than Barney) as a bookkeeper who turns into a, gulp, fish -- who, 
gulp again, becomes a war hero. The whimsical mix of live action and animation 
is no "Mary Poppins," but pretty charming all the same. Also $59.95 from 
Warner. 
"Chocolat" (1988, PG-13), "The Music Teacher" (1988, PG) and "Murmur of the 
Heart" (1971, R) are three notable foreign films from Orion ($79.98 each). All 
three feature easy-to-read yellow captions. 
"Night Ambush" (VidAmerica, $39.98), originally released in Britain in 1956 as 
"Ill Met By Moonlight," a taut World War II thriller, was the last film on 
which the famous "Archers" team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger worked 
together. 
"The Keys to the Kingdom" (1944), "A Man Called Peter" (1955) and "The Story of 
Ruth" all featured big Hollywood budgets and plenty of emotional 
self-sacrificing in the name of religion (Christian, of course), but not much 
else to recommend them. They're $29.98 each from CBS/Fox. 
"Fear Strikes Out" (1957) is a strong film depicting the battle baseball star 
Jimmy Piersall (Anthony Perkins) fought with mental illness. "Hell Is for 
Heroes" (1962) is a fairly decent WWII drama with Steve McQueen and Bobby 
Darin. Both are only $14.95 from Paramount. 
"Cookie" (Warner, $89.95, R) is one of the two crumby "comedies" director Susan 
Seidelman blessed us with last year (the other was "She-Devil"). This one has 
Emily Lloyd, Peter Falk, Dianne Wiest and Brenda Vaccaro in the tale of a teen 
and her racketeer father. 
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
CBS/Fox has just released four volumes containing two "Twilight Zone" episodes 
each. These are the original, b&amp;w shows from the '50s and '60s, introduced 
by Rod Serling. Each volume sells for $14.98. 
That's not all, folks. MGM/UA has some more hourlong collections of those 
fantastic Warner Bros. cartoons from the '30s and '40s: "Daffy Duck and 
Company," "Porky Pig and Company" and "Bugs Vs. Elmer." They're $14.95 each.
