FT  19 SEP 94 / World News in Brief: Pro-democracy parties lead in Hong Kong
poll
Pro-democracy parties were well ahead of pro-Beijing candidates in Hong
Kong's first fully democratic election. Nearly 700,000 people turned out to
vote, undeterred by threats from Beijing to overturn the result of the poll
when China resumes sovereignty in 1997. Chris Patten (left), the colony's
governor, said the big turnout was the mark of an 'open, self-confident and
plural society'. Picture, Page 4
