FT  17 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian disruption bumps up
hardwood pulp market
A disruption in Russian birch log supplies has contributed to an unexpected
jump in world hardwood pulp prices in recent weeks. The rise has raised
hopes among producers that the pulp market, battered by weak demand and
over-capacity for the past four years, may be on the brink of revival.
Mr Chip Dillon, analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York, said that besides
bottlenecks in pulp supplies, 'there's clearly been an improvement in paper
and pulp ordering in the past month or two'.
The price of North American hardwood kraft pulp has climbed to about Dollars
400 a tonne, from USDollars 360 a tonne at the end of November. This product
was selling at about Dollars 500 a tonne a year ago. Hardwoods account for
about a third of world pulp output of 30m tonnes a year.
Mr Richard Kellertas, analyst at McLean McCarthy in Montreal, said that
softwood pulp producers, whose output totals about 14m tonnes a year, will
probably have more difficulty raising prices, Softwood pulp mills still have
substantial over-capacity, and the outlook depends heavily on overall
business activity early next year in the US and Europe.
The interruption of Russian birch exports has forced several Finnish and
Swedish mills to cut production. One industry official estimated that
Scandinavian hardwood pulp producers are operating at only 50 to 60 per cent
of capacity.
Eucalyptus producers in Spain, Portugal and Brazil have taken advantage of
the tighter market to raise their prices. European eucalyptus prices have
jumped to about Ecu350 (Pounds 275) a tonne, from Ecu290 in mid-November.
