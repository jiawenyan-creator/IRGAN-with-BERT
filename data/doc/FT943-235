FT  30 SEP 94 / NHS boss urges pay reform caution
The National Health Service's chief executive yesterday cast doubts over the
government's plans to get health service trusts to introduce local pay deals
next spring.
Ministers have been encouraging the independent pay review bodies covering
health workers in trusts, including community and ambulance services as well
as hospitals, not to recommend a national pay increase but to leave pay to
be determined by local trusts.
But Mr Alan Langlands, chief executive of the NHS, admitted yesterday that
the national pay framework would 'not disappear overnight'.
He said what was needed was a 'pragmatic' approach to introducing local pay.
He added that the new system needed to be introduced in a 'careful and
patient and determined way'.
Mr Langlands, speaking after the NHS Trust Federation's annual conference in
Brighton, said instructions given earlier this year were not so much an
order but a signal that the government meant business.
'We don't expect everyone to achieve everything to the timetable that was
set out then,' he said.
Mr Langlands' comments are in contrast to the line set out by the Department
of Health in its evidence to the pay review body. Doctors and nurses have
reacted angrily to the proposals and vowed to fight for a national pay
award.
Unison, the public service union, has signed formal recognition agreements
with more than half of the 419 NHS trusts. In virtually every other trust it
has secured de facto recognition and is working towards formal agreements.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, Unison's general secretary, speaking at his union's
health group conference in Bournemouth, said yesterday that it had been
predicted that the advent of trusts would result in massive derecognition of
unions.
