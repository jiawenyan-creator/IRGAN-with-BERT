FT  11 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: NatWest expands with first
branch in Italy
NATIONAL Westminster Bank yesterday opened its first Italian branch, 24
hours after spending L185bn (Dollars 133m) on a hotel chain in precisely the
kind of 'structured' transaction in which the new Italian operation is to
specialise.
The new branch, bought from Continental Bank of the US, will be part of the
operations of NatWest Markets, the bank's corporate and investment banking
arm. NatWest's retail banking operations are already represented in Italy
through a 19 per cent stake in Creditwest, a small bank majority-owned by
Credito Italiano.
The new Italian operation will mirror NatWest Markets in combining
traditional lending to big companies and banks with a variety of corporate
finance and treasury skills. Its target customers will be Italy's 200
biggest banks and companies. The new office, which received branch status
from the Bank of Italy in October, will not affect NatWest's participation
in Creditwest.
Mr Martin Owen, chief executive of NatWest Markets and a board member of the
parent company, confirmed this week's purchase of 15 hotels from
AgipPetroli, which has set up a joint venture with the Forte hotels group,
was part of a wider deal.
