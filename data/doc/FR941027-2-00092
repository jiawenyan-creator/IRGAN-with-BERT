Notice is hereby given that, on August 24, 1994, pursuant to Section 6(a) of the National Cooperative Research and
Production Act of 1993, 15 U.S.C. 4301 

et seq.

 (``the Act''), TRW Inc., on behalf of members of the Precision Machining Technology Reinvestment Project (``PLM
TRP''), filed notifications simultaneously with the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission disclosing
(1) the identities of the parties to and (2) the nature and objectives of the project. The notifications were filed
for the purpose of invoking the Act's provisions limiting the recovery of antitrust plaintiffs to actual damages
under specified circumstances. Pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Act, the identities of the parties are: TRW Inc., Redondo
Beach, CA; The Boeing Company, Seattle, WA; Caterpillar Inc., Mossville, IL; Cummins Engine Company, Inc., Columbus,
IN; Edison Welding Institute, Columbus, OH; Fibertek, Inc., Herndon, VA; General Electric Aircraft Engines, Cincinnati,
OH; General Electric CRD, Schenectady, NY; Hughes Aircraft Company, Malibu, CA; the University of Illinois, Champaign,
IL; Newport News Shipbuilding, Newport News, VA; Northrup Corporation, Electronics Systems Division, Hawthorne,
CA; Penn State University, State College, PA; Process Equipment Company, Tipp City, OH; SDL, Inc., San Jose, CA; United
Technologies Corporation, East Hartford, CT; and Utilase Systems, Inc., Detroit, MI. The objective of PLM TRP is
to provide the most advanced and affordable US military systems, and the most competitive commercial products in
the global marketplace for the automotive, aerospace (platforms and propulsion systems), heavy equipment, and
shipbuilding industries through a new generation of laser machine tools and advanced laser manufacturing processes.
To accomplish this objective, a consortium of industrial laser users, process developers, system integrators,
and technology developers has been established forming a fully integrated team. This will avoid inefficient duplication
of effort and expense while performing research in this area, collection, exchange and, where appropriate, dissemination
of the research results, to work closely with various governmental and private agencies and perform further acts
allowed by the Act that would advance the PLM TRP's objectives.
Membership in PLM TRP remains open, and TRW intends to file additional written notifications disclosing all changes
in membership.
Information regarding participation in the project may be obtained from: Dr. Leonard J. Marabella, Bldg. R1/1196,
One Space Park, Redondo Beach, CA 90278.
