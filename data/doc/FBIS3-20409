  [Text] The Swedish Government today made a decision on a 
further infantry company for Bosnia. This new company will be 
stationed in Tuzla, where the Nordic UN contingent is located. 
The Swedish UN soldiers in The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia will be moved to Bosnia, if they want to, but it might 
also be a case of renewed recruiting in Sweden. With today's 
decision, the number of Swedish soldiers in Bosnia will soon be 
just over 1,000.
