Second Wind"] 
  [Text] Brief reports on the formation of a Popular 
Alliance intrigued the politicized community for several months. 
But this also is no longer a secret. 
  The constituent conference of the organizing committee of 
the 
Popular Alliance Russian patriotic movement was held recently in 
Moscow. Its "stars" include A. Golovin, S. Glazyev, D. 
Olshanskiy, and O. Rumyantsev. 
  The need for the appearance of the movement is explained by 
its organizers primarily by the fact that society's political 
requirements are going begging. A clear demonstration of this 
were the December elections in Russia, when almost half the 
electorate voted with its feet. 
  "There is no party or movement that could express the 
genuine 
interests of the people and come to power with their support. 
Today there is not, but there soon will be," D. Olshanskiy 
declared. The new political force in the shape of the Popular 
Alliance is to combine "the values of patriotism and democracy 
and the interests of the political elite and of millions of 
ordinary citizens." The formulation of such a task dictates also 
a wide spectrum of interaction with various political 
organizations. And the founders of the movement make no secret 
of the fact that it is conceived as a consolidating nucleus of 
the social-patriotic forces. 
  It is indicative that the program statement of the Popular 
Alliance was signed by many well-known figures of the Civic 
Union. V. Menshov, V. Mironenko, S. Polozkov, A. Tsipko, A. 
Chilingarov.... Centrism is gaining its second wind, it may be 
said. 
  Despite its very young age, the Popular Alliance has formed 
10 regional organizations. Their priority tasks include the 
formulation of a program with which it will take part in 
elections at all levels.
