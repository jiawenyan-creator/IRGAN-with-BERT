FT  31 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Stet plans L400bn Eurobond
offering
STET, the Italian state-controlled telecommunications holding company, is
preparing a L400bn (Dollars 335.28m) offering of Eurobonds with equity
warrants attached, the largest of its kind to date, according to market
sources.
The warrants will be exercisable into a total of around 250m savings shares
of Sip, the quoted telecommunications utility in which Stet has a 58.6 per
cent stake. The bonds are expected to carry a coupon of between 8 3/4 per
cent and 9 1/4 per cent, and the exercise price into the Sip savings shares
will be indicated at L1,456 to L1,540. The bonds will have a life of five
years and will be priced at par.
Savings shares in Sip fell L55 or 4 per cent to L1,320 yesterday, partly on
fears of earnings dilution when the warrants are exercised. However, a
banker associated with the deal said there would be no dilution as the
warrants will be exercised into shares held by Stet.
The bonds will be issued through Softe, a Luxembourg-based financial
subsidiary, and guaranteed by Stet. Officials at the lead manager
Mediobanca, the Milan-based merchant bank, were unavailable for comment.
Details of the transaction, which is not scheduled to be launched until
February 24, have not been finalised yet. Roadshows are planned ahead of the
issue and invitations to co-lead managers have already been sent out.
