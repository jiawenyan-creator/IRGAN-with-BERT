FT  18 FEB 93 / Demand from funds on costs
THE NATIONAL Association of Pension Funds is urging regulators to make fund
managers disclose full costs to their clients, Norma Cohen writes.
According to Mr Angus Matheson, chairman of the association's investment
committee, the association will soon ask Imro, the self- regulatory body for
the fund management industry, whether Imro considers the extent to which
full disclosure of fees and charges is made when deciding whether a fund
manager is 'fit and proper' to carry out investment business.
Yesterday the association, the trade body for the pensions industry,
unveiled the results of a year-long study on fees and indirect charges which
concludes that practices in the industry allow managers to profit without
their clients' knowledge.
While fund managers typically charge their clients a 'headline' fee equal to
between 0.15 and 0.25 per cent of assets under management, there are other
charges which are not easily evident, the association says. These include
additional management fees for investments in unit trusts and custody
charges.
'We found that trustees and clients did not know what their manager was up
to and their consultant could not help them,' said Mr John McLaughlan,
investment director at United Friendly Insurance and chairman of the NAPF
group that wrote the report.
