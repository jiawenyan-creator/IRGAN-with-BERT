DENTISTS 
I am writing in response to Calvin Trillin's column "A Costly Hour With Sweeney 
Todd, DDS," (Op-Ed Page, Nov. 14). 
I happen to be a retired dentist who was in active practice for many years. I 
resent the implication that all dentists are interested only in gouging their 
patients and determining the treatment on the money involved. If this article 
was written to be a comic piece, it is a failure and ends up being a vindictive 
diatribe against a dedicated group of honest and sincere professionals. 
By the way, Mr. Trillin, how much did you receive as payment for this silly 
piece? Whatever it was it was a lot more than the hourly fee of your dentist, I 
am sure, and much more than you deserve.
