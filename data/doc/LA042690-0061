EARNINGS 
Pacific Enterprises: The Los Angeles conglomerate, which owns Southern 
California Gas Co., Thrifty Corp. and Pacific Enterprises Oil Co., posted 
earnings of $68 million, up slightly from a year ago. Revenue totaled $1.91 
billion, a gain of 3%. The results were attributed to an improved performance 
at SoCal Gas, a 2% rise in Thrifty sales and higher oil prices, offset by 
higher depletion expense and lower oil and gas production.
