U.S., JAPAN FIRMS TO DEVELOP GOLF PROJECT 
A San Juan Capistrano developer and a Japanese construction company said 
Thursday that they have bought 430 acres in Camarillo, where they will sell 
land for houses around a lavish 18-hole golf course and country club. 
Pacific Land &amp; Golf Inc. and Sato Kogyo America Corp. said the land 
purchase -- estimated to have cost about $45 million -- is thought to be one of 
the largest ever in Ventura County. 
The partners will sell 186 sites of one to three acres for custom-built houses 
around the country club, called Spanish Hills Golf &amp; Country Club. 
The partners say their market research shows strong demand for the golf course 
in Camarillo, which is midway between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles. 
The ocean-view golf course will be designed by Robert Cupp, who was a course 
designer for 10 years with pro golfer Jack Nicklaus' company. This is 
Atlanta-based Cupp Design Inc.'s first golf course in California. 
Some members of Pacific Land &amp; Golf developed the Marbella Golf and Country 
Club in San Juan Capistrano. 
Sato Kogyo American is a U.S. subsidiary of Sato Kogyo Co., a large Tokyo 
engineering and construction company founded in 1862. It has been involved in 
the U.S. real estate market since 1987. 
Cushman Realty Corp. of Los Angeles was financial adviser to the partnership 
and arranged financing for the $150-million project. Cushman elected to stay on 
as a limited partner, the group said. 
The Spanish-style country club will be designed by Robert Altevers Associates 
of Costa Mesa. The firm has designed many clubhouses, including the La Quinta 
Country Club near Palm Springs.
