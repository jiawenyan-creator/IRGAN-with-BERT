COLLEGE BASKETBALL NATIONAL ROUNDUP; 
HOOSIERS GET A TIMELY LIFT AND EXTEND STREAK 
When Indiana needed a lift in the second half Friday night against Iowa State, 
Calbert Cheaney and Eric Anderson provided it. 
Cheaney scored 18 of his 29 points in the second half and Anderson had nine of 
his 18 during a 19-4 run that enabled the sixth-ranked Hoosiers to beat the 
Cyclones, 87-76, at Ames, Iowa. 
Indiana (10-1) blew a 10-point lead in the first half, fell behind at the start 
of the second half, but then took control of the game. 
The Hoosiers, who extended their winning streak to eight games, made 12 of 
their first 17 shots in the second half and shot 65.4% over the final 20 
minutes. 
"I felt we played pretty well in the second half, almost from the beginning 
right on through," Indiana Coach Bob Knight said. "We had a little bit better 
movement, we got the ball into the kind of shot positions we wanted and we were 
able to play with a little bit more patience once we got an eight- or 10-point 
lead." 
No. 18 Kentucky 84, Western Kentucky 70 -- The Wildcats (6-2) made only nine of 
36 three-point attempts at Louisville, Ky., but their defense forced 26 
turnovers that resulted in 31 points in their first regular-season game against 
the Hilltoppers (2-6). 
The schools had met twice in the NCAA tournament, with Western Kentucky 
winning, 107-83, in 1971, and Kentucky winning, 71-64, in 1986.
