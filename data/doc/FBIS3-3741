  [Text] Seven Hong Kong deputies in the Guangdong 
delegation to the National People's Congress have formulated a 
bill on the Hong Kong issue which is being sponsored by 30 NPC 
deputies, and submitted to the NPC Standing Committee. The bill 
focuses on the following points: 1) It is the British side that 
has terminated the Sino-British talks on political arrangements 
for 1994 and 1995 elections; 2) China will found the first Hong 
Kong Special Administration Region government and legislative 
organization according to the Basic Law and the related 
decisions by the NPC Standing Committee; 3) The legislative 
organization set up unilaterally by the British side during the 
transition period will be terminated after 30 June 1997.
