FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Elkem bounces back into the
black
Elkem, the Norwegian light metals producer, yesterday announced that it had
bounced back to a pre-tax profit of NKr166m (Dollars 21.9m) in 1993 from a
loss of NKr673m in the previous year. Results were helped by improved prices
and volumes for the group's ferro-alloys' products, a cut in domestic energy
taxes and a higher dollar/krone exchange rate.
Nevertheless, Elkem plans to omit its dividend payment for the fourth year
running.
Group net sales were lifted to NKr7.83bn last year from NKr7.3bn in the
previous year as operating costs increased to NKr7.13bn from NKr7bn. Elkem's
operations swung to a profit of NKr397m from a loss of NKr86m, allowing the
group to post a net profit of NKr133m in 1993 against a net loss of NKr610m
in 1992.
Price developments in the second half were positive for ferrosilicon and
ferromanganese and unchanged for silicon metal, but were weaker for
ferrochrome and aluminium, the company said.
Elkem explained that while its cost-savings programme made a significant
contribution to last year's advance, extensive operational interruptions at
some plants had prevented cost targets from being met.
Net financial expenses in 1993 were NKr324m, against NKr511m, which included
net interest expenses of NKr301m, against NKr431m.
