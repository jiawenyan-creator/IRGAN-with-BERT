FT  19 NOV 92 / S African cabinet seeks to defuse army scandal
THE South African cabinet yesterday sought to restore the government's
reputation in the face of accusations that army intelligence had sought to
subvert the African National Congress (ANC).
Further pressure on the government came yesterday from Mr Harry Schwartz,
the South African ambassador to the US, who said he was 'furious and
outraged' at the Goldstone Commission disclosures.
'It has undermined all our effort here, all the hard work that so many
people have put into changing our situation here. There can be no room for
this sort of thing in South Africa,' said Mr Schwartz.
The scandal broke on Monday when Mr Justice Goldstone, appointed by the
government to probe the causes of political violence racking the country,
accused military intelligence of seeking to involve the ANC's armed wing in
common crime.
The revelations are a considerable embarrassment to the government as they
cast doubt on the veracity of previous pledges to stop covert campaigns
against political opponents. They also impede efforts to revive the
constitutional negotiation process, stalled since May.
The ANC has called for an expanded judicial inquiry into the military,
echoing Judge Goldstone's own request for wider powers, more resources and
greater co-operation in carrying out his investigations.
Meanwhile, Mr Gene Louw, minister of defence, said he 'seriously disputed'
several of Judge Goldstone's statements about the affair.
