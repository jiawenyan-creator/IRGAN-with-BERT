for clearing lanes in minefields by the explosive method during 
the course of combat operations. 
  It consists of a guide, base, anchoring device, two 
dispensers, and a spare parts, tools, and accessories kit. It is 
equipped with one UZP-83 mineclearing linear charge. The 
mineclearing charge is contained in two sectional dispensers on 
the ground and feed to the minefield through the air by rocket 
motors. 
  The UR-83P is used as part of a combat engineer squad.
