  [Text] Boston, Feb. 2 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC] 
will send agricultural experts to Burkina Faso to help the west 
African country develop its agriculture and economy, Foreign 
Affairs Minister Chien Fu said Wednesday [2 February]. 
  Chien, who is currently on a speaking tour here, made the 
statement shortly after the ROC and Burkina Faso issued a joint 
communique in Taipei on the resumption of full diplomatic 
relations. 
  The ROC first established diplomatic ties with Burkina Faso, 
then known as Upper Volta, in 1961, but suspended such ties in 
1973 after the African nation recognized Beijing. 
  Chien said the ROC stationed an agricultural mission in 
Burkina Faso in the 1960. "Many Burkina Faso people still 
remembered the achievements of our agricultural mission in 
helping raise their rice production," he noted. 
  The ROC and Burkina Faso began discussion of resuming 
diplomatic ties two years ago. The Burkina Faso cabinet 
formally agreed to resume ties with the ROC in January, Chien 
said. 
  With an area of 274,000 square kilometers and a population 
of 
9.5 million, Burkina Faso became an independent nation in 1960 
after decades of French colonial rule. It is rich in mineral 
resources and produces large quantities of cotton and livestock. 
Its political situation is stable, Chien said. 
  Moreover, Chien added, Burkina Faso has great influence on 
other west African nations. "The resumption of diplomatic ties 
with Burkina Faso will facilitate our effort to promote 
exchanges with that part of the world," he noted. 
  The ROC now maintains full diplomatic ties with eight 
African 
nations -- South Africa, Swaziland, Malawi, Liberia, Niger, 
Guinea-Bissau, the Central African Republic and Burkina Faso. 
  It has opened a consulate general in Calabar, Nigeria and 
set 
up representative offices in Madagascar, Zaire and Angola 
bearing the ROC's full national title.
