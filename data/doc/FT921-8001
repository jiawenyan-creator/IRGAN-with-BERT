FT  19 FEB 92 / Plans for an institute in Russia to employ atomic scientists
in civilian endeavours may be insufficient to stem nuclear brain drain
Plans for an institute in Russia to employ atomic scientists in civilian
endeavours may be insufficient to keep Soviet nuclear know-how from
spreading to other countries, Mr Hans Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign
minister, said yesterday, AP reports from Bonn.
A day earlier, Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, announced in
Moscow that the US would be providing Dollars 25m to help create an
international clearing house in Russia that would gather proposals for
employing former Soviet nuclear scientists in commercial projects.
Germany is also sponsoring the plan. A primary purpose of the project is to
keep the scientists and engineers from selling their knowledge to other
countries. Mr Genscher - a principal architect of the institute scheme -
called Monday's announcement 'an important first step'.
However, the German foreign minister said other measures were needed,
including the 'international isolation' of countries that 'procure
technology for weapons of mass destruction'. He said UN sanctions should be
imposed against such countries.
'I believe that the Security Council should fully make use of the means at
its disposal, especially sanctions, in cases of violations of
non-proliferation principles,' he said.
