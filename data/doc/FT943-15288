FT  09 JUL 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais in talks on
insurer tie-up
Credit Lyonnais, the French state-owned bank, is in talks with potential
partners in the insurance industry, with a view to marketing and
distributing non-life products.
The bank said talks were being held with a number of insurance companies,
but declined to confirm reports that Allianz of Germany was among them. Les
Echos, the French financial daily newspaper, reported yesterday that
high-level discussions had been held with Allianz.
Credit Lyonnais said it was seeking a partnership with a company which could
supply non-life products, to be marketed through the bank's retail network,
and provide after-sales service.
Initially, the partnership would concentrate on the French market, the bank
said.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of Credit Lyonnais, has made no secret of his
desire to find a partner in the insurance sector, and has already approached
Assurances Generales de France.
