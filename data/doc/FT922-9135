FT  09 MAY 92 / Pay-off 202 years on for Madison
IT has taken him 202 years, but James Madison has at last put his final mark
on the US Constitution.
Michigan this week became the 38th state to ratify a constitutional
amendment to limit Congress's right to raise its own pay, first proposed by
Madison in 1789 - when Michigan was under British rule. This gives the
proposal the endorsement of three quarters of the states, enough to allow it
to take its place as the 27th amendment.
In spite of its advanced age, the amendment matches remarkably the mood of
US voters today, when Congress is under sustained attack for voting itself
perks and pay rises. The amendment provides that 'No law varying the
compensation for the services of senators and representatives shall take
effect, until an election of representatives shall have intervened.'
Madison, the principal author of the Bill of Rights, argued that allowing
members to vote themselves an immediate pay rise would show 'indecorum.'
