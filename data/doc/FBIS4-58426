'Arafat signed, with reservations, the annexes attached to the 
Palestinian authority agreement concerning the area of Jericho. 
The Palestinian president expressed his reservations about 
particular points in the agreement and recorded his reservations 
on the annexes in writing. 
  It took 'Arafat over five minutes to write down his 
reservations on the agreement. He registered his reservations 
in Arabic and then signed them in Arabic and English. 
  Rabin was then briefed by his interpreter on the 
reservations 
stated by President 'Arafat. Rabin signed the annexes without 
stating any remarks or reservations. 
  The signing of the annexes by 'Arafat and Rabin was met with 
a storm of applause by the audience.

ceremony.
