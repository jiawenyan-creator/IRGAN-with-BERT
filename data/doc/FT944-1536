FT  20 DEC 94 / Radio reforms fail to boost audiences
The recent renaissance in radio may prove short-lived as more stations open
and listening patterns fragment, says the latest Cultural Trends report from
the Policy Studies Institute.
The report suggests that although the reforms in the 1990 Broadcasting Act
have had little effect on television viewing, they have had a dramatic
impact on radio.
New stations, such as Classic FM and Virgin 1215, have built sizeable
audiences but they have taken listeners from the established national
stations. They have not expanded overall audience, just as video, cable and
satellite have not increased television viewing.
BBC1, BBC2, ITV and Channel 4 television channels have recaptured some of
their lost share of viewing in cabled homes, the Independent Television
Commission says. They raised their share to 65.1 per cent in October from
57.9 per cent in October last year.
