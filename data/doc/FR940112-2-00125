I. Description



The proposal codifies, without substantive change, various requirements that the NASD has implemented, pursuant
to Commission approval, since the OTCBB was launched as a pilot program on June 1, 1990. Specifically, these requirements
are included in the following Rule 19b4 NASD filings approved by the Commission: (1) File No. SRNASD8819
(as amended), detailing the basic operational requirements for the OTCBB;
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 (2) File No. SRNASD9037, expanding by one-half hour the quotation-update period applicable
to market makers in foreign/ADR issues;
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 (3) File No. SRNASD9112, establishing a firm quote requirement for all priced bids/offers in
domestic equity securities; and (4) File No. SRNASD9138, establishing the parameters for an
inside bid-ask calculation.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Additionally, the codification references two recently approved regulatory initiatives affecting the OTCBB and
participating member firms: (1) File No. SRNASD9248, concerning real-time trade reporting
requirements for OTC equity securities;
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 and (2) File No. SRNASD9317, revising the minimum quotation size requirements for OTCBB market
makers.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The present proposal provides that these initiatives will be published, respectively, in Part XIII of Schedule D
to the NASD By-Laws and Section 5 of Schedule H to the NASD By-Laws.

</FOOTNAME>
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28404 (August 31, 1990), 55 FR 37791 (September 3, 1990). The codification provides
that, with respect to a priced bid and/or offer entered into OTCBB for a foreign equity security or an ADR, a market maker
may update quotation entries twice daily (once between 8:30 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. ET, and once between noon and 21:30 p.m.
ET).

</FOOTNAME>
For any equity security quoted in the OTCBB, an inside bid-ask calculation (i.e., the highest bid and lowest offer
being displayed by market makers registered in a particular security) is available only if the security has at least
two registered market makers, each displaying a priced bid and offer. If additional market makers are displaying
either one or two-sided quotations, those entries also are factored into the inside calculation. On the other hand,
if the basic requirement of two market makers is not satisfied, an indication is generated denoting that no inside
calculation is available.

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32570 (July 1, 1993), 58 FR 36725 (July 8, 1993). File No. SRNASD9317,
approved by the Commission, replaced the previous 100-share minimum quote size requirement for OTCBB with a tiered
structure for mandatory minimum quote size based on the price of the bid or offer.

II. Discussion



The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with sections 15A(b) (6) and (11) of the Act. Section
15A(b)(6) requires, in pertinent part, that NASD rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts or
practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions
in securities, and in general to protect investors and the public interest. Section 15A(b)(11) requires that the
rules of the NASD include provisions governing the form and content of quotations relating to securities sold otherwise
than on a national securities exchange and that those rules, among other things, be designed to promote orderly procedures
for collecting, distributing, and publishing quotations.

The Commission believes that, because the proposal embodies existing operational requirements that have been in
place but, until now, have not been codified as NASD rules, the proposal should facilitate NASD members' efforts to
research pertinent requirements by referencing a discrete section of the NASD Manual. Thus, the codification should
facilitate members' ability to comply with the requirements since they will be in a readily accessible form. Moreover,
the codification should promote orderly procedures for collecting, distributing, and publishing OTCBB quotations
since those procedures now will be found in the NASD Manual. In sum, the Commission believes the proposed codification
should facilitate the NASD's administration of and member firms' compliance with the operational requirements
that are unique to the OTCBB, thereby furthering the purposes of sections 15A(b) (6) and (11) and the Act in general.



It is therefore ordered, 

Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule change (SRNASD9356) is approved.
