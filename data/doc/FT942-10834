FT  09 MAY 94 / Smaller car dealers lose share of market
Significant changes are under way in the structure and ownership of
franchised car dealership networks in the UK with large groups expanding
rapidly at the expense of individually owned dealerships.
The main groups such as Lex Service and Inchcape now own more than a third
of the 7,000-plus franchised dealerships compared with just a quarter in
1990, according to Sewells International, the motor-trade monitoring group.
Some of these groups are also beating down manufacturer resistance to
'multi-franchising' - selling more than one make from a single site - and
leading the expansion of UK car retailing methods into continental Europe by
buying dealerships in other EU countries.
Sewells attributes the continuing decline in individually owned dealerships
mainly to the recession. At the same time, would-be individual dealers are
being discouraged by the 'prohibitive' cost of setting up a dealership -
often more than Pounds 1m.
The UK motor trade owned 19 outlets abroad in 1990. By last year the total
had grown to 93 and is still expanding, Sewells says.
Its analysis of the dealer network structure shows that 357 multi-franchise
sites were operating by the end of last year, compared with just 120 in
1990.
