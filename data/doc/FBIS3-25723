  [Text] Yesterday, the president of the republic, Major 
General Juvenal Habyarimana, traveled to Gbadolite in Zaire. 
While there he met his Zairean counterpart, Marshal Mobutu Sese 
Seko, and Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi. The three heads of 
state exchanged views on ways of reviving the Economic Community 
of the Great Lakes Countries [CEPGL] so that the community could 
achieve its objectives. 
  They also talked about the crucial problems facing our three 
countries. Presidents Habyarimana and Mobutu took the 
opportunity to tell the new Burundi president, Cyprien 
Ntaryamira, that they were happy with his nomination as the 
president of Burundi. They wished him success in his new duties 
and guaranteed him their support.
