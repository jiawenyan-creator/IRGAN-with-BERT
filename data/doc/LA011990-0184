JAMES BROWN PRISON WORK RELEASE HELD UP BY SNAFU BETWEEN STATES 
Imprisoned soul singer James Brown technically is eligible for a work release 
program today, but he won't be released because South Carolina authorities have 
questions about his Georgia sentence. 
"Back in January he was sentenced in Georgia to a total of six years and three 
months, which was to run concurrently with his South Carolina sentence of six 
years and six months," Department of Corrections spokesman Francis X. Archibald 
said Thursday. 
"When it comes to work release, our laws are different, and we have asked his 
attorney to get his Georgia status clear. We haven't heard back," he said. 
Brown, 56, was jailed a year ago today for aggravated assault and failing to 
stop for police. He already was on probation for a guilty plea involving 
carrying an unlawful pistol and resisting arrest and a no-contest plea to 
possession of the hallucinogenic drug phencyclidine hydrochloride, or PCP. 
"At this point, I really don't have enough information to discuss what will 
happen," said Brown's lawyer, Buddy Dallas of Thomson, Ga. "It's just 
bureaucracy. The only way to complicate this any more is to get a third state 
involved in it." 
Unofficially, prison officials say they understand that Brown will not be 
eligible for parole in Georgia until 1992. If that is the case, he would not be 
eligible for work release in South Carolina until March.
