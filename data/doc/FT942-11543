FT  05 MAY 94 / Observer: Solly's kind of lolly
Nothing new in the concept of performance-related pay for senior executives,
but Salomon Brothers has gone one further by rewarding its chairman
according to his showing within his peer group.
British-born chairman Deryck Maughan will now be paid according to how
Solly's return on equity compares with that of Merrill Lynch, Morgan
Stanley, Bear Stearns, JP Morgan and Bankers Trust.
Last year Maughan raked in Dollars 7m in cash and stock benefits - a figure
loosely tied to performance. Now he will receive no bonus at all, and a
salary of just Dollars 1m, if the firm's ROE is as low as 5 per cent and
equals that of its five rivals.
But he would be looking at a maximum bonus of Dollars 25m, were ROE to top
30 per cent and exceed the average of the five rivals by 10 per cent.
Admittedly, it's a stiff task. Last year's return was 23 per cent, against
an average of 26 per cent for the rest. But with Dollars 25m on offer,
wouldn't you do your darndest?
