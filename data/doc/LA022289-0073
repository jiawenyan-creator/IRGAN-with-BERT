Margo Adams, the former lover of Boston third baseman Wade Boggs, details 
graphic descriptions of the sex lives of several Red Sox players in an article 
that appears in the April issue of Penthouse magazine. 
Adams, who is suing Boggs for $12 million, is being paid a minimum of $100,000 
by the magazine for the story. 
In the article, Adams also accused Boggs of making racist remarks in regard to 
teammates. 
Al Nero, Boggs' agent, said "it's a very sick, weak attempt on Margo's part to 
hurt Wade and his teammates." 
Boggs, in a statement issued by his lawyer, Jennifer King, said: "I'm going to 
take a day and then decide if I'm going to make any kind of statement," Boggs 
said in a statement issued by his lawyer, Jennifer King.
