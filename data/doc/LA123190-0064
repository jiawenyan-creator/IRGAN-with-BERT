TRANSFER OF RIGHT-TO-DIE PATIENT HALTED 
The father of a brain-damaged patient at the hospital where Nancy Cruzan was 
allowed to die after a court fight has been blocked from moving his daughter to 
a state where her feeding tube could be removed with less legal strife. 
Pete Busalacchi says his daughter should be allowed to die. 
But Don Lamkins, director of the Missouri Rehabilitation Center, contends 
Christine Busalacchi has mental functions and responds to commands. 
Christine Busalacchi, 20, has spent 3 1/2 years in a vegetative state similar 
to that of Cruzan, who died after becoming a focus of national debate and a 
landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the right to die. 
The Busalacchi case renewed warnings Sunday from euthanasia opponents that a 
"tidal wave" of death for hopeless patients would result from the Cruzan case. 
Lamkins said Sunday that a 10-day restraining order issued Saturday will give 
doctors time to examine Christine Busalacchi. A judge has scheduled a Jan. 8 
hearing to hear results of the tests. 
Busalacchi said that he was angry and frustrated about the legal action. 
"My feeling is my daughter died a long time ago, and all that's left is just a 
machine," he said. 
"I will not see my daughter held prisoner in Missouri." 
Busalacchi expected to move his daughter on Saturday to Minneapolis, where 
specialists were to decide whether her tube should be removed.
