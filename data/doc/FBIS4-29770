  [Text] Seoul, June 21 (YONHAP) -- Ruling Democratic Liberal 
Party [DLP] Chairman Kim Chong-pil, while disputing former U.S. 
President Jimmy Carter's view of North Korea, stressed on 
Tuesday there should be no relaxation of vigilance over North 
Korea until the nuclear issue is resolved. 
  In a lecture at a DLP training session held at the Veterans 
Association Building in eastern Seoul, Kim belittled a set of 
North Korean offers made during Carter's visit to North Korea. 
  "Mr. Carter is saying the North Korean offer for reduction 
of the two sides' Armed Forces to the 100,000-man level is 
reasonable, but this is no more than the repetition of what Kim 
Il-song has been voicing since long ago," he said. 
  Kim said he was stunned to hear Carter say "Kim Il-song is 
reasonable, honest and enjoying people's trust." 
  "That naive man, it seems, was duped in many ways in North 
Korea," he said. 
  Yi Se-ki, chairman of the DLP Policy Committee, too, said at 
the session that Kim Il-song is waging a time-earning tactic by 
inviting Carter in a move to escape international sanctions. 
  "Kim Il-song likes Carter very much because he promoted the 
withdrawal of American forces from Korea immediately after the 
fall of South Vietnam," Yi said.
