  [Text] Kiev -- After talks with the Crimean president on 4 
February, Roman Shpek, minister of the economy of Ukraine and a 
participant in the talks, said at a news conference that "the 
first meeting after the inauguration of the president of Crimea 
and the establishment of contacts proceeded in a normal way" and 
with "caution on the Crimean side." According to Roman Shpek, 
"Crimea has proposed that an economic experiment be conducted 
with the granting of economic independence to the region's 
economy, that is, complete self-financing." 
  The minister of the economy of Ukraine evaluated the desire 
of the Crimean representatives not as an "economic program" but 
more as a "statement of intent." The president of Ukraine 
promised to examine the proposals of representatives of the 
republic of the Crimea on the basis of economic calculations. 
The government will be represented by experts from the ministry 
of the economy, the ministry of finance, the state property 
fund, and the National Bank of Ukraine at talks with the 
Crimeans in future.
