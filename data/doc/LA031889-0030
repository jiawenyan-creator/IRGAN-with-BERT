BRAY DEFEATS IRISH CHAMPION IN 3-ROUND HEAVYWEIGHT BOUT 
Heavyweight boxer John Bray of Van Nuys won a unanimous three-round decision 
over Irish national champion Sean O'Reagan on Friday at Caesars Atlantic City 
during a U.S.-Ireland amateur dual meet. 
The United States won the meet, 7-3, in the first head-to-head meeting between 
the nations since 1985. 
Bray, 18, who had not fought since losing in the final of the Western Olympic 
Trials last May, said that the layoff had hurt him. He also pinned some of his 
problems on failing to maintain his prefight strategy. 
"I got away from my game plan," Bray said. "First I was going to box him, but 
then I thought I could hurt him. I thought I could have taken him out with my 
right hand, but it didn't happen." STEVEN HERBERT
