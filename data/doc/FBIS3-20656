  [Text] With the national economy in rapid growth, and the 
need to meet the electric power requirements for the second 
round of strategic economic and social targets, the Ministry of 
Electric Power, after readjustments, has set extraordinary 
development targets for 2000: From 1995 to 1997, the average 
annual increase in large and middle-sized power generators will 
be above 15,000MW; from 1998 to 2000, the annual average 
increase will be over 20,000MW, and by the end of this century 
the total national installed capacity, building on the 166,000MW 
foundation at the end of 1992, will reach about 310,000MW, which 
will be about one-fourth more than the original target of 
240,000MW. 
  Experts say that at this rate of growth, if the gross value 
of national economic output can increase at a rate of 8 to 9 
percent per year over the next several years, and social power 
consumption reduces by 8 to 9 percent, China will basically meet 
its target of relieving the power shortage, and electrify all 
counties by the end of the century. 
  To reach these targets, the Ministry of Electric Power will 
observe the policy of "incorporate, commercialize operations, 
and legalize management," and as fast as possible introduce 
enterprise management reforms, and establish modernized 
enterprise system. At the same time it will establish statutes 
(electric power laws), and by the end of the century, establish 
laws and regulations for the electric power industry management 
system that will be appropriate to China's special circumstances 
and the socialist market economy. 
  In 1988, the Chinese electric power industry's newly 
installed capacity reached 12,000MW for the first time, and it 
has continued to reach that target every year for six years. 
This year it could go as high as 15,000MW, with new large and 
middle-sized units increasing by 12,000MW. This way, by year's 
end, the national installed capacity total could reach 
181,000MW, and be the fourth largest in the world.
