Antidrug Program for Personnel Engaged in Specified Aviation Activities 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 (the Act), amended the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to provide
a statutory mandate for drug testing of air carrier employees. The Act also prescribed certain consequences for prohibited
drug use and mandated the use of split specimen testing. This rule amends the antidrug rule for conformity to the requirements
of the Act. 



In addition, this rule incorporates other changes to the antidrug rule. These changes clarify the requirements of
the rule and also address concerns that have been raised since the rule was published. 

Finally, this rule includes substantive changes to address provisions of the rule that are unclear, do not comport
with the changes in the final DOT drug testing procedures, or do not adequately address required steps in the implementation
process.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE:

 This final rule is effective on September 19, 1994, except the amendment to part 121, appendix I, VI.C. which is effective
August 15, 1994.

Background 



On November 14, 1988, the FAA issued an antidrug rule which required specified aviation employers and operators to
initiate antidrug programs for personnel performing safety-sensitive functions. 

On October 28, 1991, the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 (the Act) was enacted. Among other things,
the Act provided a statutory mandate for drug testing in the aviation industry and required specified consequences
for positive drug tests. A notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), published on February 15, 1994, proposed amendments
to certain provisions of the FAA's antidrug rule in accordance with the Act. The NPRM also proposed certain other changes
to the antidrug rule that would clarify employer and Medical Review Officer responsibilities and addressed other
issues that have been identified since the promulgation of the rule. This rule incorporates the requirements of the
statutory mandate, as well as the clarifying amendments. 

Seven comments were received in the docket in response to the NPRM. These comments were taken into consideration during
the development of this final rule. 



Reason for Expedited Effective Date 



A section of this rule concerning split specimen testing is being made effective in less than the 30 days from publication
usually required by law. With an effective date of August 15, 1994, for this section the FAA can ensure that this rule
is consistent with the DOT final rule which was published on February 15, 1994 (59 FR 7354). The DOT rule implements
split specimen collection testing required by the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991, as of August
15, 1994, for four modal administrations under the DOT. The DOT rule provided affected employers 6 months to begin
implementing split specimen testing. Because employers have been given prior notification of the requirement for
split specimen testing, employers subject to this rule will not be unduly burdened by an effective date of less than
30 days. The FAA has therefore determined that good cause exists under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 533(d)(3) to warrant
an expedited effective date.
