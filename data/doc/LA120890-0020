TRAUMA CARE AT COUNTY-USC MEDICAL CENTER 
Apart from containing several errors, the report ignores some important facts. 
Firstly, the Department of Emergency Medicine provides attending staff coverage 
24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
The attending emergency physician is board certified with up to 15 years 
experience in resuscitation. Since this physician is ultimately responsible for 
all medical care delivered in the Emergency Department and is the most 
experienced physician on scene, he has to have the authority to determine the 
initial treatment of emergency cases. The surgical care is determined by the 
most senior surgery resident on the scene. 
Secondly, the report suggests that "turf battles" have resulted in poor patient 
outcomes. In the six years I have spent in the medical center, I can honestly 
say that I have never seen or heard of any patient dying in the Emergency 
Department because of a "turf battle." 
Additionally, I think it is important to point out that the majority of trauma 
patients in the U.S. are not initially treated in "trauma centers." In fact 
most states do not have specifically designated trauma centers. Patients are 
stabilized initially by emergency physicians. 
Although emergency medicine is a relatively new medical specialty, residency 
training programs have been in existence for almost 20 years and board 
certification has existed for 10 years (not one year as stated in the article). 
To scrap a system which works well on the basis of the ACS surveyor's report 
would be unjust.
