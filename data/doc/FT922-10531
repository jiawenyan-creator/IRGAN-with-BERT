FT  30 APR 92 / 'Improved image' for estate agents
THE RECESSION and tighter regulations governing estate agents are combining
to improve the image of the profession, Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general
of fair trading, said yesterday.
Complaints were still being made, but the image of estate agents had
improved, he told the annual conference of the National Association of
Estate Agents in London.
'A short time ago, the image of estate agents could hardly have been worse,'
he said.
'Any stand-up comedian searching for an easy laugh could . . . (conjure) up
a picture of a wide boy with a cellular phone making a fortune out of other
peoples' homes with very little effort.'
The Office of Fair Trading had banned about 155 estate agents from the
property business in the past 10 years, and recently the rate of expulsions
had increased.
There was also a rise in complaints about estate agents.
