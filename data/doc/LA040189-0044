DEMONSTRATIONS BY OPERATION RESCUE 
I'm sure you'll get barraged with complaints about Chief Gates' aggressive 
handling of the Operation Rescue demonstrations, but for all those silently 
thankful, I'll say it: Thank you, Chief Gates! It's time the tail stopped 
wagging the dog on this issue. 
A woman considering an abortion is in fact considering denying the 
responsibility associated with rearing that child. Few women undertake such a 
decision lightly, and those who would force the woman to follow through and 
bear the child under such circumstances cannot claim to have the child's 
welfare at heart, gut-level sloganeering notwithstanding.
