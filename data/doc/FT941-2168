FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Price cuts take toll on Swiss
drugs group
Ares-Serono, the Geneva pharmaceuticals group that specialises in fertility
drugs, reported a 33 per cent slide in 1993 net income to Dollars 72.5m.
However, the fall was exaggerated by an extraordinary Dollars 27.7m gain on
the sale of assets in 1992. Net income from continuing operations was down
9.4 per cent.
Sales fell 12 per cent to Dollars 755.3m, hurt by currency devaluations in
Italy and Spain and drug price reductions imposed by governments in several
countries.
The group said the improvement in operating margin was due to cost-cutting.
The diagnostic division, accounting for 12 per cent of group sales, returned
to profit.
Pre-tax profits were down 17 per cent to Dollars 100.6m.
Movenpick, the Swiss hotel and restaurant group, said consolidated net
income recovered slightly to SFr8.5m (Dollars 5.9m) last year from SFr6.5m
in 1992, on sales up 1.5 per cent to SFr1.25bn.
Mr Ulrich Geissmann, chief executive, said measures to strengthen the group,
which changed hands two years ago, had already begun to take effect.
