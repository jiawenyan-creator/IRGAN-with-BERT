PARK AVENUE JOE DECLARED WINNER OF HAMBLETONIAN AFTER DEAD HEAT 
Probe, winner of the first heat, and Park Avenue Joe, winner of the second, 
raced to the first dead heat in a Hambletonian race-off Saturday at the 
Meadowlands. 
Park Avenue Joe, however, was declared the winner because he finished second in 
the first heat. Probe broke stride and finished ninth in the second heat. 
Park Avenue Joe is trained by Chuck Sylvester, who also won the Hambletonian in 
1987 with Mack Lobell. 
Park Avenue Joe won $565,500 from a purse of $1,131,000. Probe won $282,750. 
Park Avenue Joe led throughout the race-off but, nearing the wire, Probe 
appeared to have a slight lead. Stewards called for two prints of the photo 
finish and deliberated for several minutes before declaring the race for 
3-year-old trotters a dead heat. 
The time for the one-mile race-off was 2:00 2/5. The last quarter was trotted 
in a fast :26 3/5.
