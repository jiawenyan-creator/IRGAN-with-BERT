LEFT, RIGHT 
Why is it necessary for presumably objective journalists to characterize 
Nicaragua as "leftist" when noting that Nicaragua opposed the invasion of 
Panama by rightist United States military aggressors ("World Reaction to 
Noriega's Arrest," Jan. 5)? Centrist Spain, left-centrist Mexico and the 
leftist Soviet Union also opposed the intervention, but their political 
persuasions were not worthy of comment. Your staff even failed to observe the 
"rightishness" of Britain, Japan and Thailand.
