FT  26 NOV 92 / Construction orders continue to run below levels
IN SPITE OF of a pick-up in the third quarter, construction orders continue
to run below the corresponding levels for last year according to figures
published yesterday by the environment department, Andrew Taylor writes.
Total orders received by contractors in Britain during the three months to
the end of September were 17 per cent higher than during the preceding three
months but 1 per cent lower than during the third quarter last year.
The figures are based on the value of orders at constant (1985) prices
adjusted to exclude normal seasonal variations.
