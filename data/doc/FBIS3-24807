  [Text] All bureaux de change in the country have been 
directed not to sell foreign exchange any longer. They are now 
limited to the buying of foreign exchange as agents of the 
Central Bank. According to the guidelines on monetary and fiscal 
policy for the current year, the bureaux de change will 
surrender all foreign exchange bought by them to the CBN 
[Central Bank of Nigeria] at the official rate of 22 naira to 
the dollar. They will be entitled to a commission to be decided 
in due course. The guidelines emphasized that the measures are 
taken to create the right environment for the strengthening of 
the value of the naira. It is reiterated that the foreign 
exchange parallel market, otherwise known as the black market, 
remains illegal and the operators of such markets would be 
severely penalized. 
  A decree to implement the new measures and to harmonize the 
existing regulations with the new policy direction will soon be 
promulgated. It will also stipulate penalties for 
infringements. The guidelines require dealers authorized by the 
Central Bank to render prompt, accurate, and coordinated returns 
on foreign exchange transactions entered into on behalf of the 
CBN. Appropriate sanctions are to be imposed on authorized 
dealers who release funds on the basis of forged documents or 
fail to furnish accurate and prompt returns or refuse to report 
defaulting customers. The importation and exportation of naira, 
according to the guidelines, also remain prohibited. However, 
residents going abroad are allowed to carry up to 500 naira on 
them for settlement of local transport expenses immediately on 
their return to Nigeria.
