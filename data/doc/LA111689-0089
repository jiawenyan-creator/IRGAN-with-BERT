PRESIDENT'S STANCE 
President Bush campaigned as an environmentally concerned candidate, but his 
present stance (Times Editorial Oct. 30) belies that concern. 
Instead of advocating stronger protection for the public against toxic 
ingredients, he seeks to lower the standard of protection. 
Because health care accounts for one of the largest shares of the national 
budget, it behooves those who oversee government agencies to err on the side of 
caution. The care for one single cancer victim is astronomical. 
The image President Bush has portrayed since taking office is a far cry from 
the "kinder, gentler" person he professed to be during his campaign.
