FT  16 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Swiss drop bond issuance tax
THE SWISS federal cabinet yesterday abolished stamp tax on Swiss franc bond
issuance by foreign borrowers with effect from April 1, AP-DJ reports from
Zurich.
It was feared the 0.15 per cent tax on secondary market purchases, and 0.30
per cent tax on primary market purchases, would see Swiss franc bond
issuance by foreign borrowers move from Switzerland to foreign marketplaces.
The federal council was given the power to remove the stamp tax in a
national referendum on September 27.
Also, according to the Swiss finance ministry, a rule requiring that Swiss
franc foreign bonds be syndicated by banks located in Switzerland, would be
replaced by a regulation requiring only that the lead manager of the issue
be located in Switzerland and not the entire syndicate.
