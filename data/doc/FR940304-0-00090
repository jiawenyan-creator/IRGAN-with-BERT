 

Natural changes to habitat and substrate can result in the death 
of individual plants as well as the destruction of their habitat. This 
especially affects the continued existence of taxa or populations with 
limited numbers and/or narrow ranges and is often exacerbated by human 
disturbance and land use practices (See Factor A). Landslides produced by 
burrowing seabirds in an offshore islet population of 

Ischaemum byrone

 are 
a potential threat to that species (HHP 1991m10; R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 
1992). Flooding is a threat to 

Clermontia peleana

, which often grows in a 
riparian habitat (Bruegmann 1990, CPC 1990). A population of 

Ischaemum 
byrone

 is presumed to have been destroyed by volcanic activity, and another 
population is affected by drifting black sand (HHP 1991m3; C. Lamoureux, 
pers. comm., 1992). Some populations of 

Silene hawaiiensis

 are also 
considered to be threatened by volcanic activity (HPCC 1991j). 

People are more likely to come into contact with taxa that have 
populations near trails or roads or in recreational areas. Alien plants 
may be introduced into such areas as seeds on footwear, or people may cause 
erosion, trample plants, or start fires (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). The 
following taxa have populations in recreational areas or close to roads or 
trails and are immediately or potentially threatened by human disturbance: 


Clermontia peleana

, 

Clermontia pyrularia

, 

Colubrina oppositifolia

, 

Cyrtandra giffardii

, 

Ischaemum byrone

, 

Nothocestrum breviflorum

, 

Portulaca sclerocarpa

, 

Silene hawaiiensis

, 

Tetramolopium arenarium

, and 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense

.

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and 
commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future 
threats faced by these taxa in determining to issue this final rule. Based 
on this evaluation, this rulemaking will list these 20 plant taxa as 
endangered: 

Clermontia lindseyana

, 

Clermontia peleana

, 

Clermontia pyrularia

, 

Colubrina oppositifolia

, 

Cyanea copelandii

 ssp. 

copelandii

, 

Cyanea hamatiflora

 ssp. 

carlsonii

, 

Cyanea shipmanii

, 

Cyanea stictophylla

, 

Cyrtandra giffardii

, 

Cyrtandra tintinnabula

, 

Ischaemum byrone

, 

Isodendrion pyrifolium

, 

Mariscus fauriei

, 

Nothocestrum breviflorum

, 

Ochrosia kilaueaensis

, 

Plantago hawaiensis

, 

Portulaca sclerocarpa

, 

Pritchardia affinis

, 

Tetramolopium arenarium

, and 

Zanthoxylum hawaiiense

. One taxon is listed as threatened, 

Silene hawaiiensis

. Fourteen of the taxa determined to be endangered number no more than about 100 individuals and/or are known from 5
or fewer populations. The 20 taxa are threatened by 1 or more of the following: habitat degradation and/or predation
by axis deer, cattle, goats, insects, pigs, rats, and sheep; competition from alien plants; fire and natural disasters;
human and military impacts; and lack of legal protection or difficulty in enforcing laws which are already in effect.
Small population size and limited distribution make these taxa particularly vulnerable to extinction and/or reduced
reproductive vigor from stochastic events. Because these 20 taxa are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant
portion of their ranges, they fit the definition of endangered as defined in the Act. 

Although all populations of 

Silene hawaiiensis

 are threatened to 
some degree by fire, competition with alien plant species, predation by 
feral animals, and/or human activities, the widespread distribution of 
populations, rocky habitat, presence of population regeneration, and total 
numbers of plants reduces the danger that this species will become extinct 
in the near future. For these reasons, this species is not now in 
immediate danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of 
its range. However, 

Silene hawaiiensis

 is likely to become endangered in 
the foreseeable future if the threats are not curbed. As a result, 

Silene hawaiiensis

 fits the definition of a threatened species as defined in the 
Act. 



Hesperocnide sandwicensis

 has been reassessed with regard to the 
five factors addressed above and the new information about the species' 
abundance and location. Although individual plants and populations of 
plants are threatened by competition from alien grasses, grazing by feral 
pigs, goats, and sheep, habitat disturbance and damage to plants as a 
result of military exercises, and fire, large reproductive populations 
located throughout PTA are relatively secure from these threats. The 
Service now finds that 

Hesperocnide sandwicensis

 fails to meet the 
definition of either an endangered or threatened species, and has withdrawn 
it from consideration for endangered or threatened status (see notice of 
withdrawal published concurrently in this 

Federal Register

). 

Critical habitat is not being designated for the 21 taxa included 
in this rule, for reasons discussed in the 

Critical Habitat 

section of 
this rule.
