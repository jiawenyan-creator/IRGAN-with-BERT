FT  13 MAR 93 / New facts in hunt for Salvation Army cash
SOLICITORS acting for the Salvation Army were yesterday studying new
information as part of their efforts to recover more than Pounds 6m
allegedly missing from the charity's funds, Jimmy Burns writes.
The information is contained in the form of an affidavit signed by Mr Mark
Duffy which was handed to Slaughter &amp; May, the army's solicitors, prior to a
High Court hearing yesterday.
The hearing was related to a court order under which Mr Duffy and 14
defendants named in a writ were required to disclose information relating to
the whereabouts of the sum of Dollars 8.8m, formerly standing in an account
held at Banque Continentale du Luxembourg.
Mr Mark Duffy was named in the writ because of his association with Mr
Stuart Ford, a Birmingham-based businessman who is alleged to have conspired
to defraud the Salvation Army. There is no claim of wrongdoing against Mr
Duffy.
In his affidavit Mr Duffy blames his failure to submit information earlier
to the Salvation Army on the fact that he had temporarily had to leave the
country to avoid the attentions of the media.
