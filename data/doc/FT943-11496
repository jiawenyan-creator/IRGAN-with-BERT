FT  29 JUL 94 / Shell Oil battered by charges
After-tax charges of Dollars 451m, more than half of them due to an
explosion at a chemical plant in Ohio, pushed Shell Oil, the US arm of the
Royal Dutch/Shell group, into loss in the second three months of the year.
Its chemicals operations were hit by charges of Dollars 233m, stemming from
litigation, property losses, and damage claims arising from the explosion,
as well as the write-off of assets and the sale of a subsidiary. Three
employees died in the accident at the plant in Belpre, Ohio.
These costs more than wiped out a Dollars 85m profit - up from Dollars 30m
last time - in the business during the quarter.
Shell Oil also took a Dollars 154m charge on its non-operating activities.
This related mainly to a write-down of a coal investment, to what it called
'approximate published estimates of market value'.
It also reported a Dollars 66m charge on undeveloped properties in Alaska
and non-producing oil properties in California. The level of oil prices, and
the failure of other companies which had drilled in the same area made
future production 'highly unlikely', the company said.
Hit by these costs, Shell Oil reported an after-tax loss of Dollars 194m,
compared with a profit of Dollars 203m in the second quarter of 1993.
Leaving aside the effect of one-off items, the company said it would have
reported earnings of Dollars 257m, up 20 per cent from a year before.
