NATION; 
FARRAKHAN CAN SEE BARRY TRIAL 
The judge presiding over the drug and perjury trial of Mayor Marion Barry 
reversed himself today and said two black leaders will be admitted as 
spectators. 
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said Nation of Islam Minister Louis 
Farrakhan and Imani Temple Bishop George A. Stallings Jr. will be permitted to 
attend the trial as long as they "observe the proprieties of the court." 
Last week the judge refused to allow the two in as spectators, saying their 
presence would be potentially disruptive and intimidating.
