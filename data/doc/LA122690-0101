MORE WOMEN DOCTORATES BY 2001 
By the year 2001, women for the first time will earn more doctorates than men, 
there will be more high school graduates than the 1977 peak and the ranks of 
classroom teachers will swell, the Education Department projected today. 
The trends for the next 10 years are included in the Education Department's 
publication, "Projections of Education Statistics to 2001. " 
In 1976, women earned 7,800 doctoral degrees, while men earned 26,300, the 
department said. Trends now indicate the ratio will flip. By 2001, women are 
expected to earn 18,900 doctorates, while men will earn just 17,300. 
However, the Education Department said men will continue to earn more 
professional degrees than women in such fields as medicine and law.
