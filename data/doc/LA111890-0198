EXPERTS IDENTIFY REMAINS OF SAINT CANDIDATE 
Scientists have positively identified a skeleton exhumed from a New York 
cemetery as the remains of a Haitian slave who is a candidate to become 
America's first black saint, Cardinal John J. O'Connor said Saturday. 
A team of archeologists, forensic scientists and anthropologists determined 
that a skeleton dug up earlier this month was that of Pierre Toussaint, the 
cardinal said. 
Toussaint was born in 1766 and brought to New York at age 21 by his French 
owners. Still enslaved, he became a leading hairdresser in the city and was 
allowed to keep some of his income. 
Freed in 1807, he bought the freedom of slaves and lavished money on charities, 
including an orphanage and the city's first school for black children. 
He is considered the founder of Catholic Charities because he helped the needy 
for 66 years when no formal systems of assistance existed.
