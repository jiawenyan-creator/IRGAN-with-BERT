FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Asarco to make Dollars 122m
provision for 1992
ASARCO, the US mining and metals group, is to make a Dollars 122m after-tax
provision to its 1992 results. The group reported net earnings of Dollars
30.4m, or 74 cents a share ,for the nine months to September.
The provision will include Dollars 57m for the adoption of Financial
Accounting Standard Board Statement (FASB) 106 on accounting for
post-retirement benefits. Mr Richard Osborne, chairman, said the company had
the option of spreading the liability over 20 years, but 'rather than
burdening future earnings with this charge, we prefer to put it behind us.'
There will also be a Dollars 43m addition to the provision for environmental
costs associated with historic operations. At the end of the third quarter,
Asarco's environmental reserve stood at Dollars 92m. Mr Osborne said that
recent developments had enabled Asarco to estimate requirements with more
certainty.
The company is also including a Dollars 22m charge for the write-off of
certain older facilities following completion of its expansion and
modernisation programme.
Asarco has also adopted FASB 109, 'accounting for income taxes,' which will
not require a charge to 1992 earnings but prior-year earnings will be
reduced and restated by Dollars 20m. Of that, Dollars 13m will be made to
1990 earnings and the balance to the years before.
