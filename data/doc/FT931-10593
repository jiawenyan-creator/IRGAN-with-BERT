FT  08 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: US bonds
The US Treasury has given a hint of things to come in setting the amounts
for auction in this week's quarterly funding. By cutting the amount of 30-
and 10-year bonds on offer, it appears to be signalling a preference for
funding at the short end of the yield curve where rates are cheaper. It may
be several months before this is confirmed as official policy. But a move
which might hold down long yields must seem doubly tempting in that it could
reduce the residential mortgage rate and lift consumer confidence.
The trouble is that nothing comes without a price. If lower supply pushes
long-term rates down, extra supply will quickly push short-term rates up by
a similar amount. That will penalise companies which borrow in the
commercial paper market as well as homeowners who have borrowed at variable
rates. As the yield curve flattens, commercial banks would lose the windfall
gained from using cut-price deposits to buy Treasury bonds.
Still bigger risks are that the Clinton administration will fail to curb the
budget deficit and that recovery will eventually rekindle inflation. Then
refinancing a swollen pile of short-term debt would prove expensive. The
Treasury could rue the day it looked askance at 30-year money costing little
more than 7 per cent. The size of any fiscal stimulus and any subsequent
deficit reduction will have a larger impact on where yields finally settle
than shifting borrowing down the yield curve.
