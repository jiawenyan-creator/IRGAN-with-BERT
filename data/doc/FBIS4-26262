  [Text] Tianjin, June 19 (XINHUA) -- The '94 International 
Cable TV and Satellite Reception Devices Fair opened yesterday 
in this, north China's biggest port city. 
  The four-day fair, aiming to promote the development of 
cable 
television technology and equipment, is the largest of its kind 
ever held in the country. 
  Some 19 overseas firms and 150 domestic companies are taking 
part in the fair. Nearly 1,000 items of cable TV equipment and 
satellite receiving devices are on display, including optical 
fiber transmission, multi-media communication and 
three-dimension image installations. 
  By the end of 1993 China had more than 20 million cable TV 
customers, accounting for 10 percent of the country's total 
number of television owners. 
  Analysts here predict that the number of cable TV sets will 
grow at the rate of 30 percent every year.
