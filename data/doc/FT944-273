FT  30 DEC 94 / US passes Japan in car output
The US has overtaken Japan this year to become the world's top motor vehicle
producer for the first time since 1979. According to Automotive News, the
authoritative US weekly, vehicle production in the US has risen by 13 per
cent this year to 12.28m from 10.87m in 1993. Vehicle output in Japan has
fallen by 2 per cent to 11m from 11.23m in 1993. Production in Japan has
fallen for four years in succession because of the domestic recession and
declining exports. New vehicle registrations in Japan have shown the first
signs of recovery in recent months, but for the full year vehicle output has
fallen to the lowest level for 12 years. Japanese vehicle production peaked
at 13.49m in 1990 after first overtaking the US in 1980.
The new ascendancy of the US as the world's leading vehicle producer owes
much to the far-reaching restructuring of the world vehicle industry that
has taken place in the past decade. Japanese vehicle producers themselves
have contributed greatly to the shifting balance with the transfer of more
and more production out of Japan during the past 10 years, first to North
America, and more recently to Europe and to south-east Asia.
