  [Text] A source of the Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) told 
EL PANAMA AMERICA yesterday that due to lack of evidence the 
Assistant Prosecutor's Office issued a precautionary measure 
[medida cautelar] in favor of the two Colombians arrested 
Thursday on suspicion of having participated in the attack on 
Jewish businessman Aaron Schwartz. 
  According to the source, after the situation of the 
Colombians was studied, they were freed because there was not 
enough evidence against them. Nevertheless, the two Colombians, 
whose names we omit because of the principle of presumption of 
innocence, are prohibited from leaving the country. These 
individuals told the Assistant Prosecutor's Office they were in 
Panama to buy automobiles. 
  On Thursday, the vehicle Schwartz was driving exploded and 
burned on Via Italia in the Paitilla neighborhood as a result of 
the explosion of a grenade connected to the front wheels of the 
vehicle. Schwartz suffered minor injuries to his arms and feet. 
  The Colombians were linked to the attack after an anonymous 
call reported their alleged participation in the incident. 
According to the source, the investigations have taken a new 
turn after data was gathered on the professionalism needed to 
place the grenade and the high cost of this type of work.
