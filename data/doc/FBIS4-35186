  [Text] During its meeting in Tunis last night, which lasted 
until late this morning, the Palestinian National Authority 
Council approved its draft political program, which emphasizes 
the end of occupation, particularly in the [West] Bank and the 
[Gaza] Strip. 
  A responsible Palestinian source said that the program also 
emphasizes the PLO's stand on the problem of Jerusalem, which is 
part of the territories that were occupied in 1967, and that the 
Council reiterates the National Authority's abidance by the 
resolutions of international legitimacy, specifically 
Resolutions 242 and 338. The source added that the program also 
stipulates the formation by the PLO Executive Committee of the 
National Authority and its institutions and that the PLO is the 
basic reference for the National Authority Council and the 
authority's institutions. 
  The Palestinian National Authority Council decided to take 
the constitutional oath before brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 
'Arafat], president of the state of Palestine, in the homeland 
following the return and after brother Abu-'Ammar is sworn in as 
chairman of the Council before brother Abu-al-Adib, Salim 
al-Za'nun, acting speaker of the Palestine National Council.
