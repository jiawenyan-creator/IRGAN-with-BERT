the dollar approximate separate transactions method of accounting (DASTM) to change its functional currency when
the local currency ceases to be hyperinflationary. These regulations provide rules for taxpayers to determine when
a change from DASTM is required and provide guidance on required adjustments relating to the change in method.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 985 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986. The proposed regulations would require a qualified business unit that uses the dollar approximate
separate transactions method to change its functional currency and its method of accounting to the profit and loss
method when the QBU is no longer operating in an environment that has a hyperinflationary currency. 


Explanation of Provisions 


Proposed 1.9851(b)(2)(ii)(E) provides that a QBU required to use the dollar as its functional currency
pursuant to 1.9851(b)(2) or a QBU that has elected to use the dollar as its functional currency pursuant
to 1.9852 must redetermine its functional currency if for three consecutive taxable years the currency
of the QBU's economic environment is not a hyperinflationary currency. The change in functional currency is treated
as made with the consent of the Commissioner, and the adjustments required under 1.9855 must be made
in connection with the change. 
The IRS believes it appropriate to require a QBU that is no longer operating in a hyperinflationary environment to
stop using the dollar to compute its income or loss or earnings and profits because of the general preference expressed
in section 985(b) to use the currency of the QBU's economic environment for this purpose. A three year measurement
period for determining non-hyperinflationary status was thought desirable to avoid frequent changes in functional
currency for QBUs operating in borderline hyperinflationary environments. Comments are requested as to whether
the three year period is appropriate. 


Special Analyses 


It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. 


Comments and Requests for a Public Hearing 


Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments
(preferably a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available
for public inspection and copying. A public hearing may be scheduled if requested in writing by a person that timely
submits written comments. If a public hearing is scheduled, notice of the date, time, and place for the hearing will
be published in the 

Federal Register

. 


Drafting Information 


The principal authors of these proposed regulations are Jacob Feldman and Teresa B. Hughes of the Office of Associate
Chief Counsel (International), within the Office of Chief Counsel, IRS. Other personnel from the IRS and Treasury
Department participated in their development.
