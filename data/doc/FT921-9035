FT  14 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Watching high blood pressure
CASIO Computer, of Japan, has developed a watch which enables wearers to
tell their blood pressure as well as the time. All the wearer needs to do is
place a finger on the watch and wait 30 seconds. Two sensors inside the
watch then measure the blood pressure.
The watch will go on sale in Japan later this month for Y19,000 (Pounds 85)
and worldwide sales are planned.
