LOCAL; 
SHUT-DOWN L.A. PORT REOPENS 
The port of Los Angeles, one of the nation's busiest, was reopened today after 
being closed down Wednesday night by a wildcat longshoreman's work stoppage 
that began when authorities tried to serve a warrant at a union hall, an 
official said. 
Both the harbor at San Pedro and adjoining Long Beach Harbor were operating as 
usual this morning as day-shift workers reported for work, a longshoremen's 
union spokeswoman said. 
The wildcat action, initially involving as many as 300 people, appeared to have 
had little effect because few ships are unloaded at night. 
The incident began about 5:30 p.m. when two investigators from the district 
attorney's office went to a union hall in Wilmington to serve an arrest warrant 
on a man wanted for failing to pay child support.
