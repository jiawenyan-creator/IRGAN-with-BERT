FT  15 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Trafalgar rocked by results
In spite of the dire warnings, results from Trafalgar House still managed to
shake the market as investors and analysts attempted to take in the scale of
the losses and provisions.
The final deficit for the year to September 30 was Pounds 347.2m, including
an exceptional charge of Pounds 397.3m. The dividend of 3.25p was as
forecast by the company at the time of its profits warning in October.
However, the company set the seal on the market's disappointment by stating
that the current-year dividend was unlikely to be above one penny.
All this, together with details of a Pounds 404m one-for-three rights offer
at 100p a share and a convertible issue as well, sent weary investors
rushing to sell. The shares came under immediate pressure and stayed that
way as talk of an angry post-results meeting filtered into the market. They
closed off the bottom but still 10 down at 77 1/2 p in heavy 30m turnover.
Dealers said the relative attractiveness of the convertible pointed to
further weakness ahead for the underlying stock.
It also raised the speculation further that Hong Kong Land, which holds a 25
per cent stake in Trafalgar, will embark on a full takeover.
