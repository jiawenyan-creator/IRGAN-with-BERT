Capital and Regional Properties reported sharply higher pre-tax profits for
the six months to June 24, during which just under Pounds 50m was spent on
acquisitions.
The USM-quoted property investment company raised the figure from Pounds
151,000 to Pounds 1.24m. This included a contribution of Pounds 281,000 from
R Green Properties, covering the 11 weeks since its acquisition for Pounds
33.4m in April, when a Pounds 25.3m rights issue was also completed.
Net rental income came to Pounds 2.95m (Pounds 3.38m). Other income added
Pounds 807,000 (Pounds 72,000) and the net interest charge declined to
Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 2.25m).
The interim dividend is raised to 0.6p (0.5p) on earnings per share of 2.85p
(0.2p).
Shareholders' funds at June 24 stood at Pounds 76.8m, against Pounds 49.6m
at December 25 1993. Net assets per share were 168.5p (163.8p at the year
end).
Mr Martin Barber, chairman, said Centrepoint Properties Corporation, the
former subsidiary now quoted separately in the US, had performed in line
with expectations. Capital and Regional owns 20 per cent of the common stock
in Centrepoint.
The company plans to move to the main market once the accounts for 1994 have
been published.
