SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The Department may revoke a countervailing duty order if the Secretary of Commerce concludes that it is no longer of
interest to interested parties. Accordingly, as required by 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4), we are notifying the public of our
intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on aluminum sulfate from Venezuela (54 FR 51908; December 19, 1989)
for which the Department has not received a request to conduct an administrative review for the most recent four consecutive
annual anniversary months. 

In accordance with section 355.25(d)(4)(iii) of the Department's regulations, if no domestic interested party
(defined in section 355.2(i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), and (i)(6) of the regulations) objects to the Department's intent
to revoke this order, and no interested party (defined in section 355.2(i) of the regulations) requests an administrative
review in accordance with the Department's notice of opportunity to request administrative review, we shall conclude
that the countervailing duty order is no longer of interest to interested parties and proceed with the revocation.
However, if an interested party does request an administrative review in accordance with the Department's notice
of opportunity to request administrative review, or a domestic interested party objects to the Department's intent
to revoke, the Department will not revoke the order. 



Opportunity To Object 



Not later than the last day of December 1994, domestic interested parties may object to the Department's intent to
revoke this countervailing duty order. Any submission objecting to revocation must contain the name and case number
of the order and a statement that explains how the objecting party qualifies as a domestic interested party under sections
355.2(i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), or (i)(6) of the Department's regulations. 

Seven copies of any such objections should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International
Trade Administration, Room B099, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230. 

This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(i).
