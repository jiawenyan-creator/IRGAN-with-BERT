  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 30 Dec (EFE) -- Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria today called on his country's guerrilla 
groups to renounce violence and seek new paths of dialogue and 
peace. In his end of the year message, Gaviria said: "I am 
speaking on behalf of more than 30 million Colombians in asking 
the violent ones in Colombia to put a halt to their deadly 
intentions, to give up their tragedy, and to return to a 
peaceful life." 
  The president said the country recovered confidence in 1993. 
He noted that he has aimed his efforts at strengthening and 
modernizing the state, at internationalizing the economy, at 
revitalizing justice, and at strengthening the capabilities of 
the Armed Forces. 
  In his final end of the year message as president of 
Colombia, Gaviria stated: "We have learned that nothing is the 
product of the efforts of a single moment, that all achievements 
are the fruit of sustained and collective efforts, and that 
victory is attained when the people place the nation's 
collective interests above their own personal interests." 
Gaviria also invited his fellow countrymen to participate in 
the political campaign and to listen to the proposals of all the 
presidential candidates.
