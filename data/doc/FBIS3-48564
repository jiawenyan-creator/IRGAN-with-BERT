  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 26 KYODO -- The ruling coalition 
parties agreed Wednesday to seek a consumer-oriented fiscal 1994 
budget designed to raise living standards while featuring 
measures to pull the economy out of recession, party officials 
said. The agreement, which came at a meeting of policy-makers 
from the seven parties in Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
coalition government, also calls for a third supplementary 
budget for fiscal 1994 to prop up the economy, they said. 
  But the parties stopped short of reaching a consensus on the 
issuance of deficit-financing government bonds to finance 
pump-priming measures. The budget-drafting platform did, 
however, agree upon the need to "pay attention to fiscal 
soundness." 
  The phrase is often used to underline the need to avoid 
raising government dependence on bonds for revenue, thereby 
issuing deficit-financing bonds. 
  Other key points in the platform are: 
  -- To review traditional ways to distribute government money 
and policy priorities. 
  -- To review ways to allocate funds to public works 
projects. 
  -- To give incentives to farmers and workers in the 
fisheries industry. 
  -- To show consideration to small and medium-size 
businesses. 
  -- To cope with the threat of AIDS and other 
health-related issues. 
  -- To try to achieve an effective defense force through 
moderation. 
  -- To rationalize subsidies and promote deregulation.
