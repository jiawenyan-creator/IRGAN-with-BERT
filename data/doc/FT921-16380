FT  04 JAN 92 / New Jewish settlement set up in Gaza
Jewish settlers in the occupied Gaza Strip yesterday established a new
settlement outside a Palestinian refugee camp in retaliation for the
shooting dead of one of their colleagues in an ambush by unidentified
Palestinian gunmen on Wednesday.
The dead man, Mr Doron Shorshan, was the fourth Israeli shot dead in the
West Bank and Gaza since October in a wave of attacks which have alarmed and
infuriated the 100,000-strong settler communities. Their leaders say they
will respond to every such killing with a new settlement. Hamas, a
Palestinian Islamic fundamentalist group, replied by urging Palestinians 'to
attack settlers everywhere'.
The latest settlement, comprised of three mobile homes, comes a few days
before Middle East peace talks are due to resume in Washington.
