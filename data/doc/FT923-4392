FT  07 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: 'Governors stand ready to intervene'
AT the conclusion of the meeting on September 5 of ministers and central
bank governors, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, said in a
statement:
'In the face of the tensions in the exchange markets the following decisions
have been taken.
I. The August 28 agreement not to proceed to a realignment in the European
Monetary System has been confirmed.
II. The governors stand ready to intervene in the exchange markets to
counter tensions in those markets, exploiting as fully as necessary the
means and instruments provided under the EMS for member states.
III. The ministers and governors have also examined the present economic
situation in the Community and in this context they emphasised the
importance of early and full implementation of strict convergence
programmes, in particular to consolidate fiscal positions and to keep under
control wage and other cost pressures. They particularly welcomed the recent
policy decisions by the Italian government, and its firm commitment to
achieve a substantial primary budget surplus in 1993.
IV. In the light of a slowing of the growth prospects of their economies,
and insofar as the disinflationary process allows it, they have decided to
take advantage of any opportunity to reduce interest rates. They welcomed
the fact that the Bundesbank in present circumstances has no intention to
increase rates and is watching the further development of the economy.'
