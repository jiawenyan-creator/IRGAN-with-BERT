FT  24 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
The zinc market was again in bullish mood, closing well ahead on the LME.
Three-month metal moved through expected resistance at Dollars 1,180 a
tonne, and one chartist said its target was now Dollars 1,200. The morning
rise was fuelled by speculative buying following Wednesday's constructive
close, coupled with trade and option covering. Three-month nickel moved
closer to Dollars 8,000 a tonne as the market absorbed the latest bout of
profit taking. London's dry cargo freight futures market took its lead from
a 15-point fall in the Baltic Freight Index, posting sharp losses in hectic
trade, dealers said. The index fall to 1,516 was bigger than expected and
some traders see the possibility of a renewed downturn although sentiment is
still constructive on stable panamax demand. 'People I talk to say it looks
relatively good, they're doing business and there are stronger panamax
fixtures in the Pacific,' one dealer said. On the bullion market platinum
moved ahead in response to an increasingly tight physical market reflected
in sharply higher lease rates. Platinum leasing rates have risen to around
eight-month highs, with nervous operators reluctant to roll over Russian
platinum swaps in response to Moscow's economic crisis.
