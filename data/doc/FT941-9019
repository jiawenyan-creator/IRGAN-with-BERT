FT  17 FEB 94 / Europe's creditors kept waiting
Two thirds of small- and medium-sized businesses in Europe report growing
delays in payment of debts and invoices, with the average waiting period
across Europe some 65 days, a new survey reveals, writes Gillian Tett in
Brussels. The survey says almost a quarter of small businesses say they wait
more than 90 days for payment, while almost 10 per cent wait around four
months. Worst affected is Italy, which has an average waiting period of 90
days, followed by Spain with 80 days. Sweden and Denmark have waiting
periods of 38 and 36 days respectively.
