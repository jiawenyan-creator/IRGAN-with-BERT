  [Text] The prime minister has said that the chemical 
weapons convention is a great step in the direction of 
disarmament and the most important pillar of any disarmament 
process is verification. Chairing the Consultative Committee 
meeting of the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers in New 
Delhi, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao said the Chemical Weapons 
Convention is nondiscriminatory in its approach. This is the 
reason for which the verification methods adopted in the 
convention are compared favorably with similar efforts in the 
direction of disarmament. Mr. Narasima Rao emphasized that 
India is not making any chemical weapons and it has nothing to 
hide. He said India plans to train its chemical industry in a 
such a way that they are able to protect their commercial 
secrets while undergoing the inspection process.
