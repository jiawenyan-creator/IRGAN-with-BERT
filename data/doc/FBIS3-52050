  [Text] Brussels, 24 January (PL) -- Ricardo Calderon, 
Cuban National Assembly president, met with European Parliament 
and government leaders on the first day of his visit to Belgium. 
  Alarcon's full schedule included an interview with Frank 
Swaelen, head of the Belgian Senate, to whom Alarcon expressed 
the great appreciation of the Cuban Government for Belgium's 
vote in favor of the UN resolution against the U.S. blockade of 
Cuba. 
  Alarcon also met with Enrique Baron, president of the 
European Parliament Foreign Relations Committee, to discuss an 
eventual agreement for cooperation between the European Union 
[EU] and Cuba. 
  Calderon also spoke with Andre Louis, vice president of 
Christian Democratic International, and with Wilfred Maartens, 
head of the European Peoples Party and the Christian Democratic 
European Union. 
  The participants of both meetings discussed the situation in 
Cuba -- especially the economic changes taking place on the 
island -- the U.S. blockade, and the role of Europe and the EU 
in Cuba's current situation. 
  The board of directors of the European Parliament's 
department responsible for relations with Central America, 
Mexico, and Cuba, hosted a dinner in Alarcon's honor later the 
same evening. 
  Ramon Pez Ferro, International Relations Commission 
secretary 
of the Cuban parliament, and Rosario Navas, Cuban ambassador to 
Belgium, also participated in today's meetings. 
  Alarcon arrived last night at the head of a Cuban delegation 
and will remain in Brussels until 30 January to meet with 
organizations that support Cuba. 
  As a result of these groups' initiative, Cuban Economist 
Carlos Tablada will host a conference on 29 January, and 
singer/composer Silvio Rodriguez will give a concert.
