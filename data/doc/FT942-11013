FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Royal Bank fund management talks
Royal Bank of Scotland is thought to be in talks with Newton Investment
Management on plans to merge their fund management operations.
Royal Bank would take a stake in the enlarged group, which would be managed
by Newton.
The company said yesterday that it was in discussions over 'possibilities
for co-operation in fund management' with Newton, but had 'no current plans'
to acquire an investment management business.
Royal Bank, which is due to announce its interim results next week, would
not comment further.
Royal Bank's Capital House Investments arm has about Pounds 5bn in funds
under management. However, the bank is thought to believe that combining
operations with Newton would be a more effective way of expanding than
outright acquisition.
Newton Investment Management, based in London, is a growing fund management
company with Pounds 5.17bn under management. Roughly Pounds 4bn of that is
pension scheme assets with the remainder in unit trusts for retail clients.
Newton has distinguished itself by superior performance in recent years and
in 1993 was the top-ranked firm among pension managers with a median
in-house return of 37.4 per cent according to figures compiled by Combined
Actuarial Performance Services. Among fund managers measured by CAPS, the
median return was 29.2 per cent.
According to data compiled by the Financial Times, Newton is also the top
performer among leading pension fund managers over the past five years. It
is the 17th largest pension fund manager in the UK.
Although its services are frequently recommended by pension fund consultants
who advise schemes, Newton has only resumed accepting new clients in April
after a two-year hiatus.
Capital House, meanwhile, is ranked 25th largest pension fund manager
according to an FT survey, with Pounds 4.8bn under management.
