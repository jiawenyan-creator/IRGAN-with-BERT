Simon Engineering yesterday announced a further move in its restructuring
with the sale of Simon-Macawber to Clyde Blowers for between Pounds 4m and
Pounds 4.45m, depending on net assets at completion. A further Pounds

Clyde is raising a net Pounds 5.2m by a 5-for-11 rights issue of 2.45m
shares at 237p. Its shares fell 15p to 290p.
Macawber makes pneumatic pressure and vacuum conveying systems. In 1993
trading profits were Pounds 350,000 on turnover of Pounds 11.9m. Net assets
