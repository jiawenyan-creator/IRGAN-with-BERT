FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Liability for CGT
MY WIFE and I sold our business at the end of 1988. This caused a liability
to CGT, which we paid. We then went abroad for a period.
In 1990, we returned to the UK and bought a property. This has been let
since September 1992.
Because of our investment in this, can we recover the CGT paid earlier?
If so, what liability do we incur for future CGT should we re-sell the
property?
The answer to your first question is no, as you will see from the free
pamphlet CGT11 (CGT and the small business), which is obtainable from your
tax office.
The chargeable gain on the eventual sale of the let property (assuming that
you never live there and also nominate it as your joint main residence) will
be based upon the actual cost, indexed from the month of the purchase
contract to the month of the sale contract (exchange of missives).
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CGT14 (capital gains tax - an
introduction) and CGT4 (owner-occupied houses).
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
