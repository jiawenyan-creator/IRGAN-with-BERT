P.M. BRIEFING; 
UAL STOCK SOARS OVER $7 A SHARE 
UAL Corp.'s stock soared more than $7 a share this morning on speculation that 
the parent of United Airlines may become a takeover target. 
The buying surge apparently was prompted by a report in USA Today that an 
investment group headed by Texas billionaire Robert Bass has acquired 2.5% to 
3% of UAL's stock. 
Susan Hawkins, a spokeswoman for Bass, declined comment on the report. UAL 
spokesman Joe Hopkins said the company will not comment on the stock activity. 
At noon on the New York Stock Exchange, UAL's stock was trading at $146.50 a 
share, up $7.25 from Monday's close. The jump followed gains of $1.75 on Monday 
and $15.50 last week.
