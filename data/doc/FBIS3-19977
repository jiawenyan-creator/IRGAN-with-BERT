  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- Of the countries of the 
collapsed East Bloc, only Poland, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, 
and Hungary are facing an economic upswing, in the view of 
Deutsche Bank Research. In Russia, the other CIS republics, 
Bulgaria, and Romania, on the other hand, the downward slide 
continues, the research subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG writes in 
an interim balance sheet of the reforms in East Europe that was 
presented in Frankfurt on Tuesday [22 March]. 
  Project head Otto Storf stressed that none of the East 
European countries has mastered the process of economic recovery 
-- not even those countries that have made most progress. 
Therefore, the upswing will not follow "a straight line" there, 
either. The Baltic states are on the right path. In almost all 
states the privatization of large companies proves to be 
difficult. However, if the process of improvement is delayed 
further out of concern for rising numbers of unemployed, 
unprofitable economic structures will be conserved. This will 
require all the greater sacrifices later on. At the same time, 
Storf appealed to the European Union to open its markets to the 
reform countries.
