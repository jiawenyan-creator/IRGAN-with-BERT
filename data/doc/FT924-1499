FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (6): Donor assistance essential - A
four-pronged strategy is relieving the burden of Dollars 7bn of debt
WITH an external debt at the end of 1991 in excess of Dollars 7bn, Zambia is
one of Africa's most debt-stressed economies. It has more debt per head of
population than any other country in the region.
It has since qualified for what are called 'enhanced Toronto' debt-relief
terms, offering a menu of options to creditors, including 50 per cent debt
forgiveness.
But Zambia's position is unique to the extent that not only does debt owed
to the multilaterals - the IMF, the World Bank and the African Development
Bank - (which technically cannot be rescheduled) make up 44 per cent of
long-term obligations, but it is also in arrears to the IMF to the tune of
Dollars 1.2bn. This makes it the IMF's second-largest arrears debtor after
Sudan.
The debt burden is less intimidating than the numbers (including a 65 per
cent debt-service ratio in 1992) imply. Zambia has - technically -
rescheduled the Dollars 1.2bn it owes the Fund through a Rights Accumulation
Programme whereby, as long as it meets IMF benchmarks, it accumulates
'rights' of SDR83.7m (Dollars 114.5m) a quarter, which go towards paying off
the arrears.
By March 1995 Zambia should have accumulated sufficient rights to clear its
IMF arrears thereby regaining access to Fund facilities. Once the arrears
are paid off, Zambia will become eligible for the highly concessional
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility giving it up to 10 years to repay
fresh IMF borrowings.
This is just one strand of a four-pronged external debt strategy. The others
include the July 1992 agreement with the Paris Club of official creditors at
which Lusaka obtained Dollars 927m of debt relief. Some Dollars 585m of this
took the form of 'enhanced concessions' while the balance of Dollars 343m
was 'extra-ordinary relief', by which is meant a deferment of payments.
Seven donor countries, including the UK, US and Germany, have so far agreed
to write off all, or some, of their development loans.
A third element is a proposed private and commercial debt buyback, although
this scheme is still in its infancy. The World Bank is offering Dollars 20m
and Zambia hopes to attract support from other donors giving it a cash chest
of Dollars 100m to buyback the Dollars 120m owed to the commercial banks and
other private debt.
The fourth leg of the strategy - new donor disbursements for project
financing - has proved disappointing. These are estimated at Dollars 200m in
1992, lower than in 1991 and well short of expectations. The problem is the
failure of line ministries to put together the bankable projects that donors
can support.
Before rescheduling, Zambia's 1992 debt-service bill was estimated at
Dollars 835m of which Dollars 269m was owned to the multilaterals, more than
half of it to the Fund and almost Dollars 500m to bilateral donors. Its
'enhanced Toronto' terms have reduced its Paris Club debt-service from more
than Dollars 450m to Dollars 45m this year and Dollars 55m in 1993.
Next year, Zambia is hoping for donor assistance of Dollars 1.4bn of which
Dollars 400m will take the form of debt relief, while the balance will be
Dollars 500m in balance of payments support, Dollars 200m in commodity aid
and Dollars 300m in project finance.
Without donor assistance, the balance of payments would be unmanageable with
an overall payments deficit averaging almost Dollars 650m in 1992/3. This is
largely a product of the debt situation, with pre-rescheduling interest
payments of over Dollars 300m in 1993 and capital repayments of a further
Dollars 365m.
Substantial donor help is crucial - to ease the debt burden and help build a
platform for the growth of non-traditional exports in the mid-1990s, without
which Zambia will remain at the mercy of the fortunes of the copper
industry.
