SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On June 30 and July 1, 1993, EPA's Design for the Environment Program sponsored an international meeting entitled
``Workshop on Identifying a Framework for the Future of Human Health and Environmental Risk Ranking.'' The workshop
was organized by a committee of representatives from government, industry, academia, and environmental groups.
The workshop's goal was to bring together the possible users of a ranking system, as well as people who have been working
on developing such decision making tools. Through information sharing on systems needs and current status of system
development, the workshop participants sought to identify actions which need to be taken to develop a ranking system
that meets the needs of many potential users. With this notice, EPA is announcing the availability of a document entitled
``Proceedings Document: Workshop on Identifying a Framework for the Future of Human Health and Environmental Risk
Ranking,'' detailing the presentations and discussions from the EPA workshop.
