FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Games Workshop scales down float
Games Workshop, a supplier of model war games systems, yesterday became the
latest casualty of investor unease towards new issues when its prospectus
revealed a scaling back of its forthcoming flotation.
The company had been aiming to raise Pounds 20m through a placing and free
float.
However, it now intends to raise just Pounds 12m, and only from
institutions. The reduction was blamed on the poor prevailing market
conditions, rather than investor reluctance to support such a unique
flotation.
The shares are to be priced at 115p, capitalising the company at Pounds 36m,
several million pounds below the level being touted by the board when the
flotation was first announ-ced at the beginning of September.
Dealings are due to begin on October 6.
The placing price represents an historic pro forma p/e ratio of 11.2 on
earnings per share of 10.3p for the year ended May 29 1994.
The notional gross dividend yield is 5 per cent.
The directors are forecasting operating profits of not less than Pounds 2.5m
for the six months to November 27 1994, compared with Pounds 2.1m and an
interim dividend of 1.5p per share to be paid in April 1995.
Games Workshop was the subject of a Pounds 10m managementbuy-out three years
ago. It designs, manufactures and markets futuristic war games complete with
figures and rules, which it then controls and supplements with developments.
The customers are predominantly male, between the ages of 10 and 17, who
keep up with the latest changes through the company's own magazine, White
Dwarf, which sells some 60,000 copies a month.
Most of the UK business is done through the group's network of 75 shops.
