FT  25 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Calling for growth
Sir Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, is fond of arguing that telecommunications
should not be lumped together with other privatised utilities. The
implication is that an exciting telecommunications company should be more
highly rated than a boring energy or water utility. The market believed that
story for a while in the early 1990s when BT's yield was roughly on a par
with the market's, but the stock's 20 per cent under-performance since
November means it is back in the same ball park as most other utilities.
The sharp derating of what is still by a whisker the London market's most
highly capitalised company owes much to an appreciation of how much
competition BT now faces. That is certainly a factor BT shares with other
non-utilities. The snag is that BT is now perceived to lack the compensating
advantage of many other non-utilities - the prospect of growth.
Is this perception fair? Certainly BT's management has done little to
disprove the doubters. Its international strategy, consisting largely of
splashing out billions of pounds on investments in the highly competitive US
market, has yet to produce a significant earnings stream outside the UK.
Equally, all the fine words from Mr Michael Hepher, group managing director,
about stimulating greater use of the domestic network have come to little.
Nevertheless, the growth opportunity is still there, even if BT is condemned
to see its market share decline. Britons use telecommunications much less
intensively than their American counterparts. If BT can tap this potential,
it will deserve a higher rating. But not until then.
