FT  12 OCT 92 / Graduate joblessness set to rise
GRADUATE unemployment has more than doubled since 1989, according to the
Institute of Manpower Studies.
In its annual review, the institute found that more than 10 per cent of
those who graduated last year were still unemployed six months after
completing their degrees, compared with 5 per cent in 1989.
The survey suggests that the unemployment rate among new graduates will
continue to rise next year and possibly in 1994, even if 'over-optimistic'
forecasts for economic recovery are borne out.
Social science and business studies graduates experienced the lowest rates
of unemployment last year, with humanities and maths graduates struggling
hardest to find work. Traditionally the lowest unemployment rate has been
among graduates in engineering and technology.
The study suggests that graduate salaries will not keep pace with inflation.
The median graduate starting salary is expected to increase by only 3.3 per
cent this year to Pounds 12,915.
The median salary for graduates with one year's experience is Pounds 13,500,
some 8 per cent higher than that for new graduates. Similarly, the median
salary for graduates with three years' experience is Pounds 16,500, or 32
per cent higher than the figure for new recruits.
The study shows that fewer than 24 per cent of new graduates found work in
the service sector in 1980. That figure peaked at 35 per cent in 1988 before
falling to less than 30 per cent as the service sector shrank. More than 30
per cent of new graduates now find jobs in industry, a slight decline on the
figure for 1980.
The proportion of graduates who say they are not available for work, 5.8 per
cent, has more than doubled since 1980, when the figure was 2.3 per cent.
The report says that is partly due to the number of graduates who have
dependants or are taking time off.
The survey confirms that mature students face disadvantages, mainly because
they perform badly in selection tests designed for traditional graduates as
employers seek, for example, to identify 'long-term potential' and
'ambition'.
