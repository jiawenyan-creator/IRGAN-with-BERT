MINERS' UNION FINED $13 MILLION IN STRIKE 
A judge fined the United Mine Workers union $13.5 million Monday for illegal 
strike activities in its lengthy contract dispute with the Pittston Coal Group. 
Elsewhere in Russell County, UMW members continued to occupy the control room 
of Pittston's main coal preparation plant, where they locked themselves in with 
padlocks and steel cables. Union leaders said the occupation, which began 
Sunday, would remain peaceful.
