FT  13 APR 92 / Unions face Bush offensive
PRESIDENT George Bush is to embark on a new policy which is expected to
weaken further the ailing US trade union movement. He plans to announce
today measures to implement a 1988 Supreme Court decision inhibiting trade
unions from using membership fees for political purposes.
The measures echo similar efforts undertaken by the UK's Conservative
government in the 1980s to curb British unions' use of political funds. This
could, in time, diminish a significant source of support for Mr Bush's
Democratic rivals, who are the overwhelming beneficiaries of organised
labour's backing.
The scope of the 1988 Supreme Court ruling on the case of Communications
Workers of America v Beck is limited, covering only workers who do not
belong to a union but who are required - as they may be in many states - to
pay dues because they receive union representation and are covered by a
union contract.
All the same, officials estimate that full implementation of the decision to
permit such workers to refuse to pay dues for political purposes could
reduce trade union funds by more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) a year.
Mr Bush's decision to act on the Beck ruling, four years after it was
delivered by the Supreme Court, demonstrates how the impending presidential
election has sharpened his administration's focus on policy issues.
Right-wing Republicans have urged the administration for some time to act on
the Beck ruling to curb unions' political muscle.
