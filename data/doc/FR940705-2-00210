 

Appendix KIIIB. Cultures of viable organisms containing recombinant DNA 
molecules shall be handled in a closed system (e.g., closed vessel used for the 
propagation and growth of cultures) or other primary containment equipment (e.g., 
biological safety cabinet containing a centrifuge used to process culture fluids) which 
is designed to reduce the potential for escape of viable organisms. Volumes less 
than 10 liters may be handled outside of a closed system or other primary 
containment equipment provided all physical containment requirements specified in 
Appendix GIIA are met. 
Appendix KIIIC. Culture fluids (except as allowed in Appendix KIIID) shall not 
be removed from a closed system or other primary containment equipment unless 
the viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules have been inactivated 
by a validated inactivation procedure. A validated inactivation procedure is one 
which has been demonstrated to be effective using the organism that will serve as 
the host for propagating the recombinant DNA molecules. 
Appendix KIIID. Sample collection from a closed system, the addition of 
materials to a closed system, and the transfer of culture fluids from one closed 
system to another shall be conducted in a manner which minimizes the release of 
aerosols or contamination of exposed surfaces. 
Appendix KIIIE. Exhaust gases removed from a closed system or other primary 
containment equipment shall be treated by filters which have efficiencies equivalent 
to high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters or by other equivalent procedures 
(e.g., incineration) to minimize the release of viable organisms containing 
recombinant DNA molecules to the environment. 
Appendix KIIIF. A closed system or other primary containment equipment that 
has contained viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules shall not be 
opened for maintenance or other purposes unless it has been sterilized by a 
validated sterilization procedure. A validated sterilization procedure is one which 
has been demonstrated to be effective using the organism that will serve as the host 
for propagating the recombinant DNA molecules. 
Appendix KIIIG. Emergency plans required by Sections IVB2b(6) and 
IVB3c(3) shall include methods and procedures for handling large losses of 
culture on an emergency basis. 


Appendix KIV. Biosafety Level 2 (BL2)_Large Scale 


Appendix KIVA. Spills and accidents which result in overt exposures to organisms 
containing recombinant DNA molecules are immediately reported to the Biological 
Safety Officer, Institutional Biosafety Committee, NIH/ORDA, and other 
appropriate authorities (if applicable). Reports to NIH/ORDA shall be sent to the 
Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, 
Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 4969838. Medical evaluation, 
surveillance, and treatment are provided as appropriate and written records are 
maintained. 
Appendix KIVB. Cultures of viable organisms containing recombinant DNA 
molecules shall be handled in a closed system (e.g., closed vessel used for the 
propagation and growth of cultures) or other primary containment equipment (e.g., 
Class III biological safety cabinet containing a centrifuge used to process culture 
fluids) which is designed to prevent the escape of viable organisms. Volumes less 
than 10 liters may be handled outside of a closed system or other primary 
containment equipment provided all physical containment requirements specified in 
Appendix GIIB are met. 
Appendix KIVC. Culture fluids (except as allowed in Appendix KIVD) shall not 
be removed from a closed system or other primary containment equipment unless 
the viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules have been inactivated 
by a validated inactivation procedure. A validated inactivation procedure is one 
which has been demonstrated to be effective using the organism that will serve as 
the host for propagating the recombinant DNA molecules. 
Appendix KIVD. Sample collection from a closed system, the addition of materials 
to a closed system, and the transfer of cultures fluids from one closed system to 
another shall be conducted in a manner which prevents the release of aerosols or 
contamination of exposed surfaces. 
Appendix KIVE. Exhaust gases removed from a closed system or other primary 
containment equipment shall be treated by filters which have efficiencies equivalent 
to high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters or by other equivalent procedures 
(e.g., incineration) to prevent the release of viable organisms containing 
recombinant DNA molecules to the environment. 
Appendix KIVF. A closed system or other primary containment equipment that 
has contained viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules shall not be 
opened for maintenance or other purposes unless it has been sterilized by a 
validated sterilization procedure. A validated sterilization procedure is one which 
has been demonstrated to be effective using the organisms that will serve as the host 
for propagating the recombinant DNA molecules. 
Appendix KIVG. Rotating seals and other mechanical devices directly associated 
with a closed system used for the propagation and growth of viable organisms 
containing recombinant DNA molecules shall be designed to prevent leakage or 
shall be fully enclosed in ventilated housings that are exhausted through filters which 
have efficiencies equivalent to high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters or 
through other equivalent treatment devices.
