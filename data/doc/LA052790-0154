CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SACRAMENTO; 
CUT WATER USE 10%, DEUKMEJIAN ORDERS 
Gov. George Deukmejian ordered all state agencies and departments to curtail 
water use by at least 10% to leave more for farming and firefighting. "As bad 
as things are in the state this year, we must also prepare for the possibility 
of a fifth straight year of drought," Deukmejian said in his weekly radio 
address. 
"If we do not conserve this year, next year we may have more severe water 
rationing, higher water prices and increased adverse economic and environmental 
consequences." His executive order directs department managers to seek ways of 
saving water, such as repairing leaks, limiting landscape irrigation, limiting 
washing of state cars and windows, eliminating washing of sidewalks and 
driveways and turning off decorative fountains. The drought, now in its fourth 
year, is expected to hurt farmers, particularly in the southern San Joaquin 
Valley, and cause losses in wildlife, fisheries and water-oriented recreation, 
he said.
