FT  23 APR 92 / Observer: Bain's verdict
Meanwhile, yesterday's letter in the FT on the same subject from Professor
Andrew Bain rang a bell. As an old Midland Bank hand - he was group economic
adviser - he could be expected to peddle the party line on how terrible a
Lloyds Bank takeover would be.
Nevertheless, as he has sat on both the Wilson committee on the City and the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, his views should still command respect.
Indeed, he resigned from the MMC after the Government over-ruled its
decision turning down Charter's bid for Anderson Strathclyde.
Bain is convinced that a Lloyds' bid would be referred to the MMC. The
Office of Fair Trading would lose all credibility if it wasn't. He's also
convinced that the MMC would turn it down.
