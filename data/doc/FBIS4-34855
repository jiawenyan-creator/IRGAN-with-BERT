  [Text] In Toronto, the Canadian (Cherris) Company has 
announced that it will create a joint enterprise with Cuban 
Nickel Enterprise for mining nickel and cobalt in Cuba. 
  The new enterprise includes others that will be directly in 
charge of the extraction, refining, and global marketing of 
nickel and cobalt. The Cuban Government has granted the new 
entity a mining claim comprising more than 60 million tons of 
iron oxide ore with nickel, with an 80 percent concentration of 
the reserves tested.
