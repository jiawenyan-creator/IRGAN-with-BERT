FT  26 MAR 92 / Computer guidebook launched by EC
A guidebook to help EC public sector procurement officials cope with the
maze of standards for 'open systems' computer and telecom equipment will be
launched in Brussels today, writes Paul Taylor. 'Open systems' are designed
to work easily with similar systems made by other manufacturers, unlike
proprietary systems which are difficult to link. EC states spend more than
Ecu600bn (Pounds 430bn) a year on public procurement.
