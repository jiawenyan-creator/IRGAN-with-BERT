<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk by </F>
unidentified correspondent at ceremony to open a new children's 
clinic in Kiev on 19 April; -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, the paradoxes 
in life today are endless, are they not? Today, the Russian 
press publishes materials on the intention of Ukraine to capture 
Kuban and develop new types of mass destruction weapons, while 
the Ukrainian president is opening a clinic for children. 
  [Kravchuk, laughing] You said it yourself and this is 
paradoxical indeed. Paradoxes in the press -- in this case in 
some of the Russian newspapers -- are, unfortunately, 
paradoxical indeed. I have read this publication today and I am 
under the impression that this is a kind of myth. Somebody 
thought: Why not create a myth? So this myth is being passed 
off as some reality. 
  I can tell you right out that nobody has issued any 
instructions for missiles to be retargeted, neither the 
president nor the Defense Council nor other state structures of 
ours. It has not even crossed our minds. As they say, it is 
only imaginative writing presenting it as reality. 
  Nor is there, was there, will there, or can there be any 
development of any mass destruction weapons, because in general 
we as a state have been against mass destruction weapons right 
from the outset. We have no chemical or bacteriological 
weapons, and we as a state have determined our position with 
regard to eliminating nuclear weapons. 
  The impression is, you know, that this is some kind of 
unhealthy perception of Ukraine and I can say no more. I would 
just like to say that this is simply a myth. [passage omitted]
