  [Text] Moscow, April 29, RIA -- The Democratic Russia 
movement intends to become a party of the same name, initiators 
of the organising committee of a federal party, movement 
co-chairmen Lev Ponomarev and Gleb Yakunin said today. 
  Ponomarev told a RIA correspondent by telephone that the two 
other co-chairmen of the movement -- Ilya Zaslavskiy and 
Grigoriy Tomchin -- joined Yegor Gaydar's newly created party 
Russia's Choice, while the position of the fifth co-chairwoman 
-- Galina Starovoitova -- remains unknown because she is abroad. 
  The split, says a statement issued by Ponomarev and Yakunin 
today, was caused by the fact that Democratic Russia does not 
want to become an organisation arranging mass actions for the 
Russia's Choice party, as the Soviet trade unions did for the 
CPSU. 
  In Ponomarev's view, "in three to four months it will be 
possible to think of registering the party, but before that a 
lot of work has to be done in the regions". 
  "The Democratic Russia party will be a rival to Gaydar's 
Russia's Choice, but we do not expect ideological differences 
between the two related parties," noted Ponomarev.
