  [Text] In a serious violation of Egyptian sovereignty, 
members of the U.S. Embassy last week inspected oil equipment in 
Alexandria and the Red Sea that the government has recently 
imported. They claim that the Egyptian Government has shipped 
to the Libyan Jamahiriyah imported oil equipment worth more than 
$75 million. 
  The U.S. action caused displeasure in several Egyptian 
circles, which confirmed reports in this regard. They 
emphasized that the U.S. Embassy's inspection of some oil and 
other industrial equipment is unacceptable and constitutes a 
violation of Egyptian sovereignty. 
  The United States has threatened to suspend some deals, 
including deals involving oil equipment, already concluded with 
the Egyptian Government. It has also threatened to impose 
economic sanctions against Egypt following U.S. reports that 
Egypt has allegedly violated the UN economic sanctions against 
Libya. The United States claims that various U.S. agencies have 
detected about 560 Egyptian violations of the UN economic 
sanctions against Libya. It also claims that there are existing 
trade exchanges between the two countries, that large quantities 
of Egyptian-made and imported products go to Libya, and that 
about 800 Egyptian businessmen have visited Libya and about 
1,500 Libyan businessmen visited Egypt to promote trade between 
the two countries. 
  In light of this, the U.S. State Department has asked the 
U.S. Embassy in Cairo to check on the extent of the Egyptian 
Government's adherence to the economic sanctions against Libya 
and to file a weekly report on the matter.
