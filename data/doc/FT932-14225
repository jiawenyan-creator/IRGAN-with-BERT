FT  20 APR 93 / Observer: Herd class
How does the word's most powerful transport minister travel the world? When
Federico Pena, the US secretary of transportation, returns home today after
talks in London with his UK opposite number, he will be travelling the same
way as he arrived - by economy class, albeit on an American-owned and built
jumbo.
Pena, like his boss, is said to be very sensitive about spending taxpayers'
money. But these sorts of PR gimmicks rarely survive for long - so Observer
is offering a bottle of the finest malt whisky for the first recorded
sighting of Pena travelling in any style other than economy.
