Stock, $1.00 Par Value) File No. 15353</DOCTITLE>


May 19, 1994.


Teleflex Incorporated (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d22(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:
According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on April 28, 1994
and concurrently therewith such securities were suspended from trading on the Amex.
In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant on maintaining the dual listing of its securities on the NYSE and the Amex. The
Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its common stock and believes that dual listing
would fragment the market therefor.
Any interested person may, on or before June 10, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.
