  [Text] [Dubon] Congress President Marco Villar Anleu has 
disclosed his position and Congress' regarding the results of 
the referendum. 
  [Villar Anleu] We want to tell Guatemalans and the media 
that 
Congress views with satisfaction the results obtained in the 30 
January referendum. We also want to express our concern over 
the high rate of abstention registered at the polls. Although 
we had anticipated some abstention, the rate was higher than 
what we had expected. This high rate of abstention was due to 
many reasons, such as the trend adopted by Guatemalans to 
refrain from participating, and a lack of civic spirit during 
past electoral events. 
  We are concerned greatly by an abstention rate of 
approximately 84 percent, and I believe the political sector 
must play a significant role in this regard. Had the political 
institutions participated effectively and actively, the 
percentage might have been different; in this sense, the 
referendum was a process in which Guatemalans participated 
conscientiously, without any influence from political parties. 
  [Dubon] Villar Anleu has said Congress will respect the 
Guatemalans' decision to ratify the reforms, but he spotlighted 
the fact these reforms had been ratified by only 10 percent of 
all eligible voters; this, he said, could deprive the results of 
their legitimacy. 
  He has urged all sectors to sit at the negotiation table to 
dialogue and reach an agreement of practicality so that the 
coming congressional elections are conducted within a legal 
framework.
