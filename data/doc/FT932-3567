FT  14 JUN 93 / Scottish rebuff for Labour leader
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, suffered a further setback yesterday in
his efforts to introduce one-member-one-vote reforms for his party's voting
structure.
The party's Scottish executive, meeting in Edinburgh, voted heavily against
Mr Smith's proposals and called for Labour to retain a 'collective union
voice'.
