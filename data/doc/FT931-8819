FT  17 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Row over drug information bill
THE government was last night accused of trying to 'wreck' a bill on
increasing the information available on medicines - in spite of previously
indicating some support for the measure.
Mr Giles Radice, Labour MP for Durham North, said ministers were mounting a
'shabby and cynical' exercise aimed at undermining his Medicines Information
Bill.
