FT  31 OCT 94 / Arts: (Openings): Saint-Etienne
Admirers of French composer Jules Massenet will be flocking to the city of
his birth on Friday for a rare staging of 'Panurge', his Rabelais-inspired
operatic comedy. It forms the centrepiece of this year's Massenet Festival,
which also includes concert performances of 'Le Cid', recitals by young
French singers and a special Massenet exhibition. The driving force behind
the festival is the conductor Patrick Fournillier.
