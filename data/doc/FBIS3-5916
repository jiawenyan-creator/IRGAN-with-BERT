  [Text] Seoul, March 11 (YONHAP) -- South Korean and U.S. 
officials agreed Friday that the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) inspections of North Korean facilities are going 
well enough not to cause any undue concern. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and visiting U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of State Robert Gallucci met privately after officials 
from the two sides had sat down to three hours of talks on 
resolving the North Korean nuclear problem. 
  "They (Han and Gallucci) noted that the IAEA inspections are 
under way. The inspection issue was not discussed as a matter 
of concern," Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said after 
the meeting. 
  The two officials' judgement soft-pedaled unceasing reports 
that IAEA activities are being limited by North Korea, which is 
refusing full access to certain key installations. 
  Chang said they discussed two scenarios if the third round 
of 
North Korea-U.S. high-level talks either does or doesn't open on 
March 21. 
  Gallucci, chief U.S. representative at the high-level talks 
with North Korea, is in Seoul to work out a joint response to 
the nuclear situation. 
  He and the foreign minister will meet again over lunch on 
Saturday and evaluate the results of the sixth inter-Korean 
contact on exchanging special envoys, Chang said. 
  The envoy exchange is one of two preconditions to North 
Korea-U.S. high-level negotiations. The other is successful 
conclusion of the IAEA inspections.
