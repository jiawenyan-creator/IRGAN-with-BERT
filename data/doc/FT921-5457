FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Young Grp shares dive after profit warning
YOUNG GROUP, the opencast and drift coal miner, yesterday announced that its
profits for the year to November 30 1991 were likely to be substantially
lower than expected, and that its directors have recommended no final
dividend be paid.
The announcement coincided with the reinstatement of dealing in the group's
shares, suspended on February 18 at 96p. The shares slumped to 27p, but
rallied slightly to finish the day at 39p.
In a statement issued by Lazards, its financial adviser, the USM-quoted
company, which has sites in the UK and Venezuela, said it had suffered a
shortfall in 'economically extractable reserves' at some of its opencast
sites, resulting in increased per-tonne extraction costs and reduced
profitability.
It is understood that geological problems, including underground combustion
and smaller than anticipated reserves, have hit production at several sites,
denting profitability. The geological setback, although coincidental with
the current depressed price for coal, means the County Durham-based group is
faced with developing new sites at a time when prices are sliding.
The statement said lost production and the costs of developing new sites
while restoring exhausted ones, meant additional working capital was
required. A short term facility had been arranged with shareholders' support
and discussions are continuing with NatWest, the group's bankers, and
shareholders to arrange additional finance.
Barely two months ago, the group successfully raised Pounds 5.4m net by the
issue of 5.71m convertible preference shares, gaining 3i and Hambro European
Ventures as shareholders and reducing gearing below 100 per cent.
Last summer, shortly before declaring interim pre-tax profits of Pounds
756,000, Mr Young voiced hopes of boosting coal production from 774,000
tonnes in 1990 to 1m tonnes within three years. But 1991 production will be
below the previous year.
