  [Text] The U.S. believes that Latvia and Russia must 
conclude an agreement on the operation of radar in the village 
of Skrunda and on the term of its utilization by Russia, says 
the press release highlighting the results of the visit to 
Washington by a Latvian delegation led by Latvian Foreign 
Minister Georgs Andrejevs. 
  Among the Russia-advanced terms for the withdrawal of about 
13,000 Russian servicemen from Latvia by August 31, 1994, is 
holding on to the early-warning radar during the next five 
years. Latvia has agreed to 3 years and to the radar's 
dismantling during one more year. The absence of compromise is 
the stumbling block hampering the bilateral talks. 
  The press release also says that in the U.S. Latvian 
deputies 
and diplomats met with President Bill Clinton, Vice President 
Albert Gore, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 
Under-Secretary of State Strobe Talbott [title as received], and 
representatives of the National Security Council, the Pentagon 
and other officials. 
  The talks concentrated on the Latvian-Russian talks, on 
Latvia's participation in the Partnership for Peace program, on 
European security and on ways of broadening military cooperation 
between Latvia and the U.S..
