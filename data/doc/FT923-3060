FT  15 SEP 92 / Health Department blocks vaccines
THE Department of Health has stopped using three of SmithKline Beecham's
vaccines for children because of potentially dangerous side effects, the
company said last night.
The department's decision is a blow for SmithKline Beecham, the
Anglo-American drugs group, which has been expanding its vaccine business.
The vaccine industry had previously been constrained by the risk of legal
action in the event of side effects. However, recent US legal decisions have
concluded that benefits outweigh the risk of vaccinations.
The immediate financial impact of the move is minimal, however. The vaccines
had annual global sales of Pounds 15m.
The vaccines, called Pluserix, Paviorix and Rimparix, are used to inoculate
babies at about 15 months against measles, mumps and rubella, but can cause
a mild form of meningitis, it has emerged.
A study in Nottingham found the strain of mumps used in the vaccines, known
as the Urabe strain, can cause meningitis in one in every 11,000 children
vaccinated. It had previously been thought the rate of meningitis
attributable to the vaccines was one in 100,000.
Institut Merieux of France and Sclavo of Italy also use the Urabe strain in
their vaccines. Doctors in the UK are being advised to use an alternative
vaccine manufactured by Merck.
SmithKline Beecham said it was in discussions with other national health
authorities about the safety of the medicines. The Irish health authorities
last week decided to stop using vaccines with the Urabe strain.
SmithKline Beecham insisted no deaths had been caused by the vaccine-induced
meningitis. More than 35m doses had been administered in 70 countries, it
added.
The Health Department said the risks of contracting vaccine-related
meningitis were extremely small, and immunisation benefits, whichever
vaccine was used, were overwhelming. Any parents whose children had recently
been vaccinated should contact their doctor if they were concerned.
