  [Text] [Announcer] Good evening. It's Angeles Bazan here. 
Once more the Luis Roldan case will take up most of our 
half-hour program of news and current affairs. The government 
will appear before the plenum of the Congress of Deputies 
Wednesday [11 May] next week. Over the last few hours some 
political parties have made sure that the appeal for 
explanations has become a real outcry. 
  There are ever more people asking for Felipe Gonzalez to 
explain to the public the current social and political upheaval. 
  The government has decided to respond to the request for an 
appearance. It will be next Wednesday at 1600. However, it is 
still not known whether Felipe Gonzalez himself will give 
explanations to the chamber. 
  Meanwhile the search for Luis Roldan continues, and no one 
knows where he is. Today new alleged irregularities came to 
light. On the one hand it emerged that he took 60 million 
pesetas of the School for Orphans of the Civil Guard and on the 
other hand, his 1992 tax return has been made public, for which 
the Treasury had to give him more than 3 million pesetas. 
  The minister of economics and finance has said that Roldan 
was being investigated before he stepped down, but he did not 
say what the result of the investigation was.
