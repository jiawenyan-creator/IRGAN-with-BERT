FT  12 JAN 94 / Labour raps curb on council report
The suppression of a district auditor's report into alleged electoral
manipulation by Westminster City Council is an 'appalling denial of public
information,' Labour said yesterday.
The government is braced for bad news in the report, which was to have been
published tomorrow by Mr John Magill, the district auditor, after an
investigation lasting four years.
However, Mr Magill said publication had been abandoned 'for legal reasons.'
Circulation will be restricted to 12 ratepayers who triggered the inquiry
and 30 'respondents'.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, said that the district
auditor's ruling was 'an absurd decision that cannot hold'.
Westminster council also condemned the decision.
Mr Magill is investigating claims that the Conservative controlled council
misused ratepayers' funds by selling flats in marginal wards to Conservative
supporters.
Labour says an influx of homeowners helped the Conservatives to win 45 of
the council's 60 seats in the last elections, held in 1990. That compares
with 32 Tory seats in 1989.
The inquiry has focused on councillors and officials involved in the sale of
council flats, including Dame Shirley Porter and Mr David Weeks, who are
both former leaders of the council, and Mr Barry Legg, the Conservative
group's former chief whip. Mr Legg is now Conservative MP for Milton Keynes
South West.
The auditor has the power to recommend that the councillors involved should
be surcharged if he decides that the council's actions were unlawful.
The conclusions of the report will be closely monitored by the Conservative
party, which presented Westminster council as an example to other local
authorities during the late 1980s.
