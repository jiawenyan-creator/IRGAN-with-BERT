SOUTH ROUNDUP; 
MONTGOMERY, DEFENSE LEAD NORTH CAROLINA STATE, 38-28 
North Carolina State quarterback Shane Montgomery completed 25 of 40 passes for 
268 yards and three touchdowns and ran for another to lead the Wolfpack over 
the Yellow Jackets, 38-28, Saturday in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at 
Raleigh, N.C. 
The Wolfpack (2-0), despite committing turnovers on their first two 
possessions, led, 17-7, at halftime as Montgomery scored on a four-yard run and 
threw a five-yard touchdown pass to Todd Varn. 
Montgomery's third touchdown pass, a four-yarder to Mike Kavulic, followed the 
last of Georgia Tech's six turnovers and gave the Wolfpack a 38-28 lead. 
Georgia Tech, trying to win its first ACC game in two seasons, has lost 19 of 
its last 20 games against Division I-A opponents. 
The Yellow Jackets trailed, 17-14, in the third quarter when Ken Swilling 
intercepted a pass and returned it 95 yards for a touchdown. 
After North Carolina State reserve tailback Tyrone Jackson scored on a 
three-yard run, Georgia Tech took advantage of a poor snap and Preston Poag's 
punt of minus-three yards and drove 47 yards to close to 24-21 on Shawn Jones' 
five-yard touchdown pass to Jerry Mays. 
North Carolina State made it 31-21 on Montgomery's second touchdown pass, a 
21-yarder to Chris Williams with 12:26 left. 
But T.J. Edwards' 41-yard kickoff return set up Mays' 13-yard touchdown run 
that brought the Yellow Jackets to within 31-28 with 9:46 left. 
Barry Anderson recovered a Georgia Tech fumble at the Yellow Jacket 32 to set 
up Montgomery's touchdown pass to Kavulic. 
"The thing that probably surprised me the most was that we really didn't play 
that well defensively," Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Ross said. "Offensively, we 
made some mistakes, but I thought we kept fighting and coming back. It wasn't a 
real pretty game." 
North Carolina 49, VMI 7 -- Jonathan Hall completed 13 of 24 passes for 167 
yards and two touchdowns to lead the Tar Heels over over the Keydets at Chapel 
Hill, N.C. 
Eric Blout ran for 102 of the Tar Heels' 318 rushing yards and also scored two 
touchdowns, one on a 33-yard run. 
North Carolina, which led, 28-0, at halftime, is 1-0. VMI 0-2. 
Tulane 20, Rice 19 -- Deron Smith threw to Michael Pierce on an 18-yard 
pass-play touchdown in the fourth quarter to give the Green Wave a victory over 
the Owls at New Orleans. Both teams are 1-1. 
The winning touchdown was set up by Mitchell Price, who intercepted a pass by 
Donald Hollas at the Rice 35-yard line and returned it 12 yards. 
Two running plays picked up six yards, and then Smith hit Pierce on third down. 
South Carolina 17, Virginia Tech 17 -- Collin Mackie kicked a 33-yard field 
goal with 52 seconds left to give the Gamecocks a tie with the Hokies at 
Columbia, S.C. 
Appalachian St. 15, Wake Forest 10 -- Cornerback Keith Collins recovered a 
fumble and intercepted a pass -- both in the end zone in the second half -- to 
preserve a victory for the Mountaineers over the Demon Deacons at 
Winston-Salem, N.C.
