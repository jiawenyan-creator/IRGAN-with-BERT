 



Greatest Economic Need.

 Section 502(b)(1)(M) of the OAA, as amended by section 501(2)(A) of the 1992 Act, requires that SCSEP recipients and
subrecipients serve individuals with low income at or below the poverty line.


Dual Eligibility.

 Section 510 of the OAA, as added by section 506 of the 1992 Act, makes SCSEP enrollees eligible for programs under section
203 of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) where projects are jointly carried out under the two programs.


Assessment.

 Section 502(b)(1)(N) of the OAA, as added by section 501(2) (B) and (C) of the 1992 Act, requires an analysis of an enrollee's
skills, talents, need for supportive service(s) and physical capabilities. It also provides for employment counseling
based on strategies that identify appropriate employment objectives and progress in meeting such objectives or
an equivalent assessment under another employment or training program.







Consultation/Coordination




Consultation with Area Agencies on Aging.

 Section 502(d)(1) of the OAA, as amended by section 501(4) of the 1992 Act, requires SCSEP recipients and subrecipients
to consult with the local area agency on aging in the planning and service areas in localities where a SCSEP project
is to be located. This is in addition to the existing requirement that SCSEP recipients and subrecipients submit a
description of the project to the State agency 30 days prior to undertaking the project.


Coordination with Administration on Aging.

 Section 503(a)(2) and (b)(1) of the OAA, as amended by section 502(a)(3) and (b) of the 1992 Act, requires the Department
of Labor to coordinate the administration of the SCSEP program with the other titles of the Older Americans Act in the
areas of support and nutrition service, training, research and demonstrations, and grants to Native Americans.
Such coordination is required in order to increase the likelihood that SCSEP enrollees receive services authorized
by the Older Americans Act and to increase job opportunities for them.


Coordination with Job Training Programs.

 Sections 502(e)(2)(C) and 505(d) (1) and (2) of the OAA, as added by sections 501(5)(D) and 503(2) of the 1992 Act, require
the Department of Labor to promote and coordinate SCSEP projects with other programs, projects, or activities under
other Acts that provide training and employment opportunities to eligible individuals.


III. Proposed Regulatory Changes by Section


The regulations for the SCSEP are currently at 29 CFR part 89. As part of the process of consolidating all of the ETA program
regulations into 20 CFR chapter V, the Department is redesignating the regulations at 29 CFR part 89 as 20 CFR part 641
and revising the regulations as discussed below. See the redesignation table at the end of this summary. The section
number references are to the redesignated sections.


A. Recent Statutory Amendments


The following is a discussion of changes made in response to the amendments contained in Pub. L. 102375.


Part 641


1. Section 641.102 includes new definitions for area agency on aging, disability (consistent with section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and 29 CFR parts 32 and 34), dual eligibility, greatest economic need, greatest social
need, individual development plan, JTPA, poor employment prospects, reallotment, and subrecipient. These new
definitions are intended to provide clarifications consistent with the 1992 Act's amendments to the Older Americans
Act and administrative requirements.
2. Section 641.201 is amended to add hearings to assist in understanding the allotment process; it also adds provisions
for within-State apportionment factors, including greatest economic need and greatest social need.
3. Section 641.205 is amended to reformat and streamline the regulation.
4. Section 641.302 is amended by: adding ``greatest economic need'' as a factor to be considered by the recipient and
subrecipient under their grants for serving specific needs; adding language to acknowledge the need for the recipient
and subrecipient to monitor the projects and subprojects; adding language to acknowledge the need for documentation
to support enrollment and continuing eligibility determinations based on concerns raised by the Department of Labor's
Office of the Inspector General; and reinforcing the need to provide equitable services.
5. Section 641.303 is amended by: substituting ``recipient or subrecipient'' for ``project sponsor''; revising
paragraph (b)(2) to incorporate the need for establishing cooperative relationships to obtain supportive services
under other titles of the Older Americans Act as the first approach used; adding paragraph (b)(3) to address the need
to develop cooperative relationships with other employment and training organizations, including JTPA and Carl
D. Perkins Act programs; adding paragraph (b)(4) to emphasize the need for cooperative relations with the employment
security agency; and adding paragraph (b)(5) to ensure consultations and sharing of project descriptions among
the recipients, subrecipients and the affected area agency on aging.
6. Section 641.305, at paragraphs (a) and (b), is amended to clearly state the three regulatory issues when eligibility
criteria must be employed; a new paragraph (d) is added, consistent with 20 CFR 628.605(e)(3) of the JTPA Interim Final
Regulations issued December 29, 1992, 57 FR 62004, to incorporate the dual eligibility provisions of section 510
of the OAA, as added by section 506 of the 1992 Act; and paragraph (e) is added to clearly address varying situations
dealing with termination of enrollees.
7. Section 641.306 is amended by adding ``eligible individuals with the greatest economic need'' as the first enrollment
priority; 641.306(b) establishes a preference for persons with poor employment prospects within the priorities;
and 641.306(c) is added to clarify that priorities only apply to vacant positions. Provisions regarding additional
priorities have been dropped and provisions regarding conversions to permanent enrollment status are found in 641.318
