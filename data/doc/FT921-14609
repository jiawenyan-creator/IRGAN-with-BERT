FT  15 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Many zinc mines 'are operating
at a loss'
BETWEEN 35 and 45 per cent of zinc mine capacity is not covering its
operating costs at present low prices and many zinc smelters are not
profitable, according to Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal
Dutch/Shell group.
So it seems logical that more high-cost mines should close this year and
that more smelter shut-downs must be expected, it suggests in a special
report on the zinc market.
Zinc production in western Europe, which fell from a peak of 1.14m tonnes in
1985 to about 950,000 tonnes in 1990, is expected to drop again.
Metallgesellschaft is to close its Meggen mine in March and this will
effectively bring an end to zinc mining in Germany, the report points out.
However, mine and smelter cuts will not be implemented quickly enough to
return the market to balance before well into next year and 1992 should see
another supply surplus, say the authors, Ms Karen Norton and Mr Angus
MacMillan.
They suggest the estimated supply surplus of 175,000 tonnes last year will
ease to 105,000 tonnes in 1992 and change to a 70,000 tonnes deficit in
1993.
Consequently, average London Metal Exchange zinc cash prices are likely to
average 48 cents a lb in the second quarter of 1992 before picking up to
average 58 cents in the final quarter. For this year as a whole, zinc is
seen averaging 52 cents against 50.7 cents a lb in 1991, rising to an
average of 60 cents in 1993.
Output of refined lead outside the old eastern bloc countries is forecast to
slip from an estimated 5.275m tonnes last year to 5.125m tonnes in 1992
before recovering to 5.2m tonnes next year. Consumption is estimated at 5.2m
tonnes for 1991 and forecast to ease to 5.1m tonnes this year and rise to
5.35m tonnes in 1993.
Looking further ahead, the report says zinc demand should enjoy a period of
reasonable growth in the 1990s and envisages an underlying rate of 1.5 to 2
per cent a year during the present decade.
