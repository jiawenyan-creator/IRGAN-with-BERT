FT  31 DEC 94 / Reform of quango recruitment urged
The government should surrender its powers of appointment to public bodies
to an independent commission or parliamentary select committee, the British
Medical Association said yesterday.
There has been considerable criticism of appointments to bodies which run
the National Health Service at local level. The government has been accused
of favouring Tory party members, supporters of free-market economics and
people with business rather than health backgrounds.
There have also been complaints that the 1991 NHS reforms have made health
authorities less accountable to the public by removing local authority
representatives.
In a discussion paper, the medical association acknowledges that the
centralised NHS has 'never been a model of local democratic accountability
comparable with local authorities' but says that, in the past, the
authorities responsible for local decisions - though unelected - had public
confidence.
In 1994 a committee was set up to advise on appointments to Scottish health
boards after concerns about accountability.
Yesterday's paper says: 'We suggest that this development, which still
leaves the final decision with the secretary of state, be taken one stage
further and that responsibility for appointments. . . be given to an
independent commission, or placed under the jurisdiction of a body such as a
select committee.'
