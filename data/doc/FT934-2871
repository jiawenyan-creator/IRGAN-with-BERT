FT  11 DEC 93 / Nuclear group mounts policy drive
Scottish Nuclear, the state-owned utility, yesterday risked the wrath of the
government by launching a high-profile campaign promoting an energy policy
which 'balances the merits of the market with long-term sustainability'.
The campaign, involving newspaper advertisements and the mailing to MPs and
large companies of a 20-page document, comes as the government prepares to
publish the terms of its long-promised review of the nuclear industry.
Ministers are likely to view the campaign as an attack on their stated
policy of relying on market forces to determine the sort of energy Britain
uses.
The launch of Scottish Nuclear's campaign comes just two weeks after the
government rebuked Nuclear Electric for pressing for privatisation of the
industry.
Mr James Hann, Scottish Nuclear chairman, said yesterday that the market
framework needed to be adjusted to consider long-term energy concerns
arising from population growth and global warming.
He said there was a danger that the UK would become too reliant on gas for
its energy needs, with a steady decline in nuclear, coal and renewable
electricity generation.
Gas prices were likely to rise as a result, but by then it could be too late
to go back to coal or nuclear generation.
Scottish Nuclear is advocating an 'independent and accountable energy agency
with the task of formulating and implementing a long-term energy strategy'.
It suggests a 'capacity auctions' system by which bidders would be invited
to submit tenders to build particular types of generation plant. Potential
bidders could involve both the private and public sectors.
