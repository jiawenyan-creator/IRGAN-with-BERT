 

However, with respect to timely processing of amendments, the general rule is that a statutory or regulatory time
period for agency action is not mandatory unless it specifies a consequence for the agency's failure to meet the prescribed
deadline. Where no such consequence is specified, the time period is regarded as directory only, intended to guide
agency procedures but not to set inflexible requirements. (See, 

Brock

 v. 

Pierce County

, 476 U.S. 253, 259, 106 S. Ct. 1834, 1838, 90 L. Ed. 248, 255 (1986); 

In re Barr Laboratories, Inc.

, 930 F.2d 72, 74 (D.C. Cir. 1991); and, 1A N. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction 25.03 (5th ed. 1991)).

In the case of the State program amendment process, the regulation at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(7), which requires OSM to approve
or disapprove the proposed amendment within 30 days of the close of the comment period, and the regulation at 30 CFR
732.17(h)(13), which establishes the 6-month period for the completion of action on State program amendments, do
not impose any consequence in the event OSM fails to meet the deadlines. Thus, these deadlines are directory, rather
than mandatory.



2. Additional Support for Utah's Proposed Amendment



One commenter, who resides in a rural county in Utah that contains extensive coal reserves, responded with support
of Utah's proposed amendment. The commenter further noted that (1) because of the small population base and large
geographic parameters of the county, which contains mostly Federal lands, it is important to have Utah's proposed
definitions in place in order to develop the local economy and (2) the coal mining industry is a large part of the local
economy providing employment for the citizens of the area. OSM acknowledges these comments.
