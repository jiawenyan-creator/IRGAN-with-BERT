FT  07 MAR 92 / International Company News: Alenia declines sharply despite
sales advance
ALENIA, the Italian state-owned aerospace and electronics group, suffered a
sharp drop in net profits to L56bn (Dollars 44.7m) last year from L97bn in
1990, despite a 15 per cent rise in group sales to more than L4,800bn from
L4,175bn in 1990, writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
At parent company level, the company only broke even last year after setting
aside L138bn in depreciation charges and provisions. As a result, the
dividend, paid by the parent company, is being cut to L60 a share from L90
the previous year - itself reduced from L130 in 1989.
Alenia blamed its earnings fall on the worldwide downturn in defence and
civil aviation orders, as well as adverse exchange rate movements between
the lira and the dollar. Despite the difficulties, the order book edged up
to L11,600bn last year from L10,500bn in 1990.
The group, which was formed from the merger in December 1990 of the Selenia
defence electronics concern and the Aeritalia aerospace business, has been
trying to slim down in response to the tougher business climate.
Staff numbers remained virtually static at around 30,000 last year. However,
last November Alenia reached agreement with the government and unions to cut
the workforce by about 3,000 over the next three years.
