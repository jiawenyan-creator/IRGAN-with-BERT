BODIES OF MARINES KILLED IN CRASH ARRIVE IN U.S. 
The bodies of five Marines killed in a helicopter accident in France arrived 
Friday in the United States. 
A band from the Marine Corps Air Station in Cherry Point, N.C., played "Eternal 
Father" and a solemn version of the Marine Corps Hymn as a Marine honor guard 
carried each flag-draped coffin off the C-5A. 
The bodies were loaded in five hearses and delivered to the base mortuary for 
final preparations, including full military dress, before being returned to 
their hometowns for burial.
