FERRARE TO SKIP 'HOME' 
Cristina Ferrare has decided not to return to ABC's "Home Show" in order to 
spend more time with her newborn daughter, an ABC spokeswoman announced Monday. 
"I love the 'Home Show' and all the people involved, but because I have to be 
up at 4:30 a.m. every day, I couldn't see the new baby until the afternoon," 
Ferrare said through the ABC spokeswoman. "I really want to be with her, as 
well as my 2-year-old daughter." 
Arthur Gregory, Ferrare's manager, said that his client decided very recently 
that the demands of co-hosting the "Home Show," as well as "A.M. Los Angeles," 
were too time consuming. 
He said Ferrare will continue as co-host with Steve Edwards of "A.M. Los 
Angeles," where she returned to work Monday after a five-week maternity leave. 
Ferrare first appeared on the "Home Show" with Robb Weller on Jan. 16 and left 
March 9, the day her daughter, Arianna, was born. 
The ABC spokeswoman said the "Home Show" would continue to have rotating guest 
hosts. DIANNE KLEIN
