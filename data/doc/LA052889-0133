CLU'S BLUHM 8TH IN NAIA 400 FINAL 
Susan Bluhm of Cal Lutheran placed eighth in the 400-meter final at the NAIA 
track championships Saturday at Azusa Pacific. 
Bluhm, a junior, finished in a time of 58.40 seconds, nearly two seconds off 
her school-record time of 56.85, set two weeks ago at the District 3 
championships at Point Loma Nazarene. 
"She had a great season," Cal Lutheran women's track Coach Hector Nieves said. 
"She surpassed all of our expectations all season long. It's nice seeing her 
achieve up to her potential." 
Darren Bernard, who placed fifth in the 400 in the national championships last 
year, failed to advance to the final this weekend. The sophomore placed fifth 
in his semifinal heat Friday in a time of 48.27, but only the top four 
qualified for the final. 
The Cal Lutheran women's team finished in a tie for 53rd place and the men's 
team placed 59th in the team standings.
