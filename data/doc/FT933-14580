FT  14 JUL 93 / Menem election push opposed
THE Catholic Church and the conservative press, two pillars of Argentina's
establishment, yesterday attacked President Carlos Menem's campaign to seek
a second term when his present mandate ends in 1995.
His re-election effort has become the main political issue in Argentina
because it would require a constitutional amendment. A presidential
incumbent may not serve the next term.
Unlike Mr Menem's free market economic reforms, his re-election drive has
aroused strong opposition from business and led to renewed attacks by the
Church.
Yesterday, the influential conservative newspaper La Nacion condemned Mr
Menem's plan for a plebiscite to accelerate the amendment.
Plebiscites are not binding on congress, but the opposition fears the
government would use a likely majority to intimidate congress into backing
an amendment.
The Church's magazine, Criterio, asked in an editorial if Mr Menem's
re-election effort were due 'only to the attraction of power' or to 'the
necessity to perpetuate a group in power so that acts of corruption are not
investigated'.
The Church is divided over Mr Menem's economic strategy, with conservatives
backing his policies and liberals demanding greater social justice. However,
both wings appear to have united in opposition to his re-election.
The attacks on Mr Menem follow the formal proposal last Thursday by Peronist
(government party) senators to amend the constitution. They suggested
broadening civil rights and strengthening the judiciary, as well as lifting
the re-election ban.
