FT  20 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
In trading volumes which displayed end of year thinness, stock index futures
moved ahead briskly, opening up a wide premium to the cash market, writes
Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 March contract was standing at 3,062 at the close of pit
trading, up 20 points for a 69-point advance over the past two trading days.
At the official close the premium to the cash market was 28 points, but at
times, notably during the morning session, this widened to more than 30
points.
As a result a certain amount of arbitrage business went through, although
underlying turnover remained modest. The day saw just 9,216 lots traded.
Turnover stayed weak during late, screen-based trading, but with Wall Street
showing clear signs of weakness the March contract sagged to 3,059, at which
level it was a couple of points above fair value.
The thinness of the market was also reflected in stock option trading, where
lot numbers tailed away to 26,292, from 44,805 on Friday. Calls outstripped
puts by nearly two-to-one. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business accounted for
around 11,500 contracts.
The most actively traded individual stock option was Abbey National, with
2,134 lots dealt. Cable and Wireless, Welcome and British Gas were also well
traded.
