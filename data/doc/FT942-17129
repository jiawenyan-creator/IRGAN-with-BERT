FT  06 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Resurgent bourses defy the
prophets of doom
The mini-crashes in equity markets which were forecast over the Easter
weekend failed to transpire yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
A strategy note from Salomon Brothers had said already that Continental
markets had begun to decouple from those in the US. Yesterday, Goldman Sachs
said that US bond yields should fall, eventually; that European equities are
still undervalued relative to interest rates; and that the earnings growth
'that we expect' should allow equities to outperform bonds.
FRANKFURT's Dax index rose 25.18 to 2,158.29 on the session, and a further
18.80 to 2,177.09 in the post-bourse. This followed a month of
outperformance in German equities, strong on a surge in German exports and
the prospect of accelerated earnings recovery in cyclical stocks.
Turnover rose from DM6.6bn to DM6.7bn. In carmakers, BMW and Volkswagen
continued their battle to lead the share price performance tables, rising
DM11.50 to DM840, and DM8 to DM501.50, with further gains of DM12.50 and DM4
respectively after hours. In chemicals, Bayer climbed DM8.60 to DM381.80 on
the session as traders talked of a big buy order.
Metallgesellschaft, savaged in the first quarter by US oil contract losses,
recovered DM16.80 to DM224.80 on the session, and DM4.70 to DM229.50 in the
post bourse, extending its share price recovery to DM50.50 since the
beginning of last week. Brokers said that a forthcoming rights issue at
DM250 a share was effectively underwritten by the company's creditor banks,
and that this was encouraging speculation in the stock.
PARIS took the initiative from a strong start in the US to break the
downtrend that had gripped equities since two weeks before Easter.
The CAC-40 index moved up 18.31 or 0.8 per cent to 2,100.25, having seen a
low of 2,057 before Wall Street opened.
Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko Europe, writing before yesterday's uptick,
noted that the CAC-40 was 'selling on a little over 20 times 1994 forecast
earnings, if loss making companies are excluded, and is yielding 3.2 per
cent. Following the fall since the start of the year and the break below the
200 day moving average, the market is looking for support at the 2,050
level, but is likely to remain weak on world-wide interest rate fears'.
Eurotunnel, not a CAC-40 constituent, lost FFr1.20 to FFr42.50, on the
announcement that it was planning a rights issue.
MILAN opened sharply lower amid indications of strains within the right wing
alliance, but pared its losses on signs of progress towards a new coalition
government. The Comit index finished 10.58, or 1.4 per cent lower at 724.53,
with much of the day's demand coming from bargain hunting by domestic funds.
Mr David Roche and Mr Richard Davidson at Morgan Stanley who think that
Italian equities could rise by another 15 per cent this year under a
Berlusconi government, raised the Italian weighting in their equity only
European model portfolio from zero to an overweight 6 per cent at the
expense of the UK, France and Switzerland.
Olivetti, L52 lower at L2,652, bucked a mostly firmer trend among blue chip
industrials: Mr Miles Saltiel at Robert Fleming Securities commented that
before the speculative spree which preceded the award of Italy's second
mobile telephone licence, the stock was at 44 per cent of the current price,
which discounts some L1,110, representing Olivetti's share in the Omnitel
franchise. However, Mr Saltiel's analysis suggested that the value of the
franchise for ordinary shareholders was L710, and he has advised investors
to take profits.
AMSTERDAM began the new month with a firm rise, clawing back early losses
when the AEX index fell through the 400 level, seeing a session low of
399.06. The index took its cue from a good opening on Wall Street and
finished the day up 1.55 or 0.4 per cent at 405.40.
KBB, the retail group, went against the trend, losing 70 cents to Fl 113.80
as it announced a rights issue of 1.3m new shares to finance acquisitions.
Aegon, the insurance group, was one of the day's outperformers, finishing up
Fl 2.80 at Fl 97.40, having announced better than expected results before
the Easter break.
ZURICH recouped early losses as Wall Street opened firmer and the SMI index
picked up from a low of 2,769.6 to finish 12.5 higher at 2,807.3.
Chemicals and cyclicals led the market higher: Ciba, the most active stock,
added SFr17 to SFr899.
Comments by Mr Markus Lusser, the Swiss National Bank president, that he
would not be surprised to see inflation below 1 per cent by the summer,
failed to inspire flat to lower financial issues: Zurich Insurance finished
SFr13 down at SFr1,300.
MADRID recovered virtually all of Monday's losses, the general index rising
8.85, or 2.85 per cent to 319.03. US-oriented stocks did well. Telefonica
took back more than it lost, rising Pta110, or 6.8 per cent to Pta1,730 and
Repsol put on Pta180, or 4.5 per cent to Pta4,220.
ISTANBUL surged 7 per cent during an active session in response to the
long-awaited package of austerity measures to cut the budget deficit and
reduce inflation, unveiled by Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister. The
composite index added to Monday's 8.8 per cent advance with a rise of
1,144.97 to 17,500.97.
WARSAW was lower again, the Wig index giving up 749.8, or 5.2 per cent to
13,785.1 in a continuation of the sell-off that has seen the market fall by
a cumulative 33.6 per cent since March 8. Some demand emerged, however, for
selected blue chips at the current prices although brokers doubted that this
indicated the start of a broad recovery.
