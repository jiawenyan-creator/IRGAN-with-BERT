Pacific Fleet since the beginning of the year amounts to around 
70 billion rubles. This was revealed at a meeting between State 
Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, who is leading a parliamentary 
delegation on a tour of Siberia and the Far East, and the 
Command of the Fleet in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy. Apart from 
financial problems, the meeting also focused on the problems of 
manning the armed forces and scrapping stocks of ammunition.
