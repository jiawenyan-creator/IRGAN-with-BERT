to pay their tuition fees. 
  The individual in charge of the Beijing Office of the 
Institutes of Higher Learning said that these 10 institutes are: 
Beijing University, Qinghua University, Chinese People's 
University, Beijing Teachers' University, Beijing Foreign 
Studies University, Beijing College of Architectural 
Engineering, United College of Tourism, Central Institute of 
Fine Arts, Central Conservatory of Music, and Beijing College of
