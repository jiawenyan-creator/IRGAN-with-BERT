Politics: voted Labour last time and will probably vote the same again. She
used to vote Conservative but says 'nobody at my work is happy with the
Tories.'
Sean said: 'I'm not that bothered about the reduction in mortgage interest
relief; it'll cost me pounds 10 a week more. But it's not until 1995. I'm
buying a house on the strength of the profitability of our company. The
increase in petrol costs could affect that quite a lot. On what he's done
there I will still support him.'
