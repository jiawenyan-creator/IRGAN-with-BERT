  [Text] Interfax learned that one more nuclear submarine 
would be withdrawn from the Russian Navy. 
  The submarine is in Vladivostok. Today its crew, headed by 
Second Rank Captain Vladimir Senyiko, came back from the 
Primorye Region to Kamchatka. 
  The submarine has been manned by recruited sailors. Captain 
Senyiko said they would not lose their job but would be 
transferred to another boat.
