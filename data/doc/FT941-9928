FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Marcelin steps down from chair
at SCOA
Mr Jacques Marcelin yesterday resigned as chairman of SCOA, the trading
company controlled by the Paribas banking group, after a disagreement over
strategy.
SCOA, which is in the red with heavy debts, has abandoned a plan devised by
Mr Marcelin to expand its interests in the French supermarket sector in
order to concentrate on reducing its debt and on developing its core trading
activities.
The change in policy was discussed at a board meeting yesterday. Mr Marcelin
objected to the company's new direction and resigned the chairmanship. He
will remain a director of the company and has been replaced on a temporary
basis by Mr Guy de Narbonne, the present chief executive.
SCOA, which is 53 per cent owned by Paribas, has been badly affected by the
French recession and the devaluation of CFA franc, the currency used by
former French colonies in central and western Africa. It made a net interim
loss of FFr598.7m (Dollars 100.2m) in the first half of 1993 and is believed
to have stayed in the red for the full financial year.
Paribas, which is set to raise its stake to 85 per cent after the completion
of a capital increase, said the new strategy would make no difference in the
relationship between the two companies.
