FT  20 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour highlights trade deficit
BRITAIN HAS been running a deficit on its trade in manufactured goods for
more than a decade, Labour claimed yesterday, as it launched a concerted
attack on the government's manufacturing record.
The opposition used trade and industry questions to taunt a succession of
ministers over this deficit.
Labour's attack came within 24 hours of a pledge by Mr John Major, the prime
minister, to direct all of Whitehall's energy towards broadening the
economic recovery and strengthening the country's manufacturing base.
Opening the assault, Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary,
invited ministers to rebuke chancellor Norman Lamont for forecasting in his
March Budget that the manufacturing deficit would double this year.
Britain has had a deficit on its trade in manufactured goods every year
since 1982, Mr Cook said. He inquired how long it would be until the country
got back to the surplus which existed every year before the Conservatives
were elected.
He was supported by Mr Nicholas Winterton, Tory MP for Macclesfield, who
asked when Britain would start to reduce the deficit.
Challenged over last year's Pounds 2bn balance of payments deficit on cars,
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, said the country could look forward to
'a steady increase in the number of cars sold in Britain that are produced
in Britain.'
He said it was important for Britain to avoid 'saddling' manufacturers with
the effects of the Maastricht treaty's social chapter.
Mr John Butcher, a former Conservative industry minister, urged the
government to abolish capital taxation 'within the lifetime of this
parliament.' Manufacturing was more capital-intensive than the service
sector, he said.
