FT  12 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Fund managers eye pensions business
European and US fund managers are mounting a campaign to win access to
Japan's tightly guarded pension fund management business as bilateral trade
talks between the US and Japan resume in Tokyo this week.
Frustrated foreign money managers, who have had little success in breaking
into Japan's corporate pension fund management business opened in 1990, are
demanding to be allowed to manage public pension funds, currently restricted
to trust banks and life assurers.
Although US pressure forced the partial liberalisation of fund management
and corporate pension and mutual aid associations, foreign money managers
have failed to gain access to such funds because of the tight relationships
between Japanese corporations and fund managers. For some foreign fund
managers, winning public fund management contracts is the only way they can
justify maintaining operations in Japan.
Meanwhile, the issue is not only a concern for the trade negotiators and
investment managers. Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare, which holds
jurisdiction over the state pension system, is also unhappy about the
Finance Ministry's tight grip on how the Y100,000bn (Pounds 600bn) in
reserves can be invested.
