FT  18 OCT 93 / International Company News: Havas suffers downturn
HAVAS, the leading French leisure group, saw net profits fall by 3.4 per
cent to FFr423m (Dollars 74m) in the first half of this year from the same
period of 1992 and warned of lower net profits for the full year.
The group, which has extensive media and travel interests in France, said it
had been affected by 'sluggish trends' in its advertising businesses,
billboard interests and travel activities.
Havas pushed up revenues by 4.1 per cent to FFr14.8bn in the first six
months of 1993. The proportion of its revenue made outside France rose to
37.9 per cent from 33.8 per cent.
