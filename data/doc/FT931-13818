FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: SE Banken plans sweeping
shake-up
SKANDANAVISKA Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading commercial bank, is planning
a sweeping reorganisation to help restore profitability.
An announcement is expected within the next month, and could come after
today's group board meeting.
The restructuring could include severe job cuts, branch closures, management
changes and the sale of non-core businesses. The bank said yesterday that a
reorganisation was under way but would not comment on reports that it was to
be split into three parts, covering traditional business, corporate lending
and bad debts.
News of the planned overhaul comes just over a month after the bank
contacted the government about possible state support.
SE Banken has suffered large credit losses, along with other Swedish banks,
and recorded a SKr2.61bn (Dollars 361.5m) operating loss for the first eight
months of last year. Credit losses for the whole of 1992 are expected to
reach SKr10bn. Capital adequacy has also been impaired by the falling value
of the floating Swedish krona.
