FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Vinten in the black at Pounds 9.06m
Vinten, the international manufacturer and supplier of photographic,
broadcast and surveillance products, yesterday reported interim pre-tax
profits of Pounds 9.06m, compared with a losses of Pounds 1.71m after taking
account of a Pounds 7.27m exceptional charge.
Acquisitions made in 1993, favourable trading conditions and the elimination
of loss-making activities, including the electro-optics operations, helped
lift trading profits by 59 per cent to Pounds 9.52m (Pounds 6m) on turnover
which advanced by 7 per cent to Pounds 46.7m (Pounds 43.7m).
Earnings per share of 18.4p compare with losses of 7.2p and the interim
dividend rises to 2.4p (2.1p).
Mr Malcolm Baggott, group chief executive, said the results, which were
ahead of market expectations, represented 'an outstanding performance.' The
shares closed 19p higher at 502p.
The profit advance was led by the photographic business, which increased its
profit contribution by 48 per cent to Pounds 5.24m (Pounds 3.54m) in
turnover up 30 per cent to Pounds 21m (Pounds 16.1m). The latest period
included a full contribution from Bogen Photo which was acquired in April
last year and a particularly strong performance by Gruppo Manfrotto.
The broadcast business, which comprises Vinten Broadcast and Bexel which
reported substantially improved results, more than doubled its profits to
Pounds 2.89m (Pounds 1.24m) on turnover which grew by 7 per cent to Pounds
16.3m (Pounds 15.3m). Trading profits were boosted by cost reductions and by
the acquisition of Total Spectrum Manufacturing in June last year.
Surveillance, the old core Vinten business, managed to increase turnover by
a more modest 2 per cent to Pounds 9.35m (Pounds 9.17m) although profits at
Pounds 1.4m were slightly down on the unusually high Pounds 1.69m in 1993.
Vinten's cash flow was again very strong and net debt fell by Pounds 10.7m
to Pounds 700,000 resulting in negligible gearing at the end of June.
COMMENT
Vinten's transformation from a small domestic defence orientated business
into an international company with three main business activities is
complete and the group is now beginning to reap the rewards. Bolstered by
shrewd acquisitions and timely disposals the trading margin in the latest
period was a very comfortable 20.4 per cent. Perhaps the biggest question
facing the management is what to do for an encore. With Pounds 29m of cash
in the balance sheet at the half year and virtually no gearing the
management has plenty of flexibility. Building a fourth leg to the business
looks like a reasonable option. In the meantime analysts were upgrading
their full year pre-tax profit forecasts yesterday to around Pounds 18m
producing earnings of about 36.8p. Despite yesterday's rise the shares are
trading on a prospective p/e of 13.6 and still look good value.
