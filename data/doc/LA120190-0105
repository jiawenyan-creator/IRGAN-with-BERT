2-A PLAYOFFS; 
KEARNY'S SCOTT RUNS PAST RAMONA, 35-22 
Ramona High Coach Mel Galli saids his team would not have a chance of beating 
Kearny if Friday's game turned into a track meet. 
Galli couldn't have been more prophetic if he had been Carl Sagan. The track 
meet began slowly with a couple of 20-yard sprints by Kearny's Darnay Scott. 
And just as Ramona grew close at 14-7 in the second quarter, Scott lengthened 
his stride and said goodbye to the Ramona secondary and hello to the 2-A San 
Diego Section finals. 
Kearny won 35-22 Friday before 300 fans at Mira Mesa High, but it really wasn't 
that close. Kearny (11-1-1), which lost to Lincoln and Marcus Allen 34-6 in its 
last appearance in the section finals 13 years ago, will play either El Camino 
or La Jolla next Saturday (8 p.m. at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium). 
Ramona's huge offensive line actually held up its end of the bargain, allowing 
halfback Sarn Salmon to rush for 143 yards. But the Bulldogs' defensive 
secondary was no match for Scott and his buddies. 
Kearny quarterback Sam Page riddled the Ramona secondary for 280 yards on nine 
completions in 13 attempts. 
With San Diego State Coach Al Luginbill watching on the sidelines, Scott caught 
four Page passes for 144 yards. But his biggest catch came one play after he 
stopped a second-quarter Ramona drive with his 10th interception of the season. 
With Scott split wide right, Page lofted the ball his way. Although he had to 
come back for the ball and two Ramona defenders at the Kearny 40, Scott was 
fast enough to outrun everyone for the end zone. 
"We saw it was open," Scott said. "I just had to split their two backs. Once I 
caught it, I knew I could get by them becasue I run kind of fast." 
Galli said Scott's 85-yard touchdown was the clincher. 
"Darnay made the big play," Galli said. "That was the ball game. 
"Once we started letting them throw the bombs, it was over. We just got 
out-talented in the secondary."
