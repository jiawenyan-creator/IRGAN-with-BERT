FT  14 OCT 92 / Observer: Fat stress
In the UK anyone admitting to 'going to work on an egg' is subject to
instant derision, comparable to admitting to being a smoker. But in the US
the Centers for Disease Control have discovered that cholesterol-awareness
levels vary widely across the country. In the maple-syrup stronghold of
Vermont, for instance, an average 31 per cent of people know their
cholesterol level. Hard on its heels are Maine, Massachusetts, North Dakota
and Wisconsin, each with an average 30 per cent.
Bottom of the league table, with just 15 per cent awareness, comes
Washington DC. But given the amount of stress generated in that fraught
city, perhaps people have more pressing things to worry about.
