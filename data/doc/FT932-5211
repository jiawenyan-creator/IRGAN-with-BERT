FT  04 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Do It All doubts
Hints from Boots that it might be losing patience with its loss-making Do It
All home improvement chain were reported by analysts after attending the
company's post-results meeting yesterday. Do It All, owned as a joint
venture with WH Smith, has been badly buffeted by the recession and has
suffered from stiff competition from leading rivals, Texas and B&amp;Q.
In January, Smith's share of losses from Do It All were Pounds 8.4m, leading
some stores specialists to question the strategy of both groups making any
further investment in the venture. Yesterday, Boots said its Do It All
losses were Pounds 14.4m. One analyst commented: 'We believe that if
business does not improve within six months, Boots will decide to either
sell or pull out.' Otherwise, Boots results were largely in line with
expectations and the shares slipped 3 to 444p.
