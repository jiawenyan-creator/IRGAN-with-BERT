  [Text] Brussels December 3 TASS -- The North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council succeeded to do what the CSCE session of 
foreign ministers failed to accept in Rome - to urge Ukraine to 
ratify the START-1 treaty without any reservations, according to 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
  "As far as the problem of non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons is concerned, in Brussels (we) succeeded to do what was 
not done in Rome. The final communique urges the ratification 
of the START-1 treaty and the joining of the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty by all countries," he told reporters on 
Friday. 
  "In other words, there is no doubts that the decision of the 
Ukrainian Supreme Soviet is not viewed as the ratification of 
the START-1 treaty and the task of eliminating the nuclear 
weapons still faces out southern neighbour", Kozyrev said. 
  The North Altlantic Cooperation Council is working in a 
"more 
realistic manner" than the recent CSCE meeting in Rome, he added. 
  He also welcomed the fact that the issue of an urgent 
admission of East European nations to NATO was postponed. "There 
is no talk about it now, the issue has been omitted from the 
agenda", the minister said and added that the council is now 
discussing the Russian initiative to develop partnership between 
East European states, Russia and NATO members in such concrete 
spheres as conversion and peace-keeping efforts. 
  The intiative is viewed by Moscow as an alternative plan to 
NATO expansion.
