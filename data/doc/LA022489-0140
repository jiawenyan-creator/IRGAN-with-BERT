BIG SODA POP SPILL CAUSES FREEWAY DELAY 
Soda spilling from a Pepsi truck caused a mess and a big delay around a major 
Orange County freeway intersection Thursday, the California Highway Patrol 
said. 
Spokesman Mike Lundquist said a ramp between the northbound Orange Freeway and 
the eastbound Riverside Freeway was closed for about 2 hours after the 
semi-truck spilled about half its load. Leaking cola spilled over all lanes of 
the ramp and onto the eastbound lanes of the Riverside Freeway. The ramp was 
closed between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. while Caltrans cleaned up the soda 
using a water truck, a sweeper and a scraper.
