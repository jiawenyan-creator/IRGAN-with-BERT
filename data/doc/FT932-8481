FT  19 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Companies cleared of bribing Marcos
A FEDERAL jury in Newark, New Jersey, yesterday cleared Westinghouse
Electric and a New Jersey engineering company of charges that the two had
bribed former Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos to win a 1976 contract
to build a nuclear power plant, Our New York Staff reports.
The Philippine government accused Westinghouse and Burns &amp; Roe of funnelling
nearly Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.9m) in bribes to Mr Marcos through an
associate. The Philippines sought Dollars 26.6m in compensatory damages.
Most of the counts in the suit had been dismissed by the judge, who ordered
them to be sent to outside arbitration.
The trial had gone ahead on three remaining counts.
General Raul Goco, Philippines solicitor general, said: 'This does not end
the process. . . but we are very disappointed.' He said his country was
engaged in arbitration with the two companies before an international
tribunal in Geneva over allegations of breach of contract, negligence, civil
conspiracy and anti-trust violations.
Mr Louis Briskman, Westinghouse senior vice-president and general counsel,
said at the end of the two-month trial: 'We are pleased an impartial jury
has reaffirmed Westinghouse's innocence and the integrity of our business
practices. . . This issue is almost 20 years old and it has been reviewed
over and over again since the mid-1970s. Once again we have been
exonerated.'
