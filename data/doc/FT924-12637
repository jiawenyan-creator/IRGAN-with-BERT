FT  20 OCT 92 / Women trail men on pay in banking
BRITISH women working in banking and finance earn 53 per cent of men's
earnings in the same sector in an average month, according to figures from
the Equal Opportunities Commission. It says that is a lower percentage than
women receive in eight other European Community countries, Catherine Milton
writes.
The figures also put Britain second from bottom in a league of 11 countries
for average female manual industrial earnings as a proportion of men's
earnings per hour. Only Luxembourg is lower.
The figure for industry is the more accurate because a comparison of average
monthly earnings tends to widen the difference between men's and women's
earnings because women work shorter hours.
Earnings' comparisons are hampered by the lack of data for certain
countries.
