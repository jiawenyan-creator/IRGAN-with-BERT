METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN INJURED BY LEFTOVER FIRECRACKER 
A North Hollywood woman was seriously injured Wednesday when she lit a large 
firecracker she recovered from a trash bin, believing it was a candle, fire 
department officials said. 
Estella Rica, 54, suffered burns to her right hand and left foot, Los Angeles 
City Fire Department officials said. Rica told paramedics she had recovered the 
two-inch firecracker from a plastic bag in a dumpster behind her Victory 
Boulevard apartment. 
Rica told paramedics that she was in the kitchen of her apartment when she lit 
the firecracker. 
As the fuse began to hiss, she dropped the firecracker to the floor and it 
exploded. 
Rica was taken to St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank, where spokeswoman 
Alexis Parkes said a plastic surgeon was attempting to reconstruct Rica's badly 
damaged right hand. 
The blast did not damage Rica's apartment, a Fire Department spokesman said.
