FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Pilot to raise Pounds 15m via placing
PILOT Investment Trust, specialist investor in smaller companies, yesterday
reported a 25 per cent increase in net asset value per ordinary share in the
period from its launch date on March 5 to September 30 and announced plans
to raise Pounds 15m net via a placing of C shares at 100p each.
The net asset value increased from 96.8p to 121.1p and at October 29 had
risen further to 125.5p. Profit before tax to September 30 was Pounds
388,000 and earnings per share 1.2p. The directors declared an interim
dividend of 0.5p. This is considered a base level from which it hopes to pay
a progressively rising dividend.
The company proposes to raise the Pounds 15m by way of a conditional placing
of 12.3m C shares and an offer of up to 3.07m C shares.
Sir Peter Michael, chairman, said yesterday that the company was interested
in the smaller companies in the UK index which had been 'unloved for some
years'. He said Pilot targeted companies with young dynamic management teams
which had trimmed the companies down and were ready to grow.
The directors believe that there are many attractive investment
opportunities in Pilot's target sector of quoted companies with a market
value of up to Pounds 30m. There are about 1,000 of them with a combined
value of Pounds 10bn.
Manager of the portfolio, Rutherford Asset Management, has undertaken a
rearrangement of the initial stocks accepted at the launch. The Pounds 25m
raised at the launch has been fully invested for some time and the company
now has borrowings of about Pounds 1m. Of the net cash available after the
launch costs more than 50 per cent was invested in capital raising
situations.
