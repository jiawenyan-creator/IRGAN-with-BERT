COMMENDING THOMPSON FOR TAKING A WALK 
Regarding the Murray article of Jan. 26: Murray was not at his best in his 
tirade against Georgetown's John Thompson, a coach who has been relentless in 
maintaining discipline and insisting that his kids apply themselves to their 
studies on or off the road. But before that he had to be confident that his 
recruits were endowed with the gray matter and determination to meet the high 
moral and academic standards of Georgetown. Perhaps Murray can get Jimmy the 
Greek and that Dodger VIP (whose name I have already forgotten) to help him 
extricate his foot from his mouth. Then I suggest that he ask his BUSHel of 
supporters in Washington to get the Pentagon to build him a bullet proof shoe 
(for 20 grand or so) to protect him in case he keeps trying to shoot himself in 
the foot.
