  [Text] Tehran, March 28, IRNA -- Oil Minister Gholam Reza 
Aqazadeh said here Monday that Saudi Arabia's decision to oppose 
any decrease in the OPEC's production ceiling has only served to 
keep down the price of oil. 
  Speaking at a press conference upon his return from an OPEC 
ministerial meeting in Geneva, Aqazadeh regretted that political 
issues always affected the decisions of the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). 
  He did not rule out the possibility that Saudi Arabia's 
decision might be linked with Iran's position on the number of 
Iranian pilgrims for this year's Hajj pilgrimage. 
  Saudi Arabia has decided to cut the number of Iranian 
pilgrims from 115,000 to 60,000. 
  On the sideline of the OPEC meeting, he said, some Saudi 
Arabian delegates raised the issue concerning the quota of 
Iranian pilgrims and criticized the Iranian press for their 
stance on the matter. 
  According to Aqazadeh if the OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers 
had agreed to cut their output ceiling, it would have pushed up 
the price of oil up to three to four dollars per barrel.
