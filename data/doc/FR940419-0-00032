Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this regulation are Lieutenant W. Petig, Project Manager for the Coast
Guard Captain of the Port, Providence, Lieutenant Commander J. Stieb, Project Counsel for the First Coast Guard District
Legal Office, and Lieutenant M. Swegles, Project Coordinator for the First Coast Guard District Aids to Navigation
and Waterways Management Office.



Regulatory History



On February 17, 1993, the Captain of the Port, Providence, signed an emergency Safety Zone Regulation for the Providence
River Channel. This regulation was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14151). The Captain of the Port, Providence requested comments concerning the safety zone
regulation and received none. This emergency Safety Zone Regulation imposed restrictions on vessel traffic pertaining
to maximum allowable drafts, one way traffic, and communications.

The Coast Guard published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposing the establishment of a Regulated Navigation
Area in the Providence River in the 

Federal Register

 on December 16, 1993 (58 FR 65684). That NPRM differed from the emergency safety zone regulations by enlarging the
area which is regulated, adding a restriction concerning operations in reduced visibility, and reducing the number
of SECURITE call locations for outbound vessels. No letters or comments on the proposed rule were received. Therefore,
the Coast Guard is publishing the final regulation as proposed. Public hearings were not requested and none were held.



Background and Purpose



In February of 1993, the Captain of the Port, Providence, received the results of a hydrographic survey of the Providence
River Federal navigation channel. This survey conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers showed that serious shoaling
was taking place in the northern section of the channel. To provide for the safety of the port, the Captain of the Port,
Providence, published an emergency Safety Zone regulation in the 

Federal Register

 on March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14151). Comments were solicited and none were received. A task force to study the need for dredging
in the affected areas was organized by the state. However, due to the contamination of the dredge spoils and local environmental
concerns, a decision is not expected in the near future. The finalizing of this RNA will allow the Coast Guard to regulate
vessel traffic over an extended period of time. It is designed to protect the Port of Providence from any deep draft
vessel casualty due to shoaling that may result in a grounding or associated casualty leading to loss of life, injury,
property loss, oil or hazardous material discharge, or blockage of the channel.

The existing safety zone regulating vessel traffic in the effected area will expire on May 1, 1994. In the interest
of safety and the public's interest in maintaining continuity in the regulations governing vessel traffic in this
area, good cause exists for having this rule, which is nearly identical to the regulations that have been in effect
since February 17, 1993, take effect on May 1, 1994.
