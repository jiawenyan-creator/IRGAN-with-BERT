<F P=106> [Interview with President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide by </F>
O GLOBO Correspondent Deborah Berlinck in Geneva; date not given] 
  [Text] [Berlinck] Since you were exiled from Haiti in 1991, 
Mr. President, every diplomatic way to reinstate you in office 
was attempted -- a countless number of negotiations, embargoes 
on trade with Haiti. Do you think that foreign military 
intervention will be necessary? 
  [Aristide] If 67 percent of the Haitian people voted for me 
three years ago, more than 90 percent of Haitians are at present 
requesting my reinstatement as president. Despite the more than 
100,000 murders perpetrated by the military, the Haitian people 
are determined to continue struggling for their dignity and the 
defense of their rights. The international community ought to 
express more clearly its political will to support us. The 
trade embargo is not enough to oblige military putschists to 
hand over power. 
  [Berlinck] What do you expect, Mr. President? An American 
military intervention? 
  [Aristide] We do not need a military intervention but rather 
a show of political will by those who claim to be our friends. 
Democracy in Haiti will not just rain down from heaven, you know. 
  [Berlinck] The United States has crossed Haiti off its list 
of foreign policy priorities. Why has the United States 
abandoned you? 
  [Aristide] Haiti's fate will be defined by the Haitian 
people, and not by others. Haiti is a country that presently 
has an 80-percent illiteracy rate. But fortunately, illiterate 
people are not morons -- they manifest their intelligence with 
courage. We are struggling to impose the rule of law in our 
country without expecting a solution from others. The solution 
will have to stem from our struggle. 
  [Berlinck] To what extent are you willing to negotiate with 
the military about your reinstatement as Haitian president? 
  [Aristide] We are Haiti. And when I say us, I do not refer 
only to myself. We are not fighting for power only; we are 
fighting to establish democracy in our country. If the 
international community respects its commitment to the agreement 
(which provided for his reinstatement in office last December, 
but which was not honored by the military), the people will 
become involved. 
  [Berlinck] And if the military were to impose as a condition 
holding new elections? 
  [Aristide] No, the people have already decided and their 
will 
must be respected. We will be flexible in our answer, and we 
will respond with dignity in the face of complicity. Last 
January, four countries that claim to be our friends issued an 
ultimatum to the military to step down from power lest they 
should impose more sanctions against Haiti. And what has come 
of it? Or is there complicity in this affair? 
  [Berlinck] The military insist that an amnesty be declared 
for them. 
  [Aristide] The agreement signed last year includes a 
political amnesty for the military. That provision was honored. 
We have done everything possible for the agreement and the 
military will have to step down. I spent hours thinking about 
the agreement last July before signing it because I was 
convinced that this strategy of co-existence with the military 
would lead us to annihilation. They assassinated our justice 
minister. How many more ministers do we have to lose? If there 
is international complicity, the military will demand other 
concessions. 
  [Berlinck] Are you then ready to wait in exile as long as 
necessary until you can be reinstated as president under your 
own conditions, Mr. President? 
  [Aristide] I am ready to continue fighting with my people. 
Power for power's sake can only lead to corruption and Leonardo 
Boff [a lifelong advocate of the Theology of Liberation] has 
already warned about this. We want to institute the rule of law 
and our time in exile ought to contribute to making our 
historical progress toward that objective fruitful. 
  [Berlinck] What would you do, Mr. President, to reestablish 
order in your country if you were reinstated as president now? 
  [Aristide] While not encouraging revenge, I would try to put 
an end to impunity. I am in favor of a reconciliation process 
based on justice. Our country is at present like a broken vase 
-- we must pick up the fragments and piece them together once 
again. 
  [Berlinck] What do you expect of the United Nations Mr. 
President? 
  [Aristide] I expect that the United Nations may save face 
because a failure of its endeavors in Haiti will spell the end 
of its credibility. 
  [Berlinck] Do you feel that Latin American governments 
support you, Mr. President? 
  [Aristide] Yes, I do. When I was in Brazil, I felt that 
Brazilians showed solidarity with Haitian people because deep 
down we have similar problems. I found friends like Leonardo 
Boff, who wrote the foreword for my latest book. I look to the 
future with optimism when I see the dynamic force of Third World 
countries, of Brazil, of Haiti.
