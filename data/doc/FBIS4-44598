Experiments"; manuscript received 20 August 1993, revised

  [Text] The dissolution behavior of unirradiated 
UO[.sub]2[/] and (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] fuel in nitric acid is 
studied. Detailed descriptions of the effects of nitric acid 
concentration, temperature, pellet processing methods, 
PuO[.sub]2[/] content, and other factors on dissolution rates 
are provided and plutonium valence state changes and undissolved 
residue contents during the dissolution process are 
measured. 
  It is common knowledge that complete dissolution of 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] is required to ensure recovery of the 
plutonium in the fuel reprocessing process and prevent 
criticality accidents. Thus, fast reactor fuel dissolution 
experiments are very important for improving and evaluating fuel 
pellet fabrication techniques and designing fuel reprocessing 
flow processes. 
  Much research has been done in foreign countries on 
dissolution of fast reactor mixed oxide fuel elements in nitric 
acid[.sup][1-5][/]. The results show that the dissolution 
rate of fuel pellets is related to many factors. China's fast 
reactor research work is just beginning and the first batch of 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] fuel pellets that we developed are limited 
in number and have not been placed in the reactor and 
irradiated. Thus, to obtain data on Chinese-made fast reactor 
mixed oxide fuel dissolution as quickly as possible, we only 
studied the more important variables such as nitric acid 
concentration, temperature, pellet processing methods, 
PuO[.sub]2[/] content, and so on. 
  The research work was divided into two stages. First, we 
used 
UO[.sub]2[/] to conduct simulated fast reactor fuel 
dissolution experiments in the China Atomic Energy Scientific 
Research Academy and, after gaining some experience, we carried 
out dissolution of unirradiated (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets at 
the Lanzhou Nuclear Fuel Plant. The results of the experiments 
show that the first batch of (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] fuel pellets 
developed in China had excellent dissolution properties and that 
their dissolution rate and undissolved residues could satisfy 
reprocessing requirements.

<H5>  B. Dissolution equipment </H5>
  The dissolver is a three-necked flask fitted with a 
condensing tube and thermometer that uses a 
temperature-regulated kettle-type electric furnace to control 
the dissolution temperature. 
<H5>  C. Experimental Method </H5>
  Into the dissolver we added 50 ml (360 ml was added for the 
UO[.sub]2[/] pellets) of HNO[.sub]3[/] or 
HNO[.sub]3[/]-HF solution at a specific concentration. After 
preheating to the experimental temperature, we placed one 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellet into the loading port and dissolved 
it. At different times, we removed 0.1 ml of the dissolved 
liquid (1 ml was removed for the UO[.sub]2[/] pellets) and 
measured the uranium and plutonium concentrations and plutonium 
valence states. Usually, the pellets were dissolved for 5 hours 
and then filtered out of the dissolved liquid. After using 
dilute acid to wash the undissolved residues and filter paper, 
we placed them in a magnetic crucible and incinerated them for 1 
hour in a muffle furnace (600C), after which we weighed the 
undissolved residues in a 1:10,000 balance. We boiled and 
dissolved the residues in 50 ml of 12 mol/l 
HNO[.sub]3[/]-0.05 mol/l HF for 1 hour, anaylzed the uranium 
and plutonium in the residue solution, calculated the 
uranium/plutonium ratio, and measured the amount of the residues 
using the symmetrical weight method. 
  The dissolution experiments on the UO[.sub]2[/] and 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets were carried out, respectively, in 
a common radiation chemistry laboratory and a special glove box 
in the reprocessing plant, and all analysis of the 
plutonium-bearing samples was conducted in the glove box. 
  Unless otherwise indicated, in the coprecipitated pellets 
used in the experiments, the pellets had a PuO[.sub]2[/] 
content of 27 percent, the dissolution acidity was 12 mol/l 
HNO[.sub]3[/], and the temperature was the boiling point (BP). 
<H5>  D. Analytical methods </H5>
  1. Uranium: measured directly using spectrophotometry (415 
nm). When the uranium contained plutonium, it was measured using 
Br-PADAP spectrophotometry[.sup][6][/]. 
  2. Plutonium: measured using the 17 keV X-ray measurement 
method[.sup][7][/]. 
  3. Pu(IV) and Pu(VI): measured using the TTA or PMBP 
extraction method[.sup][8][/]. 
<H5>  II. Results and Discussion </H5>
<H5>  A. UO </H5>[.sub]2[/] Fuel Pellet Dissolution 
  1. Dissolution curve. Figure 1 shows the dissolution curve 
of 
the UO[.sub]2[/] pellets. The curve starts out relatively 
flat and then rises quickly, after which it again flattens and 
gradually reaches the end point of dissolution. A dissolution 
curve with this shape can be interpreted using changes in the 
effective surface area during the dissolution process. There was 
a large amount of excess nitric acid in the experiments and the 
acidity and other conditions basically did not change during the 
experiments, so the dissolution rate (mg/cm[.sup]2[/]) can be 
considered constant. Because there is a positive ratio between 
the amount of pellet dissolution per unit of time and the 
effective dissolution surface area and because the initial 
surface (processed surface) of the pellet at the start of 
dissolution is relatively smooth and the effective surface area 
is smaller, the amount of dissolution is also smaller. As 
dissolution continued, the surface of the pellet became 
increasingly rougher and the effective surface area also 
continued to increase. According to estimates by 
Uriarte[.sup][2][/], the surface roughness at 50 percent 
dissolution of the uranium pellet is increased three- to 
five-fold, and as a result there is a sharp increase in the 
amount of dissolution. As the remaining pellet becomes 
increasingly smaller, its surface area is also gradually reduced 
so that the amount of dissolution becomes smaller as a result 
until the end point of dissolution. Actually, measurement of the 
effective surface area during the dissolution process is very 
difficult, so Uriarte used the concept of a Roughness Constant 
(RC) to do a quantitative description of changes in the surface 
of the pellets during the dissolution process that is computed 
using the formula below: 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 


  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  R[.sub]0[/], R[.sub]k[/], and R[.sub]n[/] are, 
respectively, the radius of the pellet at the instant when 
dissolution begins, in the middle, and at the final instant, and 
RF is the roughness factor. It can be derived by dividing the 
amount of pellet that is dissolved per unit of time by the 
amount that should be dissolved to maintain the surface 
smoothness and the constant dissolution rate. 
  2. Effects of nitric acid concentration. The UO[.sub]2[/] 
can undergo the following types of reactions when being 
dissolved in nitric acid[.sup][4][/]: 
  UO[.sub]2[/] + 4HNO[.sub]3[/] 
UO[.sub]2[/](NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]2[/] + 2NO[.sub]2[/] 
+ 2H[.sub]2[/]O 
  UO[.sub]2[/] + 8/3HNO[.sub]3[/] 
UO[.sub]2[/](NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]2[/] + 
2/3NO[.sub]2[/] + 4/3H[.sub]2[/]O 
  UO[.sub]2[/] + 3HNO[.sub]3[/] 
UO[.sub]2[/](NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]2[/] + 1/2NO + 
1/2NO[.sub]2[/] + 3/2H[.sub]2[/]O 
  Like the dissolution of metallic uranium, there is no common 
chemical reaction that can completely represent the actual 
dissolution process. In the experiments we compared the 
dissolution of the UO[.sub]2[/] pellets in 12 mol/l, 8 mol/l, 
and 4 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/]. The results indicate that as the 
acidity is reduced the dissolution rate drops quickly (Figure 
1). In dissolution for three hours at 4 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/], 
the amount of dissolution was only about 15 percent. 
  3. Effects of temperature. Dissolution experiments were 
conducted at different temperatures. The results show that the 
dissolution rate at 100C is slightly lower than the 
dissolution rate below the boiling point (Figure 2). 
Nevertheless, because the dissolution was steady at 100C, 
it still has substantial attractiveness for use in industrial 
production. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

<H5>  B. (U,Pu)O </H5>[.sub]2[/] fuel pellet dissolution 
  1. Dissolution curve. Figure 3 shows a typical 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellet dissolution curve. Like the 
UO[.sub]2[/] pellets, the curve is flat for a period of time 
as dissolution starts and then becomes significantly steeper 
until it eventually re-flattens and reaches the dissolution end 
point. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  2. Effects of nitric acid concentration. The dissolution 
rate 
of the (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets depends significantly on the 
dissolution acidity (Figure 3). For example, in dissolution for 
three hours in 12 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/], the amount of pellet 
dissolution is greater than 95 percent, but is just 30 percent 
in 4 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/]. 
  3. Effects of temperature. In a dissolution situation 
similar 
to that of the UO[.sub]2[/] pellets, there is also a 
corresponding reduction in the dissolution rate of the 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets as the dissolution temperature is 
reduced from the boiling point to 100C (Figure 4). This 
result is consistent with the result in article [4]. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  4. Effects of hydrofluoric acid. Just as was pointed out in 
many articles, adding 0.05 mol/l of HF to the nitric acid can 
significantly increase the dissolution rate of the 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets. The results of our experiments 
(Figure 5) show that in the initial stage of dissolution, the 
addition of HF significantly accelerates pellet dissolution. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  5. Effects of pellet processing methods. The effects of 
pellet processing methods on the dissolution rate of the 
(U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets are shown in Figure 6. One can see 
in Figure 6 that the mechanically blended pellets have a faster 
dissolution rate than the coprecipitated pellets. This 
experimental result is consistent with article [2], but 
contradicts the data in article [1]. The cause of this situation 
could be related to different pellet sources and processing 
parameters. In our experiments, we discovered that the sintered 
density of the mechanically blended pellets was relatively low 
and that they had a loose structure, so that when being boiled 
in 12 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/] they fractured very quickly into a 
heap of powder, which obviously would help accelerate 
dissolution. However, this situation occurred in the 
coprecipitated pellets only after most of the pellets had been 
dissolved. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  6. Effects of PuO[.sub]2[/] content. The effect of the 
PuO[.sub]2[/] content in the (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets on 
the dissolution rate is shown in Figure 7. One can see in Figure 
7 that the higher the PuO[.sub]2[/] content, the slower the 
rate of dissolution. Koch[.sup][9][/] feels that in actual 
use, to maintain a reasonable dissolution rate, the 
PuO[.sub]2[/] content should be less than 40 percent. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  7. Undissolved residues. After the pellets had been 
dissolved 
for five hours, the solution still contained a small amount of 
undissolved residues. Their content varied according to pellet 
processing method, batch number, and dissolution conditions. It 
was 0.03 to 0.5 percent for the coprecipitated pellets and 0.3 
to 1.6 percent for the mechanically blended pellets (Table 2). 
This data is basically identical to that reported in article [1].

  Observed under the microscope, the particles of the 
undissolved residues are very small, usually smaller than 1 
m 
to 10 m. Figure 8 is a photograph of the particles of the 
undissolved residues. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Chemical analysis shows that the plutonium content of the 
undissolved residues significantly exceeds the initial plutonium 
content of the pellets. For example, the initial 
m[.sub]U[/]/m[.sub]Pu[/] was 2.7 in the 27 percent 
PuO[.sub]2[/]-UO[.sub]2[/] pellets, but after dissolution 
for five hours in boiling 12 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/] the 
m[.sub]U[/]/m[.sub]Pu[/] in the residue dropped to about 
0.5. The undissolved residues were very easily dissolved in 12 
mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/]-0.05 mol/l HF. 
  8. Uranium optimum solution phenomenon. When 
Lerch[.sup][1][/] used boiling 12 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/] to 
dissolve mechanically blended (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets, he 
discovered that the dissolution rate of UO[.sub]2[/] was 
significantly faster than the dissolution rate of 
PuO[.sub]2[/]. We also discovered this type of "uranium 
optimum solution" phenomenon in our experiments on dissolution 
of mechanically blended pellets, but this type of phenomenon did 
not appear in the coprecipitated pellets (Figure 9). A possible 
interpretation is that the mechanically blended pellets have a 
loose texture and break down in the initial period of 
dissolution into a powdered form. Everyone knows that the 
dissolution rate of UO[.sub]2[/] in concentrated nitric acid 
is faster than that of PuO[.sub]2[/], so the dissolution 
curve of UO[.sub]2[/] appears above that of PuO[.sub]2[/]. 
For the coprecipitated pellets, dissolution basically occurs on 
the surface of the pellets while the pellet surface causes 
uranium optimum solution to occur, which does not have too great 
of an effect on the UO[.sub]2[/] dissolution curve and does 
not lead to the occurrence of "separation" phenomena in the 
UO[.sub]2[/] and PuO[.sub]2[/] dissolution curves. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  9. Acid consumption. The experiments were conducted in 
conditions of a large excess of nitric acid. Analysis of the 
acidity at the end point of dissolution shows that in the 12 
mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/] boiling dissolution coprecipitated pellet 
experiments, 1 mol of (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] consumed 6 mol of 
nitric acid. Because of condensation efficiency differences in 
the condensing tubes and the escape of part of the nitric acid 
vapor from the sampling port due to frequent sampling, the 
actual acid consumption used for dissolution of the pellets 
would be lower than this value. 
  10. Plutonium valence states. The valence states of the 
plutonium in the fuel pellet solution constitute an important 
reference value for subsequent value readjustment steps. In a 
situation of concentrated nitric acid boiling dissolution, 
Pu(III) cannot exist, so we only tracked and analyzed Pu(IV) and 
Pu(VI). The results show that the plutonium in the solution 
exists primarily as Pu(IV) while the Pu(VI) content varies 
depending on the pellet processing methods and dissolution 
conditions (Table 3). Overall, there are these regularities: 1) 
As the dissolution time increases, there is a tendency for the 
Pu(VI) content to increase; 2) At low dissolution temperatures, 
the Pu(VI) content is also low; 3) The Pu(VI) content in the 
mechanically blended pellets is higher than in the 
coprecipitated pellets.

<H5>  III. Conclusion </H5>
  1. With some exceptions, the pellets in the research 
dissolved easily in boiling 12 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/]. 
  2. When the dissolution acidity was reduced from 12 mol/l to 
4 mol/l, there was a significant reduction in the dissolution 
rate of the UO[.sub]2[/] and (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets. 
  3. Below the boiling point, the dissolution rate of the 
UO[.sub]2[/] and (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets in 12 mol/l 
HNO[.sub]3[/] was faster than at 100C. 
  4. The dissolution rate of the 27 percent 
PuO[.sub]2[/]-UO[.sub]2[/] pellets in boiling 12 mol/l 
HNO[.sub]3[/] was faster than the 35 percent 
PuO[.sub]2[/]-UO[.sub]2[/] pellets. 
  5. Under the experimental conditions, the dissolution rate 
of 
the mechanically blended pellets was slightly faster than the 
dissolution rate of the coprecipitated pellets. 
  6. In the dissolution experiments on the mechanically 
blended 
pellets, a uranium optimum solution phenomenon was observed. 
  7. When the 27 percent PuO[.sub]2[/]-UO[.sub]2[/] 
pellets were dissolved for five hours in boiling 12 mol/l 
HNO[.sub]3[/], the solution retained a small amount of 
undissolved residues. The content was 0.1 to 0.5 percent for the 
coprecipitated pellets and 0.3 to 1.6 percent for the 
mechanically blended pellets. 
  8. All of the (U,Pu)O[.sub]2[/] pellets and the 
undissolved residues in the experiments dissolved easily in 
boiling 12 mol/l HNO[.sub]3[/]-0.05 mol/l HF. 
  9. The plutonium in the solution exists mainly as Pu(IV) 
while the Pu(VI) content varies with pellet processing methods 
and dissolution conditions and increases as the dissolution time 
is increased. Dissolved for five hours in boiling 12 mol/l 
HNO[.sub]3[/], the Pu(VI) content can reach 30 percent.
