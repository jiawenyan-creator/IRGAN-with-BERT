FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Textron net almost flat at
Dollars 66.4m
TEXTRON, the US aerospace and financial services group, yesterday reported
static profits for the first quarter of 1991. It made Dollars 66.4m after
tax, compared with Dollars 66.2m in the same period a year earlier.
Sales in the quarter to the end of March rose modestly, from Dollars 1.88bn
to Dollars 1.91bn, while earnings per share progressed slightly to 76 cents,
against 73 cents. With the earnings figure roughly in line with analysts'
expectations, the shares eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 31.
Textron said both the Bell helicopter and financial services divisions fared
well, but its commercial products division was hit by the slump in 'consumer
confidence'.
The financial services operations made Dollars 80.9m, against Dollars 71.4m,
while helicopters turned in Dollars 37.8m, against Dollars 16.5m. The
commercial products side, by contrast, slumped from Dollars 46.8m to Dollars
20.5m.
Part of the shortfall was related to the unhappy saga of Textron's
acquisition of Avdel, the UK fasteners group, in 1989. Due to Federal Trade
Commission opposition to the merger, Textron has never been able to
consolidate Avdel's profits, although it has dividend income from the UK
business to the parent company.
In the first quarter of 1991, however, this income amounted to only Dollars
200,000, compared with Dollars 6.1m in 1990. Avdel made profits of Dollars
22m before tax last year.
