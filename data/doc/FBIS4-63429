  [Text] Flight Control Center, 23 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The 
flight of the unmanned transport craft "Progress M-22" has been 
completed. The separation of the space cargo craft from the 
"Mir" complex was effected at 0457 Moscow time today. After 
orientation in space and braking, with the aid of the craft's 
engine installation, the "Progress M-22" craft went into a 
descent trajectory, entered the dense layers of the Earth's 
atmosphere, and ended its existence. 
  For Viktor Afanasyev, Yuriy Usachev, and Valeriy Polyakov, a 
routine cycle of geophysical research is planned for today. The 
cosmonauts are to carry out surveys of the Earth's land masses 
and oceans and carry out a number of experiments to obtain 
information about the state of the Earth's ozone layer. 
  In order to determine the dynamic characteristics of the 
"Mir" complex, comprising a complicated space system, the 
"Rezonans" experiment will be carried out.
