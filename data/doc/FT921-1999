FT  21 MAR 92 / Letter: Labour tax proposals seen as an employment levy and
likely to hit property prices and feed inflation (1)
Sir, Could I warn John Smith, the shadow chancellor, that the extra 9 per
cent insurance charge, masquerading as a benefit, on those earning over
Pounds 21,060 will operate as a payroll and employment tax.
Employers will be forced to grant extra pay increases to critical qualified
staff in the Pounds 20.000-Pounds 30,000 band which will deflect money from
recruitment and make domestically produced goods and services more
expensive.
It will rekindle the 'grey economy' of tax avoidance, which the post-1988
tax regime had largely killed off, and is targeted to affect precisely those
groups whose support any government needs.
To impose a flat rate employment tax - that will in practice cost public and
private employers 5 per cent to 9 per cent on Pounds 20,000-plus payroll
costs - when we have a record number of qualified staff on the dole and a
very hesitant recovery shows a lack of understanding about the 'real jobs'
Mr Smith and his party want to encourage.
