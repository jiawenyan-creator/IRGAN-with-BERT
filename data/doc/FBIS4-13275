  [Excerpts] Today's guest at the Knesset Foreign Affairs 
and Defense Committee was Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Our 
correspondent Hayim Hecht reports on today's proceedings: 
  [Begin recording] [Hecht] The Golan Heights was the main 
issue discussed at today's session. Opposition members demanded 
that the prime minister disclose the working papers prepared by 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], the Foreign Ministry, and what 
they defined as another government-affiliated body. Yitzhaq 
Rabin said: No working papers, just data collection. 
  [Rabin] Various working papers that were drafted over the 
years have now been put together. These papers do not amount to 
plans but rather are meant to provide the political echelon with 
data in order to reach decisions. This is how all these papers 
should be regarded. Neither the Army nor any other government 
body deals with political issues. Each body is in charge of a 
specific field, but when it comes to issues that are first and 
foremost of a security nature, they follow the guidance of the 
political echelon. They only prepare data, nothing else. 
  [Hecht] Binyamin Netanyahu disclosed information according 
to which the 6,000 Palestinian policemen who will arrive in Gaza 
in the next few days will be permitted to bring their family 
members. Netanyahu claims this amounts to exercising the right 
of return. [passage omitted] 
  [Rabin] I agreed that those who will come from abroad on 
specific dates may bring their immediate relatives with them. 
More than 750,000 Palestinians live in Gaza; I do not think 
another 20,000-30,000 will make any difference. I have no 
problem with their coming to Gaza. 
  [Hecht] Referring to the cooperation between Fatah and Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement], Rabin said he cannot prevent 
Palestinians from talking to each other, but if this talk leads 
to attacks, this will constitute a red line for us. [end
