MORNING REPORT: ART 
Two young women who posed for paintings shown in China's first major art 
exhibit of nudes have hired lawyers and threatened to sue the exhibit's 
sponsors because they failed to ask permission before "exposing the models' 
secrets." Beijing newspapers on Thursday quoted the unidentified models as 
saying that since the exhibit opened Dec. 22 at the China Art Gallery in the 
capital, their husbands have thrown them out of their homes and asked for 
divorces. The Legal Daily News reported that the models are asking for an 
apology and for financial compensation. The exhibit of nearly 140 paintings of 
nudes, ranging from portraits to abstracts, has drawn record crowds expected to 
surpass a total of 150,000 before it closes next week. The exhibit charged an 
unusually high admission price of 2 yuan (53 cents); the models were paid 2.10 
yuan (57 cents) per hour for posing. ALEENE MacMINN
