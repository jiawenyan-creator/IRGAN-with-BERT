FT  04 JUN 93 / Aylwin makes Moscow peace
Russia's President Boris Yeltsin and Chilean President Patricio Aylwin
formally buried two decades of hostility between Moscow and Santiago
yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow.
The two leaders signed a declaration on principles governing future
relations and a series of inter-governmental agreements. The meeting capped
a general recovery in relations since the departure from power in 1990 of
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.
Mr Aylwin, who is on a general European tour, is the first Chilean head of
state to visit Moscow since the late Marxist President Salvador Allende came
in 1972.
