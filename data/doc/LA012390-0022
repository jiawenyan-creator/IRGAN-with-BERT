ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS 
Diceon Electronics Inc.: The Irvine-based manufacturer of circuit boards and 
backpanels lost $1.2 million for the first fiscal quarter, contrasted with a 
profit of $237,000 for the comparable period last year. 
Sales for the quarter ended Dec. 30 declined 13%, to $26.8 million from $30.7 
million. The current year figures include the results from a company it 
acquired in November. Diceon said the main reason for its low rate of orders is 
the continuing slowdown of business in the computer industry at all levels.
