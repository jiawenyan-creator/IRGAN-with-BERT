FT  27 OCT 93 / Canadian Elections: Quebec 'headed towards freedom'
MR Lucien Bouchard, leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, was in no doubt
as to the import of his party's strong showing in Monday's poll. 'This
election is a pivotal point in the process towards sovereignty. Independence
is the only remaining option after Canadians twice failed to amend the
constitution to accommodate Quebec nationalism,' he said.
The new parliament would reflect the real nature of Canada. 'There are two
countries in Canada. Starting today these two countries must begin talking
together more frankly right in parliament.'
A former member of Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's cabinet, Mr
Bouchard walked out in 1990 over the Meech Lake constitutional accord, on
the grounds that Quebec did not get enough out of the plan.
In the three years since he has built the BQ into the most popular party in
the province and the legitimate voice in parliament of most of its
French-speaking majority.
Yet despite the BQ's impressive sweep of 54 of the province's 75 seats,
federalists in Quebec have far from given up the fight. Mr Bernard Roy,
former chief of Cabinet for Premier Brian Mulroney and head of the Montreal
Chamber of Commerce, said: 'English Canada will never tolerate a separatist
party in the Commons forming the official Opposition.' How can the Bloc
represent all Canada? The Bloc got two-thirds of the Quebec seats with only
half the vote. We've see primarily a protest vote.'
Mr Bouchard was careful to preserve a conciliatory tone when he addressed
party workers in his campaign headquarters in Alma, Quebec. 'We're not out
to destroy federal institutions and Canada, but to win a better deal for
Quebec,' he said in English.
