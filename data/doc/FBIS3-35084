  [Text] In an interview with THE NEW YORK TIMES, PLO leader 
Yasir 'Arafat sharply criticized the United States for refusing 
to intervene in the negotiations between Israel and the PLO to 
ensure the implementation of their agreement. He reiterated his 
accusation that Israel is handing out large quantities of 
weapons in the territories to provoke a civil war among the 
Palestinians after its withdrawal. According to him, this is a 
well-planned operation being carried out under the auspices of 
several Israeli officers in the territories. Deputy Foreign 
Minister Yosi Beilin categorically denied 'Arafat's allegations: 
  [Begin Beilin recording] The very fact that 'Arafat makes 
such remarks today certainly cannot add to the kind of good 
atmosphere we need to complete the negotiations. I consider it 
a big mistake on his part, and I hope it will not hinder the 
completion of the negotiations so that we may wrap up all the 
issues on the agenda with regard to Gaza and Jericho and proceed 
to implement the decisions we have made. [end recording]
