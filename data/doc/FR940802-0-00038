1Peak market share for ethanol blended in any month in 1993 based on IRI data (assuming ethanol blended at 10 vol%).


2Wintertime ethanol only and no ETBE capacity. 

3Peak ethanol volume blended in any month in 1993 (based on IRI data) extrapolated over the winter season, expressed
as millions of gallons.


4Assumes ethanol blended at 3.5 wt% oxygen. 

5Phase-in would require total of 15% in 1995 and 30% in 1996; percentages are based on proration of ethanol content
to 2.0 wt% oxygen.
