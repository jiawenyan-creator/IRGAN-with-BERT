SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On December 17, 1993, the Commission issued Rel. Nos. 337038 and IC19959 (Dec. 17, 1993) [58 FR 68585
(Dec. 28, 1993)] (``Release No. 19959''), which proposed amendments to rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 and related rules and forms. The proposed amendments would tighten the risk-limiting conditions imposed
on tax exempt money market funds by rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940; impose additional disclosure
requirements on tax exempt funds; and make certain other changes to the Commission rules and forms applicable to all
money market funds. The amendments are designed both to reduce the likelihood that a tax exempt fund will not be able
to maintain a stable net asset value and to increase investor awareness of the risks of investment in a money market
fund.




Since Release No. 19959 was published, the Commission has received two requests from interested persons for an extension
of the comment period. In light of the importance of the amendments to money market funds and the short-term tax exempt
securities markets and the benefits to the Commission of receiving carefully considered comments, the Commission
believes a one month extension of the comment period is appropriate.

The comment period for responding to Release No. 19959 is extended to May 6, 1994.






By the Commission.
