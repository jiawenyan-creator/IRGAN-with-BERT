MORNING REPORT: FESTIVAL WATCH 
L.A. Festival Details: While still declaring that they will wait until February 
to confirm any programming decisions, Los Angeles Festival organizers are 
beginning to leak more details about the September, 1990, festival. According 
to new programming director Claire Peeps, the Pacific-themed festival will host 
25 to 30 visiting performing companies, and will include 25 to 40 curated 
events featuring local artists. In addition, about 40 films by at least 30 
local and international film makers will be shown. General Manager Michael 
Vargas said that a total of about 200 international artists from "at least 25 
nations" will perform at the festival, and that all the international artists 
will be housed in an artists' village at UCLA. The organizers said that 
confirming the attendance of the 32-member National Dance Company of Cambodia 
was "the thorniest" of all programming activities. But according to Executive 
Director Judith Luther, who has been negotiating the matter with U.S. diplomats 
(the United States does not recognize the Cambodian government): "I think that 
if civil war does not erupt there again, we will be able to bring the artists 
back. I don't think the (U.S.) government is going to take a hard and fast 
stance against (it)." SHAUNA SNOW
