FT  30 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Postal workers to be balloted on
action
ENGINEERING and main-tenance workers in the postal service are to be
balloted next week on national industrial action after the dismissal of two
engineers in Liverpool for going home early.
Up to 10,000 employees of Royal Mail Engineering and Construction (Romec),
Royal Mail and Motor Transport divisions may be involved if the action goes
ahead.
The dispute started last October when two engineers in Liverpool completed a
job early. The National Communications Union says there was no other work
available and the men went home with the permission of their manager. The
NCU said the men were dismissed when a more senior manager found out.
Mr Phil Holt, NCU Merseyside branch secretary, said that the practice of
'job and finish' was endemic. Only a minority of places did not operate the
system, he said.
Romec said yesterday that it regarded industrial action as unnecessary and
that the logical course for the union was to take the matter to an
industrial tribunal. It added that all the agreed internal disciplinary
procedures had been followed.
Royal Mail said it would 'do its utmost to minimise the effect on
customers'.
Postal services on Merseyside have already been disrupted by the dispute,
with members of the Union of Communication Workers, the main postal workers'
union, supporting local action.
The UCW was yesterday attempting to get an injunction against the action
lifted in the High Court.
The ballot of NCU members comes as a ballot for industrial action by the UCW
of 14,500 Post Office counter and clerical employees gets under way. The UCW
has rejected a 6.8 per cent pay offer.
