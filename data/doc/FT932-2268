FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Beales shares fall 27p on warning
Shares in Beales Hunter fell 27p to close at 265p yesterday after the
refrigeration and electrical components company warned that profits for the
year to May 31 would be 'slightly below' the Pounds 2.3m achieved last time.
The company said that trading levels in the refrigeration division had been
held back by poor weather conditions which affected the level of service
activity, and by a loss on a contract completed at its Rock Refrigeration
subsidiary.
The group's financial position remained strong and trading in the
refrigeration division had improved in June with service activity back to
expected levels, it said.
