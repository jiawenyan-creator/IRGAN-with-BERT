  [Text] Recently, more than 200 clandestine immigrants were 
intercepted by members of the National Gendarmerie. On 2 
February, they were assembled at the Rebouket Camp for 
repatriation. 
  Authorities from the Nigerian Embassy, whose countrymen 
constituted the largest number of intercepted immigrants, 
visited the latter and promised to make the necessary 
arrangements for their return. When the cells were opened early 
Thursday, 3 February, the gendarmes were surprised to observe 
that several of the the immigrants were dead. 
  As soon as it was notified about this tragedy, the 
government 
immediately informed the diplomatic authorities of the countries 
concerned, who proceeded to the scene of the incident. In 
agreement with these diplomatic authorities, the victims were 
given a proper burial. 
  Furthermore, aware of our country's reputation, the 
government decided today, 4 February, to rapidly set up a 
commission of inquiry.
