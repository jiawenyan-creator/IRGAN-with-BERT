FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Irish Permanent plans October
flotation
Irish Permanent, Ireland's largest building society before it converted to
plc status, is coming to the market late next month.
The company is planning to raise IPounds 50m (Pounds 49.4m) capital and is
expected to be capitalised at IPounds 182.9m. Just under half the shares are
being made available to people who were members of Irish Permanent when it
was a mutual organisation, while the remainder have been placed with
institutions in Dublin and London.
Mr Roy Douglas, chief executive, has made it clear that the society's
decision to become a public company was based primarily on the desire to be
able to raise equity capital, in order to compete more effectively with
banks.
He has emphasised, however, that Irish Permanent would not actively be
seeking acquisitions after conversion. Instead it would be looking for a
period of consolidation, after its recent purchases of Prudential Life of
Ireland, the life insurance company, and Guinness &amp; Mahon, where the main
activity is private banking.
Its strategy is to continue to expand its retail financial services
business, broadening its range of services and making more use of its
extensive branch network.
With some 79,000 mortgage accounts and 590,000 savings accounts, Irish
Permanent has a strong position in the Irish retail financial market, but
its cost/income ratio is the highest in the industry in Ireland.
Some 30.8m shares are being offered at 180p each. A forecast final dividend
for the year to December is 6p, giving an annualised gross dividend at the
offer price of 6.67 per cent.
