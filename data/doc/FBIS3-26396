  [Text] Washington, February 6 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton met today with senior aides on how to tackle the 
worsening violence in Bosnia amid rising calls for air strikes. 
  However, few people believe that the option of air strikes 
would be taken any time soon, taking into account the thousands 
of lightly-armed U.N. troops in the Balkan Republic. 
  A mortar shell exploded Saturday [5 February] at a crowded 
market in Sarajevo, killing at least 68 people and wounding more 
than 200, the largest single civilian casualties since war broke 
in the former Yugoslav Republic 22 months ago. 
  Washington condemned the "cowardly act" and urged the U.N. 
for speedy identification of those responsible. 
  "We do not rule out the use of NATO air strikes once 
responsibility has been fixed," Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher said Saturday in a written statement. 
  Christopher said he discussed the incident with British 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd yesterday and planned further 
consultation with other allies. 
  The U.S. sent an eight-member medical team and three cargo 
planes to Sarajevo earlier today to evacuate the victims. 
Pentagon said more help would be extended after injury 
assessment. 
  While threatening force, the U.S. reiterated calls for a 
negotiated settlement. 
  "It is time for responsible leaders among the warring 
factions to step forward and be counted. It is time for the 
international community to stand together and bring the maximum 
pressure to bear," William Perry, the new U.S. defense 
secretary, said at a conference in Munich, Germany.
