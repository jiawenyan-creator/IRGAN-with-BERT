JOE MILLER FIRED AS SAN CLEMENTE COACH 
Joe Miller was fired as the baseball coach at San Clemente High School, the 
school's athletic director, Jim McNaught, said Monday. 
Miller was dismissed from his position in June, at the end of the school year. 
The Tritons were 22-64-1 overall during Miller's four years as coach. San 
Clemente was 13-47 in South Coast League play during that time and never 
finished higher than fifth place. 
McNaught said Miller's won-loss record had nothing to do with the dismissal, 
which was handled by principal Jim Krembus. 
Miller, who was the head coach at Fountain Valley in 1982, will remain at the 
school as a science teacher. 
McNaught said he expected a new coach would be hired before the start of the 
school year. He said Krembus was in the process of interviewing candidates for 
the job. CHRIS FOSTER
