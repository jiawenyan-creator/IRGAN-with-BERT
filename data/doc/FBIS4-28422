  [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The Japanese 
authorities' moves against the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan 
(Chongnyon) have come under fire in different countries. 
  Chairman of the National Liberation War Veterans Committee 
of 
Zimbabwe Charles Hongwe in a statement May 24 charged that the 
Japanese authorities were intensifying their crackdown on 
Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan as never before as part of their 
hostile policy towards Korea. 
  Emmanuel Haber, chairman of the Malta-Korea Friendship 
Association, in a protest letter to the Japanese chief 
executive May 22 said the suppression of the Koreans in Japan 
who should be granted special protection by the Japanese 
authorities is a violation of human rights that contravenes the 
principles of international law. 
  The chief of staff of the music school of the People's 
Forces 
for the Liberation of Mozambique in a statement May 25 said the 
Japanese authorities' crackdown on Chongnyon is aimed at 
tarnishing the dignity and image of the socialist Korea and 
attaining their dishonest political and military aims. He urged 
that the Japanese reactionaries should repent of their crimes 
and stop at once the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign.
