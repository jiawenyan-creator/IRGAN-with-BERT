  [Excerpts] Baghdad, 5 Jan (INA)--The Central Committee of 
the [pro-Iraq] Kurdistan Democratic Party has warned against the 
conspiratorial Western scheme targeting the accomplishments of 
the eternal 17-30 July revolution, and the gains made by the 
population of the Autonomous Region in northern Iraq. 
  This came in a final statement issued by the committee after 
an extraordinary meeting held to discuss the deteriorating 
situation experienced by our people in the Autonomous Region of 
Kurdistan. 
  The statement said: Our Kurdish people in the Autonomous 
Region of Iraqi Kurdistan are currently experiencing a 
catastrophic and miserable situation brought about by a 
malicious U.S.-British-Zionist scheme, the implementation of 
which was assigned to many parties whose common interests lie in 
fueling an inter-Kurdish war. 
  The statement added: This malicious Western scheme is meant 
to take revenge on great Iraq, its lofty people, and its wise 
leadership, particularly since the West has failed to achieve 
its evil objective of bringing Iraq to its knees in the 30-state 
aggression and successive chapters of aggression. 
  The statement went on to say: The parties that have 
exploited the tragic situation in the Autonomous Region of 
Kurdistan, which is living under the control of the agent 
cliques, harbor rancor toward the Kurdish people in particular, 
and Iraq in general. [passage omitted] 
  The statement affirmed that the Kurdistan Democratic Party 
is 
certain that our people, who have experienced hard times, as 
well as good times, cannot remain passive toward what is taking 
place in Turkey, nor can they remain silent over the ordeal our 
people are experiencing. For, they are bound to make a strong 
effort to return things to normal. The first thing they have to 
do, the statement noted, is to kick these agents off their land 
in order to bring about their humiliation and defeat, as well as 
the curse of both history and future generations. [passage
