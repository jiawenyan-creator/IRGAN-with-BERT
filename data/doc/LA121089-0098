'DEMOCRATS FIND NO LIFE IN THE PARTY' 
Re "Orange County Democrats Find No Life in the Party" (Nov. 26): Even without 
money, there is more life in the Orange County Democratic Party than the 
Republicans can buy. Next time visit one of our Central Committee meetings or 
other events to see just how much life we do have before you write such an 
inaccurate headline. 
Your reporter who wrote the story visited our last Central Committee meeting 
and told me that he thought the meeting was exciting. It's too bad the Los 
Angeles Times decided to focus on the negative. 
MIKE BALMAGES 
Chairman, Orange County Democratic Party
