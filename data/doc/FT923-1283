FT  24 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Brady urges more co-operation
MR Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, yesterday called for new forms
of international economic co-operation to deal with the dramatic change in
the size and complexity of the world's money markets.
Announcing a new study of global capital flows to be carried out by the
Group of Ten industrial nations, which he chairs, Mr Brady noted that daily
trading in the foreign exchange market now approaches Dollars 1,000bn
(Pounds 584bn).
'This is roughly double the total reserves of the major industrial countries
and well beyond the resources governments can bring to bear in the markets,'
he said.
Other countries have also suggested revamping economic co-operation
procedures, which recently have seemed powerless in the face of the turmoil
in forex markets.
