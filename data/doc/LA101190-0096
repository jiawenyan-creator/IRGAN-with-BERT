METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CASE DROPPED IN ASSAULT ON 2 MURDER 
SUSPECTS 
Prosecutors dropped their case Wednesday against a jail inmate who allegedly 
assaulted two Northridge college students accused of murdering a Pacoima 
pastor. 
Felony charges against Thaddeus K. Bonner, 36, were dismissed after a San 
Fernando Municipal judge ruled that Dana Singer, 18, and Philip J. Dimenno, 19, 
would not be required to testify against Bonner at a preliminary hearing. 
Attorneys for Singer and Dimenno argued that cross-examination of their clients 
during the preliminary hearing could have hurt efforts to defend them against 
charges that they murdered Pastor Carl White on July 28. 
"We couldn't make anything without the testimony of the two witnesses," Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Victor Minjares said, explaining the dismissal. 
Dimenno and Singer were injured in an assault Sept. 11 in an inmate lockup area 
of the San Fernando Courthouse.
