BUYOUTS 
Charles Morris' thoughtful column on leveraged buyouts (Opinion, Feb. 26) did 
not mention that most LBOs involve privately held companies. 
Each year an uncounted number of these companies pass from one owner to the 
next thanks to LBO financing. Generally, there are neither superfluous 
operations that can be sold to pay down debt nor a legion or unnecessary 
employees that can be dismissed to increase cash flow. Thus, even though the 
financing is secured by the company's assets, lenders won't provide funding 
unless the buyer can show that the resulting company can continue as an ongoing 
business. As a result, these private deals must be priced very conservatively. 
The alternative to most private LBOs is for the owner (often nearing retirement 
age) to close the company, fire its employees, and sell its machinery, real 
estate and account list. But a leveraged buyout saves the company -- as well as 
the jobs and the output of goods and services it provides. Properly structured, 
an LBO will enable the company to remain viable despite rising interest rates 
or slowdowns in the economy.
