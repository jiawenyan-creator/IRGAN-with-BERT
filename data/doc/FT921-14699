FT  15 JAN 92 / World Trade News: EC seeks a 10 per cent share of Japan's
market
THE automobile committee of the European Business Committee submitted a
statement yesterday to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
proposing a target of 10 per cent of the Japanese market for European cars
in 1995 and 17.5 per cent in 2000, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
European cars presently hold 4 per cent of Japan's car market.
The EBC is a Tokyo-based advisory committee to the European Community,
representing companies from EC member states doing business in Japan. The
proposed targets do not include Japanese-brand cars made in Europe.
Last week Japanese car makers announced plans to more than double their
purchases of US-made cars and car parts to Dollars 19bn (Pounds 10.6bn) by
1994/95. An EBC official said European car makers wanted the Japanese
government to buy cars, grant preferential tax treatment and revise
regulations on construction of dealerships.
