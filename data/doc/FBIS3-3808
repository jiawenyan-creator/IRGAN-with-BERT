  [Text] Hong Kong, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese side 
should rely more on Hong Kong compatriots in achieving a smooth 
transition of the territory, especially when the Sino-British 
cooperation has been sabotaged by the British side. 
  Zheng Guoxiong, deputy director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong 
Kong Branch, made the above remarks here today at a meeting 
attended by some newly-appointed Hong Kong district affairs 
advisors. 
  Recently the Chinese side has appointed 274 local residents 
as its advisors on district affairs in the territory. 
Appointment of these advisors is mainly designed to help China 
solicit opinions and advices from local residents on the Hong 
Kong issue. 
  Zheng encouraged these newly-appointed advisors to 
participate actively in activities which are conducive to the 
smooth transition of Hong Kong so as to create a good condition 
for the smooth transfer of power in the territory in 1997. 
  During the meeting, Zheng also briefed them on the recent 
breakdown of the Sino-British talks over the 1994-95 electoral 
arrangements in the territory. 
  He said that the political reform bill which the British 
side 
has adhered to is in violation of the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration, the Basic Law and the agreements and understandings 
reached between the two countries. 
  The real intention of the British side, he continued, was to 
create obstacles for the smooth transition of Hong Kong during 
its remaining administration days by stirring up discords and 
chaos in the territory under the disguise of democracy. 
  At the meeting, many district affairs advisors expressed 
their willingness to actively cooperate with the Chinese side to 
ensure a smooth transition of Hong Kong and maintain its 
long-term prosperity and stability.
