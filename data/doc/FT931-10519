FT  08 FEB 93 / Madrid hints at fall in interest rates this week
THE Spanish government has hinted that official interest rates in the
country may fall in the next few days following the reduction in German
interest rates last week.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister, said at the weekend that while it was
up to the Bank of Spain to decide whether to trim its official intervention
rate from 13.25 per cent this week, sharp falls in Spanish interbank rates
after the German cuts meant the market was already discounting a Spanish
cut.
The government, which in this election year is under pressure to stimulate
an economic recovery, would welcome any help from the Bank of Spain.
Mr Solchaga announced at the weekend that the economy had grown just 1.2 per
cent last year. The minister believes that, at best, gross domestic product
will grow 1 per cent in 1993.
Mr Solchaga said unemployment had risen from 16.3 per cent to 18.2 per cent
last year, badly missing the target contained in Spain's plan to converge
its economy with leading countries of the European Community. The plan had
aimed at GDP growth of 3 per cent for 1992.
Adding further evidence to fears that Spain may actually have entered a
recession in the last few months of 1992, Mr Solchaga said fixed capital
formation had fallen 2.7 per cent for the year, rather than rising 3.2 per
cent rise as initially forecast. Fixed capital formation fell rapidly in the
second half of 1992, by 4.1 per cent.
Despite triumphant sniping from political critics, however, the government
believes it has a real chance of ending this year with a recovery under way.
Economic stagnation and the early implementation of tax increases in 1992
should hold prices well in check this year, making significant interest rate
cuts possible.
The government has also taken some heart from figures showing it managed to
hold the general government deficit to 4.4 per cent of GDP last year.
