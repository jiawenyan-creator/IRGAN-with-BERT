  [Excerpt] Ankara, May 11 (AA) -- The Foreign Ministry on 
Tuesday [10 May] said it had no information about a U.N. letter 
to the Security Council regarding the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline. 
  Ministry officials said that U.N. officials sent a letter to 
the Security Council on Monday expressing a U.N. commission's 
financial distress, but the letter did not mention Turkey or the 
pipeline. 
  U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said on Tuesday 
that he wanted to ask oil companies to trace sales of Iraqi 
crude so that the United Nations receives a 30 percent cut for 
its compensation fund for post-Gulf war expenses, according to a 
letter obtained Monday. 
  In response, the Security Council was expected to approve a 
letter Tuesday telling him to check with oil industry sources on 
any Iraqi crude impounded, sold, or used after the first 
sanctions resolution was adopted August 6, 1990. 
  Butrus-Ghali, in his letter sent last week, said reports 
from 
oil industry sources suggested that hundreds of millions of 
dollars of crude were involved after the sanctions went into 
effect without any payment into a U.N. escrow fund. [passage
