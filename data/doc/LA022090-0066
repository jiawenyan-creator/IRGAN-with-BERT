SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: MISL ALL-STARS AT CLEVELAND IN '92 
The expansion Cleveland Crunch will be host to the 1992 Major Indoor Soccer 
League All-Star Game, Commissioner Earl Foreman said Monday in San Diego. 
No date has been set because the league first wants to wrap up contract 
negotiations on a television deal with ESPN, which wants to televise the 1992 
game live. 
This year's All-Star Game is at the San Diego Sports Arena at 7:45 Wednesday 
night and the 1991 game is in Kansas City. 
ESPN will televise MISL playoff games on May 2, 17, 24, 27 and June 9. The last 
game is expected to be broadcast live. The others tape-delayed, but shown the 
same day.
