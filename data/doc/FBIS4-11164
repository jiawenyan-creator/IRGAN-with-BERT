    [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 1155 GMT on 22 April carries an eight-minute interview with 
Agustin Lopez Gomez, secretary general of the Communications 
Workers Union, by Radio Rebelde General Manager Bienvenido Rojas. 
  Lopez points out that as a result of the workers' assemblies 
process, there is an increased awareness among workers of the 
importance of maintenance, given the age and origin of the 
equipment. Maintenance is necesesary to minimize technical 
difficulties and improve service. 
  Lopez adds that the work is extensive and improvement is not 
readily seen. With regard to ties with foreign companies, Lopez 
states: "We understand that the government is making some type 
of effort on this. However, we are working to reshape the 
managerial organization of the communications systems. We have 
begun by reorganizing the National Telephone Service: in other 
words, the creation of a national enterprise, which is to be 
followed by the same with the postal, telegraph, radio, and 
television systems." 
  Lopez adds: "The telephone system was fragmented into about 
15 enterprises, and now there is only one, at the national 
level."
