<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes to revise the gust load design requirements for transport category airplanes. The proposed
changes would: (1) replace the current discrete gust requirement with a new requirement for a discrete tuned gust;
(2) modify the method of establishing the design airspeed for maximum gust intensity; and (3) provide for an operational
rough air speed. These changes are proposed in order to provide a more rational basis to account for the aerodynamic
and structural dynamic characteristics of the airplane. These proposed changes would also provide for harmonization
of the discrete gust requirements with the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR) of Europe as recently amended.
