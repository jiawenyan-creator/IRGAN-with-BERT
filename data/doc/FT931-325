FT  30 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt's volume fails to
match share prices
BOURSES were reactive in character, writes Our Markets Staff. Frankfurt rose
after last week's falls; Paris returned to the upgrade after Wall Street
came in higher; and the drop in the lira to a new record low weighed on a
lethargic Milan.
FRANKFURT saw higher financials and chemicals, constructions and steels as
the DAX index closed 13.63 higher at 1,674.92. However, dealers said that
prices were not matched by volume; turnover dropped from DM7.2bn to DM4.7bn.
Financials reflected interest rate hopes again after a fortnight of
underperformance, Commerzbank rising DM4.50 to DM297.50. Bayer and Schering
led chemicals, the former after relative weakness on Friday as brokers
Julius Bar in Frankfurt noted a developing taste for cyclicals.
Among steels, Thyssen rose DM3.40 to DM171 on the hope that the current
round of price increases might stick. In constructions, Hochtief led with a
DM21 rise to DM1,153 as German mortgage banks put out encouraging figures on
new housebuilding loan approvals.
Tertiary stocks saw falls in Continental and AEG, the former down DM3.60 to
DM214 after the state of Lower Saxony said that it will detail a plan to buy
Pirelli's stake in Conti tomorrow - ignoring Pirelli's trumpeted price of
DM230 a share - and AEG responded to a negative weekend report. However,
Bremer Vulkan rose DM4.10 to DM79 as rumours of a big shipbuilding contract
for China were revived.
PARIS was helped in the afternoon by futures-linked buying, particularly by
US brokers, and the CAC 40 index closed 8.08 higher at 2,033.86 after an
earlier low of 2,013.33, and a high of 2,045.31.
Turnover was FFr3.15bn. Rumours abounded, said Mr Michael Woodcock, French
market analyst at Nikko Europe. Features included the hotel group, Accor,
down FFr29 to FFr688 although it denied talk of a rights issue; a similar
tale left Eurotunnel 90 centimes lower at FFr41.25. Conversely, a story that
Carnaud Metal Box had sold its MB Caradon stake at FFr200 a share left the
former FFr6 higher at FFr213.80.
Elsewhere, Alcatel was FFr9 higher at FFr665 as its cable subsidiary
announced a Greek contract. There were buyers around for Eurodisney, FFr2.10
higher at FFr94 as its prospects seemed to improve, and Credit National rose
FFr17 to FFr1,320 as 2 per cent of the equity went through the market
towards the end of the day.
MILAN was paralysed by a work slowdown, traders protesting at an unexpected
change in trading procedures as the bourse prepare to expand screen based
trading. The Comit index edged 0.55 higher at 487.07.
Fiat added L150 to L5,850 as rumours of an international disposal continued.
Analysts noted that the shares were quoted at L5,890 on SEAQ International,
the screen-based trading system for international stocks in London.
Benetton dipped L220 to L15,080: its 12 per cent rise in 1992 net profit
came after the market closed .
ZURICH was lifted by anticipation of this week's corporate results, and the
SMI index rose 16.3 to 2,176.3.
Ciba registered rose SFr5 to SFr614 ahead of today's results, expected to
include a healthy rise in profits. Roche, reporting on Thursday, rose SFr40
to SFr4,104. Adia was not so lucky after last Friday's figures and its
warning of a possible loss for 1993; the bearers fell SFr13 to SFr120.
Meanwhile, Leu Holding gained SFr20 to SFr395 and Elektrowatt SFr60 to
SFr2,850 on rumours that CS Holding, their parent company, intended to
divest its interests. CS Holding, which denied the reports, closed SFr40
higher at SFr2,290.
AMSTERDAM moved Nutricia, the specialist food group, to centre stage after
Friday's results but the CBS Tendency index was unchanged at 106.40
reflecting the otherwise thin trade.
Nutricia, whose 1992 results were in line with expectations, added Fl 6.50
or 5.4 per cent to Fl 125.50 with investors encouraged by its forecasts for
1993.
Heineken rose Fl 1.20 to Fl 192.50 after a day's high of Fl 194.20, with
foreign demand noted after a positive article in Barrons.
KLM dipped 10 cents to Fl 28.10 in response to suggestions yesterday that
the resignation of the finance director, late on Friday was due to
differences of opinion over company strategy.
MADRID closed with the general index 1.14 higher at 239.79 in healthy
turnover of Pta21.73bn, dealers saying that the market had reached a key
resistance level.
Construction companies were among the day's strongest performers, Cubiertas
putting on Pta400, or 7.3 per cent to Pta5,840 Agroman, Asland and Dragados
all rising by more than 3 per cent. Real estate companies were also healthy.
Bami and Prima Inmobiliaria each advancing by more than 5 per cent.
OSLO registered a 10-month high, the all-share index edging up 1.25 to
450.77 in active turnover worth NKr375.2m on the expectation of further
falls in interest rates.
ISTANBUL scored a 1.9 per cent gain after its six-day holiday, the market
index rising 108.51 to 5,764.94.
