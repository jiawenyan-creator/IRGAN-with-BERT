FT  18 MAR 93 / S Korean relief over chip duties
SOUTH Korean semiconductor makers yesterday expressed relief that dumping
duties imposed by the US on their memory chips are far lower than expected.
The industry, one of South Korea's biggest exporters, said the duties,
averaging 3.19 per cent, would have a minimal impact on sales of dynamic
random access memory (D-Ram) chips in the US, their biggest foreign market.
The US Commerce Department on Tuesday drastically lowered preliminary
dumping duties imposed last October on Korea's three main semiconductor
companies for unfair pricing of D-Ram chips.
The duty for Samsung Electronics, South Korea's biggest semiconductor
company, was cut from 87.4 per cent to 0.74 per cent, while that for
Goldstar Electron fell from 52.41 per cent to 4.97 per cent.
However, Hyundai Electronics faces a higher penalty of 7.19 per cent (5.99
per cent).
Exports to the US totalled Dollars 854m (Pounds 601m) last year and the
Korean producers had expected penalties of at least 10 per cent. They and
their US computer industry customers argued high dumping duties would drive
up semiconductor prices and harm ailing US computer makers.
Semiconductor prices in the US have already risen 20 per cent since the
preliminary duties against the Korean chip makers were announced.
