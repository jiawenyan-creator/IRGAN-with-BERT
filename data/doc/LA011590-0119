NATION; 
FEW EXPECTED AT SHUTTLE LANDING 
Fewer than 2,000 spectators are expected when the space shuttle Columbia, 
loaded with a bus-sized satellite, makes its late-night landing this week on 
the Mojave Desert. 
The landing, scheduled for 11:59 p.m. Thursday, will be only the second at 
night for a shuttle. Columbia, which has no running lights, will touch down on 
a concrete runway about five miles from the public viewing area. 
"You'll hear a 'whoosh' sound as it comes through the air but you won't see 
it," so no more than 2,000 people are expected, NASA spokeswoman Nancy Lovato 
said.
