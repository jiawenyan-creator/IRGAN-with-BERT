<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to the Military Lands Withdrawal Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99606), the Department of the Interior, Bureau
of Land Management, Steese/White Mountains District has prepared a Proposed Resource Management Plan (PRMP)/Final
Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the Fort Greely military withdrawal, which is located near Delta Junction,
Alaska, southeast of Fairbanks. The U.S. Army's 6th Infantry Division (Light) assisted in drafting the plan. The
document addresses planning for nonmilitary use of the withdrawal. It addresses questions such as access, recreation,
timber and fuel wood harvesting, and wildlife habitat and cultural resource protection. Although mining is discussed,
none would be allowed in the immediate future because of potential conflicts with the military's mission.
