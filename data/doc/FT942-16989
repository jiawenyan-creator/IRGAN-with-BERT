FT  07 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Storms over the Channel
Eurotunnel's broadside against a luckless corporate financier, who talked
indiscreetly about its forthcoming rights issue, will enhance Swiss Bank
Corporation's maverick reputation. Yet despite the ticking-off, SBC will
retain an important role in Eurotunnel's fund-raising. Its agreement to
sub-underwrite Transmanche Link's portion of the rights issue helped cement
a deal between contractor and builder. SBC is also likely to play a big role
in the global distribution of shares.
SBC has trodden on the toes of the City establishment before. It gatecrashed
BZW's enhanced scrip dividend party when it perceived the margins were too
fat and launched a competitive auction for the rump of Trafalgar House's
rights issue. At a general level, it would be a welcome development if SBC
could succeed in its attempts to inject some fresh thinking into the cosy
world of underwriting. After all, real competition is likely to provide a
more effective deterrent against the threat of cartels than strictures from
the Office of Fair Trading.
By applying its expertise in derivatives markets to assess the volatility of
a company's shares, SBC claims it can judge whether the standard 2 per cent
underwriting fee is appropriate to the risk. Such an approach has advantages
for favoured clients, which are guaranteed their money at less cost. The
danger is that by squeezing the fees on the good deals, SBC may upset the
institutions on which it must ultimately rely. In the interests of
self-preservation, most financial advisers have chosen to side with the fund
managers who have the money rather than the companies which need it.
