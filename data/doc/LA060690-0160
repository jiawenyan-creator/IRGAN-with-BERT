SHORT TAKES; 
CHARLIE ROSE SWITCHES TO FOX 
Charlie Rose is leaving the overnight CBS interview program "Nightwatch" for a 
daily interview show on the Fox network. 
The Emmy winner who has headed "Nightwatch" since it began in 1984 will join 
"Personalities" as its anchorman, Fox announced Tuesday. 
"Personalities" has already been cleared by 115 stations across the country for 
either late-afternoon or early evening airing, and is designed as a hard-news 
companion piece for "A Current Affair." It is described as the "first daily 
syndicated magazine focusing solely on people making headlines" in 
entertainment, politics, sports, business, communications and the arts. The 
program will be broadcast by satellite daily from Los Angeles. 
Rose, who signed a four-year contract with Fox, will finish his reign on the 
CBS News broadcast as of June 15. He will be replaced by a crew of rotating CBS 
correspondents until a permanent anchor is named. 
Rose has also been anchorman on "Face the Nation," "CBS Morning News," "CBS 
This Morning" and "Newsbreak."
