MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO 
When about 350 members of the Andy Griffith Show Appreciation Society got 
together over the weekend in Winston-Salem, N.C., for their annual convention, 
they took a trip 35 miles up the road to Mt. Airy, said to be the inspiration 
for some of the spots in the show's fictional town of Mayberry. What they 
noticed right off were some differences. Aunt Bea's eatery and Floyd's 
Barbershop had different names, but they did find a Snappy Grill on Main 
Street. Differences or not, one member, Linda Stewart of Dallas, said of the 
visit: "I can die happy now. Mostly I can relate to the life style, because we 
sit on the porch at home and rock, go to church, even eat the same kind of 
foods. I can't relate to shows today because we don't have cocktails every five 
minutes." Stewart, 47, has watched and videotaped all 200-plus episodes of the 
show that aired on CBS 1960-68. ALEENE MacMINN
