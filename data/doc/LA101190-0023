EARNINGS 
Argonaut Group Inc.: The Los Angeles-based holding company said its 
third-quarter net income slipped to $21.7 million from $22.7 million in the 
1989 period. Revenue rose 15% to $172.3 million. The firm, which sells, 
underwrites and services workers' compensation and property-casualty insurance, 
said the current year's revenue gains resulted primarily from the sale of 
investments in Earle M. Jorgensen Co. in response to a tender offer.
