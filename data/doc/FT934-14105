FT  19 OCT 93 / Clocks change 'causes deaths'
PUTTING THE clocks forward one hour in summer and winter, to bring Britain
in line with much of continental Europe, would reduce road deaths and save
more than Pounds 200m in health service costs, says an independent report
published yesterday.
The author of the report, Dr Mayer Hillman of the Policy Studies Institute,
says there is now an unarguable case for not altering the clocks next
weekend.
He says business would benefit from the change. Tourism could be Pounds 1bn
better off and travel and communications throughout Europe would be improved
if all the European Community countries, apart from Greece and Ireland,
adopted the same time zone.
The report, Time for Change, has been backed up by an NOP poll in which 59
per cent of those surveyed were in favour of switching to Central European
time, with darker mornings and lighter evenings to provide people with more
leisure time.
Dr Hillman also says that crime would be cut because opportunistic offences
normally carried out under cover of darkness take place less in the morning.
The report says that savings on electricity bills for lighting would be more
than Pounds 250m and generating costs would be reduced because of the
lowering of demand in the afternoons.
Dr Hillman concludes: 'Many of the grounds cited by the minority opposed to
the change are weak or ill-founded. A common tendency has been to highlight
the problems for people in locations of extreme latitude and longitude, and
in situations occurring in the depths of winter.'
He says that in 1971 the government discontinued a three-year experiment,
keeping clocks an hour ahead of Greenwich Mean Time in winter as well as
summer. By not abandoning the project, Dr Hillman says, the government may
have averted 20,000 deaths or injuries.
He adds that Britain is paying a high price for the 'understandable' dislike
of starting winter days with an additional hour in the dark.
