FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (19): Saying it with flowers -
The smart flower shops of Paris are surprisingly inexpensive, at least
compared with the markets and street stalls which often charge high prices
for indifferent blooms
ON almost every day of his adult life Marcel Proust called in at Lachaume,
the flower shop on rue Royale, to pick out a fresh orchid for his
buttonhole.
Lachaume has been selling flowers since the 1840s and is still one of Paris'
most famous florists today. Flower lovers with less traditional taste may
prefer to call in at Christian Tortu on rue Saint-Florentin and the
carrefour de l'Odeon, where he sculpts flowers, mosses and foliage into
bizarre, abstract shapes. Jean Vassal on rue du Bac is somewhere between the
two styles, with carefully structured concoctions of traditional blooms.
My favourite florist is Moulie-Savart on place du Palais Bourbon, a lovely
old-fashioned flower shop with big bunches of rustic blooms and glossy,
green leaves. Christian Lacroix, the fashion designer, buys his flowers here
 -in the same colours as his collections - as does Paris Vogue, which has
offices a few doors along on place du Palais-Bourbon.
Even the smallest Parisian florists wrap flowers beautifully in swathes of
cellophane tied with ribbon. The smart shops are surprisingly inexpensive,
at least compared to the markets and street stalls which often charge hefty
prices. The Marche aux Fleurs on the Ile de la Cite is lauded in the tourist
guides, but is actually rather dull with very high prices.
The smaller flower markets at place de la Madeleine and place des Ternes are
usually more appealing with a more imaginative selection and reasonable
prices. The Marche aux Ternes is open until quite late in the evening so, if
you need to pick up a posy or bouquet on your way to dinner, it is usually
worth considering a detour.
