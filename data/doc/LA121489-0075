CHOCOLATE ROLL: BIG WHEEL WITH A CHEESE FILLING 
This light, airy cake roll has rich chocolate flavor and is rolled around a 
fruited cheese and whipped cream filling. 
It is a perfect holiday party dessert. Make it a day ahead, wrap tightly in 
plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Bring back to room temperature by 
letting stand out about one hour and dust with powdered sugar before serving. 
FRUITED CHOCOLATE ROLL 
1 (16-ounce) can fruit cocktail in juice or extra light syrup 
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate pieces 
4 eggs 
3/4 cup granulated sugar 
1/2 cup flour 
1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
3 tablespoons cold coffee 
2 teaspoons vanilla 
1/4 teaspoon baking soda 
Powdered sugar 
1/2 cup whipping cream 
1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened 
1 teaspoon grated orange peel 
1/4 teaspoon almond extract 
Drain fruit cocktail, reserving liquid for other uses. Melt chocolate pieces 
over warm, not hot, water. 
Beat eggs in large bowl with granulated sugar until thick and light, about 10 
minutes. Add flour, baking powder and salt and blend well. Stir coffee, 1 
teaspoon vanilla and baking soda into melted chocolate and mix well. Fold into 
flour mixture. 
Line 15x10-inch jellyroll pan with foil. Lightly grease and flour pan and spoon 
batter into pan, smoothing top with spatula. Bake at 375 degrees 20 minutes. 
Sift 2 tablespoons powdered sugar over cake and cover with cloth towel. Turn 
upside-down and remove foil carefully from cake. Roll up jellyroll-fashion in 
towel, starting from short side. Cool. 
Beat whipping cream until stiff and set aside. Beat cream cheese with 1/4 cup 
powdered sugar, orange peel and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla and almond extract 
until smooth. Fold in whipping cream and fruit cocktail. Unroll cake roll and 
spread with fruit filling. Reroll. Dust with additional sifted powdered sugar, 
if desired. Makes 1 10-inch roll.
