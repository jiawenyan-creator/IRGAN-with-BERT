FT  16 APR 93 / US may sign Rio accord next week
THE US may announce its backing for the bio-diversity convention, which it
refused to sign at last year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, as early as
next week, according to US officials.
President Bill Clinton is expected to deliver a speech on environmental
policy next Wednesday, and some officials believe he may be ready by then to
announce the US's intention to sign the convention, which lays down
obligations to list, monitor and protect endangered species.
But the US wants to add an interpretative statement to its signature,
clarifying its view of ambiguities in the treaty on intellectual property
and financing mechanisms, and is keen to have the European Community and
other members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
sign on to this statement.
The treaty is open for signature until June 3.
White House environmental advisers last week gave a list of concerns to Mr
Svend Auken of Denmark, the current president of the EC council of
environment ministers, and are circulating a draft interpretative statement
they hope other governments might sign.
Many developed countries share US concerns about the vagueness of the treaty
language, and the EC had been planning to lodge its own statement.
Nevertheless, some of the proposed US language will need reworking if it is
to attract support.
At the heart of the US objections was the possibility that ambiguities in
the treaty could weaken the intellectual property rights of biotechnology
companies by forcing them to share the benefits of their research and
patents with the countries in which they found genetic material.
The US also objected to what it saw as an open-ended commitment to fund
bio-diversity protection in developing countries.
