FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc given share sale
timetable
THE French government said last night that the previously announced sale by
the state of at least 6m shares in Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals and drugs
company, would take place by February 1 next year, depending on market
conditions.
The sale, which is expected to raise between FFr3bn (Dollars 550m) and
FFr4bn, will be a watershed in French industrial policy because it will be
the first time that the country's socialist government has allowed its
direct holding in a state-controlled company to fall below 50 per cent.
France's finance minister, Mr Michel Sapin, said in last night's
announcement that the shares would be sold in four tranches:
At least 2.7m would be sold to the French public;
At least 1m shares would be placed on the US market;
At least 1.7m shares would be placed internationally;
At least 600,000 shares would be reserved for Rhone-Poulenc employees, who
would pay 10 per cent less per share than the public.
In France, small investors who apply for up to 10 shares will be given
preference in the allocation.
After the sale the state's direct voting rights will be reduced from 77.5
per cent to 45 per cent. The government will exercise indirect control
through stakes held by other state-controlled institutions, such as Credit
Lyonnais bank and Assurances Generales de France, the insurance group.
On Sunday, Rhone-Poulenc reported a third-quarter net loss of FFr133m
compared with a profit of FFr548m in the corresponding period of 1991. Net
income was hit by exchange rate fluctuations, primarily the US dollar's
decline against the French franc.
