TEXAS SITE IS OFFICIAL CHOICE FOR COLLIDER 
The Energy Department on Wednesday officially crowned Texas the winner of a 
multi-state battle to host a proposed $5.9-billion superconducting super 
collider. 
At a formal ceremony attended by Texas Gov. Bill Clements, John S. Herrington, 
the energy secretary, signed an official "record of decision" to build the 
massive physics installation around the city of Waxahachie, about 25 miles 
south of Dallas. 
California had been initially considered a leading contender for the collider, 
but was not a finalist. It had been eliminated due to concern about the 
geological stability of sites promoted by the state. 
The collider is envisioned as a 53-mile underground ring that would use 10,000 
magnets to whirl beams of protons into each other at energy levels 20 times 
what is possible in today's machines. 
Scientists will use the facility to explore the nature of matter and energy. It 
is to be called the Ronald Reagan Center for High-Energy Physics, although it 
remains uncertain whether Congress will give the go-ahead to begin 
construction. 
Last year, Congress agreed to spend $100 million on the collider, but it 
decreed that none of the money be spent on construction. In his budget proposal 
for the coming fiscal year, President Reagan requested $250 million for the 
collider, including $90 million for research and development and $160 million 
for construction. 
Herrington had declared last Nov. 10 that Texas was the "preferred site" for 
the project, but a waiting period was required before the choice was made 
official.
