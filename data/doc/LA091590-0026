TV GEOGRAPHY, UCLA FOOTBALL TEAM MATCH MARKS OF 'F' IN OPENER 
About the only good thing that happened to the UCLA Bruins in their dismal loss 
to Oklahoma was the end of their quarterback controversy. 
Redshirt freshman Tommy Maddox obviously should be that starting quarterback 
for the next four years. 
Should the UCLA coaching brain trust grasp this fact, they will then be able to 
devote their attention to where it is most needed: teaching the offensive line 
to block.
