FT  08 MAY 93 / Futures broker put into liquidation
DAVID COAKLEY, a London-based futures and options broker, was placed in
liquidation yesterday.
Mr Keith Goodman, a partner in Leonard Curtis, the chartered accountants and
insolvency experts, was appointed liquidator.
A spokeswoman for Leonard Curtis said clients were likely to get more than
90 per cent of their funds back.
The Securities and Futures Authority noted a shortfall of Pounds 249,034
from clients' funds but pointed out that private clients could claim the
balance of their funds from the Investors' Compensation Scheme.
The SFA banned David Coakley Ltd from conducting any kind of investment
business in December, apart from execution-only business for non-private
clients, business for clients whose investments were managed by commodity
trading advisers, as well as transactions necessary to close out other
client positions.
