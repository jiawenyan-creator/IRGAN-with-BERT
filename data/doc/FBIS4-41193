  [Text] The President of Tatarstan Mintimer Shaymiyev has 
supported the decree of President Yeltsin on combating crime. 
  "Much of what the decree provides for has been done in 
Tatarstan since April 1993 and produced noticeable, if not 
striking results," Shaymiyev told Interfax. 
  He said that after he was given special powers by the Tatar 
parliament and after extraordinary steps were taken to stamp out 
crime, law enforcement workers have overcome "the syndrome of 
fearing the underworld" and now control the situation. 
  Shaymiyev said the rate of unsolved crimes has grown from 49 
to 72 pct of the total number of registered crimes. He 
accounted the growth in the overall rate to stronger control 
over attempts by law enforcement bodies to underestimate the 
scale of crime. 
  President Yeltsin was informed about the experience in 
detail 
and the experience was approved by the Russian Interior Minister 
Viktor Yerin, the Tatar leader announced. 
  He admitted that certain excesses are possible in the 
process 
of enforcing the decree. Still "if we want to act adequately in 
the present situation, there is no other way today." 
  Shaymiyev thinks that the Council of the Federation and the 
State Duma must back the decree by appropriate laws and before 
that express their support.
