FT  29 MAR 93 / French Elections: Chirac's party in strong position to set
out terms
MR Jacques Chirac's Gaullist RPR party has become the largest single force
in the new French parliament, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. With 569 of
the 577 constituencies counted in yesterday's second round of voting for the
National Assembly, the RPR had 245 seats compared with 213 seats for the
UDF, its main partner in the conservative coalition.
Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the UDF, said his main ambition had
been for his party to get more than 200 seats. However, during the campaign
he said he had wanted parity with the RPR.
The RPR is now in an extremely strong bargaining position when it comes to
the choice of prime minister, who is selected by the French president but
who traditionally comes from the largest party in the National Assembly, and
also in the allocation of ministerial posts.
Mr Chirac, who was prime minister in the last cohabitation government from
1986 to 1988, has made it clear that he does not want the job again, saying
that the thought 'sends shivers down my spine'.
The RPR leader, who is now favourite to win the 1995 presidential elections,
does not want to risk a repetition of the embarrassing, humiliating clashes
with Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, which he believes cost him the
1988 presidential campaign.
However, Mr Chirac is keen for an RPR candidate to be chosen as prime
minister, preferably Mr Edouard Balladur, a mild-mannered man who served as
finance minister in the last conservative government. Last week Mr
Mitterrand threatened to choose a premier from outside the RPR if Mr Chirac
persisted in his calls for the president's resignation.
Mr Mitterrand is in principle still free to look outside the RPR for his
prime minister, but the scale of the Gaullists' lead over the UDF makes it
considerably less likely that he will do so.
The RPR's ascendancy should also help Mr Chirac in his bargaining with the
UDF over cabinet posts, thereby having important implications for the future
of French policy.
There are significant splits between the two conservative parties on
important areas of policy, notably in foreign affairs, where the Gaullists
are less enthusiastic than the UDF about continuing France's close monetary
links with Germany and much more aggressive about sabotaging last summer's
European community agricultural reforms.
However, the RPR's room for manoeuvre will be restricted by the influence of
President Mitterrand who has the right to veto cabinet appointments and who
will be particularly anxious to establish his own authority, as head of
state, over foreign affairs.
But there is little that the president, or even Mr Chirac, can do to muffle
the rogue voices in the Gaullist camp, notably those of Mr Charles Pasqua
and Mr Philippe Seguin, who led the anti-Maastricht campaign in last
autumn's referendum and have since argued forcefully for the devaluation of
the franc.
Their party's success may make the RPR rogues even more confident about
raising their voices in future.

JOCKEYING FOR POWER IN A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
RPR: Rassemblement pour la Republique. The Gaullist party; more
     nationalist than its UDF partner (see below). Both RPR and UDF
     campaigned in support of privatisation, budget cuts and autonomy
     for the Banque de France. Large majority of RPR leaders favour
     keeping the franc strong. The RPR for which most farmers vote, is
     very hostile to EC and Gatt agriculture reforms.
UDF: Union pour la Democratie Francaise. Federation of five centre-right
     parties. Fought on common platform with RPR. However, UDF more
     free-market and pro-EC and more favourable to decentralisation than
     RPR.
CDS: Centre des Democrates Sociaux. Small party affiliated to UDF.
     French version of Christian Democrats.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Jacques Chirac
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Age 61. Leader of the RPR. Prime Minister twice, once (1974-6) under
  Giscard d'Estaing and once (1986-88) under Mitterand, and does not
  want the job again. Is already effectively running for the presidency
  to succeed Mitterand in 1995, and wants to place government in hands
  of his trusty lieutenant, Edouard Balladur.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Valery Giscard d'Estaing
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Aged 67. Leader of the UDF. As an ex-president (1974-81) does not
  hanker after the prime ministership. But will bargain hard for
  maximum UDF influence in new government. Is more enigmatic than
  Chirac about running for the presidency but will do so if he thinks
  he has a chance. Has a reciprocated dislike of Chirac.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Edouard Balladur
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Aged 63. Former finance minister in the second Chirac government and
  the RPR's frontrunner for prime minister. His political moderation,
  economic orthodoxy and pro-EC stance would make him the most
  acceptable RPR premier to the UDF. Has stated publicly he does not
  want to be president, so allaying fears of potential rivals that he
  might use premiership as a stepping stone.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Alain Juppe
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Aged 47. RPR secretary-general. Very close to Chirac and one of his
  deputies as mayor of Paris. Would now like to get out from Chirac's
  shadow. Has been budget minister (1986-88) and could do another
  economics job. But fancies a higher profile this time as foreign
  minister at the Quai d'Orsay.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles Pasqua
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Aged 65. RPR leader in the Senate. This former drinks salesman
  incarnates populist, hardline Gaullism and was a leader of the
  anti-Maastricht campaign in last year's referendum. Was interior
  minister (1986-88) and would like to be defence minister. Advocates
  creation of a reserve national guard if France moves away from
  conscription to a more professional army.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Edmond Alphandery
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Aged 49. An economics professor turned UDF politician. Keen supporter
  of European monetary union and a strong franc as the best way to get
  there. Turned down Mitterand's offer in December of one of France's
  two European commissionerships, partly to be available for the
  Finance Ministry. But may have too many of his own ideas about
  finance to suit Balladur.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pierre Mehaignerie
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Aged 53. Leader of the small CDS. Has been minister of agriculture
  (1977-81) and would like to be finance minister. Fact that he is
  less well qualified than Alphandery would not be a handicap to
  Balladur, who wants to exert close influence on finance. Big role
  for CDS would help neutralise temptation for centrists to flirt with
  Socialist contenders - like Michel Rocard or Jacques Delors - in the
  1995 presidential race.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Alain Madelin
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Aged 47. Senior UDF leader who negotiated, on his party's behalf,
  common programme with the RPR. But failed to persuade his party or the
  RPR leadership that the franc should be floated as the only way to
  control influence on France of Germany's high interest rates. A
  genuine free-market liberal (a rarity in French politics). Was
  industry minister (1986-88) but now seems resigned to a second-ranking
  ministry, perhaps labour or transport
