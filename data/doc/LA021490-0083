BABCOCK EXPECTED TO LEAVE DENVER, JOIN ATLANTA AS GENERAL MANAGER 
Pete Babcock, the off-again, on-again general manager of the Denver Nuggets, 
will take over as general manager of the Atlanta Hawks in a move expected to be 
completed Wednesday in Atlanta. 
The Times' sources said that Stan Kasten, currently president and general 
manager of both the Hawks and the Atlanta Braves, will remain the president of 
the Hawks but relinquish the Hawks' general manager job to Babcock and 
concentrate on the Braves. 
Babcock, once an assistant coach of the old San Diego Clippers under Paul 
Silas, was the Nuggets' general manager until he was replaced by Dave Checketts 
when a new minority ownership took over the Denver team last summer. But when 
that deal fell through in late summer, Babcock was back in his old job. Soon, 
however, the minority ownership deal went through, with help from TV official 
Bob Wussler, and Babcock was replaced by Jon Spolestra, formerly of the 
Portland Trailblazers. 
Last week, Spoelstra was fired and Babcock was back in once again with the 
Nuggets. But when his powers were reduced considerably in the areas of trades 
and player personnel, he began negotiating with the Hawks. BILL DWYRE
