The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued revisions to three guides in its Regulatory Guide Series. This series
has been developed to describe and make available to the public such information as methods acceptable to the NRC staff
for implementing specific parts of the Commission's regulations, techniques used by the staff in evaluating specific
problems or postulated accidents, and data needed by the staff in its review of applications for permits and licenses.
Revision 30 of Regulatory Guide 1.84, ``Design and Fabrication code Case Acceptability, ASME Section III,'' and
Revision 30 of Regulatory Guide 1.85, ``materials Code Case Acceptability, ASME Section III, Division 1,'' list
those code cases that are generally acceptable to the NRC staff for implementation in the licensing of light-water-cooled
nuclear power plants. Revision 11 of Regulatory Guide 1.147, ``Inservice Inspection code Case Acceptability, ASME
Section XI, Division 1,'' lists those code cases that are generally acceptable to the NRC staff for implementation
in the inserve inspection of light-water-cooled nuclear power plants. These three guides are periodically revised
to update the listings of acceptable code cases and to include the results of public comment and additional staff review.

Comments and suggestions with items for inclusion in guides currently being developed or improvements in all published
guides are encouraged at any time. Written comments may be submitted to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division
of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
