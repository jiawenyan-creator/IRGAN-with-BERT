  [Text] New Zealand's prime minister, Jim Bolger, says he 
expects British warships to resume visits to his country's ports 
after a 10-year break. The visits stopped in 1984 after the 
then Labor Party Government in New Zealand banned nuclear armed 
and nuclear propelled vessels from entering its waters. 
  Speaking in London, Mr. Bolger said the British prime 
minister, John Major, had told him New Zealand's anti-nuclear 
policy had ceased to be an obstacle because British surface 
vessels no longer carry nuclear weapons. Mr. Bolger said it was 
likely a British warship would visit New Zealand this year or 
early next year. He said he hoped the United States would also 
reconsider its policy of not sending naval vessels to New 
Zealand.
