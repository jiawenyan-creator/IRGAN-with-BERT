FT  22 MAR 94 / Porsche to pursue work for other makers
Porsche is to branch out further from its niche as a luxury sports car maker
and expand its business of building cars for other manufacturers, it emerged
yesterday.
'Great efforts' are to be made to build small-volume contract manufacturing
into 'a strategic business sector', according to a rights issue prospectus
published yesterday.
Negotiations are under way to add to Porsche's existing manufacturing
contracts with Mercedes-Benz and Audi, the Volkswagen group's quality car
division.
Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, Porsche chairman, said recently that his new
negotiating partners were 'not necessarily' German.
The contract with the Daimler-Benz subsidiary, under which Porsche makes the
Mercedes 500E series, is due to expire later this year. However, the company
has just started production of the Audi Avant RS2, a high-performance estate
car. This 50:50 joint venture is a brainchild of Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW
group chairman, who also owns an estimated 10 per cent of Porsche.
According to information released ahead of today's opening of the
subscription period for the one-for-four DM200m (Dollars 110m) rights issue,
Porsche expects to build 16,000 of its own cars this year and 2,000 for
third parties. Orders have already been booked for 560 Audi RS2s.
The aim of the rights issue is to help meet estimated development costs of
DM1.5bn for two new sports cars, due to be launched in 1996-97.
Subscriptions for the issue, offering new shares at DM575 for both ordinary
and preference shareholders, must be in by April 7.
It also emerged yesterday that the Porsche and Piech families, which own all
Porsche's voting stock, recently reduced their holdings of preference
shares.
Less well-off members had sold part or all of their non-voting stock to
cover the cost of their entitlement to new ordinary shares, a company
spokesman said. He did not know how many of the preference shares -
previously estimated at 40 per cent of the 875,000 outstanding - remained in
family hands. That was a private matter, he said.
Porsche made a DM114m loss in the six months to January, despite increasing
turnover by almost 20 per cent to DM980m.
Forecasting sales of more than DM2bn and a deficit of DM140m-DM150m for the
full year, after a DM240m loss last time, the company said total deliveries
to customers had increased by 6 per cent to 7,033 cars in the first half.
Deliveries of Porsche marque cars had risen 8 per cent to 6,600.
The company expects to break even in the 1994-95 financial year.
