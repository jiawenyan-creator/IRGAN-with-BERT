FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: Merger provisions keep ABSA
growth to 12%
AMALGAMATED Banks of South Africa (ABSA), the country's largest banking
group, increased earnings per share by 12 per cent to 121 cents in the year
ended March. It was the bank's first year of trading in its current form,
after two large mergers in 1991 and 1992.
The results, which were in line with analysts' expectations, lag those of
ABSA's main competitors. This was blamed on numerous one-off costs
attributable to the January 1992 merger with Bankorp. Foremost among these
were costs related to the retrenchment of 5,000 staff and increased bad debt
provisions.
Mr Piet Badenhorst, chief executive, said given that the group had
experienced a 'crisis year', the earnings performance was satisfactory. The
bank is stepping up its dividend by 10 per cent to 43.5 cents a share.
Net interest income rose to R3.7bn (Dollars 1.16bn) from R2.2bn before the
merger.
Bad and doubtful advances, however, rose by 73 per cent to R781m, reflecting
the legacy of poor lending at Bankorp and ABSA's more conservative
provisioning policy.
Total doubtful debt provisions, including provisions in subsidiaries
acquired, rose to R1.87bn from R637m, or 2.86 per cent of advances.
Mr Badenhorst said ABSA had 'gone to great lengths to provide adequately'
and hence anticipated this figure declining in the year ahead, provided the
state of the economy did not deteriorate.
With other operating income rising to R4.7bn from R2.8bn, and operating
expenditure increasing to R3.6bn from R2.2bn, pre-tax income advanced to
R1.08bn, against R670m. A large jump in the tax bill to R446.1m from R199.8m
left net income, before extraordinary items, 39 per cent higher at R683.8m
(R491.4m).
The smaller increase in earnings per share reflects the 24 per cent rise in
the number of shares in issue following the merger.
