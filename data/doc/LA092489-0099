CLASSICAL PROBLEMS 
In regard to the end of classical music on KFAC: 
National Public Radio station KVCR (91.9 FM) in San Bernardino broadcasts 
classical music daily on weekdays from 1 p.m. until 5 p.m. and weekday evenings 
from 8 p.m. until midnight. (Programming director Steve Ward says that the 
station is adding seven hours of classical music to its weekend schedule and 
that KVCR's signal reaches large areas of Los Angeles and Orange counties.) 
Evening concerts feature the Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony, St. Louis 
Symphony, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and others. Metropolitan Opera 
broadcasts are transmitted during the season on Saturdays. 
A program guide is available from the station.
