FT  08 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Recovery in the balance
Welcome though yesterday's UK manufacturing output figures are, they reveal
little about how consumers will actually react to this month's tax
increases. There are signs the recovery is broadening out into the capital
goods sector: output of investment goods rose 1.8 per cent in the three
months to February. Strip out the fall in car production, which may well
have been erratic, and there appears to have been a healthy increase in
output of consumer goods as well. Insofar as that leads to higher
employment, aggregate personal disposible income will grow, offsetting at
least some of the effect of the tax increases.
In short it looks as though the tax increases are taking effect when other
ingredients of continuing recovery are in place. The unanswered question is
whether a collapse in consumer confidence would choke off investment
spending and therefore hopes of a broader-based recovery as well. At least
this week's buoyant M0 figures for March suggest this has not happened yet.
And there are some grounds for believing the impact of the tax increases may
be less than many feared.
Only some of the increases will actually show up in monthly pay checks. Some
are better described as cuts foregone. Some, like levies on insurance and
travel, have yet to strike and will be absorbed into broader price movements
anyway. Meanwhile, a greater sense of job security and higher turnover in
the housing market may encourage consumers to borrow more. In that case the
balance of payments could displace consumer confidence as the principal
economic worry. That would make it even harder for the government to curry
favour with voters in the local and European elections by cutting interest
rates.
