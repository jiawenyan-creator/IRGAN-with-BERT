JAZZ REVIEW; 
MULLINS MASTERFUL AT BON APPETIT 
Rob Mullins is not yet a household name, but the evidence provided during his 
weekly session at the Bon Appetit left no doubt that the 31-year-old keyboard 
artist is headed for status as an international celebrity. 
Well versed though he is in synthesizer technology (he often plays electric 
keyboards at this Westwood club), Mullins on Sunday confined himself to 
acoustic piano. The confinement, far from pinning him down, offered a chance to 
display his mastery of the jazz tradition in a setting that gave him unlimited 
freedom. 
With Brian Bromberg, a phenomenally fleet young bassist, and Joel Taylor on 
drums, Mullins paid his blues dues with a so-soaked treatment of "Georgia on My 
Mind," complete with funky chording and an occasional foray inside the piano 
for some evocative string-plucking. 
Two tunes from his forthcoming album, "Breakthrough" and the title number "Jazz 
Jazz," attested to Mullins' successful experimentation as a composer. A blues, 
"Five-Four-Three-Two-One," found all three men digging deep into the heart of 
the matter, with Bromberg at his damn-the-torpedoes best. 
Usually heard here every Sunday, Mullins will leave soon for an encore tour of 
Japan, returning to the weekly Bon Appetit gig June 25. LEONARD FEATHER
