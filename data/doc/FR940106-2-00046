<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Trade Commission announces the revised thresholds for interlocking directorates required by the 1990
amendment of section 8 of the Clayton Act. Section 8 prohibits, with certain exceptions, one person from serving as
a director or officer of two competing corporations if two thresholds are met. Competitor corporations are covered
by section 8 if each one has capital, surplus, and undivided profits aggregating more than $10,000,000, with the exception
that no corporation is covered if the competitive sales of either corporation are less than $1,000,000. Section 8(a)(5)
requires the Federal Trade Commission to revise those thresholds annually, based on the change in gross national
product. The new thresholds, which take effect immediately, are $12,092,000 for section 8(a)(1), and $1,209,200
for section 8(a)(2)(A).
