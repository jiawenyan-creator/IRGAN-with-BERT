Bruno Magne's appointment as managing director of France Telecom UK is
further evidence of the ambitions of the French state telecom company's
British ambitions.
In common with several leading continental telecoms operators, France
Telecom last year established a UK subsidiary to exploit the now liberalised
market for data telecoms and private corporate telephone networks, gearing
itself particularly to large companies with substantial European traffic.
France Telecom has more than 100 staff in the UK, and boasts 250 customers
in the corporate telephone network sector alone. Most of its customers are
in the City, and last week it opened a network centre in Docklands.
Magne has been with France Telecom for 27 years, latterly as director of
technical support and quality improvement for its core network. 'My
challenge is to ensure we offer effective local and global business
solutions to our clients in the UK and look for new opportunities,' he says.
Since the UK is Europe's most open telecoms market - and far more open than
the French - he ought not to be short of them.
