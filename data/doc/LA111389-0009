RED ARMY CHORUS 
I was fortunate enough to attend a performance of the Red Army Song &amp; Dance 
Ensemble at the Shrine Auditorium. In spite of the pickets, I enjoyed the 
entire presentation more than anything I have seen in ages. 
Tremendous, to say the least! 
Glasnost not to be excluded, however, I found it incredulous that the program 
began with "The Star-Spangled Banner" and concluded with "God Bless America" 
while slipping in a song in the middle titled "Do the Russians Want War?" 
Attempted partially in English no less. 
Who is trying to tell me what?
