FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Halcion scare still taking toll
at Upjohn
THE HALCION sleeping pill controversy continued to take its toll on Upjohn,
the US pharmaceuticals group, which posted essentially flat second-quarter
earnings.
Upjohn had warned Wall Street that its second-quarter profits would be flat
or below the previous year's performance. Shares in the company added
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 32 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange.
For the three months to June 30, net earnings were Dollars 129.9m, or 72
cents a share, against Dollars 127.5m, or 70 cents, in the same period of
1991. Sales rose 3 per cent to Dollars 883.6m from Dollars 859.4m.
Sales of Halcion dropped 50 per cent in the 1992 second quarter. Halcion was
the world's fastest-selling sleeping pill, and one of Upjohn's main
money-spinners, before concerns about possible side-effects sparked an
international debate.
Net earnings in the 1992 quarter were helped by a lower tax rate. The
company's operating income fell almost 5 per cent, to Dollars 160m from
Dollars 168m, while pre-tax income eased to Dollars 171m from Dollars 175m.
Upjohn said sales of its Rogaine hair-loss treatment also fell in the
quarter, as did sales of its Ansaid non-steroid anti-inflammatory agent. The
declines were offset by higher sales of Upjohn's Xanax anti-anxiety drug and
its Provera progestational drug.
Upjohn is stepping up its efforts to get new products on the market to
offset the impact of several of its important drugs losing their patents in
the next two years.
For the first half, net income was Dollars 273.6m, or Dollars 1.52 a
share,compared with Dollars 260.8m, or Dollars 1.43, a year earlier. Sales
rose 6 per cent to Dollars 1.76bn from Dollars 1.66bn.
