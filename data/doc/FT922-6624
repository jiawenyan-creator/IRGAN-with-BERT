FT  22 MAY 92 / Sales of life assurance up
SALES of life assurance products rose substantially in the first quarter of
this year, the Association of British Insurers said yesterday.
Single-premium business - which often increases during a recession as
consumers look to invest redundancy payments - rose by 85 per cent compared
to the same period last year.
