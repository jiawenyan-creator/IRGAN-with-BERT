FT  19 APR 91 / Urals metal workers in strike to back miners
METAL workers in the Urals industrial city of Sverdlovsk stopped work
yesterday in a two-hour strike to show solidarity with demands of striking
coal miners.
The Sverdlovsk protest, affecting 46 big enterprises in the former power
base of Mr Boris Yeltsin, was the first of a series of solidarity strikes
planned outside the mining sector.
The action came as Russian leaders held talks with miners' representatives
to discuss ways of transferring their centrally-run mines to the
jurisdiction of the Russian Federation.
Mr Yuri Skokov, the deputy Russian prime minister, told parliament after the
talks that this was a key condition for ending the miners' strike in Russia.
The miners have a series of other economic and political demands, including
round-table talks as a prelude to the formation of an all-union coalition
government. Their demands are shared by many of the miners still on strike
in the Ukrainian Donbas.
Mr Skokov said the all-union Coal Ministry, the mines' current master, had
opposed his proposal to turn them over to Russian jurisdiction as joint
stock companies.
The miners see a defection to republican control as an opportunity to market
more of their output independently. The Raspadskaya mine, the largest in the
country, returned to work yesterday after it was switched to Russian
jurisdiction.
In the latest example of the dramatic knock-on effects of the coal strike, a
metal works in the Urals, at Nizhny Tagil, the sole supplier of some
essential inputs for the engineering industry, has been forced to close four
of its six furnaces.
Mr Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister, yesterday met leading radical
economists, including Mr Nikolai Petrakov and Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, to hear
criticism of his anti-crisis programme.
