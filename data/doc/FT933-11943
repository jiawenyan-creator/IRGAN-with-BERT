FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Harmony Leisure links with the Sangster and
Slater families
HARMONY Leisure, the loss-making pubs and restaurants group, yesterday
announced an unexpected link-up with two of the City's best known families -
the Sangsters, former owners of Vernon Pools, and the Slaters, whose Slater
Walker merchant bank collapsed in the 1970s.
Mr Jim Slater, the one time stock market guru and property entrepreneur, has
agreed together with shareholders representing the Sangsters to sell Arion,
their jointly-owned Edinburgh property company, to Harmony.
As part of an all-paper transaction, the two families will receive 12.3m new
Harmony shares at 5p, valuing Arion at Pounds 800,000.
Mr Guy Sangster, whose father Robert was chairman of Vernon Pools until its
acquisition by Thomson T-Line in 1988, is to become a non-executive director
of Harmony once the transaction has been approved by the Stock Exchange.
Mr Christopher Slater, whose father Jim became a share tipster after his
business empire failed, will remain as managing director of Arion.
The move marks Harmony's first sizeable acquisition since the board
announced a Pounds 1.8m rights issue earlier this year to fund the creation
of a property investment division.
Yesterday, Mr John Main, chairman and joint managing director of Harmony,
said the Slaters' interest in fledgling property companies had been aroused
by Mr George Soros's recent investment in British Land, the commercial
property group.
'Harmony is an ideal shell vehicle for them,' Mr Main said. 'We are very
excited about the quality and commitment of the new investors. This
acquisition increases our asset base and brings in a good stream of rental
income.'
The pubs group will also be seeking other all-paper acquisitions to build up
its asset base, he added.
