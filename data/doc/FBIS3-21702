  [Text] As was said a few minutes ago, the leaders of the 
Movement of the Revolutionary Left, the MIR, have placed 
themselves at the disposal of the Chamber of Deputies 
Constitution Committee to be investigated. 
  A FIDES news agency cable refers to a particular case: 
Through a note handed to the Chamber of Deputies president, 
former Interior Minister Guillermo Capobianco, who is a member 
of the MIR, has placed himself at the disposal of the Chamber of 
Deputies Justice Committee. Drug traffickers questioned during 
investigations conducted by the Judicial Police have made the 
serious charge of Capobianco having links with drug traffickers. 
Capobianco today appeared before the Constitution Committee to 
deliver the aforementioned note. On the occasion, he said that 
in the note addressed to Constitution Committee President (Luis 
Sandoval Moron), he ratifies his decision to request that the 
Committee members begin the investigation. Capobianco declined 
to make a statement on his party's behalf. He only said that 
for three years he has been wanting to be heard by a 
constitutional institution.
