SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OCEANSIDE 
Oceanside's growth-control law received another setback Wednesday when the 
state's 4th District Court of Appeal refused to hear the city's plea to 
overturn a lower court ruling against Proposition A. 
Without comment, the three appellate judges let stand Vista Superior Court 
Judge Herbert Hoffman's decision on Aug. 22 that Proposition A fails to 
guarantee that the city will provide its regional fair share of lower-income 
housing. 
The Building Industry Assn. of San Diego, which along with developer Del Oro 
Hills filed suit against the slow-growth law, had hailed Hoffman's decision as 
helping invalidate Proposition A. 
However, the city asked the appellate court on Oct. 20 to set aside Hoffman's 
ruling, claiming he had incorrectly interpreted the law in reaching his 
decision. 
But the appeals court's unwillingness to hear the matter means the litigants 
return to Superior Court on Feb. 11 to begin a new trial on another aspect of 
Proposition A. 
While the first trial before Hoffman focused on whether Proposition A made 
enough housing available, the next phase will concern whether the 
growth-control law is necessary under state law to protect the health and 
safety of the city.
