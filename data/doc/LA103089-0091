ON THE SIDELINES; 
JIMMY CARSON MAY BE TRADED AGAIN -- THIS TIME TO RED WINGS 
Edmonton's Jimmy Carson -- the Los Angeles Kings player who was traded, along 
with $15 million -- for Wayne Gretzky, may be dealt again, this time to the 
Detroit Red Wings, a newspaper reported today. 
The clubs are close to a trade that would send Carson and another Oilers player 
to Detroit in exchange for Petr Klima, Joe Murphy and Adam Graves, the Detroit 
Free Press reported in today's editions. 
The newspaper said it learned of the deal from two sources it did not name, one 
with the Red Wings and one close to Carson, 21, whose family lives in a Detroit 
suburb. 
The Red Wings had no comment on the report, spokesman Bill Jamieson said this 
morning. 
"Whatever happens, happens," said Carson, who walked out on the Oilers two 
weeks ago after demanding to be traded. He had a goal and two assists in four 
games this season with Edmonton and had 49 goals and 51 assists last season, 
his first with the Oilers after a trade that sent Gretzky, the NHL's all-time 
scoring leader, to the Kings. 
Klima said he will refuse to report to Edmonton if traded there.
