  [Text] A strange attack was staged against a U.S. citizen's 
car in eastern Santiago this morning. The attack occurred 
shortly before 0900 [1200 GMT] on Manuel Canas Street in 
Vitacura, where U.S. citizen (David Soto Barcelo) has his 
residence. 
  Soto had parked his car in front of his house. Two unknown 
persons threw a bomb under the car and escape on foot. Minutes 
later, the bomb went off, damaging the vehicle. 
  Carabineros GOPE [Special Police Operations Group] personnel 
went to the scene and discovered that the bomb was a 
fragmentation grenade. 
  David Soto, who declined to comment on the incident, is 
renting a building in Vitacura. The building is being remodeled 
for housing the LA Rock nightclub. 
  One of the possibilities police are considering is that the 
attack might have something to do with intimidation because of 
Soto's commercial activities.
