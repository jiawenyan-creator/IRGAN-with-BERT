FT  22 JUN 92 / MGN Pounds 300m loss expected
THE long-awaited accounts of Mirror Group Newspapers, to be published
tomorrow, will show losses of more than Pounds 300m after full provisions
have been made.
The newspaper group's gross losses are expected to total about Pounds 400m.
The losses include the money that disappeared in the last months of Robert
Maxwell's life and Pounds 150m in lost pension-fund money.
The trading profits of the group, which includes the Daily Mirror, Sunday
Mirror, The People, Daily Record and Sunday Mail, are expected to be about
Pounds 80m.
No one was prepared to bid for MGN until its true financial position was
known.  Directors expect to announce the completion of a two-year financing
package for MGN - Pounds 180m in lease finance and Pounds 250m in loan
facilities. The relisting of MGN shares, suspended in December, is not
expected for at least a further two weeks.
Completion of medium-term financing clears the way for the sale of the
majority stake under the control of Arthur Andersen, the administrators, and
which is in effect owned by a group of banks. An early sale seems unlikely,
although as many as nine groups have expressed an interest.
Mr John Talbot, the Arthur Andersen administrator, will say only that he has
no plans to sell the majority stake. It might be next year before the
company is sold. Earlier this month the government set up a Department of
Trade and Industry inquiry into events at MGN and in particular last year's
flotation.
Apart from disclosing MGN's present financial position, the document will
also set out in detail how 'irregular transactions' involving the company
came to be made. That account is expected to throw more light on the
resignations last week of Mr Ernest Burrington as chairman of MGN and Mr
Lawrence Guest as finance director.
