FT  20 AUG 93 / Observer: Smoke-free
The recent correspondence on smoking has reminded a colleague of a North Sea
ferry crossing he made a few years ago. The cabin, which was shared by six
strangers, displayed a sign explaining that smoking was allowed 'by
consensus'.
In the middle of the night five sleepers were awoken by the sixth occupant,
a burly soldier going home on leave, who asked if it was all right for him
to smoke. Yes, it was agreed after some eye-rubbing, he could smoke. 'Oh
good,' he said, 'anyone got a cig?'
