FT  06 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: No homecoming party for Ireland
There will be no great home-coming for Ireland's World Cup team. Four years
ago, more than 300,000 people packed Dublin's streets to welcome the team
when they returned from the World Cup in Italy after reaching the
quarter-finals.
But plans for a similar open-air party were canceled yesterday in the wake
of Ireland's 2-0 loss to Holland. Up to 500,000 fans had been expected at
Phoenix Park to greet the team tomorrow, but organisers cancelled the
reception when they learned that manager Jack Charlton and half the players
would not be returning this week.
Charlton is staying in the US to work as a television commentator, while up
to a dozen players are taking holidays.
The Irish broadcasting service RTE was swamped with calls from fans critical
of Charlton's decision to ignore the homecoming.
