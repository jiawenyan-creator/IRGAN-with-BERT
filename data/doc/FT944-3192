FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: Taiwanese groups face setback
over eurobond issuance
Hopes that Taiwanese companies could raise fresh equity through the launch
of convertible eurobonds look set to be dashed as the first of a rush of
issues since 1989 comes up for repayment later this month.
The authorities in Taipei have yet to reach agreement on rules allowing
foreigners to convert their holdings into listed shares, although the matter
has been the subject of debate since Yuen Foong Yu Paper (YFY), a listed
paper manufacturer, issued Taiwan's first convertible bond in 1989.
YFY may thus have to redeem its Dollars 120m issue in cash when a put option
falls due on December 21.
To date, 29 Taiwanese companies have issued euroconvertible bonds, mostly in
the past year. But because foreign individuals are not permitted to buy
Taiwan shares directly, government departments have been unable to solve the
dilemma presented by conversion.
The central bank and the finance ministry, to which the Securities and
Exchange Commission reports, have agreed in principle that convertible bonds
may be switched into global depository receipts. However, the details of
such a conversion method have yet to be worked out.
Investor appetite for Taiwanese paper has largely evaporated due to
oversupply following a flurry of issues this year. Secondary trading has
dried up and proposed new issues are being met coolly amid rising interest
rates and concern over the lack of convertibility.
In YFY's case, the point is moot as the current share price makes conversion
unattractive. But several other issues have met criteria for conversion set
out in issue documents.
A number of Taiwanese companies have delayed or cancelled planned
convertible issues as the cost has risen almost to the level of raising
funds domestically. In October Formosa Plastics Corp, the petrochemical
company, shelved plans to raise USDollars 300m in convertible bonds.
