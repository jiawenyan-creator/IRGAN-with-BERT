DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
COUNCIL ASKED TO MEET IN SUNLAND-TUJUNGA 
The Los Angeles City Council may go on the road again -- this time to 
Sunland-Tujunga for the first time. 
Councilman Joel Wachs on Friday asked his colleagues to hold their March 1 
meeting at the Sunland-Tujunga Municipal Building in his district. The council 
has met outside of City Hall twice: five years ago in Canoga Park and last year 
in San Pedro. 
His request is expected to be voted on next week.
