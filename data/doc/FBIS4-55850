  [Text] Belgrade, May 20 (TANJUG) -- After nearly two years 
of international sanctions against the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, about one million children in the Yugoslav Republics 
of Serbia and Montenegro live below the subsistence level. 
According to reports of the Yugoslav Commission for Cooperation 
With the U.N. International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), 
another 200,000 children who have fled from the war-torn former 
Yugoslav republics are on the brink of starvation. 
  "Due to the dramatic fall of the personal and overall social 
standard of living, morbidity and death rates have almost 
quadrupled in only two years", Ljiljana Stojanovic, assistent 
federal health minister told TANJUG. Only 80 percent of the 
children in the F.R.Y. last year received obligatory vaccines. 
According to the Ministry's information, the worsening of the 
conditions in the health system is evident: 1.45 in every one 
hundred hospitalized children died in 1989 and as many as 2.07 
in 1993. 
  The University Children's Clinic, the largest in the F.R.Y., 
gets almost all supplies from the humanitarian aid provided by 
organizations and individuals, the Belgrade daily VECERNJE 
NOVOSTI writes on Friday. 
  "The aid comes neither timely nor in sufficient quantities. 
At the surgery department the number of check-ups and 
operations has been reduced by 92 percent, while the number of 
postoperative infections has increased by 30 percent", director 
of the clinic, Dr Dusan Scepanovic said. At the clinic's 
pediatrics and surgery departments, 141 children died last year, 
which is an increase of as much as [word indistinct] percent to 
the 1991 figure. 
  As in previous years, five percent of the social product is 
being earmarked for the health service. In 1989, it amounted to 
two billion U.S. dollars on the territory of Serbia and 
Montenegro but last year it was merely around 300 million 
dollars.
