FT  25 APR 91 / World Trade News: Charles warns Brazilians
BRITAIN'S Prince Charles yesterday urged Brazilian business to act over
deprived communities, and warned against the social costs of progress.
The prince told business leaders in Sao Paulo, on the third day of a six-day
visit to Brazil: 'Action to address community problems cannot be successful
without full business involvement.
'I cannot help feeling our societies and economies are set on a course in
the name of progress which has already brought us close to ecological
disaster and social disharmony, and now requires urgent remedial action.'
While sympathising with Brazil's problems, Prince Charles urged its business
community to act now or face appalling social consequences of increased
violence and illiteracy. The prince and his wife, Princess Diana, are in
Brazil at the invitation of President Fernando Collor.
'If we do not implement sensible policies, such as better access and a
fairer price for exports from the developing South, we cannot expect
countries such as Brazil to adopt costly measures which . . . risk
compounding existing economic difficulties,' the prince added.
