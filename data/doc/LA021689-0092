OIL THAT MAY HAVE PERFUMED KINGS IS FOUND 
Near the site where the Dead Sea scrolls were found, archeologists have dug up 
a 2,000-year-old clay flask filled with an oil that might have been used to 
anoint the ancient Israelite kings. 
Joseph Patrich of Hebrew University unveiled the flask Wednesday and said the 
honey-like oil may be the only surviving sample of a balsam oil used as an 
aromatic body cream or perfume and famous throughout the Roman Empire. 
The oil matches a description of an expensive perfume mentioned by the Roman 
historian Pliny. Known as persimmon oil, it was distilled from a bush-like 
plant now believed to be extinct. 
The 5-inch-tall flask contains about 1 1/2 to 3 1/2 ounces of the 
well-preserved reddish oil, which dates to the 1st Century BC. It was wrapped 
in palm leaves and carefully concealed. 
The persimmon plant, which was different from the modern tree of the same name, 
grew only in the Dead Sea oasis of En Gedi and around Jericho. The ancient 
Israelites guarded the secret formula for making the oil and tried to destroy 
the orchards when Roman legions approached. Pliny's writings indicate the 
Romans took over production, archeologists say. 
The flask, buried in a 3-foot-deep pit in the caves at Qumran, 50 miles 
southeast of Jerusalem, was found last year by an archeology team that includes 
an American group of volunteers from the Institute of Judaic-Christian Research 
in Arlington, Tex. 
Hebrew University chemist Zeev Aizenshtat said whatever fragrance the oil once 
had had evaporated in the desert cave, where summer temperatures hover over 104 
degrees.
