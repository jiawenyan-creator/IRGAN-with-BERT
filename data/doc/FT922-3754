FT  10 JUN 92 / Danes to prepare White Paper
THE DANISH government is to prepare a White Paper on Denmark's future
relationship with the EC, following rejection of the Maastricht Treaty in
the June 2 referendum, writes Hilary Barnes from Copenhagen. This emerged
yesterday after a meeting of leaders of all eight parties represented in the
Folketing (parliament) to discuss the situation after the 'No' vote.
