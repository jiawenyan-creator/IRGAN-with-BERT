<F P=106> [Interview with Carlos Alberto Montaner, chairman of Cuban </F>
opposition organization, by Martin Ehl in Madrid; date not 
given: "Castro's Obstinacy Is an Obstacle"] 
  [Text] "The Cuban opposition, both abroad and at home, is 
very fragmented. The first step in Cuba's transition from a 
totalitarian regime will be the unification of all opposition 
forces," Carlos Alberto Montaner, chairman of the Cuban Liberal 
Union in Exile and head of the influential dissident 
organization Democratic Platform, told a group of Czech 
reporters in an interview. Montaner has been living in exile 
since the age of 18, and currently works as a journalist and 
translator in Spain. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Could you briefly describe the situation of 
the Cuban opposition? 
  [Montaner] We expect fundamental changes in Cuba. The 
regime is trying to survive at the cost of constantly 
intensifying repressions. The opposition is attempting to find 
a peaceful solution that would lead to talks and free elections. 
The authorities continue, however, to persecute the dissidents. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Could you say what is the stand of the 
Democratic Platform regarding the person of Jorge Mas Canosa 
(leader of a strong right-wing exile organization in the United 
States -- LIDOVE NOVINY note)? 
  [Montaner] Mas Canosa represents a group that does not 
believe in a peaceful solution to the situation in Cuba, and 
expects that the change will be accompanied by acts of violence 
against the regime. That certainly is very dangerous because it 
could lead to a civil war that would completely devastate the 
country. 
  The main difference between us is that we endeavor to talk 
with Castro's government and seek a political solution. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Do you get any help from the international 
community? 
  [Montaner] Yes. There is a group of Christian democrats and 
a group of social democrats in our Liberal Union. They both 
maintain contacts with the international centers of their 
respective movements. 
  We have encountered great understanding and help in the 
postcommunist countries, also in the Czech Republic, which, as a 
former communist state, knows what it means to have a communist 
government. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] What are the main obstacles in Cuba's 
transition to democracy? 
  [Montaner] First of all, it is Castro's obstinacy. He 
created a dictatorship and is now attempting to change it into a 
Chinese-type regime, wherein the capitalist economy is 
controlled by the communists. For a number of reasons, however, 
what works in China has no chance of success in Cuba. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] Do you really believe that the fundamental 
changes that await Cuba can be implemented by peaceful means? 
  [Montaner] Before 1989, we believed that a peaceful 
transition was impossible. The changes in Central Europe, which 
transpired without bloodshed, gave us hope that the Cuban 
transformation could take a similar course. The only possible 
way is a dialogue with the opposition. If it was possible in 
your country, Poland, and Hungary, why not in Cuba? 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] If a violent coup took place after all, 
would the United States intervene? 
  [Montaner] I am convinced it would. If a civil war took 
place, the United States would be interested in an intervention. 
It certainly would result in an international conflict. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] What will be the priorities of the first 
Cuban postcommunist government and how much time is needed to 
reform the country? 
  [Montaner] The first democratic government should orientate 
itself toward the market and democracy. As far as the reforms 
are concerned, it will depend on political consensus. If the 
fundamental political agreements are reached, within four to 
five years the new Cuban Government can overcome the worst 
difficulties. The situation in the country is so bad that 
whatever happens, it will be an improvement. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] How can one explain that Castro remains in 
power despite the current catastrophic situation? 
  [Montaner] In Cuba, we are talking about a combination of 
the communist regime and a standard Latin American Caudillism, a 
dictatorship. The Latin American dictatorships usually endure 
for a long time, just look at Paraguay, for instance. 
  [LIDOVE NOVINY] A year ago, you said in an interview that a 
change will take place in Cuba within a year. The truth is 
different. So, when will the change take place? 
  [Montaner] At this time, I cannot say. It is difficult for 
a politician to predict. Perhaps, we could consult an 
astrologist. 
  The estimates differ, it could take three or four years.
