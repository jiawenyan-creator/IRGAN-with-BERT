FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Tough US trading leaves JIB at Pounds 18.2m
TOUGH trading conditions in the United States insurance market and
international reinsurance markets depressed pre-tax profits at JIB Group,
the insurance broker, to Pounds 18.2m in 1992, compared with Pounds 20.1m.
Lower interest rates also affected the result to leave earnings per share
down 26 per cent, from 13.6p to 10.1p.
A final dividend of 5p is proposed, making a total for the year of 7.5p.
Last year there was a single final of 5p.
'In difficult markets and difficult times we have not done too badly,' said
Mr Nick Cosh, finance director of the company, which is a subsidiary of
Jardine Matheson Holdings.
Turnover increased to Pounds 175.9m (Pounds 168.9m). There was a lower
contribution from the US of Pounds 79.5m (Pounds 80.6m), offset by increases
in the UK and Ireland to Pounds 71.7m (Pounds 66.8m) and Asia Pacific to
Pounds 24.8m (Pounds 21.5m).
Administrative expenses rose to Pounds 176.3m (Pounds 165.2m), partly
because of a number of one-off costs.
The closure of the Philadelphia and New York offices cost Pounds 1.5m.
Although the dollar strengthened towards the end of the year, foreign
exchange losses earlier in 1992 cost another Pounds 1m.
Income from associated undertakings rose to Pounds 2.26m (Pounds 416,000),
and interest payable fell to Pounds 3m (Pounds 4.5m).
