  [Text] Brussels, Dec 30 (AFP) -- Belgium will establish 
diplomatic relations with the Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia (FYROM) soon, Foreign Minister Willy Claes announced 
Thursday [30 December]. 
  France, Germany, the Netherlands, Britain, Italy and Denmark 
announced in mid-December that they would set up diplomatic ties 
with Macedonia. 
  Claes told a news conference here, "Belgium will follow this 
example as soon as its presidency of the European Union ends." 
  Greece will succeed Belgium as six-month president of the 
12-nation European Community on January 1, to be followed by 
Germany on July 1. 
  Athens has criticized its EC partners for establishing 
diplomatic relations with its northern neighbor which it insists 
must change its name before it should be recognized. 
  Greece has a northern region also named Macedonia and says 
it 
fears the former Yugoslav republic may have territorial claims 
on the region.
