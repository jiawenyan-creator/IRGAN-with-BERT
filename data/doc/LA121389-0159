WORLD; 
MUSLIM SEPARATISTS RELEASE DAUGHTER OF INDIA HOME MINISTER 
Muslim separatists today freed the daughter of a Cabinet minister after the 
government released five jailed comrades, officials said. 
Rubaiya Sayeed, the daughter of Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, was taken 
to a friend's home in this northern city two hours after the militants were 
freed downtown, police said. 
Young Muslim men celebrated the militants' release by shooting off firecrackers 
in Srinagar, the summer capital of India's northernmost state of Jammu-Kashmir, 
which borders Pakistan. About 3,000 people shouted anti-India slogans and waved 
the national flag of Pakistan, which has fought three wars with India over 
Kashmir. 
Sayeed, 22, was abducted at gunpoint Dec. 8 as she was going home from her job 
at a hospital in Srinagar.
