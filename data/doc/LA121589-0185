BUSH 'REALLY' LIT YULE TREE, AIDE SAYS, FUDGING ON REAGAN 
President Bush pressed "the real thing" when he switched on the National 
Christmas Tree, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today, but he hesitated when 
asked the same question about former President Reagan. 
"I better let that go," Fitzwater said when asked if Reagan had used a phony 
button in the years that he lit the tree from the safety of a White House 
balcony, several hundred yards from the tree. 
"Is your non-answer an answer?" he was asked. 
"Well, sort of," responded Fitzwater, who served as press spokesman to Reagan 
before taking on the same assignment with Bush. 
Asked about this year's ceremony, Fitzwater asserted without hesitation: "Last 
night was the real thing." 
Bush lit the 35-foot national tree Thursday night in person at a public outdoor 
ceremony on the Ellipse. During his eight years in office, Reagan stayed within 
the White House complex for the ceremony, supposedly lighting the Christmas 
tree by remote control.
