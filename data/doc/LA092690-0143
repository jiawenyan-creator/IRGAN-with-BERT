LAGUNA MUSEUM COMPLETES FISCAL YEAR WITH SURPLUS 
For the first time since it completed a major renovation in 1986, the Laguna 
Art Museum has ended its fiscal year in the black, according to preliminary 
figures released Tuesday by museum director Charles Desmarais. 
"We're $91,453 on the plus side" for the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, Desmarais 
said. 
Last August, the organization ended the year with a $72,000 deficit. The 
museum's 1990 budget is $1.3 million. 
Desmarais said the museum held 1990 spending at roughly the same level as last 
year and attributed the financial turnaround to increased charitable 
contributions and grant support. 
"I think it's a result of increased excitement about the museum and where it's 
going," he said, pointing to two traveling exhibits organized by the museum -- 
one of work by media artist Ilene Segalove, another showcasing California 
Impressionism -- and to three scholarly catalogues the museum published. 
"We're not entirely where I'd like us to be (financially) for the long term," 
said Desmarais.
