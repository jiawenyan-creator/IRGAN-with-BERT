FT  24 FEB 92 / Construction Contracts: French heritage project
GILLESPIES, the architectural firm based in Glasgow, has won a contract for
the design and implementation of the Pounds 3.5m first phase of a large
themed heritage development in the historic Breton port of Douarnenez, near
Brest.
The firm was awarded the contract in a competition organised by the local
authority, the Ville de Douarnenez. The proposals were drawn up in
co-operation with Mr Jim Philpott, who works for the French architectural
practice of Valode et Pistre.
The first phase includes the conversion of a disused warehouse complex to
allow the expansion of the existing maritime museum and the refurbishment of
a square in front of the museum, creating a site on which a wooden sailing
ship is to be constructed.
Gillespies will also be creating a turn of the century street scene in a
complex of buildings and vacant sites next to the museum.
This will be done through refurbishment of buildings, resurfacing squares
and alleyways, and building houses and workshops on derelict sites.
