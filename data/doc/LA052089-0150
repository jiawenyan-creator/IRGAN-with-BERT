SILVERCREST SELLS ITS MOBILE HOME BUILDING BUSINESS 
Silvercrest Industries in Santa Ana said Friday that it has sold its mobile 
home manufacturing business to a Dallas firm, reducing Silvercrest to a 
fraction of its former size. 
Silvercrest, which garnered most of its revenue from mobile home manufacturing, 
also reported a $2.2-million loss for its fiscal third quarter, ended March 31. 
The company said a costly lawsuit over a 385-acre mobile home park in the San 
Fernando Valley and its continuing troubles in developing and selling 800 
mobile homes at the park -- Santiago Estates -- caused most of the losses last 
year. 
The company said it recently settled that court fight by agreeing to pay Los 
Angeles housing giant Kaufman &amp; Broad $2.75 million. 
Silvercrest sold the mobile home business -- which includes what the company 
says is the biggest mobile home factory west of the Mississippi, in Corona -- 
for $175,000 in cash, a note for $275,000 and assumption of $15.9 million in 
debt. 
The purchaser is Western Homes Corp., a subsidiary of Dallas-based Redman 
Industries Inc., a big mobile home manufacturer. The sale had been expected. 
Silvercrest's quarterly loss was more than double the $807,000 loss it had in 
last year's fiscal third quarter. Its quarterly revenue fell slightly to $14 
million this year from $14.4 million last year. 
For the first 9 months, Silvercrest posted a loss of $2.1 million. Its revenue 
grew 13% to $48 million for the period from $42.4 million for the same period 
last year.
