FT  20 OCT 94 / Two Tory MPs to quit Commons
Mr Tim Renton, Baroness Thatcher's last chief whip, and Sir Wyn Roberts,
former Welsh Office minister, are to retire from parliament at the next
general election.
Mr Renton, 62, has been Conservative MP for Sussex Mid for 22 years. He said
yesterday that it was time for the constituency to be represented by a
younger person.
A strong pro-European, Mr Renton said that he would spend the remainder of
his time in the Commons fighting to ensure 'that the clear water between us
and the Labour party is not muddied by stupid calls for Britain to leave the
European Union'.
Sir Wyn Roberts, Tory MP for Conwy since 1970, told his constituency
association in a letter last night that in June he would celebrate 25 years
as the constituency's representative. 'I shall then be within a month of my
65th birthday.'
Mr Renton has a majority of 20,528 and Mr Roberts of 995.
