FT  19 SEP 94 / Spain gives way to UK ferry line
Spain has conceded defeat in a two-year battle to prevent a British ferry
line operating services between Spain and Nador in Morocco, writes Charles
Batchelor.
The British company, Cenargo, said it had been granted permission to operate
a service from Almeria in Spain under the name Ferrimaroc from mid-November.
Eighteen months ago Spanish gunboats prevented a Cenargo ferry, the
Scirocco, from berthing at the port.
Cenargo took its fight to the Spanish courts and also obtained a ruling from
the European Commission that it had the right, under the single-market
regulations, to operate the service.
