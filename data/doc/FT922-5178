FT  02 JUN 92 / Letter: Rationale for European Central Bank in London
Sir, The siting of the proposed European Central Bank is already becoming a
subject of profound and widespread debate across Europe and is one which
will intensify over the coming months. One central issue, agreed upon
unanimously, is that the ECB must be immune from political interference in
order to be truly effective.
With this in mind, it should be made clear that although the ECB should be
politically independent, it cannot be independent of the financial markets
themselves. As such, to locate the ECB anywhere other than in the
best-equipped financial centre would, by definition, be a triumph of
politics over commercial commonsense and would defeat the very basis of this
principle.
In terms of the derivatives markets, London and Liffe must be considered to
be in an unassailable position to accommodate the prospective activities of
the ECB and is clearly able to demonstrate its advantages over its
contemporaries. As initially, the ECB will only be active in interest and
foreign exchange rate management, the primary derivative instruments
underlying this activity will be short-term Ecu interest rate futures and
options.
Given that Liffe is the only exchange upon which this contract is listed at
present and that Liffe also lists similar contracts on several other
European short-term interest rates, its aggregate volume is vastly superior
to any other European derivatives exchange.
The DTB in Germany has no short-term interest rate derivatives listed,
whereas the Matif in Paris, which is the second largest exchange in Europe
in this respect, traded in 1991 the equivalent of just 25 per cent of the
total turnover of the European interest rate contracts recorded on Liffe.
This being true, the home of the ECB, so far as the derivatives markets are
concerned, can surely only be based in London.
