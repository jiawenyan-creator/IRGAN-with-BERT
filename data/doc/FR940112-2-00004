A voluntary moratorium has been in effect on the removal of dolphins from the Gulf of Mexico since February 1990. During
that time, NMFS has extended the public display permits of permit holders, who had previously been authorized to capture
Atlantic bottlenose dolphins, but deferred collecting the animals as a result of the moratorium. The permit holders
listed above have requested that their permits authorizing the collection of dolphins be extended through 1994.
NMFS has granted their requests. However, in light of questions about the status and health of wild populations of
Atlantic bottlenose dolphins and the availability of dolphins from sources other than the wild, NMFS is continuing
to ask collectors to participate in a voluntary moratorium on dolphin collection. NMFS will consider requests to
collect only if there is reasonable indication that dolphins from the wild are necessary to maintain a public display
collection.
