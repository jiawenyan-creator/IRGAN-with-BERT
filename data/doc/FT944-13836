FT  26 OCT 94 / Pension claimants face complicated procedure
The process set out yesterday by the Securities and Investments Board, the
City's chief regulator, for compensating people who bought personal pensions
on poor advice is as complex as the transactions it deals with.
It involves detailed procedures and complicated calculations. This is how it
should work.
Deciding which opt-out cases should be reviewed, and when.
SIB has identified priorities among the estimated 800,000 people who have
opted out or not joined an employers' scheme, and has set dates by which
most of the 250,000 cases in these categories should have been reviewed.
The priorities are:
Retired or dead investors, and people who were 35 or more when they opted
out and are still with the same employer. Target date: end-1995.
People who opted out when they were under 35, are still in the same job and
making personal pension contributions. People who did not join an employer's
scheme and were 35 or more when they bought a personal pension, and are
still in the same job and making personal pension contributions. Target
date: mid-1996.
People who opted out when they were 35 or more and are no longer with the
same employer. Target date: end-1996.
Deciding which pension transfer cases should be reviewed.
SIB says that because there are circumstances in which transferring a lump
sum from a pension scheme will not have caused harm to the investor, only
about 100,000 of these 600,000 investors automatically need to be contacted.
The priorities are:
Retired or dead investors, and men 55-plus and women 50-plus at the time of
the transaction. Target date: end-1995.
Men aged 50 to 54 and women aged 45 to 49 at the time of the transaction.
Target date: end-1996.
Any non-priority investor can also ask their life company or adviser to
review their case within two years.
Identifying cases where people took out personal pensions and opted out or
did not join their employers' schemes.
With some understatement, SIB calls this a 'major administrative task'.
Each life insurance company or independent adviser should send a simple
questionnaire, devised by SIB, to every employed person to whom it sold a
personal pension. If a company has gone out of business then the pensions
unit set up by the Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog to protect
the private investor, will take on the task.
Getting the information on both opt-outs and transfers.
SIB says companies and advisers must get the facts, even where records have
not been kept. This will often mean they should get in touch directly with
the investor and with the occupational pension schemes.
Small firms of independent advisers can ask the PIA pensions unit to carry
out its administration, in return for a fee.
Deciding whether the investor should get compensation.
SIB says that without using hindsight the question here is whether the sales
agent or adviser failed to meet regulators' requirements in a way which
affected the investor's decision, causing actual or potential loss. An
example might be whether the customer did not have enough information to
make an informed decision.
Providing compensation.
SIB urges occupational schemes to take back people who have opted out, and
to allow readmission of those who decided on poor advice not to join.
Several schemes sound sympathetic. Where they are not, the life company or
adviser would top up the personal pension so that, at retirement, the
benefits that the occupational scheme would have offered can be replicated.
In transfers, where occupational schemes are much less likely to allow
investors back in, a top-up would also be SIB's preferred method of
compensation.
Only where someone has already retired would compensation be an immediate
cash sum.
Those companies that sold the personal pensions will have to pay for
compensating their own customers where necessary. If - in the case of small
independent advisers - this proves beyond them, or they have already gone
out of business, the bill will be paid from the Investors' Compensation
Scheme, up to a maximum of Pounds 48,000 in any one case. The ICS is funded
by the financial services industry.
Deciding whether compensation is fair.
The regulators are issuing guidelines about how the compensation should be
calculated. In offering compensation to investors a life company or adviser
will have to say whether its offer was calculated on that basis and, if not,
why not.
They will also have to remind investors that they should consider their
position very carefully if they are in any doubt, and tell them about the
company complaints procedure.
In practice, where disputes arise and customers do not want to go to court,
they will have access to the PIA ombudsman scheme.
Monitoring the process.
Life companies and advisers will have their case reviews checked by their
regulators - primarily the PIA. They could be disciplined if they are
misleading or incompetent.
The SIB leaflet for investors is available from libraries and Citizens
Advice Bureaux or by sending a large stamped, addressed envelope to:
Pensions Factsheet, PO Box 701, Basildon, Essex SS14 3FD. The PIA pensions
unit can be contacted on 071 417 7001, fax 071 417 8100.
