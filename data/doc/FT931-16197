FT  08 JAN 93 / 2.75% deal opens pay round
IN THE first deal of the 1993 pay round a 2.75 per cent pay rise has been
agreed for most of the 20,000 workers in the knitwear industry.
The government will be relieved that the first agreement in a busy month for
collective bargaining is not far off its limit for the public sector of 1.5
per cent, and below the current 3 per cent inflation rate.
However, the knitwear industry is particularly weak and several other
sectors' deals, agreed before January but only now coming into effect, have
been more generous. They include 5.9 per cent in the thermal insulation
industry, 5 per cent at Highland Fabricators, 4 per cent at Nissan and 3.95
per cent plus a lump sum at National Power.
Next Wednesday the leaders of 160,000 white-collar workers in the NHS will
challenge the 1.5 per cent limit with a claim for a 'substantial' rise.
Harrow council in London, which has opted out of central bargaining, faces a
4.5 per cent pay claim from public service unions Nalgo and Nupe, which are
testing the council's commitment to local discretion.
Meanwhile several other councils are likely to follow Barrow-in-Furness's
planned pay freeze for its 400 salaried staff from April.
The Timex plant in Dundee was yesterday occupied by its 400 workers in
protest against a move to lay off 200 of them.
