  [Text] Bileca (TANJUG) -- In his Christmas and New Year's 
message, Major General Ratko Mladic, chief of staff of the army 
of the republic of Srpska, stated that the Srpska army and its 
personnel had achieved significant results defending the Serbian 
population and territories in this war which was imposed on them 
and threatened their well being and freedom. However, despite 
all the efforts made by the Serbian side to establish peace, the 
end of this war is not yet in sight.
