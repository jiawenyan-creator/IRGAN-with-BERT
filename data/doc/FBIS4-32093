  [Text] Julian Garcia Vargas and Piotr Kolodziejczyk, 
defense ministers of the Kingdom of Spain and of Poland, signed 
a defense cooperation agreement today. 
  [Begin Vargas recording, in Spanish with passage-by-passage 
translation into Polish] We discussed all issues concerning 
military cooperation, and I think we can become partners in the 
European Union soon. [end recording] 
  [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] This agreement sanctions the 
reality that has been a fact for some years now. Our close 
cooperation links have been in existence since 1990, with 
varying degrees of intensity. This agreement, unlike other 
standard bilateral agreements, does not contain any secret 
clauses. It simply constitutes a legal basis for making our 
cooperation more dynamic. 
  When it comes to our plenary talks, I would like to 
emphasize 
with great satisfaction that Minister Vargas said in a very 
clear and decisive way not only on his own behalf but also on 
behalf of the Spanish Government that Spain will forcefully 
support our aspirations toward integration into the West 
European structures, the economic and defense structures. [end 
recording]
