FT  18 FEB 92 / Observer: Too divine
Britain's two-man bobsleigh team, despite achieving the best British
performance since 1964 and squandering their gold medal chances in La Plagne
at the weekend, were offered some heavenly consolation as they skidded over
the finish line in sixth place.
A spectator, convinced that all sportsmen are equal in the eyes of God,
waved an encouraging banner at the luckless pair. It read simply 'John
3:16'. The verse includes valuable advice for those indulging in the
high-speed Olympic event. It says: 'Whosoever believeth in Him shall not
perish but have eternal life.'
