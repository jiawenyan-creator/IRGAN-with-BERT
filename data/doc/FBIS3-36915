  [Text] Limits on the amount of TV broadcasting imposed in 
over 30 areas of Russia on Thursday will be in force till the 
debts to communications facilities, which have reached about 80 
Bn rubles, are paid up. 
  Interfax learned this on Thursday from Anatoliy Nazeikin, 
the 
chairman of the Communications Workers' Trade Union. Nazeikin 
qualified Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's resolution on "paying 
these debts gradually" as "vague and indefinite". He described 
Wednesday's conference, urgently held by the premier with the 
Communications Minister, Vladimir Bulgak, and with the leader of 
the state-sponsored Ostankino television company, Aleksandr 
Yakovlev, as "intergovernmental talks". 
  Limits on the volume of telecasts were imposed with a view 
to 
saving electricity, the leader of the Communications Workers' 
Union pointed out. According to Nazeikin, this action will be 
ceased only after negotiations between government officials, the 
coordinating council of communications facilities' staffs and 
the central committee of their union, to be held to fix concrete 
dates for paying the debts and the sums allocated for these 
needs. 
  Earlier the chief of the radio communications, broadcasting 
and television department of Russia's Communications Ministry, 
Stanislav Glubokov, told Interfax that at noon on Thursday over 
30 cities in Russia reduced the amount of telecasts on the two 
state-sponsored channels to news programs alone. Cuts in the 
telecasts were imposed in St. Petersburg and its region, in 
Rostov, Volgograd, Krasnoyarsk. 
  In Moscow telecasts will continue as before, Glubokov noted.
