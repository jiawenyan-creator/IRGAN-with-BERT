FT  05 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Whitehall's Iraq probe dilemma
CHANGES in rules for civil servants giving evidence to the Scott inquiry
into the sale of arms to Iraq indicate the need for legislation setting out
the role and responsibilities of civil servants, MPs were told yesterday.
Professor Peter Hennessey of Queen Mary College, London, told the
cross-party Treasury and Civil Service committee that the existing rules on
keeping advice to ministers confidential had been set aside for the inquiry
by Sir Robin Butler, head of the civil service.
Parliament, rather than an unelected official, should make such changes,
Prof Hennessey said. Legislation would put the rules governing civil
servants' behaviour on a statutory footing.
Prof Hennessey also backed the call by the FDA top civil servants' union for
an independent appeal body for civil servants who believed they had been
asked to behave unethically.
At present they must raise such matters with their line managers, with the
right to appeal to their permanent secretary and ultimately to the head of
the civil service.
However, he believed that civil servants would be reluctant to use this
appeal procedure, since their managers would often have been involved in
important decisions which led to disquiet. In the arms-to-Iraq affair, for
example, Sir Robin Butler had been present at some of the meetings
concerning the prosecution of the Matrix Churchill directors, he said.
