FT  23 DEC 92 / Bush and Yeltsin discuss N-pact
Presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin held their second telephone
conversation in two days on Monday to try to nail down a treaty making deep
cuts in strategic nuclear weapons, US official sources said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Washington.
'It's getting there. It's not a done deal yet but it's getting there,' one
official said of prospects for agreement on a new strategic arms reduction
treaty (Start-2) before Mr Bush leaves office on January 20.
Mr Yeltsin surprised Washington last week when he said a Start-2 agreement
was in hand and would be signed before Mr Bush hands over power to
President-elect Bill Clinton.
