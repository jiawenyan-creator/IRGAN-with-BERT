FT  09 APR 92 / Observer: Voters bash economy men
Italian voters have been especially unkind in their judgment of those
dealing with the economy. Veteran treasury minister Guido Carli and
forthright industry minister Guido Bodrato both lost their seats, as did
economist Nino Andreatta, head of the senate budget committee.
Carli's fate was especially poignant. Having co-opted him into government in
1989, the Christian Democratic party was keen to keep him on board even if
at first he could not be found a seat. At the 11th hour he was parachuted in
as a candidate for the senate in Genoa - alas, a city with which he had no
connection.
Just 78, the former central bank governor has been a lone voice in the
cabinet consistently urging fiscal discipline. But this held no appeal for
his new-found Genoese constituents. His sole consolation was that the native
Genoese Moana Pozzi, the self-styled porno-star and leading light of the
Love Party, also failed to get elected.
Among other prominent losers in the elections were the Christian Democrat
Gianuario Carta and the Socialist Guido Gerosa, respectively president and
vice-president of the senate commission investigating the Banca Nazionale
del Lavoro and its Atlanta branch's Dollars 4bn plus loans to Iraq.
Those with suspicious minds are seeing this decapitation as a conspiracy to
impede the investigation.
