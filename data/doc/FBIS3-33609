  [Excerpts] Santiago, 23 Feb (EFE) -- Chilean Interior 
Minister Enrique Krauss today characterized the terrorists who 
machine-gunned three young cadets from a prison service school 
in the last few hours and planted several bombs as "stupid, 
irrational, and cowards." [passage omitted] 
  DC [Christian Democratic Party] President Deputy Gutemberg 
Martinez said he thinks the terrorist attacks that began shortly 
before midnight on 22 February are an answer to the transfer of 
44 inmates serving sentences for terrorist activities to a new 
maximum-security prison, where there is a strict system 
regulating visits, and inmates will not be able to dig tunnels 
such as the two discovered in February. 
  Police think terrorist leaders, taking advantage of the 
weaknesses of the old Santiago jail system, have not only 
continued directing their respective groups but also have 
established coordinated action between different prisons. 
  Visits by relatives with direct contact with inmates have 
made possible the introduction of weapons into the prison. On 20 
February, two inmates and four guards were wounded when inmates 
being transferred to the new jail opened fire on the guards with 
half a dozen small guns. 
  Martinez said the new maximum security prison respects all 
the human rights of terrorists inmates, three of whom are in the 
third day of a hunger strike in defense of what their relatives 
describe as "the right to escape." [passage omitted]
