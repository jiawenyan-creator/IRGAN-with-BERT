 

Broader public participation in the form of written comments is also essential to this process and is being solicited
through this Notice. Comments received by May 2, 1994 will be considered by the five industry working groups in preparing
the reports which then will be presented by SBA at the second Forum. Public comments should be as specific as possible
and should focus on possible constructive solutions to any problems presented. Each submission should identify
the industry affected, so as to facilitate a referral to the appropriate industry working group. SBA, OIRA and the
participating agencies are particularly interested in comments concerning the following:




_Specific ways in which existing regulatory programs and the regulatory process can be made more ``user-friendly''
to small businesses. 

_Constructive suggestions for reducing forms and paperwork, particularly where they are duplicative, overly complicated
or otherwise burdensome for small businesses. 

_Effective ways to communicate with small business owners and to assist them in their understanding and implementation
of complex regulations. 

_Non-punitive methods for ensuring compliance with regulatory objectives or requirements, including preinspection
programs, advisory services, greater reliance on communication and dissemination of information, and industry
self-regulation.

_More effective ways to elicit participation from the private sector in efforts to simplify and clarify regulations
so that they are not overly complex or unduly difficult to interpret or implement. 

_Systematic ways to identify proposed regulations which are inconsistent with or duplicative of other regulations
of the issuing agency or other Federal agencies. 

_Suggestions for involving small business owners and their representatives in the rulemaking process in a more meaningful
way.




Written comments must be received no later than May 2, 1994, in order to be incorporated into the industry working group
reports to be presented at the second Small Business Forum on Regulatory Reform to be held in late June 1994. Comments
which are received thereafter will be reviewed by SBA's Office of Advocacy and, to the extent feasible, will be transmitted
to the affected agencies for their review as well.
