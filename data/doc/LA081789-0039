METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GIRL, 13, RECEIVES 27 YEARS TO LIFE IN 
KILLING 
A 13-year-old girl convicted of murdering a girl who switched gangs was 
sentenced to 27 years to life in prison Wednesday. 
The girl, sentenced in Compton Juvenile Court, was convicted of first-degree 
murder for the shooting of Patricia Tawana Thomas, 14, on June 2. Despite the 
heavy sentence, as a minor the 13-year-old can only be imprisoned until she is 
25. 
The slain girl was a friend of the killer when both belonged to the 118th 
Street East Coast Crips gang, said Dennis Fuhrman, a prosecutor assigned to the 
district attorney's Hardcore Gang Unit.
