FT  13 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese banks step up pace
of international withdrawal
THE PACE of Japanese banks' withdrawal from the international banking market
accelerated in the second quarter of this year, according to the BIS.
The Dollars 53bn reduction in their international banking assets - largely
accounted for by a continuing fall-off in inter-bank lending - was the
greatest ever recorded, leaving them with less than 30 per cent of all
international banking assets for the first time since 1986.
Largely as a result, the international banking system generated only Dollars
15bn of net new credit in the second quarter, half what it had managed in
the first three months.
This reversed what had been a gradual acceleration of international bank
lending since early in 1991, when the BIS had recorded the first-ever fall
in international banking activity.
This overall stagnant picture masked some sharp rises in international
assets by European banks.
Those of German banks jumped by Dollars 39bn, while French banks added
Dollars 31bn and those in Switzerland and the Benelux countries accounted
for an extra Dollars 30bn.
