FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Warning lops 24p off Metrotect share price
Shares of Metrotect Industries, which manufactures products to prevent
corrosion in pipelines, tumbled 24p to 80p after the anticipated jump in
first half profits was accompanied by a profits warning.
Mr Brian Thomas, chairman, said that unforeseen project delays would result
in a modest third quarter. The outcome for the full year was likely to fall
below the Pounds 2.36m reported for the 12 months to March 31, he added.
Nevertheless, he sounded an optimistic note: 'International pipeline
forecasts continue to run at a high level in areas where we enjoy a strong
presence and prospects remain good.'
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 559,000 to Pounds 801,000 in the six months
to September 30, the 43 per cent advance being achieved on turnover ahead 25
per cent to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 8.28m).
About 90 per cent of sales are exported to more than 20 countries, with main
markets including Thailand, India, Brazil, Indonesia and Iran.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.15p, twice covered by earnings of
2.33p (1.49p) per share.
