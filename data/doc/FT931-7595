FT  24 FEB 93 / Silesia backs wage demands
Railway workers in Silesia, Poland's most heavily industrialised region,
backed wage demands yesterday with a two-hour stoppage which disrupted local
passenger and freight traffic, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
They are demanding that wages for railway workers in the region, which
carries two-thirds of the country's freight traffic, should be 18 per cent
more than for rail employees elsewhere.
The stoppage comes after last week's successful 24-hour strike by miners in
the Solidarity trade union to demand that married people be taxed jointly on
their annual incomes, as was the case in 1992.
Meanwhile, Solidarity in the recession-hit textile town of Lodz, 120km west
of Warsaw, has called a 48-hour general strike beginning tomorrow to demand
the appointment of a special government official to oversee restructuring
plans for the area.
