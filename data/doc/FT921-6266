FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: WestLB advances 16% to DM970m
WESTDEUTSCHE Landesbank, the German regional public sector bank, yesterday
reported a 16 per cent rise in group operating profits to DM970m (Dollars
588m), helped by favourable interest rate margins and a low increase in
labour costs.
The Dusseldorf-based bank said its balance sheet total expanded by 11 per
cent to DM225bn. Excluding trading in foreign exchange and securities on its
own account, which contributed less to profits than in 1990 - DM143m against
DM166m - partial operating profits were 23 per cent higher at DM827m.
WestLB said its earnings on interest rate business were 15 per cent higher
last year at DM2.1bn, with commission income, affected by the slower
business in securities, 6 per cent higher at DM300m. Labour costs rose by 4
per cent to DM934m, with capital spending 17 per cent higher at DM827m,
including construction work and new computer installations.
Group net profits totalled DM195m, a rise of 56 per cent. The bank used part
of its income to increase its country risk provisions on foreign lending
(including the former Soviet Union).
These now stand at around 70 per cent of the total outstanding.
BIL GT, Liechtenstein's largest financial services group, reported net
income of SFr90.1m (Dollars 60.4m), more than double the SFr40.4m in the
previous year, writes Ian Rodger from Zurich.
The group, formerly known as Bank in Liechtenstein, was transformed into
primarily a fund management group following its acquisition of Britain's GT
Management in late 1989.
At the end of last year, it had SFr33.9bn under management, 19.8 per cent up
on the previous year-end, putting it in the same rank as Switzerland's
largest private banks.
The directors are recommending an increase in the 1991 dividend to SFr13 per
share or participation certificate from SFr12.
