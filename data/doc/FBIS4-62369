  [Text] Rome, 15 May -- Speaking to Italian journalists, 
former USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev did not rule out the 
possibility that he would put himself in the running at the 
presidential elections in Russia. M. Gorbachev is in Venice, 
where he was invited to attend a seminar on security policy 
problems organized by UNESCO and the European Institute for 
Cooperation between East and West. 
  Asked by journalists to comment on the international 
community's initiative on the Yugoslav crisis, M. Gorbachev 
opined that the recognition by the West of the sovereignty of 
former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia and Croatia was too hasty. 
As for the possibility of the use of force by Western powers to 
settle the conflict in former Yugoslavia, in his view the 
threats that force would be used testify to the weakness of 
international diplomacy. 
  Having stressed in his conversation with journalists that 
the 
communist model has become obsolete, M. Gorbachev noted that the 
liberal model, currently widespread in Europe, was also in 
crisis. 
  That is why new ideas and new parties are needed, he 
stressed.
