FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: UBS quits as broker to Proteus
UBS has resigned as joint broker to Proteus International, the
computer-aided drug designer, after disagreements over the speed with which
its products could reach the market.
UBS, which was appointed in October, believed Proteus was being too
optimistic about the time required to complete clinical trials and obtain
regulatory approval.
Proteus shares lost 31p to 394p yesterday, for a fall of 61p in the past
week.
Proteus appointed UBS in the hope of widening its institutional shareholder
base before the end of this year, when it will need to raise more money. But
Mr Kevin Gilmore, executive chairman, denied that UBS's resignation was a
serious blow to its funding plans.
Allied Provincial, which floated Proteus at 87p a share in 1990, will
continue as its broker and financial adviser.
