CLOTHESTIME, CITING SLOWDOWN, POSTS $83,000 LOSS IN 3RD QUARTER 
Blaming the economic slowdown that has gripped the retail fashion industry, 
Clothestime Inc. reported losses Tuesday of $83,000 for its third quarter ended 
Oct. 27, contrasted with year-earlier earnings of $2.3 million. 
The 383-store discount women's clothing chain said sales for the latest quarter 
were $48.6 million, down slightly from $48.8 million for the same period last 
year. 
The Anaheim-based Clothestime is "feeling some of the pressure of what is 
considered a more difficult retailing environment," said Amy Ludwig, a company 
spokeswoman. She said the retailer marked down merchandise because of slow 
sales during the quarter in order to make room for newer fashion lines. 
David Sejpal, Clothestime's chief financial officer, said a shift to a new 
strategy of offering lower-priced merchandise during the past 10 weeks should 
pay off in increased sales in the next six months to a year. 
Besides cutting prices on its merchandise, Clothestime has also been slashing 
inventories. Sejpal said the average store reduced inventory to $60,000 during 
the third quarter, down from about $100,000 a year ago. He said the retailer is 
also buying more discontinued fashion lines that can be offered at lower prices 
than those of competing retailers. 
Last week, an investment group that included the chairman and president of 
Clothestime's advertising agency said it had acquired a 6.3% stake in the 
retailer. Jack Roth, president of Admarketing Inc. in Los Angeles, said the 
group considered the stock a good buy.
