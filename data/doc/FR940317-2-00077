Requests for public use conditions must be filed with the Commission and the applicant by March 28, 1994. 
Any financial assistance offer must be filed with the Commission and applicant no later than March 27, 1994. The following
notation shall be typed in bold face on the lower left-hand corner of the envelope containing the offer: ``Office of
Proceedings, ABOFA''. Any offer previously made must be remade within this 10-day period. 
Information and procedures regarding financial assistance for continued rail service are contained in 49 U.S.C.
10905 and 49 CFR 1152.27. Requests for public use conditions must conform with 49 CFR 1152.28(a)(2).
