ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; 
5-CENT ALCOHOL TAX ENDORSED BY COUNCIL 
The City Council has unanimously endorsed the November ballot's 
"nickle-a-drink" initiative, which would raise taxes on alcohol. 
In a summary to other council members, Mayor Lida Lenney urged support for the 
initiative, noting that Laguna Beach police spend "a great deal" of time 
dealing with drunk drivers and family disputes fueled by alcohol abuse. 
The initiative would impose a surtax of 5 cents per 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces 
of wine and 1 ounce of distilled spirits. Money raised would be used for a 
variety of social services, including drug and alcohol abuse programs, domestic 
violence and child abuse prevention training and emergency medical care.LESLIE
