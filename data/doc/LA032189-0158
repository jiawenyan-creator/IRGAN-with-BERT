STODDARD QUITS ABC TO HEAD SPECIAL UNIT 
Brandon Stoddard has resigned as president of ABC Entertainment to form a new 
in-house production venture for Capital Cities/ABC, it was announced today. 
Stoddard will head an as-yet unnamed unit that will supply the network with 
series, movies and miniseries. 
NBC already has a similar unit, NBC Productions, headed by Brandon Tartikoff, 
who also is president of NBC Entertainment. At CBS, Vice President Norman 
Powell heads CBS Entertainment Productions and reports to Kim LeMasters, 
president of CBS Entertainment. 
Stoddard has headed the entertainment division since 1985; among the current 
prime time shows that have gone on the air during his tenure are "Roseanne," 
"Perfect Strangers," "Head of the Class," "Full House," "The Wonder Years," 
"China Beach," "Hooperman" and "thirtysomething." 
Stoddard said he had taken over as head of entertainment reluctantly and 
promised ABC's then-President Fred Pierce that he would see the network through 
"War and Remembrance," the final segments of which air in May.
