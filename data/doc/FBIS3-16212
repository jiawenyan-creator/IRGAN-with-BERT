  [Text] The Tajik armed opposition will stop fighting if 
peace talks between Dushanbe and the opposition are successful, 
Chairman of the Coordinating Center of Tajik Democratic Forces 
Atakhon Latifi told Interfax on Monday. 
  He said the opposition is not interested in a continuation 
of 
the civil war and does not want Tajikistan to become another 
Afghanistan. Latifi noted that currently preparations for the 
talks are going on. The talks will be held in Moscow, however 
the exact date is yet unknown. 
  Asked by Interfax's correspondent what demands the 
opposition 
put forward before the Dushanbe authorities, Latifi noted that 
the Council of National Accord, consisting of people who have 
not been involved in the civil war, should come to power 
temporarily. In Latifi's opinion, this government should 
conduct preparations for elections of a new parliament and do 
everything possible for the return of a million and a half 
refugees to their homeland. 
  Latifi pointed out that only after that it would be possible 
to hold elections and adopt a new constitution.
