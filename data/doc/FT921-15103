FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Fidelity's short-term blip - The Fund
Managers / The investment record of a performance-driven company
FOR A while in the 1980s, there seemed to be no stopping Fidelity
Investments. Its aggressive, performance-driven management style attracted
plenty of funds and some of the brightest fund managers.
But Fidelity has fared less well in the more depressed markets of the last
two or three years; its UK funds have been disappointing and the image seems
a little faded. Is this a temporary blip or a terminal decline?
Dick Haberman, chief investment officer of Fidelity Investments in the UK,
admits that the company 'has not produced the results we would have liked in
the UK' recently, but says the style will not change.
The Fidelity approach is not to sit behind a desk looking at sector
allocation. The emphasis is on being out in the field, visiting companies,
talking to management and picking stocks. Managers have great leeway and the
support of in-house analysts. They are rewarded generously when they perform
well, but mediocrity is not tolerated. This kind of approach is unlikely to
produce either a relaxed atmosphere or middle of the road performance.
Fidelity first started managing money in Boston in 1964. Its UK operation,
also an independent company owned by its executives, was started in the UK
in 1979. The US company currently has some Dollars 143bn (Pounds 78.5bn)
under management.
In the UK, funds under management are Pounds 3.3bn, of which Pounds 1.8bn is
in unit trusts. These are run by nine managers in the UK, two in the US and
two in the Far East. Fidelity has 30 analysts in the UK and 100 in the US.
The weakest spot in Fidelity's portfolio is its UK income and growth funds.
Haberman admits 'we have to do some work' on Growth &amp; Income, which has been
rather disappointing for the last three years. The performance of the higher
yielding Income Plus fund has also been below average.
The most noticeable laggard is Special Situations, which enjoyed a meteoric
rise at the end of the 1980s - indeed, it is fourth out of 63 UK growth
trusts over seven years. However, its run appears to have come to an end;
over the last three years, it has been 105th out of 126 in the sector.
The trust tends to buy cheap, unfashionable companies which are usually in
the higher risk/reward category, and these often perform worst in times of
recession and nervous stock markets. Recovery's performance slipped over
1991, for similar reasons.
Both funds include several companies which have heavy borrowings and
Haberman believes that 'the banks are pulling the plug on them much faster
than they used to because they are worried about non-performing loans.' This
again affects sentiment and all highly geared companies tend to get marked
down together.
Fidelity's Pounds 440m European fund had a bad time over most of 1991.
Manager Anthony Bolton attributes this to being too cautious about economic
growth in Europe. However, there has been a recovery and the fund is still
top in the European sector over five years.
Sally Walden manages both the smaller 1992 and European income funds, which
have very similar records over three years. European Income invested heavily
in financial stocks last year, and the fund benefited from its relatively
defensive stance. Only about 20 to 30 per cent of the fund is in fixed
interest stocks. The Opportunities fund invests in companies (including the
UK) which are supposed to gain from de-regulation or mergers and takeovers
as a result of the single market.
Moneybuilder and Managed International are run along slightly different
lines. Manager Bruce Russell has to take less of a 'bottom up' approach and
concentrate instead on asset allocation. The responsibility for choosing the
actual stocks in the funds rests with individual managers. Managed, which
invests in shares in several countries, has done well over both one and
three years, but Moneybuilder, which invests in Fidelity unit trusts, has
been disappointing, owing to holdings in the European and Special Situations
trusts.
In the US, the American Equity Income fund is in the bottom 25 per cent of
its sector on both a one and three year view. It is hoped that moving the
manager from London to Boston will help, as Boston's income funds have a
good record. Nevertheless, Haberman admits 'the jury is still out', although
he claims some underperformance was predictable since defensive income
stocks have been out of favour in the US.
In contrast, smaller companies have bounced back, and this has been
reflected in a strong performance by the US Special Situations fund in 1991.
The larger, American growth fund is in the top 25 per cent of its sector
over three years. These funds are also run from Boston, although by
different managers.
In the Far East, the record is mixed. The Japanese smaller companies fund
has done well over three years and the Far East Income fund is top of its
sector over two years; the other trusts have achieved below average
performances. Fidelity puts quite an effort into the region and has built a
team of local analysts and managers who should be at an advantage in
appreciating and understanding the complexities of the Far East.
Far East income's performance owes much to being underweight in Japanese
equities over the past year. About half of the trust is in yen bonds and
some 5 to 10 per cent in convertibles, the rest equities.
Much of Fidelity's recent underperformance can be attributed to misreading
the economic scenario and its value-based stock-picking style, which fares
badly in depressed markets.
If you buy Fidelity unit trusts, you are taking a risk, but historically
this has paid off. Over the long term, when equities usually outperform
other forms of investment, Fidelity's approach has worked. The group's
Special Situations fund, for example, has the sixth best performance of all
unit trusts over 10 years.
