FT  08 FEB 93 / Husband of Bhutto bailed
MR Asif Ali Zardari, the husband of Pakistan's opposition leader, Ms Benazir
Bhutto, has been released on bail after spending over two years in prison on
charges including aiding an attempted kidnapping, writes Farhan Bokhari in
Lahore.
Mr Zardari's release is seen as part of an opposition-government
rapprochement in Pakistan, though both sides deny such moves.
Other recent indications included a government-backed nomination for Ms
Bhutto to chair the parliamentary committee on foreign relations.
