FT  27 APR 93 / US healthcare plans worry trade unions
WITH the unveiling of the Clinton administration's healthcare reform plan
just weeks away, industries and trade unions are arguing nervously over the
degree to which businesses should be compelled to come into the scheme the
administration is expected to propose.
One core component of the reform is to be the creation of regional
purchasing pools, which the administration hopes will keep a lid on costs by
bringing to bear the buying power of thousands of people insured by their
employers or by state health schemes.
But big businesses may be allowed to stay outside these pools, according to
a report in the New York Times, prompting concerns particularly among trade
unions that this could undercut the equitable treatment of all citizens.
Mr Lane Kirkland, president of the American Federation of Labor-Congress of
Industrial Organisations, the main grouping of unions in the US, has written
to Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, who heads the White House healthcare reform
task force, arguing strongly against allowing employers to opt out.
One criticism that has been made of the proposal is that it would turn the
state-sponsored pools into dumping grounds for the poor and the sick and for
companies with older or less healthy workforces.
Most big businesses argue, however, that they already exert enough
purchasing power to keep down their health insurance costs on their own; if
they were forced into the state-sponsored pools, this could disrupt their
often complex labour agreements, which usually cover health benefits.
Administration officials say big employers would, in any case, be required
to comply with new federal guidelines on the type of health coverage they
give their workers.
The controversy encapsulates one of the dilemmas for reform: how to achieve
universal, government-mandated health coverage while avoiding a universal,
government-run health insurance scheme.
