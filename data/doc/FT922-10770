FT  29 APR 92 / RCN attempt to back health reforms blocked
AN ATTEMPT to force the governing body of the Royal College of Nursing to
declare its support for the aims of the government's National Health Service
reforms was rejected yesterday by its annual congress, Lisa Wood writes.
The college has opposed the speed of reforms, although it has not spoken out
against the reforms themselves.
Several speakers voiced their concerns over the future of the NHS. Professor
June Clark, president of the council, said she was worried about the
government's hidden agenda.
Mr David Nunn said the written aims of the government's reforms were to
improve patient care, quality and choice. The unwritten aims were to
commercialise the NHS, dismantle it and divide the workforce.
