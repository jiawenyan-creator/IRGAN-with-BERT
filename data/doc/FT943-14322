FT  15 JUL 94 / Walker 'accused director of disloyalty'
A former finance director of Goldcrest Films was accused by Mr George
Walker, the former Brent Walker chairman and chief executive, of disloyalty
and asked to reconsider his position after querying the company's accounts,
an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
Mr Frederick Fisher was giving evidence as a prosecution witness in the
trial of Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, the group's former finance
director.
The two are accused of fraudulently boosting Brent Walker Group's profits by
some Pounds 19m. They deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring
to falsify accounts.
Mr Fisher took over as finance director of Goldcrest, a Brent Walker
subsidiary, in 1990 from Mr Donald Anderson whom the prosecution alleges was
also party to the conspiracy to inflate profits.
Mr Fisher told the court that he had suggested including write-off
provisions in the film company's 1989 accounts that would have reduced its
reported profits and asset values. In spite of Mr Fisher expressing these
concerns to Mr Walker, the accounts appeared without the inclusion of these
write-offs, he said.
Mr Fisher told the court he queried the accounts with Brent Walker's
auditors. In a meeting with Mr Walker and Mr John Quested, another alleged
conspirator, Mr Walker angrily accused Mr Fisher of putting his personal
interests before those of the company.
Mr Walker said Mr Fisher's first responsibility was to himself as chief
executive. The conversation ended when Mr Walker asked the finance director
to consider his position with the company.
The trial continues next Monday.
