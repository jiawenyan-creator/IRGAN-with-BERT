 

Work Areas 



At paragraph (d)(6) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that work areas be so organized and spaced that the actions
of one employee will not create a hazard for any other employee. This paragraph also requires that each employee work
in a position or location that is within visual or audible contact with another employee. These provisions were adopted
from the proposed standard. The pulpwood logging and 1978 ANSI logging standards also recommended a two tree-length
distance between work areas. Requirements similar to the final rule exist in various State logging standards (Ex.
217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 38J, 38K). 

At paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that work areas be assigned so that trees cannot fall into
adjacent occupied work areas. This provision also requires that the distance between adjacent occupied work areas
be at least two tree lengths of the trees being felled. The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard contained
similar requirements. 

OSHA received comments supporting this provision (Ex. 529, 541, 567, 570; Tr. W2 163).
These commenters said that two tree lengths is already used in the industry to ensure safe spacing of work areas. Some
commenters, however, said that the provision should be limited (Ex. 528, 536, 539, 544,
549, 553, 554, 563, 574 through 592). One commenter said OSHA should require
minimum spacing requirements only when physical control of the timber was unpredictable, such as felling and skidding
(Ex. 528). Other commenters recommended that the requirement be limited to slopes that are greater than 25
or 35 percent (Ex. 521, 536, 539, 563). 

The purpose of these requirements is to protect employees in adjacent occupied work areas from being hit by misdirected
trees. One of the major causes of injury in the logging industry is being hit by a tree. According to the WIR survey, almost
one-quarter of all those injured were hit by a tree (Ex. 21). The State of Washington study showed that more than
65 percent of all employees were killed when they were hit by a tree or log (Ex. 4129). In addition, the study showed
that almost nine percent of that reported fatalities resulted from an employee being hit by a tree being felled by another
employee (Ex. 4129). 

Employees can be hit by a tree that falls in the wrong direction or by one that rolls or slides down sloping terrain. There
is no dispute that there is increased difficulty in directional felling on unlevel terrain. OSHA believes that these
work spacing requirements in the final rule will help to prevent these types of accidents. Moreover, adopting any
of the limitations that the commenters proposed would still leave employees exposed to other foreseeable hazards.
Since the two tree-length distance has become accepted practice in the industry, it appears that industry itself
recognizes the need for a minimum work spacing requirement and that the provision should not prove overly burdensome
for any establishments in the industry. 

In paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of the final rule OSHA is also requiring that employers assess conditions to determine whether
additional spacing between adjacent occupied work areas is necessary. Some of the conditions that employers must
examine include the degree of slope, the density of the growth, the height of trees, the soil structure, and other hazards
reasonably anticipated at that work site. This paragraph also requires that additional distance be maintained between
adjacent occupied work areas on any slope where rolling or sliding of logs is reasonably foreseeable. These provisions
were also contained in the proposed rule and in various State logging standards (Ex. 217, 218, 219,
220, 222, 38J, 38K). The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar requirement. 

Some commenters said greater distance should only be required when the slope is greater than 25 or 35 percent (Ex. 521,
536, 539, 563). These commenters, however, did not provide any information on why such a limitation
would provide adequate protection for employees. OSHA does not agree that greater distance may only be necessary
on such steep slopes. OSHA believes there is a potential for trees and logs to roll and slide on lesser slopes when conditions
such as snow and ice accumulation or wet soil are present. Therefore, OSHA does not believe that adequate protection
would be provided if the commenters' recommendation were adopted.
