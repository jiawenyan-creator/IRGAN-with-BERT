HUNTER TOPS WRESTLING CONTENDERS 
Westlake High's Billy Hunter is the favorite in the 175-pound division in the 
state championships today and Saturday at University of the Pacific in 
Stockton. 
Hunter, who won the Southern Section 4-A Division title last Saturday and is 
37-0 with 30 pins, finished second at 175 pounds in last year's state meet. 
He lost, 1-0, to Katella's Joe Pastorello. 
Hunter is one of five Valley-area Southern Section wrestlers who will make the 
trip. Westlake's Farzin Daneshnia (112) and Neal Mason (154), Agoura's Steve 
Baer (105), and Newbury Park's Jeff Jay (heavyweight) each finished third in 
the 4-A meet and will make their first appearances in the state meet. 
Four wrestlers from El Camino Real qualified for the state meet by winning 
their respective weight classes in the City Section finals: David Aparicio 
(112), Greg McMurray (119), Rob Steinbock (145), and Saul Emard (165). 
Canoga Park's Mario Acosta (98), Steve Pratt (126) and Chris Camarena (132) 
qualified, as did San Fernando's Greg Tan (154), Granada Hills' Karl Finley 
(175), Birmingham's Barak Isaacs (191) and Chatsworth's Lester Martinez
