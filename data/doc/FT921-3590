FT  13 MAR 92 / Appointments: Running London from Oslo
Den norske Bank, the struggling Norwegian bank, has made Anne Oian the new
chairman of its London subsidiary Den norske Bank PLC.
Oian, who has been at the bank since 1974, and, at one level below the main
board, ranks as its most senior woman, will remain in Oslo, where she is in
charge of group shipping activities - one profitable area of the bank.
She replaces Tom Grondahl, chairman since 1990, who had been head of the
international department, but, since the latter was merged with the large
corporates division at the beginning of this year, he is looking after
international financial institutions.
The Norwegians are also bringing John Simpson (below) back from Hong Kong to
become chief executive of Den norske's London operations, which comprises a
branch as well as the subsidiary. Simpson returns in May after his
secondment as chief executive of Unibank in Hong Kong.
