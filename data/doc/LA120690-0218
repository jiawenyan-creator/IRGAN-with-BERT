COMMUNITY DIGEST: HAWAIIAN GARDENS; 
ADMINISTRATOR REPORTEDLY RESIGNS AT REQUEST OF THREE 
Ronald Downing, Hawaiian Gardens city administrator, has resigned, reportedly 
after being ousted by three City Council members. They are the same three who 
recently forced H.M. (Lennie) Wagner to give up the mayor's post and Domenic 
Ruggeri to step down as vice mayor. 
Both remain on the council. 
There was no formal announcement about Downing's resignation. Wagner said she 
learned about it through a memo left in her City Hall mailbox from now-Mayor 
Rosalie Sher. Ruggeri said Downing was asked to resign during a special meeting 
of the council. Ruggeri said he and Wagner did not attend the meeting. 
Downing was named administrator in November, 1988, after serving three months 
as assistant administrator. He could not be reached for comment. His 
resignation letter is dated Nov. 16. 
According to Wagner and Ruggeri, the three council members who reportedly 
demanded the resignation were Sher, Kathleen Navejas and Esther Flores. Navejas 
said that was not true and that she would not discuss the resignation because 
it was a personnel matter.
