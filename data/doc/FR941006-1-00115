 

Among the 21 reported pediatric poisoning deaths that 
involved iron-containing products packaged in CRP, Table 4 shows 
that 29 percent (6/21) of these deaths resulted from iron- 
containing products whose child-resistant package was reportedly 
opened (actually or possibly) by the victim. In 14 percent 
(3/21) of these deaths, the CRP was reported to have been opened 
(actually or possibly) by another child. An adult was reported 
to have opened the CRP in 19 percent (4/21) of the pediatric iron 
poisoning deaths. Among the remaining reports of pediatric iron 
deaths in which the iron-containing product was packaged in 
child-resistant containers, the means of opening the container 
were not identified in 24 percent (5/21). The CRP was reported 
to be defective in 14 percent (3/21) of these deaths. 
Table 5 shows the total amount of iron ingested in the fatal 
poisoning incidents in which both the amount of tablets ingested 
and the iron potency of these tablets were reported. Among 17 
fatalities, in all but 1 case, the iron potency of the tablets 
was 60 to 65 mg, and with 1 exception (the same reported case), 
the calculated amount of iron ingested was at least 900 mg. 
The 70 case reports of NEISS followup investigations of 
nonfatal pediatric iron ingestions involved 80 children. The 80 
children were either treated in the emergency room and released 
or hospitalized for a period of time. Table 6 summarizes these 
case reports. The average age of the children was about 31 
months.
