METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CASE AGAINST PROSTITUTE WITH AIDS VIRUS 
RESET 
A convicted male prostitute was ordered to stand trial in Los Angeles Friday on 
a felony charge of continuing to solicit sex for money after being informed 
that he had tested positive for AIDS. 
Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Rand Schrader, who also chairs the Los 
Angeles County AIDS Commission, reversed an earlier decision and reinstated a 
case against Demitri Santangelo, 29, of Hollywood. 
Schrader's ruling to dismiss the charge last month was overturned on appeal to 
Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan.
