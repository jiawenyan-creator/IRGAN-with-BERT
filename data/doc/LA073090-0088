BRIEFLY 
OPEC Action to Affect Gas Prices: Retail gasoline prices at the pump will 
either rise or stay level the rest of the year -- instead of falling as they 
normally do -- as a result of the OPEC cartel's agreement Friday to curb oil 
output, analysts said. Ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries, which pumps more than a third of the world's crude, agreed 
to hold output, which had risen to 24.6 million barrels daily in April, to 22.5 
million barrels.
