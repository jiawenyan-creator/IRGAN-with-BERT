SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) has initiated a review to determine if Armenia meets the designation criteria
of the GSP law and should be designated as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, which is provided
for in the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 24612465). The designation criteria are listed in sections
502(a), 502(b), and 502(c) of the Act. Interested parties are invited to submit comments regarding the eligibility
of Armenia for designation as a GSP beneficiary. The designation criteria mandate determinations related to participation
in commodity cartels, preferential treatment provided to other developed countries, expropriation without compensation,
enforcement of arbitral awards, support of international terrorism, and protection of internationally recognized
worker rights. Other practices taken into account relate to the extent of market access for goods and services, investment
practices and protection of intellectual property rights. 



Comments must be submitted in 14 copies, in English, to the Chairman of the GSP Subcommittee, Trade Policy Staff Committee,
600 17th Street, NW., Room 517, Washington, DC 20506. Comments must be received no later than 5 p.m. on Wednesday, August
3, 1994. Information and comments submitted regarding Armenia will be subject to public inspection by appointment
with the staff of the USTR Public Reading Room, except for information granted ``business confidential'' status
pursuant to 15 CFR 2003.6. If the document contains business confidential information, 14 copies of a nonconfidential
version of the submission along with 14 copies of the confidential version must be submitted. In addition, the submission
should be clearly marked ``confidential'' at the top and bottom of each and every page of the document. The version
which does not contain business confidential information (the public version) should also be clearly marked at the
top and bottom of each and every page (either ``public version'' or ``non-confidential'').
