FT  05 MAY 93 / S Africa plans Angolan links
South Africa yesterday said it planned to reopen its diplomatic mission in
Angola, which it closed in November because of hostility over renewed civil
war, Reuter reports from Cape Town.
South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said the decision to send officials
back to the Luanda office was made following a meeting yesterday with the
former Angolan military commander, Gen Antonio dos Santos Franca.
The diplomats were withdrawn in November when fighting restarted after a
disputed election and the Angolan government accused Pretoria of resuming
support for Unita rebels.
