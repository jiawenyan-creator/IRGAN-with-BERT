FT  30 APR 93 / Letter: In defence of Attali's preference for marble
Sir, Your current enthusiasm for attacking Mr Jacques Attali and his
expensive toy, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, seems
to be seriously misdirected.
The essence of the criticism is that rather than lend huge amounts of
depositors' money to borrowers who are unlikely to repay any of it, Mr
Attali has chosen to invest his bank's limited resources in bricks and
mortar (or Carrara marble).
Given the disastrous record of most big international banks in trying to
make loans which are repaid, surely Mr Attali's policy should be commended?
Pawnbrokers and, until recently, building societies have coped quite
successfully with the intellectual challenges of money-lending. Bankers, on
the other hand, have in general failed abysmally and the least unsuccessful,
such as Mr Attali, have preferred to build palaces on the Bahnhofstrasse and
elsewhere, rather than to finance bankrupt countries, highly leveraged
management buy-outs or fantasy projects.
If Mr Attali's approach is considered too conservative by his shareholders,
no doubt Barclay's Mr Andrew Buxton could be drafted in to replace him and a
radical change in the bank's lending policy would then be assured.
