FT  27 FEB 92 / Carrington tries to get peace talks going again
LORD CARRINGTON is hoping to restart the stalled negotiations on Yugoslavia
within the next two weeks. The chairman of the European Community's peace
conference on Yugoslavia said after a meeting yesterday with Mr Slobodan
Milosevic, the Serbian president: 'We shall probably have a plenary
(session) in about 10 days time. . . when we can take stock of where we
stand.'
Although the fifteenth ceasefire in the Yugoslav conflict, brokered by the
United Nations on January 3, has mostly held in Croatia's war zones, little
progress has been made in political negotiations between the former Yugoslav
republics.
'The arrival of the (UN) peacekeeping troops does not in itself bring a
peaceful settlement,' said Lord Carrington. 'We've got to do what we can to
speed things up.'
The two men also discussed the situation in Krajina, the Serbian enclave in
Croatia, whose leaders had opposed the despatch of UN peacekeepers. About
14,000 UN troops are expected to arrive in three crisis zones in Croatia
over the next six weeks.
An EC-brokered conference on Bosnia-Hercegovina is due to resume today in
Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, before the weekend referendum on independence
in the central republic. The referendum has stirred fears of conflict among
the republic's volatile national mix of Slavic Moslems, Serbs and Croats.
About 44 per cent of Bosnia's 4.3m inhabitants are Moslems, 33 per cent are
Serbs and 17 per cent are Croats.
Violence is slowly increasing. Twelve people were hurt in a bomb blast in a
northern Bosnian town on Monday and a local official was killed the same day
in the west of the republic.
