MOLDAVIANS CALL OFF NEW DEMONSTRATION 
Moldavian nationalists called off a demonstration in their capital, Kishinyov, 
after 2,000 more troops were deployed in the city to prevent a repetition of 
Friday's clashes in which 180 people were injured. The city was reported calm 
as police guarded government buildings. Resignation of the republic's hard-line 
Communist leader, Semyon Grossu, is one of the central demands of the local 
Popular Front and other nationalist groups. The Popular Front also is demanding 
more autonomy for the republic, which was created largely out of Romanian 
territory in 1940, as well as the resignation of hard-line local leaders.
