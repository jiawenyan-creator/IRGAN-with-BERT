FT  19 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
IN A day of contrasts, the futures market powered to a large premium in busy
afternoon trading after a dull and largely negative start, writes
Christopher Price.
The December FT-SE contract opened lethargically at 2,684 in quiet business.
It traded at a discount to the cash market and drifted down amid concerns
over Gatt and the upcoming retail sales figures.
When they arrived the figures were a pleasant surprise but they only stirred
activity slightly and December traded around the 2,690-2,700 range until
around 2pm.
A strong rumour then appeared in the futures market suggesting that the Gatt
world trade talks had actually been settled and December was then moved
smartly forward.
There was some resistance at the 2,709 level, but after this was breached,
dealers reported heavy buying, which included a large programme trade.
December closed at 2,730, up 46 on the previous close and at a healthy
15-point premium to its fair value of around nine. Volume was 7,334
contracts compared with 6,165 lots previously.
In traded options, only 19,990 contracts were traded, over 8,000 of which
were in the FT-SE 100. Asda topped the stock options at 1,204, followed by
Rolls-Royce on 1,089, HSBC on 1,064 and British Gas with 599.
