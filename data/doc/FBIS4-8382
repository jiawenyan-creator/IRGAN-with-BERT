  [Text] Prague--Some 20,000 arms permits have been issued in 
the capital. The permit holders own 19,000 handguns, 5,000 
rifles, and 1,000 small-caliber firearms. M. Dohnal of the 
Prague police told reporters this yesterday. Last year, in 
comparison with 1992, the number of arms-permit applications 
doubled. According to Dohnal, this is caused by the growing 
number of businessmen who want to protect their property. The 
Interior Ministry is drafting a law on arms and ammunition. It 
should do away with the so-called group arms permits (there are 
800-900 of them in Prague) and require special training for 
applicants for individual permits and a psychological 
assessment. The policeman, unlike the legislators, believes 
that a permit should also be required for crossbows, which he 
described as very precise, quiet, and deadly. The law should go 
into effect at the beginning of next year. The theft of 
firearms is alarming; approximately 10 disappear in Prague every 
day.
