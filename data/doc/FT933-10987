FT  31 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris at 3-year high in
fevered activity
THERE was a general consensus that intense shuttle diplomacy, between Paris
and Frankfurt, would take place over the weekend with an announcement on the
future of the ERM coming either on Sunday or Monday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
Mr Sushil Wadhwani, European equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, said a
statement had to be made quickly as to how the monetary authorities
intended, if indeed that was their policy, to defend the current parities.
Noting that the outlook for French equities remained uncertain, he said that
he favoured Spain since the Bundesbank was more likely to continue defending
the franc than the peseta.
PARIS closed at its highest level since June 1990 as the opinion took hold
that the ERM was on the verge of break-up. The CAC-40 index closed up 49.88
or 2.45 per cent at 2,085.88 with turnover at an all-time high of FFr11.5bn,
compared with Thursday's FFr4.8bn. The CAC-40 has risen 4.5 per cent over
the week.
With unemployment data yesterday showing, as expected, another rise,
devaluation of the franc followed by cuts in interest rates, will provide
the economic impetus that is sorely needed, market commentators said.
With nearly all stocks showing strong advances, Peugeot featured a 5.5 per
cent gain to FFr683.
MADRID closed off its highs after profit-takers moved in on sharp gains seen
early in the day. The general index finished up 1.78 at 269.96 after a day's
high of 274.03, and 3.5 per cent higher over the week. Trading volume surged
to the second highest level of the year at Pta75bn, compared with an average
of Pta10bn-PTa15bn over the last three weeks.
Mr Hugh Bailey, of Schroders in London, said profit-taking emerged in the
last two hours of trading as currency speculators appeared to ease their
heavy pressure on the French franc, which in turn took some of the pressure
off the peseta.
Gains were focused on the banking sector where Banesto rose Pta125 to
Pta2,170, in spite of announcing an 82 per cent fall in first half profits.
LISBON moved steadily ahead on renewed strong demand for blue chips and the
BTA index added 27.7 to 2,257.6, up 4.2 per cent over the week.
FRANKFURT managed to regain the 1,800 level by the close, having slipped to
an intraday low of 1,799. The DAX index finally closed down 30.47 at
1,803.23, a week's fall of 1.5 per cent. Turnover was DM8bn.
Among the biggest fallers were export-sensitive stocks, while banks also
eased. Deutsche Bank, which has attracted positive recommendations this week
on its interim results, lost DM3 to DM737.
Volkswagen lost DM7.80 to DM348.20; after the close Mr Ferdinand Piech, the
chairman, said that he had offered to meet the head of General Motors.
BRUSSELS rose almost 2 per cent on hopes for a realignment, with
dollar-sensitive and industrial stocks making the largest gains. The Bel-20
index rose 26.35 to 1,326, up 1.5 per cent on the week.
ZURICH was steady, an interested observer of the turmoil elsewhere, and the
SMI index rose 0.3 to 2,400.9 for a 2.1 per cent rise on the week.
'We are staying on the sidelines at present, but if Germany cuts its rates,
then Switzerland would follow suit,' said Mr Mirko Sangiorgio, of Bank
Julius Baer in Zurich. 'The Swiss franc is strong so we have plenty of room
to react.'
Nestle added SFr4 to SFr1,049 in heavy trading in response to its purchase
of Italgel, the frozen foods company, from Sme of Italy.
VIENNA slid in tandem with Frankfurt, and ATX index ended down 21.22 at
948.59, up 1.3 per cent on the week after gains earlier in the week.
AMSTERDAM saw some wild price fluctuations during a session which was
dominated by short-covering in the morning session. The CBS Tendency index
rose 0.7 to 122.0, a gain of 3.4 per cent over the week.
COPENHAGEN retreated a little on late profit-taking but turnover was high at
DKr1bn as the KFX index added 0.57 to 91.87. STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden index
gained 8.90 to 1,203.00 with Ericsson B shares up SKr9 at SKr373, while
OSLO's all share index was up 1.5 per cent at a new year's high, closing at
531.42. In HELSINKI the HEX index rose 12.3 to 1,287.4.
MILAN made progress in the wake of a firmer lira and a rally in government
bonds as the ERM turmoil improved the prospects of lower interest rates. The
Comit index advanced 2.19 to 563.3, a rise on the week of 2.4 per cent.
Mr Nicholas Potter, of Credito Italiano International in London, commented
that while Italy would not take the lead in a round of interest rate cuts
throughout Europe, it would certainly follow and that would be good for the
corporate sector.
Sme shed L399 or 6.5 per cent per cent to L5,751 with the sale of Italgel
realising less than the forecast price.
ISTANBUL rose 1.2 per cent, the composite index ending up 120.97 at
10,077.60, a week's gain of 3.2 per cent. After the close the central bank
governor announced his resignation, due to long-standing policy differences
with Ms Tansu Ciller, the prime minister.
