SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN DIMAS; 
PANEL TO WOO DEVELOPER 
A City Council subcommittee has been created to explore whether Century 
American developers, who in August turned to the county for approval of a 
119-home development in an unincorporated island north of Via Verde, can be 
persuaded to resume discussions with the city. 
Mayor Pro Tem Maria Tortorelli and Councilman Sandy McHenry were named to the 
subcommittee last week, when the council voted unanimously to go on record 
opposing the project, which is being processed by the county. 
Roger Hobbs, president of Century American, an Orange-based development firm, 
told the council he abandoned the city's review process after at least 16 
months of discussion with a city review panel only because he was uncertain of 
support from the council. He said the company would like a joint city-county 
project.
