 

End-user applicants whose businesses were unrelated to the petroleum industry were presumed injured by the motor
gasoline overcharges covered by the Remedial Order. These applicants need only document the volume of motor gasoline
they purchased from one of the gasoline retailers in this proceeding in order to be eligible to receive a refund. 
We are proposing to adopt a small claim presumption of injury for reseller and retailer applicants seeking refunds
of $5,000 or less, exclusive of interest. These applicants will not be required to prove injury. In order to be eligible
to receive a refund in this proceeding, a small claim applicant need only document the volume of motor gasoline he purchased
from one of the gasoline retailers listed in the appendix. 
Only claims for at least $15 in principal will be processed. We have adopted this minimum in refined product refund
proceedings because the cost of processing claims for refunds of less than $15 outweighs the benefits of restitution
in those instances. See Mobil Oil Corp., 13 DOE 85,339 (1985). 
The deadline for filing an Application for Refund is June 1, 1995. 
It Is Therefore Ordered That: 
The refund amount remitted to the Department of Energy by Aptos Shell and the 4 other firms listed in the Appendix, pursuant
to the Remedial Order finalized on December 14, 1981, be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.



Dated: April 28, 1994.
