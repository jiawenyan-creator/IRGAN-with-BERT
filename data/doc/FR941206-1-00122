2013.001

General.



(a) The Federal information Resources Management Regulation (FIRMR) is codified in the Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) and includes interim rules which have the same effect as codified material.

(b) From time to time, the General Services Administration (GSA) will issue nonregulatory publications to provide
guidance and information:

(1) FIRMR bulletins contain guidance and information on various information resources management areas. FIRMR
bulletins do not constitute binding authority, but should be used as an aid in understanding GSA programs and the FIRMR.
FIRMR bulletins are published in Appendix B of the looseleaf edition of the FIRMR and are available along with the FIRMR
from GPO by subscription or on GSA's CDROM.

(2) Handbooks and reports address specific program or technical areas where the audience generally will be defined
by the subject matter.

(3) Appendix C of the looseleaf edition of the FIRMR contains a listing of current bulletins, handbooks, and reports
and information on how to obtain them.

in the formulation of the final change to the FIRMR.
