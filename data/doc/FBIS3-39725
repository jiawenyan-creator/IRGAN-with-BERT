  [Excerpt] PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat has asked the 
Netherlands to mediate in the peace process in the Middle East. 
He made his request at a meeting with members of the Dutch 
Government in The Hague. It is not yet clear whether the 
Netherlands is prepared to take on the role of mediator. 
  'Arafat said the peace talks with Israel have reached a 
critical phase. If agreement on Palestinian autonomy is not 
reached soon, he said, the credibility of the peace process will 
be threatened. He added that Israel has agreed to release all 
Palestinian prisoners. Their release was one of the PLO's 
conditions for a peace accord with Israel. [passage omitted]
