  [Text] Fukuoka, May 19 KYODO -- Police took a 27-year-old 
Japanese gangster into custody early Thursday [19 May] in 
connection with an alleged Chinese smuggling case in which 138 
Chinese suspects have been arrested on suspicion of illegally 
entering Japan. 
  Police officials identified the Yakuza as Ryuji Abiru, who 
was found with the 138 Chinese Wednesday in a warehouse at 
Hakata port in Fukuoka in Japan's southernmost main island of 
Kyushu. 
  The Chinese were apprehended along with Abiru, who was 
carrying a Japanese driver's license. 
  Fifteen of the 138 Chinese were women, police said. 
  Fukuoka prefectural police raided offices and other 
locations 
early Thursday to determine if the alleged smuggling case was 
part of a massive scheme to bring in Chinese and other 
foreigners for cheap labor. 
  Police raided the warehouse Wednesday after receiving a tip 
from a citizen who suspected there was a group of foreigners in 
the building. 
  Two temporary toilets had been built in the warehouse, which 
was leased to a man who reportedly described himself as an 
"importer." 
  One of the Chinese earlier said, "we have come to find jobs 
in Japan. We are victims."
