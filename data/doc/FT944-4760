FT  07 DEC 94 / Air traffic control to be 'sold secretly'
The government is secretly planning to sell off air traffic control, Mr
Henry McLeish, Labour's transport spokesman, said yesterday.
He said the Civil Aviation Authority's budget was to be cut so severely that
only through privatisation could it make its targets.
The CAA's external financing limit is to fall from Pounds 52m in 1994-95 to
Pounds 27m in 1995-96 and to Pounds 3m in 1996-97. It will rise to Pounds 6m
in 1997-98.
Mr McLeish said this meant air traffic control was to be privatised 'without
even the decency of a public statement'.
He said responses to the government's air traffic privatisation proposals
had been published in an obscure parliamentary written answer.
They showed 188 people had responded to a privatisation paper, yet 168
opposed the plan or expressed doubts.
Of the 14 supporting the government one was a Conservative MP, three were
potential competitors to the CAA and three were privatisation consultants.
Mr McLeish said: 'Never has the lack of support for the dogma of
privatisation been so clearly demonstrated.' CAA figures published yesterday
suggest that package holidaymakers are still bearing the brunt of airport
delays.
Only 51 per cent of charter flights in to and out of airports in April-June
1994 were on time (within 15 minutes) compared with 52 per cent for the same
period last year.
For the same period, 83 per cent of scheduled flights were on time compared
with 79 per cent in the corresponding period last year and only 73 per cent
in the same period in 1992.
The CAA figures showed that in the period April-June just 50 per cent of
Gatwick airport charter flights were on time, compared with 52 per cent in
the same period last year. At Manchester airport only 49 per cent of
charters were on time, compared with 52 per cent in April-June 1993.
