FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: ITT to sell consumer loan
portfolio
ITT, the US conglomerate, yesterday speeded up the re-orientation of its
troubled Consumer Financial Corporation subsidiary by announcing plans to
sell a poorly-performing loan portfolio. It intends selling its domestic
unsecured consumer small loan portfolio to an investment group.
The investment group is led by an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs, the New York
investment bank, and includes ITT, with a 15 per cent equity holding, and
Household International, the credit servicing company, with a 25 per cent
stake. Household will service the loan portfolio.
The portfolio had an end-February face value of Dollars 2.18bn. ITT, which
expects to report a small gain on the sale in the second quarter, will
receive around Dollars 1.7bn in cash, including Dollars 400m of loan payment
collections between the end of February and the June 1 completion of the
deal.
The deal follows ITT's announcement last January that it was changing the
focus of the consumer finance business, away from the domestic unsecured
area, which has been hit by the growing popularity of credit cards and the
increasing willingness of Americans to file for personal bankruptcy.
The unit plans to focus on secured lending, particularly in the mortgage
field.
At the time of the January announcement, ITT established reserves of Dollars
796m to cover losses from the run-off of the unsecured portfolio and office
closures.
The portfolio was written down to 65 cents on the dollar, but yesterday's
agreement puts a price on it of just over 79 cents.
Mr Rand Araskog, ITT's chairman, said the transaction 'maximises the
shareholder value of the loan portfolio through sale rather than
liquidation.' Shares in ITT rose on the New York Stock Exchange following
the announcement, closing Dollars 3 higher on the day at Dollars 83 3/4.
