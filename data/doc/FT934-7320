FT  20 NOV 93 / American Airlines sues strikers
AMERICAN Airlines said yesterday it had filed a law suit in Texas charging
the trade union representing striking flight attendants with falsely
implying that the carrier's operations were unsafe.
The airline, the second-largest US carrier after United, took the action on
Thursday after 21,000 members of the Association of Flight Attendants began
an 11-day walkout over proposed changes in staffing, work rules and fringe
benefits. The strike is intended to disrupt American's flights during the
busy Thanksgiving day holiday period.
American, a division of AMR, has tried to continue operating with other
employees trained to replace the strikers temporarily. It was also
recruiting new flight attendants at its headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas,
and 30 other cities.
The suit charges that the union and its public relations firm, Abernathy &amp;
Mitchell of Washington DC, have asked travel agents to steer customers away
from American flights on the grounds that its staffing levels and training
programme were unsafe.
Mr Ray Abernathy of Abernathy &amp; Mitchell, denied that the firm or the union
had ever 'alleged or implied American Airlines' operations or aircraft were
unsafe'.
The airline is seeking unspecifed damages for business losses and Dollars
10m (Pounds 6.7m) in punitive damages.
On the first day, the strike appeared to be far more successful than the
airline had expected. The union said about 90 per cent of its members at
American were honouring picket lines and the airline's system was 'virtually
shut'.
The airline had to cancel many flights and restrict others to freight and
mail. Many passengers were found seats at competing airlines.
