CLIPPERS CONTINUE FALL, LOSE TO WARRIORS 
Not even the Miami Heat has lost as many consecutive games as the Clippers. 
The Clippers' spiral continued Saturday night as Chris Mullin scored 24 points 
to lead the Golden State Warriors to a 116-107 victory. It was the Clippers' 
18th straight loss. 
Winston Garland, Terry Teagle and Mitch Richmond scored 18 points each and 
Larry Smith had 16 rebounds for the Warriors, who got their eighth straight 
home victory. 
Ken Norman scored 28 points for the Clippers (10-35), who surpassed Miami's 
previous National Basketball Assn. season high of 17 consecutive defeats. They 
are one shy of the franchise record and two short of the league single-season 
record set by the Philadelphia 76ers in 1972-73. 
Quintin Dailey, the Clippers' leading scorer, hit his head on the court with 
10:39 left in the second quarter and left the game with a mild concussion. 
Teammate Tom Garrick left early in the fourth quarter with a sprained ankle. 
Manute Bol came off the bench to block three shots and made a 3-pointer from 
the top of the key as the Warriors began to pull away during a 38-point second 
quarter. 
Mullin scored 12 points in that period as Golden State built a 60-49 lead with 
2:18 left in the half. 
Otis Smith's two free throws with eight seconds left gave Golden State its 
largest first-half lead at 66-53 before Norm Nixon made a 3-pointer with one 
second remaining. 
Norman scored 11 points in the third quarter, and the Warriors led 94-83 at the 
start of the fourth quarter.
