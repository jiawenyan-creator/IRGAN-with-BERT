FT  07 JUL 92 / OFT likely to attack ITV network plan
THE Office of Fair Trading is likely to be critical of two crucial aspects
of proposed central networking arrangements for the new independent
television system, to be set up next year.
There is disquiet about ITV's insistence that independently produced
programmes made for the ITV network must be made through sponsoring ITV
companies, and about ITV's wish to buy rights to such programmes for up to
15 years.
Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association, has made it clear that the
purpose of buying such rights would be to prevent potential competitors
getting access to them.
There is a growing feeling that both ITV policies could be interpreted as
prima facie breaches of competition rules.
The OFT, which has a statutory duty under the 1990 Broadcasting Act to
ensure that ITV's networking arrangements are not anti-competitive, plans to
publish a discussion document later this month.
Independent access and control of programme rights will be identified in the
document as 'issues', although the OFT has not decided how forthright the
public discussion should be. The competition body has further work to do and
more evidence to hear before it makes up its mind, probably in the autumn.
It is clear, however, that strong evidence against the need for independent
producers to be sponsored by ITV companies has already been submitted to the
OFT.
The ITV companies, backed by the Independent Television Commission, have
argued such sponsorship is needed because from the beginning of next year
each ITV company will be the legal programme publisher. It has been pointed
out, however, that this could not apply to programmes bought in from the US
or to news.
