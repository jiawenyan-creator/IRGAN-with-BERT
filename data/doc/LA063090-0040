35 NATIONS ENDORSE DEMOCRACY TENETS 
Thirty-five nations ended a four-week conference in Copenhagen after committing 
themselves to multi-party democracy and the rule of law in a landmark 
declaration. 
The nations belong to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
which includes the United States, Canada, the Soviet Union and all European 
countries except Albania. "This is the most important CSCE document since the 
Final Act was adopted in Helsinki 15 years ago," said Danish Foreign Minister 
Uffe Ellemann-Jensen. The document commits members to pluralism, free 
elections, an independent judiciary and the separation of the state from 
political parties.
