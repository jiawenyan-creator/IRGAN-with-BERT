<DOCTITLE>Cultural Resources Industry Outreach Training Course</DOCTITLE>


August 15, 1994.


The Office of Pipeline Regulation (OPR) staff will convene another session of its cultural resources compliance
training course. This is a result of the positive response to our first session held on August 2, 1994 in Washington,
D.C., and to our survey for another date and location. We are holding this course so that additional members of the regulated
pipeline industry and interested individuals and organizations can gain an understanding of:
&bull;How the Commission gives the industry and the public an opportunity to assist the Commission in meeting its
responsibilities under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and other historic preservation laws and
regulations; and
&bull;What cultural resources information the industry needs to file with the Commission before and after the Commission
issues a certificate.
We encourage interested organizations and the public to take advantage of this course.
The course will include the following topics:
&bull;Objectives and requirements of the Commission regarding compliance with 106 of the NHPA and related
historic preservation laws;
&bull;Guidance for reporting on cultural resources investigations;
&bull;Definition of cultural resources terms used by the Commission in the compliance process; and
&bull;Efficient strategies for planning and conducting cultural resources investigations.
The one-day training course will be held on September 21, 1994, at the Wyndham Greenspoint Hotel, 12400 Greenspoint
Drive, Houston, Texas 770601998. For hotel reservations, please call 17138752222 by
September 9, 1994 and identify yourself as a cultural resources seminar attendee.
The OPR staff and Enserch Environmental, the Commission's environmental support contractor, will conduct the training.
There is no fee for the course, but you must pre-register.
Additional outreach training may be offered later this year and in 1995 based on the level of interest. Please indicate
whether you would like this course to be offered again, or if you are interested in any other courses with a different
curriculum focus or for another target audience. Also indicate your preference for location. If other sessions or
