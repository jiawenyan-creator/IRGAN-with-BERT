FT  23 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: The reality for miners represented by
unions in American pits
Sir, Robert Taylor's description of the US mining industry, Peabody's role
in it and the strike being waged by the United Mine Workers of America
('Hanson unions plan worldwide link-up', September 9) unfortunately creates
a picture at odds with the facts.
Rather than 'setting the pace for non-unionism' as Mr Taylor reports,
Peabody Coal Company and our affiliate, Eastern Associated Coal Corp, are
attempting to preserve our union-represented mines in the face of increasing
competition from non-union operations. All of the miners employed by the two
companies, it should be noted, are members of the United Mine Workers
(UMWA).
The reality facing union-represented miners in the US is clear and
straightforward: if mines employing UMWA members are going to continue to
exist, they must operate under a contract that enables them to be cost
competitive with non-union mines. That is precisely why the multi-employer
bargaining group of which Peabody Coal and Eastern Associated are members,
the Bituminous Coal Operators' Association (BCOA), has offered proposals to
the union that would increase competitiveness and, at the same time, expand
job opportunities for union-represented miners.
The need for competitiveness is readily apparent when you look at the US
coal industry's employment and production figures. Today, non-union
operators produce 70 per cent of the coal and employ 60 per cent of the
miners - quite the reverse of Mr Taylor's description of 'an industry where
two-thirds of the 100,000 miners are still organised'.
Finally, Mr Taylor's reference to Peabody as 'the leading negotiator for the
mine owners' does disservice to the BCOA. It is important to understand that
each member of the BCOA's four-person negotiating committee has an equal
vote; further, BCOA's lead negotiator is from another coal company - not
Peabody.
