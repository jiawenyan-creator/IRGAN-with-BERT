FT  20 FEB 92 / C and W appoints new chief
CABLE and Wireless appointed a new chief executive yesterday, completing a
management shake-up instituted by Lord Young, the telecommunications group's
executive chairman, after he joined 18 months ago.
Mr James Ross, chairman and chief executive of BP America, the oil group,
takes up the job on May 1. He fills a position which has been vacant since
Mr Gordon Owen resigned last year.
Lord Young said it was 'more important to get a good international manager
than someone who knows telecommunications'.
Mr Ross is expected to be responsible for day-to-day management with Lord
Young, a former Conservative cabinet minister, keeping control of strategy
and political liaison. 'Someone has got to look at the wood and someone has
got to look at the trees,' Lord Young said.
Mr Ross, a UK citizen, has a reputation for having a safe pair of hands and
is thought unlikely to challenge Lord Young's authority. 'He is more of a
statesman and organiser than a street fighter,' said a stockbroker who
follows the oil industry.
The stockbroker said Mr Ross was not seen as a candidate for the top job at
BP and dismissed suggestions his move could be connected with reports of
boardroom divisions at the oil group. Mr Ross, 53, has been with BP since
1959, working in France, Africa, the UK and the US.
Top C and W executives will report to Mr Ross. These include Mr Peter van
Cuylenberg, executive director in charge of the group's businesses in
developed countries, who had been hoping for the job.
C and W will launch a new corporate identity later today, changing the
current logo, replacing the 'and' in Cable and Wireless with '&amp;'.
