FT  02 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Fear of flying
The wise men's report on the European airline industry will bring the day of
reckoning for loss-making national carriers that little bit closer but will
hardly leave them quivering with fear. The recommendation that carriers can
receive one last injection of state aid - so long as it is linked to
restructuring proposals - will defer the most painful decisions. Once that
financial fix has faded, the upswing in the European aviation cycle should
further postpone the crunch.
The report suggests that over the past three years European governments have
spent Dollars 3bn shoring up national airlines. None of the investment could
be justified on purely commercial grounds. That may be true. But whether the
elimination of such subsidies will be sufficient to redress the ills of the
European airline industry is highly questionable. After all, US carriers
receive no state aid yet their industry still loses money. That shows how
hard it is to remove surplus capacity.
Strong European airlines, such as British Airways and KLM, will be delighted
that 'unfair' competition will diminish. But small airlines on Europe's
periphery, such as Olympic or Aer Lingus, will face a highly precarious
future if free market forces are fully unleashed. The regulatory trend will
force them to cut costs, merge or forge closer marketing agreements with
other carriers. But even if they fail to do so, it is hard to see how any
government could ever allow its national carrier to crash. The release of
the aviation report on the same day as the EU commissioner responsible
admitted that European steel talks were on the verge of collapse is not
auspicious for free market champions.
