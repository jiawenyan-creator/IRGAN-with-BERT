  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 14/6/1994 -- "We have succeeded 
in the first four months of this year to ensure a monetary 
stability absolutely necessary for the country to gain more 
credibility, to build confidence of domestic and foreign 
investors in the national currency, and initiate several 
privatization actions," Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu 
said during a television interview. 
  "Over the same period we have managed to curb inflation by 
50 
percent and, from latest statistic data available, inflation is 
expected to go farther below by 5 percent, that is much better 
than estimated for the first five months," Premier Vacaroiu said. 
  "In the ensuing months inflation should have to go below by 
about 1 to 3 percent, according to governmental forecasts, which 
would mean a powerful cut on interests and a better economic 
growth," is the opinion of the Romanian premier. 
  Showing that the executive has attached special importance 
to 
further the process of economic restructuring and privatization, 
Premier Vacaroiu showed his discontent over the fact that the 
pace of this process is not as previously estimated, "two 
hundred privatized companies this year is still a small number." 
  Concluding his interview, Premier Vacaroiu mentioned that 
economic forecasts for this year are envisaging "an industrial 
production growth of about 2 percent and a growth of the gross 
domestic product by 1.5 percent, under the circumstances of a 
rate of inflation that would not exceed 70 percent, a possible 
fact as we have so far followed in the steps we planned."
