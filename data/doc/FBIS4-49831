  [Text] Chongqing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Sichuan Province is accelerating the construction of its 
Chengdu-Chongqing expressway. 
  The present highway from Chengdu city, capital of Sichuan 
Province, to Chongqing city, a major industrial center in the 
region, was constructed in the 1930s and the average speed of 
automobiles on the 430-kilometer highway is only about 25 
kilometers per hour. 
  In 1987, the Chinese Government decided to construct the 
expressway and listed the project as one of the key projects of 
the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period. 
  The total investment in the project amounts to 3.9 billion 
yuan. 
  The project was started in October 1989 and received World 
Bank loans of 120 million U.S. dollars. 
  The expressway is 340 kilometers in length, 98 kilometers 
shorter than the old highway and 165 kilometers shorter than the 
Chengdu- Chongqing Railway. 
  When the expressway opens to traffic, it will take three to 
four hours to drive from Chongqing to Chengdu. 
  The expressway has 261 bridges and many tunnels. The 
Zhongliangshan Tunnel, which is 6,268 meters in length, has been 
completely cut through. 
  The project is expected to be completed in July 1995.
