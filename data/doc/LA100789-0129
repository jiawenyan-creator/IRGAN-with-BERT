ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE; 
COLUMBUS ANNIVERSARY PANEL ESTABLISHED 
The Board of Supervisors has established a Christopher Columbus Quincentenary 
Commission to plan and execute celebrations commemorating the 500th anniversary 
of Columbus' voyages of discovery. Officials said the celebrations will reflect 
the heritage of the countries that were involved with and committed to 
Columbus. 
At this time, the agenda of the Orange County commission includes the 
preparation of a video history and documentary on the Spanish settlers in the 
area, a boat parade in Newport Harbor and a Columbus Day parade and banquet. 
The kickoff event will be a reception and preview of the exhibit "Christopher 
Columbus: From Genoa to the New World" at Bowers Museum in Santa Ana on 
Thursday. 
The commission is responsible for all costs incurred for hosting the 
celebrations and is soliciting assistance of individuals and companies 
throughout Orange County.
