FT  29 JUN 94 / Opencast payout boost is defeated
Compensation paid to owners of land used for opencast mining must reflect
the fact that the coal belongs to the nation, the government insisted in the
Commons last night.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, successfully called on MPs to overturn a
Lords amendment to the bill privatising the coal industry which sought to
provide more generous compensation. He said the value of the coal should not
be transferred to the landowner, either directly or indirectly.
The Lords' amendment was defeated by a government majority of 68 (291-223).
Labour MPs backed the Lords' amendment, with Mr Martin O'Neill, shadow
energy minister, arguing that it would have the effect of making it easier
for deep-mined coal to compete with that from opencast sites.
The spread of opencast mining was attacked from both sides of the House and
the government was urged not to permit companies to gain access to sites
through compulsory rights orders.
An announcement by the environment department removing a reference to the
'national interest' in planning guidance - to ensure that it would no longer
be seen as amounting to a presump-tion in favour of mining development -
failed to satisfy the critics.
Mr Eggar said a government amendment introduced as a replacement for the
provisions inserted by the Lords made clear that the assessment of market
value in determining compensation must be based on the fact that the nation
owned the coal.
