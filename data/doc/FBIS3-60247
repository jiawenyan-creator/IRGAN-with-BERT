  [Text] Tokyo, Dec. 22 KYODO -- Russia's dumping of liquid 
nuclear waste did not have any impact on marine life in the Sea 
of Japan, the government said in an interim report Wednesday [22 
December]. 
  The Maritime Safety Agency, the Meteorological Agency and 
the 
Fisheries Agency jointly conducted the survey at 14 sites in the 
Sea of Japan shortly after Russia dumped 900 tons of low-level 
liquid nuclear waste at sea in mid-October some 550 kilometers 
west of Hokkaido. 
  Judging from preliminary results, however, fish and other 
seafood analyzed were not more contaminated by radiation than in 
previous surveys. 
  The samples were taken from Japanese fishing grounds, which 
are some 200 kilometers away from the dumping site. A survey of 
the area close to the site is expected to be carried out in 
cooperation with Russia and South Korea soon, but not before 
mid-January, officials said. 
  A spokesman for the Russian Pacific fleet told KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE the fleet does not intend to resume nuclear waste 
dumping in the near future or to ask Moscow to issue a relevant 
permit. 
  A scheduled second dumping in October was canceled following 
international protests, especially from neighboring Japan and 
South Korea, over the danger of contaminating the environment. 
  Despite the halt to dumping other potential risks remain, 
the 
spokesman said. The fleet has reportedly passed its storage 
capacity for liquid nuclear waste and the tankers carrying the 
dangerous cargo are outdated, he said. 
  In talks with Russian officials and experts on the nuclear 
waste issue on Tuesday, Japan basically agreed it will supply a 
tanker to help Russia over the storage bottleneck. 
  "If this is realized, I think we can avoid the resumption of 
dumping for the time being," the spokesman said.
