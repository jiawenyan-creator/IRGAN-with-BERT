IT'S OFFICIAL: KOVIC WON'T RUN FOR CONGRESS 
Ron Kovic officially declared Thursday that he has decided against seeking the 
Democratic nomination to challenge Rep. Robert K. Dornan, (R-Garden Grove). 
A statement released by Kovic, the wounded Vietnam veteran whose life story is 
told in the movie "Born on the Fourth of July," gave no reason for bowing out. 
The statement said: "After much careful thought and consideration, I have 
decided not to run. I love this country very much, so I will continue to speak 
out and support political candidates and issues which articulate the vision of 
a new, even better America and a more peaceful world." 
The prospect of Kovic, who became a leading anti-war activist after he returned 
from Vietnam, challenging Dornan, a conservative known for his colorful 
rhetoric, had attracted nationwide interest. 
But on Tuesday, Kovic told associates he had decided not to run. At the time, 
however, Kovic refused to confirm that for reporters.
