NATION; 
JUSTICE DEPT. ASKS PIERCE PROBER TO EXPAND HIS INVESTIGATION 
The Justice Department today asked the independent counsel investigating former 
Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. to expand his investigation after fresh 
allegations of political favoritism at the agency. 
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh made the request in a May 25 letter to independent 
counsel Arlin M. Adams. 
A copy of the letter was released today by the Justice Department after it was 
received by Adams. 
In his letter, Thornburgh asked the court-appointed independent counsel to 
review allegations of favoritism in the operation of the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development's Urban Development Action Grant Program and the 
Secretary's Discretionary Fund for technical assistance and special projects. 
The request was based on a review of testimony recently given to a House 
subcommittee by DuBois Gilliam, former deputy assistant HUD secretary for 
program policy development and evaluation. 
Adams was appointed by a special court earlier this year to investigate 
allegations that Pierce and top aides defrauded the government by awarding 
grants on the basis of political favoritism between 1984 and 1988. 
Democrats in Congress have repeatedly asked Thornburgh to expand the scope of 
Adams' jurisdiction.
