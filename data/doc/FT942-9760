FT  13 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Cocoa futures attract investment
fund buying - Market Report
London COCOA and COFFEE futures put in good performances in the afternoon.
The July robusta coffee contract had sunk to Dollars 1,852 a tonne in the
morning. But a reasonably steady New York gave London support and prices
advanced, the second month closing just Dollars 15 down on balance at
Dollars 1,890.
Cocoa was continuing to benefit from a resurgence in interest in commodities
generally, analysts said, attracting new investment fund buying. The July
position was pushed to a high of Pounds 959 a tonne before the market backed
off slightly to end Pounds 33 up at Pounds 954.
London Metal Exchange COPPER prices settled back late in the afternoon,
having earlier reached new highs for the current move, as yet another
technical reaction set in.
