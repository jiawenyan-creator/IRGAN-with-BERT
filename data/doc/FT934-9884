FT  09 NOV 93 / Crackdown on Kikuyu tribe
Kenya police have arrested several leading members of the majority Kikuyu
tribe in what seems a vendetta spurred by President arap Moi's government,
Leslie Crawford reports from Nairobi. The president, who leads a coalition
of minority ethnic groups, has ordered a crackdown on instigators of ethnic
clashes. Police apparently see this as an order to detain Kikuyus.
