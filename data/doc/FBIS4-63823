<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Mineyev of ITAR-TASS: "Pavel Grachev </F>
at NATO Headquarters"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The visit to Brussels by Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev which began yesterday goes beyond 
the framework of "protocol" visits at this level. The meetings 
with the Russian minister are above all expected to provide 
clarification of the prospects for developing relations between 
Russia and NATO and consequently of the blueprint for a future 
European security system. 
  Everyone in NATO agrees that a nuclear power with a huge 
economic and military potential must play a special role in the 
international security system. But NATO does not want to 
formally enshrine this in the framework document of a program 
which has already been signed by 18 countries, including eight 
former USSR republics, in addition to the alliance members. The 
framework document, NATO leaders say, is a kind of "protocol of 
intent" which entails no commitments. It is proposed to 
cooperate under an individual program, that is to say on a 
bilateral basis. This is where Russia's special status will be 
established. But if Russia does not join the program it will 
find it hard to influence the creation and operation of this 
mechanism.
