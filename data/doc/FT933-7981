FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Quicks ahead despite patchy sales
QUICKS, the Manchester-based motor distributor which returned to the black
last year, continued its recovery with a 24 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
for the first half of 1993.
They came to Pounds 1.38m, against Pounds 1.11m. Profits for the whole of
1992 were Pounds 2.06m following losses of Pounds 952,000 previously.
Mr Alec Murray, chief executive, said that car sales for the first half had
been fairly patchy. Margins were down and its was difficult to make money on
new cars.
But sales for August, the trade's busiest month, were running 10 per cent
ahead of his expectations so far. The second half would be 'far better than
the 1992 second half, which was nothing short of disastrous.'
Mr Murray expected used car sales to be 20 per cent ahead year on year,
while the after sales business, which accounted for 75 per cent of profits,
was doing well.
The overall market for commercial vehicles remained sluggish, but the
trading position of the Iveco Ford and Leyland Daf dealerships was
encouraging.
Midland dealerships again improved their profit performances. The group had
been awarded its first Japanese franchises.
Turnover fell from Pounds 99.4m to Pounds 98.5m. Last month the group bought
Laidlaw for Pounds 8.15m; it has five Ford dealerships in Scotland, Kent and
Essex and was expected to increase group turnover by 50 per cent.
Earnings per share were increased to 5.2p (4.4p) and the interim dividend is
2p (1.75p).
Analysts suggested yesterday that the group had suffered from its
traditional over-dependence on Ford, which had lost market share . But
management had introduced cost controls and rigorous management systems, and
the purchase of Laidlaw fitted in well with the existing business. One
described the company as 'conservative, well-managed, but not particularly
exciting,' with a share price still reasonably cheap compared with others in
the sector.
