OUTTAKES: DOG DAYS FOR MIKE 
Remember Mike the Dog of "Down and Out in Beverly Hills" fame? He just flew 
from L.A. to Toronto first class on Air Canada to shoot a commercial for 
Nestle's Grand Gourmet dog food. Total cost of the round-trip for Mike, two 
trainers and his furry stand-in: $12,780, plus tax! 
According to a source involved in arranging Mike's trip, the airline industry 
is nervous over Zsa Zsa Gabor's current $10-million dog-related legal snarl 
with Delta Airlines (in January, she was asked to leave a Delta jet because she 
wouldn't put her two small dogs in cages, and she's filed a lawsuit). 
Regulations ordinarily prohibit a dog Mike's size from traveling in the 
passenger section, airline sources told us, and special dispensation in such 
cases is becoming less common. 
Someone suggested stashing Mike in cargo, but trainer Clint Rowe wouldn't allow 
it ("Mike's too old (11) and too special for that"). 
So to fly Mike, who returns today, Canada's MacLaren Lintas advertising firm 
had to book the entire first-class cabin, both ways. 
As for Mike's career, he's also just wrapped two international Coke 
commercials. But filmwise, it's a sad tail. 
"Everything I did with him after the movie was a disappointment," Rowe 
admitted. "The ('Down and Out in Beverly Hills' TV) series was a bomb. A pilot 
we did called 'Mutts' was a bomb. . . ." 
Rowe said he now has a completed script and pending deal for Mike. 
The flop-eared canine, however, faces new competition: Rowe is currently 
handling Beasley, a French mastiff, on Touchstone's Tom Hanks starrer, "Turner 
and Hooch" (as well as Beasley's stunt double, Igor). Beasley portrays the 
title pooch named Hooch, "a big, bad junkyard dog who's disgusting, dirty and 
mean and gradually becomes friends with Tom (who plays Turner)." 
But Mike remains Rowe's top dog: "He's my real dream, my shining star." Stacy
