Tuleyev's Supporters Win"] 
  [Text] Siberia is one of the last Russian regions to sum 
up the results of the March elections to organs of 
representative power. According to the electoral commission's 
data, 30 deputies out of 35 hopefuls were elected to the 
Kuzbass' oblast representative organ of power, the legislative 
assembly. An unprecedentedly low voter turnout was noted -- 
approximately one-third of registered voters went to the polls. 
  Approximately two-thirds of seats in the legislative 
assembly 
were won by supporters of Aman Tuleyev, former chairman of 
Kemerovo Oblast Soviet, who is vigorously campaigning for a 
revision of the course of economic reforms being taken by the 
Russian Government.
