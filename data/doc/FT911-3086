FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Nthn Telecom sells STC arm
Northern Telecom, the Canadian telephone equipment maker, has sold the
electrical equipment distribution arm of STC, its recently-acquired UK
subsidiary, to CDME, the French electrical wholesaling company.
Consideration for the sale, which is the result of an auction, is not being
disclosed.
Mr Alain Viry, a director of CDME, said the purchase marked the company's
first inroad into the UK and would give it, at a stroke, about 10 per cent
of that electrical equipment wholesaling market.
There has been speculation that Northern Telecom would sell the business
ever since it acquired STC in an agreed Pounds 1.9bn deal last November.
