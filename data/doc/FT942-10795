FT  09 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: VAT answer to late payers
Sir, One aspect to the late payment of bills which seems to have received
little attention is the effect of VAT.
Large companies remit to Customs &amp; Excise each month the difference between
the VAT which they have charged (output tax) and that which they have been
charged (input tax). If they get paid before they pay their suppliers (for
example, retailers), Customs &amp; Excise tops up the benefit to their cash-flow
by crediting them with the VAT on invoices which they have not in fact paid.
This suggests a simple lever which the chancellor of the exchequer could use
to encourage prompt payment of bills: if a company regularly fails to pay
its bills within 30 days it should be switched to a more onerous VAT regime.
Output tax would still be due to Customs &amp; Excise based on tax point but
input tax could only be claimed in respect of bills actually paid.
