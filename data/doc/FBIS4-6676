  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 19 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- In his 
speech over the national television of 16 April the Prime 
Minister P. Jasray has stated the government's stands on 
organized by the Presidium of the Mongolian Democratic 
Association meetings held at the unsanctioned place the D. 
Suhbaatar Square, demands for resignation of the government and 
hunger strike. [sentence as received] 
  The settling down the issue on the resignation of the 
government, granting it a vote of confidence or nonconfidence 
are pertaining in pursuance with the Constitution of Mongolia to 
the prerogative of the Great State Hural. 
  The government regards that there is no reasons to pose the 
question on the self dismissal of the government on its own 
initiative because it is taking all the possible measures for 
the implementation of a programme of its action considering that 
it is quite possible to be fulfilled within its term of office. 
  In reference to the slander addressing himself he has 
referred to the court which probably will establish the truth 
and make it public. 
  The diversity of opinions is quite natural under the 
conditions of a democratic society. 
  However they should be solved not via meetings ultimatum 
ways 
but within the frameworks of the parliament on the basis of 
allround consideration weighing all those different opinions. 
So I think that the organizers of those meetings and hunger 
strikes ought to have a sense to stop their actions, P. Jasray 
said. 
  The prime minister called upon the people to observe 
strictly 
the law, display a sense and security and concentrate their 
forces and attention on the present day's hard economic 
situation of the country. 
  The organizers of those actions, the prime minister said, 
should to bear responsibility for all the adverse aftermath of 
arranging the meetings at the unsanctioned place and announcing 
the hunger strike.
