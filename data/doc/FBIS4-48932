<F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "$4.8b State Treasury Bonds Sold"] </F>
  [Text] More than 41.6 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) of this 
year's State treasury bonds were sold across China by Wednesday 
[27 April], a leading State Council official said yesterday. 
  The figure accounted for 47 percent of the sales target of 
87 
billion yuan ($10 billion) set for the year. The bonds went on 
sale this month. 
  Nevertheless, State Council Secretary General Luo Gan urged 
financial officials to push the sales drive harder to meet this 
year's target well ahead of schedule. 
  Luo Gan, who is also a State Councillor, stated in a 
tele-conference that fulfilling this year's target is of vital 
importance to the country's economic development. 
  "The issuing plan of treasury bonds must be completed on 
schedule in order to maintain the sustained, rapid and sound 
growth of the national economy," Luo said. 
  It is also important for maintaining political stability and 
promoting social progress, the conferees were told. 
  Each province and city must appoint a high-level official to 
guide the bond issues. 
  Luo urged different local governmental departments to 
continue promoting bond sales and local banks to help bond 
buyers. 
  Luo's comments were echoed by Vice-Finance Minister Xiang 
Huaicheng and Vice-President of People's Bank of China Dai 
Xianglong. 
  Chinese people have shown great interest in buying bonds 
because of their high interest rates.
