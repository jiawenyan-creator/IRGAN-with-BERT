ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH 
FITNESS: Orange County children aren't just out of shape (A1). . . . According 
to the UCI researchers who tested Irvine fourth-graders this year, a third have 
more cholesterol in their blood than is safe, and 8% have levels so high they 
exceed adult safety guidelines. Since cholesterol levels usually rise in 
adulthood, the doctors say, many of these children are in for high heart-attack 
risk unless their diets are changed soon. . . . In New Orleans, meanwhile, the 
nation's top heart organizations Tuesday denounced the "myth" that the 
cholesterol scare has been overblown, reiterating that Americans should cut 
down on saturated fat and cholesterol to minimize the risk of heart disease.
