 

Columbia proposes to construct and operate the facilities for the delivery of gas to Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. (COH)
and Mountaineer Gas Company (Mountaineer), Columbia's existing customers, in order for COH to serve one residential
customer and for Mountaineer to serve 12 residential customers. Columbia states that each of the 13 delivery points
would be used for the delivery of 1.5 dt equivalent of gas per day and 150 dt equivalent on an annual basis. It is asserted
that these volumes would be within COH's and Mountaineer's existing peak day and annual entitlements from Columbia.
Columbia estimates the cost of installing the facilities at $150 apiece. It is stated that the delivery points would
be used for the delivery of gas transported on a firm basis under Columbia's Part 284 blanket certificate, issued in
Docket No. CP86240000.
