FT  05 SEP 92 / Q&amp;A, Briefcase: A friend in distress
A friend in his early 40s has been in the popular music business for many
years. He is married with a large family and supplements his musician's
income through casual construction-related work.
Some years ago a terrible tragedy struck my friend when his toddler was
permanently handicapped after being knocked down on the road. Legal
proceedings regarding the accident are ongoing and I gather that the
youngster is likely to benefit from a compensation award at some point.
From remarks that my friend has made I suspect that he is concerned about
the prospect of his financial circumstances coming under scrutiny as part
of, or subsequent to, the legal aftermath of his child's accident.
This is because my friend has not made any returns to the Inland Revenue for
some years, and I suspect he may never have declared any of his music
business income over his whole career. My friend seems keen to legitimise
his position but does not know the best way to proceed.
The best solution is probably for your friend to explain the position to the
solicitor who is acting for his child. If the solicitor cannot assist him,
he or she will at least be able to put him in touch with a local accountant
who is experienced in that type of negotiation. It is best to have
professional representation when admitting past omissions to the Inland
Revenue - not least because some tax inspectors may adopt a slightly
bullying attitude towards unaided taxpayers.
