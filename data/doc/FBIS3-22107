  [Text] A government source disclosed on 5 February that, 
in connection with the issue of Russian dumping of radioactive 
wastes in the Sea of Japan, the government has firmed its plan 
to provide financial support to Russia for a project to build 
new simplified on-land disposal facilities. The government 
plans to send a fact- finding mission to Russia shortly to work 
out details. 
  Hoping to prevent further dumping of nuclear wastes at sea, 
the government had originally proposed to Russia that it would 
supply a Panamanian-registered chemical tanker (with 
displacement of 6,800 tons). 
  However, Russia rejected the offer in mid-January, pointing 
out that "the tanker cannot operate in frozen waters because the 
outer walls of its hull are too thin." Instead, Russia has 
indicated its intention to tentatively store radioactive wastes 
in its own tanker built exclusively for this purpose. In 
addition, it has revealed a plan to construct simplified 
disposal facilities for handling liquid radioactive wastes in 
Vladivostok and has asked Japan to provide financial support for 
this project. 
  In this connection, the Japanese Government, after careful 
review, has decided to extend several hundred million yen in 
financial assistance to help fund construction of a filtering 
device which is to become the core of the disposal facilities. 
The government plans to allocate funds for the project from a 
$100- million fund designated for dismantling nuclear weapons 
possessed by former Soviet states.
