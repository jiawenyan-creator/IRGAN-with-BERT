FT  18 APR 91 / Pension funds press for action on sex equality
EIGHTEEN of Britain's biggest pension funds have called for the government
to take urgent action on equal treatment of the sexes. That follows last
year's Barber judgment in the European Court, which said men and women must
receive the same pension benefits, and a recent industrial tribunal ruling
that implied heavy extra costs for pension funds.
In a letter to Mr Tony Newton, social security secretary, ICI's pensions
chief Mr Michael Swift, for the 18, says the government must:
equalise state scheme pension ages, with which so many occupational schemes
are linked, and legislate to help schemes to implement equal rights without
being challenged by losers;
amend the existing guaranteed minimum pension rules for occupational schemes
contracted out from the state earnings-related pension scheme, to remove
inequalities;
delay any imposition of limited price indexation of benefits, as in the
Social Securities Act, 1990, but not yet implemented, until schemes'
liabilities in implementing equal treatment are clear;
change Inland Revenue rules on equality of treatment and on scheme
surpluses.
The signatories include the Post Office and many of Britain's leading
companies, including the big four clearing banks, British Telecom, British
Gas and Hanson group.
Mr Swift says government and industry must agree a programme for action so
that pension schemes can comply with article 119 of the Treaty of Rome,
which requires equal treatment of the sexes.
