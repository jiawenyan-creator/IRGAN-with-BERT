FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hewitt shares drop 18p after profits
warning
A warning yesterday from Hewitt Group that profits for 1993 would be below
market expectations prompted an 18p fall in the share price to 185p.
Directors said the maker of industrial ceramics and refractories had
incurred a 'small profit' before tax for the year, including an exceptional
gain of some Pounds 280,000 from the sale of a quoted investment.
Two factors were blamed for the setback - pre-tax profits for 1992 amounted
to Pounds 832,000.
Second half sales at the German operation were below expectations due to a
delay in a contractor completing an essential capital investment project;
and year on year sales of storage heater blocks were lower, reflecting a
lack of new property development.
Although a 'significant uplift' in demand for blocks, particularly by German
customers, had been experienced in the last two months of 1993, it had come
too late to compensate for lower activity during the second and third
quarters.
Year-end gearing was about 80 per cent with a third of net borrowings short
term. At midway, gearing stood at 64 per cent. It was expected to fall in
the second half.
The directors said the outlook for 1994 was 'encouraging, with strong order
books'.
It was their intention to maintain the final dividend at 1.75p for a 3.25p
(3p) total.
