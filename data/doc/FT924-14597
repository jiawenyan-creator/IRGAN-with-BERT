FT  09 OCT 92 / Japan dismisses Kuriles proposal
THE Japanese government yesterday responded sharply to a suggestion by
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia that two of four disputed islands could be
handed back to Japan under a 1956 agreement.
Mr Koichi Kato, chief cabinet secretary, said the Russian leader did not
fully understand the Japanese position.
Mr Yeltsin's comments came at a Moscow news conference shown on Japanese
television. He said he might reschedule his planned visit to Tokyo, which he
cancelled abruptly in September, if the Japanese accepted the return of
Shikotan and Habomai, the smallest of the four islands occupied by Soviet
troops at the end of the second world war.
Japan says it will not conclude a peace treaty with Russia or provide
substantial economic assistance unless Moscow recognises Japanese
sovereignty over the four islands, which it calls the Northern Territories.
'Our position is that we will be flexible if Russia recognises Japan's
sovereignty over the four islands,' Mr Kato said.
