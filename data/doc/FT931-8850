FT  17 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Meff cuts fees to compete
with Liffe contracts
THE BOARD of Meff, the Spanish Financial Futures and Options Exchange in
Barcelona, yesterday announced plans to cut fees and extend trading hours on
its Spanish government bond futures contracts.
Trading in three-year and 10-year bond futures on Meff will be extended by
more than an hour each day, and fees reduced to a fixed level of Pta75 (63
cents) per contract side - a 70 per cent reduction from average 1992 levels.
The move comes in response to a decision by the London International
Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) to launch a 10-year Spanish
government bond future next month, in competition with Meff. Mr Jose Luis
Oller, Meff's chief executive, responded fiercely to Liffe's plans, when
they were announced earlier this month, saying that the rival contract would
split liquidity and segment the market.
