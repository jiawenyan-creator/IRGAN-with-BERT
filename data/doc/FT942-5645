FT  03 JUN 94 / Observer: Bucking the bangs
Why is it taking Britain's Ministry of Defence such a long time to find a
new chief arms dealer? Sir Alan Thomas, current head of the Defence Export
Sales Organisation, steps down at the end of June. But a replacement has yet
to be announced - even though the MoD advertised the job last September.
On offer is plenty of overseas travel, hobnobbing with heads of state, and
(normally) a knighthood - it helps impress overseas clients.
Admittedly, it also sometimes involves rubbing shoulders with types who
might not get into your club. But these days it's a chance to run one of
Britain's great success stories; the UK is now the world's number three arms
seller.
It seems the MoD had little luck with headhunters, and has now fallen back
on the old boy network. The word is that a distinguished naval officer
declined the honour, and the idea of the MoD promoting one of its most
senior civilians appears to have been dismissed.
Still, Observer understands that the search is now drawing to a close.
Subject to cabinet approval, Britain's new top salesman will be a marketing
chap with a background in blue-chip companies closely associated with the
government.
