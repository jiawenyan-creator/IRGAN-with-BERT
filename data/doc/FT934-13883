FT  20 OCT 93 / Russian parties warned to co-operate
A SENIOR official in President Boris Yeltsin's administration yesterday
warned Russia's pro-reform parties they should co-operate over the December
12 elections or be denounced as being unwilling to do so 'for the good of
Russia'.
Mr Vyacheslav Volkov, deputy head of the president's administration, said
Russia's Choice, set up at the weekend by supporters of Mr Yeltsin and a
number of anti-Communist parties, would convene leaders of all similar
groups two weeks before the elections. Politicians who rejected an agreement
'not to get in each other's way and not shoot arrows at each other' would be
publicly denounced.
This ultimatum will further fuel discontent about heavy-handedness and
bullying from the president's supporters.
Mr Konstantin Borovoi, head of the liberal Economic Freedom party, who has
refused to join Russia's Choice, even though he shares its economic
platform, rejected 'co-operation proposed in the form of blackmail. . . if
they continue this way we will boycott the elections.'
