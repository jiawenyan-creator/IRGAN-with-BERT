FT  01 FEB 94 / Investors' interest wanes in Portugal
Direct foreign investment in Portugal fell by 43 per cent to Es112bn (Pounds
427m) in the first seven months of last year, compared with the same period
the 1992, according to the central bank.
Total foreign investment over the period was Es202bn but disinvestment rose
to Es90bn. The financial and real estate sectors attracted 52 per cent of
the total. Only 24 per cent went into manufacturing.
Portuguese authorities say they do not fear growing competition from eastern
and central Europe for inward investment because Portugal offers the bonus
of European Union membership.
But the figures appear to indicate that some potential industrial investors
are finding eastern Europe's lower wages and closer proximity to large
markets more attractive.
New corporate capital accounted for Es12bn of the total amount invested,
capital increases for Es76bn and investment in securities for Es43bn.
