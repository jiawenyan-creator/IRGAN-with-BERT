  [Text] Attention: The Constitutional Court changed part 
of the Electoral Law this evening, 23 March. This organization 
changed the date for the presidential and vice presidential 
election from 8 May to 29 May. Should there be a runoff 
election -- that is, between the two candidates who garner the 
most votes -- the definitive election of President Cesar 
Gaviria's successor will be on 19 June. Other articles of the 
Electoral Law were also changed.
