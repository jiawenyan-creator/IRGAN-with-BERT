NADINE HENLEY; EXECUTIVE AT HUGHES' SUMMA CORP. 
Nadine Henley, top executive and confidante of the late billionaire Howard 
Hughes for almost four decades, has died. She was 83. 
Miss Henley died Friday in her Las Vegas home after suffering a stroke last 
week and developing pneumonia. 
As senior vice president and director of Summa Corp., Hughes' umbrella company 
for all his holdings, she was one of the top three people who ran the Hughes 
financial empire during his final reclusive years and immediately after his 
death in 1976. 
Miss Henley began her career with Hughes in 1940, when she moved to California 
and worked in the engineering department of Hughes Aircraft. 
She became Hughes' private secretary in 1943, and developed into his trusted 
aide and confidante. 
When Hughes moved to Las Vegas in the late 1960s to build his land and gaming 
empire, Miss Henley remained in Los Angeles to oversee his business interests. 
She moved to Las Vegas the year Hughes died. 
The only woman to serve on Hughes' board, Miss Henley retired in 1979 and moved 
briefly to Coronado. She returned to Las Vegas in 1981 after suffering a 
debilitating stroke. 
During her years of working for Hughes and after his death, Miss Henley 
maintained the strict silence about Hughes that he demanded of his top aides. 
She always declined offers to write a book or discuss his personal life, which 
could have made her a fortune. 
Born Nov. 8, 1906, in Bloomington, Ind., Miss Henley first worked for a bank 
and then for Lehman Brothers in Chicago. In 1936, she became one of the first 
women to trade stock on the stock exchange floor. 
Miss Henley's fifth husband died in March. She had no children and left no 
immediate survivors.
