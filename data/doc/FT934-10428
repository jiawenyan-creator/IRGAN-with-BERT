FT  05 NOV 93 / Arts: Today's Television
This season, Friday is looking like one of the best nights for going out.
The early evening is dominated by the sort of aged series to which
broadcasters like to attach the word 'cult'. BBC2 cranks out the old puppet
drama Captain Scarlet And The Mysterons (6.00) promptly followed by the spy
series of similar vintage, The Man From UNCLE (6.25). That clashes with the
frequently shown Happy Days which led the fifties-revival in the 1970s (C4,
6.30). BBC1 is repeating Doctor Who: Planet of the Daleks (7.30) presumably
for a new generation who haven't seen it before.
It is hard to believe that The Wartime Kitchen And Garden (BBC2, 8.30) will
be able to match the charm and fascination of 'A Victorian Kitchen Garden',
but we shall see. Harry Dodson re-creates the sort of gardening that was
inspired by the slogan 'Dig For Victory' and Ruth Mott goes into the kitchen
to recall the glories of snoek, powdered eggs (jolly good for making
fried-eggy-bread) and carrot cake
The ITV drama series Demob (9.00) is mildly entertaining - but this is
bonfire night, forget television.
