SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background 


U.S. Highway 191 passes through the northwest corner of Yellowstone National Park for approximately twenty-two
miles. It is a federally funded highway and is maintained within Yellowstone by the State of Montana under the provisions
of a Special Use Permit issued by the National Park Service (Yellowstone National Park). 
The wagon road which eventually became U.S. Highway 191 was constructed through Yellowstone in 1910 with the approval
of the Secretary of the Interior at the sole expense of Gallatin County, Montana. The road was constructed ``to facilitate
travel and commerce'' between residents in the southern portion of Gallatin County and the county seat located in
Bozeman, Montana. From its inception, the purpose, historical use, and management of U.S. Highway 191 indicate that
the highway was constructed, regulated, and maintained as a connecting route between Bozeman and West Yellowstone,
Montana, for the principal purposes of commerce and convenience and only incidentally for access to Yellowstone
National Park. 
The early differentiation of this route from other park roads was articulated in the Superintendent's Annual Report
for 1913 and 1914, which stated in part: 



This is the only road in the park on which motor propelled vehicles are allowed and it is not a part of the regular tourist
route. 



The ongoing intent to exempt U.S. Highway 191 from the general regulations related to commercial vehicles which govern
other park roads is indicated in 36 CFR 5.4 (1993), which reads as follows: 



Sec. 5.4Commercial passenger-carrying motor vehicles. 


(a) The commercial transportation of passengers by motor vehicles except as authorized under a contract or permit
from the Secretary or his authorized representative is prohibited in *** Yellowstone (prohibition
does not apply to non-scheduled tours as defined in Section 7.13 of this chapter, nor to that portion of U.S. Highway
191 traversing the northwest corner of the park) ***




Although use of U.S. Highway 191 has since expanded to include interstate travel, local commercial and non-commercial
traffic remains the predominant use of the highway. 
In response to public interest in the management and regulation of commercial traffic on U.S. Highway 191 within Yellowstone
National Park, the park conducted a series of three public meetings in 1987 and completed two environmental assessments
(1990 and 1992) to evaluate the potential impacts of commercial traffic on natural and cultural resources and on visitor
safety and experience. 
Among the concerns identified during this process was the potential for a hazardous material spill from a commercial
vehicle accident to cause irreparable damage to riverine areas adjacent to the road; and the potential social and
economic impacts of redirecting some or all of the commercial vehicle traffic to alternative routes.
