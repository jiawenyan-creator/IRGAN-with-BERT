FT  20 MAY 94 / Retail sales reach record in April despite tax rises
The volume of retail sales reached record levels last month as consumers
took advantage of competitive pricing and carried on spending in spite of
the effect of tax increases.
April's seasonally adjusted retail sales were the highest since records
began in the 1950s.
The figures were 0.4 per cent higher than those for March and and 4.4 per
cent up on April last year, the Central Statistical Office announced
yesterday.
Sales values rose at a slower rate. The weekly value of retail sales was 2.8
per cent higher than last April.
The growth was seen in almost all sectors, showing the strength of this
underlying upward trend.
Food, non-food and mixed retailers all reported record volumes.
The strongest rise was in the food retailers sector. Sales were up 1.5 per
cent in the three months to April compared to the November-January figures.
Non-food retailers saw a more moderate rise of 0.7 per cent, but there was
divergence between sectors.
Some of the best results were recorded in areas with sharpest price
competition - suggesting that consumers remain highly price-sensitive.
Footwear and clothing, where price competition has been fierce, rose by 1.9
per cent in the three months to April, compared with the November-January
period - the highest growth of any sector.
Only the household goods sector saw a fall in volumes during April. Sales
were 0.9 per cent down on the previous month.
Some analysts suggested yesterday that this may point to a slightly slower
rate of house purchases.
This was disputed by the British Retail Consortium, which said that
furniture and carpets had performed well within the household goods sector
because of a more encouraging market.
Household goods were 0.5 per cent up on the previous three months and 5.8
per cent up on the same period a year ago - the highest yearly growth of any
sector.
This was a reflection of the volatile nature of the sectors.
