  [Text] In Jammu and Kashmir, the militancy has declined 
after the Hazratbal [shrine] crisis. This was stated by the 
general officer commanding in chief of the Northern Command, 
Lieutenant General Surendra Singh, while addressing a press 
conference at Udhampur yesterday. He said the militants are 
feeling demoralized. Infighting among the militant groups is 
also a cause of their frustration. The general said the 
situation in the state is under control. He, however, did not 
rule out sporadic incidents of violence or killings by the 
militants to create tension. He said the so-called strongholds 
of militants, like Sopor and some other parts in the valley, 
have been cleared and the people are now heaving a sigh of 
relief.
