'VIDEOS' AND DANGER 
Concerning columnist Howard Rosenberg's criticism of "America's Funniest Home 
Videos" as a danger to children (March 24 and April 9): 
As a research assistant in epidemiology at UCLA I've been involved with a study 
on mild brain injuries in children. For nearly a year I visited emergency rooms 
looking for such cases, typically resulting from play activities -- the stuff 
of "funny home videos." 
I wouldn't be surprised if many of the children in the clips shown on TV ended 
up in an emergency room with the symptoms of a mild brain injury or concussion. 
I know because I've reviewed hundreds of ER charts. 
Rosenberg did well to point out that each clip ends at the point of impact. 
What happens afterward?
