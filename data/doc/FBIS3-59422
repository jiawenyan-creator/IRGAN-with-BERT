  [Text] Skopje (TANJUG) -- The new president of the Serbian 
Democratic Party (DPS) in Macedonia, Dragisa Miletic, has 
dismissed suggestions that his party might become radical and 
serve as a vehicle of Serbia's influence on the Serbian 
community in this former Yugoslav republic. 
  In an interview for Skopje "AI" Television Miletic pointed 
out that the government of the new state cannot offer any 
justification for excluding Serbs from the new constitution. 
  Miletic stressed that his party had submitted an amendment 
to 
the Macedonian Constitution demanding that Serbs be recognized 
in the Constitution and that the DPS be given two seats in the 
republic's council for interethnic relations because the same 
opportunity was given to other nationalities and religious 
communities. 
  Miletic noted there is only one way for Serbs to perceive 
their exclusion from the Constitution: as a "negation of their 
centuries-long existence in these territories" and an attempt to 
subject this community to the process of assimilation. 
  The DPS president explicitly pointed out that his party will 
not get involved in church issues the way the previous party 
leadership did. In his opinion the current church issues should 
be resolved by the Serbian Orthodox Church and Macedonian 
church. 
  Miletic stated that the DPS will refer to the new state as 
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia until it is recognized 
by the international community and by the FRY [Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia] and until it is given a permanent name. 
  After each answer given by the DPS president, "AI" 
Television 
introduced comments by his predecessor Ristic, who noted, among 
other things, that a part of the new leadership consists of the 
supporters of Vojislav Sesel's Serbian Radical Party [SRS].
