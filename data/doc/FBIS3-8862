  [Text] Bratislava, March 16 (CTK) -- The new Slovak 
Foreign Minister and Slovak UN representative Eduard Kukan said 
today that he was "partially surprised" by his appointment. 
  "Here in the USA we have been following in detail the 
development of events in Slovakia. However, it was only when I 
read the recent speech by the premier-designate, former Foreign 
Minister Josef Moravcik, to the effect that his successor in the 
ministerial seat should be a professional diplomat, that I 
started to think that he might mean me," Kukan said in a 
telephone interview for Bratislava radio from New York. 
  With regard to his successor in New York, Kukan said he 
favored "a person with sufficient experience" in the foreign 
service. "It is multilateral diplomacy, and experience and 
practice are essential prerequisites," he added. 
  As a Czechoslovak and later Slovak diplomat, Kukan was 
thought highly of for his expert abilities, and CTK sources put 
him in first place during speculations on the new cabinet for 
both these abilities and his closeness to Moravcik. It is 
expected that his activity as Foreign Minister will carry on 
directly from the policy of his predecessor which was generally 
considered pragmatic and pro-Western.
