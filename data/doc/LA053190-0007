DIFFERING VIEWS OF DAY-CARE DILEMMA 
It was enlightening to find that 68% of pediatricians think it's detrimental 
for a baby under the age of 6 months to be cared for by day care. 
Even ducks spend more than the two-week maternity leave many human mothers feel 
is adequate for bonding. 
Our economy and values are so screwed up, we ignore the needs of babies. There 
should be a new charity, "Whaaaa! I want my mommy!" Mothers who want to stay 
home with their babies could go to this fund to pay them to stay with their 
newborns. The best day care is do-it-yourself. Are you listening, legislators?
