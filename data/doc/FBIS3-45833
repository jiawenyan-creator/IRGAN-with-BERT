  [Text] Hefei, January 20 (XINHUA) -- East China's Anhui 
Province has made rapid progress in economic development in the 
past year. 
  According to statistics, the gross domestic product amounted 
to 93 billion yuan-worth last year, an increase of 23 percent 
over the previous year. 
  A provincial official attributed the good result to 
deepening 
the reform of the enterprise mechanism. 
  According to the official, 340 state businesses in the red 
were merged with or sold to more efficient enterprises, or went 
bankrupt last year, and 377 state enterprises tried out the 
share-holding system. 
  Rural industrial enterprises generated output value 
totalling 
110 billion yuan last year, an increase of 92 percent over the 
previous year. 
  Now 30 percent of farmers' income comes from rural 
industries. 
  Thanks to the overall opening policy, Anhui's imports and 
exports went up by 25.7 percent last year over the previous 
year. Exports topped one billion U.S. dollars-worth. 
  Anhui approved the setting up of a record over 1,000 
foreign- 
funded enterprises involving 600 million U.S. dollars of direct 
foreign investment last year. 
  To make full use of its rich natural resources, the 
provincial government has decided to spend 100 billion yuan on 
building nine industrial production centers of steel, coal, 
power, petrochemical, non-ferrous metals and building materials 
in the rest of the 1990s.
