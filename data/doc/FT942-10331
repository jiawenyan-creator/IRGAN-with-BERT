FT  11 MAY 94 / Arts: Today's Television
If track records are anything to go by, today's 'Screen Two' ought to be
worth 70 minutes of anybody's time. Hope In The Year Two is a drama about
Danton, written by Trevor Griffiths (author of Comedians, The Party and so
on) directed by Elijah Moshinsky (Covent Garden producer, director of
several BBC Shakespeare plays and much besides), starring Jack Shepherd as
the French revolutionary, with music by Carl Davis. Danton is in a Paris
gaol, awaiting the guillotine in the morning .. (9.00 BBC2).
Last week's episode in The Lifeboat was like an episode from a soap opera.
No doubt lifeboatmen do lead lives much like the rest of us when they are
ashore: they are unusual because of what they do at sea and, above all,
because of their extraordinary courage. Television, wouldn't you know,
thinks that the really interesting things about lifeboatmen are their
domestic difficulties and their darts matches. What a waste (8.00 BBC1).
Dispatches reports on child labour around the world, claiming that 100
million are forced to work every day (9.00 C4).
