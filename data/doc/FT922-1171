FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: Yue Yuen issue attracts firm
demand
THE STRENGTH of demand for an exposure to the Chinese economy was underlined
yesterday when investors stumped up nearly HKDollars 30bn (USDollars 3.8bn)
in their rush to buy a slice of Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings, a
Taiwanese-controlled manufacturer of sports shoes in southern China.
The Yue Yuen new issue was for 550m shares of HKDollars 1.18 to raise
HKDollars 649m. Last night, the company's advisers, Standard Chartered Asia,
said the issue, for 25 per cent of the company, was 45.39 times
oversubscribed.
The company, which is controlled by Mr Tsai Chi Jen and his brother Mr Tsai
Chi Neng, manufactures Adidas, Nike, and Reebok sports shoes, among others,
at its Dongguan factory, south of Guangzhou (Canton).
It plans to open another factory in the city of Zhongshan, also in Guangdong
province.
The brothers will retain 70 per cent of the company. A further 5 per cent
has been placed privately by Jardine Fleming.
Mr Ambrose Lam, director of corporate finance at Standard Chartered Asia,
said the market was attracted to Yue Yuen because it was a pure China stock.
It was well-managed and achieved high margins.
