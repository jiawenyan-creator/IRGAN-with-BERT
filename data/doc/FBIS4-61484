  [Text] The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
(LDPR), Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, today met the chairman of 
International Swords Into Plowshares, Jeffry M. Ault. 
  A statement by the LDPR parliamentary faction press office 
described the above-mentioned organization as "widely known in 
the U.S.A. and having much clout." The press office also 
referred to Ault as saying that a number of congressmen and 
senators had asked him to meet Zhirinovskiy. 
  The statement quoted Ault as saying: "Not everyone in 
America believes what our newspapers write about you." In his 
opinion, very important events are happening in Russia and 
politicians of other countries have to obtain adequate 
information at first hand. 
  Zhirinovskiy said his position with respect to the U.S.A. 
was 
constantly misrepresented as open anti-Americanism. On the 
contrary, he supports stable and, first of all, fair relations 
between two great powers, according to the press office. 
  Ault offered Zhirinovskiy his help in establishing contacts 
with American politicians and businessmen. 
  Zhirinovskiy asked Ault to tell everyone in the U.S.A. that 
the LDPR had supported peace and never called for war in any 
region of the world, the press office said.
