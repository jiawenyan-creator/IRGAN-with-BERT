MORNING REPORT: STAGE 
Actor Rex Harrison, 81, made it through two acts of W. Somerset Maugham's 1921 
play "The Circle" Wednesday night in Baltimore, but was unable to finish 
because he was suffering pain from dental surgery. The audience was told he was 
unable to continue and an understudy took over. The play is headed for Broadway 
on Nov. 20 with Harrison, Glynis John and Stewart Granger as the stars. ALEENE
