FT  28 APR 92 / Peru bank chief forced to resign
MR Jorge Chavez was yesterday removed by government decree from his post as
president of Peru's central bank, Sally Bowen writes from Lima.
Although his replacement, Mr German Suarez Chavez, is a long-serving central
bank official, local economists fear the change may herald increasing
government pressure on the bank to relax its reins on spending.
Mr Jorge Chavez has resisted several attempts to force his resignation since
President Alberto Fujimori suspended Peru's constitution on April 5 and
formed a de facto government backed by the armed forces. Mr Chavez defended
the bank's constitutional autonomy, saying he would refuse to use the
Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 790m) in accumulated reserves to support
'macro-economic populism'.
The move to oust Mr Chavez, who leaves the bank along with three other
directors, came only days after the ratification of Mr Carlos Bolona as
minister of economy and finance. Disagreements over policy had punctuated
relations between the two men.
