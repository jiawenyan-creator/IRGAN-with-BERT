  [Text] [From the ``African News'' program] 
  The Zambian finance minister, Ronald Penza, has called on 
President Chiluba to address the problem of alleged drug dealing 
within the cabinet. Mr. Penza said the problem was real and was 
becoming so acute that some Western countries were referring to 
Zambia as the Colombia of Africa. President Chiluba says the 
allegations are unfounded. 
  Several members of Parliament in the governing party, the 
Movement for Multiparty Democracy, have resigned in recent 
months, alleging corruption and drug dealing by government 
ministers. A correspondent for the BBC in the Zambian capital, 
Lusaka, says the president could face a fresh wave of 
resignations if he does not move quickly.
