FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Further board change expected at Budgens
MR KEITH Clarke is expected to step down as managing director at Budgens,
the small food retailer whose institutional shareholders last year installed
new management.
Mr Clarke, a former trading and marketing director at Asda Stores, was
brought into Budgens in 1990 by Mr John Fletcher, who became chairman and
chief executive of the group in 1985 after three years as managing director
of Asda.
Last April institutions forced the resignation of Mr Fletcher as chairman,
injected Pounds 21.7m into the loss-making group and appointed Mr John von
Spreckelsen as chief executive.
Last month Mr Derek Pretty resigned as finance director, to be replaced by
Mr Graham Rigby, one of the management troika brought in by the institutions
last April.
Mr von Spreckelsen, Mr Rigby and Mr Christian Williams joined Budgens after
turning round Kafu Wasmund, the Bremen-based supermarket chain.
Budgens recently reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.2m for the six months
to November 28, compared with a restated loss of Pounds 33,000 for the same
period in 1990.
Mr von Spreckelsen described the results as a 'significant first step on the
road to recovery', and said his three-year plan to revitalise the group was
on course.
He last night declined to discuss Mr Clarke's position, saying any changes
in senior management would be announced in an official statement. Mr Clarke
was not available for comment.
