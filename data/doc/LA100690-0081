IF JACK CLARK RETURNS, AT LEAST ONE FAN WON'T 
It seems that most Padre fans automatically, without question, assume that Tony 
Gwynn is being unfairly critized by his teammates. 
They base these assumptions on the fact that he has been an outstanding player 
and has had a high profile in the community. 
I don't pretend to have any first-hand knowledge of the Padre locker-room 
situation, nor do any of the fans who automatically support Tony. I do know 
that the Padre fans were fooled once before. Remember, we were led to believe 
that Steve Garvey was the clean-cut, all-American boy. That image was certainly 
shattered, so let's reserve judgment on the Gwynn or Padre situation.
