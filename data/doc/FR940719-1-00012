(4) In addition to the notice given to importers or consignees of articles released under bond, district directors
shall provide written notice to all owners, importers or consignees of articles which are denied entry into the United
States pursuant to an exclusion order that any future attempt to import such articles may result in the articles being
seized and forfeited. Copies of all such notices are to be forwarded to the Commercial Compliance Branch, Office of
Trade Operations, at Customs Headquarters, and to the Office of The General Counsel, USITC, 500 E Street SW., Washington
DC 20436 by the district directors. 

(c) 

Seizure and Forfeiture Orders.

 (1) In addition to issuing an exclusion order under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Commission may issue an order
providing that any article determined to be in violation of section 337 be seized and forfeited to the United States.
Such order may be issued if: 

(i) The owner, importer, or consignee of the article previously attempted to import the article into the United States;


(ii) The article was previously denied entry into the United States by reason of an exclusion order issued under paragraph
(b)(1) of this section; and 

(iii) Upon such previous denial of entry, the district director of the district in which the entry was attempted had
notified the owner, importer, or consignee of the article in writing of both the exclusion order and that seizure and
forfeiture would result from any further attempt to import the article into the United States. 

(2) Upon receipt of any seizure order issued by the Commission in accordance with this paragraph, the Assistant Commissioner,
Commercial Operations shall immediately notify all ports of entry of the property subject to the seizure order and
identify the persons notified under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. 

(3) The district director in the district in which the article was seized shall issue a notice of seizure to parties
known to have a proprietary interest in the seized property. All claimants to the property shall have an opportunity
to petition for relief under the provisions of 19 CFR part 171. All petitions must be filed within 30 days of the date
of issuance of the notice of seizure, and failure of a claimant to petition will result in the commencement of administrative
forfeiture proceedings. All petitions will be decided by the appropriate Customs officer, based upon the value of
the articles under seizure. 

(4) If seized articles are found to be not includable in an order for seizure and forfeiture, then the seizure and the
forfeiture shall be remitted in accordance with standard Customs procedures. 

(5) Forfeited merchandise shall be disposed of in accordance with the Customs laws.
