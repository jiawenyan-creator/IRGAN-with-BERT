WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA; 
RESIDENTIAL PARKING ZONES 
The City Council on Tuesday sent a message to area businesses: Parking in 
residential zones will not be tolerated. 
In a 5-1 vote, with Councilman Herbert Katz voting no, the council created five 
additional preferential parking zones in neighborhoods where residents had 
complained that businesses were using residential streets for parking of 
customers', employees' and company cars. 
The new zones, on sections of California Avenue, Pine Street, Maple Street, 
29th Street, 21st Street, 22nd Street and Franklin Street, establish times when 
only residents with permits can park.
