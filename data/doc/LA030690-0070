METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN HELD IN THREATS TO STEPHANIE ZIMBALIST 
A Michigan man has been arrested at a Sherman Oaks hotel after sending more 
than 200 threatening letters to actress Stephanie Zimbalist, daughter of Efrem 
Zimbalist Jr. and star of the television series Remington Steele, the FBI said 
Monday. 
Arrested for investigation of mailing threatening communications was Michael 
Lawrence Shields, 43, of Plymouth, Mich. 
Sending such materials through the mail is a violation of federal extortion 
statutes punishable by up to five years in prison and a $1,000 fine, said 
special agent Lawrence G. Lawler. 
Shields was arrested about 6 p.m. Friday at the Valley Hilton Hotel in Sherman 
Oaks, where he was a registered guest. The FBI learned of his whereabouts, 
according to Lawler, after Shields revealed it in a letter to Zimbalist.
