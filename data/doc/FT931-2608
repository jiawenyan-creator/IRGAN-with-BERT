FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Gulf Canada suspends dividends
GULF Canada Resources, the troubled Calgary-based energy company controlled
by Olympia &amp; York Developments, has suspended payment of preferred share
dividends and announced numerous asset sales.
The measures are designed to cut the company's CDollars 1.6bn (USDollars
1.27bn) debt and pave the way for an equity issue. Dividends on common
shares were eliminated last June.
Gulf Canada is 75 per cent owned by O&amp;Y, which last week emerged from
bankruptcy protection.
However, O&amp;Y's Gulf shares are effectively controlled by the creditors to
whom they were pledged. The creditors can take legal title on 30 days'
notice.
Gulf said it hoped to raise CDollars 400m from the sale of its Arctic
drilling business, as well as the planned disposal of some oil and gas
properties in western Canada and its 22.8 per cent interest in Home Oil of
Calgary.
The Home Oil stake has been for sale for more than a year. Mr Chuck Shultz,
Gulf's chief executive, said interest from prospective buyers has increased
in recent months. GW Utilities, another O&amp;Y subsidiary, has a 41 per cent
stake in Home Oil.
The Kulluk drilling unit and two support vessels have been sold to Amoco's
Canadian subsidiary. Terms were not disclosed, but Amoco said that the deal
gave it an opportunity to expand its Arctic fleet at well below replacement
cost.
Gulf suffered a CDollars 302m loss in 1992, about two-thirds of which
consisted of a write-down on its now-terminated investment in the Hibernia
oil project off the coast of Newfoundland. The company abandoned a CDollars
175m share issue last year.
In addition to its Canadian business, Gulf has interests in oil and gas
fields in Indonesia and Russia.
