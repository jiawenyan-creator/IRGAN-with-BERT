FT  23 APR 91 / Observer: Programme trade
While Manchester United seek stock-market flotation, Sheffield Wednesday,
who beat them in Sunday's Rumbelows League Cup final, might turn to the FT
Ordinary index to appreciate just how long it had been since they last won a
Wembley final.
It was 1935, the year the Ordinary was launched. On Sunday, the index (base
100) stood at 1980.1. We are told that the 1935 Wembley programme cost one
old penny. Sunday's cost Pounds 3 - a 720-fold increase.
