FT  06 FEB 92 / Leading Article: No more to say
BRITAIN'S democracy will be healthier when there is no market for stolen
documents relating to the personal lives of leading politicians. That there
is a market, and that the News of the World was apparently regarded by the
thief as a potential buyer, is a sad comment on both the popular press and
the state of mind of some of its readers. In a sane polity the response of
the burglar who found himself in possession of a paper relating to Mr Paddy
Ashdown's brief relationship with a secretary in 1986 would have been bitter
disappointment at having lifted nothing of commercial value.
It may be that the mood of the times is turning against the hypocrisy
inherent in manufacturing 'news' about public figures on the basis of
behaviour which is of solely private significance. If so, the market for
salacious tidbits about persons in the public eye will be diminished. In
France personal liaisons are not deemed to be politically significant; would
that this were so in Britain. Both the prime minister and the leader of the
opposition have tried to guide opinion by stating that this matter has
nothing to do with the Liberal Democrat leader's politics. Quite so.
