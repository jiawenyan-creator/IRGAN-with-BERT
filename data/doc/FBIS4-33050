  [Text] Gustavo Roosen, presidential commissioner for reform 
of the financial system, met with President Rafael Caldera, 
Central Bank President Antonio Casas, Deputy Finance Minister 
Luis Javier Grisanti, and Andres Caldera, minister of the 
Secretariat Presidency, at Miraflores Palace on 28 May. They 
analyzed the aspects of sales of foreign currency in view of the 
dollar's gradual decline in relation to the bolivar. 
  Roosen said the reduction in the price of U.S. currency will 
establish a fair rate of exchange regarding the bolivar, 
according to the developments of the foreign exchange market. 
  Meanwhile, Roosen commented on the subsidies granted by 
Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] to 
certain financial institutions. He warned that if the loaned 
money is not repaid on schedule, namely 7 June, these banks will 
be transferred to state hands. 
  [Begin Roosen recording] We can coordinate theo 
administration of banks' finances in order to cover the 
deficiencies a bank may have at a given time, because we will 
all be shareholders. Banco Latino has a significant cash 
surplus, which has been exchanged for zero-coupon bonds. Banco 
Latino does not have any limitations; on the contrary, it is 
ready to sell these bonds to support its fellow banks owned by 
Fogade. This will permit them to generate--what I have heard so 
many times--[words indistinct] short of financial assistance, as 
part of the financial system without resorting to the 
zero-coupon market. We have been working on this topic this 
week, and the principle of autonomous financial management for 
Fogade is being consolidated, empowering it to supervise and 
take action regarding the banks they will own and supervise.
