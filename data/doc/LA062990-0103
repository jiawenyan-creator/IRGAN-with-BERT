DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $30-MILLION BOND FOR SCHOOLS PUT ON BALLOT 
A bond issue to raise up to $30 million to upgrade and expand schools in the 
Sulphur Springs School District has been placed on the Nov. 6 ballot by 
district trustees. 
Wednesday night, trustees endorsed a bond proposal that would expand existing 
schools to cope with skyrocketing enrollment. 
The district, which serves 3,200 students in Canyon Country, is the first 
school district in the Santa Clarita Valley to put a bond measure before the 
voters this year. Officials from four other school systems in the area are 
considering similar measures. 
The measure, which needs two-thirds approval for passage, would not raise 
existing property tax rates, district Supt. Robert Nolet said. Instead, it 
would merely extend by 25 years a series of earlier district bond measures set 
to expire within five years. 
Nolet compared the effect of the measure to taking out a second mortgage on a 
home. The amount of the monthly payments will not rise, but the payments will 
be spread out over a longer period of time, he said.
