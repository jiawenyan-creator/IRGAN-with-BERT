FT  01 JUN 92 / Gould backs party link with unions
MR BRYAN GOULD, a cand-idate for the Labour leadership, said yesterday that
the party's link with the unions was 'valuable' and would be 'a source of
strength as it has been in the past'.
The link needed to be adjusted, but not broken, he said on BBC television.
'We should certainly not conduct this debate as though the link with the
trade unions is some sort of burden that we have to put up with because it
is inevitable.'
His comments and those of other senior figures in the party and union
movement highlighted the growing demands of those seeking a 'fundamental
overhaul' of the Labour party and the pressures on candidates for the party
leadership to defend its historic traditions.
In an interview on TV-am, Mr Jack Cunningham, the party's campaign
co-ordinator, reiterated his support for the abandonment of the Labour rule
book's Clause 4, which calls for public ownership, and warned that the way
the party conducts its affairs was putting off voters.
His comments appeared tacitly to back a sharply diminished union role as
part of a 'fundamental overhaul' of the party's image.
'For too many people, the Labour party still remains a closed organisation,
an organisation that is difficult to join, very difficult to participate
effectively in,' he said.
His views were echoed by Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU
engineering workers' and electricians' union, who used an article in the
union's newspaper to attack the 'antiquated' links between the party and the
unions.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the favoured candidate of Mr John Smith in the deputy
leadership race, denied on London Weekend Television either that she was
slipping behind or that she was the establishment candidate.
