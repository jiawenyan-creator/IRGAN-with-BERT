FT  05 AUG 93 / Industrial orders fall in west
FIGURES released yesterday by Germany's Federal Statistics Office show west
German industrial orders for June fell by 1.6 per cent compared with the
previous month, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
However, demand for consumer goods rose 1.5 per cent over the same period.
A statement issued by the federal economics ministry said the fall in
industrial orders, greater than economists had expected, was due largely to
a fall in orders for capital goods. These dropped by 3.7 per cent in June
compared with May. Orders for May and June together fell in real terms by
7.3 per cent compared with the same period in 1992.
The fall in foreign orders was only slighty down, by 0.9 per cent, but
economists were concerned about the possible impact the radical changes to
the bands in the Exchange Rate Mechanism would have on German exports over
the next few months.
