<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian UN commander Sir Michael Rose by </F>
unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "We Will Reply 
With the Use of Force"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Have NATO air strikes become 
superfluous as a result of the Serbian compromise? 
  [Rose] I am optimistic that air strikes will not be 
necessary. The cease-fire is largely being observed. The UN 
troops were allowed to position themselves between the front 
lines. We believe that all weapons will be under our control 
before the ultimatum ends. Then a commission will regulate 
details so that life can normalize again in Sarajevo. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does this make the NATO ultimatum superfluous? 
  [Rose] If you draw a line around Sarajevo, there are three 
warring parties. If one of them interrupts the peace process -- 
for whatever reasons -- it risks an air strike. Yet, our main 
task in Bosnia is to supply the civilian population with food. 
This will be very difficult if we drop bombs. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are you serious? Your main task is probably 
to end the siege of Sarajevo and to protect the town against the 
Serbian conquerors. 
  [Rose] Without the blue helmets, numerous people probably 
would have died of starvation. In addition, we have to 
participate in the creation of security zones. NATO will 
support us here. Life in Sarajevo must be normalized, so people 
can live here like in Bonn or Berlin. It must be possible for 
people to leave the town any time. This is what I understand by 
normal life. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is Sarajevo's pacification the beginning of a 
political solution for the other Muslim enclaves? What will 
happen to Mostar, which is encircled by the Croats? 
  [Rose] If the peace process in Sarajevo is successful, 
effects will also be noticeable in other areas. The Muslim 
eastern part of the town is a top priority. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Serbian Army is withdrawing the major part 
of its artillery. The rest will remain under UN control within 
a 20-km radius around Sarajevo. Why? 
  [Rose] I have no idea why they are doing that. The Serbs 
probably consider it important to leave some weapons there. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] To be able to use them quickly during the next 
offensive by the Bosnian Army. 
  [Rose] This may be the reason. Yet, in my view, the UN 
control mechanism works as follows: The side that wants to have 
the weapons back must use force, and we will reply with force. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does this mean that for months NATO will be on 
constant alert concerning Bosnia? 
  [Rose] This may be the case. However, NATO has been present 
in the Bosnian air space since last April. It will remain there 
until the peace process is completed. It does not make any 
difference to the pilots. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Muslim fighters in Sarajevo are urgently 
waiting to take advantage of the situation and to recapture 
positions they have lost. Would you also intervene against the 
Bosnian-Muslim Army? 
  [Rose] We are between the warring parties. Thus, the 
Bosnian Army would have to attack us first. We are entitled to 
defend ourselves. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Every air strike must be requested by you. 
Would it be possible for NATO to strike Serbian positions 
without consulting you? 
  [Rose] Naturally it can happen that NATO combat planes are 
forced to strike back in self-defense if they are attacked from 
the ground. In that case, NATO will not consult anybody. 
However, if NATO attacks ground troops, I will be involved in 
the decisionmaking process because I am the local commander. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The problem is that, after the unsuccessful 
talks of the past few months, nobody really believes the Serbian 
war machinery can be stopped in the long run without air strikes. 
  [Rose] The Serbs promised the fulfillment of all conditions 
mentioned in the Geneva peace plan before the ultimatum was 
adopted. With its threat, the NATO ultimatum efficiently 
supported this process. I am confident: If a get into a car, I 
do not expect it to give up the ghost. If it happens, I will 
react. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] So far the West has rejected the use of force 
vis-a-vis the Serbs, claiming the war might spread to the whole 
Balkans in that case. Do you see this danger? 
  [Rose] I examine every problem separately. Ending the siege 
of Sarajevo is one thing. Of course, other risks continue to 
exist. Yet, my instinct tells me the war will not spread.
