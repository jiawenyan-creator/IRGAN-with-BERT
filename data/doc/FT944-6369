FT  30 NOV 94 / Technical fault halts Eurostar
Eurostar, the high-speed train service which links London with Paris and
Brussels through the Channel tunnel, yesterday suffered its first breakdown
since it began carrying fare-paying passengers.
The 8.23am train from London to Paris developed a technical fault in
northern France and stopped at Haute Picardie station. The 633 passengers
were transferred to another train and arrived in Paris two hours late. They
would receive a refund, French rail authority SNCF said.
A total of 100,000 Eurostar tickets have been sold since sales began four
weeks ago, European Passenger Services, the British partner in the
three-country project, said.
