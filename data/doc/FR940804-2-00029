Case History 



Since the notice of initiation on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 3844, January 26, 1994), the following events have occurred.


On February 14, 1994, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination
(USITC Publication 2734, February 1994). 

On February 25, 1994, we named Roldan, S.A. (Roldan) and Acenor, S.A. (Acenor) as respondents in this investigation
and on February 28, 1994, issued antidumping questionnaires to both companies. These companies represent 100 percent
of U.S. imports of subject merchandise from Spain during the POI. We presented the questionnaire to Roldan at its facility
in Madrid, Spain on March 7, 1994, and to Acenor at its facility in Bilbao, Spain on March 10, 1994. 

We received Roldan's response to Section A of the Department's questionnaire on March 28, 1994. We received Roldan's
responses to Sections B and C of the Department's questionnaire on April 21, 1994. We received Acenor's responses
to Sections A, B, and C of the Department's questionnaire on May 18, 1994. 

On March 25, 1994, we received comments on the issue of class or kind of merchandise from interested parties, per the
Department's invitation of such comments in its notice of initiation. On April 13, 1994, we received rebuttal comments
on this issue. On May 11, 1994, we determined that SSB constitutes one class or kind of merchandise. (See May 11, 1994,
Decision Memorandum to Barbara Stafford from The Team Re: Class or Kind of Merchandise.) 

On May 27, 1994, the Department rescinded the COP investigations against Roldan and Acenor that were initiated on
January 19, 1994, because the Department had reason to believe that petitioners did not base their cost allegations
on information reasonably available to them. (See May 27, 1994, Decision Memorandum to Barbara Stafford from David
L. Binder Re: Rescinding the COP investigations for Acenor and Roldan.) 
On June 13, 1994, the Department re-initiated COP investigations against Roldan and Acenor based on the allegations
submitted by petitioners on May 9, 1994, and May 24, 1994, pursuant to section 19 CFR 353.51(a) (1994). (See June 13,
1994, Decision Memorandum to Barbara R. Stafford from Richard Moreland Re: Petitioners' Allegations of Sales Below
the Cost of Production for Roldan and Acenor.) We received Roldan's and Acenor's responses, to Section D of the Department's
questionnaire on June 23, and June 27, 1994, respectively. 

On April 26, 1994, the Department received a request from petitioners to postpone the preliminary determination
until 
July 28, 1994. On May 16, 1994, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 25447), a notice announcing the postponement of the preliminary determination until not later than July 28,
1994, in accordance with sections 19 CFR 353.15 (c) and (d).
