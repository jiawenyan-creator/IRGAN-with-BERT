  [Excerpt] The Interior Minister Abdallah Kallel has 
announced, when opening the periodic conference of governors 
this morning, that the conference was taking place in an 
atmosphere of tranquillity, security, political, and social 
concord, progress, and economic development, in addition to the 
country's leading role in foreign affairs. 
  The minister of state pointed out the invaluable directives 
in the speech made by President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali on the 
occasion of the swearing-in ceremony of the new Chamber of 
Deputies, in which pluralism was palpable for the first time in 
the history of the country. 
  The minister of state has pointed out, however, that there 
was no more room for anyone to talk in the name of people from 
outside the parliament anymore and asserted the need for 
everyone to pay due respect to the rule of law, be it 
individuals, institutions, or organizations. 
  He pointed out, furthermore, the great importance the 
president was attaching that everyone should address himself to 
seriously work for the building of a pluralist, unified, and 
prosperous society. [passage omitted]
