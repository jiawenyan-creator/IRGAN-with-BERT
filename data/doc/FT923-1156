FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Losses mount at London Securities
London Securities, the property and investment company, announced increased
losses for the six months to end-March and issued details of its proposed
restructuring.
Losses before tax increased by some Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 6.55m. After a tax
credit of Pounds 747,000, losses per share came out at 8.8p (8.1p).
Directors have proposed a financial restructuring by way of a two-year
corporate voluntary arrangement, a capital reorganisation and an offer of
new shares to shareholders to raise between Pounds 90,000 and Pounds 305,000
 -partially underwritten by Mr David Pearl, chairman.
Directors said that if the reorganisation was not implemented the company
would have no alternative to going into liquidation or receivership.
Following the capital reorganisation ordinary shareholders will hold one new
share for every 35 held.
Preference holders will have two new ordinary shares for every seven
preference shares.
A forced sale now of the group's assets would, they said, result in an
overall deficit of about Pounds 13m.
As previously announced, the year end has been changed to September 30. The
accounts would, therefore, cover the 18 months to September 30 1992.
