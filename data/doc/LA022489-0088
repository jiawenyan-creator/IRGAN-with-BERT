Austrian Social Affairs Minister Alfred Dallinger was one of 11 people killed 
in the crash of a twin-engine plane into Lake Constance near the Swiss-Austrian 
border. The plane, a Commander AC 90, belonging to an Austrian air company, was 
on an internal flight from Vienna to the province of Vorarlberg, carrying nine 
passengers and a crew of two. Police said the plane crashed after the pilot 
aborted an approach to the airport at Hohenems because of fog and tried to fly 
over Lake Constance to Alterhein in Switzerland. The cause of the crash was not 
immediately known.
