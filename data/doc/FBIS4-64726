  [Text] Rauf Denktas, president of the Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus, has said that the international pressure on the 
Cyprus issue may intensify as a result of the economic problems 
currently facing Turkey. 
  Addressing the ZAMAN correspondents' training course in 
Istanbul today, Denktas charged that the United Nations is 
acting on the assumption that there is only one republic in 
Cyprus and the solution remains unsolved because this concept 
does not change. Denktas stressed that Turkey's guarantee, the 
existence of two equal political communities in Cyprus, and the 
acceptance of the Turks as partners and not as a minority 
constitute the cornerstones of the problem's solution. 
  Denktas declared: This is our struggle. We wasted 30 years 
and we are about to launch our 31st year. Thank God, however, 
that we have not made any concessions on these fundamental 
principles. The same tactics were used during the recent 
negotiations. The Cyprus problem currently stands at the same 
point, but pressure is intensifying. This pressure will 
increase even further because of Turkey's economic situation. 
We are obliged to face this as a nation, because the Turkish 
nation would not bow down to any authority regarding a national 
cause.
