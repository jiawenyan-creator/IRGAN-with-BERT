of textile products exported from Kuwait in Categories 340, 341, 640 and 641.

Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854); pursuant to the Memorandum
of Understanding dated May 10, 1994 between the Governments of the United States and the State of Kuwait; and in accordance
with the provisions of Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit, effective
on June 1, 1994, entry into the United States for consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of cotton
and man-made fiber textile products in the following categories, produced or manufactured in Kuwait and exported
during the twelve-month period beginning on January 1, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994, in excess of

Textile products in Categories 340/640, 341/641 and 361 which have been exported to the United States prior to January
1, 1994 shall not be subject to this directive.

Textile products in Categories 340/640, 341/641 and 361 which have been released from the custody of the U.S. Customs
Service under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1448(b) or 1484(a)(1) prior to the effective date of this directive shall

The limits set forth above are subject to adjustment in the future pursuant to the provisions of the MOU dated May 10,
