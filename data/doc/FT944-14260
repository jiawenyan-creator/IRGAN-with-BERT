FT  24 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Dollar doldrums
Remarks on Friday by a US Treasury official suggesting that the
administration would be prepared to intervene in currency markets brought a
brief respite for the dollar. But the currency is still in a sick condition
 -only a touch above its post-war low against the yen and two-year low
against the D-Mark. The market remains concerned that the Federal Reserve
has not taken strong enough action to control incipient inflation. Until
overseas investors are convinced that the Fed is on top of the problem, they
will have no incentive to switch into dollar assets.
Further talking up of the currency by Treasury officials would achieve
little. Even buying dollars in the market would have only a temporary
impact. In the circumstances, it is not surprising that Japan, whose
exporters are suffering from the high yen, has called for joint intervention
by the Group of Seven. Such a co-ordinated defence of the dollar might have
some effect. But it is unlikely to materialise since the Bundesbank is happy
with a strong D-Mark which helps control German inflation.
Further interest rate rises by the Fed are therefore the only real option.
Given that a half-point rise has already been discounted, a full percentage
point increase would be needed to change market sentiment. The US may not
worry much about the dollar per se because trade makes up a relatively small
portion of its economy. But it cannot ignore the impact on Treasury bond
yields which are back at 8 per cent. Nor should it ignore the message that
the currency markets are telling about US inflation.
