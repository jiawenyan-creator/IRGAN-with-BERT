FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: NML drops action against
Foster's
A POTENTIAL impediment to the restructuring of the Foster's Brewing group,
the Australian brewer, has been removed with the withdrawal of legal action
by the National Mutual Life Association.
NML, Australia's second-biggest life office, yesterday dropped the legal
action it brought last week against Wardley Australia as agent for a
consortium of banks known as the Vextin syndicate.
The action challenged the appointment by BHP on June 2 of receivers to the
International Brewing (IBI) group, the major shareholder in Foster's. That
appointment prompted Wardley to request payment from NML of about ADollars
105m (USDollars 78.3m) under standby commitments on loans to IBI.
NML's writ claimed the funds should not be payable, but the Vextin syndicate
subsequently appointed its own receiver to IBI. Yesterday, Wardley said it
had received the amounts due from NML.
With the legal action withdrawn and two receivers appointed at IBI, interest
is focusing on the likely sale of group's main asset,a 38 per cent stake in
Foster's.
