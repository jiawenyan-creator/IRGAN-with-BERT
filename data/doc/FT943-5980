FT  01 SEP 94 / People: Salomon's equity drive
Salomon Brothers is continuing its push into the European equity business by
moving David Karat, head of the firm's European fixed-income capital markets
group, over to lead its UK corporate finance team.
Karat is the archetypal investment banker. The 42-year-old, who started out
as a lawyer with Slaughter and May, is seen as one of Salomon's main
'business-builders' because of his success in restoring the firm's
reputation in the primary fixed-income business following the US Treasury
auction scandal in 1991.
Karat will be replaced by Richard Boath, who followed him to Salomon from
Merrill Lynch.
