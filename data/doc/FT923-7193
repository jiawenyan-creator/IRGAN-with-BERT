FT  19 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Mannesmann falls 11 per cent
on interim results
AFTER initial weakness following the fall in Tokyo, Mannesmann's first-half
results reminded bourses yet again that events this summer have rarely met
expectations, writes Our Markets Staff.
Depressed by start-up losses in its mobile telephone business, and confused
by the impact of extraordinary items, Mannesmann's interims might not be as
bad as they first appeared.
However, after earlier progress reports from Hoogovens, SKF, Peugeot and
Michelin, analysts will be looking carefully at Daimler, Volkswagen, Volvo
and Daf when they come up for consideration next week.
FRANKFURT more than wiped out two hesitant days of gains with a 1.4 per cent
fall, the DAX closing 22.20 lower at 1,533.22. Mannesmann dropped DM29.10,
or 11 per cent, to DM238.20 and other German shares, particularly in the
engineering and steel industries, followed suit.
Analysis of the Mannesmann interim results went to extremes. On the face of
it, profits plunged to DM15m from DM134m; but on one reading, excluding the
mobile phone business, and extraordinary profits in 1991, they could
actually have shown an increase. London took this with a pinch of caution,
quoting the shares at DM240.50 in the post bourse close.
Turnover stayed low, rising from DM3.7bn to D,3.9bn. Among other engineers,
MAN fared particularly badly with a fall of DM15.90 to DM293.60; among the
few advances, Lufthansa's DM5 rise to DM98 followed a long journey down, and
the DAG union's offer of a DM500m cost saving package on Monday.
Siemens fell DM8 to DM603.40. Its Siemens-Nixdorf said yesterday that it
planned to cut 6,000 jobs by 1994/95, but dealers said there was no real
impact on the share price from the news.
PARIS had another quiet day as turnover improved slightly to FFr1.23bn. The
CAC-40 index fell 20.59 to 1,736.72.
Paribas fell FFr11.60 or 3.7 per cent to FFr304.40 after saying that the
issue of 12.5m new preference shares in Ciments Francais last month was
badly received by the market and that it would end up with more than the 20
per cent stake in Ciments Francais that it planned to hold following the
operation. One analyst added that fears that Paribas would have to make
further provisions for its property interests also weighed on the stock.
The insurer Gan dropped to a low of FFr321.20 on news that S &amp; P-ADEF, the
French office of the US credit rating agency, Standard &amp; Poor's, had
downgraded the domestic debt of CIC, Gan's banking subsidiary. It closed
FFr7.50 lower at FFr345.
S &amp; P-ADEF also said that while Gan's more active role in the running of CIC
and the potential synergies between the two groups were positive elements
for the quality of CIC's credit, it also noted that the current
restructuring process was a lengthy task which had not yet resulted in a
real improvement in profitability.
AMSTERDAM ended broadly lower as the CBS Tendency index fell 1.6 to 112.1.
Hunter Douglas dropped Fl 3.60 to Fl 56.00 as investors anticipated
disappointing first-half earnings data. After the close Hunter Douglas
announced a first-half net profit decline of 44 per cent to Fl 23.2m.
The chemical sector was also weak as Akzo lost Fl 1.70 to Fl 145.60 and DSM
slipped Fl 1.30 to Fl 101.40.
MILAN failed to continue Monday's technical rebound and closed broadly lower
in thin volume, which traders estimated at near Monday's paltry L46.2bn. The
Comit index fell 2.66 to 400.77.
All sectors showed losses, with industrial stocks hit the hardest. Fiat lost
L65 to L4,145 while Montedison slid L17 to L1,119. Olivetti lost L63 to
L2,317 while Cir lost L15 to L1,200.
ZURICH regained some ground as the SMI index ended down 11.6 at 1,788.6.
Chemicals were mixed, Ciba-Geigy holding steady ahead of its imminent
half-year results, but Sandoz registered shedding SFr60 to SFr2,810.
STOCKHOLM fell 1.5 per cent in thin trading as the Affarsvarlden General
Index fell 12.4 to 808.3 in thin turnover of SKr341m. Ericsson was the most
active issue ahead of its first-half report today. Its B shares fell SKr2 to
SKr114.
The banking sector, already the scourge of the Nordic equity markets, caused
more trouble elsewhere in Scandinavia. In COPENHAGEN, as the CSE index fell
1.39 to 296.09, Unidanmark dropping DKr5 to DKr145 on a DKr1.48bn pre-tax,
half-year loss.
In OSLO, the all-share index fell 6.61, or almost 2 per cent to another new
low of 345.69, hit by big losses at Den norske Bank. Norway's biggest bank
dropped to a new all-time low of NKr4.2 before closing at NKr4.3, down
NKr1.2.
HELSINKI, meanwhile, saw a 4.4 per cent drop in the bank and finance house
index as the Hex index closed 4.6 lower at 650.5. Bank shares fell on
general concern about the sector, which has been hit by large loan losses.
BRUSSELS closed mixed in moderate trading, as the Bel-20 index ended just
0.71 down at 1,092.74. Petrofina remained weak, losing another BFr120 or 1.3
per cent to BFr9,320.
ISTANBUL's 75-share index lost 24.92 to 4,052.06 as investors stayed away
from the market.
