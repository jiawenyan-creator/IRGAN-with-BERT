MAN FINDS NEPHEW STABBED TO DEATH 
A Carson man found his 21-year-old nephew bound and stabbed to death in the 
victim's apartment in Bonita early Thursday morning, police said. 
Donald McCaney told police that he was supposed to meet his nephew, Jeffrey 
Lamar Malone, on Wednesday night, according to Harry Smith, a spokesman for the 
Sheriff's Department. 
McCaney reported that he waited for Malone for about two hours before entering 
Malone's apartment in the 2900 block of Briarwood Road shortly after midnight 
Thursday, Smith said. 
"Homicide detectives said the victim had been bound at the hands and feet and 
appeared to have been stabbed," Smith said. 
No arrests have been made and an investigation into the case is continuing, 
Smith said.
