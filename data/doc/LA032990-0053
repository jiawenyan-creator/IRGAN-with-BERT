DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: KIDNAPED MAN JUMPS FROM MOVING CAR 
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said Wednesday they are looking for a man 
who forced a Valencia man at gunpoint into his own car, fired shots near his 
feet, robbed him of $20 and pistol-whipped him. 
The hourlong ordeal began in Newhall and ended in Mission Hills when Mall 
Singh, 53, opened his car door and hurled himself onto the street at Rinaldi 
Street and Sepulveda Boulevard. 
He was treated at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills for facial cuts. 
Singh was stepping out of his white, 1990 Toyota Supra on Tuesday about 2:30 
p.m. in front of the Newhall Post Office on 8th Street, when a man ordered him 
at gunpoint to move over and keep his head down, Deputy Dean Scoville said. The 
man then took the wheel and drove to the San Fernando Valley. 
Singh told deputies the man pulled the turban Singh was wearing down over his 
eyes, took his wallet containing $20 and several credit cards, and fired four 
shots into the floor of the car near his feet. Singh was ordered to strip to 
his underwear and was hit on the head with a gun. 
Singh hurled himself from the moving vehicle. The suspect fled in the car. 
"Basically it was a desperate bid for freedom" by Singh, Scoville said. "The 
car wasn't stopped."
