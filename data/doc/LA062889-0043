TAGLIAFERRI REJECTS 'FINAL' TIGER OFFER 
Gino Tagliaferri of Kennedy High, the 1989 Times' All-Valley Player of the 
Year, has declined an offer from the Detroit Tigers and will attend Fresno 
State in the fall. 
Tagliaferri met with Detroit representatives for three hours Tuesday night 
before rejecting what he said was "their final offer" of a $55,000 signing 
bonus. 
"This is for sure," Tagliaferri said. "I wanted ($80,000) because that's what I 
feel I'm worth. I'll get school, a degree, good baseball and, hopefully, I'll 
get drafted even higher in three years."
