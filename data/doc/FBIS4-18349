  [Text] The Cypriot Embassy in Sofia is trying hard to 
obtain the release of a ship under the Cypriot flag that is 
being detained in Bulgaria. 
  The ship Adventstar, of Greek ownership, has been detained 
in 
Burgas for the past 14 months because Bulgarian authorities 
suspected it of transporting merchandise to Serbia in violation 
of the embargo. 
  The company that owns the ship demanded that the cargo, 
which 
is valued at approximately $3 million, not be unloaded. The 
Bulgarian Supreme Court then issued a warrant preventing the 
ship from being unloaded. However, the issue was later 
discussed in the Regional Court, which ordered the unloading of 
the cargo. There are concerns that implementation of this 
decision would endanger the ship's cargo. 
  Efforts are being made on many levels to avoid such a step 
and to obtain a permit allowing the ship to sail. According to 
regulations, when a ship is detained because of suspicions that 
it is violating the embargo against Serbia, it should be 
released when nothing is proven within a reasonable amount of 
time.
