Regular disaster payment computations. 



(a)(1) The prevented planting payment rate is one-third of the established (target) price as provided for in 
1413.103. 

(2) The acreage eligible for payment equals the smallest of the following: 

(i) The acreage of the crop intended for harvest, but which could not be planted to the crop or other nonconserving crops
because of a drought, flood or other natural disaster, or other condition beyond the producer's control; 

(ii) The result obtained by subtracting the acreage of the crop planted in the current year from the acreage of the crop
that was planted or prevented from being planted in the previous year; 

(iii) For crops for which an acreage reduction requirement is in effect or on farms participating in a land diversion,
the amount by which the permitted acreage of the crop for the current year exceeds the acreage of the crop planted in
the current year; or 

(iv) The acreage for which crop insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act is not available. 

(3) Prevented planting payments for each crop shall be the result of multiplying the acreage eligible for payment
times 75 percent of the farm payment yield as provided in 1413.15 times the prevented planting payment rate.


(b)(1) The reduced yield payment rate is one-third of the established (target) price for upland cotton and rice and
one-half of the established (target) price for barley, corn, grain sorghum, oats, and wheat as provided in 1413.103.


(2) Reduced yield payments shall be determined for each crop by multiplying the reduced yield payment rate times the
acreage of the crop on the farm for which crop insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act was not available by 60
percent (75 percent for upland cotton and rice) of the farm program payment yield as provided in 1413.15, and
subtracting the determined production for the eligible acreage therefrom. 

(3) The production from any acreage shall be determined as follows: 

(i) The production from acreage which is not harvested shall be appraised in accordance with 1413.15 and shall
be added to the actual production for the purpose of determining eligibility for and the amount of reduced yield prevented
planted and failed acreage payments; and 

(ii) The farm program payment yield shall be used with respect to any acreage for which the production cannot be determined.
However, if the county committee determines that the acreage was affected by a natural disaster, the farm program
payment yield with respect to such acreage shall be the larger of 60 percent (75 percent for upland cotton and rice)
of the farm program payment yield as provided in 1413.15 or the actual average yield from the harvested acreage
of the crop.
