FT  31 DEC 94 / International Company News: Banco Totta e Acores
Mr Antonio Champalimaud, the Portuguese industrialist, will not purchase 50
per cent of Banco Totta e Acores (BTA) from Spain's Banco Espanol de Credito
(Banesto) unless the government releases him from the legal obligation to
make a full takeover bid, AP-DJ reports from Lisbon.
Under Portuguese law, the purchaser of more than 20 per cent in a
publicly-traded company is required to launch a public offer for enough
shares to form a controlling majority.
