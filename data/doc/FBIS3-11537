  [Text] The Hague (the Netherlands), 22 Mar (EFE) -- The 
Dutch ANP press agency is reporting from Suriname that large 
areas of the capital of Paramaribo were left without power today 
after a group of rebels seized a hydroelectric dam. 
  The Liberation Front of Suriname (FLS) has controlled the 
Afobaka Dam, 100 km south of Paramaribo, since 21 March and has 
mined its main access roads. 
  A spokesman for the Suriname Power Co. confirmed that one of 
the dam's generators, which provides energy to Paramaribo, is no 
longer operating. 
  The FLS, which is holding 30 employees of the "Suralco" 
mining company hostage, is demanding the resignation of the 
government headed by President Ronald Venetiaan. The FLS also 
is requesting improvements in national sanitation and education 
services. 
  Meanwhile, Stanley Rensch, leader of the "Moiwana 86," a 
pro-human rights organization, will attempt to mediate between 
the armed group and the government. He also will seek the 
release of the hostages. 
  On 21 March, the guerrillas issued an ultimatum, which 
expired at 1000 (1300 GMT) today. In the ultimatum, the rebels 
threatened to blow up the Afokaba Dam if their demands were not 
met. 
  President Venetiaan vowed he would not give into terrorist 
pressure, but he expressed his willingness to hold a dialogue 
with the rebels in an effort to resolve the conflict. 
  The ANP press agency added that Cornelis Maisi, a famous 
criminal who escaped from prison several months ago, is leading 
the guerrillas.
