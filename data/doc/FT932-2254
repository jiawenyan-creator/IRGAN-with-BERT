FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cairn Energy raising Dollars 25m for
development
Cairn Energy, the oil and gas exploration company, is selling 4.75m new
shares in its US subsidiary as well as up to 1m existing shares in an offer
that is expected to raise up to Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.6m).
Mr Bill Gammell, chief executive, said the US company would use the proceeds
to develop a 200bn cu ft gas discovery recently made in the Gulf of Mexico.
'The discovery meant that the US part was becoming the major area of our
business and we wanted to use the share sale to re-balance the group,' he
said.
The receipts from the sale will also be used to repay debts of Dollars 2.6m
to Cairn and Dollars 3.6m to its parent in redemption of preferred stock.
These payments, together with the proceeds from the sale of Cairn's shares,
will leave the company with Dollars 11.2m which it plans to use for
developing its current interests and for future investment.
