Applicants' Representations




1. Anchor National is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of California. The Separate
Account was established by Anchor National on May 24, 1994, to fund variable annuity contracts. SCS, a broker-dealer
registered under the Exchange Act of 1934, is the distributor for the Contracts.

2. The Contracts provide for accumulation of contract values and payment of annuity benefits on a fixed and variable
basis. They will be initially funded through five portfolios of the Separate Account. Each portfolio invests its
assets in the shares of one of five available series of Westcore Variable Trust (``Trust'').

3. The Contracts are available for retirement plans which do not qualify for the special federal tax advantages available
under the Internal Revenue Code and for retirement plans which do qualify for the federal tax advantages available
under the Internal Revenue Code. Purchase payments under the Contracts may be made to the general account of Anchor
National under the Contracts' fixed account option (``Fixed Account''), the Separate Account or allocated between
them. The minimum initial purchase payment for a Contract is $5,000 for non-qualified contracts ($2,000 for qualified
contracts). Additional purchase payments may be made in amounts of at least $250 ($100 if made in connection with an
automatic payment plan).

4. If the Contract owner dies during the accumulation period, a death benefit will be payable to the beneficiary upon
receipt by Anchor National of due proof of death. The death benefit is reduced by premium tax incurred by Anchor National,
if any. The death benefit is equal to the greatest of: (1) The total dollar amount of purchase payments made prior to
the death of the Contract owners, reduced by any partial withdrawals and partial annuitizations; or (2) the contract
value at the end of the valuation period during which due proof of death (and an election of the type of payment to the
beneficiary) is received by Anchor National; or, where permitted by state law, (3) in the case of a Contract owner who
was less then age 70 at the date of Contract issue and after the seventh Contract anniversary, the contract value at
the seventh Contract anniversary, increased by any purchase payments made and reduced by any partial withdrawals
and partial annuitizations since that anniversary. 

5. An annual contract administration charge of $30 is charged against each Contract. The amount of this charge is guaranteed
and cannot be increased. This charge reimburses Anchor National for expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining
records relating to a Contract. The contract administration charge will be assessed on each anniversary of the Contract
date that occurs on or prior to the annuity date. In the event that a total surrender of contract value is made, the charge
will be assessed as of the date of surrender without proration. This charge is not assessed during the annuity period.
The contract administration charge is at cost with no margin included for profit.
