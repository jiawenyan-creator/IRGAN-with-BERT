SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SOUTH PASADENA; 
CITY JOINS WASTE AUTHORITY 
The City Council on Wednesday authorized spending $49,700 to join 11 other San 
Gabriel Valley cities in a collective agreement to meet a state-mandated 
reduction of solid waste. 
Under California's 1989 Waste Management Act, cities must reduce landfill 
disposal 25% by 1995 and 50% by 2000. By joining the San Gabriel Valley Solid 
Waste Joint Powers Authority, South Pasadena expects to save from $30,000 to 
$50,000 in its efforts to meet that goal.
