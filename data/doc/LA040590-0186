ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; 
ADULT BUSINESSES MORATORIUM GAINS 
The City Council has extended a ban on new dance halls, nightclubs and topless 
bars, and has scheduled a public hearing that could lead to an extension of a 
separate freeze on adult businesses. 
The council this week voted unanimously to extend the dance hall ban for up to 
10 months and 15 days to give the city more time to prepare an ordinance 
regulating such activities. 
"There are noise problems and there has been violence connected with some of 
these operations," said City Atty. Stuart Scudder. "(City) staff needs more 
time to study relevant court decisions and make the necessary revisions to the 
ordinance." 
The City Council also voted unanimously to schedule a public hearing on April 
16 to consider extending a moratorium on new or expanded adult businesses such 
as adult bookstores, billiard parlors and X-rated video arcades. The moratorium 
applies to new and expanded adult businesses along Garden Grove Boulevard 
between Beach Boulevard and Magnolia Street. JAMES TORTOLANO
