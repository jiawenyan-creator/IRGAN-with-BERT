FT  10 DEC 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Fennel with prosciutto and parmigiano
(serves 4 as a first course or 6 as a vegetable)
For years we have enjoyed Parma ham simply wrapped round grissini bread
sticks or as an appetising partner for ripe melon, figs, peaches or pears.
More adventurous cooks have also begun to use Parma ham as the Emilians do,
sometimes slipping it into pasta fillings, wrapping it around veal or
chicken to give those meats a little lift, or employing it - as one might
use bacon but to more subtle effect - in vegetable cookery, especially with
peas, beans, lettuce, fennel and celery.
Here is a recipe to remember for Christmas as it goes well with cold roast
poultry, pork and veal:
1 1/2 lb Florentine fennel; 1oz unsalted butter; 1 tablespoon olive oil; 2oz
prosciutto di Parma, cut into snippets; 1-1 1/2 oz Parmigiano-Reggiano
cheese, freshly grated; 1 1/2 oz coarse, slightly stale breadcrumbs.
Trim the fennel, reserving the feathery fronds, and cut the bulbs into thin
wedges. Saute them for five minutes in two-thirds of the butter mixed with
the oil. Reduce the heat, cover and steam-fry for 10 minutes, stirring
occasionally, until golden and well cooked through.
Rub one hot gratin dish (or four oeuf sur le plat dishes) with butter paper.
Put the fennel into the dish(es), sprinkling the chopped fennel fronds,
black pepper (but no salt), all of the ham and most of the cheese between
layers. End with a layer of fennel.
Melt the rest of the butter in the saute pan. Away from the heat, stir in
the crumbs to sop up the fat. Add the rest of the grated cheese to the
crumbs and sprinkle the mixture over the fennel. Grill until golden.
