  [Text] Japanese Foreign Minister Kakizawa revealed on 19 
June that Japan is prepared to help North Korea transform North 
Korean nuclear facilities if North Korea accepts international 
nuclear inspections. Minister Kakizawa had an interview with 
NHK on 19 June and said that Japan is prepared to share the cost 
of transforming North Korean nuclear facilities into those 
producing less plutonium if North Korea resumes talks with Japan 
to normalize diplomatic ties and accepts international 
inspections on the suspected nuclear facilities. 
  Minister Kakizawa stressed that Japan's support of 
transforming the reactors should be decided through negotiations 
between Japan and North Korea and said that if the United States 
unilaterally requests Japan's support after having dialogue with 
North Korea, the Japanese Government would not be able to 
convince its people.
