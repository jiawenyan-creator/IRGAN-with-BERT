  [Text] The DEA "will have problems" with the Chamber of 
Deputies Constitution Committee if it is established that it 
exceeded its diplomatic duties and its role in the 
investigations into the alleged link between the MIR [Movement 
of the Revolutionary Left] and drug trafficking. 
  This was stated by an MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] deputy and 
member of the Constitution Committee, Juan del Granado, who said 
there are rules between Bolivia and the United States regarding 
the DEA's duties in Bolivia. 
  According to bilateral agreements between the U.S. Embassy 
and the Bolivian Foreign Ministry, DEA agents are banned from 
carrying weapons, participating in antinarcotic operations, and 
arresting and interrogating individuals on Bolivian territory. 
  Investigations into the alleged links of some MIR leaders to 
drug trafficking reveal that some DEA agents exceeded their 
duties by institutionally conducting the investigations and 
influencing the report on FELCN [Special Antinarcotics Force]'s 
conclusions. 
  Del Granado stated that there is strong evidence the DEA was 
directly involved in the subject by carrying out duties and 
roles not mentioned in the bilateral agreements between the two 
countries. 
  He added that an attempt will be made to establish the 
obvious deceitful, abusive, and prepotent behavior of DEA agents 
in our country.
