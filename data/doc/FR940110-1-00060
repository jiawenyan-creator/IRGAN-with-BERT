 

Consistent with 960.4(b) of the Board's existing AHP 
regulation, 960.6(b) of the proposed rule provides that each 
Bank shall allocate comparable amounts of AHP subsidies for each 
AHP funding cycle during the year. See 12 CFR 960.4(b). 



E. Specific Application and Scoring Requirements 



1. Application Requirements 



The proposed rule does not mandate use of a uniform AHP 
application form by all of the Banks. Rather, the Board believes 
that, consistent with current practice under the AHP, each Bank 
should continue to devise its own AHP application form, because 
each Bank will have its own special information requirements as a 
result of the specific priorities and scoring criteria adopted by 
the Bank. 

However, as discussed further below, all AHP applications must 
satisfy certain threshold requirements in order to be considered 
for scoring under the proposed rule. Thus, certain information 
from applicants must be received by all Banks in order for the 
Banks to be able to determine whether the applications satisfy the 
threshold requirements in the proposed rule and to score the 
applications under the scoring criteria. Accordingly, 960.7(a) 
of the proposed rule provides that each Bank shall require 
applicants for subsidized advances or direct subsidies under the 
AHP to submit to the Bank an application which, at a minimum, 
contains all of the information described below and any other 
information which the Bank determines is necessary in order to 
take action on such application, including the following: 

(1) A concise description of the purpose of the request and 
proposed uses of the funds, and its relationship to the priorities 
identified in proposed 960.10(d), the targeting criterion 
identified in proposed 960.10(e), and the other objectives 
identified in proposed 960.10(f); 

(2) A statement of how the project will satisfy the authorized 
uses and long-term requirements, including a description of legal 
mechanisms to be used to ensure compliance by the project with 
such requirements, contained in proposed 960.3 and 960.5; 

(3) A statement of how the project will comply with the fair 
housing law requirement contained in proposed 960.9(b); 

(4) A statement of how the project will satisfy the feasibility 
requirement contained in proposed 960.9(d); 

(5) A statement of how the project's sponsor satisfies the 
qualification requirement contained in proposed 960.9(e); 

(6) A statement of whether a subsidized advance or direct 
subsidy has been requested and the amount of such funds requested;
