<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vitaliy Masol by attributed </F>
VYBIR correspondent; place and date not given: "It Is Worthless 
Waiting for a Miracle"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [VYBIR] Will Ukraine sign an 
agreement on economic union [with Russia]? 
  [Masol] All states sign certain agreements on economic 
unions or common markets. I want to state that we will not be 
able to live and work without a common market. 
  [VYBIR] Thus, will Ukraine be an associate or full member of 
the European Union? 
  [Masol] Let us put it differently. To buy energy resources 
and other products in Russia, we should also sell something 
there. You can refer to this as you want -- even as an economic 
union. [passage omitted] 
  [VYBIR] Who is our main partner in the West? 
  [Masol] These are Germany, France, Great Britain, and 
Austria. We should have friendly relations with all Western 
countries, provided they are interested in developing mutually 
beneficial relations with us. [passage omitted] 
  [VYBIR] What is your attitude toward free trade unions? 
  [Masol] There must be trade unions. Yet, they should keep 
in mind that the most important thing is that everyone works. 
People must work and earn money. However, if trade unions only 
take care of wages, it will be hard to reach an understanding.
