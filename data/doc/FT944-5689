FT  02 DEC 94 / Westminster housing chief defended
The director of housing at Westminster City Council had nothing to gain from
vote-rigging, his barrister told the public inquiry yesterday.
Mr Graham England, director of the council's housing department since 1985,
is one of the 10 Conservative councillors and officials accused of
vote-rigging by the district auditor, Mr John Magill. Mr Jeremy McMullen QC,
for Mr England, said: 'For him there was no advantage, no promotion, no
money, no greater influence and no difference to his job security.'
He said Westminster councillors had put great pressure on officials during
the leadership of Dame Shirley Porter in the 1980s. 'Others may have felt
the climate at Westminster required them to comply in matters with which
they had professional disagreements. That is not the case with Graham
England. He has not tried to hide behind the threat of dismissal, duress or
pressure of work to excuse himself.'
In his provisional report the district auditor said that the 10 individuals
had aimed to use the designated sales policy to attract likely Tory voters
into eight marginal 'key' wards.
Mr McMullen argued that the aim of targeting the wards disappeared on June
17 1987 when councillor Peter Hartley, was made chairman of the housing
committee. Mr Hartley - one of the 10 accused - was motivated by a new and
radical policy of selling as many council homes as possible within the law,
said Mr McMullen.
The inquiry continues.
