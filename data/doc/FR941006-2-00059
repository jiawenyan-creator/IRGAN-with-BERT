approval under section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1842) to become a bank holding company or to acquire
voting securities of a bank or bank holding company. The listed companies have also applied under  225.23(a)(2) of
Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(2)) for the Board's approval under section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act
(12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) and  225.21(a) of Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.21(a)) to acquire or control voting securities or
assets of a company engaged in a nonbanking activity that is listed in  225.25 of Regulation Y as closely related to banking
and permissible for bank holding companies, or to engage in such an activity. Unless otherwise noted, these activities
will be conducted throughout the United States.
The applications are available for immediate inspection at the Federal Reserve Bank indicated. Once the application
has been accepted for processing, it will also be available for inspection at the offices of the Board of Governors.
Interested persons may express their views in writing on the question whether consummation of the proposal can ``reasonably
be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency,
that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' Any request for a hearing on this question must be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
Unless otherwise noted, comments regarding each of these applications must be received at the Reserve Bank indicated
or the offices of the Board of Governors not later than October 31, 1994.
