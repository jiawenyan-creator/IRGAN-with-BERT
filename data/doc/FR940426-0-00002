Importation of Restricted Articles; Port Everglades, FL

ACTION:

 Final rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the regulations concerning the importation of nursery stock, plants, roots, bulbs, seeds, and other
plant products by allowing restricted articles that require a written permit to be imported into Port Everglades
at Fort Lauderdale, FL, provided they are then moved by ground transportation and under U.S. Customs bond to the Miami,
FL, plant inspection station. Because many U.S. importers use shipping companies that go into Port Everglades, FL,
but not Miami, FL, these importers prefer to import restricted articles that require a written permit through the
Port Everglades, FL, port of entry. However, Port Everglades, FL, does not have the necessary facilities to inspect
and clear those restricted articles. This final rule will provide U.S. importers with another option for importing
those restricted articles while protecting U.S. agriculture from significant risk of plant pests and diseases.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The regulations in 7 CFR part 319 prohibit or restrict the importation into the United States of certain plants and
plant products to prevent the introduction of plant pests. Sections 319.37 through 319.3714 (referred to
below as the regulations) contain restrictions on the importation into the United States of nursery stock, plants,
roots, bulbs, seeds, and other plant products. Sections 319.372 and 319.373 list prohibited and restricted
articles. 

Section 319.3714(b) of the regulations contains a list of the approved ports of entry through which restricted
articles may be imported into the United States. Restricted articles that do not require a written permit may be imported
through any of the approved ports of entry; restricted articles that do require a written permit, because of their
greater plant pest and disease risk, may be imported only through ports equipped with special inspection and treatment
facilities. Ports having these special facilities, known as plant inspection stations, are indicated on the list
by an asterisk. 

On October 28, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 5796957970, Docket No. 930291) a proposal to amend the regulations by allowing restricted
articles that require a written permit to be imported into Port Everglades at Fort Lauderdale, FL, provided they are
then moved by ground transportation and under U.S. Customs bond to the Miami, FL, plant inspection station. We solicited
comments concerning our proposal for a 60-day comment period ending December 27, 1993. We received one comment by
that date. The comment was from the Florida State Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The comment was
in favor of the proposal. 

Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as
a final rule, with minor nonsubstantive editorial changes for clarity. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 

This final rule allows restricted articles that require a written permit, for example, nursery stock, to be offered
for importation into the United States at the Port Everglades, FL, port of entry. Based upon requests from importers,
we anticipate that about two to three containers of nursery stock per month could arrive at the Port Everglades, FL,
port of entry, predominantly from Costa Rica and Guatemala. 
Now, about 40 to 50 companies import nursery stock into the United States. Thirty to 40 of these companies employ 100
or fewer people, making them small entities by the Small Business Administration's size criteria. Three of these
small entities will most likely ship most of the nursery stock that could arrive at Port Everglades, FL. 
Based upon U.S. Department of Agriculture information, we estimate that this rule change could result in no more than
five additional import companies shipping nursery stock to Port Everglades, FL. This estimate is based upon the assumption
that most importers who now ship nursery stock directly to the Port of Miami will continue to do so because it is more
feasible and cost effective. All of these companies are considered to be small entities. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Executive Order 12778 



This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: 
(1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; 

(2) Has no retroactive effect; and 

(3) Does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of
1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). 



List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 319 



Bees, Coffee, Cotton, Fruits, Honey, Imports, Nursery stock, Plant diseases and pests, Quarantine, Reporting and
