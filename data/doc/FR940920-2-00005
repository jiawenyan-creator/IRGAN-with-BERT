Meridian, MS, Area


Pursuant to its authority under the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of June 18, 1934, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a81u),
the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) adopts the following Order:


Whereas, 

by an Act of Congress approved June 18, 1934, an Act ``To provide for the establishment *** of foreign-trade
zones in ports of entry of the United States, to expedite and encourage foreign commerce, and for other purposes,''
as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a81u) (the Act), the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) is authorized to grant to
qualified corporations the privilege of establishing foreign-trade zones in or adjacent to U.S. Customs ports of
entry; 


Whereas, 

the Board's regulations (15 CFR Part 400) provide for the establishment of special-purpose subzones when existing
zone facilities cannot serve the specific use involved; 


Whereas, 

an application from the Vicksburg/Jackson Foreign Trade Zone, Inc., grantee of Foreign-Trade Zone 158, for authority
to establish special-purpose subzone status at the electronic audio and acoustical products manufacturing facilities
(9 sites) of the Peavey Electronics Corporation in the Meridian, Mississippi, area, was filed by the Board on August
19, 1993, and notice inviting public comment was given in the 

Federal Register

 (FTZ Docket 4793, 58 FR 46627, 9293); and, 


Whereas, 

the Board has found that the requirements of the FTZ Act and Board's regulations are satisfied, and that approval of
the application is in the public interest; 
Now, therefore, the Board hereby authorizes the establishment of a subzone (Subzone 158B) at the plant sites of the
Peavey Electronics Corporation in the Meridian,

 Mississippi, area, at the locations described in the application, subject to the FTZ Act and the Board's regulations,
including 400.28.
