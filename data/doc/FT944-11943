FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Oerlikon-Buhrle sees higher
sales in 1994
Oerlikon-Buhrle, the Swiss engineering company, expects 1994 group sales to
be between SFr3.6bn (USDollars 2.9m) and SFr3.7bn, including the acquisition
of Leybold of Germany. This compares with SFr2.99bn in 1993, AP-DJ reports
from Zurich.
Mr Hans Widmer, chairman and chief executive, said 'the Leybold acquisition
should boost sales this year'.
Leybold specialises in vacuum technology, which is used to produce compact
discs.
Buhrle has said it expects to post 1994 group net income of SFr65m,
excluding Leybold, up 3.5 per cent from SFr62.8m. Including the acquisition,
however, Mr Widmer said he expected 1994 net income to be even higher,
adding that Leybold expects to report net profit of about DM47m (USDollars
31.3m) this year.
