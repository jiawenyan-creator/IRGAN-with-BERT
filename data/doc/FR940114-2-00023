<DOCTITLE>Intent To Prepare a Draft Environment Impact Statement for the Proposed Coast Rock Products Mining and Reclamation
Plan In and Along the Sisquoc and Santa Maria Rivers in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties, CA</DOCTITLE>

ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The proposed action is to mine construction-grade aggregate deposits from a seventeen-mile stretch of the Santa
Maria and Sisquoc Rivers, both waters of the United States. The California Division of Mines and Geology has determined
that the most significant concentration of construction-grade aggregate in the region occurs in and just adjacent
to the rivers. This deposit contains material that is important to two counties for the construction, maintenance
and rehabilitation of public and private facilities. The proposed action is intended to help satisfy the long-term
demand for commercially-useable aggregate material in the region.



Because the action will require a permit under section 404 of the Clean Water Act (as amended) and adverse impacts to
the aquatic ecosystem may result, the Corps has determined that the proposed action warrants an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.

A Joint Review Panel (JRP) consisting of the primary permitting agencies for the project has been formed to coordinate
multi-agency review. The JRP includes representatives of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, California Division
of Mines and Geology, County of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo will serve as co-lead agencies under the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The environmental document will therefore be circulated as a joint Environmental
Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

1. Proposed Action



Coast Rock Products, Inc. (Coast Rock), has applied to the Corps of Engineers for a section 404 individual permit to
remove sand and gravel material from a seventeen-mile stretch of the Santa Maria and Sisquoc Rivers over the course
of the next 25 years. In 1989, the California Division of Mines and Geology (CDMG) reported that currently permitted
sources of construction-grade aggregate (classified as MRZ2 by CDMG) are theoretically sufficient to supply
only 65 percent of the projected aggregate demand in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties (the service area)
over the next 50 years. CDMG further found that the largest concentration of construction-grade material in the service
area extends along these rivers from a narrow canyon in the Sisquoc Ranch to the ancient floodplain underlying the
City of Santa Maria. Because much of this material is no longer accessible due to surface improvements or established
land use, the most viable long-term sources have been identified to occur within and adjacent to the rivers. Thus,
the overall purpose of the proposed action is to mine high-quality, construction-grade aggregate (MRZ2 classified)
deposits from within the service area for the long-term utilization of the resource (at least the next 25 years) and
reclaim mined lands in accordance with the requirements of the California State Surface Mining and Reclamation Act
(SMARA).

In addition to mining sand and gravel, Coast Rock proposes several secondary objectives to the overall project purpose.
These include providing flood protection, enhancing groundwater recharge, reclaiming farm land lost to erosion
and past mining, and establishing wildlife habitat.



2. Alternatives



At least the following alternatives will be considered: (1) No action; (2) applicant's preferred project; (3) off-site
(outside the 100-year floodplain) mining; (4) mining in the river (within the 100-year floodplain) but not within
section 404 jurisdiction; (5) a reduced-scale project; and (6) alternative landuse/reclamation scenarios.



3. Scoping Process



a. Federal, State and local agencies and other interested private citizens and organizations are encouraged to send
their written comments to Mr. Michael Jewell at the address provided. This scoping comments period will expire 45
days from the date of this notice appearing in the 

Federal Register

.

b. Significant issues to be analyzed in depth in the draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) include hydrology/hydraulics,
biological resources, water quality, cultural resources, air quality, transportation, groundwater recharge,
noise, aesthetics, and socioeconomic.

c. Coordination will be undertaken with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
California Department of Fish and Game, State Historic Preservation Office, and California Regional Water Quality
Control Board.

d. As noted above, the project will also undergo review under the California Environmental Quality Act. A draft EIS/EIR
will be published which will discuss both NEPA and CEQA issues.



4. Scoping Meeting



A scoping meeting will be held on Thursday, January 27, 1994 from 1:30 to 4:30 and then again from 6:30 to 8:00 to assess
preliminary issues relative to the Coast Rock Mining and Reclamation Plan. The scoping meeting will be held at the
County Government Center, Board of Supervisors Hearing Room, 511 East Lakeside Parkway, City of Santa Maria, County
of Santa Barbara, California. Participation in the scoping meeting by Federal, State and local agencies, and other
interested private citizens and organizations is encouraged.



5. DEIS Schedule



The current schedule estimates that the DEIS will be available for public review and comment in May 1994.
