LOCAL; 
GUNMAN KILLS 1 NEAR VAN NUYS BAR 
One man was killed and another was wounded by a gunman outside a Van Nuys bar 
after a fight between a man and his girlfriend, Los Angeles police said today. 
The shootings occurred at 9:30 p.m. Wednesday near the front door of the 
Leprechaun Irish Pub in the 6500 block of Ventura Canyon Avenue, Detective Don 
Tabak said. The name of the 20-year-old Van Nuys man who was killed has not 
been released. Gary Frakes, 20, of Van Nuys was shot in the leg and was in good 
condition at Valley Presbyterian Hospital. 
Tabak said that an hour before the shooting, a couple had argued in the bar. 
The man and woman, whose identities were not released, went outside and the 
argument continued. The man left when several other bar patrons went out to 
protect the woman, police said. 
Police believe that the gunman later drove past the bar with at least one other 
man and fired a gun about eight times at the people still standing in front, 
Tabak said. The gunman fled in the car after the shooting. No arrests had been 
made by midday.
