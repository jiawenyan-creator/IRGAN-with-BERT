  [Text] [Announcer] Eduardo Vallarino, presidential 
candidate for the Christian Democratic Party [PDC], has said his 
party is willing to hold talks with all sectors to preserve 
democracy in our country. Fernando Fernandez filed this report: 
  [Fernandez] The ticket headed by Eduardo Vallarino and Rene 
Orillac has revealed the PDC position on the country's political 
situation in light of possible alliances for the 8 May 
elections. The announcement was made before a large number of 
journalists who attended the news conference the PDC regularly 
grants on Wednesdays. Presidential candidate Vallarino said the 
PDC would support the best options for the country in any 
negotiations: 
  [Vallarino] "We are actually holding talks with all parties, 
including our staunchest opponents. It is a responsibility of 
the political parties to keep communication channels open with 
even their worst enemies to ensure that this election is honest 
and void of violence." 
  [Fernandez] The PDC candidate also condemned and criticized 
those who advocate violence as a means to impose their ideas. 
  [Vallarino] "We do not believe in violence, and we will 
prevent violence. We think it is irresponsible to even talk 
about violence. The country now has an excellent chance to show 
the world something good, something magnificent -- namely, free 
and honest elections." 
  [Fernandez] The PDC Central Campaign Committee also 
announced 
that the party will conclude its campaign on 5 May. 
  [Announcer] Meanwhile, today, Ruben Dario Carles, 
presidential candidate for the Change '94 alliance, said talks 
among the country's various civilist groups are continuing, and, 
therefore, an alliance to confront the PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary Party] cannot be ruled out. Carles reaffirmed 
that his ticket is the best one to head such an alliance. 
Alvaro Alvarado filed this report: 
  [Carles] "Several political groups are currently holding 
discussions. The possibility exists. They are currently 
discussing that." 
  [Alvarado] Professor Carles does not support the proposal of 
seeking a presidential candidate from among the vice 
presidential candidates from the various civilist tickets after 
getting all of the civilist presidential candidates to agree to 
quit the race. 
  [Carles] "I do not foresee such a thing happening. We have 
the best ticket, whether you look at it on a person-to-person 
basis or collectively. We have the best government program. We 
are the most capable of executing our program and fulfilling it 
without poems, soap operas, and songs." 
  [Alvarado] Meanwhile, mayoral candidate Mayin Correa pointed 
out that should an alliance not be established among the 
political leaders, the people will rally behind Carles: 
  [Correa] "Seventy percent of Panamanians are civilist. We 
know Ruben Dario Carles. We know of his background, 
capabilities, and honesty. I guarantee that a majority of 
Panamanians, being aware of what they know about Carles, will 
vote for the best option -- Carles -- on Election Day." 
  [Alvarado] Carles made his statements during a march with 
Mayin Correa and supporters in the Bella Vista area. Carles and 
Correa talked to many Panamanians along the way. The march 
toured part of Via Espana and ended on Via Argentina, where a 
small rally was held.
