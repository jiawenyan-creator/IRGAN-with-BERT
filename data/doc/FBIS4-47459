  [Abstract] The ecological use of carbon fiber sorbents for 
effective removal of toxic gases and vapors from atmospheric air 
has become pressing. Vapors of organic solvents, such as 
benzene, are present in the vented wastes of various chemical 
enterprises, and the study of the sorption dynamics of these 
compounds is essential for the development of sorption methods 
of air treatment and the design of ecological equipment. In the 
present work some results are presented on a study of the 
sorption dynamics of benzene vapors on carbon foam fibers. The 
lengths of the mass transfer zones, the unused layer heights, 
and the coefficients of protection for various through-put rates 
and benzene vapor concentrations were determined. The dynamic 
characteristics of the sorption process as a function of the 
vapor-air mixture were determined by Forsythe approximation of 
the data. Figures 3; references 10 (Russian).
