FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: Sales decline hurts result at
Asahi Glass
ASAHI Glass, the leading Japanese maker of glass products, reported an 11.7
per cent fall, to Y20.05bn (Dollars 190m), in pre-tax profit for the first
half to June. It blamed the result on falling sales of glass and
construction materials along with private construction orders in Japan.
Sales for the period were down 0.7 per cent to Y484.4bn, compared with a
year earlier, with core glass and construction material sales down 2.4 per
cent. Those of electronics equipment were 15 per cent higher.
Asahi Glass is a leading supplier of glass bulbs for televisions, demand for
which has been in decline for the past three years. However, the company is
continuing to expand its own electronics operations, which now account for 5
per cent of sales, including magnetic disks and optical fibres.
'It seems that a business recovery will require more time,' Asahi Glass
said.
For the full year to the end of December, the company is forecasting a 0.8
per cent increase in sales, to Y1,020bn, and a 2.4 per cent rise in pre-tax
profit to Y41bn.
