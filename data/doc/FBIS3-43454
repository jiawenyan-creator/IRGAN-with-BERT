  Law, Order Ministry's `Short Memory' -- Law and Order 
Ministry Spokesman Craig Kotze "was in full flight on the SDUs 
[self-defense units]," says a page 8 editorial in Johannesburg 
THE STAR in English on 7 January. "The controversial ANC 
[African National Congress]-aligned self-defence units, he said, 
not only attacked the police, they attacked Inkatha and the 
public and now they were fighting among themselves. The ANC 
plans to try to restore order by holding an internal inquiry was 
just not good enough, he fulminated. Kotze has a short memory. 
On how many occasions have the police not done exactly the same 
when faced with problems?"

  New Defense Force More Acceptable to More People -- "There 
can be no better demonstration of the distance South Africa has 
travelled towards its new beginning than the imminent creation 
of a new defence force," begins Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in 
English on 7 January in a page 6 editorial. "It was often said 
most senior SADF [South African Defense Force] officers, unlike 
some of their SA [South African] Police counterparts, were 
always comfortable with the successive phases of National Party 
reforms. Events have shown this view to be correct. It seems 
fairly clear that the same applies to the ANC and its military 
wing." Whatever its potential shortcomings and excesses, the 
new defense force "promises to be infinitely more acceptable to 
the bulk of the population -- and therefore more effective -- 
than the organisation it is going to replace."

  `People' Believe ANC To Take From Whites To Give to Them -- 
"The ANC is obviously aware that the millions of its supporters 
believe it is going to wave a magic wand and conjure up houses 
and jobs soon after the election result is announced," notes a 
page 6 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 7 
January. "A common belief among the `people' is that the ANC 
will take from whites and give to them. The ANC should tell the 
`people' that the coming elections are about forging a 
constituent assembly, a democratic body of elected 
representatives to draw up the final constitution and prepare 
South Africa for its first nonracial general election. This 
general election will come only after five years and during that 
time the country will need social and economic reconstruction. 
Therefore, the job of explaining this to the `people' lies not 
on Nelson Mandela's shoulders alone, as the case seems to be at 
the moment, but on the entire ANC leadership." 
<H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>
  Peacekeeping Force `Prep School' for MK Recruits to NDF -- 
Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 7-13 
January 
in a page 14 editorial believes the ANC is directing its "real 
efforts and resources" at "finding agreement on the future 
makeup and command and control structures of the SADF, to be 
called the National Defense Force (NDF). Bearing out this are 
the decisions of the ANC and the government to send their senior 
commanders not to the Command Council of the Peacekeeping Force, 
but to the management body of the defence force, the Joint 
Command Council." The ANC "seems to have made concessions, 
sacrificing the short-term efficacy of the Peacekeeping Force 
for the long-term loyalty of the NDF." So the Peacekeeping 
Force "is essentially a sideshow, a prep school for MK's 
[Umkhonto we Sizwe -- ANC military wing] recruits to the NDF, 
and a flak catcher which will be responsible for the difficult 
task of policing during the pre-election period. It will ensure 
that the defence force emerges with its legitimacy more intact 
than if it stands in the frontline itself during the tense and 
virulently partisan weeks before the poll."
