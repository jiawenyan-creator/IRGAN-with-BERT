  [Text] In a statement to the national daily EL WATAN to be 
published on 5 February, Youcef Khatib, the chairman of the 
National Dialogue Commission [NDC], revealed that the method of 
appointing the head of state was the subject of a recommendation 
made in a constitutional council memorandum to the Higher State 
Council and the NDC. 
  The NDC chairman said that the national consensus conference 
has achieved its main objective of establishing the tradition of 
dialogue among Algerians. Khatib added that history will record 
the fundamental role played by the civil society, describing it 
as the third force. 
  In reply to a question on the obscurity that surrounded the 
identity and credibility of the dissolved Islamic Salvation 
Front's figures, whom the NDC had contacted, Khatib sufficed by 
saying it was a representation, without offering further 
explanation.
