FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Bass advances 20% to Pounds 271m
A REDUCTION of Pounds 48m to interest charges of Pounds 27m enabled Bass,
the UK's leading brewer, to raise half-year pre-tax profits by 20 per cent
from Pounds 225m to Pounds 271m.
Apart from the benefit of reduced borrowings due to the rights issue, the
result was helped by the deferral of capital investment programmes 'pending
more favourable opportunities' though spending still rose from Pounds 166m
to Pounds 252m.
Mr Ian Prosser, chairman, said that while consumer confidence appeared
stronger in the UK, there was 'little evidence of any increase in demand in
our principal markets.'
Earnings per share for the six months to April 11 fell to 22.5p (22.7p). But
the interim dividend was increased to 5.25p (4.95p).
Operating profits rose marginally to Pounds 286m (Pounds 282m) on turnover
down slightly at Pounds 2.23bn (Pounds 2.25bn) in spite of the disposal of
1,500 pubs.
The brewing division benefited from reduced costs and lifted operating
profits from Pounds 83m to Pounds 99m on turnover of Pounds 843m (Pounds
820m). Strong gains in the free trade limited the overall decline in beer
volumes to 2.3 per cent against a 4.4 per cent fall in the market. Tennent's
pilsner and super lagers, and Bass, Stones and Worthington ales increased
volume sales. The charge for bad debts was raised from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds
9.7m.
Britvic, the soft drinks business, held turnover at last year's level of
Pounds 205m, but profits fell to Pounds 7m (Pounds 8m) after increased
marketing costs.
Profits from pubs fell by 25 per cent from Pounds 118m to Pounds 88m - about
Pounds 21m of the decline was accounted for by pub disposals.
The group has now sold, or agreed sales on, all but 290 of the 2,740 outlets
it is required to free under government orders. The sales, at average prices
20 per cent above book value, have raised Pounds 380m gross, of which Pounds
125m was accounted for in the half year.
The introduction of electronic sales equipment in the group's 3,000 managed
pubs will increase costs during the next two years, but is expected to
reduce staff by 700.
Leisure operations showed a 31 per cent increase in operating profits to
Pounds 34m (Pounds 26m), due mainly to the performance of the enlarged chain
of bingo clubs.
Holiday Inn Worldwide raised operating profit by 26 per cent to Pounds 54m
(Pounds 43m) on turnover of Pounds 255m (Pounds 274m). Revenue per available
room in managed hotels in the US increased 2.2 per cent, against a 0.2 per
cent rise in the franchised hotels. In the rest of the world, the
improvement was 3.4 per cent and 5.2 per cent respectively.
COMMENT
Headline profits may owe a lot to the interest charge reduction, but there
are some encouraging signs at the trading level. Bass has retained 70 per
cent of the beer volumes in the 2,450 pubs it has sold and is gaining
strength in the rest of the free trade. Business through free trade pubs is
10 per cent higher, and there has been a 7 per cent improvement in the
take-home market. The figures suggest the gains are not being made by giving
the beer away. In present conditions, a 5 per cent improvement in Holiday
Inn margins is quite an achievement, and promises rapid progress when the
recovery eventually comes. Analysts are forecasting full-year profits of
about Pounds 570m, a 33 per cent increase. On a prospective p/e of 13.4, the
group stands at a 10 per cent discount to the market and appears
significantly under-rated.
