FT  03 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy turnover in BP
TURNOVER in BP surged to 54m shares as a block of 14.2m failed to find a
home in the UK and eventually reached more enthusiastic US investors.
It is believed that a large institution decided to sell the shares through
County NatWest. The securities house was said to have tried unsuccessfully
to place them with other UK institutions at around 241p. Salomon Brothers
was then said to have bought them at around that level to sell on to US
institutions. In the past month, the US holding in BP is thought to have
risen from 8 per cent to 10 per cent.
The overhang of shares in the market and continuing worries over
first-quarter profits, as well as the dividend, knocked BP back 6p at one
stage, a substantial fall for the stock. Once the deals were out of the way
the shares rallied to close a net 3 down at 246p.
Vodafone in demand
Cellular network operator Vodafone Group ended its recent dismal run as a
number of brokers decided that the shares looked cheap. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
the house broker, reiterated its buy stance as figures for March showed new
connection rates at their highest since October 1990.
Henderson Crosthwaite, the agency broker, moved from a sell to a buy,
analyst Mr Brian Newman describing the figures as 'the first signs of
recovery in demand from new cellular subscribers'. Mr Tim Hirst at Lehman
Brothers pointed to the fact that Vodafone was approaching its all-time
price/earnings relative low, and was well positioned for economic recovery.
The shares improved 4 1/2 to 314 1/2 p in busy turnover of 4.7m.
Rubbish had an influence on the water companies yesterday, with one
depressed by its waste disposal activities while two others gained support,
in a sector remaining vulnerable to political developments.
Severn Trent slipped 9 to 301p as County NatWest lowered its forecast of
profits to March 1992 by Pounds 7m to Pounds 263m and for the next financial
year by Pounds 8m to Pounds 270m on the poor performance of Biffa, Severn's
waste disposal subsidiary acquired from BET last year.
South West Water picked up 2 to 337p on news that it is to form a joint
venture company with a leading Spanish waste management concern. The 50-50
owned company will be known as Peninsula Waste Management.
Wessex Water firmed a penny to 384p. The company is involved in a British
joint venture with US-based Waste Management International. The latter is
floating 75m shares next week, 20 per cent of its enlarged capital, mainly
in London and New York.
Revived bid speculation, and the announcement that a chief executive had
been appointed, helped Fisons, which bucked the market to end 8 up at 334p.
The Fisons bid talk, which has featured for some time, focused yesterday on
Medeva, the fast-growing group headed by former Glaxo chief executive Mr
Bernard Taylor. Medeva fell 10 to 251p.
In terms of the appointment, Mr Cedric Scroggs was not the market's first
choice, but any disappointment was already in the Fisons share price and
observers were relieved at the ending of uncertainty.
Continuing forecast downgrades affected ICI, finally 15 lower at 1224p.
Good advances for the UK's two biggest insurance brokers, Sedgwick (up 10 at
214p) and Willis Corroon (9 ahead at 242p), reflected recent dollar strength
and hopes of premium increases.
Insurer Sun Alliance was buoyed in early trading by relief that the
underlying annual figures were not worse. The group announced a Pounds 466m
loss, at the lower end of market estimates. However, it also came out with a
positive statement and a stronger than expected balance sheet. Agency broker
James Capel reduced its 1992 loss forecast by Pounds 50m to Pounds 100m. Sun
closed unchanged at 250p.
There were few surprises in Redland's results, but the market was pleased
that there were no black holes and the integration with Steetley could now
proceed. Redland moved ahead 17 to 467p in heavy volume of 5m shares.
Activity in the hotels sector centred once again on Queens Moat Houses, in
which 7.1m shares were traded after Tuesday's 7m. Mercury Asset Management
was believed to be the big seller yesterday, with Kleinwort Benson reported
to have placed the stock with institutions. The shares eased a penny to 75
1/2 p.
Forte was weak, as one house found itself caught with some 2m shares on its
books as rival marketmakers turned sellers. The stock lost 4 to 222p on
turnover of 2.2m.
Hoare Govett reiterated its buy stance on Granada Group and upgraded its
1992 profits forecast by Pounds 3m to Pounds 114m and 1993 by Pounds 6m to
Pounds 136m on optimism over the group's business services division. The
stock gained 4 to 228p.
Packaging and printing group Bowater dropped 26 to 701p as investors sold
their nil-paid rights. The nil-paid retreated 29 to 76p.
The prospect of troubled conglomerate Lonrho being taken private continued
to boost the shares, which regained a further 8 to 79p.
Talk surrounding BET of a placing of 2m shares and another profits downgrade
 -recently analysts shifted their estimates towards the Pounds 100m mark -
left the stock 4 lower at 121p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 11m.
A large seller of new FT-SE 100 constituent Siebe depressed the shares 19 to
618p.
Rolls-Royce rose 5 to 154p, boosted by news of engine orders from Thai
Airways to power two more Boeing 777 airliners. British Aerospace put on 5
to 300p, lifted by Wednesday's news of an agreement between the US and
European Commission over air subsidies.
Submarine builder VSEL tumbled 30 to 270p as dealers came to the view that a
Labour government would not order a fourth Trident submarine.
Simon Engineering fell 8 to 244p over fears of payment difficulties for work
the company has carried out in Armenia.
Suggestions that one marketmaker had been left holding unwanted Tate &amp; Lyle
shares pulled the stock down to 393p in early trading, but the price rallied
to 398p to leave a decline of only 2 on the day.
Associated Fisheries receded 8 to 108p on reporting profits down to Pounds
1m from Pounds 3.4m and a provision of Pounds 5.5m for losses involving
Macfish, its joint venture with Geest. Unilever advanced 11 to 907p on a buy
recommendation from SG Warburg and the sale of its animal feed business to
Harrisons &amp; Crosfield.
