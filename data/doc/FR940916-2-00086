 

On July 20, 1993, Dr. Bodian responded to the Demand for Information stating that (1) on infrequent occasions a precalibrated
dose of radioiodine was administered without prior use of dose calibrator; (2) a request for termination of his license
(No. 291241701) was made on January 25, 1993; and (3) his listing (as an authorized user) on the Englewood
Hospital license (No. 290851901) was a carry over from years ago, and that any administration of radiopharmaceuticals
to his patients at Englewood hospital was done under the supervision of the hospital radiology department.

The NRC OI report issued July 26, 1993 determined that notwithstanding Dr. Bodian's statements to the NRC, the doses,
with a few exceptions, were not assayed with a dose calibrator prior to administration, even though Dr. Bodian was
aware that such assays were required. This finding is based on the fact that although the Licensee's records indicate
that 30 iodine131 doses were provided to patients between January 1990 and April 1992, the NRC has found that
most doses were not assayed for the Licensee in the Hospital's dose calibrator during that time. This willful failure
to adhere to this requirement, as well as the willful false statements to the NRC during the inspection on April 6, 1992
and the April 7, 1992 telephone conversation, constitute violations of 10 CFR 35.53, 10 CFR 30.9, and 10 CFR 30.10.



III



Based on the above, it appears that Dr. Bodian, the Licensee, engaged in deliberate misconduct that constitutes a
violation of 10 CFR 30.10(a)(1) and that has caused the Licensee to be in violation of 10 CFR 35.53. It further appears
that Dr. Bodian deliberately provided to NRC inspectors information that he knew to be incomplete or inaccurate in
some respect material to the NRC, in violation of 10 CFR 30.09 and CFR 30.10(a)(2). Dr. Bodian has demonstrated an unwillingness
to comply with Commission requirements. NRC must be able to rely on its licensees to comply with NRC requirements,
including the requirement to provide complete and accurate information. Willful violations are of particular concern
to the Commission because they undermine the Commission's reasonable assurance that licensed activities will be
conducted in accordance with NRC requirements. Dr. Bodian's actions have raised serious doubt as to whether he can
be relied upon to comply with NRC requirements and to provide complete and accurate information to the NRC. Consequently,
protection of the public health, safety and interest require that Dr. Bodian be prohibited from engaging in NRC-licensed
activities for a period of 5 years and to notify the NRC prior to resumption of any NRC-licensed activities at any facility
after termination of the five year prohibition.

In telephone conversations on July 18, 19, and 20, 1994, with Dr. Ronald R. Bellamy of the NRC Region I office, Dr. Bodian
agreed not to be involved in any NRC-licensed activities for a period of five years, and to notify the NRC prior to resumption
of any licensed activities at any facility after that five year prohibition. I find that the Dr. Bodian's commitments
as set forth in that conversation are acceptable and necessary and conclude that with these commitments the protection
of the public health and safety is reasonably assured. In view of the foregoing, I have determined that the public health
and safety require that the Dr. Bodian's commitments in the telephone conversations of July 18, 19, and 20, 1994 be
confirmed by this Order. Dr. Bodian has agreed to this action. Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I have also determined that
the significance of the violations described above is such that the public health and safety require that this Order
be immediately effective.



IV



Accordingly, pursuant to section 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and
the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Parts 30 and 35, It is hereby ordered that:




1. For a period of five years from the date of this Confirmatory Order, Jerome E. Bodian, M.D., shall not engage in any
NRC-licensed activities. NRC-licensed activities are those activities which are conducted pursuant to a specific
or general license issued by the NRC, including, but not limited to, those activities of Agreement State licenses
conducted pursuant to the authority granted by 10 CFR 150.20.

2. When, for the first time, Dr. Bodian is employed in NRC-licensed activities following the five year prohibition,
he shall notify the Regional Administrator, NRC Region I, 475 Allendale Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406,
within 20 days prior to engaging in NRC-licensed activities, including activities under an Agreement State license
when activities under that license are conducted in areas of NRC jurisdiction pursuant to 10 CFR 150.20. The notice
shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the NRC or Agreement State licensee and the location where
licensed activities will be performed.

The Director, Office of Enforcement, may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above conditions upon a showing by
Dr. Bodian of good cause.



V




Any person adversely affected by this Confirmatory Order (Effective Immediately), other than Dr. Bodian, may request
a hearing within 20 days of its issuance. Any request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, D.C. 20555. Copies also shall be
sent to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington D.C. 20555, to the Assistant
General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address, to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region I, 475
Allendale Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406, and to Dr. Bodian. If such a person requests a hearing, that person
shall set forth with particularity the manner in which his or her interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall
address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d).




If a hearing is requested by a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an Order designating
the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this
Confirmatory Order (Effective Immediately) should be sustained.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), any person adversely affected by this Order, other than Dr. Bodian, may, in addition
to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate
effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness is not based
on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error.

In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the
date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An answer or request for a hearing shall not stay the immediate
effectiveness of this order.




Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 8th day of September 1994.
