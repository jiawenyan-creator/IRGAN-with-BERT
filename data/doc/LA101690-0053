PATERSON ON REFUSING TO GO TO SAUDI ARABIA 
When I was in the Marine Corps in World War II, anyone like Paterson, sitting 
back in picturesque Hawaii writing columns while his buddies were stationed in 
a combat zone where fighting could break out any day, was considered a coward 
and would be making small rocks out of big ones at Portsmouth.
