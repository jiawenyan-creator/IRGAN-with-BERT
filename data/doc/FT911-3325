FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Zenith slides deeper into red
ZENITH Electronics, which is competing for a share of the high-definition
television market, yesterday unveiled a deeper first-quarter loss and a drop
in sales.
The US company, which is in the middle of a proxy battle, incurred a
first-quarter net loss of Dollars 23.7m, or 85 cents a share, compared with
a loss of Dollars 4m, or 15 cents, last time.
Mr Jerry Pearlman, chairman, described the first-quarter results as
'unsatisfactory'.
News of the loss was not expected to help Zenith as it fights a proxy
contest by Nycor to replace three directors. A count of the proxy votes from
yesterday's annual meeting was not expected to be announced for at least
several weeks.
Nycor, a holding company spun off from Fedders, the air conditioner maker,
holds 8.2 per cent of Zenith's shares. It claims the company has no business
plan to turn around consumer electronic losses. Nycor and Fedders are
controlled by the Giordano family of New Jersey.
Zenith has responded that the Giordanos, with only low technology
experience, do not understand the long-term, high-tech strategy of the
company, which is engaged in a race for the estimated Dollars 80bn market of
high-definition television.
Zenith may have undermined Nycor's arguments about weakness in consumer
electronics with its sale in March of a near 5 per cent stake to Goldstar,
South Korea's largest consumer electronics maker, for Dollars 15m.
Goldstar wanted access to the US company's high technology.
