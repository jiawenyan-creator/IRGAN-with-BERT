NIBBLES AND BITS 
The Target store at 6835 Katella Ave. in Cypress has given the newly formed 
Cypress Pops Orchestra $4,000 to help underwrite its free inaugural concert 
July 15 on the Cypress Civic Center Green. The program will range from music 
from the movies to the Suite from Bizet's "Carmen." 
Other performances by the orchestra are scheduled for Aug. 12 (which also will 
be free), Oct. 22, Nov. 13 and Dec. 10. Conductor John Hall is still looking 
for string players. Auditions will be held June 24. For information, call (714)
