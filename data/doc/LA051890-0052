LAGOMARSINO ON CHILD CARE 
Iam outraged that Rep. Bob Lagomarsino plans to vote against his own child-care 
bill, as he stated in an article in The Times on April 13. 
If he is indeed concerned about the cost, then he should vote against the B-2 
bomber and save enough money to fund many child-care programs. Children, our 
most precious possessions, are relegated to the lowest priorities of our 
budget. 
Mr. Lagomarsino, I challenge you to rethink your values and your vote.
