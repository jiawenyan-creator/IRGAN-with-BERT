General description of report:

 This information collection is voluntary [12 U.S.C. 248(a)(2)]. The individual respondent data on amounts

552(b)(4)]. Data on interest rates paid on deposits are made available to the public on request.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The reports collect detailed information on amounts, offering rates, interest expense, and fees on various types
of retail deposits from a stratified sample of BIF-insured commercial and savings banks. The revisions are designed
in part to make the data collected more accurately reflect deposit pricing. In addition, other changes eliminate
items no longer deemed necessary to conducting monetary policy. The Federal Reserve uses data from the FR 2042 and
FR 2042a in a number of ways, including construction and interpretation of the monetary aggregates, measuring elasticities
in money demand equations, and assessing the changing behavior of banks in pricing deposit accounts.
