<F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F>
Udo van Kampen in Brussels on 28 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Van Kampen] Would you say that today's combat 
action was a turning point in NATO's history? 
  [Woerner] In NATO's history -- yes, of course. It was the 
very first combat action. In addition, it was a combat action 
not to defend one's own territory against a threat but, if you 
like, out-of-area -- that is, beyond our normal alliance 
territory. However, this operation has nothing to do -- at least 
not directly -- with the other tasks that we have set ourselves 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is an operation to enforce the 
no-fly zone. 
  Apart from that, there are other operations --for example, 
to 
enforce this exclusion zone [Ausschlusszone] -- and I think that 
one should beware of general judgments. In any case, it makes 
it clear that NATO is now confronted with a completely new task, 
which it is fulfilling successfully: crisis management and the 
enforcement of UN peacemaking measures.
