FT  22 JUN 92 / Observer: Name game
Greece's determination to lay claim to the name Macedonia and keep it out of
the grasp of the former Yugoslav republic knows few bounds.
Having launched an international campaign to publicise the tourist
attractions of its own Macedonia, the Greek government has now begun to
repaint its assets to make the point.
Spotted at Paris's Orly airport last week: a state-owned Olympic airliner
resplendent in new livery, and proudly bearing the name Makedonia in
foot-high lettering on its nose-cone.
