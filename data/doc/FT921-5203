FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Hyundai units to issue corporate
bonds
THE South Korean government has allowed five subsidiaries of the Hyundai
group to issue corporate bonds worth a combined Won45bn (Dollars 58.7m) this
month, AP-DJ reports from Seoul.
The government's approval is expected to ease the group's financial pinch.
Hyundai subsidiaries have been suffering from an acute shortage of cash
after the government reportedly ordered government-controlled commercial
banks not to make fresh loans to Hyundai companies and restrict them from
raising funds in stock and bond markets.
The allowed bonds are: Won20bn for Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction;
Won10bn for Coryo Development; Won5bn for Hyundai Precision Industries and
Won5bn each for Hyundai Electronics and Hyundai Wood Industries.
