SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Coast Guard will hold a public meeting on April 4, 1994, to consider the study, ``Review of Marine Safety Issues
Related to Uninspected Towing Vessels'' conducted by the Coast Guard, and will seek public comment on the recommendations
identified in the study. The Coast Guard may use the study, along with public comment, to develop rules. Of particular
interest, and likely to be the subject of expedited rulemaking, are measures that could provide the necessary means
to, and improve the navigational ability of, the operator; these measures include requiring the carriage of charts,
publications, and radar, and requiring the operator to be qualified as a radar observer.



The Coast Guard recognizes that there are insufficient facilities for radar-observer training immediately available
to accommodate all currently licensed operators of uninspected towing vessels (OUTVs). Therefore, the Coast Guard
is contemplating for these OUTVs: (a) An interim, short-term, training program, required soon, followed by (b) a
more extensive program leading to an endorsement as radar observer, required on or before the scheduled license renewal.
The Coast Guard is contemplating for new applicants, only the more extensive program.

Comments on the practicality and utility of these requirements, their costs, the content of both interim and extensive
courses, the length of time appropriate for implementation, and the administrative burden would be especially helpful.

Four of the topics that the Coast Guard has added_inspection, manning, pilotage of towing vessels, and evaluation
of retesting regulations_it added because of Congressional interest. This arose during the Secretary of Transportation's
testimony before the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Navigation, House of Representatives, on March 3, 1994.

The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to submit written data, views, or arguments. Persons submitting comments
should provide two copies, include their names and addresses, identify the study by docket number CGD 94014,
and give the reason for each comment. Each person wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped,
self-addressed postcard or envelope.
