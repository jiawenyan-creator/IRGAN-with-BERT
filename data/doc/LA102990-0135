SHORT TAKES; 
WITCHES DISPEL SERIOUS NOTIONS BREWING UP THEIR PREDICTIONS 
In their annual Halloween look at what's up next year, American witches today 
predicted that Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Oliver L. North will record a rap 
album attacking the Soviet Union and the National Endowment of the Arts. 
Muffin juggling also will became a big fad. 
In the 17th annual survey compiled by the New York Center for the Strange, the 
witches also forecast shortages of volleyballs, garlic and chopsticks and a new 
book will claim that Elvis Presley was a Soviet agent. 
Not only that, Jimmy Carter, Michael Jackson and Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher will buy homes on Staten Island, and Dan Quayle will begin his 
campaign for the presidency in '92. 
Some of the predictions for next year: 
* Walter Cronkite will host a TV game show based on current headlines with 
Vanna White. 
* "Inspired by his close friendship with Jane Fonda," Ted Turner will launch a 
24-hour, all-exercise cable TV network. 
* Donald Trump will franchise a pizza chain called "The Don."
