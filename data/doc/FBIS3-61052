  [Text] Combat training continues in the Navy despite the 
economic and political crisis being experienced in the country. 
Thus, the nuclear powered submarine Kasatka commanded by Captain 
1st Rank A. Yefanov made a transit from the Northern Fleet to 
the Pacific Fleet in the period from 16 August through 12 
September. After covering thousands of nautical miles in the 
watery depths of two oceans and beneath Arctic ices, the Kasatka 
moored safely at a berth in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy. In the 
opinion of Rear Admiral M. Motsak, senior officer of the 
deployment, the submariners demonstrated a high training level 
and the ship showed the reliability of equipment. The traditions 
of Arctic under-ice deployments, which you can read about on pp 
91-94 of this journal issue, continue.
