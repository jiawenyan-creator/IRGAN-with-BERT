Methadone Treatment Is Not Enough''] 
  [Text] The right to prescribe methadone to drug addicts 
will still lie with the practicing physician, but according to 
Social Affairs Minister Yvonne Herlov Andersen (Democratic 
Center) physicians in private practice will no longer decide on 
their own that methadone treatment is the right course for a 
given drug addict. 
  ``Doctors will go to the treatment centers and a decision 
will be made by a team consisting of the physician, 
psychologists, social welfare officials, and anyone else who is 
involved at the decentralized center,'' the social welfare 
minister said. 
  Recently, the prescribing of methadone by private physicians 
has been sharply criticized both by the social welfare agencies 
of the counties and by the Physicians' Association. 
  In all too many cases, the use of methadone has not been 
complemented by actual treatment. As a result, officials at the 
Social Welfare Directorate of Copenhagen County want to assume 
responsibility for deciding whether or not methadone treatment 
is necessary. 
  ``Methadone is highly habit forming, so it is important that 
it not be used alone. It must be followed up with both social 
and psychological measures. A plan must be drawn up together 
with the addict indicating, among other things, when he will be 
drug free,'' said Peter Ege, chief social welfare physician in 
Copenhagen. 
  There are approximately 10,000 drug addicts in Denmark. It 
is 
estimated that just under 3,000 are being treated with 
methadone. By far the majority of the methadone patients are 
being treated by private physicians. The government plans to 
come out with an extensive report on drugs within the next two 
to three weeks. It will include measures to be taken in the area 
of methadone treatment.
