FT  03 JUL 93 / NHS to employ outside expertise
THE PRIVATE sector is to be invited to help the National Health Service
develop the role of purchasing authorities under the government's health
reforms.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said yesterday that he wanted all
health authorities to have managers with substantial purchasing experience
on their staffs within two years.
Commercial organisations will be asked to share their experience of
purchasing at health service conferences and meetings. Health authorities
will be expected to recruit purchasing staff from the private sector.
Under the purchaser-provider split of the health service reforms the
management of hospitals has been separated from the purchasing functions of
district health authorities, family health service authorities and GP
fundholders.
Until now most attention has been given to developing the provider side of
the restructured NHS - by next April 95 per cent of hospitals will be
locally-managed trusts. The government will now concentrate on the
purchasers.
Dr Mawhinney will take a personal role in the recruitment of part-time
non-executive members of health authority boards when vacancies arise, to
ensure that candidates are chosen who can contribute to strengthening
purchasing arrangements.
It is the purchasing function that will eventually determine the extent to
which the contract-based reforms change the NHS. Until now most contracts
have been based on patterns that existed before the reforms came into
effect. But purchasing authorities are being encouraged to examine how they
spend their resources. This will lead to them shifting contracts to
hospitals offering better value, and reconsidering spending priorities.
