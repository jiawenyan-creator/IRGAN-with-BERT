FT  19 JUL 93 / Private investors granted fewer BT shares
PRIVATE investors in the UK have been allocated fewer BritishTelecom shares
than in the government's previous sale after strong demand from
institutional investors, particularly in North America.
Institutional investors have been allocated 40 per cent of the Pounds 5bn
BT3 offer - compared with 33 per cent in 1991 - after bidding for 2.9bn
shares, with 1.2bn on offer.
The price of the international offer was set yesterday at 420p, 12p above
BT's closing price on Friday of 408p. The 12p above the market price is
considered to be the time value associated with paying in three instalments.
A UK Treasury official said it was the first time the government had sold
shares in a company at its effective market price.
The UK public offer - which is set at a 10p discount to the international
offer price - was allocated 60 per cent of the available shares. Individual
shareholders applied for only 1bn shares compared with 1.7bn in 1991.
More than 95 per cent of applicants in the UK public offer will receive an
allocation and more than half will get all they applied for. However, non-BT
shareholders who applied for more than 700 shares through the Share
Information Office or more than 1,500 through a share shop will not receive
anything.
UK institutions accounted for just 46 per cent of bids in the international
offer. They have been allocated an extra 2 per cent, partly because they are
thought less likely to sell their shares in the aftermarket than overseas
investors. North America accounted for 27 per cent of the international
offer and was allocated 20 per cent against 17 per cent last time.
SG Warburg, the government's global co-ordinator, said it could exercise a
'Green Shoe' option - or stabilisation provision - by buying an additional
91.5m shares, or 7.5 per cent of the 1.2bn shares for up to 30 days.
