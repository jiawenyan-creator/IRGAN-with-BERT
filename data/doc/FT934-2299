FT  15 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: Local officials gain a national
platform - Some of the president's old foes have won seats on the federation
council
The first results of voting for the federation council - the new
parliament-to-be's upper house and the one which represents the interests of
the regions - show it to be overwhelmingly filled with representatives of
the regional nomenklatura.
Of different persuasions, they are all there, above all, to lobby for their
regions. They also include some old foes, both of President Boris Yeltsin
and of the reformers.
Mr Aman Tuleev, leader of Kemerovo, comes in on a big vote. He gave some of
the most virulent anti-Yeltsin speeches in the former parliament. From
Sverdlovsk comes Mr Eduard Rossel, the former governor sacked by Mr Yeltsin
for attempting to make his region a new Urals republic.
Two of the men alleged to have masterminded the abortive coup in August 1991
are in. Still untried, they are Mr Vasily Starodubtsev and Mr Anatoly
Lukyanov. From the republic of Kalmykia comes the millionaire president, Mr
Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who before the suppression of the last parliament
attempted to organise anti-Yeltsin sentiment outside it.
There are also reformers, like the first deputy prime minister, Mr Vladimir
Shumeiko, from Kaliningrad. But the largest part of the parliament will be
of uncertain political allegiance, capable of being mobilised both for and
against the president and the government.
For some, such as Mr Rossel and the leaders of many of the republics, the
constitutional issue will be given pride of place. The Russian constitution,
now embedded in law, is clear that all areas are subordinate to the federal
levels of power. However, some have already claimed sovereignty within
constitutions which they themselves have adopted.
This is an issue which, like many others, has been finessed until now, but
which will rise again all the more strongly now that the republican leaders
have a democratic mandate and a pulpit from which to state their case.
In the single mandate seats for the lower house, or state duma - being half
the 450 seats elected on a first-past-the-post system rather than on party
lists - the situation is also unclear. Russia's Choice, the main reformist
party, believes it has done much better here than in the half elected by
party lists, which is dominated by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal
Democratic party.
In part this was for the negative reason that the central electoral
commission banned the mention of any party affiliation, and thus people
voted for the best-known name - many of whom were democrats - rather than
for an anti-reform party which they might otherwise have preferred.
However, the disorganisation among the democrats showed itself here as well.
In the Central Petersburg district, the nationalist television presenter Mr
Alexander Nevzorov came first past the post with 25 per cent of the vote,
while the two democratic candidates took almost double between them. The
latter, from Russia's Choice and the Yabloko grouping, apparently disliked
each other more than they did the prospect of Mr Nevzorov's victory.
