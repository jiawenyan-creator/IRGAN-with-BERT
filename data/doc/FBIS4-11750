    [Editorial Report] Cairo MENA in Arabic at 1355 GMT on 31 
March carries the "text" of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on 
security measures to be taken in the West Bank town of Hebron. 
The MENA version has been compared with the above AFP version 
and found to be identical except for the following variations: 
  The MENA version omits paragraphs 2 through 8. 
  Paragraph 13, second sentence reads: ...in promoting 
stability in the city, monitoring the situation there, and 
exerting efforts to restore... (changing "reporting" to 
"exerting" and supplying variant wording). 
  Paragraph 18, only sentence reads: ...of Palestinians and 
prevent any events affecting it... (adding words "prevent any.")
