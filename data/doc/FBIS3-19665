  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias returned from 
Washington and made the following statement to correspondents: 
It was a very short trip with many meetings and of course the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina was the issue under discussion. 
As I said, the talks I had with both U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, 
as well as with Presidents Alia Izetbekovic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, were very 
interesting and substantive. 
  I think, Papoulias said, the current effort by the U.S. 
Administration has brought, at least in its first phase, 
successful results, that is, the signing of an agreement for 
federation between Bosnia's Muslims and Croats. The meeting 
between the European Union [EU] foreign ministers in Ioannina 
[northwestern Greek town] on 26-27 March will bring important 
decisions on the role that the European Union will play in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of course the U.S. factor is welcome as is 
that of Russia, but the EU Action Plan remains the center for 
reaching a viable and peaceful solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Papoulias said.
