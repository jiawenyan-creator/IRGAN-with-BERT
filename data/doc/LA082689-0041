BALLET REVIEW; 
MELNIKOV AS ALI IN KIROV 'CORSAIRE' 
The role of the slave Ali in the Kirov Ballet production of "Le Corsaire" can 
be a scene-stealer. But the character was eclipsed by the titular hero and the 
heroine when a new Ali took over Thursday at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. 
Kiril Melnikov, 23, who succeeded Farukh Ruzimatov in the role, simply ignored 
the contradiction of a production that insists upon calling Ali a friend of the 
protagonist rather than his slave. Although Melnikov went through prescribed 
motions of submissive kneeling, he exhibited no trace of servility. 
Unlike Ruzimatov, Melnikov did not compensate for any presumed lowly status 
with brooding aloofness, heroic faithfulness or instinctive alertness to 
danger. At best, he looked like a kid brother, a follower, a coolish friend, a 
would-be aristocratic Robin to a decidedly noble Batman. 
Technically, he danced with rugged strength and a lack of finesse, though he 
partnered with reasonable security. Sturdy and muscular, he achieved decent 
elevation, maintained fairly clean shapes in the air and scarcely wandered in 
his final series of turns. 
He also proved blocky and sluggish, however, the tensile line and energy of his 
extensions clotted in the torso. He completed a circuit of barrel turns with 
evident effort, landed heavily and, overall, suffered from hitches in momentum 
and rhythm. 
For all that, he was no sulking, sultry, shrinking violet. Unlike his 
predecessor, Melnikov took his bows alongside the familiar Conrad (Evgeny Neff) 
and Medora (Tatiana Terekhova) at the end of the grand pas de trois. The crowd 
roared. CHRIS PASLES
