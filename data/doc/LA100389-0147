THE SIDELINES; 
FOYT CRASHES IN SPEEDWAY SESSION 
Four-time Indianapolis 500 winner A. J. Foyt was injured today when he crashed 
at Charlotte Motor Speedway during a practice session for the All-Pro Auto 
Parts 500. 
"He hit the wall in turn three, slid about 300 yards and came to a stop at the 
entrance of pit road," said speedway spokesman Eddie Gossage. "The track 
emergency staff worked about 10 minutes to get him out of the car. They were 
mostly trying to be easy because they didn't want to hurt him worse than he 
was." 
Gossage said Foyt was "conscious and alert" when taken to the speedway 
hospital. He was later airlifted to Charlotte Memorial Hospital, and hospital 
officials would give no details of his injuries or condition. 
"We don't know why he hit the wall," Gossage said. "It was just practice. He 
wasn't racing the car. But he hit the wall very hard."
