  [Excerpt] Several months after the neuropathy epidemic, 
only 37 percent of the population in Pinar del Rio takes the 
Neo-Vitaminic 2 vitamin supplement that is given to the 
population for free. This was determined through a survey 
carried out by the center of sociopolitical studies of the 
provincial committee of the Communist Party of Cuba in Pinar del 
Rio. The survey showed 40 percent do not use the supplement 
regularly, nine percent believe they do not need the supplement, 
eight percent took the supplement only for a few months, and 
three percent take other vitamins they consider more 
effective.[passage omitted]
