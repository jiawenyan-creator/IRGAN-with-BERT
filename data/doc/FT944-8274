FT  21 NOV 94 / Observer: Sailing by
Good news from British shipbuilders. Only days after the last rites were
performed for Swan Hunter, one of Europe's best-equipped shipbuilders,
Britain has secured an order for . . . a square-rigged sailing ship.
It seems that any navy worth its salt has a square rigger in its fleet these
days. So the Indian government has commissioned Hampshire naval architect
Colin Mudie to design a 177ft three-masted barque to train India's young
sailors before they move up to something more powerful.
Mudie has carved out quite a niche for himself. He has designed the Young
Endeavour (Australia), Tunas Samudera (Malaysia) and Lord Nelson. His latest
vessel will accommodate 45 cadets and have a 2,000 mile range. The bad news
is that the ship will be built in Goa and not Sunderland.
