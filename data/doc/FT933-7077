FT  24 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: British Rail
British Rail's management seems wedded to the notion that the best way to
raise net revenues at times of weak demand is to cut services and raise
prices. Such an attitude comes naturally to a monopoly which believes it can
shamelessly exploit a captive customer base. Even in Network SouthEast's
commuterland, it is starting to look old-fashioned.
Sooner or later a policy of charging more for less will lead inexorably to
lower rather than higher revenues. If nothing else, private ownership of
rail would surely see a more imaginative approach to revenue generation.
Increased usage might even produce a lower unit cost, for all that expensive
track and signalling infrastructure.
