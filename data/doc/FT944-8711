FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Barclays in Pounds 300m preference buy-back
Barclays Bank yesterday became the latest company to reduce excess capital
by announcing that it would buy back Dollars 500m (Pounds 300m) of
non-cumulative preference shares. The move follows Boots' Pounds 500m
buy-back of ordinary shares earlier this week.
Barclays, which has already redeemed Dollars 700m and DM250m (Pounds 100m)
of bonds that formed part of its total capital base, had to gain Bank of
England approval for the preference share redemption because it will cut the
bank's core capital ratio.
The bank has been accumulating capital without a large rise in its assets
because of limited loan demand. It has also just sold its US asset-based
lending operation to Shawmut National Corporation for a premium of Dollars
290m over book value.
The preference share redemption and bond repayments will together reduce its
Pounds 10.5bn of capital by Pounds 879m. It will also match its capital with
assets better in currency terms, since it has been selling retail banking
assets in the US.
The move would have reduced its capital to risk asset ratio at the half-year
to 10.1 per cent rather than 11.1 per cent, while the tier 1 ratio of core
capital to risk-weighted assets would have been 6.6 per cent rather than 7
per cent.
The bank said it would pay a Pounds 17m premium for redeeming the preference
shares. This would be borne in this financial year along with the Pounds 63m
cost of redeeming bonds, and attributable earnings would rise by about
Pounds 30m a year from 1995.
Mr Oliver Stocken, finance director, said that the bank had primarily been
motivated by matching its dollar capital to its dollar assets. 'As we have
run down the US retail business, we have had a surplus dollar capital
position,' he said.
