FT  03 JUN 94 / US steps up N Korea pressure
The US yesterday vowed to press for United Nations sanctions against North
Korea, as a UN agency admitted it could no longer verify the Pyongyang
regime had not diverted nuclear materials for weapons purposes.
The move for economic sanctions gathered pace despite a call by Russian
President Boris Yeltsin for an international conference to make the Korean
peninsula nuclear-free instead of immediate steps to punish the North.
A senior official with President Bill Clinton in Rome said the US would
begin consultations with other members of the UN Security Council. But the
US could face problems in winning the backing of Russia and China, each of
which could veto sanctions.
Mr Clinton earlier blamed North Korea for the deepening crisis over its
refusal to co-operate with the UN International Atomic Energy Agency.
The Vienna-based IAEA said its inspectors could no longer give any assurance
that North Korea had not diverted plutonium from its 5MW nuclear reactor at
Yongbon to a nuclear weapons programme. This was because of North Korea's
recent unsupervised unloading of spent fuel rods from the reactor.
The IAEA said it was reporting this finding to the Security Council. Its
chief, Mr Hans Blix, is expected to fly to New York to brief the Security
Council, possibly today.
Mr Yeltsin's remarks, showing Russia's desire for more say in world affairs
but also echoing South Korean caution, were made at a news conference with
South Korea's visiting President Kim Young-sam. 'It is too early to talk
about sanctions,' Mr Yeltsin said. There should first be a meeting of North
and South Korea, Russia, the US, Japan and China.
North Korea, meanwhile, accused the US of using a U-2 spy plane to carry out
a survey of its coastline in preparation for an invasion.
