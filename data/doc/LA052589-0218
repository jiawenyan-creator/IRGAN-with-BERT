IN BRIEF; 
MEXICAN BOXER DIES OF BLOOD CLOT 
Mexican boxer Hector Ruiz Coello, 20, died in Tijuana three days after being 
knocked out in a professional fight, news reports said today. 
The Mexico City newspaper Esto said Ruiz Coello, who had only 10 fights, some 
of them as an amateur, in three years, died Wednesday of complications stemming 
from a blood clot in the brain. 
Ruiz Coello, a flyweight, was knocked out in the sixth round by Cecilio 
(Torito) Espino, the report said. Minutes later, Ruiz Coello fell unconscious 
while walking to the dressing room. He never regained conciousness.
