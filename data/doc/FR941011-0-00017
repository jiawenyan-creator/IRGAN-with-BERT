Airworthiness Directives; Dornier Model 328100 Airplanes


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Dornier Model 328100 airplanes.
This action requires repetitive tightening of the screws and quick-release fasteners on the wing/body fairing panels.
This amendment is prompted by reports of loosened wing/body fairing panels. The actions specified in this AD are intended
to prevent structural damage to the horizontal or vertical stabilizer and potential injury to persons on the ground
due to loosened wing/body fairing panels that may separate from the airplane.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Effective October 26, 1994.


The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the
Federal Register as of October 26, 1994.
Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before December 12, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA), which is the airworthiness authority for the Federal Republic of Germany, recently
notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on all Dornier Model 328100 airplanes. The LBA advises that
during flight testing, prior to certification of Model 328100 airplanes, the quick-release (camlock) fasteners
on the wing/body fairing panels were found to be loose on several airplanes. In another instance, an operator of Model
328100 airplanes reported that a loosened fairing panel separated from an in-service airplane and struck
an antenna on the empennage while the airplane was in flight. Investigation into the cause of these loosened panels
revealed that the flex of the wing, coupled with the relative motion between the fairing panel and its supporting structure,
may have caused the fasteners to back out. Such loosened fasteners may have allowed air loads to pull the panel loose
from its supports, which resulted in the panel separating from the airplane. In addition, the tightness of the fasteners
may have compressed the relatively soft material of the fairing panel, which may have contributed to the loosening
of the fasteners. This condition, if not corrected, could result in structural damage to the horizontal or vertical
stabilizer and potential injury to persons on the ground due to loosened wing/body fairing panels that may separate
from the airplane.


Dornier has issued Alert Service Bulletin ASB32853004, dated August 2, 1994, which describes
procedures for repetitive tightening of the screws and quick-release fasteners on the wing/body fairing panels.
The LBA classified this alert service bulletin as highly recommended and issued LBA Airworthiness Directive 94009/3,
dated September 8, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the Federal Republic
of Germany.
This airplane model is manufactured in the Federal Republic of Germany and is type certificated for operation in the
United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable
bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the LBA has kept the FAA
informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the LBA, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States.
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent structural damage to the horizontal or vertical
stabilizer and potential injury to persons on the ground due to loosened wing/body fairing panels that may separate
from the airplane. This AD requires repetitive tightening of the screws and quick-release fasteners on the wing/body
fairing panels. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described
previously.
This is considered to be interim action. The manufacturer has advised that it currently is developing a modification
that will positively address the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. Once this modification is developed, approved,
and available, the FAA may consider additional rulemaking.
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.
