FT  11 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ratners revival
The surge in the share price of Ratners showed no signs of abating as
investors continued to buy strongly into the heavily indebted jewellery
group. The shares have now jumped in value by 2.5 times in the past three
weeks. Yesterday a huge 30m shares were traded, thrice Friday's hefty total,
to close 8 1/4 up at 40p.
Stores analysts were at a loss as to why the shares are suddenly so popular,
although good results from the smaller Goldsmiths jewellery group yesterday
provided some encouragement. Ratners has been in its closed season since
January, barring any boardroom comment on trading. But privately the company
is thought to be concerned that an acknowledged improvement in sales may not
justify the recent share price rise. Ratners has previously said it expects
its results in 1993 to mirror last year's Pounds 25m loss.
Inevitable speculation has raised hopes that the company will unveil some
pleasant surprise with its results, either a disposal or a better than
expected turnround in trading. This has also been linked to rumours in New
York that Zale, the US jeweller, may soon emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection on the back of improved business.
Other suggestions, however, have been that Ratners may take the opportunity
of the share rise to make a rights issue, a necessary step in its recovery
in the opinion of some stores specialists.
