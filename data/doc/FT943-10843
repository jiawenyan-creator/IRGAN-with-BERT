FT  03 AUG 94 / General strike halts much of Argentina
A one-day general strike called by Argentina's opposition parties and trade
unions, to protest at the government's free market economic policies, failed
to bring the country to a complete halt yesterday, but disrupted activity in
the capital, Buenos Aires, and seriously affected the interior of the
country.
About half the buses in Buenos Aires stayed off the streets. Although bus
and underground services ran normally, there were far fewer passengers than
usual.
However, in the city centre, it was business was usual.
Mr Victor de Gennaro, leader of the ATE public sector union, said: 'This
strike is a warning to the government to temper its arrogance and pay
attention to all sectors of society. It is a warning over falling wages, the
crisis of regional economies and the plague of unemployment.'
Reports from other cities indicated stronger support for the strike. Most
schools, shops, banks and factories in the industrial city of Rosario were
closed.
The strike was also successful in Cordoba, the cradle of Argentina's car
industry and governed by the opposition Radical party. Although the
metalworkers' union at the city's two car plants decided not to support the
stoppage, strike organisers claimed high levels of absenteeism.
This was the second general strike since President Carlos Menem took office
in 1989.
On Monday, the president declared the strike illegal, allowing companies to
sack employees who had stayed away from work.
