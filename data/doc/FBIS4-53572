  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Bank of Japan [BOJ] Governor 
Yasushi Mieno on Friday [20 May] repeated his earlier view that 
the Japanese economy is in a delicate stage. 
  The central bank chief told the Budget Committee of the 
House 
of Councilors that the Japanese economy has been showing some 
signs of firmness since the beginning of the year, especially 
related to consumer spending. 
  However, he said, "there is a need to closely watch whether 
these signs can be sustained and spread to other sectors." 
  Mieno said the current state of the economy is different 
from 
a similar state the economy was in spring last year in that 
inventory cuts and restructuring have been more pronounced this 
time around. 
  He said that dampening factors remain, however, such as the 
still unhealthy balance sheets of financial institutions. 
  Mieno was responding to questions by Kiyoharu Ishiwata, a 
member of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
