FT  23 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Director resigns at NHL
A BOARDROOM dispute at National Home Loans, the troubled mortgage and
consumer finance group, has led to the resignation of Mr Ken Lewis, the
group's operations director.
Mr Lewis, who had been with NHL since it was established in 1986, was in
charge of marketing, product development and services at the group. He is
understood to have found it difficult to work with Mr Jonathan Perry, a
former director of Morgan Grenfell, who took over as chairman and chief
executive a month ago.
A three line statement from NHL on Friday night said that Mr Lewis had
resigned to pursue other interests. His departure brings the number of
executive directors on NHL's seven-member board down to three. No
replacement has been appointed at this stage.
NHL, once a leading UK mortgage lender, incurred losses of Pounds 47.9m last
year. It has been in the doldrums since July when its banking subsidiary had
to be rescued by a Pounds 200m cash lifeboat from the high street clearers
led by the Bank of England.
