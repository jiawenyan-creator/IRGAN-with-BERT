FT  12 JUN 92 / Letter: Selectivity factor in schools
Sir, John Authers's interesting article on school fees funding ('Hard
arithmetic of school fees', June 6) attempts to assess value for money in
choosing a school and mentions several factors relevant to a school's
performance, including teaching quality and resources.
But he omits the most important: how academically selective a school is in
its pupil intake. That is unfortunate, since it leads him to make largely
spurious comparisons between highly selective day schools and boarding
schools, most of which have a broader intake.
