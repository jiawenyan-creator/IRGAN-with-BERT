FT  05 MAY 94 / DoT launches crackdown on non-payment of road tax
A Department of Transport inspector questions a motorist as part of a
national campaign to crack down on non-payment of vehicle road tax. The
campaign, which started in London yesterday and will move to other large
cities, aims to cut the estimated Pounds 145m lost annually through tax
evasion. In the 12 months to March this year 455,000 evaders paid
out-of-court settlements or were successfully prosecuted. Private motorists
and motorcyclists without a tax disc face fines of up to Pounds 1,000.
