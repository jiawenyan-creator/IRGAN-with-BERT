FT  03 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Legality of EU television duties
questioned
Malaysia, China, Korea, Singapore and Thailand are asking lawyers to look
into a decision by the European Commission to impose duties on televisions
sold in the European market, writes Emma Tucker in Brussels
The decision was announced at the weekend after a year-long investigation
into allegations that these countries were 'dumping' their goods in Europe,
or selling them at prices below those in their home markets. The commission
argues there will be no 'dramatic' increase in prices from the duties, which
range from as little as 3.1 per cent to 29.8 per cent. The investigation was
triggered by complaints from six European producers: Thomson of France,
Dutch electronics group Philips, Grundig, and Nokia of Germany, Bang &amp;
Olufsen of Denmark, and Italy's Seleco.
Its findings showed the market share of the five countries under
investigation had increased from 9.9 per cent in 1989 to 19.6 per cent in
1992. Over the same period, in spite of the fact that the market was
growing, the EU industry's share had dropped from 36 to 28 per cent.
