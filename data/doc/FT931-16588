FT  06 JAN 93 / Homes 'undervalued' for council tax: Institute of British
Geographers Conference
THE GOVERNMENT has systematically undervalued properties in its
classification of households for the new council tax, according to an
academic study released yesterday.
Mr Paul Longley of Bristol University and Mr Gary Higgs of Cardiff
University told the annual conference of the Institute of British
Geographers in London they had found substantial variations between the
value of houses measured by asking price and the valuation bands issued to
councils last month.
Their study, based on asking prices for 46,000 properties in inner Cardiff,
found that 27 per cent of properties had been undervalued and placed in the
band below the one their prices would suggest. Only 13 per cent of
properties had been placed in a higher band.
The council tax rates are likely to be used as a basis for estimates by
mortgage valuers and estate agents and so are likely to contribute to
further house price deflation.
The patterns also suggest that council tax valuations - which are supposed
to be based on capital values of houses - may have been based partly on
figures in the old rates registers - which were based on estimated rental
values.
The findings suggest that the tax will be a greater burden in suburbs than
in inner-city areas.
Within the inner cities, estimates suggest that small terraced houses will
pay about the same in council tax as the amount they paid under the old
rates system. Property in gentrified areas will pay less tax than rates.
