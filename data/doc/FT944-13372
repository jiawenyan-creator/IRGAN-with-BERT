FT  28 OCT 94 / Italian cabinet unable to agree
Italy's cabinet failed at marathon talks yesterday to agree on its
appointments to the European Union's new executive Commission in a further
sign of divisions in the coalition government. Health Minister Raffaele
Costa, emerging from nine hours of talks, said ministers decided to leave
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to settle the matter personally.
Italy, is the only EU member state not to have named its two appointees and
is running out of time. Commission president Jacques Santer of Luxembourg
plans to meet his team and assign portfolios on Saturday. Mr Berlusconi said
this week Mr Mario Monti, head of Italy's most prestigious business school,
had accepted one of the posts. But the cabinet, is split over who should
accompany him. Yesterday's meeting considered at least four candidates.
