  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has 
stressed that Jordan has always backed just, comprehensive, and 
lasting peace and will continue to support it and that Jordan is 
working to establish stability in the region. 
  During his meeting with German Labor Minister Norbert Bluem 
at the Prime Ministry today, the prime minister said the 
negotiations should inevitably lead to a comprehensive and real 
peace. He added: We agreed to negotiate on the essence and not 
the form, and we agreed that the issue of security should be 
discussed with the withdrawal from the occupied territories, the 
issue of economy with that of the refugees and the displaced, 
and the issue of water with the plans on environment and energy, 
and we have announced that we are ready to discuss all these 
problems at the same time. 
  The prime minister pointed out that Jordan has endured the 
most from the Gulf war and that it has sustained a sizable loss. 
He said: I personally visited New York and explained to the 
officials there the pressure and harassment to which Jordan is 
being submitted through the blockade imposed on the port of 
al-'Aqabah and the momentous losses resulting from this 
harassment, as well as the other consequences sustained by the 
Jordanian economy, which has been unjustifiably punished. 
  Dr. al-Majali said: We hope that Germany will support 
Jordan's right to have the blockade lifted from the al-'Aqabah 
Port and help it overcome its problems by alleviating the 
tribulations of the citizens and the trade sectors as a result 
of the price hikes caused by the transportation costs and the 
blockade imposed on the port. [passage omitted]
