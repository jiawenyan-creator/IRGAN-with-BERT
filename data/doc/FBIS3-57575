  [Text] Moscow January 26 TASS -- Konstantin Zatulin, 
chairman of the State Duma's committee on CIS affairs, appealed 
to Russian parliamentarians on Wednesday to refrain from trips 
to the Crimea until after the second round of presidential 
elections there next Sunday. 
  He said such trips might provoke a "flare up of political 
passions" in and around this semi-autonomous republic within 
Ukraine, even though "nobody wants to steal Crimea from Ukraine 
overnight", or infringe on the right of "the Crimean people to 
express their will in deciding the peninsula's status". 
  Ukraine fears what it sees as an "unfavourable outcome" 
after 
the first round of the Crimean presidential elections on January 
16 revealed that a candidate representing the pro-Russian 
circles was in the lead. 
  Zatulin said Ukraine was unlikely to call off the second 
round of elections, a conclusion he drew after two days of talks 
with the Russian ambassador to Kiev and the Ukrainian ambassador 
to Moscow. "There is no danger that the second round of the 
presidential elections in the Crimea can be aborted", Zatulin 
said. 
  However, as a precaution, the Ukrainian parliament last week 
voted for an amendment to the Constitution giving Kravchuk power 
to annul any decision made in Ukraine or its "Crimean autonomy" 
if it runs counter to Ukraine's Constitution, laws or 
presidential decrees. In other words, Leonid Kravchuk is 
authorized to veto an unwelcome outcome of the presidential 
elections in the Crimea.
