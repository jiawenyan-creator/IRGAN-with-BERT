FT  07 NOV 94 / Reagan has Alzheimer's
Former US President Ronald Reagan has released a handwritten letter
informing Americans that he is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a
progressive neurological disorder involving memory loss and personality
change.
The 83-year-old Republican said he and his wife, Nancy, decided to make the
news public to 'promote greater awareness of this condition' and to
'encourage clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are
affected by it'. No effective drug exists to arrest the mental and physical
decline of the condition. Mr Reagan's letter - a moving farewell to
Americans from the man know as 'the great communicator' - said the disease
imposed a heavy burden on the families of those afflicted. 'I only wish
there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience,' he
said. 'When the time comes, I am confident that with your help she will face
it with faith and courage. . . I now begin the journey that will lead me to
the sunset of my life. I know that for America there will always be a bright
dawn ahead.'
