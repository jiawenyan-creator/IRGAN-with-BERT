METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MORE FLEXIBILITY IN SCHOOL CHOICE VOTED 
New permit policies that will allow parents in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District greater flexibility to choose their children's schools were 
unanimously approved Monday by the Board of Education. 
The newly adopted policies expand the number of students eligible for transfers 
to schools closer to child-care facilities and for the first time allow 
transfers to district schools closer to where parents work. 
The job-related transfers will be issued only to students whose parents work 
full time, can show proof of employment and have a note from their employer 
that gives permission for the parents to go to the school in case of an 
emergency. 
Under the new policy, the child-care transfer permits can be renewed annually 
until a student finishes the highest grade at the school to which the transfer 
was granted, but parents will be required to verify each year their need for 
the permit. 
Also included are guidelines to ensure that the transfers do not cause a school 
to become racially segregated.
