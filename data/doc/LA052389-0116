METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: O. J. SIMPSON ENTERS NO-CONTEST PLEA 
Actor and former pro football star O.J. Simpson pleaded no contest Monday to a 
charge that he beat his wife at their Brentwood home New Year's Day. 
Simpson, 41, entered the plea to one count of spousal battery through his 
attorney, Howard Weitzman, in West Los Angeles Municipal Court, said city 
attorney's spokesman Mike Qualls. 
The plea is not an admission of guilt, but allows the defendant to be judged as 
guilty. A no-contest plea allows a defendant to deny guilt in another legal 
proceeding. 
Simpson is accused of slapping, kicking and threatening to kill his wife, 
Nicole, in the New Year's Day argument. 
Sentencing is set for Wednesday in West Los Angeles Municipal Court. The 
maximum penalty is a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
