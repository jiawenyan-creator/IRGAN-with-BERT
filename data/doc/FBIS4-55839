Included in Coupon Privatization"] 
  [Text] Bratislava -- Slovak arms factories will not be 
included in the second wave of coupon privatization, Ivan 
Kovacik, director of the engineering section at the Slovak 
Ministry of Economy, said. 
  Proposals for the privatization of arms factories are to be 
submitted to the government only by the end of July, whereas the 
list of companies for coupon privatization is to be ready in the 
second half of May, he added. According to Kovacik, the volume 
of weapons production has dropped to one-tenth of the 1989 
level. Arms factories' production worth 2 billion Slovak 
korunas, consisting entirely of spare parts, was exported last 
year. Although more than 20 companies in Slovakia trade in 
weapons, their activity is not being coordinated in any way, he 
noted.
