FT  21 AUG 92 / Manufacturers boost spending
MANUFACTURERS increased investment in plant, machinery and buildings by 3
per cent in the second quarter of this year compared with the first three
months, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
If confirmed, this would be the first quarterly rise since the first quarter
of 1990, before the start of the recession, and underline the modest
increase in confidence reported by many businesses earlier this year.
Although the numbers hint at the possibility of an economic upturn later
this year, the City was sceptical, arguing that these particular CSO figures
are erratic and subject to revision.
The CSO seasonally-adjusted figures show investment totalled Pounds 2.48bn
at 1985 prices in the first quarter, after Pounds 2.4bn in the first
quarter. The figures for the second quarter remain 3 per cent down on the
corresponding period last year.
Separately, the CSO said manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers cut stocks
of raw materials, finished goods and components by Pounds 1.09bn in the
second quarter, after a cut of Pounds 385m in the previous quarter.
The data indicate that many businesses accelerated the rate at which they
reduced stocks during the first half, possibly because of a deterioration in
optimism about the economy.
However, interpretation is made difficult by the notorious inaccuracy of
stock figures. The CSO said the greatest amount of stock cuts involved
wholesalers, which reduced the value of these items by Pounds 492m after a
cut of Pounds 105m in the first three months.
Retailers' stocks fell by Pounds 415m, after an increase of Pounds 416m in
the first quarter, while manufacturers reduced stocks by Pounds 186m, after
a fall of Pounds 696m previously.
