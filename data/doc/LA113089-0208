SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SOUTH PASADENASOUTH PASADENA; 
CHINESE BOOKS DONATED 
Members of the Lions Club International in Taipei, Taiwan, have donated about 
700 Chinese books to the South Pasadena Library. 
"The books have been circulating like crazy," children's librarian Maida Wong 
said. 
The Chinese-American Club of South Pasadena helped to arrange the donation, 
according to Lisa Yang, one of the club's directors. The Lions gave the 
Chinese-American Club about 2,000 books, and the group donated some of the 
fiction, nonfiction and children's books to the library. The remaining 1,300 
books, she said, will probably be used by the club's Chinese language school in 
South Pasadena. 
To celebrate the gift, the library on Nov. 18 held a demonstration of Chinese 
brush painting and an exhibition of Chinese paintings. 
Last year, the Taipei Lions donated 10,000 Chinese books to the Monterey Park 
library, resulting in a controversy over whether the public library's 
foreign-language collection would overshadow the English-language books. In the 
case of South Pasadena, Yang said, the community and library were pleased to 
receive the books.
