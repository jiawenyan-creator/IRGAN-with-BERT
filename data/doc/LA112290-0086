VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME; 
CARPENTER TO REPLACE WRIGHT AS MAYOR 
In a dramatic shift, the Port Hueneme City Council moved veteran Councilman 
Orvene Carpenter into the mayor's job Wednesday night, ousting Dorill B. 
Wright, mayor for nearly 17 years. 
Although the council removed Wright from the board's top job, members voted 4 
to 0 to name him "mayor emeritus." The honorary title will take effect when 
Wright leaves the council.
