JUBILANT: Thirty years ago, Margarite Chamorro de Folano Rose left Nicaragua, 
just a doll in her hand. . . . With the upset victory of her aunt, Nicaraguan 
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro (A1), Rose now is contemplating her 
first visit home. "I didn't think she would live till the elections -- I 
thought she would have been assassinated," said the 40-year-old Newport Beach 
real estate agent. Rose said her aunt now has "a chance to turn that place 
around." Kristina Lindgren and Mark Pinsky
