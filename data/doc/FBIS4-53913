liaison officer of the Panmunjom mission of the Korean People's 
Army [KPA], had a contact with U.S. Lt. Col. Flury here today. 
  At the contact, the chief liaison officer of the KPA lodged 
a 
stern protest with the U.S. Forces side against the massive 
shipment of Patriot missiles and other new-type weapons into 
South Korea and accelerated reinforcement of Armed Forces in the 
Demilitarized Zone which lead the situation on the Korean 
peninsula to the brink of war, and strongly urged it to 
immediately stop the reckless military action. 
  He said the grave military situation on the Korean peninsula 
urgently requires the establishment of a new peace arrangement. 
  He notified the U.S. Forces side that with a view to 
preventing a war on the Korean peninsula and establishing the 
peace arrangement, the supreme command of the KPA had instituted 
the Panmunjom mission of the KPA as a new negotiating body 
replacing the Military Armistice Commission [MAC] and appointed 
Lt. Gen. Yi Chan-pok its chief, Senior Col. Pak Yim-su deputy 
chief, Col. Yu Yong-chol chief liaison officer and Lt. Col. Sin 
Kun-song liaison officer.
