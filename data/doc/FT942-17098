FT  07 APR 94 / France looking for jobs boost
Direct foreign investment in France last year will create or save some
15,500 jobs, Mr Daniel Hoeffel, the French local government minister, said
yesterday. European companies, led by the Germans and the Belgians,
accounted for 60 per cent of jobs created or sustained by foreign
investment, with American companies, long the prime investors in France,
dropping to 15 per cent, the same share as Asian companies. A sharp drop in
new jobs created by foreign investment from 1992 to 1993 was offset by
foreign investors taking over declining companies, and maintaining
employment.
