STATE; 
JACKPOT SOARING TO $40 MILLION 
Wednesday's "Lotto 6/53" jackpot may reach $40 million since no one picked all 
six winning numbers in Saturday night's game to claim the top prize, lottery 
officials said today. 
Saturday night's unclaimed jackpot was $32.1 million. 
Five tickets had five of the selected numbers plus the bonus number. Those 
tickets, each worth $198,178, were sold in Fountain Valley, Ontario, San Diego, 
Santa Paula and Pleasanton. Another 86 tickets had five of the winning numbers, 
and 10,557 had four. Those tickets are each worth $5,327 and $85, respectively.
