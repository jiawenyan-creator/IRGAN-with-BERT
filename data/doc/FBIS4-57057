  [Excerpt] Yesterday, a Huallaga Front patrol captured a 
Shining Path leader. He is providing valuable information about 
the whereabouts of the "Red Sea" terrorist battalion. This 
group was located in the Yanajanca valley and surrounding areas. 
The arrested terrorist is also giving information on the 
location of a hideout used by high-ranking Shining Path 
political and logistic commanders. 
  The wounded terrorist was identified as Ely Puertas 
Dominguez, alias comrade "John." Yesterday, his right arm was 
operated on for the third time. He is recovering well at the 
intensive care unit of the Tingo Maria hospital. 
  Puertas told EXPRESO that the "Red Sea" battalion has nearly 
300 members, most of whom are civilians recruited by force. 
Each column is made up of 50 individuals. "There were 25 
individuals in my column, but our ranks increased to 45 after we 
recruited inhabitants from a local settlement with death 
threats. Many of them were taken from their homes naked and by 
force." 
  Puertas revealed that there is a group of hired killers in 
the "Red Sea" battalion and that they are responsible for 
murdering the families of members who run away. The arrested 
terrorist said Shining Path members are hungry and thirsty 
because they do not have food. 
  Puertas said: "The fighters eat only yucca and bananas. Many 
of them are weak, sick with tuberculosis. They want to leave 
but are unable to do so because their lives and the lives of 
their families are at risk," [passage omitted]
