FT  28 APR 93 / The Lex Column: A measure of confidence
To some extent economic recovery was always a matter of confidence. The
latest CBI survey suggests the trick might be working. The leap in business
optimism was the greatest for a decade. Not surprisingly that translates
into expectations of increased orders and output over the next four months.
One has to assume that these hopes will be - more or less - fulfilled. With
the government busy talking the economy up ahead of the Newbury by-election,
though, it is all the more necessary to guard against overlooking the
weaknesses that are also apparent from the survey.
There is no sign of restocking, while the balance of respondents reported
that domestic deliveries actually fell in the first four months of the year.
One would not expect a rush to invest when 63 per cent of manufacturers are
still working below capacity. That more companies expect to cut rather than
increase capital spending is also food for thought, given the temporary
capital allowances introduced in last year's autumn statement and the
cash-flow benefits many can expect from the changes to the ACT rules.
That leaves a recovery dependent on consumer demand and exports, backed up
admittedly by some striking improvements in productivity. The question is
whether these will be enough to secure UK competitiveness if sterling
continues to rise and continental demand falls. The CBI thinks exports would
start to suffer if sterling rose much above DM2.60. Then the government
would face a dilemma. It has come out against further cuts in interest
rates, but intervention to hold sterling down would simply aggravate the
PSBR funding problem.
