FT  21 AUG 93 / Vauxhall to lift prices by 2.1%
VAUXHALL is to raise the prices of its cars and light commercial vehicles by
an average 2.1 per cent from Wednesday.
This is Vauxhall's second price increase this year. It raised prices by an
average 2.9 per cent in March.
The latest move to raise prices follows the announcement in July by Ford,
the UK new-car market leader, that it intended to raise prices by an average
2.5 per cent from the beginning of this week.
Ford said yesterday that it had delayed this increase by two weeks and it
would take effect from the beginning of next month.
The price increases will apply to 1994 model-year cars with changed
specifications, which will be in showrooms from next month.
The biggest change will be the fitting of an airbag on the driver's side as
standard equipment across the Ford range. Airbags will be fitted to all
Granada, Mondeo and Escort/Orion models from September. Airbags for the
Fiesta small car will follow a couple of months later.
Passenger-side airbags will be optional. Ford is the first volume carmaker
in Europe to offer driver-side airbags as standard across its range.
Car price movements have been complicated in the last year with prices being
lowered as a result of the removal of special car tax last November.
Several manufacturers have been reducing list prices, but at the same time
have cut margins to their dealers. This has in effect reduced the scope for
discounting and has often left transaction prices little changed.
Carmakers have also raised prices to reflect factors such as the devaluation
of sterling, improved equipment and the need to restore profit margins,
which have suffered in the recession.
