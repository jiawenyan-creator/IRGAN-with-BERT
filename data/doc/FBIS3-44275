  [Text] Things continue at a standstill at the Angolan peace 
talks in Lusaka, Zambia. The mediator, Alioune Blondin Beye, 
spent the whole day with the delegation from the National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] trying to bring it 
to reason. Joao Ligio reports. 
  The general and specific principles on the police force have 
already been overcome. What now remains are the modalities for 
their implementation. The government and the mediator support 
the implementation of the Bicesse Accord and say that UNITA will 
have [words indistinct] legislation. UNITA continues to be 
intransigent, however, demanding an equal percentage in the 
national police force.
