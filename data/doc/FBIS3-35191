  [Text] Amman, Feb 17 (AFP) -- Two rival Kurdish groups in 
northern Iraq signed a peace deal on Thursday, ending a bloody 
feud and pledging to work together against President Saddam 
Husayn, the opposition said. 
  The coalition Iraqi National Congress (INC) said the 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and the Kurdistan Islamic 
League (KIL) signed at its hedquarters in Salah al-Din, in the 
Kurdish-controlled north. 
  They agreed to release all prisoners and for KIL to take 
part 
in the Kurdish administration and its institutions, the INC said 
in a statement sent to AFP in the Jordanian capital. 
  At least 72 people were killed and 250 wounded in battles 
between the PUK and the pro-Iranian KIL in December and January.
