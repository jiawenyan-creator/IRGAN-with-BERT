FT  20 JUL 93 / Italian judges seek arrest of ex-minister
MAGISTRATES in Naples yesterday requested authority from the justice
minister and parliament to arrest Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, the former health
minister, on charges of forming a criminal association, illicit financing of
political parties and false billing.
The 800-page document sent to parliament, where Mr De Lorenzo enjoys
immunity as a Liberal deputy, cited 35 separate incidents of corruption that
allegedly produced L4.15bn (Pounds 1.73m) in kickbacks. This is one of the
most damning series of accusations to be levelled against a politician since
the scandals broke.
Among those levelling accusations against Mr De Lorenzo for abusing the
L100,000bn annual health budget are his former private secretary, Mr Gianni
Marone, now co-operating with the authorities, and 13 pharmaceutical
companies. The latter include three multinationals, Ciba-Geigy, Lepetit, and
Smith Kline Beecham.
The magistrates allege Mr De Lorenzo orchestrated an operation in
conjunction with senior officials that took bribes for placing
pharmaceuticals on the ministry's list of approved drugs and establishing
their pricing. His arrest was necessary to prevent interference with the
investigation, the magistrates said.
In another development yesterday, Rome magistrates arrested Mr Antonio
Galati, the administrative head of Sisde, the domestic intelligence service.
The magistrates are investigating the misappropriation of L14bn of the
organisation's funds.
