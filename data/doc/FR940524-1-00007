The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to revoke Class D
airspace at Oscoda, Michigan. The airspace at Oscoda, Michigan was corrected from Class D airspace to Class E2 airspace
because there is no operating control tower at OscodaWurtsmith Airport (59 FR 13648; March 23, 1994). The intended
effect of this proposed action is to provide an accurate description of the controlled airspace near OscodaWurtsmith
Airport, Oscoda, Michigan.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
