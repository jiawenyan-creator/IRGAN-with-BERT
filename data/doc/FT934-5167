FT  01 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Route to Irish solution
Sir, In your report, 'Chance of political deal should not be missed, say
executives' (November 29), the remarks attributed to me are accurate.
However, lest the report's introduction to my remarks and those of other
businessmen might unwittingly mislead, I wish to make clear that, in my
discussion with your interviewer, I adhered strictly to my practice of not
expressing a view on particular solutions to the Irish question in either
the short or the long term.
I was concerned to make two simple but fundamental points:
1. There are many possible political models, but each has to be judged by
the touchstone of workability. Any settlement, to be durable, must command
broad cross-community support.
2. There have been turning points in Northern Ireland which failed to turn.
This could prove to be another one unless the search for peace and stable
political arrangements is now pursued urgently to a decisive conclusion,
through a process of active negotiation involving all who are prepared to
commit themselves to the democratic process and who in their several ways
have a contribution to make to a solution.
