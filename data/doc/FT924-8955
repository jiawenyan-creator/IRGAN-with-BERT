FT  09 NOV 92 / Fighting forces trucks back
FIGHTING flared up in southern Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday, dealing a
further blow to UN efforts to bring aid overland to Sarajevo, Reuter reports
from Sarajevo.
Officials working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) said some 10 trucks heading for the besieged Bosnian capital were
forced to turn back by heavy fighting at Buna, near Mostar, south-east of
Sarajevo.
It was the third setback to a UN aid effort in 24 hours.
Members of the UN peace-keeping forces said there was still heavy shelling
between rival Serb and Croat forces around Mostar and the 57km of
strategically important road which links the city to the Croatian border.
Serb army officials, who have consistently accused Croat and Moslem forces
of opening fire in the area, lodged an official written complaint with UN
peacekeeping forces and threatened to use heavy artillery if the shooting
continued.
In their complaint the Bosnian Serb army accused Croat forces of razing
three villages and murdering women, children and old people there. The
allegation could not be independently confirmed.
