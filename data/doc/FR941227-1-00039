 

The Canada lynx is naturally low density-occurring carnivore throughout the northern boreal forests of Canada and
Alaska with its extreme southern limits occurring south of the U.S./Canada border. It was never a common species in
the contiguous U.S. because of limited suitable habitat and, except for in Maine, Montana and Washington, little
evidence of breeding populations south of the border exists. Presence of the species in most of the contiguous 48 States
corresponds to cyclic dispersals from Canada.
At the turn of the century, habitat loss due to human settlement and forest clearing reduced the range of lynx in southern
areas. However, the lynx currently occupies much of its original historic range. The Service is unable to substantiate
that trapping, hunting, poaching, and present habitat destruction threaten the continued existence of the lynx
in the wild in the contiguous U.S. Consequently, the Service finds that listing the Canada lynx in the contiguous U.S.
is not warranted. The Service's 12-month finding contains more detailed information regarding the above decisions.
