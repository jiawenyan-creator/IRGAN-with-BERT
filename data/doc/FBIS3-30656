  [Text] Prague, Feb 6 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic should 
unconditionally join a possible military solution to the Bosnia 
conflict, Ivan Medek, director of the Internal Policy Department 
in the Czech President's Office, said on the Czech independent 
television station Nova today. 
  "People are being shot at in a marketplace and negotiations 
are being held Geneva with those who are not in the least 
willing to prevent this," Medek said, adding that this absurd 
situation "is declassifying us all." 
  Medek was reacting to the shelling of a marketplace in the 
center of Sarajevo on Saturday in which 66 people were killed 
and 200 wounded.
