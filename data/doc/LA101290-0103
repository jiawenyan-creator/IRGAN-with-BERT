BRIEFLY 
CalPERS Commits to AFL-CIO Program: The AFL-CIO Pension Investment Program has 
obtained a $100-million commitment from the California Public Employee 
Retirement System. Jeff Greendorfer, West Coast representative of the labor 
program, said the investment by the state retirement system represents an 
important diversification, giving the program additional credibility with 
non-labor investors.
