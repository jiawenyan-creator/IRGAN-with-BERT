FT  06 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Euro Disney rescue with added
attraction - Other companies
The EuroDisneyland theme park will on Wednesday have an added attraction
when Euro Disney, its beleaguered operator, stages an extraordinary general
meeting for shareholders to approve proposals for its FFr13bn (Dollars
2.3bn) rescue package. However, Euro Disney, which will also announce the
terms of a FFr6bn rights issue, will for once have some good news to discuss
following last week's surprise announcement that an Arab prince plans to buy
a stake of up to 24 per cent.
