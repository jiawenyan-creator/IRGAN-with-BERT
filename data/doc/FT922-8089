FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Continental Air moves back into
the black
CONTINENTAL Airlines, one of the middle-ranking US carriers and in
bankruptcy since late 1990, reported an after-tax profit of Dollars 17.4m in
the three months to end-March.
This compared with a Dollars 181.3m loss in the same period a year earlier,
when the Gulf War-related slump in traffic volumes drove the entire industry
heavily into the red.
Continental, however, acknowledged that the profit resulted from a
non-recurring gain of Dollars 52.8m - mainly as a result of the sale of
slots and gates at New York's La Guardia airport.
It did, however, make a much-reduced operating loss of Dollars 3.7m in the
period - compared with the Dollars 138m deficit 12 months earlier. Revenues
in the first quarter rose to Dollars 1.41bn, from Dollars 1.32bn in 1991.
