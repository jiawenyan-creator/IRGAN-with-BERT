FT  14 OCT 94 / Observer: Body Shop shapes up
Body Shop has not finished collecting famous names for its letterhead.
Indeed it is seeking an 'industrial entrepreneur with wide international
experience'.
Sounds just the job for condoms-to-airlines magnate Richard Branson. He
shares Anita and Gordon Roddick's unconventional business attitudes. And as
the Virgin PR machine reminds us, Virgin and Body Shop are perhaps the UK's
only new, internationally recognised brands in the past 20 years.
Just one snag: one of Body Shop's new non-executives - appointed yesterday -
is Penny Hughes, the UK's Coca-Cola president, and soon facing a brand war
with Branson's newest product, Virgin Cola.
Surely there's a half-forgotten tribe somewhere, whose medicine man has time
on his hands?
