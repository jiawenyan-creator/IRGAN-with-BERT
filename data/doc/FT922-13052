FT  14 APR 92 / Union to ballot Tube workers
LEADERS of the RMT transport union said yesterday that they would ballot
members at London Underground over industrial action in protest at plans to
change working practices and to cut up to 5,000 jobs.
The ballot will be over the principle of management refusing to deal with
change through bargaining procedures. The union said London Underground was
trying to bring in the changes through piecemeal measures.
London Underground said it was trying to agree negotiating machinery which
would be as local as possible. It said some changes to management grades
which the union was objecting to fell outside the union's remit.
