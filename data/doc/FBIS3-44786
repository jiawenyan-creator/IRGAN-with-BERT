"Deng Xiaoping Arrives in Shanghai for Sightseeing, Plans To 
Spend the Spring Festival There"] 
  [Text] Information has once again verified that supreme 
communist leader Deng Xiaoping has already arrived in Shanghai. 
Informed sources in Shanghai disclosed that Deng Xiaoping's 
health is good, and that he has toured the municipality by car 
and listened to work reports by important party and government 
officials of the municipality. 
  The informed sources said that Deng Xiaoping, who is almost 
90 years old, arrived in Shanghai with his family half a month 
ago. Spending the Spring Festival in Shanghai has already become 
his habit. According to information, Deng Xiaoping's trip this 
time has no special significance, but he will still say some 
words on the development of Shanghai from the economic angle. 
  A certain government official in Shanghai said that Deng 
Xiaoping's visit to Shanghai is very important to the economic 
development there. He also disclosed that the central 
leadership will soon announce a more open and flexible economic 
reform policy. 
  According to sources, during his stay in Shanghai, Deng 
Xiaoping is staying mainly with his family; whether he will show 
his face on television on the eve of the Chinese New Year, like 
he did last year, will depend on the situation. 
  According to information, Deng Xiaoping will stay in 
Shanghai 
for about three months, and return to Beijing when the weather 
is warmer and flowers begin to blossom. 
  This is the sixth time Deng Xiaoping has spent the Spring 
Festival in Shanghai since 1988.
