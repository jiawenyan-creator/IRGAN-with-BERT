FT  29 OCT 93 / People: Skipper to leave Booker
Barry Skipper, chief executive of Booker's food distribution division and a
member of the main board since 1982, is leaving the food distribution and
agribusiness group at the end of the year.
Skipper, who joined the group 11 years ago, had been a rising management
star until fairly recently and was viewed as a candidate for the chief
executive's job which Jonathan Taylor vacated for the chairman's suite in
June.
In the event Charles Bowen, a former Hillsdown director, was appointed chief
executive.
Skipper's ambitions suffered a serious setback in March when Booker
announced its first fall in profits since 1980 which it mainly blamed on
problems at Booker Fitch, the catering food service business, part of
Skipper's empire.
Announcing the move yesterday Taylor said Skipper had made 'an enormous
contribution' to the development of the group's food wholesaling and
distribution operations.
However, he said that with the food distribution business accounting for
such a large proportion of the group's sales and profits, 'it is now
appropriate that it reports direct to Charles Bowen, the new chief
executive, who has wide experience of the food industry'.
Yesterday Booker declined to discuss the terms of Skipper's departure.
However, it confirmed that 'there is obviously a settlement, but we would
not wish to give details', while Skipper said: 'I now look forward to
whatever challenges are ahead for me'.
He is the second senior executive to leave recently. Booker's finance
director David Turner, who was also considered a possible candidate for the
chief executive's job, last month joined GKN.
