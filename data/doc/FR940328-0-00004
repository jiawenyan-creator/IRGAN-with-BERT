Exports to South Africa; Revision of Foreign Policy Controls 



<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 With the significant political changes underway in South Africa, the rationale for prohibiting all exports to South
African military and police entities no longer applies. The controls necessary to implement the mandatory U.N. arms
embargo against South Africa remain. In addition, restrictions on certain exports to the South African military
and police continue. This final rule amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by revising the export licensing
policy for exports to South African military and police entities in the following ways: By clarifying exemptions
from general prohibitions on certain technology and software; by revising policy to permit the consideration of
certain license applications; and by updating the list of South African military and police entities in the special
country policies and provisions. These changes, while not diminishing U.S. compliance with the U.N. mandatory embargo
against South Africa, and while maintaining U.S. ability to implement U.N. voluntary controls on certain exports
to the South African military and police, will allow U.S. businesses to begin to compete with foreign suppliers, who
are no longer bound by similar restrictions in their own countries. Thus, although it will likely result in an increase
in export license applications submitted, this rule will be generally beneficial to U.S. exporters.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



In conformity with the United Nations Security Council Resolutions of 1977 and 1986, the United States maintains
an embargo on the export of arms, munitions and military equipment, and items used in their manufacture and maintenance
to the Republic of South Africa, as well as on certain items to the South African military or police that have a military
capacity and are intended for military purposes. These controls continue. Beyond these controls related to U.N.
Security Council resolutions, the United States has also maintained an embargo on virtually all exports to South
African military and police entities. The recent historic political changes in the Republic of South Africa argue
against the continuation of such global restrictions. This rule modifies existing controls to allow certain exports
to the South African military and police under an individual validated license. For example, applications to export
food, medicine, or items to meet emergency humanitarian needs, prevent acts of unlawful interference with international
civil aviation, or counter international narcotics trafficking will generally receive favorable consideration
on a case-by-case basis. Applications for export of items relating to arms, munitions, military equipment and their
manufacture or maintenance, or that have a military capacity and are intended for military purposes, will be subject
to either a strict or general policy of denial. All other exports will be considered on a case-by-case basis. 

Regardless of expanded opportunities to export under an individual validated license, return, repair or replacement
commodities may not be exported under General License GLR at this time. Therefore, exporters should include an allowance
for replacement parts on their original license applications. Repairs should be arranged in-country when practical,
since GLR will not be available for returning the item to South Africa after repair elsewhere, and the need for a validated
license could delay the return. 

Additionally, this rule clarifies the opportunity to use General License GTDU for exports destined to South African
military and police entities of sales data that are the minimum necessary to support a proposal; operation technical
data that are the minimum necessary to operate equipment authorized for export; or software updates (bug fixes) that
do not enhance the capabilities of the initially authorized package. While such exports have been allowed under the
provisions of 779.4(e), the availability of GTDU for these shipments was obscured by 771.2(c)(11),
which broadly prohibits use of general licenses for exports to South African military and police entities. This rule
clarifies the exemption of sales data, operation data and software updates from the general prohibitions. 

General License GIT may now be used for shipments in transit through the United States destined to the Republic of South
Africa, provided that the commodities are not related to arms and munitions or destined for military and police entities.
