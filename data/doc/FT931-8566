FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Burns Philp up 32% at half-term
BURNS Philp, the Australian food and hardware group, yesterday announced a
32 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 54.5m (USDollars 37m) for the
six months ended December, on sales up 17 per cent to ADollars 1.35bn.
The group said its North American consumer foods and European yeast
operations performed 'particularly strongly'. The recently-acquired
Durkee-French spice business in the US also made a 'significant'
contribution.
Mr Andrew Turnbull, managing director, said the group was 'pretty happy'
with the result. He forecast an improvement on last year's full-year net
earnings of ADollars 101m.
The board raised the dividend from 8 cents to 8.5 cents, helping to maintain
the shares at a peak ADollars 4.08 on the Australian Stock Exchange, despite
a weak market.
Burns Philp said that two thirds of pre-tax profits were contributed by the
food operations in North and South America, which reported a 66 per cent
improvement in operating earnings to ADollars 65.9m.
Most of the improvement was contributed by Durkee-French, purchased last
year for ADollars 113m, which recorded pre-tax profits of ADollars 18.4m.
The group said the division also gained from improved productivity and
higher returns from its Argentine operations.
The food ingredients businesses in the Asia/Pacific region, which includes
Australia, raised operating earnings by 25 per cent to ADollars 20.9m,
largely as a result of the benefits of rationalisation.
However, Burns Philp said pre-tax returns from its BBC Hardware division
fell by 11 per cent to ADollars 17.9m, mainly because of high unemployment
and low consumer confidence in Australia.
