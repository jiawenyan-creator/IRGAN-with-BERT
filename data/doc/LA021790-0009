PROTEST DISRUPTS BUSH'S SPEECH 
When Mary Bent Wehrli, representing the Southern California Interfaith Task 
Force on Central America, Michael Breault, a Jesuit brother, and others stated, 
"You are killing children in El Salvador . . . You profess to be a man of God . 
. . You profess to be an Episcopalian . . . You killed my brothers," they 
proved that the truth can rise again: anywhere! 
Republicans and Democrats in Congress are just as responsible for this shocking 
"policy" as Bush. 
But Bush is in a position to stop it now. He said, "Pretty tough," as the 
protesters were manhandled. Before the "tough" tolls for him, I submit: 
 Here lies the body of President Blow 
 Who died maintaining the status quo 
 Used our taxes for hell in El Salvador 
 Ignored Good Book Proverbs 24:24.
