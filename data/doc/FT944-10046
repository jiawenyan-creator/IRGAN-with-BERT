FT  12 NOV 94 / International Company News: Japan's carmakers begin recovery
Japan's carmakers are seeing a fragile recovery in domestic demand,
demonstrated in half-year results published yesterday, and are confident of
continuing,stronger demand in the second half.
Non-consolidated results from Mitsubishi Motors, Mazda and Fuji Heavy
Industries - which makes Subaru cars - reflected the varying degrees to
which vehicle producers have been able to take advantage of a recovery in
the Japanese market.
Mitsubishi Motors, which has benefited tremendously from the popularity of
its recreational vehicles, achieved a 20 per cent increase in operating
profit, to Y22.9bn (Dollars 233.7m) from Y19.2bn a year ago, on flat sales
of Y1,225.2bn compared with Y1,216.7bn.
Recurring profits, however, were up only 1 per cent at Y17.4bn from Y17.2bn,
mainly as a result of lower non-operating income, such as interest payments.
Net profit was 19 per cent down at Y8.1bn from Y10bn because of higher
taxes. The interim dividend was held at Y3.5 a share.
The company expects the domestic recovery to continue, and for the full year
is forecasting increased revenues of Y2,620bn, higher recurring profits of
Y45bn and net profits of Y18bn.
Mazda, which is 24.5 per cent-owned by Ford of the US, on the other hand,
suffered recurring losses of Y28.6bn, which was approaching double the
Y15.5bn loss it incurred in the same period last year.
Sales at Mazda, which has been slow to take advantage of Japan's boom in
recreational vehicles, were down 2 per cent to Y858.9bn from Y876.1bn. Net
losses widened to Y28.9bn from Y15.8bn. It blamed the overall decline in
sales mainly to sluggish demand in the Japanese passenger car market in the
first part of the half.
However, Mazda, which relies on exports for 58 per cent of sales, was also
hit by the downturn in European sales, which offset a strong increase in
shipments to the US.
On the brighter side, the company began to benefit from the launch during
the period of its new Familia and Capella models, which have helped boost
sales. The Familia, in particular, has been popular for its low sticker
price of under Y1m for some versions.
Mazda is also undergoing a rationalisation exercise which enabled it to
reduce fixed costs by Y19bn in the first half. It believes its restructuring
programme, and the continuation the Japanese recovery, will enable it to
reduce losses in the second half and return to profitability in the next
fiscal year.
The company is forecasting increased sales of Y1,790bn against last year's
Y1,768.7bn, lower recurring losses of Y33bn compared with Y44.1bn and a net
loss of Y33bn, down from Y44.2bn.
Fuji Heavy Industries, noted for its four-wheel-drive cars and a popular
estate car, Legacy, increased sales strongly. However, it suffered a
downturn in non-operating profits, which put pressure on its performance at
the recurring level.
Fuji Heavy reported a recurring loss of Y2.3bn, down from a Y19bn loss, in
spite of a 13 per cent rise in sales to Y402.9bn compared with Y356.6bn.
There was also a return to the black at the operating level, with Y2.5bn in
operating profits against a Y15.8bn loss. The company passed its interim
dividend.
For the full year, Fuji expects sales of Y830bn, recurring profits of Y3bn
and net profits of Y3bn.
