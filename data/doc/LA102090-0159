VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD; 
COUNCIL APPROVES CHILD-CARE CENTER 
Plans for the construction of a child-care center at the Oxnard Financial Plaza 
were approved by the Oxnard City Council this week although the city Planning 
Commission rejected the proposal last month. 
The center will be built next to the Financial Plaza Hilton on Esplanade Drive. 
The facility's 11,370-square-foot building and 20,800-square-foot playground 
area will accommodate up to 208 children. 
The Planning Commission voted 4 to 2 against the plans because the site is next 
to the Ventura Freeway and subject to its pollution and noise. 
Members questioned how easily emergency vehicles could reach the building, 
which would be in the corner of the parking lot. 
Councilwoman Ann Johs, who appealed the commission's ruling before the City 
Council, said children would not be on the playground during rush hours 
breathing the worst of the exhaust. She also pointed out that the section of 
the freeway running by the building is raised, so much of the smog would pass 
overhead. 
Johs dismissed doubts about emergency vehicle access. "The Fire Department 
hasn't raised that concern," she said. 
The center will be owned by Martin V. Smith Inc., which built the Financial 
Plaza complex and has its offices there. 
It is expected to open by the end of next summer, said a company spokesman. 
Parents may use the child-care center even if they don't work in the office 
complex. KIM KASH
