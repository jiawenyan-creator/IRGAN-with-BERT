FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Emerging markets boost Coca-Cola
Strong growth in emerging markets helped Coca-Cola, the US soft drinks
company, report a 23 per cent increase in net profits to Dollars 708m in its
third quarter - its biggest percentage increase in quarterly earnings in
four years.
The company had indicated last month that its figures would be better than
usual when it announced that its estimates of volumes sold during the
quarter were significantly ahead of analysts' expectations.
Yesterday it said that volume growth had been led by a 17 per cent surge in
international unit case volume, 3 percentage points higher than it had
predicted last month. US volume growth was 6 per cent, as expected,
producing an average worldwide increase of 13 per cent.
Sales revenue grew by 23 per cent to Dollars 4.5bn, reflecting the increased
volumes, strategic price increases and favourable exchange rate movements.
Earnings per share, boosted by company share repurchases, rose by 25 per
cent to 55 cents.
The fastest areas of growth came in new and emerging markets such as eastern
and central Europe, the Middle East, India and China. The company's
north-east Europe/Middle East group increased volumes by 43 per cent.
Volumes in Japan and Europe recovered from a poor third quarter last year,
rising 26 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. In the UK, volumes rose 21
per cent.
