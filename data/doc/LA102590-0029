NEW 644-MILE SECTION OF GREAT WALL FOUND IN NORTHEAST CHINA 
Archeologists have found a new section of China's famous Great Wall, extending 
its eastern end more than 600 miles to the border with North Korea, official 
reports said Wednesday. 
The reports in the English-language China Daily and in the Beijing Daily said 
the finding coincided with historical records. 
Chinese archeologists conducted a field survey from February to July in 
northeast China's Liaoning province, where they found remnants of the wall, 
including 12 beacon towers, important tablets dating back to the 14th to 17th 
centuries, ceramics and weapons, the reports said. 
The new section adds 644 miles to the wall, which previously was said to be 
about 1,500 miles long. 
Previously, the eastern end of the Great Wall was thought to be the seacoast 
town of Shanhaiguan, in Hebei province at the border with Liaoning. 
The new section of the wall continues from Shanhaiguan, zigzagging northeast 
through Liaoning province, passing through Shenyang and then south to the 
border city of Dandong. 
The report did not say what condition the new section of wall is in. Most of 
the rest of the Great Wall, except for sections that have been renovated as 
tourist sites, is little more than heaps of dirt and rubble.
