OFFENSIVE LINEMEN CHEEK, BRANDOM SUSPENDED FIVE WEEKS FOR STEROID USE 
Offensive linemen Louis Cheek of the Dallas Cowboys and rookie John Brandom of 
the Phoenix Cardinals were suspended Monday for violating the NFL's policy on 
anabolic steroids and related substances. 
A statement by the NFL said the action was taken after the players tested 
positive in training camp physicals. 
Cheek and Brandom, who both signed as free agents, are suspended for the next 
two weeks. If their systems are then shown to be clear, they can resume 
practicing and playing. 
They will also be suspended without pay and placed on the reserve-non-football 
injury list for the first three weeks of the regular season.
