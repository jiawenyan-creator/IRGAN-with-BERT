  [Text] Lhasa, 31 May (XINHUA) -- These reporters learned 
from a forum recently held by the Tibet Autonomous Region to 
mark the 10th anniversary of the promulgation of the current 
conscription law that the region has sent nearly 10,000 fine 
youths to serve in the People Liberation Army [PLA] over the 
past 10 years. Last winter, Tibet sent a batch of new Tibetan 
soldiers inland for the first time. These soldiers share the 
important responsibility with fine young men and women of other 
nationalities of safeguarding the motherland. 
  Since the Conscription Law was promulgated, the Government 
of 
the Tibet Autonomous Region has successively formulated 
regulations such as the Detailed Rules for Carrying Out the 
Conscription Work and the Detailed Rules for Militia Affairs. 
It has launched extensive campaigns to publicize the 
Conscription Law across the entire region, thus significantly 
enhancing people's awareness of national defense. During the 
conscription period every year, masses of young people from 
urban and rural areas who are old enough to join the Army rush 
to enlist. The soldiers sent to the PLA by Tibet over the past 
10 years are all well-qualified, and none of them quit. Having 
joined the Army in different periods, excellent sons and 
daughters of Tibetan people right now are serving in various PLA 
units. Tibetan officers ranking from platoon leader to general 
can be found in the PLA. Moreover, in the past 10 years, 
governments at all levels in the Tibet Autonomous Region have 
made arrangements for more than 9,000 retired compulsory 
servicemen and for more than 460 soldiers who were transferred 
to civilian work. These demobilized and transferred veterans 
are playing an important role in promoting various undertakings 
of local economic construction and national development.
