FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Tenneco reduces offering of Case
shares
Tenneco has revised plans for an initial public offering of its Case farm
machinery subsidiary. It has reduced the size of the offering to 25 per cent
of Case common stock, or 17.5m shares.
When Tenneco announced in April that it would sell a portion of Case to the
public, the US energy and industrial group said the offering would represent
at least 35 per cent of Case share capital.
Mr Dana Mead, Tenneco's chairman, said the offering was reduced because
stock market valuations for companies in machinery and other cyclical
industries had weakened since the Case spin-off was announced.
'Since the company's performance thus far in 1994 has been strong, we are
reluctant to sell more than 25 per cent at these valuation levels,' he said.
In its preliminary prospectus for the offering, Tenneco set a price range of
Dollars 19 to Dollars 22 a share.
Wall Street analysts said that range was within expectations, though it is
short of the Dollars 25 a share some had suggested in April.
Tenneco said it expected the spin-off to bring in Dollars 335m-Dollars 385m.
This compares with the Dollars 500m anticipated when the deal was announced.
Tenneco intends to invest the proceeds of the sale to enhance its automotive
parts and natural gas businesses. Case is Tenneco's largest division, and
Tenneco intends to retain majority control of the company.
Mr Mead did not rule out a second offering of Case shares. He said Tenneco
was reviewing its options for issuing additional Case shares later this
year.
Tenneco's shares did not respond to the news and stood Dollars  1/8 higher
at Dollars 48 on New York at midday.
Case achieved first-quarter operating income of Dollars 81m on sales of
Dollars 1bn, representing nearly a third of the Tenneco group's
first-quarter sales and operating income.
