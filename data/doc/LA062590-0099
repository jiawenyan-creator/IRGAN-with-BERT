ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; 
CITY COUNCIL TO HEAR APPEAL ON RIDGELINE 
The fate of the city's last undeveloped ridgeline may be decided at tonight's 
City Council meeting, when the council hears an appeal brought by one of its 
own members. 
The Planning Commission approved the controversial plan to build 719 homes on 
Naciente Ridge last month, but an appeal was filed May 25 by Councilman William 
S. Craycraft, who said he was worried about a geological survey that indicated 
potential landslide areas on the 421-acre site. 
"I don't think (filing the appeal) is any big deal," he said. "I just want to 
be certain there are no problems" with slope stability. 
The first public hearing on the proposed development in April drew 300 people, 
and officials say they expect heavy attendance at tonight's meeting. 
The project is being proposed by the Mission Viejo Co., which has offered to 
build several athletic parks for the city's many youth sports organizations and 
to donate more than 200 acres of open space in return for the right to develop 
the ridgeline. Company officials estimate the value of the land gift and the 
parks at about $10 million. 
But homeowners living near the project site, which runs almost three miles 
parallel to Olympiad Road, say the trade-off is poor compensation for the loss 
of the city's last ridgeline. 
The Planning Commission approved the development last month, saying that its 
benefits to the community outweigh the ecological impact. 
Debate over the project is also being clouded by an agreement reached between 
the Mission Viejo Co. and Councilman Robert A. Curtis. That proposal suggested 
that approvals for Naciente Ridge development and a large-scale 
hotel/commercial complex off Crown Valley Parkway be linked to several 
concessions from the developer. FRANK MESSINA
