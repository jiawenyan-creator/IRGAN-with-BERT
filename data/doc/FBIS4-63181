  [Text] The suit filed by the procurator general's office 
against the pilots' union was heard today at the Moscow city 
court. [video shows O.A. Yegorova, captioned as member of the 
civil commission of the Moscow city court] 
  [Yegorova] The court decided that the strike, announced and 
carried out by the pilots' union of the Russian Federation, is 
illegal. In accordance with the 20 May 1991 law on procedures 
for resolving collective labor disputes, in particular Article 
12, which states that public transportation, which includes 
civil aviation, cannot settle its problems, disputes, or 
conflicts through strikes. 
  [Announcer] Union representatives, who in general agreed 
with 
the court's decision, nevertheless think that the law providing 
for such situations contains contradictions. According to the 
new Constitution of the Russian federation, they do have a right 
to strike in order to settle their labor disputes. 
  Right now pilots are discussing their demands at the Labor 
Ministry. Their main demand is an increase in pensions. 
According to the pilots' union, veteran pilots receive from the 
pension fund only one-fifth of the sum paid to the fund by the 
civil aviation department.
