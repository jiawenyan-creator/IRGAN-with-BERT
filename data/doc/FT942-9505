FT  16 MAY 94 / Berlusconi faces vote of confidence
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, sworn in as Italy's prime minister last Wednesday,
faces his first parliamentary test this week when the programme of his
right-wing government is put to a vote of confidence.
His Freedom Alliance, which won the March general elections, has an easy
majority in the chamber of deputies but needs to attract external support to
win in the senate.
Government failure to win confidence in both houses would open up a
political crisis that could lead to new elections.
Mr Berlusconi formulated last week the outlines of his programme with his
main allies - the populist Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI/National
Alliance. But he has been finalising details over the weekend after
receiving suggestions from individual ministers.
The programme is set to give priority to deregulation, tax reform and
privatisation. It will be outlined first before the senate today. Particular
attention will focus on how Mr Berlusconi chooses to tackle the issue of
privatisation. The Northern League has hinted it will seek a 30-day freeze
on all privatisation to re-examine existing procedures.
The senate vote of confidence is expected on Wednesday and that of the
chamber of deputies by the end of the week.
In the 315-seat senate, Mr Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance has 156 seats but
needs 164 to be assured of a majority. Against this there are 117 senators
in the progressive bloc and 34 belonging to the Popular party. There is a
further 'mixed group' that comprises 19 seats plus 11 life senators.
When the various parties voted for a new speaker last month, the government
candidate won by a single vote. To be assured of a comfortable working
majority, Mr Berlusconi must be able to rely on some of the former Christian
Democrat senators.
