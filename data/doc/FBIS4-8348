  [Text] The Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] will await the 
National Assembly's discussion of the interpellation of the SDS 
deputies on the government's financial policy, and if the draft 
decision that negatively assesses the government policy is not 
supported, a no-confidence vote will be proposed. This was 
decided at today's meeting of the SDS National Coordinating 
Council. 
  The behavior of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] shows 
that very little could be achieved through parliamentary 
methods, Filip Dimitrov said. However, he did not say what 
extraparliamentary actions the SDS plans to prompt the 
resignation of the cabinet and early elections. 
  At an extraordinary meeting next Wednesday [20 April] the 
chairmen of the member parties of the SDS coalition will discuss 
the SDS' strategy and tactics. The parties must propose the 
criteria according to which the future SDS deputies will be 
approved. 
  The SDS will not support the strike prepared by the 
Executive 
Committee of the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in 
Bulgaria, but it does expect the strike to facilitate the 
toppling of the cabinet.
