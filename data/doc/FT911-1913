FT  02 MAY 91 / MCC blocks women's innings
IT MAY BE 1991, but Mary-lebone Cricket Club last night voted against, as
one member put it, 'moving into the 20th, let alone into the 21st century'.
The MCC, the world's most famous cricket club and the sport's former
governing body, voted not to admit women as either full or honorary members.
Ms Rachael Heyhoe Flint, the former England women's cricket captain who
started all the fuss, did - in the words of MCC secretary Lieut-Col John
Stephenson - 'bowl a fast one'.
Encouraged by Lt-Col Stephenson's admission last year that there was nothing
in the club's constitution spec-ifically preventing women from joining, Ms
Heyhoe Flint put in a request for a membership form signed only 'R. Flint',
but backed by some weighty figures in the cricket world.
But MCC members answered Ms Heyhoe Flint with a firm defensive stroke,
rejecting by 4,727 votes to 2,371 a motion to amend the rules to allow women
members.
'The word 'chauvinist' was mentioned,' Lt-Col Stephenson said after the
meeting.
