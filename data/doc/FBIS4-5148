  [Excerpt] Vientiane -- Visiting Australian Prime Minister 
Paul Keating yesterday urged Laos, a close communist ally of 
North Korea, to help defuse nuclear tension in the Korean 
peninsular, said Foreign Minister Samsavat Lengsavat. 
  The request was raised during Keating's talks with his 
Laotian counterpart Khamtai Siphandon. Laos' response, however, 
was cautious. 
  Somsavat said despite the government's policy fostering 
world 
peace and stability, Vientiane respected countries' individual 
rights to find solutions to their own problems. 
  "We (Laos and North Korea) in fact have good relations. Our 
two countries were the victims of aggression in the past," said 
Somsavat. [passage omitted]
