FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Job cut costs hit Rand Mines
RAND MINES has blamed large retrenchment packages at Harmony gold mine, and
a weak gold price, for a second-quarter R40.9m (Dollars 15.1m) loss at its
gold division. The division made R7.3m after-tax profit in the March
quarter.
Harmony, by far the largest producer in the group, paid out R35.5m in
benefits to 6,200 retrenched employees during the quarter, as the mine took
steps to try to ensure continued profitability.
Mr John Turner, chairman of the gold division, said other factors which had
hurt profits were lower production at Harmony and Blyvooruitzicht, the two
largest producers; an inability to lift the grade to compensate for higher
costs and a lower price; and rationalisation at Blyvooruitzicht, though the
costs will only be felt this quarter.
Total gold production in the group dropped 4 per cent to 11,243kg from
11,699kg, while average price received was 2 per cent lower at R32,172 per
kg. Total underground costs at the four mines rose to R37,721 per kg from
R33,517 per kg. This was due mainly to the high retrenchment costs at
Harmony.
Mr Turner said he expected Harmony to return to profitability in the
September quarter. However, as the large June loss eliminated retained
income, surplus asset disposals would have to continue in order to bolster
cash resources. Retrenchment costs and a fall in gold production, to 5,737kg
from 6,012kg, were partly blamed for a R47m working loss, compared with R2m
profit the previous quarter.
Of the other three mines, ERPM made a working profit of R4.3m, down from
R7.1m the previous quarter, while Durban Deep turned in R968,000, compared
with R1.7m.
ERPM's huge debt burden, however, meant the mine had to pay R12.7m interest
during the quarter, leaving it with an after-tax loss of R6.07m.
Blyvooruitzicht made a R1.9m working loss, compared with R2.8m profit.
