Radar Station Operation"] 
  [Text] Riga, 23 Feb -- The board of the Democratic Party 
has adopted a statement asking the state's president and the 
Saeima [parliament] to reject the agreement which foresees the 
Skrunda radar station maintaining the status of a Russian 
military base. The Democratic Party is of the opinion that the 
agreement with Russia should foresee the dismantling of the 
Skrunda radar station and its removal from Latvian territory. 
  The statement also says that it could be acceptable to 
permit 
coordination of the schedule for dismantling and removing the 
Skrunda radar station with plans to build a new station, which 
is being supervised by international observers. This would then 
be a guarantee for the fulfillment of the terms of the agreement.
