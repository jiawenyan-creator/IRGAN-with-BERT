FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Vivat advances to Pounds 3m as recovery
gathers pace
VIVAT HOLDINGS, the Lee Cooper clothing group, announced pre-tax profits of
Pounds 3m for the 1992 year, recovering from a year-earlier loss of Pounds
678,000.
It is proposing to resume dividends with a 1p final out of earnings per
share of 3.9p (losses 1.2p)
A fall in turnover to Pounds 73.4m (Pounds 89.1m) reflected the closure of
loss-making activities. Gearing was cut to 51 per cent (73 per cent).
Mr Christopher Burnett, chairman, said: '1992 was a year of consolidation
during which we focused on our core Lee Cooper business and brand.'
By focusing on its Lee Cooper brand, Vivat expects to extend its recovery
this year. The shares closed up 12p on the day at 45p.
The company made an extraordinary provision of Pounds 541,000 on top of
Pounds 4m provided a year earlier against its liability for about 40 retail
property leases it had sold in 1988. It regained responsibility for the
leases when the purchaser, Chelsea Man, went into administrative
receivership.
The company has not yet adopted new accounting rules which restrict the use
of extraordinary items but believes its leasehold liabilities would still
qualify as extraordinary next year when the new standard is compulsory.
