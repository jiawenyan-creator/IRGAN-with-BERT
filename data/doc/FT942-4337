FT  10 JUN 94 / Campaign Diary: Will Bambi keep his cool?
Tony Blair had the grace to look a bit embarrassed about some of the anodyne
written questions read out to him by acolytes at an election rally in
Eastleigh - after all, the odds on getting through a question-and-answer
session without a hostile question, much less a barbed remark about the
leadership, must be astronomical. So were the questions vetted? Or are the
voters afraid to upset Bambi? Whatever, Blair can expect a rougher ride when
the leadership contest starts in earnest today.

A straw in the wind? With an eye on Eastleigh's British Rail maintenance
works, transport secretary John MacGregor managed to hold a by-election
press conference in the constituency without mentioning privatisation once.
Asked whether his references to 'rail reforms' were a cover for the P-word,
a defensive MacGregor said the railway sell-off was not a privatisation in
the classic sense. So much for privatisation. There was a time when
ministers would talk about little else.
