FT  05 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Industrial gas competition
Sir, David Lascelles ('Hot air rises around cool decisions', September 29)
highlights the shifting positions in the debate on the future of British
Gas. I was, however, interested to note that industrial gas consumers can
now get gas at 15 per cent less than British Gas supplies it at. Would that
this were entirely the case.
Prior to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry, the Office of Fair
Trading set a target to reduce British Gas's share of the industrial and
commercial gas market by some 60 per cent, to allow in new competitors. A
likely result of this is that the price of interruptible gas supplies may
now go up. Indeed a number of the new players in the gas market predict
this.
This results from British Gas not needing to have its future largely
governed by the price set in the interruptible market, and from the fact
that, as its overall market share shrinks, its ability to offer low-price
interruptible gas to balance demands elsewhere will also decline. Rising
interruptible gas prices will not only adversely affect much of industry, it
will also limit the spread of combined heat and power at the moment the
government is promoting its wider use to curtail carbon dioxide emissions.
A further aspect of the post-MMC process is the impact the changing nature
of the British Gas tariff market will have on the government-backed Energy
Saving Trust, whose revenue critically depends on the pricing formula for
the tariff market. The trust is a centrepiece in the government's
environmental strategy - if the tariff market is open to all comers, can we
expect new entrants to sign up to the regulatory formula which underpins the
trust's activities?
When the DTI comes to make clear its position, there will be more at stake
than competition alone.
