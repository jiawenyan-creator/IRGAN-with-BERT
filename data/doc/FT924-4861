FT  30 NOV 92 / Economics: Bad news looms on German stagflation
IMPORTANT news from Germany this week where a crop of figures on the real
economy are due for release.
The data - including third quarter gross domestic product, November
unemployment, and October industrial production - are expected to show a
stagflating economy. This will add to pressure for the Bundesbank to ease
lending rates and breathe life into European economies.
In spite of a small recovery in personal consumption in the third quarter,
German GDP will probably show another quarter on quarter fall and
unemployment is forecast to rise again.
