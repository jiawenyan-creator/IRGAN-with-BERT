FT  09 JAN 92 / Greek court sentences Arab
A Greek court yesterday sentenced a Palestinian to 18 years' imprisonment on
charges of having placed a bomb aboard a Pan-Am aircraft in 1982 that killed
a Japanese passenger, Kerin Hope reports from Athens.
Mr Mohammed Rashid, was arrested in Athens three-and-a-half years ago,
following a tip from US intelligence officials. But, instead of granting a
US request for his extradition, Greek authorities decided to try him in
Greece.
FBI agents and another Palestinian told the court that Mr Rashid belonged to
a Palestinian terrorist group, 'May 15', which used sophisticated explosive
devices assembled by one of its members.
