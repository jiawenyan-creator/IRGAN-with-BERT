FT  10 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: General Accident
Yesterday's interim figures from General Accident show just why Commercial
Union has chosen the right time to expand overseas. After three years of
rising premiums, the UK is turning in exceptional underwriting profits. But
the handsome returns on equity now being enjoyed by the composite insurers
are unsustainable. While the 2 per cent fall in GA's shares yesterday partly
reflected disappointment over the group's investment performance,
shareholders may also wonder where the impetus for growth will come from.
With underwriting losses outside the UK amounting to Pounds 51m in the
second quarter, there is clearly further room for self-help. An improvement
in the results of GA's London market operations, lower reinsurance costs and
better luck with the weather would all help. Yet modest gains could easily
be eroded as the UK cycle starts to slip back. Without an upturn in the US
underwriting cycle it is difficult to see the North American businesses -
which account for 44 per cent of premium income - delivering spectacularly
better results. Having paid down the debt taken on for the disastrous
purchase of NZI Corporation in 1988, GA might take a deep breath and start
looking for acquisitions again.
