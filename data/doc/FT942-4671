FT  08 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt frightened by new
loan losses rumour
As equities wobbled around the world, Mr David Roche and his new firm,
Independent Strategy, offered encouragement yesterday to long term financial
asset markets, writes Our Markets Staff.
'The conditions are set for mild world economic recovery, no return of
inflation and lower bond yields in most countries,' said Mr Roche, marking
out German, US and Japanese equities and bonds for positive surprises. But
yesterday's German surprise was quite the reverse.
FRANKFURT was running along contentedly when the bottom fell out of the
market. The Dax index closed the session 27.97 lower at 2,135.10 and hit
2,123.67 in the post-bourse before ending at 2,131.80, down 1.5 per cent on
the day.
Share prices foundered on a rumour that major banks were at risk of more
heavy losses from a corporate borrower - perhaps, once again, in the real
estate sector. The banks denied it but Bayernhypo fell DM13, or 2.9 per
cent, to DM429.50 and Commerzbank DM12.50, or 3.7 per cent, to DM325.
Elsewhere, Daimler led the slide with a fall of DM12.50 to DM802; Siemens
lost DM13 at DM695.50; and, in a weak engineering sector, KHD and
Klockner-Werke fell DM4.60 to DM135.90 and DM5.50 to DM153.50 respectively.
Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt said that the banking rumour
had a general effect on share prices. Noting that turnover stayed low
yesterday, rising from DM5.2bn to DM5.3bn, she added: 'With volume this low,
people can make money out of other people's fears.'
MILAN recovered 1.6 per cent as domestic and foreign investors returned to
buy blue chips. The Comit index regained 11.73 at 750.66as the market
awaited government measures, possibly today, to help the labour market.
Investors were further cheered by news that Italian equity funds continued
to record net receipts in May, confounding worries that the recent market
downturn might have indicated net redemptions during the month.
Fiat led the advance, adding L239, or 3.5 per cent, at L7,060 after comments
by Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, Fiat Auto president, that the group was struggling to
keep up with demand for the new Punto model. Olivetti put on L100 at L2,651
and Pirelli added L102 at L2,769.
Sip and Stet, foreign favourites, both rose by 4.1 per cent, by L181 to
L4,555 and by L221 to L5,582 respectively.
Against the trend, Credito Italiano fell L23 to L2,361 on news that it
planned to raise L2,000bn over five years through rights issues.
PARIS bounced back from the session's lows, helped by a technical recovery
late in the day in futures. The CAC-40 index finished 13.41 down at
2,023.74, in turnover of some FFr3bn.
Suez rose FFr2.60 to FFr308.50 as the market was swept by rumours that the
sale of its Groupe Victoire insurance subsidiary was imminent.
Rhone-Poulenc, FFr1.70 cheaper at FFr133.50, was also subject to unconfirmed
reports that it was to buy out the minority shareholding in Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer, a US subsidiary, in which it has a 68 per cent shareholding.
AMSTERDAM drifted lower in a session dominated by broad declines in blue
chip issues. The AEX index shed 2.07 to 405.28 as Royal Dutch dipped Fl 2.60
to Fl 196.80 on weakness in oil prices.
Nedlloyd drifted down Fl 1.40 at Fl 66.60 with James Capel reiterating its
sell recommendation. On the upside, KLM rose 40 cents to Fl 49.40 as the
airline reported a rise in passenger traffic during May.
ZURICH made an early attempt to add to Monday's rally, before renewed
profit-taking and a weak bond market pulled prices back. The SMI index ended
3.3 off at 2,778.1 after a morning peak of 2,798.
Roche certificates found Monday's strength short-lived, giving up SFr40 to
SFr6,840. Cyclicals were mixed: BBC lost SFr8 to SFr1,225 while Sulzer
registered put on SFr14 to SFr948 after a recommendation from Credit Suisse.
SMH lost SFr11 to SFr810 after the watchmaker said it expected only modest
profit growth this year but was confident about the outlook for its core
business.
MADRID was hit by last minute selling after a drop in the futures market,
and the general index fell 3.52 to 323.54 in turnover estimated at less than
Pta25bn.
ATHENS slipped nearly 2 per cent on profit-taking, with most of the losses
seen among construction stocks. The general index lost 17.3 to 854.54, in a
session extended by one hour following technical problems.
HELSINKI fell 1.2 per cent but two of its conglomerates fared worse.
Huhtamaki lost FM20, or 9.5 per cent at FM190 after its profits came out
higher, but far below analysts' expectations; and Amer shed FM3, or 2.2 per
cent to FM131 although it reported a 67 per cent rise in earnings per share
for the first four months of 1994. The Hex index closed 21.4 lower at
1,754.6.
WARSAW dropped back for the third consecutive session as the Wig index fell
376.5 or 3.6 per cent to 10,221.7.
Turnover declined by 5 per cent to 995bn zlotys as volume rose 49 per cent
to 2.7m shares
ISTANBUL fell 1.6 per cent in a volatile session, which concentrated mainly
state industries after the head of the privatisation agency urged that the
privatisation programme should be accelerated.
The composite index lost 217.34 to 16,536.4, having begun the day at
17,225.65. Turnover dropped to TL1,183bn.
