  [Text] As BELAPAN has previously reported, on 11 January 
[as received] a delegation of the Ukrainian Association of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, headed by former Ukrainian 
Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, arrived in Minsk. The Ukrainian 
delegation participated in an expanded session of the Belarusian 
Confederation of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, met with 
representatives of industrial enterprises, entrepreneurs, and 
Belarusian Supreme Soviet deputies. In the afternoon, Leonid 
Kuchma met with Vyacheslav Kebich. On the same day, the former 
Ukrainian prime minister held a news conference. "Economic 
conditions compel us and our Belarusian colleagues," he said, 
"to make our legislatures and governments pay special attention 
to the problems we are currently experiencing.... We have 
crossed that dangerous line which separates us from the 
abyss...." In the opinion of Leonid Kuchma, 
Belarusian-Ukrainian relations are very weak.
