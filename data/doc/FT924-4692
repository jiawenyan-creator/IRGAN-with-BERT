FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: TI sells Dowty stake in command systems
business
TI GROUP, the specialist engineering company which took over the Dowty
aerospace and defence concern in June, yesterday sold Dowty's 50 per cent
share in a naval command system business for an undisclosed sum.
Under the deal, Dowty-Sema, which is developing command systems for the UK's
latest frigates and nuclear submarines, is being absorbed by BAeSema, a
joint venture between British Aerospace and Sema, the Anglo-French software
and systems company.
Mr Alex Dorrian, BAeSema managing director, said the move had been under
discussion since before TI made its hostile bid for Dowty. Dowty would
continue to work as a sub-contractor, particularly in the supply of
hardware.
The change was aimed at creating a better vehicle for overseas sales and
closer co-ordination with BAe's ambitions as a naval supplier.
Neither TI nor BAeSema was willing to provide details of the terms of the
deal.
