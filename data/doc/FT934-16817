FT  05 OCT 93 / Sihanouk offers role for rebels
CAMBODIAN King Norodom Sihanouk said yesterday the hardline Khmer Rouge
guerrilla group would be brought into Cambodia's new government as advisers,
AP reports from Phnom Penh.
This followed talks last Friday with Mr Khieu Samphan, Khmer Rouge
president. The Khmer Rouge issued a statement after the talks saying it
wanted peace but indicating it would never reach a settlement with the
coalition government, elected in a United Nations-organised poll in May.
Earlier, the group had asked for an advisory post in the new administration,
saying it then would turn over the 20 per cent of Cambodia it controls and
its 10,000 hard-core guerrillas.
