FT  02 SEP 94 / Northern Ireland: Bomb targets warned not to drop their
guard - Insurance
Insurers, hit by heavy claims from the IRA's mainland bombing campaign,
yesterday welcomed this week's ceasefire but insisted that new arrangements
for terrorism insurance and security precautions should remain in place.
Insurers have been hardest hit by the two IRA bombs in the City. Claims from
the Baltic exchange bomb in April 1992 amounted to Pounds 300m, including
about Pounds 100m for interruption to business. Claims from the Bishopsgate
bomb, a year later, totalled Pounds 500m, with about Pounds 150m for
business interruption.
Losses from other smaller bombs amount to less than Pounds 10m, said Mr Tony
Baker, deputy director-general of the Association of British Insurers.
In Northern Ireland the government has paid more than Pounds 620m since the
late 1960s to compensate property owners for damage. Losses rose to Pounds
50m in 1976-77 before falling steadily to Pounds 15m in 1986-87, but the
bill in 1991-92 was Pounds 33m.
After the London bombs, insurers withdrew cover for terrorism from standard
commercial policies. It is offered as a separate policy, with insurance
companies covering their own exposures through Pool Re, a company owned by
the insurance industry and backed by the government.
The decision by Pool Re to charge more to businesses in central London and
other areas judged to be terrorist targets than those in less vulnerable
areas caused considerable controversy.
Mr Baker said these problems had been overcome by insurers reducing some
expensive premiums in return for the installation or adoption of security
precautions. Mr Baker said changes were not likely for at least a year.
Mr Baker argued for the maintenance of security, such as the restrictions of
traffic in the City, and said there had to be a degree of caution.
