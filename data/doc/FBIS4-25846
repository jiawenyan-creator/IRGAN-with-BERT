  [Text] Hangzhou, June 12 (XINHUA) -- A businessman from 
Taiwan said here today that the trial for murder in the March 31 
Qiandao Lake tragedy has helped the public know the truth of the 
case. 
  Steven Lin, general manager of Soaring Travel Service Ltd. 
of 
Taiwan, said this after listening to the verdict in the 
courtroom this morning. He also listened to court arguments and 
final pleadings of the accused yesterday. 
  Wu Lihong, Hu Zhihan and Yu Aijun were found guilty of 
robbing and murdering 24 Taiwanese tourists and eight mainland 
crew in the boat-fire tragedy on Qiandao Lake in eastern 
Zhejiang Province and sentenced to death by the Hangzhou 
intermediate court earlier today. 
  The 24 Taiwan victims were all part of a tourist group 
organized by Lin's travel service. 
  Lin said that in the process of the trial, "everything was 
dealt with according to law." 
  He has told relevant departments on the mainland that he 
wants to take the recording and video tapes of the trial back to 
Taiwan so that the relatives of the victims can know the details 
of the trial. 
  According to Lin, a very high percentage of tourist services 
in Taiwan focus on business with the Chinese mainland. 
Therefore, he said, the boycott on tourists to the mainland by 
Taiwan authorities since the multiple murder in May has caused 
"great losses" to Taiwanese tourism businesses. 
  "A boycott cannot solve the issue of the Qiandao Lake case," 
he said. He called on the Taiwan authorities to lift the 
boycott during the present peak season so as to revive the 
tourism links with the mainland.
