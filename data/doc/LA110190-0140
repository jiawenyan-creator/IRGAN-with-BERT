WEST COVINA MOVES TO REQUIRE CITY PERMIT TO CUT DOWN TREES 
Last May, a developer mowed down 30 oak trees along Oak Canyon Road. The City 
Council wants to make sure that it doesn't happen again. 
The council gave preliminary approval Monday to an ordinance requiring permits 
for removing or pruning most trees. The final vote will be Nov. 12. 
The new law would require a resident to get a permit from the city to remove a 
tree whose trunk is at least one foot in diameter in a front yard or side yard 
facing the street. In addition, the tree would have to be relocated or 
replaced. 
Even stricter rules would apply to oak and sycamore trees: Permits would be 
required to remove or prune trees whose trunks are at least six inches in 
diameter. 
The new law would stop developers from cutting down historic trees, said Tina 
Daniels, former president of the West Covina Historical Society. 
If adopted, it would replace a citywide moratorium that has prohibited removal 
of oak, walnut, sycamore and pepper trees since the May incident. 
Pat Haley, West Covina's planning director, said the ordinance provides that 
violators can be fined up to $1,000 or sentenced to six months' imprisonment, 
or both. FRANKI V. RANSOM
