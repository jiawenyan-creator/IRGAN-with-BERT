FT  11 DEC 92 / Letter: Ballet was enthralling, and not misguided
Sir, I read with incredulity the review by Clement Crisp on The Tales of
Beatrix Potter (Arts, December 7).
I have recently watched Swan Lake in awe and been moved to tears at
Mayerling (which I saw twice). I found the production of The Dream and
Beatrix Potter simply marvellous.
Rather than viewing the 'staging as misguided and unworthy', I sat
enthralled, watching these 'animals' dance. Moreover, at the Saturday
evening performance, I noticed only a handful of children; so how Mr Crisp
concluded that 'It is . . . a ploy by Covent Garden to bring in an audience
on the tugging arms of children' I will never know.
The house was packed to bursting point (I had to queue at 9.30am on Saturday
to obtain a ticket) and the final applause tumultuous.
Perhaps Mr Crisp should have talked, as I did, to 'your average punter'; he
would have found that most people had a fantastic evening's entertainment
and hence 'the attentions of Rentokil' may be better applied to his column.
