FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: United Gulf Bank profit tumbles
27% to Dollars 13.7m
BAHRAIN-based United Gulf Bank revealed yesterday that net profit fell 27
per cent in 1992 to Dollars 13.7m from Dollars 18.8m a year earlier, AP-DJ
reports.
The offshore banking unit said its gross income rose 35 per cent in 1992 to
Dollars 25.1m from Dollars 18.6m, helped by a large increase in income from
investment in managed portfolios.
However, it said the increased costs of funding and hedging its assets,
owing to the high interest rate climate during 1992, resulted in a loss on
interest expenses of Dollars 6.85m, compared with a loss of Dollars 953,000
a year earlier.
Additionally, the bank's foreign exchange operations showed a loss of
Dollars 2.74m, compared with a gain of Dollars 2.45m in the previous year.
United Gulf said these factors pared the gross income, leaving the bank
showing a sharp fall in net income, compared with a year earlier.
Total assets of the bank increased 32 per cent, however. At the end of 1992,
assets were Dollars 297.1m, against with Dollars 225m at the end of 1991.
The bank's statement also showed that the bank's accumulated deficit fell to
Dollars 28m from Dollars 40.4m a year earlier.
