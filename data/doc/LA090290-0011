*** 1/2 JANE'S ADDICTION "RITUAL DE LO HABITUAL" WARNER BROS.: ALBUMS ARE RATED 
ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC). 
As film buffs await the newest from Kubrick and lit buffs the latest from 
Mailer, certain underground-rock fans look forward to a new release from Jane's 
Addiction -- one of the very few groups capable of recording the Great American 
Album. And just as surely are they disappointed when it falls short. 
After all, it's the very unapproachability of the Big One that makes it such a 
tantalizing ideal. And Jane's, who toy artily with the boundaries of rock but 
also play riffs Jimmy Page would have given his whammy bar to have written, 
somehow record very good albums while they try. They mean it, man. 
So where Stephen Perkins may be the most powerful, rhythmically inventive 
drummer in rock 'n' roll, he was completely buried in the mix on Jane's' debut, 
"Nothing's Shocking." The lyrics tended toward the druggy 
stream-of-consciousness and the song structures tended toward anarchy. It was 
still one of the best albums of the '80s. 
"Ritual" is if anything more incoherent, scenes from the inner life of a 
mixed-up kid -- singer Perry Farrell. It rambles, it's murky, it features a 
long, vaguely Oriental violin solo. But "Ritual" is also oddly compelling, sort 
of an art-rock tour de force, and some of the sing-song melodies and images in 
the lyrics -- Farrell's brother making him slap himself in the face, a girl 
shoplifting a razor by sticking it under her skirt -- stick with you for far 
longer than you think they should. Plus, "Three Days" has the longest crescendo 
in rock history. JONATHAN GOLD
