FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: First half deficit at John D Wood
John D Wood, the USM-quoted estate agent, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
194,000 in the six months to October 31 1991.
That followed the deficit of Pounds 186,000 in the second half of last year,
and compared with a profit of Pounds 201,000 in the corresponding first
half.
Losses per share were 1.9p (earnings 1.5p) and the interim dividend is
omitted. Last year 1.5p was paid but there was no final.
Mr George Pope and Mr Ian Homersham, joint chairmen, said the nine central
London sales offices and lettings and management department continued to
trade profitably.
They pointed out that the recession caused greater problems within the
country department, where values had fallen dramatically from the peak of
1988. Increasingly difficult trading conditions in agriculture led to a
reduction in the size of the agricultural department.
Turnover fell nearly 6 per cent to Pounds 2.56m and expenditure increased
slightly because of the new office in Wimbledon, expansion of the
development department, unlet space within the head office, and redundancy
costs. Recurring controllable expenditure, however, was reduced.
