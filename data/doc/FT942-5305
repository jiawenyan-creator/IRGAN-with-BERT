FT  06 JUN 94 / Haiti refugees for UK islands
Britain has agreed to let Washington use the Turks and Caicos Islands, a
British archipelago in the Caribbean, for processing Haitians seeking asylum
in the US, writes David Owen in London.
This was agreed over the weekend at a meeting of Mr John Major, UK prime
minister, and US President Bill Clinton. The proposed processing centre
could be in use by next month.
The agreement on Haitian asylum-seekers came less than a week after Mr P J
Patterson, Jamaican prime minister, had said his country was to let its
territorial waters be used for the questioning, on board US-chartered ships,
of Haitian refugees who had been intercepted at sea by US forces.
The prime minister and the president used their informal meeting, in Britain
during the D-Day commemoration, to discuss a wide range of issues, including
North Korea, Bosnia, Rwanda and Northern Ireland. On Bosnia, the two men
welcomed the establishment of a diplomatic process to bring together the US,
the European Union and Russia, and the two men discussed plans for a
conference in Geneva on the reconstruction of Sarajevo.
