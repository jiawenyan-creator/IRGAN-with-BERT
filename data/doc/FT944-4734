FT  07 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fat salaries for the big league
players carry personal risks
Sir, Regarding the 75 per cent pay increase to British Gas's chief
executive, the reason why the increase is so high is that public-sector top
management pay is so low in comparison with similar jobs elsewhere.
Even spreading the increase over three years would have provoked a public
outcry. Attention is drawn because Cedric Brown is a long-serving employee.
Had someone been recruited from outside, no one would have raised an
eyebrow. It is therefore a one-off.
If, however, Mr Brown does not perform at the level his new salary demands
then inbuilt penalties should be invoked. High salaries for big league
players carry high personal risk.
