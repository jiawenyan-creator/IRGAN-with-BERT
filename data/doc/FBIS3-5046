  [Text] Pyongyang, March 2 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 
a statement today vehemently denounced the massacre of 
Palestinians by Israeli extremists in Hebron on the West Bank as 
a grave crime. The spokesman said: 
  This massacre is violent terrorism against Palestinians, 
which is a deliberate provocation to create an artificial 
obstacle to the on-going Middle East peace process. The tragic 
incident at a mosque on the West Bank is an immediate conseqence 
of the occupation policy of Israel. It shows that the danger to 
the lives of the Palestinian people cannot be removed nor can 
they be freed from their miserable lot, unless the Middle East 
issues including the Palestinian problem are resolved. 
  For guaranteeing a durable peace in the Middle East Israel 
must withdraw from the occupied Arab lands and the Mideast 
problem be solved fairly and comprehensively in the interests of 
the people in the region. 
  The Israeli authorities must punish those who murdered and 
wounded innocent Palestinians, take a step to assist the victims 
and, at the same time ensure that no actions contrary to the 
peace process in the region are committed. 
  We will continue to extend active support and firm 
solidarity 
to the just struggle of the Palestinian people and the entire 
Arab people to restore the legitimate national rights and 
accelerate the peace process in the Middle East.
