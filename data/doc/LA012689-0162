Fontana stonemason Vincent Ronald Monacco said he plans to buy some Italian 
suits, travel to the French Riviera and buy a new BMW -- but he isn't sure 
whether he will continue laying bricks. Monacco, 39, won $5.8 million Saturday, 
sharing the $40.7-million Lotto jackpot pool with six others. Each will collect 
$232,000 a year, after taxes, for 20 years. Monacco said he will continue to 
live in Fontana, where he was born. "Fontana is my home," he said.
