METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TATTOO BAN MAY BE ALTERED TO ALLOW MAKEUP 
A ban on tattooing in Torrance may be modified to allow the application of 
permanent makeup, in which pigment is added to the skin around eyes, mouths and 
eyebrows. 
This week, City Council members said they would like to change their 
30-year-old ordinance outlawing tattooing to allow both permanent makeup and 
cosmetic reconstruction, in which pigment is used to hide scars or return 
damaged skin to more natural tones. The council told staff members to prepare 
possible amendments to the city's anti-tattooing law for consideration Dec. 19. 
Three cosmetologists were ordered to stop their tattooing services several 
weeks ago when a woman seeking a business license to offer permanent makeup 
protested the license's denial by showing city officials advertisements from 
the three businesses. One cosmetologist appealed the order to the council.
