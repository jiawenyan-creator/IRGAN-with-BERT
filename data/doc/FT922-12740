FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Marriott blames static earnings
on over supply
MARRIOTT Corporation, the large but indebted hotels group, yesterday
reported static first-quarter profits of Dollars 11m after-tax (Dollars 10m
a year ago), and blamed the lack of progress on the continued over supply of
space in the domestic market.
Sales during the first quarter totalled Dollars 1.95bn (Dollars 1.83bn), and
Marriott claimed that  - once asset sales and some other non-comparable
factors were stripped out  - underlying operating profits improved by 11 per
cent.
It said occupancy rates for comparable units generally rose  - with the
full-service division showing a three percentage point increase, to the
mid-70s. However, average room rates were lower than a year ago in all four
lodging segments.
The company also announced that it had completed Dollars 200m-worth of asset
sales since the end of 1991  - part of programme to bring down debt  - and
has signed agreements for another Dollars 200m scheduled for completion by
the summer.
Polaroid, the photographic products company, reported a slip in
first-quarter sales, coupled with a sharper fall in earnings. After-tax
profits stood at Dollars 6.2m, compared with Dollars 16.4m in the same
period of 1991, while sales fell by 2 per cent to Dollars 431.3m.
Sales in the US were marginally higher, at Dollars 205.9m, but international
revenues fell to Dollars 225.4m. Polaroid, which had already warned of the
sales slippage, said that it was hit on the international side by the
stronger dollar, and weak economic climates in Europe and Japan.
Operating profits fell from Dollars 49.9m to Dollars 26.8m.
