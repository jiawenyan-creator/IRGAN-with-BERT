Clauses on Nuclear Non-Proliferation To Be Included in 
Cooperation Agreements"; as released by Brussels Textline

  [Text] Brussels, 17 Mar 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- With the 
adoption of the report by Carlos Robles Piquer on the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty which must be extended in 1995, the EP 
Committee on Energy, Research and Technology has called on the 
European Union to define "as uniform a position as possible" on 
this issue in order to reinforce the guarantees against the risk 
of proliferation. According to MEP's, the European Union should 
tend, moreover, towards establishing an international and 
universal control system of the "complete cycle" of uranium, 
plutonium and possibly thorium, for civilian purposes. In 
addition, MEP's consider that, in the cooperation agreements 
with third countries, the Union should include clauses on the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Finally, MEP's took an 
explicit stand in favour of establishing a denuclearised zone in 
the Near East.
