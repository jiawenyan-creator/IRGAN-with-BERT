FT  03 APR 93 / Reserves show fall of Dollars 1.74bn
BRITAIN'S gold and foreign currency reserves fell an underlying Dollars
1.741bn in March. The fall largely reflected repayment by the government of
the last of the official short-term borrowings made in September's battle to
keep sterling in the European exchange rate mechanism.
The repayment came as a surprise to the City, where the consensus among
economists had been that the reserves would show virtually no change last
month. However, it had no impact on UK financial markets.
The government borrowed heavily from the European Community's very
short-term financing facility to obtain foreign currency to support sterling
before it was forced to leave the ERM on September 16.
The funds repaid last month were borrowed initially for three months, then
rolled forward for a further three months as allowed under ERM rules.
The overall level of the UK's reserves fell by Dollars 1.869bn last month,
bringing the reserves at the end of March to Dollars 41.583bn, compared with
Dollars 43.452bn at the end of February. The reserves were then revalued to
reflect changes in the value of their gold and foreign currency components
in the financial year to March 31 to stand at Dollars 40.898bn, compared
with Dollars 45.027bn at the end of March last year.
The Treasury said the underlying drop in the reserves included the transfer
of 210,720 ounces of gold worth Dollars 54m to Latvia.
Included in the overall drop in the reserves was a Dollars 42m fall in the
dollar value of the Ecu10bn revolving credit facility arranged by the
government early in Sept-ember to help bolster sterling.
