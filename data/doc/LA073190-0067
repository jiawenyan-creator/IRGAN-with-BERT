Deion Sanders has become a defensive back again, having left the New York 
Yankees for the rest of the baseball season to begin preparing to play football 
for the Atlanta Falcons. 
"I'm leaving. I'm going to football," said Sanders as he cleaned out his 
locker. "Maybe I'll be back next year with the Yankees." 
Sanders, the Yankees and the Falcons had been involved in a wrangle over 
contracts and service responsibilities. 
He had been seeking a $1-million contract for the 1991 baseball season, but the 
Yankees rejected that on Monday and broke off talks. 
Sanders was hitting .158 for the Yankees, the lowest average of any major 
leaguer with at least 125 at-bats.
