FT  11 FEB 93 / Taiwan breaks with the political past: Native-born PM ends
reign of Chiang Kai-shek's old comrades
PRESIDENT Lee Teng-hui has taken a big step towards purging Taiwan of its
political domination by the ageing supporters of Chiang Kai-shek, its
founder, by appointing the first native Taiwanese, Mr Lien Chan, to be prime
minister.
Taiwan has been shaken by political instability in recent months, as former
Nationalist soldiers have fought to retain a vestige of control within the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party against President Lee's reformist Mainstream
faction. The old guard has finally lost.
The stock market surged initially on the long-expected news, seen as
providing a seal of approval for President Lee's pro-business policies. But
a late sell-off by profit-takers led yesterday's Taipei index to close 59
points lower at 3,578.
Mr Lien, 56, former governor of Taiwan Province, is from one of Taiwan's
wealthiest families.
Deemed an uncharismatic man, he is expected to act as an executive
lieutenant to Mr Lee, without providing any political challenge. With Mr
Lien's appointment, President Lee is finally in a position to push forward a
democratic reform programme with a minimum of opposition from within his own
party.
His success has surprised many analysts, following his poor performance in
December's parliamentary elections when the KMT received its lowest-ever
vote of 53 per cent.
