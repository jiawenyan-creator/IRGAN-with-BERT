JACKSON ON DEMOCRACY 
Amen to Jesse Jackson's analysis of American non-voting, the institutional 
barriers to U.S. voter registration, and his plea for universal voter 
registration ("Our Languishing Democracy: To Reverse the Decline, Universal 
Voter Registration Is A Must," Op-Ed Page, July 5). What the Rev. Jackson does 
not address is the growing majority of American non-voters who look on voting 
as a futile gesture irrelevant to their personal needs. 
As an adult school counselor, I offer this suggestion in response to the 
appalling statistic provided by the U.S. Census Bureau that the largest 
demographic group of non-voters by far is that of persons between the ages of 
18 and 24, the immediate products of our high schools. 
In adult school and the senior year of high school we should offer a course 
entitled "Why vote?" The course should address immediate student problems and 
aspirations as they relate to legislation and the vote, e.g. finding suitable 
employment, continuing education toward a suitable goal, starting a family, 
military service, health needs and dangers, etc. At the end of the course 
provide registration by mail to students 18 or older, or a registration form to 
be mailed on the student's 18th birthday.
