offered the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) the use of military 
exercise facilities on the territory of Slovakia. Ondrej Hanko, 
director of the Slovak Government Press Department, disclosed 
this after a meeting between Prime Minister Meciar and Gebhardt

favorably by von Moltke, Hanko said, and added that the 
high-ranking official of the Alliance appreciated the "rapid and 
unequivocal" union with the project on the part of Slovakia. 
The prime minister also proposed that a NATO school be 
established in Slovakia that would serve not only the Visegrad 
Four countries but also other countries interested in joining 
the Alliance.
