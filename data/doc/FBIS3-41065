  [Text] Cairo, 3 Feb (MENA)--An Arab diplomatic source has 
said that the Working Group on Arms Control and Regional 
Security, emanating from the multilateral talks on peace in the 
Middle East and now meeting in Cairo, has not yet reached an 
agreement on arms control because the Israelis are expressing 
reservations at conducting a detailed discussion of the subject. 
  The source told MENA today that the Israelis are mainly 
concentrating on the first part--arrangements for regional 
security with a view toward breaking the Arab wall around Israel. 
  The source said the Israeli delegation wants to finish 
promptly with security arrangements, as this would mean an 
implicit recognition of Israel by the region's states, while it 
refrains from entering into a detailed discussion of arms 
control. 
  It should be noted that the prevailing view among the 
delegates is that the two subjects must be discussed together 
without focusing on one to the exclusion of the other.
