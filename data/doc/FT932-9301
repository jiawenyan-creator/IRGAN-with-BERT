FT  14 MAY 93 / People: Invesco goes for safety
Invesco MIM is expected shortly to appoint Bill Stuttaford, currently
chairman of Brown Shipley Investment Management, as non-executive chairman
of its European regional business.
Invesco, which expects the nearly two year long investigation by regulators
Imro to be concluded within the next thirty days, is engaged in a drive to
break away from its over-exciting past, restore its battered reputation and
replace a number of high-profile departures.
Stuttaford, 64, is a well known City figure in broking and fund management
circles. Chairman of the Unit Trust Association between 1987-1989, his
heyday was building up fund manager Framlington; the latter was taken over
by Throgmorton in an acrimonious bid battle, and Stuttaford left a year
later for Brown Shipley. Brown Shipley Holdings in turn has just been
purchased by Sir Ron Brierley's Guinness Peat.
Stuttaford, while generally well-liked, has little track record in
turnaround situations - and it is medical not company doctoring that his
brother Thomas, medical columnist on The Times, knows about.
While Charles Brady is executive chairman of the main board, the group is
devolving regional control to three subsidiary boards splitting up the US,
Europe and the Far East. Norman Riddell is the recently arrived chief
executive of the European operation.
Many of the links with Invesco MIM's past and the days of ex-chairman Lord
Stevens and Britannia Arrow are being severed.
Kevin Ney and Lord Rippon, who have both been on the board since 1977, are
stepping down at the June agm as is Sir David Nicolson.
