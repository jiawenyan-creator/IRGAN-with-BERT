FT  19 APR 93 / Letter: Keep talent from emigrating
Sir, Edward Mortimer argues persuasively ('Convenient cracks in the wall',
April 15) for an EC 'managed immigration' policy. But by syphoning off those
with 'the needed skills and allowing them to come in legally', western
Europe would be depriving eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union (FSU)
of precisely the individuals - hard-working, youthful and skilled - that are
essential to economic regeneration in these regions. More than 8,000 Russian
scientists have emigrated to New York alone in the last two years. Multiply
that across the entire FSU's territory and sphere of influence, and it is
clear that managed immigration will degrade even further the ability of the
ex-communist world ever to catch up with the west, which will simply feed
the emigration cycle later on. A more powerful case can be made for
targeting western aid to jobs that 'anchor' talented people from the FSU
where they can best do good - in their home countries.
