FT  16 JUL 92 / Observer: Going for a song
The ghost of Yoshi Fujiwara must be smiling contentedly through Japan's
economic gloom. While the Japanese may have ceased knocking back champagne,
they are still coughing up handsomely for western opera, which the tenor
Fujiwara first popularised there 59 years ago.
Around 2,500 of them have paid Pounds 2,350 apiece for tickets for tours by
visiting opera companies over the next four years. Britain's Royal Opera,
first on stage this month with Mozart, will be followed next year by
counterpart companies from Berlin, Vienna and Milan.
The Y560,000 tickets, which cover 14 operas, have sold so well that the
organisers have rationed sales to leave seats for people not rich enough to
attend all the performances.
The British company has already touched not just the heart- but the
purse-strings of Hirotaro Higuchi, president of the tours' sponsor Asahi
Breweries. Even though Asahi has not escaped unhurt from the troubles, at
the Royal Opera's Tokyo party he upped and pledged a contribution to the
Pounds 250m renovation scheme for Covent Garden.
His hosts were so shocked that silence reigned until his words were
digested, when it gave way to spontaneous applause. Asahi officials also
appear to have been surprised - it took them two days to confirm the details
of their president's promise.
