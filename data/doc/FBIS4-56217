  [Text] Havana, 29 Apr (EFE) -- Six Cubans who attempted to 
leave the island illegally in a boat were arrested today at El 
Malecon, the Havana avenue bordering the northern coast, in an 
area near the U.S. Interests Section, eyewitnesses have reported. 
  They are four men and two women who were spotted by a coast 
guard patrol several miles away. The coast guard patrol steered 
the rafters' flimsy boat to El Malecon, where they were met by 
police. A police car took the group of "rafters" away from the 
area, while approximately 50 bystanders and passersby witnessed 
the scene, according to the sources. The frustrated "rafters" 
attempted to reach the coast of Florida aboard a simple raft 
constructed from three tractor chambers, tied to pieces of wood 
with rope. 
  So far this year, 1,824 Cubans have reached the coast of 
Florida and of this number, 718 were picked up by the U.S. Coast 
Guard this month, according to the U.S. agency.
