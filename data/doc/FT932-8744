FT  18 MAY 93 / Taiwan bids to rejoin UN
Taiwan, backed by its economic strength, will make a big effort to rejoin
the United Nations, according to Mr Fredrick Chien, foreign minister, AP
reports from Taipei.
On Saturday, President Lee Teng-hui said it was 'immoral and unfair' to
exclude Taiwan from the UN. Beijing would be certain to oppose any serious
consideration of Taiwan's proposal.
