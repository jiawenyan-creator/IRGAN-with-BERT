FT  08 JUN 93 / Observer: Loosening up
When it comes to winning public accolades there is not a lot to choose
between South Africa's two chief constitutional adversaries - Roelf Meyer
from the government and Cyril Ramaphosa from the African National Congress.
Last week they received two honours jointly, flew to America together, and
in the words of a local columnist 'grew so close that they could wear each
other's smiles'.
When it comes to humour ANC secretary general Ramaphosa has had an edge over
the Afrikaner constitutional minister up to now. However, Meyer is learning
fast from his opposite number. When the two men jointly accepted their 'man
of the year award' from the ANC newspaper, the New Nation, last week, Meyer
recalled that when he attended a lunch after the president's momentous 1990
speech unbanning the ANC, the wine on the luncheon table was from the estate
'Allesverloren' (All is lost). At the New Nation banquet the wine was
'Buitenverwachting' (Waiting outside) - fair comment on the political
situation.
