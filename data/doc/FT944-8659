FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Campbell Soup lifted by strong
US markets
A sharp rebound in its domestic businesses helped Campbell Soup, the US food
group, post a 19 per cent jump in first-quarter earnings to a record Dollars
197m, or 79 cents a share. Net sales in the period totalled Dollars 1.86bn,
up from Dollars 1.76bn a year earlier.
An upbeat Mr David Johnson, chairman, said yesterday: 'Our US businesses
have come roaring back, and our international businesses have continued on a
fast pace.'
In the US, Campbell's sales rose to Dollars 1.12bn from Dollars 1.07bn as
strong volume gains from a number of products - including frozen dinners,
spaghetti sauce and pickles - helped offset a drop in soup shipments which
the group said was part of its programme to eliminate costly peaks in its
manufacturing and shipping cycles.
Bakery and confectionery sales rose 6 per cent to Dollars 417m in the wake
of volume gains in chocolate and biscuit products at home and overseas,
while international grocery sales jumped 11 per cent to Dollars 341m, aided
by strong sales of soups worldwide.
The record results helped Campbell's share price climb Dollars 1 1/4 to
close at Dollars 45 1/2 , a high for the year.
