  [Text] Britain has expelled a Russian diplomat in a 
tit-for-tat measure after a man accused of being an MI6 spy was 
asked to leave Moscow. The British diplomat, named by the 
Russians as John Scarlett, was reported to be head of MI6 in 
Moscow and was expelled last month. 
  The Foreign Office today confirmed expulsion of the Russian 
as a reciprocal move. The expulsions follow a television 
appearance in Russia by a man who claimed the British recruited 
him as a spy. 
  "We were asked by the Russians to withdraw a diplomat," an 
FO 
[Foreign Office] spokesman said. "We regret this demand, which 
is at odds with the bilateral relationship we are trying to 
build. In response, we asked the Russians to withdraw the 
diplomat from London. Neither diplomat has been declared 
persona non grata. We hope this is an end to the affair." 
  It follows recent damaging revelations that top CIA agent 
Aldrich Ames had been working for the Russians.
