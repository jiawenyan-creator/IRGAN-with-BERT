FT  26 APR 94 / UK Company News: Waterglade details sent to markets in
'mix-up'
Waterglade International Holdings, the loss-making property developer,
yesterday said details of its refinancing and debt rescheduling plan had
been sent inadvertently to market makers.
Describing the mix-up as an 'administrative error', Mr Tom Megas, managing
director, said documents had been sent to unidentified market makers by
stockbrokers involved in the reorganisation.
The refinancing packaging, which has already been agreed with the group's
main creditors, has yet to approved by shareholders.
It is dominated by a placing and open offer, although Mr Megas declined to
reveal the sums involved.
The refinancing follows Waterglade's announcement last November of an Pounds
11.7m pre-tax loss for the 14 months to May 31.
