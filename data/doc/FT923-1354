FT  23 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kanowna Belle mine to proceed
NORTH Broken Hill and Delta Gold, the Australian mining companies, are to
proceed with the development of the Kanowna Belle gold mine in Western
Australia at a cost of ADollars 78m (Dollars 57m).
The companies said yesterday the joint venture expected to begin production
at the beginning of 1993, with initial output of 150,000 oz of gold, rising
to 170,000 oz in the second year.
This would make the mine one of the largest in Australia and enhances the
Kanowna Belle area's reputation as the most significant new gold province in
the country.
