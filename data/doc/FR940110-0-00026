Authority: 

31 U.S.C. 3720A.



10557.001

Purpose.




This part establishes procedures for the General Services Administration (GSA) to refer past due debts to the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) for offset against income tax refunds of taxpayers owing debts to GSA.



10557.002

Applicability and scope.




(a) This part implements 31 U.S.C. 3720A which authorizes the IRS to reduce a tax refund by the amount of a past due legally
enforceable debt owed to the United States.


(b) For purposes of this section, a past due legally enforceable debt referable to the IRS is a debt which is owed to the
United States and:


(1) Has been delinquent for at least three months but, except in the case of a judgment debt, has not been delinquent
more than ten years at the time the offset is made;


(2) With respect to which, GSA has given the taxpayer at least 60 days, from the date of notification, to present evidence
that all or part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable, has considered such evidence, and has determined
that the debt is past due and legally enforceable;


(3) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);


(4) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the administrative offset provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716;


(5) Has been disclosed by GSA to a credit reporting agency, including a consumer reporting agency as authorized by
31 U.S.C. 3711(f);


(6) With respect to which, GSA has notified, or has made a reasonable attempt to notify, the taxpayer that the debt is
past due and, unless repaid within 60 days thereafter, will be referred to the IRS for offset against any income tax
refunds due the taxpayer;


(7) Is at least $25.00;


(8) All other requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and the Department of the Treasury regulations relating to eligibility
of a debt for tax refund offset, at 26 CFR 301.64026T, have been satisfied.



10557.003

Administrative charges.




All administrative charges incurred in connection with the referral of debts to the IRS will be added to the debt, thus
increasing the amount of the offset.



10557.004

Reasonable attempt to notify.




In order to constitute a reasonable attempt to notify the debtor, GSA must have used a mailing address for the debtor
obtained from the IRS pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6103 (m)(2) or (m)(4), within one year preceding
the attempt to notify the debtor.



10557.005

Notice requirement before offset.




The notification provided by GSA to the debtor will inform the debtor how to go about presenting evidence to GSA that
all or part of the debt is either not past due or is not legally enforceable.



10557.006

Consideration of evidence.




Evidence submitted by the debtor will be considered by officials or employees of GSA. Any determination that an amount
of such debt is past due and legally enforceable will be made by such officials or employees. Evidence that the debt
is affected by a bankruptcy proceeding involving the debtor shall bar referral of the debt.



10557.007

Change in conditions after submission to IRS.




If the amount of a debt is reduced after submission by GSA and offset by IRS, GSA will refund to the debtor any excess amount
and will promptly notify IRS of the refund. GSA will also promptly notify the IRS if, after submission of a debt to the
IRS for offset, GSA:


(a) Determines that an error has been made with respect to the information submitted;


(b) Receives a payment or credits a payment to an account submitted; or


(c) Receives notification that the debtor has filed for bankruptcy under Title 11 of the United States Code or has been
adjudicated bankrupt and the debt has been discharged.
