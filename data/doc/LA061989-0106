THE SIDELINES; 
HAWKS-BULLS PROD ILLINOIS ON ARENA 
The owners of the Chicago Blackhawks and Chicago Bulls plan to blitz the 
Illinois General Assembly this week for help in building a hockey-basketball 
palace on Chicago's West Side. 
William Wirtz and Jerry Reinsdorf wanted to make their case three weeks ago, 
but were held up by Mayor Richard M. Daley, who wanted assurances that 70 
families to be displaced by the new arena would be adequately compensated, The 
Chicago Tribune reported today. 
The $110-million arena would seat 22,000 people and accommodate 7,000 cars on a 
lot directly south of the current Chicago Stadium. Wirtz and Reinsdorf are 
seeking a state subsidy to build the arena, the Tribune said. Unlike the new 
White Sox stadium on Chicago's South Side, the Hawks-Bulls arena would be 
privately financed.
