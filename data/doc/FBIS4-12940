  [Text] Occupied Gaza -- Quds Press -- A senior official at 
the PLO office in Gaza has criticized Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres' warning against rapprochement between the 
Palestine National Liberation Movement (Fatah)--the PLO's main 
group which supports the peace process--and the Islamic 
Resistance Movement (Hamas) which opposes the Palestinian 
self-rule accord. 
  Rashid Abu-Shibak, coordinator of the Palestinian police and 
the Israeli Army forces' activities in the occupied Gaza Strip 
said that the issue of rapprochement between Fatah and Hamas 
Movements is an internal issue that concerns only us as 
Palestinians and does not concern any other party. He added: 
Our decision to cooperate is an objective and unquestionable 
decision of our own. 
  Officials from Fatah and Hamas held a meeting in Gaza last 
week to solve problems and differences between the two movements 
in the Gaza Strip. After news of this meeting was revealed the 
day before yesterday, Israeli Foreign Minister Peres addressed a 
warning over Israeli radio that if rapprochement takes place 
between the two biggest organizations in the Palestinian arena, 
then it will be impossible to reach a peace agreement between 
Israel and the PLO.
