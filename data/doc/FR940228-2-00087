ACTION: 

Affirmative Determination under section 1377 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 of a Violation
of a Trade Agreement by Japan.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Section 1377 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 3106) requires the U.S. Trade Representative
(USTR) to review annually the operation and effectiveness of each telecommunications trade agreement in force between
the United States and another country or countries, and to determine whether any act, policy, or practice of the foreign
country that entered into the agreement (1) is not in compliance with the terms of the agreement, or (2) otherwise denies,
within the context of the agreement, mutually advantageous market opportunities to U.S. telecommunications products
and services.



Pursuant to section 1377, USTR has determined that certain practices of Japan with respect to cellular telephone
products and services are not in compliance with Japan's commitments under a June 28, 1989 agreement on third party
radio and cellular telecommunications equipment. Section 1377 requires this affirmative determination to be treated
as an affirmative determination under section 304(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2414(a)(1)(A)).
Accordingly, USTR will request the section 301 Committee to recommend what action, if any, should be taken under section
301 (19 U.S.C. 2411). USTR will publish notice of any proposed action and will provide an opportunity for interested
persons to present views.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 

Questions concerning this affirmative determination should be directed to David Long, Office of Industry Affairs,
(202) 3956160, or Laura B. Sherman, Office of the General Counsel, (202) 3953150, Office of the United
States Trade Representative, 600 Seventh Street, NW., Washington, DC 20506.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This determination is the second affirmative determination under section 1377 on this issue. In the first determination,
made on April 28, 1989 (54 FR 19624), USTR found that, for the reasons cited below, Japan was not in compliance with agreements
on third party radio and cellular telecommunications equipment encompassed in a series of letters and joint communications
between the United States and Japan pursuant to the ``MOSS'' (Market-Oriented Sector-Selective) discussions that
took place between 1985 and 1987.



Specifically, USTR found that the Japanese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) had declined to license
the operation in the Tokyo and Nagoya area of a cellular telephone system based on U.S. technology. This system was
licensed in the rest of Japan, but subscribers to the system could not use their cellular telephones in the Tokyo-Nagoya
area, i.e. they could not ``roam'' into Tokyo-Nagoya. Users of competing Japanese-technology cellular systems
could ``roam'' throughout the country. USTR determined that the failure to approve operation of a U.S. technology-based
system in the Tokyo-Nagoya area was inconsistent with the MOSS agreements, in which the Government of Japan committed
to take measures with respect to roaming in Tokyo-Nagoya by users of the U.S. technology-based system.

Following that determination, consultations led to the June 28, 1989 third party radio and cellular agreement that
is the subject of this determination. In the 1989 agreement, the Government of Japan committed to measures to enable
users of the U.S. technology-based system to roam in the Tokyo-Nagoya region. In the agreement, Japan reaffirmed
its commitment to the principle of ``comparable market access.''

In its review of the 1989 agreement, USTR found the following. To install the U.S. technology-based system in the Tokyo-Nagoya
region, MPT selected, notwithstanding concerns expressed by USTR and U.S. industry, a company that operates a competing
system in the Tokyo-Nagoya area using Japanese technology. This company has substantially delayed installing the
U.S. technology-based system in Tokyo. Nearly five years after the 1989 agreement, and nine years after the MOSS discussions
began, the new system covers only 40 percent of the Tokyo-Nagoya area. As a result, because users of the U.S. technology-based
system still are unable to roam throughout Tokyo-Nagoya, the U.S. technology-based system does not have comparable
market access with the Japanese systems, which offer full geographic coverage.

USTR has consulted with other executive agencies and the private sector during this review, and has had discussions
with the Japanese Government regarding this agreement on more than seven occasions between July, 1993 and February
15, 1994.

As a result of this review, USTR has determined that MPT's failure to ensure full coverage for the U.S. technology-based
system in the Tokyo-Nagoya area nearly five years after the 1989 third party radio and cellular agreement is inconsistent
with the terms of that agreement, and denies, within the context of the terms of that agreement, mutually advantageous
market opportunities in Japan for telecommunications products and services of the United States.
