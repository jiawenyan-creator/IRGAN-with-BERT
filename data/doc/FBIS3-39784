  [Text] Catherine Lalumiere, Council of Europe secretary 
general, has said that it is out of the question for the Council 
to send an observer to the local elections to be held in Turkey 
on 27 March. Lalumiere, who arrived in Turkey today to hold 
talks on regional and international problems, said that the 
Council sends observers to countries that wish to be members in 
a bid to assess the situation in those countries. 
  She added that the situation in the Balkans and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be assessed during her contacts in 
Ankara and that she will also listen to the views of Turkish 
officials on the developments in Russia, the Black Sea, and the 
Caucasus. 
  Expressing concern over the recent bomb attacks in Turkey, 
Lalumiere said that the human rights issue will be assessed 
within this framework. She concluded by saying that she will 
also discuss the Cyprus situation during her talks with Turkish 
officials.
