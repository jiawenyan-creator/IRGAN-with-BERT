  [Text] Holy Mecca, May 15, IRNA -- Following the 
declaration of Dhihajja 4 (this year May 15) as the day of 
solidarity with the Bosnian people, Saudi Minister for Hajj 
Affairs Mahmud Bin-Muhammad al-Safar expressed his opposition to 
the initiative in a note to the head of the Iranian hajj 
pilgrims here today. 
  Al-Safar in his note said he had been informed that Iranian 
hajj headquarters intended to collect aid for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
through several centers in Mecca, Medina and Jeddah airport. 
  "Since no agreements have been reached on the issue earlier, 
I want you to immediately order the officials of the Iranian 
hajj headquarters to give up the initiative," he said, adding 
"Saudi security agents will ban such efforts." 
  Head of the Iranian Hajj pilgrims Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad 
Mohammad Reyshahri, expressing surprise on the remarks, said the 
Saudi Government raised the issue of helping Bosnian Muslims on 
the one hand, and banned the Iranian pilgrims from collecting 
aid for the Bosnian Muslims on the other. 
  "The issue of collecting aid in the way mentioned in the 
letter is not true," Hoj. Reyshahri said in reply. 
  He said Iranian pilgrims prayed for the victory of their 
Bosnian brothers during a ceremony on Saturday night, when they 
were told that they could donate their aid for the Bosnian 
Muslims. 
  A ceremony commemorating the Bosnian martyrs was also held 
at 
the headquarters here today in which Iranian and non-Iranian 
pilgrims expressed their support for their Bosnian brothers and 
sisters. 
  Meanwhile, Saudi commandos, stationed around the 
headquarters 
Sunday afternoon, banned non-Iranian pilgrims from coming to the 
headquarters.
