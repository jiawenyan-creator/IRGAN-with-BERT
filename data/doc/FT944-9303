FT  16 NOV 94 / Observer: Richter scaled
Heaving Helmut Kohl back on to his throne as German chancellor yesterday was
easier said than done.
In order to avoid any last-minute slip-ups, deputies were ordered to report
at 9am sharp, an hour before the Bundestag vote. Six erstwhile missing
deputies made it in time for the vote.
One almost didn't. A pale Roland Richter, a new CDU deputy, careered into
the Bundestag at 10.44 - two minutes before voting ended. He apparently
looked a good deal paler after Wolfgang Schauble, the party's parliamentary
leader, had finished with him.
