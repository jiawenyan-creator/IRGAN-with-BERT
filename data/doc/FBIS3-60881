  [Text] Moscow December 27 TASS -- Regional armed units are 
being engaged to fight terrorists in Georgia, an official from 
the Georgian Interior Ministry told ITAR-TASS by telephone on 
Monday. 
  The units were created by a decree of Eduard Shevardnadze 
and 
will help local law enforcement bodies to disarm illegal armed 
groups and to carry out operations against criminal gangs and 
mafia clans on the territory of the republic. 
  TASS learned from a source in the headquarters resolving 
emergency situations in western Georgia that for the last week 
only police had halted activities of four big armed gangs which 
had been for a long time attacking local residents, policemen 
and administrators.
