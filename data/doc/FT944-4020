FT  10 DEC 94 / Tougher stance on money laundering
Leaders from the Americas and the Caribbean are expected to agree on tougher
measures to combat money laundering at their summit in Miami this weekend.
Final drafts for a declaration of principles due to be issued by the 34
leaders tomorrow call for a co-ordinated strategy to combat drug trafficking
in the hemisphere and to tackle the laundering of money from other
activities, including tax evasion.
'While drug trafficking continues to be a significant source of illegal
funds, the money laundering industry increasingly deals with the proceeds of
all types of criminal activity. An integrated and balanced approach that
includes respect for national sovereignty is essential to confront all
aspects of these problems,' the draft says.
US officials said the inclusion of non-drug offences will vastly widen the
net of regulations to combat money laundering.
It could also have implications for fair trade, by making it more difficult
for companies to obtain an unfair competitive advantage by concealing their
revenues from tax inspectors.
The leaders will agree to order a conference of working level officials on
money laundering, to be followed up by a ministerial conference which may
consider establishing an inter- convention on money laundering.
The money laundering plank of the draft declaration has been strongly pushed
by Colombia, which has often been the butt of other countries' complaints
because of its huge cocaine cartels.
The issue has created friction with some Caribbean countries, as well as the
US and Canada, because of fears that new inter-American rules could conflict
with national bank secrecy laws.
