FT  01 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Rosehaugh
Perhaps the decision to turn off Rosehaugh's life-support machine was only a
formality. Choosing to flick the switch yesterday still seems a little
strange. Banks have been in no rush to crystallise property losses, provided
the troubled company does not require large amounts of new cash. Maybe
having effectively secured the financing of Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments
and ring-fenced its assets they simply regard the low-grade rump of
Rosehaugh as a hopeless case.
Whatever the reason, Rosehaugh is unlikely to mark the start of a trend, if
only because its blend of assets was such an unappetising mix. Rosehaugh's
near-impenetrable web of subsidiary companies and financing agreements is
testament to the excesses of 1980s property lending. It seems improbable
that the company's management had a grip on its sprawling second and third
rate assets. And bank lenders were also far too ready to accept the parent
company's judgment on individual projects.
But the decision will further depress sentiment in a sector which has been
trying to take succour from lower interest rates. It is also a timely
reminder that the banks will not hold on to poorly performing companies for
ever. That may eventually weaken the shares of the large property groups if
asset values and rental yields continue to slip. It will be even more
salutary for those hopefuls who have been driving up the price of property
penny stocks. They have little chance of picking up crumbs from the banks'
table.
