FT  17 AUG 92 / Bullion jury will reconvene today
THE JURY in the Brink's-Mat trial will reconvene today to consider verdicts
on two people accused of laundering proceeds from the Pounds 14m bullion
robbery.
Two of the accused - Mr Gordon Parry, a property developer, and Mr Patrick
Clark, a former nightclub owner - were convicted at the weekend. Mr Parry
was convicted of 10 charges of handling and cleared of one further charge of
handling. Mr Clark was convicted of conspiracy to handle.
Mr Clark's son Stephen was acquitted of taking part in the plot to launder
profits from the 1983 robbery.
The jury has yet to reach verdicts on Ms Jean Savage, a tobacconist, and Mr
Brian Perry, owner of a minicab company.
All the defendants had variously denied charges of handling and conspiracy
to handle proceeds from the raid.
