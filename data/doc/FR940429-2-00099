<DOCTITLE>Secretary of State's Advisory Committee on Private International Law; Study Group on International Procurement;
Meeting</DOCTITLE>



A Study Group of the Secretary of State's Advisory Committee on Private International Law will hold a meeting at 9:30
a.m. until 2 p.m. on Wednesday, May 18th, 1994 in Washington, DC at the International Law Institute, 1615 New Hampshire
Avenue NW.

The Study Group will review proposed provisions of a model law for the procurement of services which is under consideration
by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). UNCITRAL will meet for possible final adoption
of the proposed rules in June 1994. Participants in the Study Group meeting will be asked to provide technical advice
and to make recommendations for possible U.S. positions for the UNCITRAL session.

UNCITRAL recently completed the Model Law on Procurement of Goods and Construction at its Plenary Session in May 1993,
which was endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly by resolution 4833 on December 9, 1993. The text of
the Model Law is printed in the annual report of the Commission's work, U.N. Doc. A/48/17 Annex I and 33 I.L.M. 445 (March
1994). A Guide to Enactment was also prepared to accompany the Model Law (U.N. Doc. A/CN.9/393). The proposed additional
model law provisions covering procurement of services and corresponding changes to the Guide to Enactment are set
out in an annex to the report of the Commission's most recent Working Group meeting on this subject, held at the U.N.
in March 1994 (U.N. Docs. A/CN.9/392 and 394).

The Study Group will review the proposed scope of the UNCITRAL project, including rules on requests for proposals
and other procurement methods for acquisition of services, open access to markets, competitive or restricted bidding,
and related matters.

Copies of the U.N. Documents referred to above and other relevant information may be obtained by contacting Harold
S. Burman by fax at (202) 6539854 or writing the Office of the Assistant Legal Adviser for Private International
Law, L/PIL, Suite 501, 2100 ``K'' Street NW., Washington, DC 200377180.

The Study Group will also review the status of two related international projects, the UNCITRAL Legal Guide on International
Countertrade Transactions, which is now available as United Nations Publication Sales No. E.93.V.7, and the UNIDROIT
Principles for International Commercial Contracts, which is expected to become final in May 1994.

Members of the general public may attend the meeting up to the capacity of the meeting room. The office indicated above
should be notified not later than Thursday, May 12th of the name, affiliation, address and phone number of persons
wishing to attend. In order to facilitate planning for the meeting, members of the public are requested to indicate
