FT  03 MAY 94 / Israeli withdrawal agreement nearing completion
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators yesterday moved 'smoothly' towards
completing final details of the agreement on Israeli withdrawal from Gaza
and Jericho, set for signature in the Egyptian capital tomorrow Mr Nabil
Shaath, the chief PLO negotiator, said yesterday, writes Mark Nicholson in
Cairo. 'We are at the gate of a major achievement for our people and for all
the people in this part of the world,' Mr Shaath said.
More than 2,500 guests and 40 foreign ministers have been invited to Cairo
for the signing ceremony set for tomorrow morning in Cairo. Mr Shaath said
there was no reason to believe the ceremony would be delayed and that the
final Israeli withdrawal would begin 'immediately' thereafter. The first
1,000 of an eventual 9,000-strong Palestinian police force were due to
arrive in Gaza and Jericho by Friday, Mr Shaath said, and adding that some
Palestinian members of a joint co-ordination team to oversee the transition
of police powers left Cairo for Gaza yesterday to begin arrangements for the
Israeli withdrawal.
