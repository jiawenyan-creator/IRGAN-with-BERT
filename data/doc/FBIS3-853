  [Text] Speaking to newsmen shortly after his return from 
the Zimbabwean capital, President of the Republic Joaquim 
Chissano described as pure speculation reports that relations 
between Mozambique and Zimbabwe had cooled down recently. The 
Mozambican head of state had gone to Harare on 13 March on a 
two-day visit. 
  International news agencies and radio stations had 
speculated 
last week that relations between Zimbabwean President Robert 
Mugabe and Joaquim Chissano, his Mozambican counterpart, had 
deteriorated over the last few months. 
  The two heads of state met in Harare to discuss issues 
pertaining to the situation in southern Africa in general and in 
the Frontline countries in particular. President of the 
Republic Joaquim Chissano noted that the situation in Lesotho, 
South Africa, Angola and Zimbabwe itself had been viewed with 
particular interest.
