  [Text] The Nakuru District commissioner, Mr. William 
Kerario, has appealed to the people living at the Nakuru/Narok 
border to remain calm as security personnel tried to solve an 
incident in which raiders believed to be the Kikuyus from 
(Ndefo) farm in Nakuru attacked villagers of (Likia) village and 
escaped with over 150 head of cattle belonging to the Maasai 
before slashing 20 others. 
  Speaking in Nakuru after visiting the area, Mr. Kerario said 
that security has been beefed up in the area. He said a group 
of over 30 men from (Ndefo) farm crossed the border and attacked 
the villagers yesterday morning. 
  Following the incident, Mr. Kerario added that Maasai morans 
[warriors] grouped and pursued the raiders who they also 
attacked, killing four of them before the others took off with 
the animals. Mr. Kerario said that quick action by police who 
received the information managed to recover 22 of the animals at 
(Ndefo) farm and arrested 44 suspects, eight of whom were 
positively identified by (Likia) villagers as part of the 
raiders. He said that police also recovered a homemade gun at 
the scene of the fight. 
  Terming the incident as a deliberate move by some people to 
revive the tribal clashes in the area, Mr. Kerario said that the 
government viewed this seriously. He said that the incident 
happened only two days after another group of raiders attacked 
Ndorobos [tribe] and stole their animals at Marioshoni Forest in 
the district, and vowed that the government will act swiftly 
and firmly to ensure that peace prevailed. At the same time 
Mr. Kerario appealed to residents of the affected areas to 
assist the police with any information that could lead to the 
recovery of the animals and arrest the culprits. He assured 
those who lost their animals that they will be returned to them 
as soon as they are recovered.
