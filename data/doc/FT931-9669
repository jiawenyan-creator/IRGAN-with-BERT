FT  12 FEB 93 / Vauxhall to supply Corsas to BSM driving schools
VAUXHALL has won a five-year contract to supply the driving school group BSM
 -the British School of Motoring - with its new Corsa small car.
The exclusive supply contract was previously held by Rover group, which
delivered up to 5,000 Metros annually to BSM for the past decade.
The deal with Vauxhall has a five-year extension option.
If exercised, Vauxhall would supply 50,000 Corsas over 10 years in a deal
worth Pounds 400m at showroom prices.
Typically such large fleet deals involve substantial discounts. Neither BSM
or Vauxhall would discuss the discount issue yesterday, describing the deal
as a joint marketing arrangement going well beyond the supply relationship
BSM previously maintained with Rover.
BSM, which has 2,000 driving instructors franchised at 130 branches, is
increasingly interested in tapping the growing market for the advanced
instruction of company car users.
Vauxhall has a leading share of the company car market, and should be able
to help BSM achieve this aim.
For its part, Vauxhall expects to benefit from the wide exposure the Corsa
can expect to receive as the BSM's only 'school' car. The General Motors
subsidiary wants to attract young drivers to the model.
Deliveries are to start in July, three months after the Spanish-built Corsa
goes on sale in the UK.
The Corsa, which will replace the Nova in the UK and is also to be built at
Eisenach in eastern Germany, is expected by GM to become one of Europe's
biggest-selling cars.
GM invested more than Pounds 500m in its development and production, and
plans to produce more than 500,000 units a year.
