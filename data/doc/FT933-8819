FT  13 AUG 93 / Arts: Today's Television
Given that the Friday night schedules are currently chock-a-block with
rubbish and repeats it looks as though ITV's Survival Special will have a
clear run at the ratings. This is an hour-long account of Prince Charles'
'nature friendly' methods of gardening and farming at Highgrove, filmed over
two years by wildlife expert Maurice Tibbles. The prince, who began his
organic regime with 85 acres in 1985, has now brought the whole 1,112 acre
estate under his non-chemical scheme (9.00 ITV).
There are two Proms both relayed live from the Albert Hall on Radio 3. At
7.00 composer Peter Maxwell Davies conducts the BBC Philharmonic in
Mendelssohn's 'Hebrides' overture and Beethoven's 4th piano concerto
(soloist Barry Douglas) and, at 8.10, his own Symphony No 2. Then, in a
concert at 10.00, Jane Glover conducts Hungarian pianists Peter Frankl and
Tamas Vasary and the BBC Singers in the original version of Brahms'
'Liebslieder' waltzes.
Radio 4 begins a new series which promises to 'demystify the arcane workings
of the medical profession': Struck Off And Die (11.00).
