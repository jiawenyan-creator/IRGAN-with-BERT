 

Employer X decides not to amend Plan Y to provide for the adjustments permitted under 1.401(a)(4)13(d)
to the accrued benefit of section 401(a)(17) employees as of December 31, 1988.

(b) Under Plan Y, Employee A's accrued benefit at the end of 1989 is $25,000, which is the greater of Employee A's accrued
benefit as of the last day of the 1988 plan year ($25,000), and $24,000, which is Employee A's benefit based on the plan's
benefit formula applied to Employee A's total years of service ($200,000 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 6
years of service)). The formula of Plan Y applicable to section 401(a)(17) employees for calculating their accrued
benefits for years after the section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date is the formula in 1.401(a)13(c)(4)(ii)
(formula with wear-away). The fresh-start formula is applied using a benefit formula for the 1989 plan year that satisfies
section 401(a)(17) and this section, and the December 31, 1988 fresh-start date used for the plan is a section 401(a)(17)
fresh-start date within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, Plan Y, as amended, satisfies
paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section for plan years commencing prior to the OBRA '93 effective date.



Example 2. 

Assume the same facts as in 

Example 1, 

except that the plan formula provides that effective January 1, 1989, for section 401(a)(17) employees, an employee's
benefit will equal the sum of the employee's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1988 (determined as though the employee
terminated employment on that date and without regard to any amendments after that date), and 2 percent of compensation
averaged over an employee's high 3 consecutive years' compensation times years of service taking into account only
years of service after December 31, 1988. Thus, under Plan Y's formula, Employee A's accrued benefit as of December
31, 1989 is $29,000, which is equal to the sum of $25,000 (Employee A's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1988) plus
$4,000 ($200,000 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 1 year of service)). The formula of Plan Y applicable to section
401(a)(17) employees for calculating their accrued benefits for years after the section 401(a)(17) fresh-start
date is the formula in 1.401(a)13(c)(4)(i) (formula without wear-away). The fresh-start formula
is applied using a benefit formula for the 1989 plan year that satisfies section 401(a)(17) and this section, and the
December 31, 1988 fresh-start date used for the plan is a section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date within the meaning of
paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, Plan Y, as amended, satisfies paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section for
plan years commencing prior to the OBRA '93 effective date.



Example 3. 

(a) Assume the same facts as in 

Example 1, 

except that the plan formula provides that effective January 1, 1989, an employee's benefit equals the greater of
the plan formulas in 

Example 1 

and 

Example 2. 

The formula of Plan Y applicable to section 401(a)(17) employees for calculating their accrued benefits for years
after the section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date is the formula in 1.401(a)13(c)(4)(iii) (formula with
extended wear-away). The fresh-start formula is applied using a benefit formula for the 1989 plan year that satisfies
section 401(a)(17) and this section, and the December 31, 1988 fresh-start date used for the plan is a section 401(a)(17)
fresh-start date within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, Plan Y, as amended, satisfies
paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section for plan years commencing prior to the OBRA '93 effective date.

(b) Assume that for each of the years 199193 Employee A's annual compensation under the plan compensation formula,
disregarding the amendment to comply with section 401(a)(17) is $300,000. The annual compensation limit is adjusted
to $222,220, $228,860, and $235,840 for plan years beginning January 1, 1991, 1992, and 1993, respectively. Because
Employer X has decided to amend Plan Y to comply with the provisions of this section effective for plan years beginning
on or after January 1, 1989, and has used December 31, 1988 as the section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date, the compensation
that may be taken into account for plan benefits in 1993 cannot exceed $228,973 (the average of $222,220, $228,860,
and $235,840). Therefore, as of December 31, 1993, the benefit determined under the fresh-start formula with wear-away
would be $45,795 ($228,973 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 10 years of service)). The benefit determined under
the fresh-start formula without wear-away would be $47,897, which is equal to $25,000 (Employee A's section 401(a)(17)
frozen accrued benefit) plus $22,897 ($228,973 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 5 years of service)). Because
Employee A's accrued benefit is being determined using the fresh-start formula with extended wear-away, Employee
A's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1993, is equal to $47,897, the greater of the two amounts.



Example 4. 

(a) Assume the same facts as in 

Example 3, 


except that Plan Y satisfies 1.401(a)(4)13(d)(3) through (d)(7) and that the amendment to Plan Y effective
for plan years beginning after December 31, 1988, also provided for adjustments to the section 401(a)(17) frozen
accrued benefit in accordance with 1.401(a)(4)-13(d) using the fraction described in 1.401(a)(4)-13(d)(8)(i).

(b) As of December 31, 1993, the numerator of Employee A's compensation fraction is $228,973 (the average of Employee
A's annual compensation for 1991, 1992, and 1993, as limited by the respective annual limit for each of those years).
The denominator of Employee A's compensation fraction determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this
section is $250,000 (the average of Employee A's high 3 consecutive calendar year compensation as of December 31,
1988, determined without regard to section 401(a)(17)). Therefore, Employee A's compensation fraction is $228,973/$250,000.
Because the compensation adjustment fraction is less than 1, Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit
is not adjusted. Therefore, Employee A's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1993, would still be $47,897, which is
equal to $25,000 (Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit) plus $22,897 ($228,973 multiplied by
(2 percent multiplied by 5 years of service).



Example 5. 

(a) Assume the same facts as in 

Example 3, 


except that as of January 1, 1994, Plan Y is amended to provide that benefits will be determined based on compensation
of $150,000 (the limit in effect under section 401(a)(17) for plan years beginning on or after the OBRA '93 effective
date) and that for section 401(a)(17) employees, each employee's accrued benefit will be determined under 1.401(a)(4)13(c)(4)(i)
(formula without wear-away) using December 31, 1993 as the OBRA '93 fresh-start date.

(b) Assume that for each of the years 199698 Employee A's annual compensation under the plan compensation definition,
disregarding the amendment to comply with section 401(a)(17), is $400,000. Assume that the annual compensation
limit is first adjusted to $160,000 for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1997, and is not adjusted for the
plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1998. The compensation that may be taken into account for the 1998 plan year
cannot exceed $156,667 (the average of $150,000 for 1996, $160,000 for 1997, and $160,000 for 1998).

(c) Therefore, at the end of December 31, 1998, Employee A's accrued benefit is $63,564, which is equal to $47,897 (Employee
A's OBRA '93 frozen accrued benefit) plus $15,667 ($156,667 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 5 years of service)).



Example 6. 

(a) Assume the same facts as in 

Example 5, 


except that, for the fresh-start group (in this case the section 401(a)(17) employees), the amendments to Plan Y provide
for adjustments to the section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit and the OBRA '93 frozen accrued benefit in accordance
with 1.401(a)(4)13(d) using the fraction described in 1.401(a)(4)13(d)(8)(i).

(b) Employee A's frozen accrued benefit as of December 31, 1993, is adjusted as of December 31, 1998, as follows: (1)
Employee A's frozen accrued benefit as of December 31, 1993, is the sum of Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued
benefit ($25,000) and Employee A's frozen accruals for the years 198993 ($22,897).

(2) The numerator of Employee A's adjustment fraction is $156,667 (the average of $150,000, $160,000, and $160,000).
The denominator of Employee A's adjustment fraction with respect to Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued
benefit is $250,000, and the denominator of Employee A's adjustment fraction with respect to the rest of Employee
A's frozen accrued benefit is $228,973 (the average of Employee A's annual compensation for 1991, 1992, and 1993,
as limited by the respective annual limit for each of those years).

(3) Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit as adjusted through December 31, 1998, remains $25,000.
The compensation adjustment fraction determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section is less
than one ($156,667 divided by $250,000).

(4) Employee A's frozen accruals for the years 198993, as adjusted through December 31, 1998, remain $22,897
because the adjustment fraction is less than one ($156,667 divided by $228,973).

(5) Employee A's adjusted accrued benefit as of December 31, 1998, equals $47,897 (the sum of the $25,000 and $22,897
amounts from paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4), respectively, of this 

Example

).

(c) Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit will not be adjusted for compensation increases until
the numerator of the fraction used to adjust that frozen accrued benefit exceeds the denominator of $250,000 used
in determining those accruals.

Similarly, the portion of Employee A's OBRA '93 frozen accrued benefit attributable to the frozen accruals for the
years 19891993 will not be adjusted for compensation increases until the numerator of the fraction used to
adjust those frozen accruals exceeds the denominator of $228,973 used in determining those accruals.
