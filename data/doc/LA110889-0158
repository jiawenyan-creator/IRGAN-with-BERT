NAMES IN THE NEWS; 
HOMETOWN BLASE ABOUT SINGER 
Anne Murray has sold 20 million albums worldwide, but the folks back in 
Springhill, Nova Scotia, do not seem impressed. 
Murray, who lives in Toronto, also recalled an acquaintance from her old 
hometown, a small mining community, who expressed surprise at hearing Murray's 
records on the radio during a trip to faraway Florida. 
When the Anne Murray Centre opened last summer in Springhill, hundreds of 
people went through the museum, Murray said during a recent interview here. 
"It was so funny because they see this center -- and I think they underestimate 
the impact that I've had or the people that I've reached," the singer said.
