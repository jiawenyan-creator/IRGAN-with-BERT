FT  01 JUN 94 / Shift on sale of Polish insurer
Poland's finance ministry has dropped plans to break up PZU, the country's
largest insurer. It will privatise the state-owned company as a whole, in
line with management suggestions. Mr Roman Fulneczek, PZU president, argues
that the company should be kept together to better face the challenge of the
liberalisation of the country's insurance market in 1999. PZU which reported
a 325bn zloty (Pounds 9.6m) net profit last year controls about half
Poland's fledgling insurance market. The decision includes devoting around
800bn zlotys worth of profits earned by PZU Zycie, a wholly-owned
subsidiary, to plug a 1,600bn zloty gap in PZU's reserves. This would avoid
the need to draw on a Dollars 200m loan offered by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development to underpin a government bond issue designed
to bolster PZU's finances. The ministry also appears to have accepted PZU
management's three-year privatisation strategy.
