FT  13 MAY 94 / Clarke demands support for Major
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday sought to rule out a challenge
to Mr John Major's leadership by warning that the Conservative party was
'finished' unless it rallied round the prime minister.
In a tough speech to the Scottish Conservative party conference in
Inverness, reinforced in comments to journalists, Mr Clarke tied the future
of the government firmly to the survival of the prime minister.
'We will be finished if we do not support the prime minister from now until
the next general election and beyond. The Conservative party has remained in
power for so long because it has a readily identifiable set of principles,
and because it has held together as a cohesive party of government,' he
said.
'The leader deserves loyalty and we will stay in office if we stay behind
him.'
Mr Clarke's warning, delivered before news filtered through to the
conference of the death of Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, follows similar
declarations of support for Mr Major from Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, and Mr Michael Forsyth, the rightwing employment minister.
The chancellor dismissed claims by Mr Henning Christopherson, vice-president
of the European Commission, that UK economic growth was likely to slow from
2.5 per cent this year to 2.3 per cent in 1995-96 because of tax increases.
Mr Clarke said Mr Christopherson's analysis - delivered in the commission's
latest assesment of the economic prospects of the European Union's member
states - was 'out of date'. He said there were plenty of data to show that
tax increases were not slowing consumer demand.
