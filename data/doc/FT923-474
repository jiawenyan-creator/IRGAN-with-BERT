FT  29 SEP 92 / Observer: Executive tools
Recession, what recession? Air London, which arranges air taxis for rich
people and tired executives, says that its business in September was 10 per
cent up on the same month last year. Among its recent clients were six
investment analysts who chartered a Citation jet for a week to ferry them
between Heathrow - Biarritz - St Etienne - Friedrichshafen - Dusseldorf -
Bilbao - Madrid - and back home. Cost Pounds 13,000. Sadly, their names must
remain secret.
'Could be price-sensitive information, old boy,' says Air London.
