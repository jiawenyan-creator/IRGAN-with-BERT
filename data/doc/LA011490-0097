BIG WEST CONFERENCE ROUNDUP; 
UNLV REPELS TEMPLE'S LATE CHARGE 
With 3 minutes 47 seconds left Saturday at Philadelphia, Nevada Las Vegas 
seemed to have control of its nonconference game against Temple. 
The Rebels had a 74-62 lead, and three Temple starters had fouled out. 
This was a game the seventh-ranked Rebels (10-3) surely would win. 
But Temple outscored UNLV, 12-2, to close within two points with 50 seconds 
left. Then Larry Johnson took over, making six consecutive free throws in the 
final 34 seconds as UNLV held on for an 82-76 victory over the Owls (6-6). 
"I just took my time, took a deep breath and got ready," Johnson said of his 
free throws. 
Each team was charged with 28 personal fouls. 
"It was a strange ballgame," UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian said. "I'm surprised we 
were leading at the half because we didn't shoot very well." 
The Rebels held a 40-37 halftime lead. 
An NCAA investigation into an unpaid loan kept Anderson Hunt out of the Las 
Vegas lineup. 
"Based on a university audit, it has been determined that junior guard Anderson 
Hunt has a school loan which has not yet been fully repaid," UNLV Assistant 
Athletic Director Joyce Aschenbrenner said. 
Hunt said it was a misunderstanding because he thought the loan had been 
repaid. 
Utah State 77, San Jose State 72 -- Kendall Youngblood scored 15 points and the 
Aggies made the final six points at Logan, Utah. 
Randy Funk had 13 points for Utah State (9-6, 3-1), which outshot San Jose 
State, 59% to 43%. 
Kenne Young led San Jose State (4-9, 1-3) with 16 points and 13 rebounds, and 
Mike Wasserburger scored 14 points.
