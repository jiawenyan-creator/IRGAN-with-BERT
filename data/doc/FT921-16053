FT  07 JAN 92 / Letter: Telling examples of competitive inertia
Sir, Six months ago I put out for quotation by a toolmaker a drawing for a
blow-moulding tool. It took five weeks and three prodding telephone calls
before I received his quotation on the telephone which was 'around Pounds
18,000'; and the drawing would have to be amended so that the toolmakers
could make a tool which they could make.
A visit to Portugal produced an estimate within five minutes; and the
estimate was just under Pounds 7,000.
I recently asked a well-known West End optician to have my spectacle frames
polished, to which the response was 'we can't do it in England; they will
thus have to go to Germany which will take three weeks and the cost will be
Pounds 95'. In Stuttgart last weekend I walked into the first optician's
shop I came across and had the job done in a quarter of an hour for Pounds
5.
