FT  01 JUN 94 / Observer: Joint plea for a downer
We now all know that president Clinton never inhaled. No such shyness from
Aussie politicos.
Hours into her new job, the irrepressible Bronwyn Bishop, the Liberal
Party's health spokeswoman, announced she supported tobacco advertising.
When Carmen Lawrence, federal health minister, berated Bishop for this
attitude, Bishop countered by recalling Lawrence's admission that she had
used marijuana and 'lived to tell the tale'.
With Swiftian wit, the health minister riposted by saying that Bishop's boss
Alexander Downer, had said much the same about his encounters with the weed,
which perhaps explains why he has been picked as the new head of the
Australian opposition.
Prime minister Paul Keating - former manager of rock band The Ramrods - is
in the clear: 'The heaviest I got was a few cases of beer behind the stage
after a concert,' he recently acknowledged.
But despite all this badinage, Canberra wits suggest the real problem with
local politicians is that they all remember to exhale.
