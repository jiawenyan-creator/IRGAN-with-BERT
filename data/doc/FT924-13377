FT  15 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Turkey casts doubt on WEU entry
offer
TURKEY has formally warned its allies that without substantial changes it
may be unable to recommend to parliament the current offer of associate
membership of the 9-nation Western European Union (WEU) defence
organisation.
Mr Ozden Sanberk, undersecretary at the Turkish Foreign Ministry, told
European ambassadors that Ankara wants full WEU participation, including
voting rights on issues directly affecting its security, and where it has
committed troops. Not being a signatory to the WEU Treaty, diplomats say
Turkey is demanding its associate status be enshrined in a separate legal
document. As a Nato member, but not an EC partner, Turkey, with Norway and
Iceland, was offered associate membership of the WEU.
Turkey's Motherland party, the main opposition party, has stated it will
vote against ratification of the WEU offer when it comes to parliament. With
the coalition now under strain following recent defections of some 18 social
democrat deputies, there is every possibility the government would lose such
a vote.
