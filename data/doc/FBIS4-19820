  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- Lebanese terrorist Ali 'Abbas 
Hamadi, who was deported from Germany last year, is reportedly 
back in the FRG. This was learned from security circles on 
Thursday [21 April] morning. According to information that has 
not been officially confirmed, he plans to free his brother 
Muhamad Ali Hamadi, who is serving a life term in the Hesse 
prison of Schwalmstadt for hijacking a plane and killing a U.S. 
soldier. The Federal Office of Criminal Investigations in 
Wiesbaden has not been able to confirm these reports so far. 
  It was also said that this information comes from French 
intelligence service circles. 'Abbas Hamadi is reportedly 
planning an operation to force his brother's release. 
Allegedly, he is in the area of Saarbruecken at the moment. 
  'Abbas Hamadi, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 
1988 for taking hostages and illegal possession of explosives, 
was released from prison last year after having served about 
half of his sentence and was deported from Germany.
