FT  08 MAR 94 / Observer: Grow slow
Whereas John Major's predecessor used BBC Radio's Jimmy Young show to boost
her loyal following among Britain's housewives, the main impact of Mr
Major's appearance yesterday was to confuse the financial markets. An alert
Reuters hack picked up the PM's comments that Britain's GDP growth was
currently 2 per cent, with 2.5 per cent forecast for 'next year'. In fact,
the government is predicting 2.5 per cent growth for this year and the
Treasury confirmed that there was no change in its forecast.
So did the Prime Minister get the figures wrong, or is he simply confused
about which year it is?
