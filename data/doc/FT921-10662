FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: DSM to divest computer arm
DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, has signed a letter of intent on
transferring its computer services and software department to Raet, a Dutch
automation group, as part of its policy of 'outsourcing' non-core staff and
service activities to other companies.
The computer department, which is called Computer Centrum Nederland, employs
300 people. It has an annual turnover of about Fl 90m (Dollars 50m), of
which 15 per cent is generated outside DSM.
The divestment, if completed, would involve the second biggest transfer of a
DSM staff department to another company since the chemicals group
transferred its 460-employee maintenance department to Stork, the Dutch
engineering group, in Jan-uary.
As in the case of maintenance, the computer department will continue to work
for DSM after ownership is transferred to Raet.
As part of its long-term strategy, DSM is seeking to focus on core
businesses as well as carrying out a policy of further decentralisation. A
decision on the computer services sale is expected later this year.
