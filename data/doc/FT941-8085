FT  22 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bond market declines push
shares lower
Friday's free fall in US long bonds gave bourses another bad day, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT returned to the real world, said Mr Edgar Benischek, head of
trading at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt. The big financials, such as
Allianz, Deutsche Bank and Dresdner, had studiously ignored a falling bund
market last week, he said, with options expiring on Friday; yesterday they
dropped with the Dax index which closed the session 32.44 lower at 2,119.53,
the Ibis-indicated Dax easing later to 2,108.06.
The Bund future, said Mr Benischek, was the key to the decline; it dropped
87 basis points to 97.24 yesterday after a rough Friday in New York.
Turnover fell from DM9.9bn to DM6.4bn. Story led stocks were clearly
uncomfortable. Metallgesellschaft dropped another DM20.50 to DM175.50 ahead
of today's results conference; BMW, with Honda planning to sell its equity
stake in Rover, fell DM19.50 to DM848, and shed another DM8 after hours on
profit-taking after last week's 8 per cent gain.
Mannesmann, a recent Anglo-Saxon choice on its cellular telephone prospects,
lost DM8.50 to DM428 on the session and another DM4 in the afternoon. PWA,
the papermaker, which had led the market early this year on its cyclical
recovery prospects, fell DM10, or more than 4 per cent to DM228 on a group
net loss of DM240m.
PARIS was disappointed on a number of counts: weakness in the bond market,
lack of a rate cut from the Bank of France and worries over the direction of
Wall Street when it re-opens later today.
On the last day of the account the CAC-40 index lost 36.58 or 1.6 per cent
to 2,215.20.
Turnover was moderate at FFr4.6bn.
Elf Aquitaine continued to fall back in heavy volume, the shares losing
FFr3.80 to FFr415.00.
AMSTERDAM featured a steep fall in Nedlloyd as the market reacted to a
larger than expected convertible bond issue, the shares dipping Fl 3.20 to
Fl 74.80.
The AEX index closed off 1.33 to 425.53.
Unilever, with results due today, and Akzo, which is expected to report
later in the week, both advanced by Fl 2.30, to Fl 227.80 and Fl 215.90
respectively.
MILAN produced some winners as the Comit index lost 4.48 to 684.55 in thin
trading.
Fiat added L15 to L4,965, after a low of L4,880, in spite of protests and
last-minute wrangling which delayed final agreement on a key deal with
unions to shed 16,500 jobs.
Banks saw BCI climb a further L52 to L6,221 ahead of its privatization at
the end of the month; longer term privatization prospects for Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro and recent management changes helped the savings shares
L1,527 or 10.9 per cent higher to L15,540; and Banco di Napoli rose by L195,
or 9.2 per cent to L2,315 on speculation that it could be added to the list
of privatisation candidates.
MADRID, one of the European markets picked out for growth by the strategists
this year, had profits left to take after a gentle decline last week. The
general index tumbled by 7.10 to 338.36 in turnover of Pta25.7bn.
Dealers said that the downtrend was stronger at the end of the day. Banks
and electrical utilities led the way down, with Argentaria Pta230 off at
Pta6,300 and Sevillana Pta29 lower at Pta772.
ZURICH edged lower in quiet trading as weakness in the bond market continued
to weigh on equities. The SMI index shed 28.3 to 2,997.6.
Mr Simon Marshall Lockyer at Kleinwort Benson, who maintains a neutral
weighting on the Swiss market, noted that profit-taking in financials, and
particularly the insurance sector as the reporting season began had
contributed to the flat performance of Swiss market, compared with the FT-A
Europe ex-UK, over the last month. However, a sharp fall in January
inflation to 2.1 per cent suggested that further cuts in domestic interest
rate cuts were possible, although large reductions were more likely
elsewhere, which suggested an end to the trading run in the bank and
insurers.
ISTANBUL resumed a downward course after Friday's advance with a fall of
10.5 per cent in the composite index, which lost 2,024.52 to 17,250.12.
Trading remains volatile, with investors still attracted by high money
market rates: the central bank raised overnight interest rate to 110 per
cent yesterday from 90 per cent.
WARSAW remained confident. In spite of a sharp fall in Bank Slaski, which
lost 8.7 per cent to 4.2m zlotys, the WIG index rose 299 or 1.6 per cent to
a record 19,358.3 in turnover of 3,700bn zlotys.
Last Thursday, Bank Slaski's stockbroking licence was revoked. Late on
Friday, however, the stock exchange said that it would not suspend trade in
the bank; the finance ministry felt that new shareholders had been
penalised, because trading had begun before everyone had registered their
stock.
TEL AVIV dropped as small investors, acting through mutual funds, dumped
stocks into institutional hands following stock exchange investigations into
alleged insider trading and share-price manipulation. The Mishtanim index
lost 11.04 or 4.9 per cent to 214.99.
ATHENS closed 4.9 per cent higher as hopes grew that a peaceful solution to
the Bosnia crisis lay ahead. The general index added 51.82 to 1,119.7 in
volume of 1.8m shares.
