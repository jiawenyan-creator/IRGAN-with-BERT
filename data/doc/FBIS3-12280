  [Text] Damascus, (SANA)--Ahmad Jabril, secretary general of 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
Command [PFLP-GC], has said the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is a 
natural extension of the Zionist enemy settler practices against 
our Palestinian people. 
  In a statement distributed here today, Jibril added that the 
savage massacre, which was perpetrated by the Zionist enemy 
against a gathering of Palestinian worshipers, is a fruit of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement that gave the settler Zionist enemy a 
short-cut to legitimizing its occupation of Palestinian Arab 
territories. 
  Jibril said: The determination of our Palestinian Arab 
people and Arab and Islamic nation will punish those who 
conceded our sanctities, territories, and history. He 
emphasized in conclusion that the Palestinian people inside the 
occupied homeland and in the diaspora will not forgive the 
killers their deed, and their revenge will be great. The savage 
massacre will increase our people's and our nation's firmness, 
determination, and confidence in the inevitable triumph.
