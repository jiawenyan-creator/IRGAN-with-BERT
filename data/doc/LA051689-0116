WILDERNESS AGAIN SEEKING CHAPTER 11 
Wilderness Experience, the beleaguered Chatsworth camping gear firm, for the 
second time in two years has sought shelter from creditors by filing for 
Chapter 11 protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
According to its bankruptcy filing May 5, Wilderness Experience has assets of 
$627,400 and debts of $1.4 million. Among the debts are $43,500 owed to the 
accounting firm Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells, and $6,483 to the Los Angeles 
Department of Water &amp; Power. 
William Hess, Wilderness Experience's attorney, said the company's latest 
problems stemmed partly from its inability to deliver on time a $5-million shoe 
order to a major retailer, because Wilderness "didn't have the capital." 
The company has also been behind in payments to its landlords, and those debts 
helped force its bankruptcy filing. 
Bernard Kramer, the company's president, said he has closed three of the 
company's six retail stores to cut costs, although its factory remains open and 
is manufacturing sportswear and backpacks. To help cut costs, the company has 
laid off about 25 workers, Kramer said, and has only about 45 employees now. 
"We believe we can recapitalize the company and go forward. We will consolidate 
the operation by reducing overhead, going to smaller headquarters," Kramer 
said. 
In June, 1987, the company filed for Chapter 11 protection and emerged from 
bankruptcy proceedings in April, 1988. The company's bank and some of its other 
creditors forgave 75% of Wilderness' debts in exchange for some of the 
company's stock. Wilderness was also able to raise $360,000 from investors. 
This time, Kramer hopes to reorganize once again and emerge from bankruptcy 
protection by "trying to sell or merge the company with a larger company." He 
said Wilderness still has a "large pool of stockholders who are very interested 
in helping the company continue," and some might be willing to provide 
additional capital. 
One shareholder who won't invest more money is Herve Babineau of Malibu. At the 
urging of a friend, he bought 13,200 shares of Wilderness' stock at 50 cents a 
share in hopes of catching the company on the rebound. He has since sold most 
of his stock at a loss. 
But he said, "I'm going to write things off," get a tax credit for the loss and 
use it to help invest in something else.
