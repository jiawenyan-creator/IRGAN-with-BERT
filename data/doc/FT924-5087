FT  28 NOV 92 / Letter: Pension fund trustees have no business changing
benefits
Sir, Mr Pritchard (Letters, November 26) is to be congratulated for his
appreciation that it is a duty of pension scheme trustees 'to ensure that
the fund can meet its liabilities in the long term and on an unexpected
near-term winding-up.' This important duty to ensure proper funding of
defined benefits seems to have evaded both the Occupational Pensions Board
in its booklet 'Pension Trust Principles' and the Goode Committee in its
consultative document.
However, it is no business of pension scheme trustees 'to elect to move away
from defined benefit schemes and to adopt defined contribution plans'. The
trustees may have a duty to wind up a final salary scheme if they consider
the employer is not able or willing to fund it to the standard the trustees
consider necessary, but it is not their job to change the benefits. They are
trustees of the trust deed, not arbiters of any aspect of the
employer/employee relationship. If the trustees consider they must wind up a
scheme, it is for the employer to decide what to put in its place.
It would be sensible to find an intermediate solution between fully defined
final salary schemes and defined contribution money purchase schemes. This
would spread the uncertainties and associated risks more realistically and
fairly between employers and employees.
The government should facilitate such a development, whereas present
policies will polarise schemes.
