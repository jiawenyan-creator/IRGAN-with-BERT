  [Text] Sofia, December 15 (BTA) -- Bulgaria's Minister of 
the Environment Valentin Bosevski and Romania's visiting 
Minister of Waters, Forestry and Environment Protection Aurel 
Constantin Ilie today initialed the statutes of an 
intergovernmental commission to supervise the implementation of 
the bilateral convention on cooperation in environmental 
protection signed in Romania on May 12, 1993. The commission 
will hold its first sitting in early February, Bosevski told the 
press. 
  The ministers discussed the work on a regional programme for 
the environmental protection of the lower Danube. We think this 
programme can now only be implemented with intellectual and 
financial assistance from the European Union, Bosevski also 
said. He said this would not be unprecedented, as such 
programmes are under way in Central Europe. 
  The ministers agreed to sign in Giurgiu (Romania) on 
December 
27 a memorandum to the EC asking support for the implementation 
of the Regional Programme for Environmental Protection of the 
Lower Danube. The memorandum will be handed to the EC by January 
15. 
  "The time of promises has passed. My view, shared by Mr. 
Ilie, is that we shall be looking for pragmatic models to 
resolve environmental problems," said Bosevski. He said the 
Romanian side invited Bulgarian experts to visit the 
construction site of the N-plant [nuclear plant] in Cerna Voda.
