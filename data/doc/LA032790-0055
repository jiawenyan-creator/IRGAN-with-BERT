SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : EL CAJON 
A prisoner accused of trying to escape from the El Cajon jail while awaiting 
trial on charges of murdering an El Cajon woman was ordered Monday to stand 
trial on escape charges. 
Raymond Harry Stone, 41, was ordered to stand trial by Municipal Judge Nicholas 
Kasimatis after a 10-minute preliminary hearing. 
Prosecutors allege that Stone and two other men attempted to escape from the El 
Cajon jail Feb. 27 after they made a hole in the wall and used sheets to 
descend to the roof of the adjacent courthouse, where Stone was found in a 
stairwell a few minutes later. 
Stone, who appeared in court wearing shackles, will be arraigned in Superior 
Court on April 9. 
He will also be tried on murder, burglary and theft charges related to the 
killing of Anita Dalfoss, 50, who was last seen about one year ago. That 
proceeding is scheduled to begin July 16. 
He was convicted last fall on separate grand theft and burglary charges, after 
he charmed women and stole their money. He is serving a nine-year sentence.
