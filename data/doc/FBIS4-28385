  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai received Xie Shijie, 
secretary of Sichuan Provincial Chinese Communist Party 
Committee, and his friendship economic relation delegation at 
government house yesterday afternoon. The two sides exchanged 
views on economic and investment cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  Secretary Xie Shijie said that investment cooperation 
between 
Sichuan Province and Thai businessmen is growing fast, 
especially in the financial field. Bangkok Bank will be the 
first foreign bank to be allowed to set up an office in Chengdu 
city soon. Prime Minister Chuan thanked Xie Shijie in this 
regard. He hoped that the Chinese side would support Bangkok 
Bank's business operation in China to help expand bilateral 
economic and trade cooperation between the two countries, a 
common policy of both countries. 
  The nine-member delegation from Sichuan will conclude its 
visit to Thailand on 9 June.
