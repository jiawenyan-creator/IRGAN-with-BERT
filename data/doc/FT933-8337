FT  17 AUG 93 / Germany's capacity utilisation stabilises
CAPACITY utilisation in western German industry has stabilised after more
than two years of decline, the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute
reported yesterday.
Manufacturing and mining equipment, excluding food and drink, was working at
78.3 per cent of capacity during June, barely changed from 78.6 per cent in
March.
The average volume of outstanding orders, sufficient for 2.5 months, was
also unchanged over the three-month period. The figures add weight to other
recent evidence that the recession may have reached its low point.
However, most of the companies surveyed suggested utilisation rates would
remain unsatisfactory at least for the next 12 months.
They are still well below the 10-year average rate of around 85 per cent,
and the peak of almost 90 per cent recorded in the third quarter of 1990.
The Ifo survey showed that conditions in some important industrial sectors
were continuing to deteriorate. Utilisation rates among investment goods
makers were 75.7 per cent in June compared with 76.6 per cent three months
earlier. The figures for consumer non-durables makers also fell from 85.9
per cent to 84 per cent.
