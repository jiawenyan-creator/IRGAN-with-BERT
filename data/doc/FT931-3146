FT  17 MAR 93 / Seoul plays down N Korea tension
SOUTH KOREAN defence officials said yesterday they had not detected any
unusual military activity in North Korea in spite of the country being
placed on a 'semi-war' footing last week.
Pyongyang took the step in response to the large US-South Korean Team Spirit
military exercise, while also withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty.
The Seoul officials said current military movements in North Korea were
consistent with battle mobilisation measures taken in reaction to previous
Team Spirit exercises, which have been held since 1976.
Mr Kwon Young-hae, South Korean defence minister, told the National Assembly
that Seoul had consulted Washington on the possibility of some of the US
troops taking part in Team Spirit staying in South Korea after the exercise
ends tomorrow.
But defence officials said if North Korean military activity remained
normal, this request was unlikely to be made.
The US military command in South Korea said there was no change so far in
plans to take the 55,000 US troops mobilised for Team Spirit from the
country.
The exercise tests US ability to reinforce its 38,000 troops in South Korea
in the case of war.
North Korea has routinely condemned such exercises as a threat to its
security and by putting troops on increased alert. Pyongyang has also used
the exercises as a pretext to break off previous negotiations with Seoul
about nuclear inspections.
The Team Spirit exercise this year coincided with the International Atomic
Energy Agency's demand that North Korea let it inspect two suspected nuclear
facilities by March 25 or face possible economic sanctions by the UN
Security Council.
The decision to place North Korea on a 'semi-war' footing on March 9, the
day Team Spirit began, was made by Mr Kim Jong-il, son of President Kim
Il-sung and his designated successor, according to Naewoe, the South Korean
agency that monitors North Korean news.
Mr Li Chol, North Korean ambassador at the UN in Geneva, said his country
might reverse its decision on withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty if the US permanently suspended Team Spirit, according to Japan's
Kyodo News Service.
He also said the IAEA should 'stop obeying the only superpower', meaning the
US, and that it should operate in an impartial manner.
He suggested that the IAEA had made its demand for a special inspection of
the North Korean nuclear facilities on US orders.
