FT  29 JUL 94 / June unit trust sales rise 50% to Pounds 1.1bn
Unit trusts had their best June on record, with net sales of Pounds 1.1bn -
50 per cent up on Pounds 726m in May. The June figure was almost 80 per cent
higher than that for June last year, when net sales totalled Pounds 610m.
Less than half the net sales last month were to the retail sector - the
lowest proportion so far this year - with the rest bought by institutions,
the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds said.
The best-selling sectors among retail investors were UK growth, followed by
UK equity income and international growth. Institutional sales were
dominated by UK general, followed by UK equity income and UK smaller
companies. Both types of investors were net sellers of European funds.
Quarterly sales figures of unit-trust personal equity plans, which shield
investments from income and capital-gains tax, were released yesterday for
the first time by the association.
Net Pep sales were Pounds 1.11bn for the second quarter - a decline, but not
as much as might be expected - from Pounds 1.55bn for the first quarter,
which is the traditionally busy end-of-tax-year sales period.
