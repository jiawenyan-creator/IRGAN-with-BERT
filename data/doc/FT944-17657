FT  07 OCT 94 / Republicans kill bill on lobbying
Republican senators yesterday succeeded in killing a bill to limit the gifts
they could receive from lobbyists, adding one more scalp to their collection
of legislation blocked or defeated in the closing days of the congressional
session, George Graham writes from Washington.
Democratic leaders failed to achieve the two-thirds majority they needed to
break a Republican filibuster against the bill, which would have stiffened
the registration requirements for people who spend money or are paid to
lobby Congress or the administration.
The bill, which passed the House last week, would have barred most gifts
from lobbyists to members of Congress - except for campaign contributions -
and would have allowed members to accept meals only up to a value of Dollars
20 (Pounds 12.60).
The lobbying reform bill had provoked the anger of many members who felt it
demeaned them by suggesting they could be bought so cheaply, and had
particularly irritated golfers, because it would prevent them from accepting
expense-paid trips to the many charity golf tournaments mounted every year
in choice resorts by businesses and trade associations.
But this is not the kind of argument that members are eager to make less
than five weeks ahead of an election, and last-minute opposition to the bill
in the House last week and then this week in the Senate has focused on
claims that the measure would infringe the right of religious groups to
lobby Congress.
Congressman Newt Gingrich, the Republican minority whip in the House and the
leader of the campaign to kill the bill, called it 'a gag rule on the
grassroots'.
Since the bill mostly exempts church groups from registering their
communications with members as a lobbying activity, this explanation appears
less credible than the Republicans' fierce determination to deny the
Democrats' even the smallest legislative victory ahead of the November 8
mid-term election.
President Bill Clinton had said both lobbying and campaign finance reform
were high priorities for him, but both have now been defeated.
