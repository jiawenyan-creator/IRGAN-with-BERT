  [Abstract] Development of algorithms of a control system 
for walking machines was examined from positions of optimization 
of periodic controllable systems with variable relations. During 
this, consideration of dynamic processes caused by a change of 
the imposed connections greatly improved the quality of 
algorithms of control and, especially, decreased loadings on 
control mechanisms. Mathematical modelling of the movement of a 
machine with biomechanical mesurements of parameters of human 
walking were presented and discussed. Conclusions of other 
authors concerning this question were discussed. References 47:
