FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Proudfoot halved at Pounds 12m after
provisions
ALEXANDER Proudfoot, the US-based but UK-quoted management consultant, made
a Pounds 6m provision against liabilities, interest and penalties on unpaid
overseas taxes in its interim results.
The group, which suffered a sharp decline in its share price over the last
few months following uncertainty over its trading outlook, declared pre-tax
profits halved to Pounds 12m in the six months to June 30.
Turnover was up 7 per cent to Pounds 95m (Pounds 88.5m). Excluding the
acquisition of Indevo Consulting of Sweden in September last year turnover
fell 3 per cent.
Basic earnings per share were 11.25p (24.24p) or 10.94p (22.7p) fully
diluted. The interim dividend is held at 6p and the company said the final
dividend would also be maintained at 6p.
Directors disclosed that there had been reorganisation costs during the
period of Pounds 1.3m principally related to the Crosby and Indevo
businesses, and Pounds 1.5m on product development.
Mr Neil Hamilton, finance director, said that an internal review recently
discovered that the company may not have paid sufficient taxes on middle
managers employees in one country in which it operates over about five
years. The board made a provision to cover all additional charges which may
be incurred.
