FT  11 SEP 93 / Gas-fired power stations approved
MR TIM Eggar, energy minister, yesterday approved two gas-fired power
stations - a 1,200MW combined cycle gas turbine plant at Seabank, Avon, and
a similar 710MW station at Keadby on Humberside.
The stations are the latest in the controversial 'dash for gas' which has
been blamed for the contraction of the coal industry.
