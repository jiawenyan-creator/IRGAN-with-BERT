FT  04 MAY 91 / Disney's Dow debut no cartoon fantasy
IN A MOVE symbolic of the changing shape of the US economy, Walt Disney
Company is to replace USX, the giant steel manufacturer, in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.
The decision ends a 63-year relationship between USX and the nation's most
widely watched stock market average, whose 30 companies represent a
cross-section of US business.
The steel producer, then known as US Steel, was one of the 30 original
constituents of the Dow when it was first published in the Wall Street
Journal on October 1, 1928. The inclusion of Disney at its expense
exemplifies the changes since that time in the US business landscape.
Where once the average really did represent the 'industrials', it now finds
room for McDonald's, Coca-Cola and American Express.
Disney is not joining the average alone. In the biggest shake-up of the Dow
since 1959, J P Morgan, the blue-chip Wall Street banking group, and
Caterpillar, the world's biggest maker of earth-moving equipment, are also
to be listed. They will replace Primerica, once a canning company but now a
financial conglomerate, and Navistar, a truck maker.
Dow Jones, the company which calculates and publishes the average, said the
changes were intended to reflect the US economy in the 1990s, with the
growth of the entertainment and services sectors.
Since 1928 more than two dozen stocks have been replaced, and only seven
survive in their initial form: Bethlehem Steel, General Electric, General
Motors, Sears Roebuck, Union Carbide, Westinghouse Electric and Woolworth.
