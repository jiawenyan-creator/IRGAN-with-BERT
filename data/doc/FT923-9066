FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Profits rise 17% at Cheung Kong
CHEUNG Kong, Mr Li Ka-shing's flagship Hong Kong company, yesterday reported
a 17 per cent rise in net profits to HKDollars 2.23bn (USDollars 288.5m) for
the six months to June 30 from HKDollars 1.98bn in the first half of 1992.
Cheung Kong, in which Mr Li has a 34.9 per cent holding, is one of Hong
Kong's leading property developers and investment companies.
It is the vehicle through which Mr Li holds a 40 per cent interest in
Hutchison Whampoa, and a diversified portfolio of small investments in other
listed companies.
Cheung Kong's profit growth was struck on a 38.8 per cent jump in turnover
to HKDollars 4.7bn from HKDollars 3.4bn. Earnings per share rose to
HKDollars 1.06 from HKDollars 0.90.
An interim dividend of 20 cents a share was declared, up 18 per cent from
the 17 cents last time.
Mr Li expects the full year results to show satisfactory growth and
dividends for the year would be raised.
The Hong Kong property market was showing some signs of slowing down.
'However, in view of the still robust economy and the restricted supply of
land, the market will continue to be active, after a short period of
consolidation.'
During the first half, Cheung Kong invested HKDollars 1.6bn in
locally-listed companies. It has a large cash surplus - estimated to rise to
about HKDollars 9bn by the end of this year. For cash management reasons it
has decided to put part of that surplus into local shares where returns are
higher than in the local money market.
