Sevastopol...."] 
  [Text] Ye. Saburov, who was offered the post of Crimean 
vice premier, told our correspondent that the political 
situation on the peninsula interested him from one point of view 
only: Whether it will make it possible to develop a free 
economy in the Crimea. He said that on 4 and 5 March, he would 
go to Moscow to hold meetings with Russian and foreign 
structures, whose representatives he would like to invite to the 
Crimea. Then he will fly to London for the same purpose. He 
plans to return to the Crimea in three or four weeks and get 
down to work, provided that the parliament approves his status 
as vice premier. He does not intend to adopt Ukrainian 
citizenship. However, Chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council 
N. Bagrov said that he would not allow Saburov to occupy such a 
high post. 
  Meanwhile, a strike committee represented by the bloc of 
pro-Russian forces and trade union leaders was created in 
Sevastopol. The strike committee submitted a package of draft 
resolutions for the forthcoming city council session. The 
package includes a draft resolution on transferring Sevastopol 
to Russian jurisdiction.
