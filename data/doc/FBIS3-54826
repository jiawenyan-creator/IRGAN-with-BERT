  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 03, BNS -- The Estonian parliament's 
Pro Patria faction met Monday to discuss the upcoming changes in 
the government. The party is expected to put its proposals to 
its coalition partners tomorrow. 
  The meeting was attended by Estonian Prime Minister Mart 
Laar. The government's press service declined to comment on the 
outcome of the discussion to BNS. Members of Parliament (MPs) 
Jaanus Betlem and Toivo Jurgenson, members of Pro Patria, also 
refused to comment. 
  According to information in the Estonian press, four 
ministers are expected to be replaced. Defense Minister Juri 
Luik will replace Foreign Minister Trivimi Velliste. 
  The defense portfolio will pass to MP Indrek Kannik. Finance 
Minister Madis Uurike will be replaced by Heiki Kranich, a 
member of the parliament's Liberal faction, and Toivo Jurgenson, 
a Pro Patria parliamentary faction member, is expected to 
replace Economics Minister Toomas Sildmae. 
  Under the coalition agreement, all the four portfolios 
belong 
to Pro Patria. The new appointments, however, will have to be 
approved by the coalition council that is expected to meet 
Tuesday. 
  The Cabinet reshuffle will probably take place before the 
parliament reconvenes Jan. 10, so the new ministers can be sworn 
in immediately.
