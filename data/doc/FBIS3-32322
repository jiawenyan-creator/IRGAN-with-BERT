  [Text] The political movement FRAPH, Revolutionary Front 
for the Haitian Advancement and Progress, will be in the streets 
of Port-au-Prince on 4 February. The leaders of the party are 
calling for a demonstration demanding the lifting of the embargo. 
  [Begin Emmanuel Constant recording, in Creole] We in FRAPH 
are calling for a demonstration to ask the international 
community to lift the embargo that is causing the Haitian people 
to groan. Not many Haitians know how Aristide lives abroad. He 
lives like a human being while we in FRAPH, who are living here, 
we know the sufferings that the Haitian people are facing: Food 
is expensive, there is no gasoline, the business sector has 
stopped, there is no transportation, the hospitals are closed. 
In a word, national life is blocked. Who is the cause of that? 
We say aloud: It is Aristide, who is living the good life with 
no thought of the sufferings of the Haitians who voted for him. 
Today, we are standing up and are asking for lifting the 
embargo because Aristide does not have a feather [as heard] in 
Haiti; he does not have a child. We in FRAPH are asking 
everyone: Who is not affected by the embargo? Therefore, 
everyone, come to Colon Square on 4 February at 1000 so that we 
can say that we are tired of the embargo; please lift it for us. 
[end recording]. This initiative is supported by PDCH [Haitian 
Christian Democratic Party], MDN [Mobilization for National 
Development] and PARADI [Haitian Party Of God] as well as by the 
Capois La Mort organization. 
  On the other hand, a people's organization of the Bel-Air 
district is against this demonstration.
