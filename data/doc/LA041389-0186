SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SOUTH PASADENA; 
STUDENT WINS STUDY GRANT 
Pehr Luedtke is one of 66 high school students from across the country selected 
by the National Endowment for the Humanities as a 1989 Younger Scholar. 
He will receive a $1,800 grant this summer for independent study on the George 
Donner party, an ill-fated group of 87 pioneers which was stranded without food 
in the Sierra Nevada in the winter of 1946-47. Some members of the group 
resorted to cannibalism. Luedtke said he plans to read diaries left by party 
members and interview experts on the West. 
Luedtke, of South Pasadena, attends Polytechnic School in Pasadena.
