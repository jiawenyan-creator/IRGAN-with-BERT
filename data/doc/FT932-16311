FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Japanese groups join Motorola
venture
A GROUP of 20 Japanese companies have agreed to work with Motorola of the US
to build a Dollars 3.37bn global satellite communications system.
The companies include Sony, Mitsubishi, Kyocera and DDI, a long-distance
telecommunications carrier in which Sony and Kyocera have a stake.
The system, to be called Iridium, is designed to support a cellular
telephone network capable of being accessed from anywhere in the world. It
would offer voice, data, facsimile and positional services.
Motorola has been attempting for more than two years to assemble an
international consortium to own and operate the Iridium network.
The government of Brazil and United Communications of Thailand are reported
to have signed letters of intent to take a stake in the consortium.
There are regulatory hurdles still to be cleared, however, and Motorola is
in competition with five other US-based proposed systems, including
Constellation Communications, Ellipsat, Loral Qualcomm and American Mobile
Satellite.
