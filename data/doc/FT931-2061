FT  22 MAR 93 / International Company News: Austria Tabak poised to buy Head
sports group
AUSTRIA Tabakwerke, the state-owned tobacco monopoly, is understood to have
agreed in principle to buy the Head sports equipment group for about Dollars
200m.
The monopoly, like other tobacco companies, has been seeking to diversify
away from its dependence on tobacco, partly because of health concerns.
Tabakwerke will also have to give up its monopoly position as a result of
Austria joining the European Economic Area (EEA), the enlarged free-trade
area being created this year by the countries of the European Community and
most of those in the European Free Trade Association.
Head is a leading international sports equipment group that specialises in
making skis, ski boots and bindings, tennis rackets and shoes and diving
equipment. Annual sales are about Dollars 400m.
The group was the subject of a leveraged buyout in early 1989, which was
arranged by the Los Angeles merchant banking group Freeman Spogli and
financed largely by Sumitomo Bank of Japan and Creditanstalt of Austria.
The shareholder group was led by Lowe Finance of Geneva.
The terms of that deal provided for roughly Dollars 285m of debt to be
supported by only Dollars 50m in equity.
It is understood that while Head has performed well, the leverage in the
capital structure has proven too great.
The desire of Sumitomo Bank to reduce its international lending exposure
also contributed to the decision by the shareholders to sell.
Austria Tabakwerke said it could not confirm that it was purchasing Head.
'We are in the midst of discussions with various parties and nothing has
been settled yet,' a spokesman said.
