FT  12 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Price-setting deal under attack
European exporters' organisations have threatened legal action against the
European Commission if it does not move quickly against a shipowners'
agreement to set prices across the north Atlantic. The British and French
Shippers' Councils have written to the commission's competition directorate
 -DG4 - demanding measures to outlaw the Trans-Atlantic Agreement (TAA). The
shippers are worried that unless action is taken soon, the TAA will go into
its third year and exporters will face price rises of 15 per cent on cargoes
crossing the north Atlantic.
The TAA is a 'conference' or agreement between 15 large shipping lines
accounting for about 85 per cent of sailings between northern Europe and the
US, to regulate both rates and capacity. It was introduced to stem losses by
shipping lines, and its members include many large container shipping lines
such as P&amp;A, Nedlloyd and Maersk.
The European Commission has issued a temporary judgment objecting to the
TAA, but shippers are now pressing for a final ruling. They also want a
decision to outlaw a compromise agreement, the Trans-Atlantic Conference
Agreement, proposed by the shipowners in July.
