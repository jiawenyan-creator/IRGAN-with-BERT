FT  13 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: HK tightens lending rules for
new issue applicants
THE Hong Kong government is to tighten rules on bank lending to applicants
for stock market new issues following concern over the HKDollars 240bn
(USDollars 31.2bn) over-subscription of Denway, the Chinese car manufacturer
floated on the colony's exchange in February.
The group's shares were 657 times subscribed, absorbing four times the
amount of money in circulation in Hong Kong. There are nine Chinese state
companies due to be floated in the colony this year, and public interest is
expected to be similarly voracious.
Under current arrangements clients can get 100 per cent funding for
subscription, encouraging them to apply for far more shares than they would
expect to be allocated. This cash is then immobilised for one week before
excess application money is returned.
The latest guidelines limit a bank's new issue subscription loans to 25 per
cent of its capital base, and recommend a margin requirement of 10 per cent
against the loans.
It is expected that brokerages will pass on this margin call to clients,
thereby cooling some of their speculative fervour.
