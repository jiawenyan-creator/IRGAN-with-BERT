SKUNK WORKS CREATOR DIES AT 80 
Clarence L. (Kelly) Johnson, creator of Lockheed Corp.'s secret Skunk Works 
aircraft factory and a leading designer of the U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird spy 
planes, died today. He was 80. 
Johnson died at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank after an illness of many 
years, a Lockheed statement said. The illness was not disclosed. 
Johnson organized the Skunk Works in 1943 to build the XP-80 Shooting Star, the 
United States' first production jet fighter. 
Many aircraft and spacecraft bore his mark: the P-38 Lightning in World War II, 
the Constellation transports, the Hercules cargo planes, the P2V antisubmarine 
patrol aircraft and the Agena spacecraft, among others. 
Johnson, born in Ishpeming, Mich., on Feb. 27, 1910, went to work for Lockheed 
as a tool designer in 1933. He went on to head the Skunk Works for 30 years.
