BISCUITS KILL 9 CHILDREN 
At least nine children died and 10 more were hospitalized after eating 
biscuits, the newspaper Kompas said Friday. 
Ahmad Azof, head of the South Sumatra Health Office, told the newspaper the 
poisoning was caused by too much sodium nitrate, a preservative. Police 
arrested two distributors of the biscuits, the newspaper said.
