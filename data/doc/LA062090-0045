SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
A group of current and former UC San Diego employees filed suit Tuesday against 
the university, alleging that they were demoted or fired from their jobs on 
racial grounds. 
The suit, filed in San Diego Superior Court, claims that the workers' civil 
rights were violated and that they were discriminated against because they are 
black, Latino and Filipino. 
It also alleges that the university misled the workers into thinking they would 
be eligible for pay raises and promotions. 
The suit, which lawyers say has the potential to become a class-action claim on 
behalf of "numerous" workers, was filed on behalf of nine employees at 
university administrative facilities, classrooms and hospitals. 
The nine held jobs such as X-ray file clerk, painter and custodian, according 
to the suit. 
The amount of damages sought was not disclosed.
