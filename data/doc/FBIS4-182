  [Text] The head of state, General Sani Abacha, returned to 
Abuja last night after a foreign tour that took him to India and 
Saudi Arabia. In India, he attended the G-15 summit, and in 
Saudi Arabia he visited Medina and performed a one-day 
pilgrimage to Mecca. He was accompanied to Mecca by the 
minister of external affairs, Alhaji Babagana Kingibe, the 
Nigerian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Professor (Shehu 
Karaganchi) and the counselor (Jalloh Njeba Alhaji Kafakagbon). 
  In Jedda, the Saudi authorities pledged to improve on the 
facilities and welfare services for Nigerians on pilgrimage. 
The pledge was made by the Saudi minister for pilgrim and hajj 
operations, Dr. Mahmud al-Safar, during an exchange of views 
with Alhaji Babagana Kingibe. He said that a recommendation 
from the Nigerian Government on ways of improving hajj 
facilities would be most welcome. Responding, the minister of 
external affairs said a master plan from his ministry on the 
conduct of pilgrim/hajj operations would soon be forwarded to 
the Saudi Government. Making a statement to the press at Jedda, 
Gen. Abacha described the G-15 summit as important to Nigeria's 
search for indigenous technology and trade relations under the 
South-South cooperation. 
  The head of state reaffirmed the Federal Government's 
commitment to the objectives of the Group and said Nigeria would 
continue to use the experiences gained from such organizations 
for her political, economic, and social development. Gen. 
Abacha was welcomed back at Abuja airport by the chief of 
general staff, Lieutenant General Oladipo Diya, the minister of 
the capital territory, Lt. Gen. Jeremiah Useni and other top 
government officials.
