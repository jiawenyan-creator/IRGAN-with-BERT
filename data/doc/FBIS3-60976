  [Text] Brussels, Jan 3 (AFP) -- The body of a Bosnian 
general shot dead was found in a car park along the main highway 
between Liege in eastern Belgium and the German border town of 
Aachen, legal sources disclosed here Monday [3 January]. 
  They said two Romanian hitchhikers found the corpse of Yusuf 
Prazina at Walhorn overnight Friday. Prazina, 30, who had been 
in the fighting in Sarajevo, settled in Liege last August. He 
was missing early last month, the sources said. 
  Belgian public service radio said Prazina, regarded as a 
moderate, had deserted and taken refuge in Belgium. He often 
went about armed and accompanied by bodyguards who were his 
former soldiers. 
  The radio said he disappeared with three of them on December 
3. It said the bullets to his head matched the calibre of the 
weapon of one of the bodyguards and that the general was killed 
some three weeks ago.
