NEW MEXICO STATE CAGE PLAYERS HURT IN FRESNO CRASH 
Several members of the New Mexico State basketball team suffered minor injuries 
after their van was struck and rolled over once at a foggy intersection near 
the Fresno airport, Fresno police said. 
Visibility was reported to be near zero about 7:25 a.m. today when a van driven 
by Kenneth Smith of New Mexico reportedly ran a red light and was broadsided by 
a car driven by Rachel Avila of Fresno, police reported. The coach, five 
players and the team's sports information director were in the van and were to 
be released from Fresno Community Hospital before noon today, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
Avila and her two passengers were reported in fair condition at Valley Medical 
Center. 
A Fresno Community Hospital spokeswoman said three players were hurt: Jeff 
McCool with a neck injury; Willie Joseph with a back injury and Steve McGlothin 
with a knee injury. Sports information director Steve Shutt suffered bruises. 
Police said the accident occurred while the team's van was heading eastbound on 
McKinley Avenue toward the Fresno airport. The van apparently ran a red light 
at the intersection of Cedar Avenue, was struck and rolled once, coming to rest 
on the roof, police said. 
New Mexico defeated the Fresno State Bulldogs 53-50 Monday night in Selland 
Arena.
