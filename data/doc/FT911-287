FT  13 MAY 91 / International Economic Indicators: How to compare relative
economic wealth - National accounts
THE MOST CONVENIENT way to compare the economic size and wealth of countries
is to convert figures for gross national product into a common currency
using market exchange rates. But the results can be misleading.
The dangers are illustrated in this week's table, in which data on the gross
national product or gross domestic product of each country have been
converted into a common currency, the European currency unit (Ecu).
Some surprising things emerge. For example, Japanese GNP apparently
contracted last year, to Ecu2,332.4bn from Ecu2,625.2bn in 1989, so reducing
Japan's share in the total output of the six largest industrialised
countries to 22.5 per cent in 1990, from 24.2 per cent in 1989. Yet Japan's
economic growth rate was the highest of the six countries, as the lower half
of the table shows.
This apparent contradiction is explained by the yen's 21 per cent
depreciation against the Ecu between 1989 and 1990. Large fluctuations in
exchange rates can give a misleading picture of changes in economic
fortunes.
What matters in comparing economic size is the relative purchasing power
these figures represent: the quantity of goods that nominal GNP will buy in
each country.
The OECD has calculated the levels of income needed in each national
currency to purchase an identical basket of goods and services at prevailing
domestic prices. In 1990 a specific basket of goods costing dollars 100 to
buy in the US would have cost Y19,800 in Japan and pounds 63.40 in the UK.
Converting each country's GNP into dollars using these purchasing power
parity (PPP) exchange rates provides a better guide to economic size, one
that adjusts for fluctuations in exchange rates. The Japanese share in total
PPP-adjusted GNP did rise from 18.6 per cent in 1989 to 19.3 per cent in
1990, as one would expect.
The adjustment for PPP produces a very different picture of relative
economic size in 1990. Both the US and the UK have a higher share of the six
countries' total output on the basis of the PPP measure than on the basis of
current exchange rates, and vice versa for the other four.
The graph shows levels of average GNP per head in 1990, converted into
dollars. At current exchange rates (on the vertical axis) Germany had the
highest income per head, followed by Japan and the US. Using PPP exchange
rates, however, (on the horizontal axis) this order is reversed.
At current exchange rates the relative size and income per head of the
German and Japanese economies is over-stated, relative to their purchasing
power equivalent - they both lie to the left of the 45 degree line.
This means that prices overall are higher in Japan than in the US at current
exchange rates. Why then do US companies not sell more goods in Japan, until
the price differences disappear? Perhaps transport costs, tariffs, or
restrictive practices prevent US companies from doing so or, alternatively,
Japanese consumers prefer Japanese goods.
A better explanation is that prices are higher for non-tradable goods
(services such as domestic banking and insurance, taxis and hair cuts) in
the continental European economies and Japan than in the US and UK, because
these economies are relatively more efficient at producing tradable (largely
manufactured) goods, and relatively less efficient at producing non-tradable
goods. Thus, these four countries have higher real exchange rates (defined
as the relative price of non-tradable goods in terms of tradable goods).
The prices of tradable goods are brought into rough equality by global
competition (ignoring the impact of trade barriers). Consequently these
countries will have relatively high domestic prices for non-tradable goods
at market exchange rates. This will boost the value of their output at
current exchange rates.
If developing countries were to be included in the chart they would all lie
below the 45 degree line. This is because they are relatively less
productive than developed countries at producing tradable goods than they
are at producing non-tradable goods. Thus dollars 1 buys far more services
in, say, Indonesia than in the US at current exchange rates.

Payments (April 15), Money and Finance (April 22), Production and Employment
(April 29) and Prices and Competitiveness (May 7). Back issues can be

Seasonally adjusted data used in all cases. Statistics for Germany apply
only to western Germany. GNP/GDP is broken down into private consumption
expenditure, investment (the sum of gross fixed capital formation and the
change in stocks), general government final consumption, and net exports
(exports of goods and services minus imports of goods and services). The US
includes investment by government in the government series rather than under
investment.  Quarterly GNP/GDP totals are annualised. The growth rates are
the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year,
and are positive unless otherwise stated. The figures in the fifth column of
each set of growth rates refer to import volumes. Data supplied by
Datastream and WEFA from national government sources.
