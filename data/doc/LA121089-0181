SURGE LIFTS DAMEWORTH TO NATIONAL TITLE; 
CROSS-COUNTRY: AGOURA HIGH SENIOR CONCLUDES AN UNBEATEN SEASON BY PULLING AWAY 
TO A 50-METER VICTORY IN THE KINNEY CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
Judgment Day arrived Saturday for Bryan Dameworth, the whiz kid whose 
undefeated season was put to a test in the Kinney national cross-country 
championships at Balboa Park. 
Andrew Maris, a senior from White River High in Buckley, Wash., stayed with the 
Agoura High senior for the first 2 3/4 miles but could not keep pace thereafter 
as Dameworth won in 14 minutes, 49.9 seconds over the 5,000-meter course. Maris 
was second in 15:00.9. 
Maris tailed Dameworth and Teddy Mitchell of Lyman High in Longwood, Fla., at 
one mile and Dameworth and Maris were tied for first at two miles (9:39). But 
Dameworth took control in the last quarter-mile with a closing surge to win by 
50 meters. 
"We were just going to see who would run out of fuel first," said Dameworth, 
the fifth California runner in the meet's 11-year history to win the national 
championship and first since Marc Davis (San Diego High) in 1986. "I was 
concentrating on hanging in there as long as I could. 
"I was scared. He's really tough." 
Dameworth, who had finished fourth in the 1988 national final, became the 
second Valley-area runner to win the title. Eric Reynolds won the 1982 
championship in Orlando, Fla., as a Camarillo High senior. 
Hoover senior Eliazar Herrera ran a strong final mile to finish 11th (15:25.2) 
after completing two miles (10:01) in 23rd. 
"I just thought that it was my last race and I wanted to place as high as 
possible," Herrera said. 
"I ran what I could the last mile, all out." 
Arroyo Grande junior Louie Quintana, who shadowed Dameworth with second-place 
finishes in the Southern Section 2-A Division, state Division I and West 
regional championships, placed third in 15:10.0. 
In the girls' competition, Agoura junior Deena Drossin faded from fourth at the 
mile mark (5:25) and finished 13th in 18:14.3. 
The season-closing meet was a disappointment for Drossin, who had hoped for a 
top-five finish after 11th- and 17th-place efforts the past two years. 
"I just didn't have it, I guess," Drossin said. 
Westlake's Jeannie Rothman, eighth in the West regional, finished 16th in 
18:32.7.
