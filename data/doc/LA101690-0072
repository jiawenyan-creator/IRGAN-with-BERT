BRIEFLY 
Justice Department Backtracks: The department urged adoption of sentencing 
guidelines for corporations convicted of crimes that would force judges to 
impose fines based on the seriousness of the offense. But the department shied 
away from a proposal it had earlier advanced under which a company involved in 
a massive fraud could be fined twice its gain or twice the loss to its victims. 
The department rescinded its support for one of the proposals under 
consideration, as well as its own suggestion, after receiving an inquiry from 
the White House, which had been contacted by some business groups expressing 
concern over stiff fines.
