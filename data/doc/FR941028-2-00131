 

III. Findings and Conclusions



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission finds that the CBOE's proposal serves to facilitate transactions in securities, and
to protect investors and the public interest.

The CBOE's proposal is designed to benefit non-broker-dealer customers by increasing the size of orders for which
they can be assured executions to a minimum depth of 100 contracts for interest rate options. Although the Commission
carefully scrutinizes discriminatory order execution practices, limiting the 100 contract minimum to non-broker-dealer
customers is consistent with the purposes of the Act. The intent of the 100 contract minimum is to allow DPMs in interest
rate options to become more competitive in making markets, thereby contributing to a more free and open market and
facilitating customer orders. 

The Commission believes that the larger markets created by increasing the minimum firm-quote contract size could
result in tighter spreads. This in turn should contribute to a more liquid options market, to the benefit of all market
participants. Furthermore, increasing the minimum DPM quote sizes available to customer orders furthers the underlying
purposes of the CBOE's firm quote rule.

By limiting the applicability of the 100 minimum contract size to classes of interest rate options for which PAR workstations
are available, the CBOE's proposal addresses the need of DPMs to have flexibility in adjusting their quotes beyond
that which is provided by the Exchange's Autoquote System alone.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 The ``fast market'' exception of Rule 6.6 also addresses such concerns by providing DPMs relief during fast moving
markets.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 Although the CBOE Rules will continue to allow the MPC to grant exemptions from the 100 contract firm quote requirement
on a case by case basis,
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 the Commission believes such exemptions should only be granted in extraordinary circumstances.

The presence of the PAR Workstation enhances the benefits already provided by the Exchange's Autoquote System. Autoquote
changes DPMs' published quotes automatically in response to changed market conditions; the PAR workstations allow
DPMs greater quote flexibility than that provided by the CBOE's Autoquote System by itself.

The Commission believes that the CBOE rules will ensure that those DPMs required to meet the 100 contract firm quote
guarantee for interest rate options will be adequately capitalized to handle the increased guarantee. In this regard,
CBOE Rules will continue to require that member organizations subject to Rule 15c31 under the Act comply with
the capital requirements prescribed therein, as well as comply with certain additional requirements of the CBOE.

The Commission also notes that the CBOE's proposal will be introduced gradually, and initially will only apply to
30-year bond interest rate options. As the use of PAR workstations extends to other classes of interest rate options,
so too will the applicability of the 100 contract firm quote minimum.

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. The Commission believes that Amendment No. 2 serves to clarify the operation of the Exchange's systems as they relate
to a DPM's firm quote responsibilities. Specifically, Amendment No. 2 describes how PAR workstations, together
with the CBOE's existing Autoquote System, allow DPMs to adjust quotes with speed and flexibility. In clarifying
the operation of the Exchange's systems, Amendment No. 2 does not create any substantive changes to the CBOE's proposal.
Based on the foregoing, the Commission believes that it is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment
No. 2 to the CBOE's proposal on an accelerated basis.

Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendment No. 2 to the proposed
rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments,
all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written
communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that
may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection
and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing
will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Exchange. All submissions should
refer to File No. SRCBOE9417 and should be submitted by November 21, 1994.



It Is Therefore Ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SRCBOE9417), as amended, is approved.
