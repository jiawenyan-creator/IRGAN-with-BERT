TEACHERS LEAVE CLASSROOMS FOR PICKET LINES 
The LAUSD teachers' strike will fill the news in the next few weeks. As the 
husband of a 19-year LAUSD veteran, I know the risk, sacrifice, dedication and 
commitment it takes to be a teacher today. 
Unfortunately, what is thought to be newsworthy may miss the point entirely. 
This strike is not really about more money or additional benefits. Reduced to 
its lowest common denominator it is simply about raising the level of teaching 
to the "professional" status that it deserves so we can attract and hold the 
very best to teach our children. 
Think about an America not taught by professionals. Genius may be born, but it 
still has to be taught.
