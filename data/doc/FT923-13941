FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Greek telecoms group soars 77%
INTRACOM, the Greek telecommunications company in which Ericsson of Sweden
holds a 15 per cent stake, has reported a 77 per cent rise in net profits to
Dr6.3bn (Dollars 34m) for 1991.
Sales rose by 85 per cent to Dr30.4bn last year from Dr16.1bn in 1990
following the award of new contracts from OTE, the Greek telecoms monopoly,
and DEH, the country's electricity utility.
Intracom, a large equipment supplier for OTE, is starting to diversify
before liberalisation of telecommunications in Greece later this year.
It already exports specialised software for Ericsson digital switching
systems and power supplies for IBM personal computers. Exports in 1991
amounted to 7 per cent of sales and are expected to rise strongly this year,
following sales in Russia and Romania of a computerised state lottery system
designed by Intracom.
The company said investment this year would amount to Dr6.5bn under a
five-year plan launched in 1990 that calls for total investment of Dr25bn in
new telecoms products and information systems.
