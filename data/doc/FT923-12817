FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: CSX takes Dollars 450m charge
CSX, the US transportation group, plans to take a Dollars 450m after-tax
charge when it reports second-quarter results, writes Nikki Tait. The charge
is primarily to cover the buying-out of certain compensation arrangements
paid to train crews at the company's rail unit, CSX Transportation.
CSX had already taken a hefty Dollars 755m charge to earnings in 1991, to
cover severance payments for employees leaving CSXT as train crews are
reduced from three to two people. However, this assumed no buy-out of the
short crew allowance, and only a partial buy-out of productivity funds. CSX
shares rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 63 1/2.
