The information collection requirements contained in this final rule have been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. No person may be subjected to a penalty for failure
to comply with these information collection requirements until they have been approved and assigned an OMB control

II. Publication of the Proposed Rule


On September 16, 1993, the Department published in the above Docket, at 58 FR 48556, a proposed rule entitled ``Appraisals
and Property Valuation''. The proposal, among other things, would promulgate a new part 267 to title 24 of the Code
of Federal Regulations containing minimum standards for HUD real estate appraisals and criteria for the selection
of appraisers by mortgagees. The preamble to the proposed rule describes, in greater detail than below, the legislative
background for this rulemaking and set the rulemaking in the context of certain administrative changes that the Department
had been considering on its own initiative. The preamble also explains the significant provisions of proposed part
267 as well as certain conforming amendments to other parts of HUD regulations.
