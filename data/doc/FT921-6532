FT  27 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Helaba registers sharp
increase in earnings
HESSISCHE Landesbank Girozentrale (Helaba), the large German financial
institution based in the state of Hesse, yesterday reported sharply
increased earnings for 1991.
Reflecting generally buoyant conditions for Germany's banking sector last
year, the bank increased its partial operating profits by 58 per cent to
DM256m (Dollars 160m).
The bank said the main reason for the increase was a surge in interest
income, which climbed by DM86.9m to DM613.5m, combined with an increase in
margins to 0.82 per cent. Including a modest 4 per cent increase in
own-account trading profits, the bank's total operating profits rose by 43.6
per cent to DM316.4m.
The bank said the good result would allow it to pay an unchanged dividend
for 1991, to make generous increases to hidden and open reserves of the
bank, and to bolster risk provisions, particularly in respect of loans to
problem countries.
