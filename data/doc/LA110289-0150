METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COSTUMED YOUTHS TRICK STORE, STEAL TREATS 
About 25 youths dressed in costumes took nearly $600 in small electronic 
equipment from a Silver Lake electronic store Tuesday night, but the store 
manager was unable to describe any of the youths to police because of the 
disguises. 
The manager of the Radio Shack store at 3733 Sunset Blvd. told police that the 
youths came in at 6 p.m. and shouted, "Trick or treat," then dispersed 
throughout the store and grabbed $580 worth of equipment, including cassettes 
and cordless phones. The shoplifters ran out of the store, investigators said.
