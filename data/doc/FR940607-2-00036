Ambient Air Monitoring Reference and Equivalent Methods; Equivalent Method Designation



Notice is hereby given that EPA, in accordance with 40 CFR part 53, has designated another equivalent method for the
determination of lead in suspended particulate matter collected from ambient air. The new designated method is identified
as follows:




EQL0694096, ``Determination of Lead Concentration in Ambient Particulate Matter by Inductively
Coupled Argon Plasma Optical Emission spectrometry (State of West Virginia).''




The applicant's request for an equivalent method determination for the above method was received on March 28, 1994.

This method has been tested by the applicant, the State of West Virginia, in accordance with the test procedures prescribed
in 40 CFR part 53. After reviewing the results of these tests, EPA has determined, in accordance with part 53, that this
method should be designated as an equivalent method. The information submitted by the applicant will be kept on file
at EPA's Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, and
will be available for inspection to the extent consistent with 40 CFR part 2 (EPA's regulations implementing the Freedom
of Information Act).

This method uses the sampling procedure specified in the reference method for the determination of lead in suspended
particulate matter collected from ambient air (43 FR 46258). Lead in the particulate matter is solubilized by extraction
with a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, facilitated by heat and ultrasonication. The lead content of
the sample is analyzed by a Thermo Jarrel Ash AtomScan 16 inductively coupled argon plasma optical emission spectrometer
using the 220.3 nm lead emission line and instrument conditions optimized by the user laboratory. Technical questions
concerning the method should be directed to the State of West Virginia, Department of Commerce, Labor and Environmental
Resources, Division of Environmental Protection, Office of Air Quality, 1558 Washington Street East, Charleston,
West Virginia 253112599.

As a designated equivalent method, this method is acceptable for use by states and other control agencies under requirements
of 40 CFR part 58, Ambient Air Quality Surveillance. For such purposes the method must be used in strict accordance
with the procedures and specifications provided in the method description. States or other agencies using inductively
coupled argon plasma optical emission spectrometric methods that employ procedures and specifications significantly
different from those in this method must seek approval for their particular method under the provisions of 2.8
of Appendix C to 40 CFR Part 58 (Modification of Methods by Users) or may seek designation of such methods as equivalent
methods under the provisions of 40 CFR part 53.

Additional information concerning this action may be obtained from Frank F. McElroy, Methods Research and Development
Division (MD77), Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, telephone (919) 5412622.
