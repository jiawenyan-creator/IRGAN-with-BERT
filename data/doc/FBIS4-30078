  [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii said Thursday [23 June] his ministry will continue 
tightening its belt in forming the budget for the next fiscal 
year. 
  "It's too early to decide" on the next budget, but "we must 
continue promoting fiscal reforms," Fujii told a press meeting 
after the long-delayed budget for fiscal 1994, which started 
April 1, passed the Diet. 
  Fujii also said his ministry must avoid issuing 
deficit-covering bonds and should continue pursuing efficient 
budget allocations. 
  Brushing aside any intention to present new fiscal measures 
ahead of the July summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) leading 
industrialized nations in Naples, Fujii repeated that it is now 
"most important" to steadily implement the outlays in the budget 
for the 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package approved by the Diet 
in February. 
  The outlays include 5.5 trillion yen income tax cuts.
