GRAHAM QUITS TROY JOB TO COACH AT DON LUGO 
Ed Graham, varsity basketball coach at Troy High School, has resigned his 
position effective April 7 to become an assistant basketball coach at Don Lugo 
High in Chino Hills. 
Graham, 38, compiled a 34-33 record at Troy in three seasons, leading the 
Warriors to two Southern Section playoff berths. He also was an assistant track 
coach and taught English. 
Before coming to Troy, Graham was basketball coach at Orange High School. 
"I moved to Chino Hills five months ago and was spending too much time on the 
freeway and not enough time with my family," Graham said. "I thought the 
commute would be no problem, but I was wrong."
