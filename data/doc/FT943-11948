FT  27 JUL 94 / Mexican candidate injured in crash
The Mexican government yesterday ordered an inquiry into a road accident
that left the left-wing opposition candidate for governor in the southern
state of Chiapas seriously injured, and three of his colleagues dead.
Mr Amando Avendano, of the Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD), was in a
serious condition after his car had collided with a lorry on Monday morning.
He was flown to Mexico City for treatment after suffering a punctured lung,
broken ribs and facial and neck injuries.
Mr Javier Lopez Moreno, the Chiapas governor, said all the information
indicated 'it was a true accident'.
However, Mr Avendano's wife said that she believed the crash had been
planned and was part of a campaign against the movement for peace in
Chiapas.
PRD leaders demanded a meticulous investigation of the crash.
Mr Avendano, an editor of a local newspaper in the town of San Cristobal de
las Casas, has been attacked by local ranchers and other landlords for his
good relations with the Zapatista rebels who began an insurrection in
Chiapas on January 1.
The PRD candidate was on his way to the state capital for a breakfast with
candidates from other parties. The lorry that hit his car was driven on the
wrong side of the road and had no number plate. Its driver fled soon
afterwards, apparently unharmed. Police were reported to be close to
capturing the driver.
The crash has raised fears of further instability in the state of Chiapas,
before the Mexican presidential election and the state election on August
21. Zapatista rebels control a small part of the state and are planning to
hold a 'convention for democracy' early next month.
The PRD has agreed to send observers.
