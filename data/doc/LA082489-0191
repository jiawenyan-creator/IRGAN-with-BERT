THE SIDELINES; 
DRIVER SEEKING SPEED RECORD HURT 
A California driver was injured when he lost control of his vehicle while 
trying to set a speed record at the Bonneville Salt Flats in western Utah. 
Randy Scoville, 43, of Valencia was flown to University Hospital where he was 
listed in stable condition today with rib fractures, a right arm fracture and 
multiple contusions, a nursing supervisor said. 
Scoville was attempting to break the world land speed record for piston-driven 
cars in his Ford Roadster Wednesday afternoon when the vehicle approached 
speeds in excess of 240 m.p.h. and "caught air and began to fly," said Jim 
Ladden, chairman of Bonneville National. The vehicle rolled over several times, 
Ladden said. 
Scoville was attempting to break the 409.27-m.p.h. record set by Bob Summers in 
1966.
