GTE ACQUIRES CELLULAR NETWORK 
GTE Corp. said its cellular-radio unit will pay $710 million in cash to acquire 
the Providence Journal's mobile-phone properties in Virginia, North and South 
Carolina and Georgia -- a price some analysts called "a bargain." 
The deal, exclusive of property and equipment, works out to $189 per potential 
customer among the 3.5 million population in the four-state region. The 
purchase will give GTE Mobile Communications Group a presence in such major 
Southeastern markets as Raleigh-Durham and Greensboro, N.C., Charleston, S.C., 
and Augusta, Ga.
