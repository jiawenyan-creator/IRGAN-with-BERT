FT  17 AUG 92 / Go-ahead for China markets
China will go on developing nascent stock markets despite investor riots in
the southern city of Shenzhen, a Chinese government minister said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Singapore.
Authorities closed the Shenzhen Stock Exchange last week after a rush for
shares prompted unrest, raising concern that China might give up its stock
market venture.
'The incident will not change our policy, we'll go on developing our stock
markets,' said Li Lanqing, minister for foreign economic relations and
trade.
