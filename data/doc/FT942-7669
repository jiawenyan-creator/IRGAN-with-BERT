FT  24 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: South Africa
Early gains were pared in Johannesburg as worries emerged that the higher
bullion price would not hold and in response to initial Wall Street
weakness. The undertone remained firm, however, although many investors were
thought to be awaiting direction from today's speech to parliament by Mr
Nelson Mandela.
The overall index was 50 better at 5,524, industrials added 19 to 6,640 and
golds put on 82 or 4.3 per cent, to 1,990.
Barlows rose 85 cents to R39 in response to its higher half-year profits.
Tobacco stocks remained under pressure.
