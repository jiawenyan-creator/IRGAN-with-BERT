FT  04 MAR 94 / German employers seek to stop strike
Leaders of Germany's engineering workers and employers are expected to meet
in Hanover today in an attempt to avert the first strike in west Germany's
engineering industry for a decade.
The move came last night after almost 40,000 engineering workers in the
German state of Lower Saxony voted in favour to strike on Monday.
The engineering employers' federation, Gesamtmetall, proposed a meeting with
IG Metall, the engineering workers' union. Leaders of the union indicated
unofficially they were prepared to restart talks. The national executive of
the union will decide today in Frankfurt whether to accept the invitation or
insist on a formal offer from the employers before returning to talks.
The vote in Lower Saxony, where more than 92 per cent of the 41,000 eligible
union members voted to strike, gives the embattled IG Metall leadership
ammunition in its efforts to wring an improved package on job security and
wages out of the employers.
It was clear in Hanover, the state capital of Lower Saxony, that the union
saw itself being dragged reluctantly into a full-scale conflict.
However, before the unofficial decision to re-open negotiations, Mr Jurgen
Peters, the chief union organiser in the state, said that if the employers
were proposing talks, without any proper offer, 'it will not be worth our
time . . . . The employers must give clear signals that these will be
negotiations, not just talks.'
Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, president of Gesamtmetall, proposed the direct
talks with Mr Klaus Zwickel, the IG Metall leader, without any indication
that new ideas were on offer.
