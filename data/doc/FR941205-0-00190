Closing information. 

The HFA shall provide final closing information to the Commissioner within 15 days of the final closing in a format
prescribed by the Commissioner. In addition, the HFA shall submit a copy of the amortization schedule. This amortization
shall be used to compute and collect all future mortgage insurance premiums subject to 266.600(c) or 266.602(d).
If the mortgage is modified, the HFA shall submit to the Commissioner a copy of the revised amortization schedule,
which shall be used to compute and collect all future mortgage insurance premiums subject to 266.600(c) or
266.602(d).
(d) 

Due date for premium payments. 

Mortgage insurance premiums are due on the first day of the month of the anniversary of the first payment to principal.
Any premium received by the Commissioner more than 15 days after the due date shall be assessed a late charge of 4 percent
of the amount of the premium payment due. Mortgage insurance premiums that are paid to the Commissioner more than 30
days after the due date shall begin to accrue interest at the rate prescribed by the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual.
