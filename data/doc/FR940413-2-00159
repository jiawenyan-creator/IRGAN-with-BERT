I. Background


In a letter dated May 8, 1992, the Commission's Division of Market Regulation asked the MSRB to review the requirements
of rule G19 on suitability of recommendations and to consider strengthening the requirements for transactions
in certain types of municipal securities.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 In September 1992, the Board published a request for comments on a number of customer protection issues, including
the application of rule G19 to customer transactions.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 After reviewing these matters, the MSRB decided that rule G19 embodies the appropriate general standard for
dealers in making recommendations to customers, but recognized that there was a perception that certain provisions
of the rule could be viewed as permitting recommendations to go forward without proper regard to the nature of the security
being recommended and the customer to whom it is recommended. Accordingly, at its May 1993 meeting, the Board approved
a Request for Comments on draft amendments to clarify and strengthen the suitability requirements of rule G19.
The MSRB requested public comment on the proposal,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 and draft amendments were approved at the November 1993 Board meeting and form the basis of the rule change proposed
herein. Shortly thereafter, 12 groups and associations representing a broad range of market participants submitted
to the Commission a Joint Statement on Improvements in Municipal Securities Market Disclosure.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The Joint Statement called on the MSRB to monitor the effectiveness of its suitability rules and to strengthen those
rules if appropriate.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The Joint Statement specifically called for suitability rules to require disclosure of ratings and whether the issuer
has committed to provide annual financial reports.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 In September, 1993, the MSRB indicated it was considering requiring municipal securities dealers to disclose to
their customers the importance of secondary market information and whether the issuer has agreed to voluntarily
provide such disclosures.
