FT  28 APR 93 / Mideast peace talks reopen
THE NINTH round of Middle East peace talks opened in Washington yesterday
with the Clinton administration showing immediately its commitment to become
directly involved in the negotiations.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, called the heads of the five
delegations, representing Syria, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan and the
Palestinians, to a meeting last night, the first such gathering since the
process was launched in Madrid in October 1991. 'A new sense of urgency and
intensity in the talks must be evident,' he told a US Senate sub-committee
yesterday.
Mr Christopher's initiative was recognition of the frailty of the peace
process, suspended for over four months because of the deportation of 400
Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza. The Palestinian delegation
returned to Washington only after bitter debate, and will be under intense
pressure to withdraw if progress is not made quickly.
Much of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip was paralysed by a strike
yesterday called by Hamas and other radical groups to protest at the
resumption of talks. Anger in the occupied territories has been heightened
by Israel's decision nearly a month ago to seal off the areas, barring
nearly 120,000 Palestinian workers from their jobs. The government yesterday
eased the ban, allowing back 20,000 employed mainly in construction and
agriculture.
Israel is also expected to announce shortly the names of more than 30
Palestinians, deported some years ago, who will now be allowed home.
While these gestures may ease tension in the territories, the Palestinian
delegation will need to show substantial progress towards self-rule if it is
to check increasing radicalisation of the West Bank and Gaza.
