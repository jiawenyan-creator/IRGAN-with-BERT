FT  12 FEB 92 / Letter: US not 'softening' chip agreement with Japan
Sir, Your article on the US-Japan semiconductor agreement ('Fresh cracks in
US-Japan chip pact', February 6) was incomplete. You quoted my statement:
'If the market share is 19 per cent, that will not necessarily be a breach
(of the agreement)'. However, you failed to include the latter part of my
statement: 'And if it is 21 per cent, that will not necessarily mean
compliance.'
The Bush administration is not 'softening' its support for the agreement.
Rather, I have told Japan that we expect full implementation. The level and
growth of foreign market share are of great importance in assessing whether
the arrangement has been fully implemented.
In accordance with the arrangement, we intend to pay 'particular attention'
to market share. In this regard, we are greatly concerned with the apparent
flat trend in foreign market share in the Japanese semiconductor market over
the past year.
The arrangement also calls on the two governments to consider other
'quantitative and qualitative factors'. We regularly review such factors,
including the development of foreign semiconductor design-ins, and other
long-term relationships between Japanese and foreign companies.
The Bush administration will continue to act forcefully to open the Japanese
market for US and foreign semiconductor producers.
