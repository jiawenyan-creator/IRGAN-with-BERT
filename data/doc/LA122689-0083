MUBARAK REPORTEDLY GOING TO SYRIA 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was expected to travel to Syria today, a sign 
of improvement in relations between the two Arab nations, which have been at 
odds since Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, a Beirut daily 
newspaper reported Monday. 
The leftist As-Safir newspaper, quoting Arab sources in Cairo, said that 
Mubarak would pay a two-day visit to Syria starting today and would meet with 
President Hafez Assad. 
Mubarak's expected visit to Damascus followed talks with Syrian Vice President 
Abdel-Halim Khaddam held in Cairo on Saturday, the sources said. Khaddam 
delivered a message from Assad to Mubarak during his 24-hour trip to Egypt. 
Egyptian-Syrian ties started to warm last year after Cairo recognized a 
Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip declared by 
Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Syria 
considers itself a defender of the Palestinian cause.
