FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Party divided on Smith effect
Labour leaders were divided yesterday about the impact of John Smith's death
on the party's strong performance in the European elections.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's campaign manager, said claims that Labour benefited
from a sympathy vote triggered by Mr Smith's death were wrong.
'Nothing could be further from the truth,' Mr Straw told journalists at
Labour's post-election press conference in London.
He said that Labour had gathered 'clear evidence' to the contrary in private
polls taken two and a half weeks ago in the Eastleigh parliamentary
constituency. Labour would have come 'very close' to winning the Eastleigh
by-election - it finished in second place - if Mr Smith had lived.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the party's acting leader, said Mr Smith had played a
part in Labour's strong performance in the European elections and Thursday's
five by-elections.' The credit for these victories goes to the whole team,'
she said. 'That does include the late John Smith.'
Mr John Major, the prime minister, was in no doubt at his post-election
press conference that Mr Smith's tragic death had boosted Labour's vote in
the European elections.
He said: 'This election was held at a time uniquely favourable to the Labour
party, for reasons - some of them sad - that I believe everyone fully
understands.
'Even so, after a deep recession, and on a low turnout, they barely beat the
share of the vote that we achieved in the last general election.'
Many Labour MPs believe the prime minister was wrong to suggest that the
party's vote was artificially boosted by public sympathy, in spite of the
week of national mourning that followed Mr Smith's death.
One senior backbencher pointed out that Labour's 45 per cent share of the
vote in the European elections was in line with the party's opinion-poll
ratings in the weeks leading up to the poll, before Mr Smith's fatal heart
attack.
