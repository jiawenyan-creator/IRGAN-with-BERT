FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Apple sees fourth-term results
above forecasts
Apple Computer expects revenues and earnings for its fourth quarter to be
significantly higher than current Wall Street estimates.
The US personal computer company, which plans to release results for the
year ending September 30 next week, said it expected revenues for the fourth
quarter to be around Dollars 2.5bn, up from Dollars 2.1bn in the same period
last year.
Earnings per share would be 'slightly above 90 cents a share', the company
said. This compares with Wall Street estimates of about 65 cents to 70
cents. Apple's net income was Dollars 2.7m, or 2 cents a share, for the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1993.
The company's share price rose to a 14-month high to close at Dollars 39 5/8
yesterday.
The shares have gained 10 per cent since last Thursday's close of Dollars 36
1/4 amid rumours of an impending agreement with International Business
Machines to establish a common standard for the design of PowerPC-based
personal computers.
Apple uses the PowerPC microprocessor in its latest Power Macintosh
computers. There has also been widespread speculation that IBM might take a
minority stake in Apple to cement such an agreement.
Apple said that demand was strong in the fourth quarter for its entry-level
PCs, Power Macintosh models based on the PowerPC chip and its PowerBook
notebook computers.
The company said it expected gross margins as a percentage of net sales for
the fourth quarter to be slightly above the 26.7 per cent it reported in its
third fiscal quarter. Operating expenses would be slightly less than 20 per
cent of net sales, it added.
