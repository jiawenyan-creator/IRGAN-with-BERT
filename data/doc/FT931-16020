FT  09 JAN 93 / Northern exports campaign launched
A SELF-HELP campaign to double the northern region's manufacturing base and
to treble its export performance within 10 years was launched yesterday
The 'manufacturing challenge' was welcomed and strongly endorsed by many of
the region's business leaders at a packed breakfast-time meeting in
Newcastle upon Tyne.
The campaign is the brainchild of Northern Businessman of the Year Mr Karl
Watkin, chairman of Gateshead-based Crabtree Holdings. The company is the
UK's leading manufacturer of metal-printing machinery, and exports virtually
all its output.
The challenge is supported by union leaders and the Northern Development
Company, the regeneration body for north-east England and Cumbria, which is
hosting three brainstorming sessions during the next few weeks to determine
how the campaign will achieve its aims.
The region was one of the world's pre-eminent manufacturing centres in the
Victorian and Edwardian eras, with a reputation for inventiveness and
workmanship.
Today it exports 44.9 per cent of its manufacturing output, the highest
proportion of any UK region. Twenty-four per cent of its employees work in
manufacturing, compared with a British average of 21 per cent.
