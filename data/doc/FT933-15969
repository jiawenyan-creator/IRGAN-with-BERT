FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Randgold finds mixed results
THE four gold mines in South Africa's Randgold group reported mixed fortunes
for the June quarter, with improved performances at Blyvooruitzicht and
Harmony being offset by losses at Durban Deep and ERPM.
All the mines benefited from the recent strength in the gold price. But they
did not reap the full benefit because most had hedged a 'significant
portion' of production at prices lower than the prevailing spot price. These
lower prices are locked in for as much as a further 12 months.
The most disappointing performance came from Durban Deep, which reported an
after-tax loss of R2.2m (Dollars 660,000) against a R0.5m profit in the
March quarter. Management warned that if margins were not restored 'the
future of operations will have to be reviewed'.
ERPM made a R18.4m loss, up from R13.7m last time. The mine, which has a
large debt burden, suffered an unexpected decline in the underground yield -
to 5.17 grammes per tonne from 5.54 g/t - which resulted in lower gold
production.
Management said the loss for the quarter had raised the possibility of a
funding problem towards the end of the year. The review of the mining and
finance plan is thus still in progress.
Harmony recorded a R1.3m after-tax profit, following a R0.4m loss in March,
while Blyvooruitzicht lifted profits to R5.6m from R3.1m a year ago.
