METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INJUNCTION RESTRAINS ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUP 
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Abby Soven has issued a preliminary injunction 
prohibiting harassment of UCLA faculty members at their homes and other 
disruptive activities by Last Chance for Animals, a group opposed to the use of 
animals in scientific research. 
The injunction specifies that Last Chance for Animals and six of its leaders 
may not threaten, intimidate, harass or annoy faculty at their homes, break 
into or block facilities at the Westwood campus or interfere with or obstruct 
the teaching, research or other functions of the campus. The research in 
question involves cats. 
UCLA spokesman Richard Elbaum said the group has broken into campus 
laboratories where research involving the cats is done and has harassed faculty 
members who are conducting research using animals. 
Christopher Rose, president of Last Chance for Animals, who was named in the 
injunction, said the ruling was "a direct infringement of our constitutional 
rights" that "just goes to show the power of these institutions." 
"They can dictate their own law," he said. "But in no way will this deter us. 
We will prevail." 
Rose acknowledged that his group had demonstrated at the homes of two UCLA 
health-sciences faculty members but denied that the protesters acted 
inappropriately.
