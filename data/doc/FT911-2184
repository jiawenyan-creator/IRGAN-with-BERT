The EC has set in train its long-delayed Ecu400m (Pounds 276m) technical
assistance programme for the Soviet Union, following talks between Mr
Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet premier, and senior EC commissioners in Brussels
on Monday, writes David Buchan in Brussels.
The Commission yesterday expressed the hope that the first projects in such
areas as energy, training, food distribitution, financial services would be
ready in time for a meeting later this month of the EC-Soviet 'mixed
commission'. This, like the technical aid programme itself, was postponed
from January in protest at Soviet strong-arm tactics in the Baltic
republics.
Some Ecu250m worth of food aid destined for the Soviet Union was not
subjected to the same political delay, but has never reached the Soviet
Union, EC officials admitted yesterday.
