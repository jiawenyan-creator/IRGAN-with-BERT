FT  19 DEC 92 / International Company News: Bronfman companies write off
CDollars 1.3bn
THE Toronto Bronfmans' four property companies have written off a combined
CDollars 1.3bn (USDollars 1.01bn) from their balance sheets because of the
slump in North American real estate.
The biggest write-down was CDollars 939m pre-tax by Bramalea, which was hit
by its holdings of Ontario land acquired before the property market
collapsed. Bramalea is now restructuring its debt totalling more than
CDollars 4bn.
Because all four Bronfman companies are inter-related, the Bramalea
write-down had a ricochet effect through the other three companies.
Stock market listed Trizec, in which the Reichmann family has a minority
interest, reported a CDollars 544m loss for the year ended October, after
providing CDollars 668m pre-tax to cover its investment in Bramalea.
Carena, a company which owns 40 per cent of Trizec, posted a loss of
CDollars 245.5m for the year ended October, after total charges of CDollars
271m. Coscan, 56 per cent owned by Carena, warned that a restructuring
charge of nearly CDollars 100m was due.
Bombardier of Canada has confirmed an order for 108 subway cars for the
Ankara subway in Turkey worth Dollars 262m. They will be built in
Bombardier's Ontario plant.
The overall Dollars 660m four-year Ankara contract, covering phase one of
the Turkish capital's subway system, is held by a consortium of Bombardier,
SNC, the Canadian engineering group, plus Gama and Guris of Turkey.
