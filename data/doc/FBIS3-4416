  [Text] Shenyang, March 1 (XINHUA) -- People no longer wear 
gauze masks in winter in this once pollution-ridden capital of 
northeast China's Liaoning Province, thanks to years of hard 
work by the city's environmental departments. 
  In winter the city used to be enveloped in choking dust and 
smoke emitted from central heating systems and factories. 
  From dusk to dawn, in particular, the dust became thicker 
and 
thicker. People had to wear gauze masks when they went out, or 
black dust would pile up around their noses and mouths. 
  "In the 1970's, my whole head and face were covered with 
dust 
whenever I went out for a stroll in the morning," said an old 
resident who lives in the city's busy Taiyuan Street. 
  To eliminate contamination sources and fundamentally solve 
the problem of pollution, the city installed contamination 
monitors high above the ground. Any unit whose discharge 
exceeded the standards would be warned or fined. 
  As a result, departments in the city have been forced to 
renovate their obsolete heating systems. By the end of last 
year all the more than 3,000 old-fashioned boilers had been 
replaced. 
  Meanwhile, the city has installed modern central heating 
facilities. 
  According the city's environmental agency, now 90 central 
heating zones have been built across the city, covering over 90 
percent of heat users. 
  The old forests of chimneys have disappeared, and the 
chimneys left no longer emit black soots. 
  Last year Shenyang reduced its smoke and dust by 10,000 
tons. 
  "The present air is much clearer," said the old resident of 
Taiyuan Street, where there is only one chimney in an area of 
800,000 square meters now. "More and more people step out of 
their home to do physical exercises in the mornings these days," 
he said.
