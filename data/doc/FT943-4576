FT  08 SEP 94 / Arts: Today's Television
For some reason Radio Times describes Waiting For God, which begins a new
run today, as 'gentle'. It is anything but gentle. Vigorous to the point of
violence in its dialogue, it is in several ways better than that other
retirement comedy, 'One Foot In The Grave'. Waiting For God has a powerful
central duo in Graham Crowden and Stephanie Cole, as inhabitants of the
Bayview Retirement Home, and then two sources of strong ensemble acting: the
other inmates and staff of the home, and the ghastly younger members of the
family (8.30 BBC1). After the news, BBC1 begins a fresh batch of another
comedy: Chef] with Lenny Henry as the neurotic and hysterical cook (9.30).
With the UN conference on population and development in Cairo this week, C4
screens a 60-minute documentary called Sex, Sin And Survival which tries to
establish whether the growth in global population is really a time bomb
threatening human existence (9.00). The last programme in BBC2's Hamar
Trilogy about women in south-west Ethiopia is the first new one. It is now
three years since Duka left home to marry a man she had never met (9.30).
