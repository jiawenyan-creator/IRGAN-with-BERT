FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ingersoll-Rand earnings slightly
ahead at Dollars 35.9m
INGERSOLL-RAND, the US industrial and construction equipment manufacturer,
reported third-quarter earnings up from Dollars 34.7m, or 33 cents a share,
to Dollars 35.9m, or 35 cents. The per-share figures reflect a two-for-one
stock split in June.
Operating profits, excluding a Dollars 10m charge for the restructuring of
the company's recession-hit aerospace bearings business, slipped by Dollars
5.2m to Dollars 57.5m. Sales rose from Dollars 866m to Dollars 904m.
Net earnings for the first nine months were Dollars 100.8m, or 97 cents a
share, up from Dollars 95.9m, or 92 cents, on marginally higher sales of
Dollars 2.69bn.
Operating profits in the company's standard machinery segment fell slightly
in the third quarter because of the unstable European economy and resulting
price pressure.
Engineered equipment profits also fell, while the bearings, locks and tools
segment lifted profits, before the restructuring charge.
Mr Theodore Black, chairman and chief executive, said incoming orders for
the third quarter were Dollars 891m, up 8 per cent from the 1991
third-quarter total of Dollars 829m.
