FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Eurotherm shows 47% advance to Pounds 6.7m
EUROTHERM, the control equipment group, yesterday reported a 47 per cent
rise in interim profits after a substantial pruning of its workforce and
overheads.
The pre-tax line at end-April rose from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 6.7m, on sales
only 0.8 per cent higher at Pounds 78.1m.
Mr Jack Leonard, chairman, said the company had encountered the worst global
recession in its 27 year history, and there was no sign of any improvement
at the moment.
The company had misjudged the extent of the economic downturn and had
entered the recession with too many overheads, he said.
During the first half, however, overheads had been cut by Pounds 2m and in
the last 18 months 400, mainly white collar, employees had been shed
reducing the workforce to about 2,300 worldwide.
'We spent the last nine months getting the house in order,' Mr Leonard said.
'Now we have to increase sales.'
While many of the group's markets were in trouble, the water and electricity
companies were flush with cash and a potential market, and the food sector
was maintaining demand in the packaging industry.
Gearing fell from 30 per cent to 25 per cent and the company said cash flow
would remain positive until the end of the year.
Earnings per share rose from 6.7p to 9.97p and the interim dividend rises 20
per cent to 3p.
Eurotherm was founded in 1965 by Mr Leonard and three partners with Pounds
70,000, and its growth has been mainly organic.
Mr Leonard said this pattern would continue, although there might be a time
in the US where Honeywell is a dominant competitor, when the group would
have to acquire in order to build its control business more rapidly.
