  [Text] OPEC is to maintain its current production ceilings 
until the end of the year. The petroleum ministers of OPEC 
member countries were not able to reduce their production 
ceilings at the Geneva session due to opposition by Saudi Arabia. 
  Subroto, the OPEC secretary general, announced at the 
conclusion of the OPEC ministerial session that OPEC will retain 
the ceilings agreed upon for the first quarter of the current 
year until the year's end. 
  Most of the OPEC member countries and some non-OPEC 
oil-producing countries had expressed their willingness to 
reduce oil production in order to boost prices. 
  At the conclusion of the OPEC session, our Petroleum 
Minister 
Aqazadeh announced his displeasure at the latest OPEC decision 
and explained that the responsibility for the consequences of 
this decision will be solely on those who have prevented OPEC 
from reaching a consensus on reducing production and stabilizing 
the market.
