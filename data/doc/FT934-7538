FT  19 NOV 93 / Decline in unemployment accelerates
THE surprising fall of 49,000 in unemployment last month brought the total
to 2.85m and suggests that the jobless total is now on a downward trend.
Although the figures have been erratic since February when monthly falls
first started to occur, the three-, six- and 12-month averages of the
monthly change in unemployment are all negative.
Over the past six months the jobless total has fallen on average by 14,100 a
month, while over the past three months it has fallen on average by 20,400.
The seasonally adjusted rate has dropped to 10.2 per cent, compared with
10.3 per cent in September and a peak of 10.6 per cent at the beginning of
the year.
The unadjusted unemployment total fell in October by 118,534 to 2.79m. This
compares with a fall of 32,954 in October last year.
There were big falls in the male jobless total. This dropped 31,700 on the
month, taking the male rate of unemployment to 13.7 per cent. For women, the
rate was 5.5 per cent following a drop of 17,300 on the month.
These falls were spread fairly evenly across the regions, but were
relatively smaller in the north of England and Northern Ireland.
Other indications that the labour market is benefiting from recovery include
a 7,100 rise in the stock of vacancies at job centres, which account for
about a third of all vacancies. This is an 18.4 per cent improvement on a
year ago.
Also encouraging was a 9,000 month-on-month rise in manufacturing
employment, the second highest increase since August 1989 and the first rise
for two months. The Department of Employment said most of the new jobs were
in clothing and footwear and mechanical engineering.
The number of hours lost through short-time working has in recent months
fallen to the same levels as during the boom of the late 1980s. Overtime
hours worked, at 9.08m, were the lowest since April.
'The speed with which the labour market is responding to the economy's
recovery appears to reflect a rebound from rapid job cuts during the
recession,' said Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers. 'The
recent faster drop in unemployment suggests that overall employment in the
economy may now be rising, whereas the drops in unemployment earlier this
year mainly reflected a shrinking workforce.'
Other figures from the department show that the workforce in employment in
the UK was 29.934m in June this year. This represents a rise of 42,000 in
the second quarter but a fall of 523,000 over the year to June.
The number of people on youth training in August in England, Wales and
Scotland dropped by 1.5 per cent compared with a year ago. Starts on youth
training over the three months to August were 5 per cent lower than over the
same period a year earlier.
