REDS GET GRIFFEY, 40, TO RETIRE TO MAKE ROOM ON THEIR ROSTER 
Ken Griffey, a prominent member of Cincinnati's "Big Red Machine" in the 1970s, 
retired Saturday. 
Griffey, 40, was partially dressed in his uniform when Manager Lou Piniella 
called him into his office before Saturday's game against Pittsburgh. 
Piniella said Griffey, used primarily as a pinch-hitter this season, agreed to 
retire to help the club through a roster problem. 
"I think that's accurate," Piniella said. "I talked to Ken. There were a couple 
of options involved and this is the one he chose. I explained the reason to 
Ken, and it was the roster spot." 
Griffey spoke to the team briefly, then left the clubhouse. He declined to 
comment. 
The Reds needed a roster spot for Chris Hammond, who was called up from 
Nashville on Saturday. 
Griffey started five games at first base and four in left field this season. He 
also pinch-hit 31 times. Overall, he batted .206 with one home run and eight 
runs batted in. 
His son, Ken Jr. of the Seattle Mariners, made the All-Star team this year. 
Griffey spent 13 seasons in the Reds' organization. He was first called up in 
1973 and played his first full major league season in 1975, when the Reds won 
the first of two consecutive world titles. Griffey hit .305 in 1975 and .336 
the next year.
