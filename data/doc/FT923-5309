FT  02 SEP 92 / Japanese car sales decline by 18.6% in August
A FURTHER decline in consumer spending in Japan was signaled yesterday by an
18.6 per cent plunge in car sales during August compared with last year.
The decline is one of the steepest on record and is certain to dash any
lingering hopes of a recovery in car sales in the second half of the year.
The severity of the decline is also an indication of a further erosion of
consumer confidence amid signs that Japan's labour market is slackening
considerably.
Total vehicle sales, including trucks, were off by 16.3 per cent, measured
by vehicle registrations.
None of Japan's leading vehicle makers escaped the decline, although Nissan
sales were particularly hard hit, falling 25.2 per cent. Nissan said on
Friday that it expected to post a net loss of Y20bn (Pounds 80.6m) in the
current fiscal year.
Vehicle sales in the first eight months of the year were down by 5.9 per
cent.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, said yesterday that the total size of the
government's package of emergency economic measures, announced on Friday,
would reach Y12,200bn, compared to the Y10,700 originally announced. The
increase is accounted for by higher spending by public utilities, including
power and gas companies and by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, meanwhile said that Japan's
industrial sector needed to continue with extensive cuts in production in
order to reduce excess inventories. Mr Mieno said that the process of
adjusting inventories, which had begun in the spring, had come to a
temporary halt.
