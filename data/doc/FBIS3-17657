  [Text] We are ready to hold talks with representatives of 
different political forces who sincerely wish peace and 
tranquility in the ancient Tajik land and are ready for 
practical talks, said Minister of Labor and Employment Shukurjon 
Zuhurov, who has been appointed head of the government 
delegation to the talks with representatives of the opposition, 
in an interview with a correspondent of the Khovar news agency 
  Zuhurov stressed that the whole population of the country is 
happy to hear the news pertaining to the start of the talks as 
these talks were going to take place sooner or later. Our 
people are famous for their feelings of friendship and foresight 
over the centuries. It is no secret that the United Nations, 
the Russian Foreign Ministry -- in the person of First Deputy 
Minister Adamishin -- and some other international organizations 
rendered great assistance to us. 
  I would like especially to point out the position of Emomali 
Rakhmonov, the head of state and chairman of the Supreme Council 
of Tajikistan. He has several times announced at the highest 
forums that the leadership of the country was ready for talks. 
  Speaking about the main aims of the talks, Shukurjon Zuhurov 
expressed the opinion that it was expected to discuss the issues 
related to stabilization of the situation of the republic, in 
particular the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border, in the 
course of the talks. The government delegation includes 10 
representatives of all the regions of the republic. It is 
expected that the inter-Tajik talks will take place in the 
capital of the Russian Federation in April of the current year.
