FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: PepsiCo ahead 13% at Dollars
426m in second term
PEPSICO, the US food and soft drinks group, yesterday reported a 13 per cent
increase in second-quarter net income, with strong growth in its snack foods
and beverage business more than offsetting lower profits on the restaurants
side.
The company reported net income of Dollars 426.8m, or 53 cents a share, up
from Dollars 378.8m, or 47 cents, in the same period of last year. Net sales
rose 15 per cent to Dollars 5.89bn.
For the first six months the group reported net income of Dollars 687m, or
85 cents, compared with Dollars 613m, or 76 cents, before accounting changes
in the same period of 1992.
Pepsi said that in the latest quarter its international operating profit
rose 32 per cent. Excluding acquisitions within the last year, sales and
operating profit improved 8 per cent and 11 per cent respectively.
Mr Wayne Calloway, chairman, said he was pleased the company managed to
achieve double-digit earnings per share growth, on top of a 21 per cent
increase in the same period of 1992, despite the cost of a new initiative at
its Pizza Hut restaurant chain.
Worldwide restaurant earnings dropped 5 per cent to Dollars 166.3m on sales
12 per cent ahead. Earnings at Pizza Hut dropped 15 per cent to Dollars
66.5m, with both US and international profits down. The fall in US profits
was due partly to the launch of the new Bigfoot Pizza, a larger, more
value-oriented dish, while the international side suffered from continued
volume declines in Australia and losses in Spain.
Kentucky Fried Chicken saw earnings drop 15 per cent to Dollars 42.4m.
However, snack food profits rose 18 per cent to Dollars 276.3m on a 21 per
cent increase in sales, and beverage earnings rose 18 per cent to Dollars
341.5m on sales up 13 per cent.
The product tampering hoax in the US, where syringes were alleged to have
been found in Pepsi cans, occured after the end of the quarter.
