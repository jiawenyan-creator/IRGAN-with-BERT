FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Sidney C Banks at Pounds 3.4m
Sidney C Banks, the grain and agricultural specialist, announced pre-tax
profits ahead from Pounds 2.87m to Pounds 3.42m for the year to April 30,
despite a fall in turnover from Pounds 280.6m to Pounds 231m.
Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes, chairman, said reforms to agricultural policy
had resulted in a smaller volume of grain being sold which, coupled with
lower prices, led to a reduction in cereal turnover. Other agricultural
sectors performed well. While non-agricultural business also made a good
contribution, competition in the food business adversely affected margins.
Earnings were 25.7p (22.5p). The final dividend is 6.25p, making 9.75p (9p).
