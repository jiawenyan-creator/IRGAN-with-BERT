FT  28 APR 92 / People: Man from the Pru advocates financial derivatives
Colin Stiasny, the man who made the Prudential the biggest institutional
player in London's financial futures and options markets, is quitting to
join MONUMENT DERIVATIVES, a boutique broker which is less than a year old.
After 19 years at the Pru, Stiasny, 41, says that if he was ever going to
make a move he had to do it soon. Martin Burton, managing director of the
16-strong firm, says that Stiasny's arrival gives his firm greater
credibility among its institutional clients.
Stiasny is one of a growing breed of investment managers who regard the
technique of tactical asset allocation with its heavy use of financial
derivatives as an increasingly important investment tool. Although he
refuses to discuss the scale of the Pru's involvement in the use of
financial derivatives, it is widely regarded as one of the keys to its
successful investment performance in recent years.
It is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive for big fund managers to
switch large sums of money between different types of assets at short notice
by traditional means. 'My job will be to persuade other institutions to do
what the Pru was doing and make much greater use of the financial
derivatives,' says Stiasny.
