FT  19 NOV 92 / Observer: Night shifts
So what do Britain's executives do of an evening when they're travelling on
business abroad?
Four in every five of them say they stay working in their hotel rooms, says
a survey by Official Airline Guides. Swiss businessmen are either even more
diligent or less truthful, with nine out of 10 claiming that they do the
same.
By contrast, more than half of their counterparts from Germany as well as
two-thirds of those from Italy admit to indulging in other pursuits. The
difference is that, whereas the Italians typically go out on the town, the
Germans work out in the gym.
