EBERSOL IS NAMED HEAD OF NBC SPORTS 
Dick Ebersol, one of the creators of "Saturday Night Live," Tuesday was named 
the president of NBC Sports, effective May 1. 
He will replace Art Watson, who has been president of the network's sports 
division since 1979 and has been with NBC since 1956. 
Watson, 54, will remain with the network as an executive vice-president until 
his anticipated retirement next year. In his new position, Watson will continue 
to be involved in rights negotiations. 
Ebersol, 41, started at ABC Sports in 1967 as an Olympics researcher and became 
executive assistant to Roone Arledge, the department's president, in 1971. 
Ebersol also was a college football producer. 
At 28, Ebersol became an NBC vice-president after he and an independent 
producer, Lorne Michaels, created "Saturday Night Live" in 1975. Ebersol, 
currently the producer of "Later With Bob Costas," is married to actress Susan 
Saint James. 
Tuesday's announcement came as a surprise. It had been speculated that when 
Watson retired, either Ken Schanzer, current executive vice-president of 
sports, or Al Barber, the network's executive vice-president who oversees 
sports, would become president. LARRY STEWART
