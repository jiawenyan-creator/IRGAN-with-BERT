FT  01 MAY 92 / Fraudulent banker faces Dollars 8bn fine and jail
A FORMER Buenos Aires banker has been sentenced to five years in jail and
fined Dollars 8bn for 'aggravated economic subversion' and fraudulent
administration of a bank that failed in 1980.
Mr Raul Pinero Pacheco was accused of ruining Banco de Intercambio Regional
by diverting loans to companies he owned. He was a director of the bank when
it collapsed owing Dollars 1.3bn to clients. Fines and interest on that
amount compounded over the years are calculated at Dollars 8bn. However,
when bailiffs attempted to seize Mr Pacheco's assets, they found that he had
no personal wealth. He remains free while he appeals against sentence.
Mr Pacheco was only one of a number of businessmen and bankers who set up a
constellation of banks and finance houses during a period of financial
deregulation during the late 1970s. Lax supervision and a climate of
speculation led to massive fraud calculated at Dollars 15.8bn at the time as
banks collapsed under the weight of bad loans made to their owners and
directors.
Mr Roque Fernandez, central bank president, has said bank crashes were one
of the causes of Argentina's heavy inflation and collapsing public finances
during the 1980s as the central bank was forced to take on private
liabilities, through its unlimited deposit guarantee scheme. It repaid
depositors by printing money.
The wheels of Argentina's judicial system grind slowly and only a few
bankers have been tried for offences that took place over 10 years ago. Mr
Pacheco has suffered the heaviest punishment yet.
Many prominent bankers, businessmen and politicians are also accused of
similar financial scandals, but have yet to come to trial. Among them are
former members of President Carlos Menem's entourage.
