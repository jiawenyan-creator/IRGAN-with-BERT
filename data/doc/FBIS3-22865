  [Text] Svobodniy-18 (Amursk region) March 18 TASS -- "The 
state will pay virtually nothing to create the Svobodniy 
cosmodrome in the Russian Far East," Major-General Aleksandr 
Venediktov, chief of the main centre for testing and application 
of space technologies (Svobodniy cosmodrome) said in an 
interview with ITAR-TASS on Friday. 
  "There are enough missile silos and infrastructure left by a 
missile division which operated here, to start space 
explorations," he added. Besides, many servicemen and missile 
specialists will remain at the cosmodrome to work, he noted. 
  Venediktov sees his main task in preparing the cosmodrome 
for 
operations and in providing it with adequate equipment. 
  The reduction of the missile division which was on duty in 
Svobodniy-18, started in 1992 under the START II Treaty. The 
last regiment was released from duty here less than a month ago. 
  The cosmodrome needs twice the number of commissioned 
officers now, but the new tasks have to be tackled with the 
present personnel. Venediktov hopes that new specialists will 
come here, including graduates from the Mozhayskiy Military 
Space Engineering Academy.
