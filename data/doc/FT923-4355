FT  08 SEP 92 / Pound slips against DM
STERLING closed half a pfennig weaker against the D-Mark in London yesterday
in spite of attempts by EC finance ministers at the weekend to inject some
calm into the foreign exchange markets.
Currency trading was thin because of the Labor Day holiday in the US. But
investment in D-Marks continued, pushing the pound down to a close of
DM2.7950, less than 2 pfennigs above its floor in the European exchange rate
mechanism.
The dollar also traded weakly, closing unchanged at DM1.4030.
