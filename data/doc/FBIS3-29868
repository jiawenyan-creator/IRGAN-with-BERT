  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- The government will not 
raise the guaranteed minimum price paid to farmers for milk for 
use for butter and other dairy products in fiscal 1994, Japan's 
farm minister said Tuesday [22 February]. 
  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Eijiro Hata 
told 
reporters no such raise is being considered to deal with the 
scheduled conversion of nontariff barriers into tariffs for milk 
imports as agreed on at the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade 
talks in December. 
  A ministry advisory panel, the Livestock Industry Promotion 
Council, is expected to decide next month on the price for the 
year beginning April 1. 
  Farmers' organizations are calling for a raise in the price 
they receive for milk, currently 76.75 yen per kilogram, in the 
face of expected competition with imports.
