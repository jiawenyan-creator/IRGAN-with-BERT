FT  02 SEP 93 / Arts: Today's Television
TELEVISION has often portrayed modern farming methods as hostile to
wildlife. We see ancient hedges ripped out, copses destroyed, and ponds
drained to create vast plains of corn or rape with no shelter for animal
life. Survival paints a different picture. According to this programme (7.30
ITV) 'Modern crops have offered new opportunities and many creatures have
altered their ways to take advantage of the seeds of change'.
BBC2 screens the first of six half-hour documentaries called Plain Tales
From Northern Ireland, a parody title which unfortunately lacks the point of
Kipling's original pun. Today's programme is about the Nelsons, a farming
family whose children were held hostage by the IRA (8.00).
In Witness Ludovic Kennedy presents the case for 'the good death': voluntary
euthanasia. He talks to those in favour, including Dirk Bogarde, and those
against, including Cicely Saunders, founder of the hospice movement (9.00
C4). Pandora's Box ends its repeat run with the story of the rise and fall
of nuclear power (9.30 BBC2). Not the merriest night, though BBC2 does also
repeat A Bit Of Fry And Laurie (9.00).
