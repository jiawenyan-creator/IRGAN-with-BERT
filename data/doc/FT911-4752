FT  18 APR 91 / The Finance Bill: Foreign companies set to benefit from
change - VAT Group Treatment
particularly in the financial services sector  - will benefit from the
change to the regulations concerning VAT treatment for groups of companies.
These should make company accounting more convenient and should ease cash
flow.
Following Royal Assent, an overseas company will be eligible for VAT group
treatment if it has an established place of business in the UK, rather than
if it is resident.
The advantage of VAT group treatment is that it allows groups of associated
companies to account for VAT under a single registration number. It means
that VAT does not have to be accounted for on transactions between such
associated companies. The amendment is intended to reduce the administrative
burden on companies.
At present, a foreign company - for example a bank with a London branch
which is active in various areas in financial services - is not allowed VAT
group treatment unless it is resident in the UK.
Many foreign companies cannot meet this residency qualification because it
means that at least one director with full voting rights has to be resident
in the UK.
