FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: BHF advances to DM342m
THE Berliner Handels-und Frankfurter Bank (BHF) yesterday rounded off a
robust reporting season for Germany's banking sector. The Frankfurt-based
merchant banking group announced partial operating profits up by 15.5 per
cent to DM283m (Dollars 174.7m) and full operating profits - which include
the bank's own account trading results - up 18.5 per cent to DM342m.
As with its competitors, which have reported record profits in recent days,
BHF enjoyed the benefits of a mixture of strong loan demand, good overseas
lending business and improved stock market conditions.
Growth was more pronounced for the parent bank, which had greater exposure
to the buoyant domestic banking market. Partial operating profits rose 30
per cent to DM244m and full operating profits rose by 32 per cent to DM303m.
Mr Klaus Subjetzki, the bank's senior partner, said that the parent bank's
profits for the first three months of the year were 'clearly ahead' of the
same period last year. However he said it was too early to predict whether
this performance could be sustained for the entire year.
As previously announced, the 1991 dividend will be increased by DM1 to DM13
an ordinary share.
Interest income rose by 20.4 per cent to DM436m last year at the parent
bank, and the interest rate margin rose from 1.58 per cent to 1.72 per cent.
Commission income rose by 5.3 per cent, reflecting variable conditions in
different areas of commission-earning business.
