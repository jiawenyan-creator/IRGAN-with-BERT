  [Text] Haikou, May 19 (XINHUA) -- An industrial port and 
refinery project which will refine six million tons of crude oil 
was launched today in south China's Hainan Province. 
  The Jinpai International Industrial Port is a main part of 
Hohbond petrochemical project, top among the 14 ongoing large 
projects in the province. 
  The Hohbond project, located in the northwest part of this 
island-province and wholly foreign-financed, is expected to have 
an output value of 14 billion yuan. 
  It will exert great impact on the province's economy, since 
Hainan has so far grossed 10 billion yuan in annual industrial 
output value. 
  The Hainan Hohbond International Petrochemical Ltd. has a 
registered capital of 210 million U.S. dollars. 
  To cost 900 million yuan, the industrial port will go into 
operation in June, 1996. 
  The port, 70 kilometers west of the Yangpu Development Zone 
and separated from Vietnam and provinces of Guangdong Province 
and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region by sea, has favorable 
natural conditions to be a good harbor. 
  In addition to the Hohbond project, the other important 
items 
in Hainan include a heat and power plant with a generating 
capacity of 300,000 kilowatts, a harbor which can handle 30 
million tons of goods, a storage and transportation base and a 
reservoir. 
  All of them will be under construction this year.
