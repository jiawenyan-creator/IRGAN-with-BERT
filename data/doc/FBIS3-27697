  [Text] Tokyo, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji reiterated today that China will not change 
the system in Hong Kong after 1997 when Beijing restores its 
jurisdiction over the British colony. 
  "Hong Kong will be a special administrative zone after 1997 
with special laws," Zhu told a news conference at the Japan 
National Press Club. "Therefore, there will be no change in its 
system." 
  He said the Chinese Government will continue to protect the 
interests of foreign-funded firms there and work hard to make a 
more prosperous Hong Kong. 
  Zhu, who arrived here Wednesday [23 February] for a nine-day 
visit, lashed out at the so-called "flexible diplomacy" pursued 
by Taiwan, apparently referring to the recent visit to Southeast 
Asian nations by Taiwanese "President" Lee [Li] Teng-hui. 
  He said his government had lodged protests with the 
Southeast 
Asian nations -- Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand -- over 
the issue. 
  On Japan's ties with Taiwan, the vice premier said he 
believes that Tokyo "will not hurt the feelings of the Chinese 
people."
