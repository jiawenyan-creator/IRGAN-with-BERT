  [Text] Brussels, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Military chiefs from 
NATO countries, Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics met 
here today over cooperation including joint exercises and 
training. 
  Chiefs of staff from more than 30 countries gathered for the 
third time since the end of the Cold War to discuss the 
"Partnership for Peace" plan and peacekeeping in Europe. 
  About 14 countries from Eastern Europe and former Soviet 
republics have signed up for the plan. Angered by NATO's recent 
military action in Bosnia, Russia has postponed the signing. 
  Under the Partnership scheme, there were plans for one 
military exercise on land and one at sea this year, Sir Richard 
Vincent, the chairman of NATO's military committee told a news 
conference. 
  Earlier today, speaking at the meeting, Vincent said 
valuable 
progress had been made in "helping safeguard peace through 
active cooperation on defence matters and military contacts." 
  "It is increasingly evident that this cooperative 
approach...is a practical and useful element in our attempts to 
provide stability and peace," Vincent added.
