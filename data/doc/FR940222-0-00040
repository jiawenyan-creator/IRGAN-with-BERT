For the purposes of CHAMPUS, a pastoral counselor is an individual who meets the following requirements:
(

educational institution in an appropriate behavioral science field, mental health discipline; and
(

2

) The following experience:
(

) Either 200 hours of approved supervision in the practice of pastoral counseling, ordinarily to be completed in a
2- to 3-year period, of which at least 100 hours must be in individual supervision. This supervision will occur preferably
with more than one supervisor and should include a continuous process of supervision with at least three cases; and
(

ii

) 1,000 hours of clinical experience in the practice of pastoral counseling under approved supervision, involving
at least 50 different cases; or
(

iii

) 150 hours of approved supervision in the practice of psychotherapy, ordinarily to be completed in a 2- to 3-year period,
of which at least 50 hours must be individual supervision; plus at least 50 hours of approved individual supervision
in the practice of pastoral counseling, ordinarily to be completed within a period of not less than 1 nor more than 2
years; and
(

(c)(3)(iv)(D) of this section for more specific information regarding licensure); and
(

) The services of a pastoral counselor meeting the above requirements are coverable following the CHAMPUS determined
allowable charge methdology, under the following specified conditions:
(

i

) The CHAMPUS beneficiary must be referred for therapy by a physician; and
(

ii

) A physician is providing ongoing oversight and supervision of the therapy being provided; and
(

iii

) The pastoral counselor must certify on each claim for reimbursement that a written communication has been made or
will be made to the referring physician of the results of the treatment. Such communication will be made at the end of
the treatment, or more frequently, as required by the referring physician (refer to 199.7).
(

5

) Because of the similarity of the requirements for licensure, certification, experience, and education, a pastoral
counselor may elect to be authorized under CHAMPUS as a certified marriage and family therapist, and as such, be subject
to all previously defined criteria for the certified marriage and family therapist category, to include acceptance
of the CHAMPUS determined allowable charge as payment in full, except for applicable deductibles and cost-shares
(i.e., balance billing of a beneficiary above the allowable charge is prohibited; may not bill beneficiary for noncovered
care). The pastoral counselor must also agree to enter into the same participation agreement as a certified marriage
and family therapist with the Office of CHAMPUS within which the pastoral counselor agrees to all provisions including
licensure, national association membership and conditions upon termination, outlined above for certified marriage
and family therapist.





Note: 

No dual status will be recognized by the Office of CHAMPUS. Pastoral counselors must elect to become one of the categories
of extramedical CHAMPUS provides specified above. Once authorized as either a pastoral counselor, or a certified
marriage and family therapist, claims review and reimbursement will be in accordance with the criteria established
for the elected provider category.
