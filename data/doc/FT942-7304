FT  26 MAY 94 / Interest rates 'may be forced up soon': Action foreseen to
keep inflation within target
Interest rates will have to be raised by a full percentage point within the
coming months if inflation is to be kept below the government's target of 4
per cent, a leading economic research body warned yesterday.
Although raising rates might be politically unwelcome for the government,
the new climate of openness means that the Bank of England increasingly has
the upper hand in setting inflation policy, the National Institute of
Economic and Social Research says in its latest quarterly report.
'The publication of the minutes of meetings between the chancellor and the
governor . . . has left the government with surprisingly little room for
manoeuvre,' the report says.
'(The government) has allowed a situation to develop in which it is
difficult for the Bank's advice on interest rate moves to be rejected,' the
report adds, pointing out that the Bank itself is increasingly inclined to
approve increases in interest rates.
The main factors that will persuade the Bank to raise rates before the end
of the year are the growth in earnings and money supply, the report
suggests. Average earnings have grown at a slower-than-expected rate, but
are expected to grow 3.5 per cent this year and 5 per cent next year.
Meanwhile M0, which has been growing by 6 per cent, is expected to continue
rising well above the government's 4 per cent monitoring range.
These factors have not triggered inflation yet, says the institute, which
admits that its own inflation predictions - among the gloomiest in the City
 -have become more optimistic since February.
It says inflation will rise only a 'little over the next year or two' from
its current underlying 2.3 per cent, if base rates are brought in line with
the level of interest rates now expected in the markets.
But with the markets now assuming that interest rates will rise to 6 per
cent by the end of the year, and 7 per cent by 1995, this implies a
significant rise from their current level of 5.25 per cent, it points out.
This rise will have to occur within 12 months. However, if earnings and
money aggregates grow, it will have to take place much sooner, the report
says.
These interest rate rises should not seriously affect recovery, the
institute says. Its more upbeat predictions for the growth in gross domestic
product have been revised up to 2.9 per cent this year, from 2.7 per cent.
Consumer spending will continue to grow, by 3.5 per cent this year, it
suggests. Unemployment is predicted to continue falling until it reaches
about 2.5m next year. Public debt is predicted to be Pounds 35.3bn this
year, a little below the Treasury forecast. Meanwhile, manufacturing
investment is predicted to rise by 6 per cent this year, and 8 per cent next
 -a pattern that the institute describes as 'a classic investment cycle'.
But elsewhere in the report the institute notes that the calculations used
to measure competitiveness may have been painting an overly flattering
picture of labour productivity.
Although the UK has had significantly higher rates of growth in
manufacturing labour productivity, measured in terms of output per hour,
unit labour costs measured in a common currency are rather less impressive,
the report notes, adding that it is still difficult to reconcile some of the
different statistical techniques used in different countries.
