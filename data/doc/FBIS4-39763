  [Text] At the government's sitting Thursday first Vice 
Premier Oleg Soskovets spoke in favor of gradual restoration of 
Russia's positions on the world arms market. 
  "We have lost too much in this sphere and we must restore 
our 
positions step by step," he underlined. Soskovets reminded that 
in the time of the USSR the Soviet arms export was 30 percent of 
the world one and the share of the United States was 35 percent. 
The situation has radically changed now. As of today, the 
share of the Russian Federation in arms export is five percent 
and the United States controls almost 65 percent of the world 
market. 
  Addressing the sitting of the Cabinet, Soskovets was 
critical 
of several leaders of federal ministries and departments due to 
a low executive discipline and weak control over the situation 
in some concrete branches of industry. In particular, the 
question concerns the Russian Federation committee on Machine- 
Building and Atomic Energy Ministry.
