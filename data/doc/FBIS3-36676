  [Text] The responsibility for the tragedy in Sarajevo 
cannot be laid on the Serbs, since "no one has proved that they 
are to blame for it yet," the Russian Foreign Ministry 
spokesman, Mikhail Demurin, said at Tuesday's [8 February] 
briefing in Moscow. 
  According to him, in the present circumstances to launch air 
strikes on Serb positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be "the 
least appropriate solution." 
  With reference to the recent letter addressed by the UN 
Secretary General to NATO, Demurin said that it concerned 
primarily actions that lie beyond resolutions issued by the UN 
Security Council. "NATO's readiness to launch air strikes is one 
thing, and the taking of a political decision is another. This 
is a prerogative of the UN Secretary General in consultations 
with the Security Council, where Russia will necessarily have 
its say," he pointed out.
