P. M. BRIEFING; 
COSTLY IMPORTS TRIM JAPAN EDGE 
Japan's current-account surplus shrank 70% in April, its sharpest drop since 
June, 1979, due in large part to a jump in costly imports that reflects the 
expensive tastes of its consumers, especially for artworks, economists said 
today. 
Japan's surplus in its unadjusted current account, the broadest measure of 
trade in goods and services, narrowed to $2 billion in April from $6.58 billion 
a year earlier and $8.13 billion in March, the Finance Ministry said.
