THE STATE 
A developer who is building more than 860 apartments in a San Francisco 
neighborhood has hired a consulting firm to help stop a proposed baseball park 
nearby because of possible noise and traffic congestion. The Cleveland-based 
Forest City Development reportedly paid $10,000 to back "San Franciscans for 
Planning Priorities," which describes itself as a community-based movement 
supported by neighborhood activists and environmentalists. The group is urging 
citizens to write Mayor Art Agnos and Spectacor Management Group, a 
Philadelphia firm that is negotiating with the city to develop a ballpark and 
arena.
