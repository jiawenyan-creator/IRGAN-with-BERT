A 16-year-old boy was shot and killed and an adult companion wounded in Logan 
Heights, police reported Tuesday. 
The two were standing in front of a house in the 2400 block of K Street shortly 
before 11 p.m. Monday, when several shots were fired at them from a car that 
had stopped nearby, said Dave Cohen, a Police Department spokesman. 
The light-colored car then sped off. Police believe there were at least two 
people in the car. 
Cohen said police found several shotgun and semiautomatic casings at the scene. 
The 16-year-old, Javier Martinez, was shot in the chest and stomach. He was 
pronounced dead on arrival at UCSD Medical Center. His companion, Jorge H. 
Torres, 21, was shot in the upper thigh and ankle. Torres was discharged 
Tuesday, said hospital spokeswoman Nancy Stringer. 
Police believe the shooting was gang related, said Lt. George Saldamando of the 
department's gang unit. He said the unit is helping homicide detectives.
