THE SIDELINES; 
KRUKOW CITES SHOULDER, RETIRES 
Pitcher Mike Krukow, the San Francisco Giants' only 20-game winner in the last 
17 years, announced his retirement today because of continuing shoulder 
problems. 
Krukow, 38, became a free agent last October after a torn rotator cuff injury 
that ended his season in June. 
He was 4-3 with a 3.98 ERA during his shortened 1989 season and finished his 
career with a 124-117 record and a 3.90 ERA in 369 major-league games with the 
Chicago Cubs, Philadelphia Phillies and Giants. 
After going 20-9 in 1986 to become the Giants' first 20-game winner since Ron 
Bryant in 1973, Krukow was limited by recurring right shoulder problems and 
went only a combined 16-13 in his final three seasons. 
"I tried to get my shoulder back into shape this winter, but I just don't think 
it was meant to be," Krukow said from his Pasadena home. "I have no problem 
with this decision."
