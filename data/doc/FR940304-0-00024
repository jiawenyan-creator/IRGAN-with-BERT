 

Options-Futures Spread



&bull;Short Call-Long Futures or Short Put-Short Futures.

&bull;The underlying market value of the option plus the margin required for the underlying futures contract less
half of the amount that the option is in-the-money. Minimum: market value of the option plus 50% of the margin required
on the underlying futures contact (futures speculator or hedger rate, as the case may be).

&bull;Long Call-Short Futures or Long Put-Long Futures.

&bull;The margin required is the greater of the market value of the option or the margin required on the futures contract.



Other Combinations



&bull;Special rules apply to calculate margin requirements for other combinations.



Position Limits



The maximum number of options and underlying futures contract net on the same side of the market in all contract month
combined which a person may own or control shall be as follows:

(a) For speculators: 5,000 futures equivalent contracts.

(b) For hedgers: The greater of 7,000 futures equivalent contracts or of such a limit to be established and published
on a monthly basis by the Exchange based on 20% of the average daily open interest for all Canadian Bankers' Acceptance
futures contract during the preceding three calendar months or such other position limits as may be determined by
the Exchange.

For the purpose of calculating these limits, positions in the options contracts are aggregated with positions in
the underlying futures contract. For aggregation purposes, the futures-equivalent of one in-the-money options
contract is one futures contract and the futures-equivalent of one at-the-money option or out-of-the-money contract
is half a futures contract.



Reporting Levels



300 options or 300 futures equivalent contracts for positions involving the option and the underlying futures contract.
