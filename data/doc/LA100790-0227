VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MAN, YOUTH HELD IN STABBINGS AT BEACH 
Detectives have arrested a Saticoy man and a Ventura teen-ager in connection 
with the beach stabbings of two Ojai teen-agers last Sunday. 
Ramon Mendez Lopez, 26, is being held at the Ventura County Jail on suspicion 
of violating his parole. 
Police plan to charge him with attempted murder on Tuesday, said Detective 
Douglas Auldridge of the Ventura Police Department. The 15-year-old is being 
held at Juvenile Hall, he said. 
Both were questioned on the night of the stabbing but were released because 
police had inadequate evidence, Auldridge said. After an investigation, he and 
Detective Pat Stevens arrested Lopez at his home about 11 a.m. Friday and the 
teen-ager about 4 p.m., he said. 
The teen-ager, who police believe associates with members of a Ventura gang 
called the Avenue Gangsters, is the main suspect, Auldridge said. It is unclear 
whether the attack was gang-related, he said. 
One stabbing victim, 15-year-old David Foyle, remains in critical condition in 
the Ventura County Medical Center with more than 20 stab wounds, Auldridge and 
a hospital spokeswoman said. David and a companion, Brady Sabat, 19, were 
beaten with sticks and stabbed repeatedly at the beach across from Ventura 
Harbor about 12:10 a.m. last Sunday. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ
