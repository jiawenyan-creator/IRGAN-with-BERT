FT  09 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: The song of the border reivers
FT-SE Index: 2,523.4 (-17.1)
The long-term investment case for Hydro-Electric and Scottish Power rests on
them being seen as border reivers, lurking in their northern fastnesses,
ready to invade the English electricity market and grab what they can.
Of the two, Hydro-Electric fits the tale more neatly. An aggressive new
management; a smaller business, tilted towards generation; little reliance
on the vulnerable industrial market; and two mooted power projects in
England - all this adds up to an appealing story.
Scottish Power, a likely Footsie stock, has been slower off the mark. But
both have an edge on their English rivals. As integrated utilities, they
have much more scope for shifting costs and profits around the company, to
keep them away from the regulators.
In yesterday's pathfinder prospectus, the government has given each a bit
more debt than expected. Dividend cover, at 2.1, seems a bit low compared
with the expected 2.5 or so, even if you allow for tax to drop back to more
normal levels.
If English raids help profits to grow, these are small drawbacks. To that
hope, two caveats. A bigger interconnection with the south, as planned, will
allow raids both ways - and the English generators get access to cheaper
coal two years ahead of the Scots. Meanwhile, rushing to build in England
may offset part of the Scots' attraction; the absence of a pressing need to
invest in new plant.
At the flotation, such calculations will mean little. Only one thing will
count: how much the need to keep Scotland's electricity Scottish prevents a
full allocation for overseas demand.
