FT  01 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Governor pushes up sterling
STERLING was boosted against both the D-Mark and the dollar yesterday after
the governor of the Bank of England said he was not seeking lower interest
rates and the UK authorities held a successful auction of government bonds,
writes James Blitz.
The pound had weakened to about DM2.4100 by the start of London trading but
finished at DM2.4275, leaving a rise of  1/2 pfennig on the day. Its
performance against a weak dollar was as strong, with the UK currency
piercing the important resistance level of Dollars 1.4980 and closing at
Dollars 1.5055, up  3/4 cent on the day. In New York it finished at Dollars
1.5140.
Several factors lifted the pound in an otherwise quiet market. Mr Robin
Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank of England governor, said he would like to see a
stronger exchange rate for the currency and that Britain should pursue a
policy of stable exchange rates. Most of the pound's move upwards took place
while he was giving evidence to British MPs.
Sterling also strengthened after the government's auction of Pounds 3bn of
20-year gilts - the largest gilt auction ever - went successfully. The
auction was covered 1.96 times and gilts rose a full percentage point.
Mr Robin Aspinall, an economist at Panmure Gordon in London, said the
success of the auction should push the pound higher. 'We have had a major
focus of attention on this auction and it went well,' he added. 'Sterling
should now be the flavour of the month.'
One measure of the pound's strength was that it rose in spite of a more
modest easing in the Bundesbank's money market tender rate than had been
expected.
The Bundesbank's repo rate dropped 8 basis points to 8.17 per cent, while
some dealers had been expecting the repo to be cut down to 8.10 per cent.
The modest repo rate cut was one reason behind another weakening in the
dollar, which fell as low as DM1.6065 in European trading and closed a net
3/4 pfennig down at DM1.6125. The dollar also hit another all-time low
against the yen, sinking to Y114.55 before finishing at Y114.90. In New York
the US unit ended at DM1.6069 and Y114.78.
The dollar's weakness against the yen was partly due to the end of the
Japanese fiscal year yesterday, which always gives the US currency problems.
However, the dollar could be undermined further by the perception that the
US economic upturn in the first quarter of this year has not proved as
strong as the one in the last three months of 1992. US leading indicators
for February, issued yesterday, rose 0.5 per cent when market forecasts had
been for an increase of 0.6 per cent.
The Italian lira took a breather yesterday after two disturbing days,
closing stronger at L989.7 to the D-Mark from a previous L990.1. The French
franc eased back a few notches in late European trading but closed unchanged
on the day at FFr3.396.
