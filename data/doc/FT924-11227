FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Volksbank warns of lower
full-year result
SWISS VOLKSBANK expects its 1992 results to fall below last year's level as
the result of higher provisions and write-offs, Reuter reports from Berne.
The bank said that cash-flow before tax, provisions and write-offs could be
up to 10 per cent below 1991's SFr382.9m (Dollars 312.2m). In 1991, it
reported a group net profit of SFr68.4m.
The Bank said it would change its legal status into a conventional joint
stock company from a co-operative.
The step would give the bank more possibilities of self-financing via
capital markets.
Swiss markets have speculated that Volksbank could be a merger or takeover
candidate in the light of recent poor results.
However, the company added: 'There is no plan for any participation of
another company in Volksbank.'
The change would widen the circle of investors interested in the bank.
'The co-operative stock is not an actual security and makes it more
difficult in Switzerland, and in particular abroad where our legal structure
is hardly understood, to placing our stock and raise capital,' the company
said.
The bank also plans to increase its stake in Odier Bungener Courvoisier, the
French private bank, to 51 per cent from 20 per cent.
Volksbank acquired its stake in the bank, which operates in commercial and
merchant banking and in asset management, in the spring of this year.
