THE SIDELINES; 
FAN INJURED AT RAIDERS GAME REMAINS IN CRITICAL CONDITION 
A Pittsburgh Steelers fan from Arizona who was knocked unconscious Sunday at 
the Raiders game at the Coliseum remained in critical condition today, hospital 
officials said. 
Paul Albrecht, 35, of Tucson suffered a head injury that left him "unconscious 
and unresponsive," County-USC Medical Center spokeswoman Adelaida de la Cerda 
said. 
"He is conscious and starting to respond, but he is still in our intensive care 
unit," she said. 
Shane Geringer, 19, was booked for investigation of assault with a deadly 
weapon, Police Lt. Rich Molomy said. Geringer later was released after posting 
$22,000 bail, Molomy said. 
Witnesses said Albrecht had been taunting Raiders fans throughout the game. 
Then a Raiders fan walked over to him and punched him, knocking him to the 
ground. While he was on the ground he was kicked in the head.
