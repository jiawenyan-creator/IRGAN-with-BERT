 

Funding levels vary significantly between operational tests and are primarily based on size, complexity, and funding
commitment by each of the partners. Federal ITS funding for the operational tests selected from the open solicitation
in FY 1993 and FY 1994 ranged from $200,000 to $5.5 million, with most of the tests falling in the $1 to $2 million range.
