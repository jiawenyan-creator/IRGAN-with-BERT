FT  17 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
Stock index futures ended the day little changed, but once again trading
volume was far in excess of the recent average, writes Jeffrey Brown.
With two-way business remaining strong, contract numbers during pit trading
hours totalled 16,708, against 19,792 on Tuesday.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3152 at the official 4.10pm close, up
just one point. The premium to the cash market was 3 points, short of fair
value at 4 points.
Propelled by favourable UK inflation data, the market opened strongly and by
mid-morning the December contract was running at a premium to cash equities
in excess of 20 points.
But the general enthusiasm was tempered during the afternoon session when
Wall Street, the immediate key to direction, made a faltering start to the
day.
The December contract managed to edge up a few further points in late,
screen-based trading and traders took distinct encouragement from the level
of volume, which moved above 19,000 contracts.
Stock option volume also powered ahead, rising to 56,430 lots from 44,538 on
Tuesday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trading exceeded 30,000 lots. Forte was the
most active stock option at 2,450 lots, followed by two major banks, NatWest
(1786) and Barclays (1736).
