UCI NAMES COACH FOR WOMEN'S SOCCER 
Keith Comfort, a former UC Davis women's soccer coach, has been hired to coach 
the UC Irvine women's soccer team, the university announced Tuesday. 
Comfort, who coached at Davis from 1985-88, was named the Northern California 
Athletic Conference coach of the year in 1988 when the Aggies were ranked 13th 
in NCAA Division II. 
He replaces interim coach Steve Shaw, a UC Irvine student who has graduated. 
Comfort graduated from Davis in 1984 and played three years on the Aggies' 
men's soccer team, earning All-American honors as a goalkeeper.
