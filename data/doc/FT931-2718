FT  18 MAR 93 / Life policy sales face sweeping changes
SWEEPING CHANGES to the way life insurance policies are sold will today be
proposed by the Office of Fair Trading.
For the first time independent life insurance sales agents would be required
to tell prospective customers the commission earned on each policy sold, and
agents would be able to undercut each other on price.
Life insurance companies would also have to spell out the value of policies
surrendered before their maturity dates.
The changes, which must be approved by the Treasury, could hit so-called
direct and tied sales agents who account for most new policies sold by
traditional life insurance companies. These outlets charge more than
building societies or independent financial advisers which have lower
commission costs or overheads.
The proposals come after years of wrangling between the life insurance
industry and regulators. The OFT has already rejected two sets of proposed
rule changes by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
regulatory watchdog, on grounds that they failed to promote sufficient
competition. The OFT has argued that consumers know too little about costs
to be able to make wise choices among a variety of available policies.
The life insurance industry has strenuously rejected efforts to force it to
disclose individual costs to consumers and has also fought against price
competition in policy sales.
Lautro, the industry's self-regulatory body, has argued that high-cost
outlets will be obliged to tell customers they can buy products more cheaply
elsewhere under the 'best advice' rules of the Financial Services Act.
Under the proposals, the OFT will urge that customers be shown illustrations
of investment returns taking into account each company's charges on
policies.
