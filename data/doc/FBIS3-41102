  [Text] Foreign Minister Fernando Ochoa Antich denied 
statements by Colombian authorities regarding an increase in 
coca and marijuana crops on Venezuelan territory. He considered 
them to be "a campaign to discredit Venezuela's image." 
  "I am concerned with such statements because possibly a few 
laboratories and coca crops exist in the Venezuelan border 
area--the country's most inhospitable zone (...) but to say that 
Venezuela is a country where cocaine and marijuana are 
extensively grown is to lie," the minister stated. Ochoa 
pointed out that "there has been a very conspicuous campaign of 
comments against Venezuela in the past days. As foreign 
minister, I categorically reject such comments." 
  He added that "Colombia and Venezuela, as neighboring 
countries, have to review and reevaluate our bilateral policies. 
There are sectors in both countries that sincerely want 
integration. However, there are also sectors that maintain a 
radical position against Venezuela; I will always reject them." 
  Omar Baralt, the head of the Venezuelan delegation at the 
Border Affairs Commission, also questioned Colombia's attitude 
regarding border issues and especially regarding the illegal 
trafficking of stolen vehicles. He said, "Colombia does not 
dare implement drastic measures" to stop this activity because 
"it fears the border will be paralyzed." Baralt explained that 
80 percent of the vehicles in the border area are Venezuelan. 
His statements were made after the Border Affairs Commission 
presented a final report to Venezuelan President Ramon J. 
Velasquez after four years of work. 
  Enrique Vargas, head of the Colombian delegation at the 
commission, emphasized that Colombia and Venezuela have worked 
jointly to identify more than 70 common problems. He said that 
"incidents that prompt friction are not good but they are 
inevitable."
