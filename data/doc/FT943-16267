FT  05 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: UK gilts top world league
table for June
UK government bonds outperformed the rest of the world's bonds in June, as
core European markets moved higher.
The JP Morgan government bond index shows a return for gilts of 0.72 per
cent, measured in local currency.
Second came Germany, with 0.5 per cent. Australia was the worst performer,
with a return of minus 3.07 per cent, just below Spain, Italy and Japan. The
average rate of return across all countries was minus 0.57 per cent.
'Investor sentiment is being influenced by anecdotal evidence that European
bond market performance may be bottoming out after several months of sharp
decline,' the report said.
Gilts were boosted by the government's white paper on pension industry
reform, while economic growth remained in line with expectations and
underlying inflation figures were revised downwards.
Worries over the government's commitment to controlling the budget deficit
hit the Italian market, while Spanish bonds suffered from political
uncertainty following the European parliamentary elections.
However, 'concerns centring upon the US dollar and bond markets, as well as
uncertainty over the timing of future US interest rate increases, continued
to weigh heavily upon the global fixed-income markets', the report
emphasises.
Over the last three months, the report shows that the UK has been one of the
worst performers with a rate of return of minus 4.27 per cent.
