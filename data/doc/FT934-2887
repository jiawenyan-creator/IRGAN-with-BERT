FT  11 DEC 93 / UN blocks Bosnian Serb fuel
Angered by repeated Serb blockades of fuel to Bosnian government
strongholds, UN relief officials yesterday cut off fuel deliveries to
Serb-held parts of Bosnia, writes Laura Silber from Belgrade.
'The Bosnian Serbs  ..agreed to these deliveries. They have now reneged on
the deal,' the UNHCR said yesterday.
Despite another pledge in Geneva last week by the leaders of the three
warring parties to allow free access for relief convoys, the Bosnian Serbs
yesterday again blocked a convoy headed for Gorazde, the desperate Moslem
enclave in south-eastern Bosnia designated a UN 'safe area'.
