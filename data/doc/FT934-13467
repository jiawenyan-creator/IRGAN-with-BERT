FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: UAP upbeat as profits climb 15%
midway
MR JEAN Peyrelevade, chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP),
France's largest insurance group, said yesterday the company was on the road
to recovery. This was in spite of the depressed conditions which persisted
in some of its markets.
His forecast came as the company announced results for the first six months
of the year showing net profits of FFr599m (Dollars 103.6m), an increase of
15 per cent over the corresponding period in 1992. Mr Peyrelevade said the
group was on course for full-year profits of between FFr1.5bn and FFr2bn. In
1992, profits fell 70 per cent to FFr1.08bn.
The recovery in profits should improve the prospects of privatisation for
the group, which is one of the 21 publicly-owned companies scheduled for
sale. Industry analysts in Paris said it was likely UAP would be privatised
early next year.
UAP's privatisation hopes have also been boosted by the resolution earlier
this month of a long-running wrangle with Suez, the French industrial and
financial holding company. An agreement between the two groups gave UAP
control of Colonia, the German insurer.
The increase in first-half profits was achieved despite an increase in
losses at Banque Worms, the group's troubled banking subsidiary. Losses and
provisions at the bank represented a negative contribution to group results
of FFr615m compared with FFr221m in the same period in 1992.
UAP said the increased losses from its banking activities reflected the fact
that Banque Worms took most of its provisions for 1992 in the second half of
that year, while this year they will be concentrated in the first half.
Mr Jacques-Henri Gougenheim, chairman of Banque Worms, said the bank's
full-year loss for 1993 should be half the FFr1.65bn deficit recorded last
year.
UAP's insurance division and the finance and property division both recorded
a strong performance. The insurance activities raised profits from FFr739m
to FFr949m, while property and finance was up from FFr430m to FFr756m.
The group's insurance turnover rose 8.5 per cent to FFr71.2bn. Premiums in
life assurance increased 8.6 per cent to FFr34.9bn, while premiums in
accident insurance rose by a similar proportion, to FFr36.3bn.
Mr Peyrelevade said some markets remained depressed. He singled out the
property market and casualty insurance, where claims levels remain a
concern.
Profits from the group's overseas operations enjoyed a strong first half,
with the figure rising to FFr599m from FFr319m in the first six months of
1992. Overseas activities represented 57 per cent of the group's insurance
turnover during the period.
