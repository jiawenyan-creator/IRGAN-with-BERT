FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Scots parliament plan
dismissed
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, yesterday dismissed Labour's plans to
set up a Scottish parliament as a recipe for the break-up of the UK.
Underlining the government's commitment to a wholehearted defence of the
union, Mr Lang told a conference fringe meeting that only Scottish
nationalists would benefit from home rule.
Scottish independence would follow devolution 'as night follows day' as
nationalists circled 'like vultures' around the constitutional wreckage
created by Labour, he said.
In a speech underlining the approach adopted by the government after the
last general election, Mr Lang promised full recognition of Scotland's
status.
'We have taken more concrete steps in recognition of Scotland's status as a
nation than any government since 1707,' he said.
Mr Lang said that Labour's devolution proposals 'rank as one of the most
irresponsible positions ever adopted by a party seeking to be elected'.
He said the plan would cost Scotland its voice in the cabinet, cut the
number of Scottish MPs and lead to a smaller share of resources for
Scotland.
