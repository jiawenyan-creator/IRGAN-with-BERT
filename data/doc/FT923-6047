FT  27 AUG 92 / Mafia fighter
Ms Liliana Ferraro, a 48-year-old lawyer, has been appointed to succeed
senior anti-Mafia offical Giovanni Falcone, Reuter reports from Rome.
Ms Ferraro will be named the director-general of the Justice Ministry's
Penal Affairs division, the post Mr Falcone held when he was killed in a
bomb blast set by the Mafia three months ago in Sicily. She had been head of
his secretariat for the last 18 months and had been standing in for him
since his death.
