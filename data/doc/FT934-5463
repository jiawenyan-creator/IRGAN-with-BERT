FT  30 NOV 93 / Lecturers vote for disruption
Lecturers at seven further education colleges are to take industrial action
over new contracts which would halve their annual holidays and add an hour
to each working day.
At Furness College in Cumbria two-thirds of lecturers voted for indefinite
strike action while workers at other colleges voted to work to rule or to
ban marking registers.
A further 14 colleges plan ballots as part of the campaign being run by the
National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education against the
new contracts.
Plans for a national one-day strike in September were abandoned when the
Colleges Employers' Forum, which represents most college principals, agreed
to start national negotiations.
In September the employers agreed to stop introducing the new contracts,
which affect only people starting a new job and people being promoted.
Ms Sue Berryman, Natfhe negotiating secretary, said: 'This local action
shows the strength of feeling around the country and members' determination
to resist the introduction of sub-standard contracts.'
But the forum described the votes as a breach of the spirit of the September
agreement. It said that December 31 had been set as a deadline for the
talks, and that Natfhe had agreed to suspend any action until then.
Mr Roger Ward, chief executive of the forum, described Natfhe as 'lions led
by donkeys'.
He added: 'They are throwing their ground forces into attacking the
introduction of modern managerial practices which the further-education
sector has been avoiding for 15 years.'
