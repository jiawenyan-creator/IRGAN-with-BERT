FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Tie Rack shares fall on warning
Shares in Tie Rack fell by 8p to 146p yesterday after the fashion neckwear
and accessories retailer warned that its performance this year could be
undermined by overseas recession and UK tax increases.
The group, which stocks products ranging from designer scarves to Winnie the
Pooh ties and Pink Panther socks, said sales in the current financial year
were below expectations and it was cautious about prospects.
Mr Roy Bishko, chairman, said: 'Consumer expenditure and confidence may be
affected adversely by tax increases. Overseas, France and Holland are
experiencing difficult market conditions and in Australia, despite the
improving economy, the retail environment is depressed.'
In the year to January 30, Tie Rack defied volatile consumer spending to
increase pre-tax profits by 31 per cent to Pounds 6.67m (Pounds 5.1m).
The improvement was underpinned by a strong performance in Britain - where
operating profits rose by 24 per cent to Pounds 5.72m - and continental
Europe, which contributed Pounds 1.95m (Pounds 1.14m).
Group operating profits increased to Pounds 6.15m (Pounds 4.5m) on turnover
of Pounds 78.2m (Pounds 67m).
Mr Bishko said sales were boosted by 37 new outlets, increasing the
portfolio to 301.
Their contribution, however, was hampered by increased US losses of Pounds
482,000 (Pounds 58,000).
Falling sales forced the group to close six stores in North America at a
cost of Pounds 350,000. Trading losses exceeded Pounds 130,000.
The figures were also affected by difficulties in France, where demand fell
and distribution was hit by transport strikes.
Mr Bishko said the group wanted to expand its airport division - comprising
25 shops in 15 countries - and open more stores in Europe and east Asia.
Funds would come from its year-end net cash balances of Pounds 11.2m (Pounds
7.4m).
Earnings rose from 6.1p to 8.04p and the dividend is increased to 1.75p
(1p).
