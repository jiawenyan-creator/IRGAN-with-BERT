FT  05 NOV 93 / Banks to delay Brazil debt accord
BRAZIL and its leading bank creditors have agreed to delay the completion
date of an accord covering the restructuring of more than Dollars 35bn of
debt. The delay is to allow more time for negotiation with the International
Monetary Fund.
Mr Andre Lara Resende, Brazil's chief debt negotiator, said yesterday the
target date for completion had been put back from February 28 to April 15.
Signing of the bank deal will begin on November 29.
The February closing date implied that an IMF agreement - necessary for the
bank accord to be completed and for the issue of US zero coupon bonds as
collateral - would be in place by early January, which now looks unlikely.
The IMF wants the government to balance its operating budget in 1994, and
fiscal measures planned by the government to do this have been delayed. Mr
Resende said the government hoped to have unveiled the measures by
mid-November. An IMF team due to arrive in October will now arrive on
November 15 or 20.
He said he had no indication if the Dart family, which holds 4 per cent of
the outstanding debt and which has been refusing support for the accord, had
changed its position. Banks holding 95.11 per cent of the debt have
indicated they will accept the agreement, and 95 per cent must sign for it
to become effective.
