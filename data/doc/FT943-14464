FT  14 JUL 94 / Sky to offer up to five new satellite TV services
Sky Television is planning to launch a number of new television services,
possibly as many as five, over the next few months.
The satellite television venture yesterday announced the first of the new
services - a second Sky Sports package which will be launched on August 19.
Also under consideration is a travel channel, an education channel and a
science fiction channel.
The aim is to take a number of programme services from cable television to
strengthen Sky's Multi-Channel package of subscription channels.
The new services could also lead to an increase in the prices of some of Sky
subscription packages. At the moment all the services offered by Sky
Television cost Pounds 19.99 a month.
Sky declined to comment on whether prices would change once the new services
were introduced.
The new line-up is not likely to be complete channels. The services will
almost certainly be segments of programming added to the total Sky package
by splitting existing channels.
To begin with, for example, Sky Sports 2 will only broadcast at weekends.
The new sports service will give schedulers an extra 50 hours of airtime to
broadcast more live sport and documentaries.
The new weekend service will be free to existing Sky Sports subscribers.
Sky Television is owned by British Sky Broadcasting, a consortium in which
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake.
