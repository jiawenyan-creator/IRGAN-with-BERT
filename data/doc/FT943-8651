FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: SeaCon net income at Pounds 6.4m and asset
disposal considered
Sea Containers, the Bermuda-based leisure, ferry and container leasing
group, reported flat net income of Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.4m) compared with
Dollars 10.4m, for the second quarter to end-June. Profits before income tax
fell from Dollars 11.2m to Dollars 10.7m.
For the six-month period, profits before income tax fell from Dollars 14.4m
to Dollars 3.44m, although the company said the comparison was distorted by
the fact that in the first half of 1993 it made a substantial gain on the
sale of a factory, as well as significant foreign exchange profits.
Revenue for the quarter rose from Dollars 102.8m to Dollars 114.2m, while
for the six-month period it increased from Dollars 183.9m to Dollars 199.5m.
Mr James Sherwood, president, said the board had decided not to go ahead
with its previously announced share offering, as the current share price is
too low and market conditions too weak. However, he said it was considering
an asset sale later in the year.
