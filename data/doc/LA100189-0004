I am writing regarding the KABC-TV story covering the Cleland House Community 
Center in East Los Angeles, which appeared on the station's 6 p.m. news on 
Sept. 12. Too many times the Mexican-American community receives attention from 
the media only when there are negative or sensational stories to report. I 
appreciate and applaud the decision to highlight the positive programs, 
activities, staff and clients at Cleland House.
