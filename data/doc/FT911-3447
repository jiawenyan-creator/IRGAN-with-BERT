FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (5): US complains China has dollars 10.4bn
visible surplus on trade
The US complains that China has a Dollars 10.4bn visible surplus on its
trade with the US. It says that only Japan and Taiwan maintain larger
surpluses. As a result, US officials are pressing China to import more from
the US.
However, China claims that trade is more or less in balance, with a Dollars
1.4bn surplus in the US's favour in 1990.
One must look to Hong Kong to understand this startling difference. The US
trade figures include imports that transit the colony en route from China to
the US, and vice versa. But China regards its sales to the US via Hong Kong
as exports to Hong Kong. US products entering China from the colony are seen
as imports from Hong Kong, not the US. Neither side is ready to alter its
trade accounting practices.
