FT  29 JUL 93 / Durable goods orders rise sharply in US: Three-month decline
reversed
ORDERS for durable goods climbed sharply last month in the US, providing
some underpinning for more optimistic assessments of the economic recovery.
The Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods rose by 3.8 per
cent between May and June, reversing three months of decline.
Although the sharp rise was heavily dependent on a 42 per cent surge in
aircraft orders, a particularly volatile segment of the statistics, cars and
electronic components also rose.
Transport sector orders rose by 15.1 per cent, the department said, while
orders for electronics and electrical equipment went up by 3.3 per cent.
Primary metals orders increased more modestly, and orders for industrial
machinery and equipment fell by 1 per cent.
Shipments, however, showed a more evenly spread increase of 2.3 per cent
from May to June, with transport equipment up 4.8 per cent, primary metals
up 3.5 per cent, and electronics and electrical equipment up 3.3 per cent.
Although figures for earlier months were revised downward, making
yesterday's month-on-month increase appear larger, economists noted that
durable goods orders were still 6 per cent higher in June than they had been
a year earlier, and orders for the first six months of the year were almost
8 per cent higher than in the same period of 1992.
With government spending severely constrained and consumer confidence still
shaky, capital investment has been among the principal motors of the stolid
US economic recovery.
The 10.9 per cent rise in capital goods orders last month largely reflected
new aircraft orders, but even if aircraft and parts are excluded, capital
goods orders still rose 0.7 per cent in June.
