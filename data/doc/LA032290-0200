ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; 
MAN'S KILLER SOUGHT, MAY HAVE CUT HAND 
Police sought the assistance Wednesday of the medical community in solving the 
slaying of a 32-year-old Fullerton man. 
Police said Brian McNamara was discovered Tuesday at the Best Inn Motel in the 
8000 block of Garden Grove Boulevard. 
McNamara was partly undressed and had been stabbed several times, Lt. John 
Woods said. 
Police said money, possibly as much as $100 or more, was taken by McNamara's 
assailant. 
Woods said investigators believe that McNamara's attacker was injured and might 
have suffered cuts on his hand. "We are seeking assistance from the medical 
community as the suspect may seek medical treatment for injuries or already 
obtained it," he said. 
Police have not recovered the murder weapon, Woods said. 
Police and motel officials said McNamara checked into the motel about 1 p.m. 
Monday and paid for an overnight stay. 
A maid discovered the body around 4 p.m. Tuesday. 
"All she did was walk in and walked out when she saw blood everywhere on the 
carpet," said Retha Clinton, the motel manager's wife. "After she came and got 
me, I went in. He was lying on the floor between the bed and the wall. It was a 
terrible shock."
