FT  03 JUN 92 / Young man's game
Paul Selway-Swift, 48, is the obvious beneficiary of last week's boardroom
reshuffle at the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (the
HongkongBank). Selway-Swift, who is responsible for the group's operations
in Hong Kong and China, is far and away the youngest of the three new
executive directors promoted to the board of HongkongBank, the main
operating subsidiary of the HSBC Holdings parent.
In addition to Selway-Swift, Tony Townsend, 57, and Richard Hale, 55, have
been appointed to the board of HongkongBank. Along with Willie Purves and
John Gray, chairman and deputy chairman of HSBC Holdings, the three new
executive directors make up the top management team of the group's
traditional business in the Asia-Pacific region.
Following last year's reorganisation, the boards of the HongkongBank and its
parent HSBC Holdings, which also controls group companies outside the
region, are being separated. Although they will continue to share some
common directors, the intention is that the HSBC Holdings board will have a
more international flavour. At present the board is dominated by local Hong
Kong businessmen.
If the group succeeds in taking over Midland Bank it has promised to put Sir
Peter Walters and Brian Pearse, chairman and chief executive of Midland
Bank, on the HSBC board along with Richard Delbridge, Midland's finance
director. Two of Midland's eight independent non-executive directors, Sir
Patrick Meaney and Geoffrey Maitland Smith, have also been promised seats.
If the takeover is consummated, Midland directors would have six of the 22
seats on the board, assuming no other changes.
