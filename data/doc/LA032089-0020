EASTERN AIRLINES 
In response to your article regarding how pilots hope to slow air travel, Part 
I, March 7: 
What is the difference between a hijacker who takes the public captive and 
Henry A. Duffy and his ALPA who propose taking the air travelers captive? 
As one who still suffers from the effects of sitting in an airplane on the 
Tarmac in Chicago without air conditioning for several hours during the air 
controllers' slowdown of the late '70s, I fail to understand the rationale of a 
group who claims to be interested in the safety and welfare of the public. I 
believe the answer lies in one word -- greed -- or "Look out for ourselves and 
the public be damned." 
The effect on passengers is the same whether they are hijacked by a terrorist 
or by the Airline Pilots Assn.!
