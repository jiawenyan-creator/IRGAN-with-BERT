FT  02 SEP 92 / Swedish capital flows out
AS MUCH as SKr22.1bn (Pounds 2.3bn) of capital flowed out of Sweden last
week in the crisis of financial confidence that forced the central bank last
Wednesday to raise its interest rate by 3 percentage points to 16 per cent,
writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm.
The outflow - much larger than expected - is the biggest since last November
after Finland's devaluation of the markka forced Sweden's central bank to
raise its interest rates by 6 per cent. Capital reserves have now fallen to
SKr95.2bn.
During the past two days the money markets and the bourse in Sweden have
remained nervous about the immediate economic outlook.
Short-term interest rates have continued to rise since the middle of last
week. Yesterday the bourse general share index fell by 2.6 per cent. This
followed a 0.9 per cent decline on Monday.
Sweden's centre-right coalition government continues to insist no new
economic measures are needed to deal with the financial crisis.
