FT  26 MAR 92 / Observer: Spare wheel for Morley
There's a hint of the dual-personality about psychologist Kevin Morley,
Rover's new marketing supremo.
On the one hand, he is managing director of the motor group's marketing
division with a non-executive seat on the main board. On the other, he has
just launched his own marketing company, Kevin Morley Group, which so far
has only one client: Rover.
But he dismisses the idea of conflicts of interest. Not at all, says the man
who claims never to have failed in anything he has done. After all, Rover is
only the first of the new company's clients.
Besides signing up Jack Rubins, McCann Erickson's former UK head, as its
chairman, Morley has recruited some bright ad-sparks to run the Rover
account, won from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's BSB Dorland agency.
Paul Jackson and Stuart Kendall who worked on the account at BSB, have
crossed over to become executive director (client services) and director
(head of art) respectively. Steven Smith has left the Birkdale group to be
finance director, and Richard Smith is leaving J Walter Thompson in Detroit
to be creative director.
Whatever Morley is paying them, he has found a bargain in his Marble Arch
headquarters. Each of its 8,250 square feet is costing him only Pounds 9 or
so, whereas until the recession a Pounds 50 rate would have been modest.
As for his new role at Rover, the buzz is that it has been handed to him as
solace for not being given one of the motor group's really top-flight jobs.
But he didn't seem crestfallen at yesterday's launch of his own company.
Clasping a bumper of celebratory wine and spreading his arms wide, he asked
Observer: 'Call all this second best?'
