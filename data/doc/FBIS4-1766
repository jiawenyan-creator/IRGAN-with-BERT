  [Text] Hohhot, April 3 (XINHUA) -- The telephone system of 
Hohhot City has been totally digitalized, with 20,000 
program-controlled telephone lines newly added to the network, 
official sources here said. 
  The sources said this has increased the total lines of the 
city to 50,000, a great relief of the former shortage of lines 
in the capital of northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous 
Region. 
  The city has been investing heavily in upgrading and 
expanding its telecommunications system in recent years to cope 
with the ever-increasing demands upon the telephone network 
accompanying rapid economic growth. 
  The city now has 13 telephone lines for every 100 citizens, 
which ranks eighth among the Chinese provincial capitals, 
according to the sources. 
  The city now provides direct calls to 1,600 Chinese cities 
and over 800 overseas cities.
