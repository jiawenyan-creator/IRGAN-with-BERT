 

However, additional issues remain to be resolved. These include, among other things, full implementation of the
Uruguay Round Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs) text, most importantly with respect to patents,
trade secrets, copyrights and semiconductor layout designs. The two governments are also discussing issues related
to fair and equitable access to the Brazilian market for U.S. industries that rely on intellectual property protection.

The original deadline for determinations under section 304(a)(1) of the Trade Act with respect to the investigation
was November 28, 1993. Because the issues that remained outstanding at that time were complex and required additional
time for resolution, the deadline by which the determinations must be made was extended until February 28, 1994. See
58 FR 64351 (December 6, 1993). In accordance with section 304(b)(1)(A) of the Trade Act, USTR invites the presentation
of views of interested persons concerning the foregoing determinations. In particular, USTR would like written
comments on whether the Government of Brazil's acts, policies or practices with respect to the outstanding issues
noted above are unreasonable and constitute a burden or restriction on U.S. commerce, and, if so, on what actions,
if any, would be appropriate. The United States in the past has determined that removal of Generalized System of Preferences
benefits and/or increased tariff rates are appropriate after a determination has been made that a trading partner
fails to provide adequate protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.
