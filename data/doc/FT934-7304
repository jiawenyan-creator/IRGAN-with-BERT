FT  20 NOV 93 / Spending on cars boosts growth
CONSUMER spending, much of it on cars and durable goods, was the main
support of UK economic growth in the third quarter, government figures
indicated yesterday.
The Central Statistical Office reported that consumer spending increased in
real terms by a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent in the third quarter
compared with the second quarter, and by 2.4 per cent compared with the
third quarter of 1992.
By contrast, revised figures for UK gross domestic product confirmed a late
October report that the economy grew by just 0.6 per cent in the third
quarter. GDP grew by 1.9 per cent compared with the same period of 1992,
just under the 2 per cent annual growth estimated last month.
Overall domestic spending on goods and services increased by just 0.3 per
cent in the quarter and by 1.4 per cent compared with last year. This was
depressed by Pounds 423m of de-stocking and low government consumption,
which grew only 0.2 per cent in the quarter and 1.1 per cent over the past
year.
Investment rose by 1.3 per cent in the third quarter after falling 2.9 per
cent in the previous three months, and was 1 per cent up on the third
quarter of last year.
