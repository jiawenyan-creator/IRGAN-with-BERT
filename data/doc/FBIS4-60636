Iran's Offer To Settle Dispute over Abu Musa Island"] 
  [Excerpt] Abu Dhabi -- Diplomatic sources in Abu Dhabi 
have confirmed that Iran offered nothing new in its proposal to 
hold talks with the United Arab Emirates [UAE] in a bid to 
settle the dispute between them over Abu Musa Island. 
  The sources said that "this proposal is incomplete," and 
Iran 
must express its willingness to hold comprehensive talks on the 
three islands -- Tunb al-Kubra, Tunb al-Sughra, and Abu Musa -- 
which Iran occupied in 1971. 
  The sources pointed out that, since the suspension of direct 
talks between the two countries in September 1992, Iran has been 
talking about the possibility of resuming negotiations over Abu 
Musa Island. But the UAE believes that this is insufficient and 
that the negotiations must include the three islands. The 
sources said that the statements made by 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, 
speaker of the Iranian parliament, regarding the resumption of 
bilateral talks "are not serious and are insufficient." 
  UAE President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan stresses 
that Iranian calls to resume the dialogue over Abu Musa Island 
"bring nothing new and are still remote from what we are 
thinking about." 
  Shaykh Zayid is urging Iran to refer to the International 
Court of Justice so that each party can submit its evidence of 
its ownership of the three islands. [passage omitted]
