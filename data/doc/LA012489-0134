CONSUMERS MUST BE WARNED ABOUT FORMALDEHYDE, BENZENE 
Two substances commonly used in building materials are also listed by the state 
Health and Welfare Agency as causing cancer and requiring warnings when 
consumers are exposed to them in sufficient amounts: 
Formaldehyde -- Found in a broad range of building materials, including 
adhesives, carpeting, plywood and paneling. Under Proposition 65, consumers 
must be warned when exposed to 15 micrograms or more a day in a form that can 
be inhaled, eaten or absorbed through the skin. 
Benzene -- Commonly used to manufacture roofing materials. Consumers must be 
warned when exposed to levels above 20 micrograms a day. 
Thomas E. Warriner, undersecretary of the Health and Welfare Agency, said he 
believes that most new homes do not contain high enough levels of formaldehyde 
or benzene to pose a health threat or to require warnings under Proposition 65.
