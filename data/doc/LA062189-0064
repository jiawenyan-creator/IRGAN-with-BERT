THE STATE 
Actress Jane Fonda spent the night alone on a mountain after becoming separated 
from her companions while backpacking in Sequoia National Park, park officials 
said. Fonda, 51, who was unharmed, did not panic when she realized she was 
lost, said her publicist, Steve Rivers. She wrapped herself in a blanket and 
ate a sandwich while she waited for help to arrive, he said. After Fonda's 
companions notified authorities that she was missing, a helicopter crew found 
Fonda on top of a mountain, officials said.
