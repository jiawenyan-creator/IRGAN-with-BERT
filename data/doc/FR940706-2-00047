SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 15, 1991 (56 FR 40614), stating that temporary tolerances had been renewed for the combined residues of the
herbicide triclopyr (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyloxyacetic acid) and its metabolites 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol
and 2-methoxy-3,5,6-trichloropyridine in or on the raw agricultural commodities rice grain at 0.5 part per million
(ppm) and rice straw at 8.0 ppm, and for triclopyr in poultry meat, poultry fat, and meat byproducts (except kidney)
at 0.2 ppm, poultry kidney at 1.0 ppm and eggs at 0.3 ppm. These tolerances are renewed in response to pesticide petition
(PP) 8G3571, submitted by DowElanco, 9002 Purdue Rd., P.O. Box 681428, Indianapolis, IN 46268. 


The company has requested a 1year renewal of the temporary tolerances to permit the continued marketing of
the above raw agricultural commodities when treated in accordance with the provisions of the experimental use permit
62719-EUP-8, which is being renewed under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended
(Pub. L. 95396, 92 Stat. 819; 7 U.S.C. 136). The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated,
and it was determined that renewal of the temporary tolerances will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary
tolerances have been renewed on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the experimental use permit
and with the following provisions: 

1. The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the experimental
use permit. 
2. DowElanco must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing on safety.
The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the records available
to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. 
These tolerances expire June 23, 1995. Residues not in excess of these amounts remaining in or on the above raw agricultural
commodities after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during
the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit and temporary tolerances. These
tolerances may be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on
this pesticide indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health. 
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order
12866. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
