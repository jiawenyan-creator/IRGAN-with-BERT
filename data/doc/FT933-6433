FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Sharp turnround at Mallett
Mallett, the antiques dealer, returned to profit in the first half of 1993,
making Pounds 409,000 pre-tax. Last time the loss was Pounds 485,000.
Turnover rose from Pounds 3m to Pounds 5.13m as business gradually improved
over the period with a very good result in June. Margins were not as high as
the company would have liked but that was the result of selling a number of
items on commission.
The directors stated sales in the second half have so far held up well.
Earnings per share were 1.98p (losses 3.51p). Interim dividends are restored
with a payment of 0.5p.
