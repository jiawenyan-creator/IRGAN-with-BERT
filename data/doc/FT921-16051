FT  07 JAN 92 / Letter: The realities of Sunday trading - in the UK, and for
Virgin in France (2)
Sir, your article ('France to ease Sunday trading laws slightly', December
31) on the Virgin megastores' battle with the French authorities over Sunday
opening contained a couple of inaccuracies.
Far from 'angering' our own staff, we have 100 per cent support from them,
and they turned up en masse at court in support of our decision to open on
Sunday, December 29 (they know we will use only volunteers to work Sundays).
Although the court fined us, the judge said that we were right to fight for
something with such wide public support.
As a result of our stance, the French minister of employment has publicly
announced that he will meet the head of our retail division to discuss a
formula for cultural shops (records, books, etc) to be allowed to open on
Sundays.
Sunday trading is an issue that we will not 'back down over'. Patrick
Zelnick,
president,
Virgin France
