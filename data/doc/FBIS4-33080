  [Text] In order to eliminate subsidies, the Sugar Industry 
Ministry is relying on two main paths, production increase and 
cost reduction. This was announced by Ramon Aguila, chief of the 
Ministry's finance department. In order to attain this goal, a 
number of measures are being adopted. These include allocating 
higher amounts of fuel to those tasks directly tied to 
production, such as soil preparation, planting, and sugarcane 
irrigation. Likewise, the scarce resources available will be 
invested in those enterprises and Basic Cooperative Production 
Units where they will yield the most. 
  The Ministry has also adopted a new policy on investment in 
new projects. These will not be undertaken without a preliminary 
financial study.
