  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- The Ministry of Trade, 
Industry and Energy will eliminate 14 jobs for grade one through 
four officials by dismantling two bureau-class offices and five 
division-class offices under its downsizing plan announced on 
Monday. 
  Under the reorganization scheme to be implemented early next 
month, the three trade-related bureaus will be merged into two 
new bureaus -- one responsible for multilateral trade 
negotiations and the other for regional trade. 
  A new office of the trade councilor will be set up under the 
direct control of the vice minister, with the councilor acting 
as a roving ambassador responsible for trade negotiations with 
foreign countries, Minister Kim Chol-su said. 
  The industrial policy bureau will be expanded into two 
bureaus -- one for industrial policy and the other for 
industrial technology -- while the four industry-related bureaus 
will be reorganized into three bureaus -- one for machinery and 
materials, another for electronics and information and the last 
for textiles and chemicals. The four energy-related bureaus 
will be merged into three new bureaus -- one for energy policy, 
a second for petroleum and gas and the third for electricity. 
  The Korean Trade Commission will dismantle the bureau-class 
office of administration and investigation.
