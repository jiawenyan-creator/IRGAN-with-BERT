COLLEGE HOCKEY; 
FORUM TOURNAMENT; 
NATIONAL POWERS TO MEET TONIGHT 
Top-ranked Minnesota and fourth-ranked Boston College, which played in the 1990 
NCAA quarterfinals, meet today at 4:30 p.m. in the Great Western Freeze-Out 
Intercollegiate Hockey Tournament at the Forum. 
Defending tournament champion Michigan State plays Toronto in the second game 
at 7:30 p.m. 
SportsChannel will broadcast both first-round games and the title game Friday 
at 7:30 p.m. A crowd of about 6,500 is expected. 
Unlike most NCAA hockey teams, the rosters of the Golden Gophers and the Eagles 
are composed entirely of Americans. This season, the Gophers of the Western 
Collegiate Hockey Assn. have an all-Minnesota lineup. 
Under sixth-year Coach Doug Woog, Minnesota (14-1-3) has made four Final Four 
appearances in the past five years. 
Boston College (10-4) has 18 lettermen from a team that was eliminated in the 
NCAA semifinals by eventual champion Wisconsin. Coach Len Ceglarski is college 
hockey's winningest coach at 642-313-35. 
Michigan State (8-8-4) is off to its worst start since 1980-81. 
"I think our team is a little better than our record," Coach Ron Mason said. 
"The biggest thing for us -- we have a lot of outstanding players -- is 
determining roles." 
Three Michigan State players are National Hockey League first-round draft 
picks: goaltender Jason Muzzatti (Calgary), Michael Stewart (New York Rangers) 
and Bryan Smolinski (Boston). 
Toronto (10-9), in its 100th season of hockey, hasn't played since Dec. 2 
because of exams. Coach Paul Titanic played for Mason at Bowling Green in the 
late 1970s. 
Last year, the Spartans beat Alberta, 7-4, in the title game and British 
Columbia defeated Denver, 6-3, in the consolation game.
