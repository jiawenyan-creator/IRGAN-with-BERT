  [Text] The United States regards the planned deployment of 
crisis reaction forces made up of Bundeswehr soldiers and 
voluntary conscripts as a strengthening of Germany's ability to 
act. This was stated by German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
following talks with his U.S. counterpart William Perry. 
  The German defense minister has attributed to the United 
States and Germany a decisive role in bringing about more stable 
international relations. The Americans have expressed 
understanding for Germany's plans to reduce the Bundeswehr to 
300,000 men, Ruehe said. Apart from Germany's armed forces 
reform plans, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and relations 
with Russia were also discussed in the talks. 
  Ruehe will continue his U.S visit with a speech at the West 
Point Military Academy and a troop inspection at Fort Bragg.
