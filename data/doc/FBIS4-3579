cooperatives in China and other countries in the world. 
  Present at the meeting were Yang Bo, chairman of the ICCIC,

  The meeting, which opened here today, will last three days. 
  This is the first meeting of the ICCIC since it resumed

  During the meeting both domestic and overseas ICCIC members 
will hear, examine and approve a report on the work of the

outstanding Chinese Stateswoman Soong Ching Ling as its honorary 
chairman and Rewi Alley as the executive secretary. 
  The committee suspended its work in 1952 and resumed 
activities here in September 1987, thanks to the efforts of 
Rewi Alley and consultations with parties concerned.
