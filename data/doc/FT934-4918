FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Support for loan scheme - Student grants
Conservative MPs gave firm support to the decision to increase the scope of
the higher education loans scheme and reduce student grants.
The changes were strongly criticised by opposition MPs. They claimed poorer
students would be deterred from higher education, while others would be
forced into debt.
Mrs Angela Knight, a Conservative MP with a special interest in education,
said it was right and proper that students should contribute to their living
costs.
'We give a world class university education in this country which gives
students qualifications and the opportunity to get much better jobs.'
Mrs Ann Taylor, the shadow education secretary, said the changes amounted to
a breach of contract between the government and existing students, who would
be left 'high and dry at a time of increasing hardship'.
