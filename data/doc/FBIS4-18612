  [Text] Following the split between Forza Italia and the 
Northern League, the dialogue between the members of the Freedom 
Alliance unexpectedly started up again with a meeting between 
Umberto Bossi and Gianfranco Fini. The leader of the Northern 
League and the National Alliance held an hour-long meeting. Also 
present at the meeting were the parliamentary leaders of the 
Northern League, Roberto Maroni and Francesco Speroni, and the 
leader of the Italian Social Movement parliamentary group, 
Giuseppe Tatarella. 
  "The meeting was an important and positive one. We 
discussed," added Fini, "a number of issues relating to the 
formation of the government." Tomorrow the delegations will 
meet once again, although the party leaders will not be present.
