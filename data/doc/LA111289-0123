STORY OF COMPTON SCHOOLTEACHERS 
It was interesting to read your article titled "Inner-City Teachers: Well, It 
Isn't the Paycheck." (Times, Nov. 5). It was a positive piece reflecting the 
dedication of teachers in the Compton Unified School District. I am proud of 
those teachers and they deserve to be commended. 
My rhetorical question is why did the title say "Inner-City" teachers, as 
opposed to "Compton" teachers? If it had been a negative article, you can bet 
that it would have used the word Compton. In any event, I am on my way to 
personally compliment the Compton teachers you cited for their commitment to 
their profession.
