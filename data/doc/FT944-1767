FT  19 DEC 94 / Stance on effect of new roads attacked
The government's approach to assessing the economic impact of its
roadbuilding programme will be challenged in a report to be published this
week.
A study by the Standing Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment, an
independent group of experts, is expected to show that new roads generate
additional traffic as well as absorbing existing levels.
The government has argued at public inquiries into road schemes that new
roads do not generate additional traffic. Accepting that they do is likely
to increase resistance to its roadbuilding programme.
The committee delivered its report to the Department of Transport nearly
nine months ago but the department refused to publish it then. Environmental
lobbyists said this was because it was afraid of the impact it would have on
roadbuilding.
The willingness to publish the report is seen by some observers as a sign of
the 'greener' approach being taken by Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport
secretary for the past four months.
Previous studies have shown that new roads do generate more traffic. A
report published earlier this year by the British Road Federation showed
that 11 per cent of traffic carried on new roads was a direct result of the
road having been built.
The report of the advisory committee is expected to show a higher percentage
of journeys generated by new roads.
Environmentalists say this is a reason for not building new roads, because
levels of congestion rise. But the federation said that generated traffic
was a sign of increased economic activity and a positive benefit of
roadbuilding.
Mr Mawhinney will soon reveal further details of his roadbuilding programme.
There is expected to be a reduction in the number of motorway widening
schemes.
