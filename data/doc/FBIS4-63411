  [Text] Moscow May 23 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin signed 
six economic decrees on Monday which, according to his economic 
adviser Aleksandr Livshits, allow the government to speed up 
reforms. 
  Livshits told a briefing that "true reforms in the Russian 
economy have not begun yet" and that the presidential decrees 
will help to initiate them. 
  One of the documents instructs the government to submit a 
lawbill to parliament which will decrease the major taxes by 
10-20 per cent, including the VAT and profit tax, and grant an 
easy taxation regime to joint ventures engaged in production. 
The total number of taxes is also to be decreased. 
  Another decree abolishes the system of quoting and licensing 
exports which Livshits called "an atavism of socialist economy". 
Privileges in import duties are also cancelled. 
  Besides, Yeltsin ordered enterprises to pay their debts to 
each other and wages to employees by converting finances on 
their hard currency accounts. The absence of circulating assets 
can no longer be used as an explanation for non-payments. 
  Another decree obliges all legal entities to register with 
taxation services before opening bank accounts. Otherwise they 
will be fined and then closed. 
  "Now the government has a normative base to boost reforms, a 
base which, regrettably, the parliament does not hurry to 
provide. The government has to initiate a concrete programme of 
actions", Livshits said.
