FT  07 APR 92 / Arts: Today's Television
Judging from the output of television drama departments, you might imagine
that the only two spheres of human activity where people came into contact
with life and death matters were crime and medicine. Tuesdays are now
bringing us yet another detective series, Resnick: Lonely Hearts (10.00
BBC1) and yet another hospital series, Medics (9.00 ITV). Predictably
Resnick is yet another 'unconventional' policeman: lives on gherkin and
mustard sandwiches, listens to trad jazz, and sees ghosts.
The new series of Medics is nothing like the pilot last year: instead of
young housemen bedding one another we now have Tom Baker doing his familiar
manic grin over a surgeon's mask.
One day perhaps, drama departments will discover that life also occurs on
farms, in shops, at sea, and elsewhere.
Life in Hackney is much in the news: last night brought a programme about
policing the London borough and today 40 Minutes reports on efforts being
made by Hackney Council to evict squatters. The idea is to let the
properties and save nearly Pounds 6m a year from the costs of keeping people
in bed and breakfast accommodation.
