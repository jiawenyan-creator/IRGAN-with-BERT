SEAU WINS PAC-10 DEFENSIVE AWARD 
USC linebacker Junior Seau and running back Steve Broussard of Washington State 
have been named Pacific 10 defensive and offensive players of the year, and 
Oregon State's Dave Kragthorpe has been named Pac-10 coach of the year. 
Seau, a junior from Oceanside, helped USC's defense lead the nation in rushing 
defense, allowing 61.5 yards a game. Seau led the Pac-10 along with teammate 
Tim Ryan in tackles for losses with 25 for 137 yards, including 18 sacks. 
Broussard, a senior from Los Angeles, was second in the conference in rushing 
with 1,237 yards in 260 carries and 13 touchdowns. A former standout at Manual 
Arts, Broussard also led the Pac-10 in all-purpose yardage with 1,790, and in 
scoring with 17 touchdowns. 
Kragthorpe has led the Beavers to a 3-4-1 conference record with a game to 
play. The three conference victories are the most since 1974 for Oregon State, 
4-6-1 overall. Voting was done by the conference coaches.
