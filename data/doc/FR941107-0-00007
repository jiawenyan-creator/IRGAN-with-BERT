SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 927 [7 CFR Part 927] regulating the handling of winter
pears grown in Oregon, Washington, and California. The agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. 



The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, winter pears grown in Oregon, Washington, and California are subject to assessments. It is intended
that the assessment rate specified herein will be applicable to all assessable pears handled during the 199495
fiscal year, which began July 1, 1994, and ends 
June 30, 1995. This final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.
