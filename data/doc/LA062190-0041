METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUILDING DESTROYED BY FIRE STARTED IN 
DUMPSTER 
Torrance police continued their search Wednesday for a suspected arsonist who 
started a fire that destroyed a two-story building in old downtown early 
Tuesday. 
The blaze, which caused an estimated $1 million in losses, gutted the Value
