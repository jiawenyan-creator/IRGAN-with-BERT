  [Text] Johannesburg March 31 SAPA -- Minister of Justice 
and Defence Mr Kobie Coetsee on Friday [1 April] appointed South 
African Police Regional Commissioner of Natal Lt-Gen W H Steyn 
and Brig D Ferreira, commanding officer of Natal command, as 
joint control officers of Natal, including kwaZulu. The 
appointments were temporary, he said in a statement. 
  Mr Coetsee announced that the decision to appoint the two 
men 
was taken in consultation with the management committee of the 
Transitional Executive Council. 
  The appointments follow the imposition of a state of 
emergency in kwaZulu/Natal by State President F W de Klerk. 
  At a press briefing in Pretoria on Thursday, Mr de Klerk 
said 
large numbers of SADF [South African Defense Force] troops would 
be sent into the province to stabilise the region. 
  The emergency measures would not affect Mr Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi's position as chief minister of kwaZulu or his 
administration. 
  Similarly, dignified and full recognition should be given to 
the position of the Zulu monarch King Goodwill Zwelithini. 
  Mr de Klerk said emergency regulations would provide for the 
detention of people, a form of prohibition on the carrying of 
weapons and stricter controls on public events.
