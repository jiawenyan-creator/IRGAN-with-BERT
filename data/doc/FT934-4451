FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Hanson shares tumble 15 3/4p
Shares in Hanson tumbled 15 3/4p to 268 1/2p yesterday as investors took to
heart the cautious tone of the statement - including a warning there could
be Pounds 275m negative swing in interest costs in 1994 - and the lack of a
dividend increase.
Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said the holding of the dividend had been
a particularly difficult decision, and he thought it the first time in the
group's 30 year history that it had not been increased when final results
were announced.
He admitted being conscious that Hanson was a yield stock, but said with
dividend cover at 1.3 times, the earnings outlook dull in the short term,
and the Peabody coal strike still unresolved, Hanson had felt unable to
increase the dividend.
However, he said the issue would be under constant review, and hoped that as
trading turned up, and subject to the outlook for 1995, an increase might be
forthcoming later in 1994. Hanson pays dividends quarterly.
He doubted whether the Foreign Income Dividend scheme, detailed in the
Budget, would be beneficial to Hanson. 'We must satisfy all our
shareholders. FIDs are a massive turn-off for tax exempt investors.'
Mr Bill Landuyt, finance director, said the corporation tax provisions in
the Budget would have little effect on Hanson, and the group would 'look for
every legal way to reduce tax'. The 11p increase in duty on 20 cigarettes
would be harmful to volumes at Imperial Tobacco, while cuts in the road
building programme would affect ARC.
Group turnover in the year to September 30 was Pounds 9.76bn (Pounds 8.8bn)
and operating profits fell from Pounds 1.07bn to Pounds 978m, affected by
the Pounds 125m cost of the US coal strike but a Pounds 87m benefit from
exchange rate moves. Exceptionals, profits on disposals less closure costs,
added Pounds 24m (Pounds 172m).
Lower rates cut net interest income from Pounds 46m to Pounds 14m, leaving
pre-tax profits at Pounds 1.02bn (Pounds 1.29bn). The fall in UK interest
rates, the lack of high yielding long-term deposits fixed in 1992 and higher
borrowings due to acquisitions, could add Pounds 275m to interest charges in
1994.
Earnings, excluding exceptionals, were 14.1p (18.5p).
A fall in operating profits from industrial activities to Pounds 291m
(Pounds 393m) was not quite offset by a rise from Pounds 390m to Pounds 443m
in consumer products and from Pounds 257m to Pounds 301m in building
products.
