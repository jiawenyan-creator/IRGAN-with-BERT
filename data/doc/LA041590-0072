SCHOOL NEWS: ARROYO HIGH INSTALLS NEW MESSAGE BOARD 
Arroyo High School in El Monte has installed a new message board west of the 
district field facing Santa Anita Avenue. 
The sign announces club meetings, athletic endeavors, and school events and 
reunions. 
The old board was destroyed during a severe windstorm two years ago. The new 
board can be programmed in the office of Nick Salerno, assistant principal for 
activities.
