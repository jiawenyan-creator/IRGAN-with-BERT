FT  28 DEC 94 / Guinness appeal timing defended
The Home Office last night defended the timing of its decision to refer the
case of the four original defendants in the Guinness trial to the Court of
Appeal.
It refused to confirm or deny a report in The Times newspaper that the
decision was taken by Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, 72 hours after
legal proceedings demanding a judicial review were initiated against him by
Lord Mishcon, acting for Mr Gerald Ronson.
The report said the proceedings were started because Mr Howard had failed to
reach a decision on the application after 22 months.
The Home Office said: 'The decision was taken on a very complex case after
very careful consideration. The timing had to do with the need to give this
careful consideration.'
