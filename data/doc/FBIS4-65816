  [Text] "Italy will have to be present in any decisionmaking 
group concerning it. It is unacceptable that it is not in the 
contact group on Bosnia," [Foreign Minister Antonio] Martino 
said in Washington. 
  Tomorrow he will tell the U.S. secretary of state about the 
"continuity" of Italian foreign policy provided there is "a 
correct relationship with the allies." 
  "We consider that leaving out Italy from the enlargement of 
the UN Security Council to 10 members would be an unacceptable 
exclusion," he said. 
  He said that the Treaty of Osimo is "fully valid." 
  On Istria and Dalmatia, he said: "We have no requests to 
make."
