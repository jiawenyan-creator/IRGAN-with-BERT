FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Reflex shares are left for the overwriters
While underwriters are being forced to buy up shares left in flotations and
rights issues, Butler &amp; Briscoe, the Dublin stockbrokers, proved the value
of 'overwriters' when a tender offer for shares in Reflex Investments, an
Irish computer company, found no response.
The term overwriters describes people who guarantee to sell shares rather
than buy them. But unlike underwriters, the Reflex overwriters did not get
paid a commission.
Reflex, a loss-making computer leasing group which is transforming itself
into a software company, persuaded Mr Martin Anthony Kilduff to come in as
chairman. Mr Kilduff has won a reputation as a computer wizard after
building up Kindle, his own software group, and selling out to ACT.
Mr Kilduff bought a 5.2 per cent stake in Reflex in May, at prices of about
18p, but wanted to raise this to 29.9 per cent before he would take the
chair.
Earlier this month Reflex agreed to place 780,000 new shares with him and he
launched the tender offer to buy another 3.4m shares, all at 13 1/2 p  -
well below the market price.
Yesterday Butler &amp; Briscoe announced that no shareholders had taken
advantage of the tender. As a result a group of shareholders which had
agreed to overwrite the tender were called on to supply the stock. Reflex
shares were yesterday quoted at 25p.
