BAUER'S REMARKS 
Steven Bauer, an actor of Cuban origin, is suddenly an expert on 
Mexican-American relations. In Bart Mills' June 19 article, " 'Desperados' 
Relives the Brutal Murder of a U.S. Drug Agent," Bauer stated that the Mexican 
people "don't like us; they really don't." Also that Mexicans want to make our 
country "look stupid, which is what Mexicans live for." 
Funny, but I get different vibes. On the whole the Mexican people admire and 
respect our political system and our immense wealth and power. Many certainly 
want to live here! When they compare their corrupt government, ballot box fraud 
and other social ills with mainstream America, we come out smelling like a 
rose.
