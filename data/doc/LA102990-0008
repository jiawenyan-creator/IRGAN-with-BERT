INSURANCE COMMISSIONER 
Your editorial makes a good case for voting for Bannister. But another issue 
comes through loud and clear. 
Garamendi has been in Sacramento for 16 years. He has run for governor and 
state controller. And he's going to continue to try for various public offices 
until he gets into one in which he is incompetent. (The Peter Principle at 
work.) He's part of the problem, not the solution. He's got the political and 
fund-raising connections to trample an unknown like Bannister no matter how 
well-qualified for office the latter individual may be. 
Garamendi is an example of why we need term limitations. Holding public office 
should not be a lifetime career.
