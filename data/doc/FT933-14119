FT  15 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Europe and Middle East edge into lead
Performance in European and Middle Eastern emerging markets edged ahead of
Latin America last month, according to data supplied by the IFC, a part of
the World Bank.
Over the year so far, the former are even more impressive: up by nearly 60
per cent in dollar terms compared with a 5 per cent rise in Latin America
and Asia's 14 per cent.
Most of the gain in Europe/Middle East can be attributed to Turkey's
startling rally since January: in spite of weakness over the last week, the
market remains more than 100 per cent up on the year.
Within this region, Portugal has shown a reasonable advance over the year
although, as Baring Securities notes in a recent research document, the
market has been a disappointing performer since the Gulf war.
The broker comments that an overhaul of the market's structure since 1992 -
including the introduction of continuous trading and the establishment of a
central clearing house - has stimulated overseas interest.
Baring puts this together with falling interest rates and the devaluation of
the escudo, and forecasts a 'strong upside for equities over the next couple
of years'.
Mexico, which has lagged behind many of the world's emerging markets this
year, attracted the attention of Nomura this week. The global strategy team
recommends a switch of funds from France to Mexico, arguing that the
latter's upside potential seems more promising over the next six months.
