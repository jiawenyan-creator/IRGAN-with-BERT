FT  19 MAR 94 / FT Round the World Ski Expedition
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. This week, they moved from North America to
Europe. Arnie writes:
We arrived in up-state New York to enjoy the Catskills ski areas: Belleayre
was fun, but we had been warned that Hunter Mountain would be 'a zoo' on a
Saturday. We were pleasantly surprised - no-one mugged us or offered us
drugs. Perhaps the armed security men helped.
We wanted to ski Cortina and Davos (the US versions) in preparation for
Europe, but only Cortina was open.
Then we lingered too long at genteel Windham, skiing a few runs with the
Austrian ski school director Franz Kirkl, and completed our 25th Everest (in
terms of vertical feet skied) in North America. Things got worse when we
became lost in New York and only caught the flight to Europe by the skin of
our teeth.
There is still time to win a skiing holiday in Courmayeur, or ski equipment,
by entering the competition which appeared in Weekend FT on March 5 (copies
