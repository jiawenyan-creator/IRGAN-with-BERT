FT  10 JUL 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Visual link provides
communication line
Providing a voice and data telecommunications link between an office block
and a factory site on opposite sides of a city can be expensive if it relies
on leased lines.
But as long as there is a line of sight between the two buildings, GPT
Communication Systems has an innovative cost effective alternative called
Blacklite.
By using very high frequency (millimetric) radio technology, previously used
only for military communications, Blacklite can provide a low cost, high
speed alternative to the costly leased line services offered by public
network operators.
The system, built around a pair of video-camera sized transmitter/receivers
called external radio modules (ERMs) which would normally be sited on the
roof, costs about Pounds 20,000, and supports as many as 120 simultaneous
voice or data 'conversations' between sites up to 18km apart.
