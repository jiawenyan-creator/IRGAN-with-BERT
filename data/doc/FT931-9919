FT  11 FEB 93 / Docklands to be council's base
TOWER HAMLETS Council is moving its headquarters to a new building at East
India Dock in the London Docklands.
The council has signed a 10-year lease on the 140,000 sq ft building which
is jointly owned by NCC, a Swedish construction group, and Trygg-Hansa SPP,
Sweden's largest insurance and pensions group.
This is the first letting at the East India Dock development, which consists
of four buildings totalling 600,000 sq ft.
About 800 staff who work in eight buildings scattered around the borough
will move to the new headquarters in the summer. The council estimates that
the move will save it about Pounds 6m over the next 10 years.
The council said the move was linked to a structural reorganisation due in
April.
The East India Dock building will house the council chamber as well as its
engineering, finance, personnel and strategic services. Most of the other
services are now based in seven local centres.
Last summer the council shortlisted seven Docklands developments, including
Canary Wharf, for its new town hall.
