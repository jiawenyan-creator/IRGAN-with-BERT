The Customs Service shall assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between
U.S. price and foreign market value may vary from the percentage stated above. The Department will issue appraisement
instructions concerning the respondent directly to the U.S. Customs Service.

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise,
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of these amended final results
of administrative review, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act): (1)
The cash deposit rate for the reviewed firm will be 10.18%; and (2) the cash deposit rate for merchandise exported by
all other manufacturers and exporters who are not covered by this review will be the ``all others'' rate of 98.60 percent
established in the less-than-fair-value investigation, in accordance with 

Floral Trade Council

 v. 

United States

, 822 F.Supp. 766 (1993), and 

Federal Mogul Corporation

, 822 F.Supp. 782 (1993).

These deposit requirements shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative
review.

This notice serves as the final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibility
concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d).
Timely written notification or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with
the regulations and the terms of the APO is a sanctionable violation.

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(f) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673(d)) and 19 CFR
353.28(c).
