FT  11 JUL 92 / International Company News: More top dismissals at Hafnia
THREE SENIOR executives of a subsidiary of the Hafnia insurance group were
dismissed yesterday after management had discovered fresh irregularities.
Hafnia, Denmark's second largest insurance group, has teetered on the brink
of collapse for the past two weeks following steep declines in the value of
its strategic shareholdings in domestic rival Baltica and Swedish insurance
company Skandia.
A week ago a group deputy general manager was dismissed when he was found to
have committed the group to share transactions, of which the board was not
aware, causing a loss of DKr350m (Dollars 60.2m).
Yesterday the group dismissed three managers at Hafnia Trust &amp; Investment
Bank when it found that they had failed to report shareholdings of more than
5 per cent in four listed companies to the stock exchange, thus ignoring
disclosure legislation.
On Thursday Hafnia Holding, the parent company, reported shareholdings in
six listed companies to the stock exchange which had not previously been
disclosed.
Hafnia also reported that its 1991 published losses of DKr1.2bn were
improperly reduced when a block of shares was sold at a price above stock
market value. The share transaction reduced the year's loss by around
DKr200m.
Despite these disclosures, institutional investors have agreed to guarantee
a rights share issue raising DKr2bn for Hafnia. The issue was launched this
week. The group's banks have also agreed to meet its liquidity requirements.
On July 2, the group reported that its equity capital was negative, but in
yesterday's statement to the stock exchange it said that no new transactions
requiring additional loss provisions have been found.
