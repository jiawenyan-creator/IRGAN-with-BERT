  [Text] UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola] has stepped up its shelling of the city of Kuito and 
outlaying areas. Several people have either been killed or 
wounded. Clashes between government and UNITA troops have also 
been reported. The situation has been worsened by an 
unprecedented shortage of food. An average of 10 people starve 
to death in Kuito daily. Thousands of undernourished people 
could have the same fate in the next few days unless relief 
operations resume. 
  Meanwhile, UNITA continues to move men, including Zairian 
mercenaries, and war materiel to mount a large-scale offensive 
on the city of N'dalatando over the next few hours. Lieutenant 
General Manuel Jose Neco, commander of the Cuanza Norte 
Operational Area, says government forces continue to defend the 
city. UNITA's long-range artillery units are still shelling the 
city. Government forces have killed eight UNITA soldiers and 
captured assorted war materiel. Captured UNITA soldiers 
disclosed that Jonas Savimbi instructed Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola commando units from Huambo to retake the 
city of N'dalatando before the end of the month to further 
complicate the Lusaka peace talks.
