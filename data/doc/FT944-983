FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T close to Dollars 50m
purchase of Ziff arm
AT&amp;T is reported to be close to agreeing to pay about Dollars 50m for the
on-line computer service being developed by Ziff Communications.
Although neither AT&amp;T nor Ziff would comment on the reports, sources close
to the negotiations said the deal could be completed before the end of the
year.
If the transaction went ahead, it would provide AT&amp;T with an important entry
into the rapidly expanding market for on-line computer services. It would
also complete the dismantling of the Ziff family's publishing empire.
AT&amp;T, with its large customer base from its core telephone business, hopes
to play a central role in the development of interactive telecommunications
in the US.
Although Ziff's Interchange Online Network is not expected to be ready until
next year, the service will enable users to exploit the latest multimedia
computer technology - a significant advantage over the older on-line
services provided by established companies such as CompuServe, Prodigy and
America Online.
AT&amp;T will face intense competition in the on-line computer services
business. In addition to the well-established services, it will soon face
competition from software group Microsoft, which in November announced plans
to launch an on-line service.
Microsoft said it would spend heavily on developing a service that would
provide a wide range of on-line information, products and services to users
through partnerships with telephone companies, publishers and entertainment
groups.
