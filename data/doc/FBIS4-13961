  [Text] On 10 April a delegation of Golboddin's party, led 
by [word indistinct] Arghandiwal, head of the party's finances, 
visited Moscow. [Words indistinct] in an article with the 
headline: War Equipments for Hekmatyar, wrote that the purpose 
of the visit, which was [words indistinct] of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, was ostensibly about the return of seven 
Soviet prisoners of war who are with the armed groups of 
Golboddin. However, the real goal of the delegation was talks 
about the purchase of more weapons and ammunition from Russia. 
  It is reported that this week a group of Afghan Mojahedin 
has 
issued a statement, a section of which says: Russian military 
aid to antistate forces inflames the fire of fighting which has 
been ongoing since the new year. As Golboddin and General 
Dostum have started armed clashes to seize power in Afghanistan, 
a large number of people are of the opinion that the arms and 
ammunition that Golboddin buys from Russia do not stay in 
Afghanistan, but are exported to other parts of the world.
