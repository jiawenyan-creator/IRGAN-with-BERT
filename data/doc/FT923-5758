FT  28 AUG 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Cables stand up to the strain
American Superconductor has announced an advance in the quest for
superconducting transmission lines, that can conduct electricity with little
energy loss.
The Watertown, Massachusetts company has produced prototype multi-stranded
conductors that can withstand the rigours of bending and strain that would
be faced in commercial use. Previous prototype cables degraded when the
cables were bent or coiled.
Special characteristics of the wires making up the cable provide resistance
to strain. Each wire is a composite of up to 10,000 internal filaments -
microscopic superconducting elements- which run through the wire.
In addition to saving energy, superconducting cables promise to enable
electrical utilities companies to transmit larger amounts of electricity
than on conventional cables, providing big cost and performance
improvements. American Superconductor: US, 617 923 1122.
