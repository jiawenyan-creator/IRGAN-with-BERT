THE SIDELINES; 
MUDD CAN'T DEFEND CLASSIC TITLE 
An ailing back forced defending champion Jodie Mudd to withdraw from the 
$1-million Byron Nelson Classic, which is to begin Thursday. 
Mudd told tournament officials by telephone today that his back has not 
responded to treatment. 
Mudd, winner of the Players Championship earlier this season, also withdrew 
from a PGA Tour event in New Orleans last week.
