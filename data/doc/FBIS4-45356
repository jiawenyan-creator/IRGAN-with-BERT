  [Text] Mexico City, 6 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- A light plane from 
Colombia, which was loaded with 800 kg of cocaine, was captured 
in Chetumal, southeastern Mexico, the Attorney General's Office 
[PGR] has reported. 
  The PGR reported the death of three members of the Federal 
Judicial Police [PJF] and the pilot of a helicopter, which was 
used to pursue the individuals who were awaiting the light 
plane's arrival. A PGR communique added that the PJF and the 
National Counternarcotics Institute (Incd) captured the aircraft 
in Chetumal, capital of the southeastern State of Quintana Roo. 
The document pointed out that Incd radars detected the Turbo 
Commander with registration no. N520QS from Colombia before it 
entered Mexican airspace. 
  The PGR carried out an operation involving helicopters and 
planes that led to the capture of the aircraft and three 
vehicles that were going to transport the drug to its 
destination.
