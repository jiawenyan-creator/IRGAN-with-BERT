  [Text] Prishtina, April 20 (ATA) -- The Serb Government is 
closing down the private shops of Albanians because they do not 
want to change the inscriptions in Albanian language on their 
shops. Serbs have demanded from them to put the inscriptions in 
the Cyrillic alphabet. They also want to change the name of 
Ferizaj to Uroshevac, which is a Serb name.
