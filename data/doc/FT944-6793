FT  28 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): Seeboard - Other Companies
The company will kick off what is expected to be a controversial interims
season for the England and Wales regional electricity companies when it
reports on Thursday. Profit figures for the first half of the year are
always of limited significance but the recs' dividend rises always provoke
criticism. Seeboard is expected to be relatively restrained, with analysts
forecasting rises of about 16 per cent. However some of its peers are likely
to go beyond 20 per cent. The Labour Party seems bound to renew calls for a
windfall tax on utilities.
