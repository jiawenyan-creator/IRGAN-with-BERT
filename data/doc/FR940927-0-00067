 

Accordingly, the Director approves the proposed amendment.


1. Nonsubstantive Revisions to Utah's Coal Mining Rules



Utah proposed revisions to the following previously approved rules that are nonsubstantive in nature and consist
of minor editorial or grammatical changes (the corresponding Federal regulation provisions are listed in parentheses):



Utah Admin. R. 645201323.100 (30 CFR 772.12(b)(8)(iv)), narrative description of the proposed exploration
area, and 

Utah Admin. R. 645201342.200 (30 CFR 772.12(d)(2)(ii)), approval or disapproval of an application
for a major coal exploration permit.




Because the proposed revisions to these previously approved rules are nonsubstantive in nature, the Director finds
that the proposed Utah rules are no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations. The Director approves
these proposed rules.



2. Substantive Revisions to Utah's Coal Mining Rules That Are Substantially Identical to the Corresponding Provisions
of the Federal Regulations



Utah proposed revisions to the following rules that are substantive in nature and contain language that is substantially
identical to the requirements of the corresponding Federal regulation provisions (listed in parentheses):




Utah Admin. R. 645200121 (30 CFR 772.1), coal exploration which is subject to 43 CFR parts 3480 through
3487,
Utah Admin. R. 645201200 through 220 (30 CFR 772.11), notices of intention to conduct minor coal exploration,

Utah Admin. R. 645202100 (30 CFR 815.13), required documents,
Utah Admin. R. 645202232 (30 CFR 815.15(b)), performance standards for roads or other transportation
facilities used for coal exploration, and 
 
Utah Admin. R. 645202235 (30 CFR 815.15(i), performance standards which minimize disturbance of the
hydrologic balance.




Because these proposed Utah rules are substantially identical to the corresponding provisons of the Federal regulations,
the Director finds that they are no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director approves these proposed
rules.



3. Utah Admin. R. 645200122, R. 645200123, 645201223, and 645201310,
Coal Exploration in Relation to an Approved Permit Area



Utah proposed that its rules at Utah Admin. R. 645200122, 645200123, 645201223,
and 645201310 setting forth the scope of Utah's coal exploration rules, would apply to ``coal exploration''
instead of coal exploration that occurs ``outside an approved permit area'' or coal exploration that occurs'' ``in
relation to an approved permit area.''

The corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 772.11, for coal exploration operations removing 250 tons or less
of coal, and at 30 CFR 772.12, for coal exploration operations removing more than 250 tons of coal, apply to coal exploration
conducted ``outside a permit area.'' In promulgating this language, OSM explained in the preamble for these Federal
regulations that a coal exploration permit is not appropriate for coal exploration on lands covered by a surface coal
mining permit because exploration within the permit area should have been planned as an integral part of the surface
coal mining and reclamation operations (44 FR 14901, 150178; March 13, 1979). The effect of these Federal regulations
is that, for proposed coal exploration within the permit area, the State regulatory authority would review and approve,
as appropriate, the proposed coal exploration in conjunction with the review and approval of a permit application,
and for coal exploration outside the permit area, would review and approve the proposed coal exploration pursuant
to the appropriate rules for coal exploration.


Utah's proposed deletions of the phrases concerning approved permit areas are consistent with OSM's regulations
and the rationale for them in the preamble to the Federal regulations. Therefore, the Director finds that Utah's proposed
revisions to Utah Amin. R. 645200122, 645200123, 645201223, and 645201310
are no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 772.11 and 772.12. The Director approves
these proposed rules.





4. Utah Admin. R. 645200220, 645200230, and 645201100 through 645201130,
Responsibilities of the Division and Coal Exploration Plan Review



Utah proposed revisions to its rules at (1) Utah Admin. R. 645200220 to provide that it is the Division's
responsibility to review and enforce the terms of each notice of intention to conduct coal exploration; (2) Utah Amin.
R. 645200230 to provide that it is the Division's responsibility to review and approve or disapprove
major coal exploration applications and issue, condition, suspend, revoke, and enforce major coal exploration
permits and coordinate with other government agencies; and (3) Utah Admin. R. 645201100 through 645201130
to provide that it is the Division's responsibility to review coal exploration plans on lands which are not subject
to the requirements of 43 CFR 3480 through 3487, and to provide that, on lands [Federal lands] where the requirements
of 43 CFR 3480 through 3487 apply, the review of coal exploration plans will be guided by the appropriate part of 43 CFR.

The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 772 establish the requirements and procedures applicable to coal exploration
operations on all lands except for Federal lands subject to the requirements of 43 CFR parts 3480 through 3487. The
Federal regulations at 43 CFR 3480 through 3487 pertain to operations for the exploration, development, and production
of Federal coal under Federal coal leases, licenses, and permits, regardless of surface ownership, pursuant to the
Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, as amended (30 U.S.C. 181, 

et seq.

). The responsibility for administration of the Mineral Leasing Act is vested with the Bureau of Land Management.
