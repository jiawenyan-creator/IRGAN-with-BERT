FT  29 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Uncertain political
outlook leaves Nikkei edging lower
TRADING remained subdued by continuing political uncertainty, and share
prices were finally marginally lower after trading within a tight range,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 61.81 at 19,829.58 after a day's low of 19,792.68
and high of 19,958.00. With buying by public pension funds and investment
trusts absent, the index lost ground in tandem with the futures market.
Volume amounted to 180m shares, against Tuesday's 200m. Declines outnumbered
advances by 513 to 432, with 192 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks shed 3.17 to 1,622.28. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index rose 1.32 to 1,231.85.
Traders feared that investors would remain inactive, using the political
situation as an excuse. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said: 'Even after
a new prime minister is chosen, investors may not want to trade until
policies are made by the cabinet.'
Investors have reacted calmly to the likelihood of a non-Liberal Democratic
Party coalition gaining power. The two splinter parties yesterday decided to
join the coalition formed by the five remaining opposition parties, giving
the opposition side a majority. Market participants are also focusing on the
next LDP president, who will be chosen tomorrow.
Some banks lost ground on profit-taking. Sakura Bank receded Y20 to Y1,640
and Fuji Bank lost Y20 to Y2,480. Brokers were also easier on fears of lower
profits due to the sharp fall in recent market volume. Daiwa Securities
weakened Y40 to Y1,280 and Nikko Securities shed Y20 to Y1,080.
Nomura Securities retreated Y20 to Y2,010. Investors were discouraged by
reports that it would bail out an ailing non-bank financial subsidiary.
Speculators took profits in Nikkatsu, the most active issue of the day,
which relinquished Y1 to Y16.
Game makers firmed on hopes that new software would boost profits. Sega
Enterprises rose Y400 to Y10,700 and Namco Y140 to Y3,690.
Nippon Kayaku, a chemical maker, moved up Y5 to Y889 as investors were
encouraged by reports that the renovation of Sumitomo Chemical's epoxy resin
plant, which exploded earlier this month, would take longer than expected.
Sumitomo dipped Y5 to Y450 on expectations of a lower market share.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 21.33 to 21,926.24 in volume of 13.8m
shares. Nintendo rose Y330 to Y9,580.
