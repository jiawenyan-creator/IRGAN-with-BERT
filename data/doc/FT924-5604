FT  26 NOV 92 / W. German industry plans more production cuts
West German industry is planning more production cuts after a further fall
in new orders during October, the Ifo economics institute in Munich said
yesterday, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt. Business conditions again
worsened and manufacturers had become even more pessimistic, a monthly
survey said.
A modest reduction in west German inflation from 3.7 per cent in October is
widely expected to be followed by further rises.
