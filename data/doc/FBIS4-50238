  [Text] Lhasa, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- Three years after two 
projects of the first-phase comprehensive program for 
agricultural development were started in Tibet's Pengbo and 
Aimagang areas, construction of the second-phase program -- 
three projects in Lhunzhub county's Pengbo, Bainang county's 
Duqiong, and Gonggar county's Qiongjie -- has been under way 
since the beginning of this year. 
  The second-phase program includes water conservancy, 
forestry, transportation, and energy development projects. It 
is expected that a total of 27.5 million yuan will be invested 
this year, of which 15 million will come from the central 
government. Under the second-phase program, the three projects 
will be built into model farms which have comprehensive 
irrigation facilities and can yield comprehensive results. In 
these model farms there will be fields and gardens; planting 
will be carried in planned zones; farming will be mechanized; 
fine seed strains will be used; and management will be conducted 
in a scientific way. 
  In the past three years since the first-phase program 
started 
at Pengbo and Aimagang, a good situation has emerged in 
development and construction. In these two comprehensive 
agricultural development zones, good-quality water conservancy 
projects have been built; the survival rate of planted trees has 
been high; marked achievements have been made in the 
transformation of medium- and low-yielding farms and in building 
of grasslands; and initial results have been made in improving 
the conditions for agricultural production. Production capacity 
in the two zones has increased to some extent. By the end of 
last year, 48,000 mu of medium- and low-yielding farms had been 
transformed, 43,600 mu of grassland planted with new grass or 
improved, and 15,000 mu of land afforested. This represents 85 
percent of the tasks assigned by the state in the three years.
