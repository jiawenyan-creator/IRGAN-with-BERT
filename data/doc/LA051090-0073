CHIEF DEFENDS CHICO OFFICERS IN QUELLING RIOT 
Four people have filed complaints that police used excessive force to quell a 
drunken rampage by 1,000 beer-swilling youths last weekend, Police Chief John 
Bullerjahn said Wednesday. 
Bullerjahn said police will investigate the complaints, but declined to discuss 
details of the incidents. 
He blamed the riot squarely on the 94 people arrested during the two-day clash 
that marred the city's annual spring celebration, Rancho Chico Days. 
"The only people to blame for this are those who were arrested," Bullerjahn 
told reporters at a news conference. "I think the community ought to be proud 
of the way the incident was handled. 
There were 38 police officers injured in the melee, most by rocks and bottles 
as they tried to disperse the crowd. One officer suffered a broken leg. 
Butte County Dist. Atty. Mike Ramsey said he had seen no evidence of police 
brutality, but would "certainly look at that issue, just like we would at any 
other."
