FT  09 FEB 93 / Russian privatisation gathers pace
RUSSIA stepped up the pace of its ambitious privatisation programme
yesterday with sales of shares in the historic GUM department store in
Moscow and factories in the industrial city of Volgograd, formerly
Stalingrad.
Nearly 6,000 individual investors or investment funds expressed interest in
buying shares in GUM, according to Mr Yuri Samonov, a member of the GUM
board. About 15.5 per cent of the store was offered for sale in the past two
weeks; two-thirds of its shares are already in private hands.
In Volgograd, enterprises being sold include a tractor plant, a margarine
factory, and an aluminium plant.
