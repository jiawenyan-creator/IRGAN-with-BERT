FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: TT&amp;T valued at Dollars 3.4bn on
first day's trading
Thai Telephone and Telecommunication, the consortium installing 1m new
telephone lines in Thailand's provinces, was valued at Dollars 3.4bn when
its shares were traded on the local stock exchange for the first time
yesterday.
After opening at Bt190, against an initial public offering price of Bt145,
the shares fell along with the rest of the market and closed at Bt171.
TT&amp;T is the fourth-largest company by capitalisation on the Stock Exchange
of Thailand, after TelecomAsia (which is installing 2m new lines in the
capital) Bangkok Bank and Siam Cement.
After years of inadequate investment by state telephone companies, work by
TT&amp;T will more than double the number of provincial telephone lines, and it
is expected to benefit from rapid economic growth.
