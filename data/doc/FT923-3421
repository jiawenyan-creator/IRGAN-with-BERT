FT  12 SEP 92 / Letter: Green shoots?
Sir, In recent years there have been significant changes in our industrial
towns and cities. Many factories, mills and warehouses have been demolished
and there has been a huge increase in the number of supermarkets and
out-of-town superstores. As the government now appears to measure the
nation's financial health by the amount of cash going through the till, are
the green shoots of recovery just round the corner?
