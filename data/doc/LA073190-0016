VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: POINT MUGU; 
LIFEGUARD STRUCK ON BIKE OUTING, KILLED 
A Point Mugu lifeguard who was also recreation director for a Thousand Oaks 
retirement home was killed on Pacific Coast Highway Sunday morning while riding 
her bike to Oxnard with friends, authorities said. 
Tracy Clarke, 26, of Malibu was pronounced dead at Westlake Community Hospital 
about 8 a.m., said Officer Ed McLaughlin of the California Highway Patrol. 
Dantio Herrera, whose Datsun swerved into the bike lane and struck Clarke from 
behind, was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter and drunk driving. 
The 20-year-old Los Angeles man was being held at the Los Angeles County 
sheriff's station at Malibu in lieu of $100,000 bail, McLaughlin said. 
McLaughlin said Herrera attempted to flee the collision, about half a mile west 
of Decker Canyon Road in Malibu, but Clarke's bike caught under his car and 
stopped him. 
Clarke was thrown about 80 feet from her bike. 
Clarke worked as a lifeguard for the state Parks and Recreation Department and 
as recreation director for Castle Hill Retirement Village, according to a 
friend, John Weatherly. 
She was training for a triathlon in Canada next month, Weatherly said. KIRSTEN
