FT  09 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
STOCK INDEX futures powered ahead to reach record levels in busy trading
which saw the June contract on the FT-SE trade at a premium through out the
session, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 2,733, a squeeze in June developed within the first hour as
dealers rushed to cover short positions. The squeeze sent June soaring and
at the day's best a premium of 47 points to the underlying cash market was
recorded. The day's high of 2,672 was reached at around 1.30pm.
The market witnessed some large trades particularly from the big investment
houses such as James Capel in the dying minutes of the session.
June eventually closed at 2,766, a record high and up 25 on the previous
session, and around 23 points above its estimated premium to cash of about
18.
The LTOM also put in a strong performance with turnover reaching 40,896
contracts, with the FT-SE option recording a day's total of 11,372 lots.
Hanson, a strong feature in the equity market, was the day's top traded
stock option. It traded 2,898 lots with the August 240 calls the most
active. It was followed by British Gas, at 2,528. BP, Asda and Midland Bank
were also busy.
