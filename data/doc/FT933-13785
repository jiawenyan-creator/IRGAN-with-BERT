FT  17 JUL 93 / Improvement in May US trade figures
The US merchandise trade deficit fell to Dollars 8.4bn (Pounds 5.6bn) in
May, a significant improvement after deficits in excess of Dollars 10bn in
both March and April. Most analysts expected a deficit of more than Dollars
9bn.
The improvement, announced by the Commerce Department yesterday, partly
reflected a recovery in exports, which rose 1.2 per cent from April and 4.4
per cent in the year to May. Imports fell 2.8 per cent from exceptionally
high levels in March and April but remained 10.8 per cent higher than in May
last year.
The Federal Reserve said industrial output fell 0.2 per cent last month.
Revised May figures showed zero growth rather than the 0.2 per cent rise
first reported.
For the second quarter, production grew at an annual rate of 1.9 per cent,
sharply down from 5.5 per cent in the first quarter.
The weakness in production last month was broadly based, with declines in
output of consumer goods, construction supplies and mining. Manufacturing
output fell 0.3 per cent.
Consumer confidence continued to fall early this month, according to an
index compiled by the University of Michigan which fell to 76.9 early this
month compared with 81.5 in June.
The weakness in consumer confidence is believed partly to reflect
uncertainty about the outcome of congressional wrangling over the White
House deficit cutting economic plan. After upward revisions to retail sales,
real consumer spending is estimated to have grown at an annual rate of about
3per cent in the second quarter.
The latest figures point to growth of gross domestic product at an annual
rate of about 2 per cent in the second quarter, an improvement from growth
of less than 1 per cent in the first quarter.
