FT  20 NOV 92 / Warning on future of Post Office
THE GOVERNMENT'S current review of the Post Office and its future structure
should take full account of users' fears that a change of ownership might
imperil service and prices, the postal watchdog warns today.
In two reports sent to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
the Post Office Users National Council acknowledged that privatisation, with
appropriate regulatory safeguards, could provide greater freedom and
flexibility to manage, expand and finance the business.
But it argues that the government could provide the greater commercial
freedom that the business needed by keeping it under state ownership. The
option of privatisation was not essential.
Mr Tom Corrigan, council chairman, said it was important that big structural
changes, particularly disposals of any parts of the business, should proceed
only if it could be demonstrated that the present universal service would
not be prejudiced.
'This applies equally to Parcelforce, where the government has announced a
clear intention to privatise the business,' he said.
Mr Corrigan argued against 'ill-considered' change and said that the full
impli-cations, benefits and consequences of proposals for change must be
properly analysed, reviewed and presented objectively rather than
ideologically.
