FT  14 DEC 92 / Construction Contracts: Medway towns road relief scheme
EDMUND NUTTALL has won a highway infrastructure contract from English
Industrial Estates Corporation (English Estates) as part of its overall
Chatham Maritime development on the Medway in Kent.
The Pounds 6m project, officially entitled the Primary Highway Network
Contract, is a key element in the Medway towns northern relief road scheme
linking the commercial centres of Chatham, Gillingham and Rochester and
providing direct access to Chatham Maritime from the motorway network.
When completed, the scheme will provide a dual carriageway north-south link,
some 650 metres in length. Two roundabouts will serve existing developments
and open up further sites for development at Chatham Maritime. Central to
the scheme is a grade separated roundabout to link the Medway tunnel being
constructed to the west, with the Gillingham northern link road that will be
developed to the east.
Twin 22-metre span reinforced concrete bridges will carry the Primary
Highway across the tunnel approach cutting. This 125-metre-long trough is to
be excavated to a depth of 10 metres within piled walls.
Also included is a 0.2km dual carriageway western link road. Ancillary works
also include provision of a pumping station.
