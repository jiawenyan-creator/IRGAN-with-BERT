FT  21 JAN 92 / World Trade News: SAS may opt for jets from China venture
SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) plans to cancel firm orders for 10
McDonnell Douglas MD-80 airliners worth about Dollars 300m (Pounds 167.5m),
but could substitute these with the smaller MD-95 aircraft the US
manufacturer proposes building jointly with China, Paul Betts writes.
SAS said yesterday it was talking with McDonnell Douglas on cancelling 10 of
the 15 MD-80 airliners it had booked. SAS, which has suffered a passenger
traffic fall mainly in its home market because of the recession, says it no
longer needs the 10 MD-80 130-seat aircraft.
It wants smaller 90-100-seater aircraft to replace its fleet of 75-seat
McDonnell Douglas DC-9 airliners by the mid-1990s. It hopes to expand its
operations in an increasingly deregulated European market, Mr Kjell
Fredheim, chief operating officer, said.
SAS is discussing with McDonnell Douglas the possible substitution for the
10 MD-80s of an order for 15 MD-95s, the 90-100 seat derivative of the MD-90
twin-jet airliners, making it a launch customer for the MD-95 McDonnell
Douglas plans to co-produce with China. The US manufacturer hopes to
finalise a deal with Beijing soon. Under this, McDonnell Douglas would
co-produce in China about 170 aircraft by the year 2007.
SAS said yesterday it was also considering other choices such as the Fokker
100 and BAe 146 for its 100-seat aircraft needs. It wants the new
100-seaters by 1995-96.
