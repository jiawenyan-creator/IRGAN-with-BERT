Pesticide Tolerances for Avermectin B

1

 and its Delta-8,9-Isomer; Renewal of Tolerances 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to renew tolerances for the residues of the insecticide avermectin B

1

 and its delta-8,9-isomer in or on certain raw agricultural commodities and food and feed commodities. Merck 
Co., Inc., requested this proposal to renew the effective date for tolerances for maximum permissible levels of residues
of this insecticide in or on these commodities.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>

 Written comments, identified by the document control number [PP 7F3500, 8F3592, FAP 8H5650/P586) must be received
on or before September 2, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Agency issued a conditional registration for avermectin B

1

 for use on cotton on May 22, 1989, with an expiration date of March 31, 1992 (see the 

Federal Register

 of August 23, 1989 (54 FR 35059)). This conditional registration was amended on July 25, 1989, to include citrus (see
the 

Federal Register

 of August 2, 1989 (54 FR 31836)). On April 1, 1992, this expiration date was subsequently extended to April 30, 1995,
to allow the Agency sufficient time to review the data. The registrations were made conditional since certain data
were lacking and required by the Agency to allow it to evaluate the effects of avermectin B

1

 on fish and aquatic organisms. See the 

Federal Register

 of August 23, 1989 (54 FR 35059), for specific data requirements. Because of the lack of these data the tolerances on
cotton and citrus were established with an expiration date of March 31, 1993. 


On November 20, 1992, Merck  Co. requested a waiver of the aquatic field study (mesocosm study) due to a change
in Agency policy regarding the need for higher tiered fate and ecological effects data. In addition, Merck  Co.
agreed to implement interim risk reduction measures designed to reduce the potential for aquatic exposure from application
of avermectin B

1

 to cotton and citrus. The interim risk reduction measures included label changes aimed at reducing exposure to aquatic
organisms such as (1) reduction in the number of applications and total seasonal applications; (2) increase in retreatment
intervals; (3) geographic limitations; and (4) inclusion of aquatic buffer zones.
The Agency reexamined the existing ecological effects data base and concluded that it had sufficient baseline data
to characterize aquatic hazard for this pesticide. Thus, on January 10, 1993, the Agency waived the requirement for
a mesocosm study. However, the Agency still concluded that this pesticide may pose aquatic risk from use on cotton
and citrus and that the registration must remain conditional until the Agency had evaluated the effectiveness of
the risk reduction measures and completed its aquatic risk assessment. By April 30, 1995, or sooner, the Agency intends
to complete review of all data and other information submitted and to make FIFRA section 3(c)(5) or other appropriate
regulatory decisions for the cotton and citrus use of avermectin B

1

.
To be consistent with the extensions issued for the conditional registrations, the Agency is proposing to renew the
tolerances on cotton, citrus and other affected commodities. The Agency has determined that renewing the tolerances
will protect the human health. Therefore, renewals for the tolerances on cotton, citrus, and other affected crops
are proposed as set forth below.

The data submitted in support of these tolerances and other relevant material have been reviewed. The toxicological
and metabolism data and analytical methods for enforcement purposes considered in support of these tolerances are
discussed in detail in related documents published in the 

Federal Registers

 of May 31, 1989 (54 FR 23209) for cottonseed and August 2, 1989 (54 FR 31836) for citrus.

Residues remaining in or on the above raw agricultural commodity after expiration of these tolerances will not be
considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during the term of and in accordance with the provisions
of the conditional registrations.

Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request
within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of FIFRA.

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number (PP 7F3500, 8F3592, FAP 8H5650/P586). All written comments filed in response
to this petition will be available to the Public Response Section, at the address given above from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday, except legal holidays.

The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Executive Order 12866.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or food/feed additive regulations
or raising tolerance or food/feed additive regulation levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements
do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to
this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
