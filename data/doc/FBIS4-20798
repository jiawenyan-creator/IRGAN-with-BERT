  [Text] According to figures reported by the Center for the 
Expansion of Exports, during the eight months of the current 
year, 1,301 tons of onions, with a value of 4 million rials [R], 
have been exported. 
  In other words, we have sold a kilo of onions for R3, which 
means that our total profit from the sale of onions has been 
only $200, with R2,000 being equivalent to 1 dollar. Is it worth 
getting engaged in such exports only to ruin our domestic onions 
market? 
  Have we not ruined the export culture by such exports? 
  Not to mention the losses suffered by the poor 
exporters--while the price of onions in domestic markets was 10 
times--no, 100 times--more than what it was sold for abroad. 
  Then, let us not plead the cause of farmers when middlemen 
run away with the wind-blown profit and when officials are 
blamed for the bad onion markets here and abroad. 
  Finally, the clamor of publicity on importing onions lost 
its 
momentum. However, a kilo of onions went up to R1,000. 
  God willing, the concerned officials, particularly those of 
the Ministry of Agriculture, may have learned some lesson from 
all this.
