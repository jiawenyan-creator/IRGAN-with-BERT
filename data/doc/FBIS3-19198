<H5>  Statements by the Social Democratic Party of Austria </H5>
  Party Chairman [Franz] Vranitzky said: "This is a sad 
Sunday." Nevertheless, important objectives, such as entry into 
the European Union [EU], full employment, and social security, 
have to continue to be pursued. It is simple to give advice 
from the "box seat of the opposition" because the opposition 
does not have any responsibility. The resignation of [Carinthian 
Governor] Ambrozy is not the deciding issue, he said. 
  Commenting on Carinthia, Federal Manager [Josef] Cap said: 
"This is sad but not hopeless. We will nevertheless claim the 
provincial governorship." 
<H5>  Statements by the Austrian People's Party [OeVP]l </H5>
  Chairman [Erhard] Busek said: "It is a good day for the 
OeVP." The result reassures me, as far as the EU referendum and 
federal policies are concerned. The stability and the 
credibility of our politicians have paid off. 
  Secretary General [Ingrid] Korosec said: This is altogether 
a good result for the OeVP. [OeVP Governor of Carinthia 
Christoph] Zernatto has stood his ground in Carinthia. The 
losses in Salzburg and Tirol are smaller than predicted. 
<H5>  Statements by the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] </H5>
  [FPOe Chairman] [Joerg] Haider said: I will negotiate for 
the office of Carinthian governor. Talks with the OeVP will 
also be held in the other provinces. 
  Secretary General [Walter] Meischberger said: "This is a 
fantastic election success." Anyone else but Haider as a 
provincial governor would mean that the voters' will is being 
disregarded. At any rate, all three results are a clear answer 
from the voters to the government's results in the EU 
negotiations. 
<H5>  Statements by the Greens, Liberals </H5>
  Greens Floor Leader [Madeleine] Petrovic said: Tribute has 
been paid to our serious work and untiring support for 
environmental protection. The results can be regarded as a 
rejection of the way in which federal politicians are dealing 
with EU criteria. Federal Spokesman [Peter] Pilz said: "The 
results show that several things went wrong" in Brussels. 
  [Heide] Schmidt, the federal spokeswoman of the Liberal 
Forum, said: "The time for new thinking is not yet ripe." The 
electoral law, which is hostile toward minorities, has resulted 
in a distortion of the voters' will.
