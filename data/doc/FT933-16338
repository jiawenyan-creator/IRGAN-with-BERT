FT  03 JUL 93 / News At Ten plan attacked by MPs
THE National Heritage Select Committee yesterday condemned ITV for its
proposals to move News At Ten to an early evening slot in the schedules.
The committee said it 'deplored both the proposal to reschedule News At Ten
and the evasive and wholly unconvincing manner in which representatives of
ITV sought to justify that proposal'.
