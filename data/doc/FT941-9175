FT  16 FEB 94 / People: Graham Walker joins F&amp;C Management
Graham Walker, 47, who was deputy managing director of Standard Chartered's
Scimitar fund management operation when it was taken over by Royal Bank of
Scotland in 1992, has been appointed chief operating officer and group
finance director of Foreign &amp; Colonial Management, the fund management
group.
Michael Hart, chairman of F &amp; C Fund Management, said that the group had
been growing at a 'tremendous rate' over the past few years and it made
sense to bring in someone from outside with administrative skills to help
plan and control the growth.
The group is jointly owned by Hypo Bank, Germany's fifth-biggest bank, and
five London investment trusts, and its funds under management have grown
from Pounds 1.4bn in 1985 to Pounds 10.3bn currently.
Walker, who trained as an accountant with Thomson McLintock, spent much of
his early career with the Wardley merchant banking group in Hong Kong before
joining Thomson McKinnon Securities in 1986 as regional vice-president for
Europe. In 1989 he was made deputy managing director of Standard Chartered
Equitor and in November 1992 he switched to Capital House.
