SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The University of Illinois at Chicago, Energy Resources Center has proposed organizing a consortium involving many
of Chicago's best known and most frequently visited cultural arts institutions. The purpose of this consortium is
to provide these institutions with a forum to increase the awareness and facilitate the use of energy efficiency technologies
and practices. The consortium will leverage public and private expertise and resources to accomplish this objective.
Activities of the consortium will include the development and execution of energy conservation facility management
workshops, an invitational conference for representatives of all Chicago area cultural arts institutions and the
development of a communications network for ongoing information sharing.



The unsolicited application for support of this activity has been accepted by DOE as a result of DOE's determination
that the proposed activity is meritorious, likely to be effective and successful, and offers a unique opportunity
for DOE to advance its mission of deploying and demonstrating the use of energy efficiency technologies and practices
in highly visible settings. The project period for the award is twelve months, expected to begin September 1994. DOE
plans to provide funding in the amount of $10,000. This award will not be made for at least 14 calendar days after publication
