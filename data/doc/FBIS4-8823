<F P=106> [Interview with National Democratic Federation Cochairman </F>
Zoltan Biro by Lajos Pogonyi; place and date not given: "One 
Should Also Pay Attention to the Pope!"] 
  [Text] Will the party reach the 5 percent necessary to 
make it into parliament? Can the third way, romantic 
anticapitalism, be sympathetic at the turn of the century? Why 
does it seem that the National Democratic Federation [NDSZ] is a 
"two-person" party? These were some of the questions we asked 
NDSZ Cochairman Zoltan Biro. 
  [Pogonyi] The NDSZ policy is often criticized for having 
many elements of romantic anticapitalism. The question arises: 
Is such a policy plausible and sympathetic at the turn of the 
century? 
  [Biro] Honesty is only rarely rewarding in politics. 
  [Pogonyi] In your view, what is honesty in politics? 
  [Biro] If one tries to coordinate the principle and the 
practice and if one tries to remain consistent. I do not like 
the expression "third way" because it can be misunderstood and 
misinterpreted. It is true that history made this impossible in 
1947-1948. However, time did not justify those who made this 
impossible; instead, what they called socialism has collapsed. 
I have the same opinion about capitalism. 
  [Pogonyi] It seems, however, that capitalism has not 
collapsed.... 
  [Biro] It really functions in welfare societies. If, 
however, the slightest danger emerges in connection with 
welfare, panic can immediately be felt and confidence in 
democracy begins to crumble. It itself, capitalism has not yet 
cured anything. It is increasingly irresponsible to speak about 
socialism and capitalism in the world. The world has failed to 
justify either of them. A lot of things prove the crisis of 
capitalism. 
  [Pogonyi] Do you think of being accused of social demagogy? 
When unemployment is high, it is rewarding to criticize 
capitalism. 
  [Biro] It was also rewarding to criticize socialism. We had 
a lot of experience in this respect during the change in the 
regime. Today, it is not so useful to criticize capitalism, 
because there are many people who believe in it blindly. 
However, they should listen to Pope John Paul II, who does not 
have many good words about capitalism either. You should also 
listen to the pope! It is a big experiment to create democracy 
under deteriorating economic conditions. 
  [Pogonyi] Is there still time for experiments? You are the 
ones who often mention the fact that this country has had enough 
of experiments. 
  [Biro] One should not engage in experiments, but we are not 
the ones who dictate this. We only said that we needed a change 
in the regime and that a democratic system was more humane that 
a non- democratic one. 
  [Pogonyi] Others have also said that. 
  [Biro] Yes, but we also mean this. 
  [Pogonyi] As for people having enough of all this, you used 
to say that what is going on in Parliament is mostly a circus. 
Nevertheless, the NDSZ also wants to make into Parliament. 
  [Biro] We do not have a bad opinion about parliament in 
general. Parliament is essential in democracy. 
  [Pogonyi] Is it a necessary evil? 
  [Biro] I would not say that either. The level of maturity 
is the point here, the maturity of democratic institutions, of 
the parliament, and of the parties. This parliament is still 
immature. Our main problem is how to create more mature 
institutions as soon as possible in a transitional period. This 
needs patience. Things should not be hastened, but they can 
affect history. The NDSZ was created in order to make into 
Parliament. 
  [Pogonyi] Will the party have the necessary 5 percent? 
  [Biro] I hope so. Gathering the nomination slips is a 
problem for a lot of parties. This is bankruptcy. 
  [Pogonyi] You travel around the country a lot. What do you 
see? Which parties have a good chance? Many people think that 
the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] might become overconfident 
and this could be fatal for the party. 
  [Biro] People in many places think that the MSZP might be 
such a big winner that it will be alone in Parliament and will 
be forced to form a government alone. I regard such a 
development as an unfortunate one. The problem is that, if the 
MSZP proves to be unable to carry out rapid and efficient 
changes, anti-communist feelings will emerge again. This would 
be painful for the MSZP and also for the activity of the entire 
Parliament. 
  [Pogonyi] In the view of the NDSZ, what government would be 
an ideal one? 
  [Biro] This is a personal opinion, and not the opinion of 
the my party: A center-right-center-left-center government 
would be desirable. 
  [Pogonyi] Is this not a little too much ? 
  [Biro] No. The transitional period requires this. 
  [Pogonyi] Too many parties would suppress each other. 
  [Biro] Not necessarily. There are many examples all over 
the world of right-wing and left-wing parties governing together. 
  [Pogonyi] Has the NDSZ prepared itself for a government 
role? 
  [Biro] It is easy to give an arrogant answer to this and say 
yes. Preparation depends on the type of people a party can 
gather around itself. 
  [Pogonyi] It seems that your experts do not appear in public 
too often. Why? 
  [Biro] We have many good experts. The question is whether 
the party is led by good politicians. 
  [Pogonyi] It seems that the NDSZ is a two-or three-person 
party. You and Imre Pozsgay, or the other way round, and Kata 
Beke. Did you develop the party this way deliberately? 
  [Biro] No, this was not something deliberate. There are 
people who also say that Pozsgay is flirting with the 
center-right and I am flirting with the center-left. Of course, 
this is not so. Becoming a politician is a natural process. 
Think of whom the public knew among the Christian Democrats or 
the Federation of Young Democrats at the beginning of the change 
in the regime.
