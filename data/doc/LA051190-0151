LOYOLA'S LAST HOME GAMES ON SUNDAY 
The 11th-ranked Loyola Marymount baseball team plays its last home games of the 
season Sunday in a noon non-conference double-header against U.S. 
International. 
The Lions (41-13) lead the West Coast Conference by 3 1/2 games pending 
second-place Pepperdine's three-game series at San Diego this weekend. 
The Lions and Waves will complete the WCC schedule and decide the conference 
title May 19-20 at Malibu. 
The Lions, who are completing finals week, will be playing for the first time 
in eight days when they face USIU. The same teams will play a single game 
Tuesday in San Diego to make up an earlier game that was rained out. Loyola won 
the first game, 16-7. 
All-American catcher Miah Bradbury has taken over the conference lead in runs 
batted in with 59 and trails Tony Kounas for the team lead in home runs, 15-14. 
The Lions' Rick Mediavilla remains the WCC's leading hitter at .410. He has 98 
hits and needs only eight more hits to break Don Sparks' school record set in 
1988. 
In sweeping a three-game series against Santa Clara last weekend, the Lions 
raised their team average to .338. ALAN DROOZ
