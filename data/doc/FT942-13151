FT  26 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo in the bid frame
The stakebuilding/takeover speculation that has surrounded Lasmo since the
oil exploration group announced its Pounds 219m rights issue two weeks ago
erupted again yesterday with the market responding to strong rumours that a
180p a share bid will be launched this morning.
The bid rumours were accompanied by another session of heavy activity in
Lasmo ordinary shares, in the new 'nil-paid' stock and in the traded
options. The ordinaries closed 8 higher at 155p, after 158p, with turnover
reaching 18m shares, while the new nil-paids settled 8 firmer at 50p, after
54p on 7.7m traded.
Lasmo was the heaviest traded in the options market where the equivalent of
2.2m shares changed hands. The turnovers in the stock, nil-paids and options
yesterday were similar to big volumes in all three for much of last week.
Dealers said that among the favourites to launch a bid for Lasmo were
Enterprise, Elf, British Gas, PowerGen and Arco. The company's advisers
maintained, however, that there were no signs of any abnormal patterns in
trading in the shares and that the stock is purely being re-rated,
especially by US investors in the light of the recent rise in the oil price.
Crude oil prices, now around Dollars 16 a barrel, were trading below Dollars
14 a barrel as the rights terms were set.
