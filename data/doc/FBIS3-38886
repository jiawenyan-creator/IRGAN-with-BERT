the End of the War; Over 4 Million People Without Jobs"] 
  [Text] Nuremberg -- The number of unemployed in Germany in 
January exceeded 4 million for the first time. On 31 January, a 
total of 4,029,491 million were registered as unemployed in 
eastern and western Germany. This is an increase of over 
340,000 since the end of December. The rise in the old laender 
was about 222,400. Unemployment increased from 8.1 percent to 
8.8 percent in western Germany, and from 15.4 percent to 17 
percent in the east of the country. The president of the 
Federal Employment Office, Bernhard Jagoda, stressed that the 
rise has mainly been caused by seasonal factors. Economics 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt spoke of the greatest challenge for the 
state and the society since the founding of the FRG. 
  Without allowing for the impact of special seasonal factors 
on developments in the labor market, the number of unemployed 
rose by 27,000, Jagoda announced in Nuremberg on Tuesday [9 
February]. The economic difficulties were particularly felt in 
western Germany whereas structural adjustments continue to 
influence the labor market in eastern Germany. In addition, the 
number of jobs declined again in the old laender. At 28.8 
million, there were 600,000 fewer employees at the end of the 
year than in December 1992. 
  Despite the new record of 2,736,068 million unemployed in 
the 
old laender in January, and in spite of the general decline in 
employment, the increase in unemployment has been slightly 
slower since autumn 1993. Compared with the previous January, 
the number of unemployed had risen by about 479,000. Last 
October, the increase from the same month in 1992 was over 
528,000. Jagoda stated that he proceeds from the premise that 
the situation will "improve tangibly" in the course of the year. 
This would mean that average unemployment would remain below 4 
million in 1994. 
  Short-time work was also reduced in eastern and western 
Germany. In the west, the number of those affected by regular 
work shortages dropped from 556,192 to 517,374. In the east, 
the number declined by 10,000 to 115,900 in January. The 
decline is even clearer if one compares last year with the 
previous year. The number dropped by 340,000 in the west and by 
nearly 99,000 in the east. 
  Jagoda believes that the rise of unemployment in the new 
laender by 118,000 to 1,293,400 is also mainly due to seasonal 
factors. However, the number of jobless also rose because the 
impact of job creation measures, advanced training, and other 
instruments of labor market policy has weakened. 
  Thus, the number of jobs created within this scheme dropped 
from 325,510 last year to approximately 223,000 in January 1994. 
Early retirement has also declined sharply. If one includes 
short-time work, the measures by the labor offices have 
prevented about 1.3 million unemployed in the east. In January 
1993, the number was 1.7 million. 
  The number of employed in the old laender did not drop as 
much in December as it had in the previous year. However, 
according to a report by the Federal Statistics Office in 
Wiesbaden released on Tuesday, at 28.437 million, their number 
had still decreased by 621,000 or 2.1 percent from last year. 
In October and November, a decline of 2.2 percent was 
registered. Taking into consideration seasonal factors, 
employment declined by 6,000 in December from the previous year. 
One year ago, the figure was 39,000. 
  Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of 
Germany) described the negative record as "one of the greatest 
challenges for the state and society" since the founding of the 
FRG. The social spokesman of the Bundestag Group of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany, Ottmar Schreiner, accused the 
government of manipulating the statistics. He stated that, 
through joint projects, it wants to introduce "some kind of 
voluntary labor service" for the unemployed, and to eliminate 
them from the unemployment statistics. The Bundestag Group of 
the Alliance 90/Greens spoke of a complete failure of the labor 
policy of the coalition.
