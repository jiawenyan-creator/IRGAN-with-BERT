FT  03 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Racal Electronics
If the size of the write-off at Redac was what unnerved Racal shareholders
yesterday, then a closer look might have reassured. Some Pounds 13.9m of the
Pounds 20.2m provision was a write-back of acquisition goodwill which had
previously been charged to the balance sheet. The Accounting Standards Board
is clearly right to insist that companies should not buy, run and sell a
business without recognising permanent losses of goodwill. Yet in this case,
as many others, the write-off is of merely historical interest with little
relevance to future prospects.
Equally, the 15 per cent fall in the share price may have reflected worries
about trading prospects. Military radio is an increasingly competitive field
in a shrinking defence market. The constant struggle to raise margins in the
data communications business is a race to stand still, since even
sophisticated technologies are rapidly becoming commodities. Managed
networks is a growth area but the company is pitched against some tough
telecoms competition. As ever, Racal's problem is to keep enough plates
spinning to keep profits moving. Avoiding nasty surprises might please the
market too.
