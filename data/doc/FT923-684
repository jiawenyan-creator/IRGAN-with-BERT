FT  26 SEP 92 / International Company News: Wiedekin takes over from Bohn at
Porsche
MR WENDELIN Wiedekin, currently head of production at Porsche, was yesterday
voted, with the unanimous backing of the supervisory board, as successor to
Mr Arno Bohn as chief executive of the luxury car company.
The supervisory board met yesterday two days after the surprise announcement
that Mr Bohn was leaving Porsche because of differences of opinion over
business policy.
Mr Wiedekin will take over the job from next Thursday.
Yesterday's statement gave no clue as to the business differences which have
led to Mr Bohn's departure, but it is likely that more comprehensive
explanations will be forthcoming from both Porsche and Mr Bohn next week,
after the latter has formally severed his ties with the company.
Porsche said also that as an export-driven company, its sales would be hit
hard by the appreciation of the D-Mark in recent weeks.
The previously agreed cost-cutting measures would be introduced as quickly
as possible, the brief statement said.
During the current financial year Porsche is planning to cut more jobs than
the 550 it shed last year.
