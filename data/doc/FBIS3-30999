  [Text] On the occasion of the agreed cease-fire and the 
withdrawal of artillery from around Sarajevo, General Manojlo 
Milovanovic, member of the general staff of the army of the 
Srpska republic, and General Milan Gvero, deputy commander of 
the general staff of the army of the Srpska republic, met the 
representatives of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces], 
General (Magnus) Ramsey, head of the UNPROFOR staff for the 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and General Andre Soubirou, head of 
the UNPROFOR sector for Sarajevo, in Pale today. 
  After the meeting, Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic said that 
progress has been achieved in the talks because despite all that 
is happening, the 24th truce has still been lasting the longest. 
Gen. Milovanovic said that the Serbian side has imposed the 
condition that there will be no grouping and pulling out of the 
artillery, which means that artillery will remain where it is 
and UNPROFOR is obligated to ensure control of the cease-fire. 
Members of the UNPROFOR have accepted this condition because no 
document, including the one adopted by NATO, speaks about a 
definite [kategorican] withdrawal of weapons, but only about 
putting them under UNPROFOR control. 
  By the way, Muslim forces have continued violating the 
agreed 
cease-fire on the Sarajevo battlefield. On the Vogosca section 
of the front, they are opening mortar and infantry fire on the 
Serbian defense lines around the Traffic Faculty. The 
cease-fire does not apply to Muslim snipers who are shooting 
from their strongholds at all sections of Serbian Sarajevo. So 
far there have been no reports of casualties.
