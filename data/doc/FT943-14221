FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: US food pioneer dies in crash
Mr Bob Payton, the 50-year-old founder of many of Britain's best-known
US-style restaurants, died in a car crash on Wednesday night.
Mr Payton came to the UK from Chicago in 1973 and set up the Chicago Rib
Shack, Chicago Pizza Pie Factory and Henry J Beans food chains.
He revelled in the fact that he had initially faced cynicism from many
British financiers over his plans to serve American style food to the
British.
However, he recently won over the City when My Kinda Town, the company
comprising his restaurant chains, was floated in May. The company currently
has a market capitalisation of Pounds 32m.
The company was launched on the stock market as a means of buying out the
group's main backers and Mr Payton himself raised about Pounds 4.5m from
share sales.
More of his recent attention had been focused on his 16th century
Leicestershire mansion, Stapleford Park, which had also been launched as a
country hotel.
The restaurant business expanded at an extraordinary rate, and Mr Payton was
never short of new ideas, with recent additions to the stable coming in the
form of Chicago Meatpackers, Tacos and Salsa]
His ambitions did not stop with the UK. By the time of the flotation, his
chain covered 29 restaurants and bars in 17 cities, ranging from Belfast to
Beirut.
Mr Payton retired from the board of My Kinda Town at the time of the
flotation, leaving a company which made about Pounds 2m last year.
