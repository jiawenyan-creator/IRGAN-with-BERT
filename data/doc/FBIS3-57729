  [Text] Moscow January 27 TASS -- Sergey Yushenkov, chairman 
of the State Duma Defence Committee and a leader of Russia's 
Choice, said his faction may call for a vote of confidence in 
the Viktor Chernomyrdin government. 
  Yushenkov told a news conference on Thursday the call will 
come if the faction finds "decisions made by Chenomyrdin's 
cabinet pose a real threat of a catastrophe in Russia," 
particularly in a situation where "the president remains all but 
the last guarantor of reforms and stability in Russia." 
  Commenting on the latest reshuffle in the government, the 
parliamentarian said the decision that Yegor Gaydar and other 
pro-reform ministers should quit was taken by Russia's Choice 
think-tank. However, no complete exodus of the faction's 
members from the government was planned, he added. 
  First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays and other four 
ministers, including Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, will 
continue to work under Chernomyrdin. As one of the four, the 
Science Minister Boris Saltykov put it, "as long as I am able to 
carry on reforms, I will stay in the government. I believe this 
will eventually be more effective than any spectacular demarche."
