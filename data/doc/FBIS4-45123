  [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- Satisfaction was evoked in 
Russia by statements of the Governments of the United States and 
Great Britain in connection with the implementation since May 
30, 1994, of arrangements between the leaders of the three 
states on detargeting of stategic nuclear missiles. Grigoriy 
Karasin, spokesman of the Russian Foreign Ministry, told this a 
briefing on Tuesday. 
  The Russian side again expresses the hope that 
implementation 
by Russia, the United States and Great Britain of the initiative 
for detargeting will precede further measures for 
confidence-building and strategic stability and will set an 
example to other nuclear powers, the spokesman said.
