METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEIGHT LAW STIFFENED FOR VENTURA BLVD. 
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday strengthened a temporary 45-foot height 
limit for new buildings on Ventura Boulevard by strictly defining how to 
measure a building's height. 
The measure, which applies to the entire 17-mile length of the boulevard from 
Studio City to Woodland Hills, was prompted by angry Studio City residents who 
complained that a 95-foot Ventura Boulevard office building blocked their view 
of the San Fernando Valley. 
Under the law, building heights will be measured from the lowest point of the 
curb on Ventura Boulevard. 
The restrictions are designed to close a loophole in the boulevard's temporary 
construction-control ordinance, which was enacted in 1985 to give city planners 
time to set standards for the Valley's most commercially popular thoroughfare. 
Although the 1985 ordinance restricted heights to 45 feet, it did not clearly 
state how the buildings should be measured.
