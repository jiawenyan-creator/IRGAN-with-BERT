FT  08 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Veba - Other companies
The energy-based conglomerate reports half-way figures on Thursday. Much
favoured among investors, especially after a 35 per cent earnings increase
in the first quarter, its stock has recently been towed upwards by rising
interest in the German chemicals sector. Although far smaller than the
national giants, its chemicals division has been radically restructured and
is performing strongly.
