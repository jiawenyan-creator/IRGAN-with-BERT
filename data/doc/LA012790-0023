ALBERT'S PERFORMANCE NOT WHAT NHL NEEDED 
It was nice to see network TV finally recognize the NHL by televising the 
All-Star game. However, if the purpose was to help expand awareness of this 
sport to the American public, NBC made one drastic mistake. By having Marv 
Albert do the play-by-play, more potential fans were probably scared away due 
to his ineptness.
