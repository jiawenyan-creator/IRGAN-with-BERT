    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian in the 1100 GMT "Novosti" newscast on 
10 June carries a 2-minute video report by correspondent Irina 
Mishina on an exhibition of new GAZ cars in central Moscow which 
was attended by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets. 
After describing the cars, Mishina reports: 
  "Automobiles were not the only subject brought up. There was 
also mention of the reports in which journalists have firmly 
predicted that Oleg Soskovets will be the next prime minister." 
  A recording of remarks by Oleg Soskovets then follows. He 
says: 
  "This is obviously a provocation by your esteemed 
journalistic colleagues. They understand their role in the 
economic reforms as being constantly to provoke some political 
situation or other. I have no other thoughts on this subject."
