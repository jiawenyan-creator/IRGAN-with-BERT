FT  23 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: South Africa resists fall
Industrial shares led a recovery in early afternoon trade as buying interest
continued in spite of weaker world markets. A slight rise in the price of
gold bullion was also a contributing factor.
Analysts said the undertone in industrials was firm and prospects in coming
weeks remained steady.
The overall index was 7.4 better at 5,909.2 after earlier touching 5,879,
the industrial index gained 41.2 at 6,984.1 and the gold shares index was
11.2 lower at 2,092.5.
Absa eased from recent highs, shedding 15 cents to R11.10, but Investec
advanced R1.75 to R68 and Rand Merchant Bank Holdings rose R2 to R38 after
lagging behind the major banks recently.
De Beers was again under pressure, declining R1.25 to R95.75, while Anglos
was 50 cents off at R239.50.
SAB slipped 25 cents to R100 and Sasol receded 15 cents to R35. Sappi
collected 50 cents at R73 and Hiveld put on 50 cents at R35.25.
