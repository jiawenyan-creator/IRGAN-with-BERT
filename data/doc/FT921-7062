FT  25 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Rent dispute at Mirror HQ
A dispute has arisen over whether Mirror Group Newspapers has paid all the
rent due on its Holborn headquarters, the High Court heard yesterday, writes
Raymond Hughes.
Mr Jeffery Onions, counsel for the administrative receivers of Robert
Maxwell Estates, co-lessor of the Mirror building and other properties
leased to Maxwell Communication Corporation, said some but not all of the
rent due had been paid after service earlier this month of a notice under
the 1908 Law of Distress Amendment Act.
The next quarterly rent was due on March 24. If payment was not received RME
would return to court to seek leave to start proceedings for possession of
the Mirror building.
