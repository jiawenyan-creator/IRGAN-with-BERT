SIMONE COUSTEAU, 72; DIVER, WIFE OF JACQUES 
Simone Cousteau, an accomplished underwater diver who accompanied her husband, 
Jacques Yves Cousteau, on hundreds of voyages aboard the marine research ship 
Calypso, has died at her home in Monaco. 
The Cousteau Foundation said Monday that she was 72 when she died Sunday of 
undisclosed causes. 
Married in 1937, the Cousteaus for years spent most of their time aboard the 
Calypso, sailing throughout the world to study marine biology, conduct 
underwater explorations, make films and promote conservation. 
Known by the Calypso's crew as "the shepherdess," Mrs. Cousteau served as nurse 
and purser while also participating in underwater missions. 
She was one of the first women to dive using an autonomous underwater helmet 
and believed to be the first to live in an underwater house when she spent a 
week in 1963 with her husband and four assistants 33 feet beneath the surface 
of the Red Sea. 
Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Jean-Michel. A second son, 
Philippe, died in a plane crash in 1981.
