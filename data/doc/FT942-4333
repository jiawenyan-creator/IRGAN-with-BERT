FT  10 JUN 94 / Dairy Crest to shed 600 jobs
Dairy Crest, the milk processing and dairy products arm of the Milk
Marketing Board, plans to cut 12.5 per cent of its workforce - 600 jobs - by
the end of the year in response to increasingly competitive market
conditions.
The company said some of the job losses would involve compulsory
redundancies. Most of the jobs lost will be from layers of management which
Dairy Crest said had become too bureaucratic under the culture of the Milk
Marketing Board.
The company said the job cuts were part of its rationalisation plans to get
the business into shape for a planned stock market flotation, possibly in
November. Dairy Crest is being spun off from the milk board when Britain's
Pounds 3.3bn milk market is liberalised on November 1.
In the run-up to deregulation, increased competition and supermarket price
wars have put pressure on dairy companies' profit margins.
Mr John Houliston, Dairy Crest chief executive, said: 'We are operating in
an extremely competitive market which shows no sign of getting any easier.
'We must ensure we can compete in the prevailing demanding conditions.'
