FT  18 JUL 92 / Teachers' merit pay plan proposed
A CONTROVERSIAL scheme to link teachers' pay to examination results and
truancy rates was floated yesterday by the school teachers' pay review body,
Andrew Adonis writes.
If implemented, all teachers except those in nursery schools would be
eligible for one-off payments to reward annual improvements in school
performances.
The primary school yardstick would be pupil attendance rates and annual
tests for seven-year-olds. In secondary schools it would be performance in
GCSE, A-level and vocational exams, national curriculum tests, truancy
levels and destination of pupils at 16.
The review body was commissioned by the government to devise a scheme for
extending performance-related pay. It admitted the proposed measures were
'crude', but said they would serve as a basis for future refinement.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, welcomed the review body's call for a pilot scheme. 'To launch
into a scheme which is found to be defective would be disastrous,' he said.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers union, said the
plan was 'philistine and market-oriented'.
