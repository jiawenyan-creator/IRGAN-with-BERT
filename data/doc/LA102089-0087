LEMOND WILL MISS FIRST RACE OF 3-DAY TOUR OF PALM SPRINGS 
The Tour of Palm Springs, a three-day cycling event, will begin today at 7 a.m. 
with a 4.2-mile time trial up the tramway road in Palm Springs. 
Competition will continue Saturday morning at 8:30 with a 75-mile road race, 
starting at Sunrise Park, and Sunday morning at 10 with a 40-mile criterium in 
downtown Palm Springs. 
Greg LeMond, winner of the Tour de France last summer, was to have ridden in 
all three events, but he and his wife were awaiting the imminent birth of a 
child in Minneapolis Thursday and he will miss at least today's hill climb.
