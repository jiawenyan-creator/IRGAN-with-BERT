FT  15 DEC 93 / Bond trader is jailed
Mr Paul Mozer, the former head of government bond trading at Salomon
Brothers, was sentenced to four months' imprisonment last night for his role
in the Treasury auction scandal that pushed the Wall Street securities firm
into deep crisis in 1991, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
Mr Mozer had faced a maximum of 10 years in prison under the offence.
Judge Pierre Laval of the US district court in Manhattan, who described the
38-year-old Mr Mozer's crimes as 'foolish, arrogant and insouciant,' also
fined him a total of Dollars 30,100.
Yesterday's sentencing followed a plea agreement earlier this year between
the former Salomon trader and federal prosecutors. Under the terms of the
agreement Mr Mozer pleaded guilty to two felony counts relating to his
falsifying of customer bids during auctions of US government securities.
