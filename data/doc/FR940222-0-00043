ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone on the Ohio River. The regulation is needed to control vessel traffic
in the regulated area to prevent potential environmental and safety hazards associated with commercial vessels
transporting cargoes regulated under title 46 Code of Federal Regulations Subchapters D and O, while transiting
downbound at night during high water conditions. The regulation will restrict commercial navigation in the regulated
area for the safety of vessel traffic and the protection of life and property along the river.

EFFECTIVE DATES: 

This regulation is effective on February 11, 1994 at 10 a.m. e.s.t. It will terminate at 6 p.m. e.s.t. on February 22,
1994 unless sooner terminated by the captain of the Port, Louisville, Kentucky.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Drafting Information


The drafter of this regulation is LT Dale L. Hutchinson, Project Officer, Marine Safety Office, Louisville, Kentucky,
and LCDR A. O. Denny, Project Attorney, Second Coast Guard District Legal Office.


Regulatory History


In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, the high water periods in the Cincinnati, Ohio area are
natural events which cannot be predicted with any reasonable accuracy. The Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's
best interest to issue a regulation now as the situation presents an immediate hazard to navigation, life, and property.


Background and Purpose


The situation requiring this regulation is high water in the Ohio River in the vicinity of Cincinnati, Ohio. The Ohio
River in the Cincinnati area is hazardous to transit under the best of conditions. To transit the area, mariners must
navigate through several sweeping turns and seven bridges. When the water level in the Ohio River reaches 45 feet,
on the Cincinnati gage, river currents increase and become very unpredictable, making it difficult for downbound
vessels to maintain steerageway. During hours of darkness the background lights of the city of Cincinnati hamper
mariners' ability to maintain sight of the front of their tow. The regulation is intended to protect the public and
the environment, at night, during periods of high water, from a potential hazard of large downbound tows carrying
hazardous material through the regulated area.


Regulatory Evaluation


This rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under
Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979), it will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of information
requirements.
The Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.


Federalism Assessment


Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.


Environmental Assessment


The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation as an
action required to protect the public and the environment.
