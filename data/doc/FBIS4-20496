<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  Since the 1980's, femtosecond (fs) lasers have been made 
primarily from CPM (colliding pulse mode-locked) dye lasers. In 
recent years, although the use of a Ti-doped sapphire laser to 
produce fs pulses appears to be very promising and is 
progressing very rapidly, the CPM laser still remains an 
important tool in applied research on femtosecond science 
because the associated technology and equipment are more mature, 
devices are easier to obtain, more robust and stable. Earlier, 
the shortest light pulse produced by a CPM laser was 27 
fs.[.sup]1[/] Lately, a shorter pulse has been 
reported.[.sup]2[/] In this work, an 18-fs pulse is directly 
produced by a modified CPM laser. As far as the authors know, 
this is the shortest pulse ever produced by this type of laser. 
The auto-correlation curve of the pulse intensity shows that the 
pulse is an optical soliton. When the 27-fs pulse is compressed 
to 21 fs and 18 fs, the pulse reflecting higher orders of the 
soliton disappear. The pulse becomes close to a 
fundamental-soliton hyperbolic secant (Sech[.sup]2[/]) 
intensity profile. This is a new phenomenon not observed before, 
and indicates that the selection and tuning of SPM (spontaneous 
phase modulation) and GVD (group velocity dispersion) are 
critical to pulse compression. We believe that this is also an 
advantage of the CPM laser in generating fs pulses. It is 
difficult for other types of laser to match it. 
<H5>  2. Experimental Principle and Setup </H5>
  The CPM laser has advanced considerably since 
1981.[.sup]3[/] The greatest improvement has been to install 
a four-prism group-velocity compensator.[.sup]4[/] This 
enables the laser to compress chirped pulses, in addition to its 
gain saturation effect and absorption saturation effect (the 
colliding pulses enhance the absorption saturation effect). It 
is analogous to the compression of the chirped pulses in an 
optical fiber by the negative group velocity of the material 
into a soliton pulse. Therefore, a CPM laser is also known as a 
quasi-soliton laser. These two pulse-compression mechanisms 
enable a CPM laser to produce shorter pulses, but also add to 
its complexity and variability. After taking the two 
pulse-compression mechanisms into account, the width of the 
Sech[.sup]2[/] pulse as a function of various parameters can 
be solved from the self-consistent equation of the optical field 
inside the cavity:[.sup]5[/] 
  _t_[.sup]2[/] = 1/g[.sub]0[/] (a[.sub]1[/] - 
a[.sub]2[/]x - b[.sub]1[/]y) (1) 
  where g[.sub]0[/] is the net gain at the center frequency 
_o_[.sub]0[/]. The first term in the parenthesis, 
a[.sub]1[/], is the gain dispersion term and it reflects the 
effect of the bandwidth of the pulse _D__n_. The larger 
_D__n_ 
is, the smaller a[.sub]1[/] becomes and the easier a short 
pulse can be obtained. In the third term, b[.sub]1[/] 
represents the gain change caused by fast saturation of the 
absorber, and y represents the pulse energy. In the second term, 
a[.sub]2[/] is the GVD and x is the chirp parameter. This 
term reflects the SPM and GVD compression effects. In a CPM 
laser, two nonlinear optical processes can produce SPM and also 
lead to chirping. One is a negative chirp caused by a 
reflectance change from a slow absorption saturation effect and 
the other is a positive chirp caused by the fast Kerr effect of 
the solvent in the absorber. Under normal conditions, the chirps 
generated by these two processes cancel each other because of 
opposite signs. The resultant net chirp is insignificant. 
Although pulse compression is possible by GVD tuning, the effect 
is not significant. The pulse width is primarily determined by 
the bandwidth of the gain. The narrowest width is 30-40 fs. We 
found that a higher pulse intensity inside the cavity not only 
enhances the gain and absorption saturation effects but also 
makes it easier to obtain a shorter pulse.[.sup]6[/] More 
importantly, the leading factor is to make the positive chirp 
produced by the fast Kerr effect of the absorber solvent far 
greater than the negative chirp produced due to dye saturation. 
It was calculated that when the peak pulse power is greater than 
0.2 x 10[.sup]6[/] W, the pulse has a larger positive chirp. 
It is easier to obtain a shorter pulse by way of negative GVD 
compression. At the same time, a larger positive SPM broadens 
the frequency spectrum of the pulse to lift the restriction 
imposed by the gain bandwidth. On the basis of this unique 
property of the CPM laser, we made some improvements in areas 
such as resonant cavity design, dye concentration and pumping 
condition that result in a larger frequency bandwidth and a 
larger positive SPM. Thus, a suitable negative GVD compensation 
can be introduced by tuning the prism GVD compensator to obtain 
a narrow fs pulse. It is estimated that with a large positive 
chirp and an ideal GVD compensation, it is possible to compress 
a pulse from its normal width of 30-40 fs by a half. 
  The CPM dye laser is a system comprised of six mirrors and 
four prisms. Compared to a classic CPM system, its unique 
feature is the use of an anti-symmetric folded cavity as a 
sub-cavity for its gain medium and absorber. This design not 
only provides better aberration compensation but also permits 
near-normal incidence and reflection at all mirror surfaces, 
i.e., a quasi-linear cavity.[.sup]7[/] This design improves 
the mode of the light beam to produce a TEM[.sub]00[/] 
output. The frequency band of the continuous light (without the 
absorber) is also significantly broadened and the tunable range 
is 580-620 nm. In the meantime, the system employs a 
shorter-focus pumping lens to lower the CW operating threshold, 
in turn raising the pulse energy inside the cavity. Furthermore, 
a thicker absorption coating is used to produce a larger 
positive chirp. All these measures make it easier to produce a 
shorter pulse. 
  The width of the femtosecond pulse from the CPM laser is 
measured by a computer-controlled precision non-co-linear 
auto-correlator.[.sup]8[/] The frequency doubler KDP is 0.30 
mm thick and the accuracy of the instrument is less than 1 fs 
(single-pass). Human error is eliminated by using an IBM-PC to 
measure, calculate and plot pulse width. The power spectrum of 
the fs pulse is automatically recorded using a scanning 
monochromator. 
<H5>  3. Experimental Results and Discussion </H5>
  Figure 1 shows the intensity auto-correlation curves of a 
series of short fs pulses from the CPM laser. The figure also 
shows the corresponding FWHM (full height half maximum) values 
(assuming a Sech[.sup]2[/] profile). The shortest pulse is 18 
fs. These short fs pulses were obtained under the same set of 
conditions, such as absorber dye DODCI concentration [congruent] 2 x 
10[.sup]-4[/] mol/L and pumping power [congruent] 6 W (full line), by 
carefully adjusting the position of the saturated absorber 
relative to the sub-cavity (approximately 100 m from the 
focal point) and the negative GVD compensation amount of the GVD 
prism to achieve a suitable balance between SPM and GVD. A 
shorter pulse corresponds to a less negative GVD compensation 
value. Figure 2 shows that when the pulse is compressed to less 
than 30 fs, higher-order soliton behavior becomes more apparent. 
There is a small base on each wing. When the pulse is compressed 
to below 20 fs, the bases disappear and the pulse agrees with 
the Sech[.sup]2[/] profile. Variations in pulse width and 
pulse base reflect the chirped pulse compression process. If the 
compression effect is greater than any pulse broadening effect 
due to other factors, the pulse behaves like a higher-order 
soliton. The upper part of the pulse is more compressed than the 
lower part, such as that shown in the intensity auto-correlation 
curve for the 27-fs pulse. This corresponds to the situation of 
a third-order soliton.[.sup]9[/] The energy at the base may 
be compressed to the center of the pulse or to somewhere far 
away, causing both sides close to the center to collapse to form 
a negative base. The pulse shape agrees with the 
Sech[.sup]2[/] profile. From the 21-fs and 18-fs intensity 
auto-correlation curves shown in Figure 1, this situation has 
been predicated by existing femtosecond pulse transmission 
theory. It will be discussed in detail in a separate paper.

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-006-15A>      Figure 2. Power Spectra of the 27-fs Pulse (a) and 18-fs </FIG>


  The power spectra of fs pulses from the CPM laser show that 
when the pulse is narrowed, the band is broadened and the center 
shifted toward the red. Furthermore, it exhibits a soliton pulse 
pattern. Figure 2(a) shows the power spectrum corresponding to 
the 27-fs pulse. It has a peak at 630 nm. It also has a wide 
band within a half-width of 620-635 nm and forms a spectrum 
seat. This is similar to the behavior of a soliton pulse 
observed by Mollenauer in his optical fiber 
experiment.[.sup]10[/] When the pulse is compressed to 21 fs 
and 18 fs, the base disappears, the pulse becomes more symmetric 
and the frequency distribution is also broadened. Figure 2(b) 
shows the frequency distribution of the 21-fs-wide pulse. Its 
FWHM is 17.8 nm. Its time-bandwidth product, i.e., 
_D_t_D__n_, 
is [congruent] 0.292, which is slightly less than that of an ideal 
Sech[.sup]2[/] curve of 0.315. However, it is far greater 
than that of an exponential decay (i.e., _D_t_D__n_ [congruent] 
0.11). 
This indicates that the pulse is close to a Sech[.sup]2[/] 
curve, rather than an exponential decay. The intensity 
auto-correlation curves for the 21- and 18-fs pulses shown in 
Figure 1 are in excellent agreement with the theoretical 
Sech[.sup]2[/] curves (dotted lines). 
  In conclusion, the shortest pulse obtained to date from the 
CPM laser is 18 fs. Furthermore, its soliton behavior has been 
observed. This further demonstrates the superiority of the CPM 
laser as a distributive quasi-soliton laser and its capability 
to generate shorter pulses. We believe that even shorter pulses 
can be produced by modifying the dye composition, increasing its 
frequency bandwidth and improving its stability.
