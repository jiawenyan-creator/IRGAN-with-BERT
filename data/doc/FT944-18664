FT  03 OCT 94 / Clarke is warned over investment
Recovery is unlikely to be sustained unless there is a rise in investment,
especially in small and medium-sized companies, Midlands business leaders
are warning Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
Mr Geoffrey Nicholls, chairman of East Midlands Confederation of British
Industry, said: 'The danger to the recovery is the very slow movement of
investment. Until we see a more improved movement in investment, we cannot
say that the recovery will be solidly based for the long term.'
Birmingham Chamber of Commerce reported in its September survey that fewer
than a quarter of companies were revising upwards their investment plans for
equipment and machinery.
Mr David Botterill, chief executive of West Midlands Engineering Employers
Federation, said: 'A lot of the investment which is taking place is
cost-reducing defensive investment rather than new markets and expansionist
investment.'
Although companies are reporting larger order books, Mr David Probert,
chamber president, noted that demand for manufacturing industries is
export-led where margins and profits are tight.
