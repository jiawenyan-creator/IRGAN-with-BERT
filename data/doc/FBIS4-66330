  [Text] Micro-submicrometer [5,3,1, and 0.7 m] P-MOSFETs 
have been investigated using a recently developed electron-beam 
doping technique. It is shown that the doping technique can be 
used for fabrication of micro-submicrometer MOSFETs. The 
P-MOSFETs fabricated show excellent device properties: smaller 
leakage, good I[.sub]d[/]-V[.sub]d[/] characteristics, 
shallow and uniform junction depth and smaller effect of lateral 
doping for drain and source. This doping technique is compatible 
with conventional MOS technology. Furthermore the equipment used 
is not very complicated and expensive, and the process is very 
simple. Therefore it is a very promising technique for 
fabrication of devices, especially for VLSI processing.
