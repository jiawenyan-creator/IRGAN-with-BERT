  [Abstract] Substance P (SP) and kindred peptides which form 
a family of the so-called tachykinins or neuroquinines and 
possess a broad range of biological activity, e.g., affect of 
the nonstriated muscle contractility, play the role 
neuromediators, participate in transmitting pain signals, and 
affect the level of classical neuromediators and cytokins, are 
discussed, and the need to clarify the structural-functional 
relationships of tachykinin receptors is emphasized. To this 
end, an attempt is made to establish the structure of the 
maximum possible number of proteins in this family, including 
human receptors. The emergence of the polymerase chain reaction 
method (PTsR or in vitro amplification) facilitates 
identification and makes it easier to establish the structure of 
genes belonging to one family. Success in isolating a kDNA human 
fragment with the help of polymerase chain reaction and primers 
synthesized on the basis of the NK-2 receptor gene nucleotide 
sequence from the bull intestine in using a human trachea mDNA 
is reported, and polymerase chain reaction is used to identify 
the substance P receptor gene (NK-1 receptor) in the human 
genome. Primer pairs whose nucleotide sequences are identical to 
conservative segments of DNA receptor areas of the rat brain 
substance P are synthesized, and the resulting polymerase chain 
reaction products are analyzed using electrophoresis. The 
resulting fragment is identical to the 771-864 fragment of the 
nucleotide sequence of the rat brain substance P receptor except 
for the G[.sup]796[/]A substitution, i.e., a ValIle 
substitution in the amino acid sequence. A comparison to 
published sources reveals that the established nucleotide 
sequence corresponds to tachykinin receptors and is a fragment 
of the substance P receptor gene. The authors are grateful to 
N.S. Bystrov for oligonucleotide probe synthesis. Figures 2;
