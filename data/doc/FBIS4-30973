  [Text] Belgrade, 1 Jun (TANJUG) -- The Federal Government 
received with indignation the news about a barbaric and 
terrorist act committed by an unidentified perpetrator who 
planted explosives at the entrance to a Catholic church in 
Subotica last night. The Federal Government most vehemently 
condemns this terrorist act as an obvious attempt to instigate 
unrest and cause divisions and distrust among citizens of the 
multiethnic town of Subotica. It also emphasizes its firm 
resolve in pursuing a policy of protection and strengthening of 
equality of all citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 
regardless of their nationality and religion. 
  The Federal Government will take energetic measures to find 
the unidentified perpetrator and establish his responsibility as 
soon as possible. The Federal Government stresses that there 
should be complete trust in the relevant state bodies, who will 
inform the public about the findings of their investigation and 
take the necessary measures to prevent further threats to 
religious facilities and ensure a peaceful life and security for 
the citizens.
