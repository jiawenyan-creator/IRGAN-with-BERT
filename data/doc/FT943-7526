FT  23 AUG 94 / Concern increases on late payments
The value of long-overdue debts has risen to an all-time high, figures
released yesterday by Trade Indemnity, the specialist trade credit insurer,
show.
The average value of the debts - those which are unpaid 30 days after they
are due - rose 5 per cent in the last quarter to Pounds 153,000, says the
insurer's quarterly financial trends survey.
On average, payments are made 22 days after a debt is due. Just 2 per cent
of companies are paid on time.
The number of exporters being paid on time increased slightly from 11 per
cent to 13 per cent between the first and second quarters of the year. A
quarter of companies said they had suffered no bad debts in the past 12
months, while 3 per cent said they had suffered bad debts totalling more
than 2 per cent of their turnover.
Mr William Simpson, chief economist at Trade Indemnity, said the rising
trend of long-overdue debt was 'of concern' and could reflect credit-control
systems being unable to keep pace with levels of activity.
However he said there was 'encouraging news' of higher levels of trade in
most business sectors and that in general the figures showed that the
economic recovery appeared to be progressing steadily in the second quarter.
The survey shows that 41 per cent of respondents were operating at between
75 per cent and 99 per cent of their optimum rate of business activity, up 2
per cent on the first quarter of the year.
It shows that many companies are being adversely affected by price increases
in raw materials and a shortage of skilled labour. All but one of the 18
industry sectors examined said that price discounting was eroding profits.
