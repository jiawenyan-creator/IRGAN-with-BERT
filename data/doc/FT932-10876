FT  06 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAT doubts
Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries fell sharply yesterday in spite
of first-quarter figures well above the consensus forecast. Turnover of 4.8m
shares was unusually heavy and the stock was the most actively traded in the
options market.
The group's shares dropped 23 to 850p, after it announced a profit of Pounds
360m, up by 40 per cent and some Pounds 10m above the average expectation.
However, tobacco trading profits of Pounds 220m were slightly below last
year's first quarter, yet represented the period before US rival Philip
Morris launched a cigarette price war. Also, Pounds 46m of the gains were
purely currency-related and it transpired that the latest IRA bomb in
central London will cost BAT around Pounds 25m. SG Warburg, which has taken
a dim view of the stock recently, maintains its full-year forecast of Pounds
1,828m, but believes dividend growth might hit 8 per cent and short-term
underperformance will be countered by a rally later in the year.
