FT  12 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont responds on Pilkington
MR NORMAN Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday played down the significance of
remarks attributed to a prominent British business executive accusing him of
'killing' domestic industry.
Mr Lamont said that he had had dinner last week with Sir Antony Pilkington -
the executive concerned - and that he had 'assured me he wholly supported
government policy.'
