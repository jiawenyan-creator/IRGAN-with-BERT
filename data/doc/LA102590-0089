ANGELS FIRE STUBING, BRING IN HINES, REBERGER AS COACHES 
Moose Stubing, who was a minor league coach and manager for the Angels before 
becoming their third base coach for nearly six years, was released Wednesday in 
a shuffling of scouts and coaches. 
Stubing, with the Angels' organization since 1968, most recently served as the 
Angels' first base coach after having been shifted from third base on Aug. 17. 
He was 0-8 as the interim manager in 1988 after Cookie Rojas was fired. 
Stubing will be replaced by Bruce Hines, who was a scout, rookie league manager 
and roving defensive instructor for the Angels. Hines is the son of Dodger 
batting instructor Ben Hines. 
Stubing, 52, could not be reached for comment. 
One-time major league pitcher Frank Reberger, formerly a roving minor league 
pitching instructor for the Angels, was named bullpen coach, succeeding Joe 
Coleman, who became pitching coach for the St. Louis Cardinals. 
The Angels also hired Bob Harrison, who was a major league special assignment 
scout for the Seattle Mariners, to perform the same role for them. 
Outfielder Max Venable filed for free agency Wednesday, one of 50 major league 
players to do so in the 15-day "window" after the World Series. Venable, who 
hit .259 in 93 games, had said before the season ended he that hoped to be 
re-signed.
