<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Karol Wolf </F>
on 15 March; place not given: "The New Slovak Government Wants 
To Orient Itself Toward the West"] 
  [Excerpts] Yesterday, Josef Moravcik, the new Slovak prime 
minister, granted an interview to MLADA FRONTA DNES, in which he 
described the concept of his government in the coming period, 
stressed the necessity of reviving Czech-Slovak relations, and 
indicated the unequivocal orientation of his country toward the 
West. 
  [Wolf] What steps will the new Slovak Cabinet have to take 
in the economic sphere? 
  [Moravcik] I cannot jump to premature conclusions. The 
government's program statement will provide an answer to this 
question, which is very specific. I realize that we will have 
to adopt certain measures. We will know what are the most 
important ones in about two days. 
  [Wolf] What are you going to do to improve Slovakia's image 
abroad? Specifically, to improve the tense Hungarian-Slovak 
relations? 
  [Moravcik] Regarding our relations with Hungary, I will push 
for signing a basic treaty between Hungary and Slovakia as soon 
as possible, even this year, if possible. This treaty should 
guarantee, among other things, the inviolability of the borders. 
I believe that the new government will be able to establish 
positive relations with foreign countries, particularly with the 
neighboring countries. We are going to lay stress on our 
integration into European economic and security structures, and 
I believe we will be able to convince Europe and the world that 
we are unequivocally heading toward the West. 
  [Wolf] How are you going to proceed in the matters that have 
remained unsolved between the Czech Republic and Slovakia--for 
example, the division of federal property and problems in 
defining the borders? 
  [Moravcik] I discussed these problems with Mr. Klaus and Mr. 
Zieleniec when I was foreign minister. I believe that there is 
a solid basis for our reaching an agreement. 
  [Wolf] Are you going to initiate a meeting with Klaus? 
  [Moravcik] I believe it will be inevitable. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Wolf] How are you going to guarantee the stability of your 
government? 
  [Moravcik] Stability is dependent on the consensus of the 
political parties. Entities that supported the no-confidence 
vote in Prime Minister Meciar are the guarantors of stability. 
  [Wolf] Stability is certainly dependent on the attitude of 
the Hungarian opposition. The Hungarian parties have certain 
demands. Are you able to meet them? 
  [Moravcik] In view of the temporary character of our 
government, we are able to meet only certain conditions. Above 
all, we will respect the Council of Europe resolution, which is 
an obligation that Slovakia has accepted.
