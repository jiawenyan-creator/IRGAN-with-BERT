FT  15 JAN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Good Food Festival
Jersey is planning a Good Food Festival from Saturday May 14 to Saturday May
21. And - I know you'll want to book now when you hear this - it is to
coincide with the opening of an orang-utan enclosure at the Jersey Wildlife
Preservation Trust. I haven't quite worked out why the two have been linked.
Monkey business at the island's tourist office?
