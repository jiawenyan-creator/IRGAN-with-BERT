FT  16 MAY 94 / Rover to introduce Sunday shift
Rover Group is to introduce Sunday working at its Longbridge plant near
Birmingham from next weekend to raise output of its 200/400 medium-size car
range.
The six-hour shift, to be worked by existing employees on overtime, is
intended to raise production by 5.5 per cent to 4,750 cars a week from
4,500.
Rover, which is owned by German carmaker BMW, said at the weekend that the
increased production is to meet higher demand in the UK and several large
continental markets. It also reflects a broadening of the model range to
include an estate car, the 400 Tourer, which is to go on sale next month.
The Longbridge plant, which also produces the Mini, Metro and engines and
gearboxes, at present makes 200s and 400s on a non-stop, 24-hour basis five
days a week.
Rover said that the Sunday shift would require about 1,000 of the 2,500
employees currently engaged in 200/400 assembly, all of whom had
volunteered.
The Sunday-working programme will continue until the annual summer holiday
shutdown at the start of August, when the situation will be reassessed.
Rover was the only carmaker to increase sales in western Europe's slumping
car market last year. In the first quarter of this year 200/400 sales rose
by 15 per cent in the UK to 23,302, and continental sales rose by a similar
amount to 35,574.
Rover has also increased production of its larger 600 model by 30 per cent
since the start of this year to 1,110 a week from 850. Last month the
four-wheel-drive subsidiary, Land Rover, announced it was creating 600 jobs
through an 8 per cent output rise - following a 20 per cent production
increase last year.
Total west European sales of 132,000 in the first four months of this year
were only 2,000 behind those of its BMW parent.
The first small saloon car to be produced by Rover since it was taken over
by BMW will be a model code-named R3 on a shortened Rover 200 body platform.
The new model will come on to the market in autumn 1995.
The ageing Metro will be given a facelift at the end of this year and the
200 series will be replaced next spring.
