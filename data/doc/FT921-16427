FT  03 JAN 92 / House prices fell in December
HOUSE prices fell by 1.2 per cent during December, Nationwide, Britain's
second biggest building society, reported yesterday.
That wiped out the previous month's modest rise and set the scene for a dull
new year in the homes market, Nationwide said. The average price of a house
fell Pounds 705 to Pounds 56,626 last month and is now 2.2 per cent below
the same period in 1990, it added.
