FT  11 JAN 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Gold leads precious
metals higher
GOLD LED precious metals prices into greener pastures this week after an
early fall revealed solid support below Dollars 350 a troy ounce.
A wave of investment fund selling, which started in Japan, was blamed for
Monday's Dollars 3.65 fall to a four-month low of Dollars 348.50 an ounce.
That did nothing for sentiment on the platinum market, which was also
suffering from worries about the US economy and the international motor
industry. The white metal's price tumbled Dollars 6.25 to Dollars 330.75 an
ounce, the lowest level for nearly seven years. Meanwhile silver lost 5.6
cents to close in London at 392 cents an ounce.
But that fall had pushed the gold market into a technically oversold
situation, and with good physical demand emerging the price first steadied
and then rose strongly, helped by US investment fund and Middle East buying.
By yesterday's close the price was Dollars 357.75 an ounce, up Dollars 5.60
on the week.
The more bullish sentiment naturally spilled over into the platinum market,
where news of a strike at Impala's Bafokeng North mine in South Africa added
to the upward momentum. Yesterday afternoon the London platinum price was
fixed at Dollars 341.75 an ounce, up Dollars 4.75 on the week.
Silver also joined in the fun, ending the week 12.50 cents up on balance at
412 cents an ounce.
At the London Metal exchange the aluminium market put in a stronger
performance, in spite of the continuing build-up in exchange warehouse
stocks, which last week passed the 1m-tonne mark. The cash price gained
another Dollars 6.50 yesterday to end Dollars 30 up on the week at Dollars
1,137 a tonne.
um's price rise had been dampened by a strengthening in the US dollar
towards the end of the week. But that factor helped to fuel a rally in the
LME's sterling-denominated copper contract.
A sharp fall in the first half of the week pushed the three months copper
price down to Pounds 1,140.50 a tonne, the lowest level since August 1988,
before the trend was reversed on Wednesday by news that a strike was
threatened by miners in Chile, the world's biggest copper producer, in
protest at government privatisation plans.
The three months price closed yesterday at Pounds 1,203.75 a tonne, up
Pounds 24 on the week. That was Pounds 63.25 up from Wednesday's low, but in
terms of the US currency the rally amounted to a much more modest Dollars
32.50.
The nickel market continued to be buoyed this week by talk of production
cuts by Falconbridge of Canada, despite the announcement of a sizeable rise
in LME warehouse stocks. The cash price closed yesterday at Dollars 77,320 a
tonne, up Dollars 142.50 on the week but Dollars 35 below the seven-week
high reached on Monday.
Zinc prices began and ended the week with sharp falls, but rises in between
meant that the cash price ended only Dollars 8.50 lower on balance at
Dollars 1,136.50 a tonne. Price movements mainly reflected the ebb and flow
of the fears about nearby supply tightness that had been boosting values in
recent weeks. This was highlighted by the fluctuations in the cash premium
over three months metal, which peaked at Dollars 37.50 a tonne on Thursday
before ending at the week's low of Dollars 28.50. Early last week this
premium, known as the 'backwardation', reached Dollars 59.50 a tonne.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange the coffee market was another
beneficiary of the dollar's strength. The March delivery price ended Pounds
41 up on the week at Pounds 566 a tonne, but the currency factor accounted
for about Pounds 13.50 of that rise. The rest was attributed to what dealers
described as 'a generally constructive mood' and concern over nearby supply
tightness. The latter factor resulted in the January position's Pounds 3
discount against March turning into a Pounds 10 premium during the course of
the week.
The cocoa market rallied strongly yesterday after being on the slide for
most of the week. The May position's Pounds 22 rise on the day, which
traders said was 'a bit of a correction' to an oversold position, left the
price Pounds 2 up on the week at Pounds 760 a tonne. But after allowing for
the currency factor that worked out as a Pounds 17.50 fall.
A rise in sugar futures prices was trimmed in mid-week after FO Licht, the
German statistics agency, cut its estimate of 1991-92 world output by a
smaller amount than traders had been expecting. But in late trading
yesterday nearby values were still about Dollars 2 up from the end of last
week.
