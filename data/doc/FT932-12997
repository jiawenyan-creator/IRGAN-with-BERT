FT  26 APR 93 / Insider dealing change backed
LABOUR is to support the campaign for changes to the government's Criminal
Justice Bill to ensure that the offence of insider dealing is not defined
too broadly.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, said: 'I have yet to be
persuaded it will do anyone any good to create a large class of potential
insiders who are doing no more than commentating on and analysing a
company's likely results.'
The bill, designed to implement a European Community insider-dealing
directive, would, as drafted, make it an offence not only to deal on the
basis of inside information but also to take advantage of such information
by disclosing it or by encouraging others to trade.
This has prompted concern in the City that analysts and brokers could fall
foul of the law in the course of their normal day-to-day activities.
The bill recently received its second Commons reading. A committee of MPs
who will carry out the bill's line-by-line committee stage scrutiny is due
to be chosen this week.
Labour will link the issue to its drive to encourage companies to disclose
information more readily. It argues that the proposed legislation could
create a 'black market' in information and lead to more criminal activity,
rather than less.
'The best weapon against insider dealing is openness,' said Mr Darling. 'The
brokers' lunch ought to be a thing of the past.'
Mr Darling will also use the committee stage to make clear that Labour will
demand an overhaul of the Financial Services Act as its price for backing
the establishment of a professional regulatory body to deal with misconduct
falling short of insider trading under the civil code.
