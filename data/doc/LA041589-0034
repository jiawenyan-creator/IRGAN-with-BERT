SHAMIR REJECTS TRADING LAND FOR PEACE 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Friday he rejects trading land for peace 
despite an earlier government statement that Israel is willing to discuss any 
option with the Palestinians. 
"I don't accept it. It is not necessary. It is not relevant," he told reporters 
upon his return to Israel from the United States. 
Shamir, 73, described his 10-day U.S. visit as a success and added: "There is 
an understanding between the U.S. and Israel about our four-point peace 
initiative." 
Shamir met last week with President Bush, who supported Shamir's idea for 
elections in the occupied territories but said the United States could not 
accept permanent Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
Shamir's plan offers elections to choose representatives from the occupied 
territories to negotiate an interim settlement with Israel. 
Several West Bank Palestinians reportedly have offered a counterproposal that 
residents elect members of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Palestine 
National Council instead of representatives for talks with Israel.
