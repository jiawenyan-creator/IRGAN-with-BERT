FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Petrocan to sell 37% stake in
Westcoast
PETRO-CANADA, the partially privatised Canadian energy group, is further
rationalising its activities by selling its 37 per cent stake in Westcoast
Energy, the Vancouver-based pipeline operator and natural gas producer.
Petrocan said yesterday a group of securities dealers, led by ScotiaMcLeod,
had agreed to buy the Westcoast shares for CDollars 342m (USDollars 285.59m)
or CDollars 16.25 a share. The price will be paid in two near-equal
instalments. Petrocan is Westcoast's largest single shareholder.
The proceeds will be used to reduce Petrocan's CDollars 1.5bn debt. But the
company expects to post a CDollars 54m after-tax charge from the sale
against third-quarter earnings.
Petrocan first bought a stake in Westcoast shortly after its creation in the
mid-1970s as Canada's national energy company. It augmented its holdings in
1988.
The Canadian government sold 20 per cent of its stake in Petrocan to the
public in July 1991. The stricter disciplines required of a publicly traded
company coupled with the recent slump in the domestic oil industry have
forced Petrocan to take a narrower focus.
It has sold numerous oil and gas producing properties in the past year and
is rationalising its service station network.
Petrocan's share price rose 50 cents to CDollars 8.13 after yesterday's
announcement, but remains well below last year's flotation price of CDollars
13.
Westcoast earned CDollars 53.9m on sales of CDollars 784m in the first half
of this year. It has a 3,000-mile network of natural gas pipelines serving
British Columbia, the US Northwest and California. It also produces oil and
natural gas, and has interests in gas distribution and sulphur production.
