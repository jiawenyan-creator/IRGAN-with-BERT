Pulsed High-Power Lasers''] 
  [Summary] This series of LPE-grown 
multilayer-heterostructure large-optical-cavity IR laser diodes, 
with wavelengths in the 8500-8700 angstrom range, have 
efficiencies of 50-60 percent. Maximum single-device power is 
2-3 W (at 4A-5A), while peak pulsed power of diode arrays is 100 
W. Threshold current (density) is 2 mA/cm[.sup]2[/], and 
equivalent series resistance is 0.6-0.8 ohm. The series, which 
received a CAS S&amp;T advancement award in 1990, is superior to 
the 
foreign-made LD60 product, and meets mid-to-late-80s 
international standards. These laser diodes are used in 
military firing simulators, missile laser fuses, 
remote-controlled detonators, security alarm systems, laser 
guidance units, and military night-vision equipment.
