FT  10 AUG 92 / O&amp;Y's banks may seize US property cashflow
A BANKING group led by JP Morgan and Bank of Montreal has threatened legal
action to seize the cashflow - rental income - from six Olympia &amp; York
office buildings in New York and Los Angeles amid signs of mounting creditor
impatience with the troubled Canadian property developer. The buildings,
which include two towers of the World Financial Centre, were pledged as
collateral for a Dollars 160m (Pounds 84m) loan provided by the group to
O&amp;Y.
O&amp;Y's operations in Canada and the UK have been under bankruptcy protection
since May, but the company has so far kept creditors of its US buildings at
bay. Lenders have been dissuaded from legal action fearing that they stand
to lose more through bankruptcy proceedings than an orderly debt
restructuring.
The JP Morgan-led move is seen as the most serious threat so far. The
dispute stems from a decision by O&amp;Y earlier this year to pledge a portion
of the World Financial Centre's cashflow to Japanese institutional lenders
in return for an agreement to defer interest payments on their Dollars 800m
loan. The Morgan group has urged O&amp;Y to make principal payments on its loan,
or to segregate cashflow from the six buildings in bank accounts supervised
by the lenders.
O&amp;Y remains confident it can restructure the debt of its US operations
without seeking court protection.
