FT  07 APR 93 / Gateway protected from all but Pounds 464m of Isosceles debt
THE TROUBLED Gateway food retailing chain is to be ring-fenced from all but
Pounds 464m of the Pounds 1.4bn borrowing obligations of its parent
Isosceles as part of a restructuring announced yesterday. Under the terms of
the deal, Gateway Foodmarkets is to be managed through a newly created
holding company, Gateway Holdings.
It will assume responsibility for Pounds 500m of Isosceles' borrowings, of
which Pounds 464m will be drawn at completion of the restructuring. No
repayment will be due on this debt until 1998.
Gateway will also have a Pounds 50m two-year working capital facility.
Isosceles, formed in 1989 through a Pounds 2bn leveraged buy-out, is to have
its remaining debt of Pounds 923m restructured. The deal has to be approved
by all of the group's 38 banks by the end of May. Mr David Simons, chief
executive of Isosceles, said: 'We had to reach an agreement otherwise we
would have been fighting over a carcass rather than a living body. The deal
has lifted Pounds 1bn burden from our shoulders.'
The Gateway assets, which will continue to be owned by Isosceles, may be
floated in three to five years. They are valued at around Pounds 800m after
Pounds 150m of write-downs. Mr Simons said the restructuring would be
accompanied with a 'clean-out' of Isosceles' balance sheet.
Gateway is expected to report a pre-tax loss of more than Pounds 300m for
the financial year ending this month after what Mr Simons called 'kitchen
sink provisions' covering the restructuring.
The banks face heavy losses on the remaining Isosceles debt as it is
restructured into Pounds 256m of senior facilities, Pounds 400m of deep
discount bonds and Pounds 267m of new Isosceles preference shares. Holders
of the bank debt will receive Pounds 196m of the senior facility, Pounds
267m of the bonds and Pounds 125m of preference shares and all Gateway's
debt.
Mezzanine holders are to get Pounds 60m of the senior debt, Pounds 133m of
the bonds and Pounds 142m of the preference shares. Existing dividend and A
ordinary shares are to be converted into ordinary shares.
Existing shareholders will own 45 per cent of the enlarged share capital and
mezzanine and senior lenders will own 45 per cent and 10 per cent
respectively.
A special share will be issued to the senior lenders giving them 51 per cent
of the votes at a general meeting.
