FT  13 SEP 93 / IG Metall plans its pay target
GERMANY'S engineering workers will be calling for a wage rise next year
limited to the rate of inflation, plus any increase in productivity,
according to Mr Klaus Zwickel, acting leader of IG Metall, the country's
largest trade union, Quentin Peel writes.
The move is seen as a clear indication by the union of the need for wage
restraint because of the downturn in the German economy. But it still falls
well short of the employers' insistence on a 'zero round' in next year's
most important wage round.
The first indication of the union's position - without any precise figures
for either its inflation or productivity estimates - was presented by Mr
Zwickel in Frankfurt as a 'peace offering' intended to take the heat out of
the coming pay talks. Formal wage demands have to be drawn up by the end of
November.
At the same time, he called for a joint initiative by both workers and
employers in the engineering industry, the sector of the German economy hit
hardest by the recession, to demand new government initiatives to counteract
rising unemployment, including an accelerated programme of infrastructural
investment in east Germany.
His plea met a sceptical response from Gesamtmetall, the engineering
employers' federation. A spokesman said the industry needed a freeze on
costs in the coming year. He said IG Metall still failed to recognise that
German wage costs were too high and undermined German competitiveness.
