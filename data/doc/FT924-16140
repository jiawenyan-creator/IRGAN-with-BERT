FT  01 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Hurd soft-pedals on Maastricht
MR DOUGLAS HURD, British foreign secretary, said yesterday that the UK did
not intend to propose alterations or amendments to the Maastricht treaty at
the summit on Europe's future in Birmingham in mid-October.
However, he made clear at a news conference in Bonn after talks with Mr
Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, that he did not rule out unspecified
'additions' to the treaty.
Mr Hurd will today offer a vigorous defence of the Maastricht agreement,
coupled with a warning that the UK's interests are unlikely to be as
well-served without the treaty, when he addresses a meeting in London
organised by the European Policy Forum, a think-tank.
In a speech which will set the UK government's line of argument in the
coming months, Mr Hurd is expected to argue that Maastricht represents the
opposite of a blueprint for a federal Europe.
'We must listen to what voices across Europe are saying about the Maastricht
treaty,' Mr Hurd said.
The UK government is warning its domestic critics that abandoning the
agreement could jeopardise UK interests in other parts of the EC agenda such
as the completion of the single market, enlargement and the legitimacy of
inter-governmental agreements as a basis for co-operation.
The argument will be strengthened by the message from German leaders, that
enlargement would not be possible unless Maastricht is accepted.
In a joint appearance after the meeting, the foreign ministers agreed that
the recent tensions between the two governments would not damage the
fundamental good relationship they have.
