FT  15 SEP 94 / Virgin launches branded goods
You've flown the airline, shopped at the megastores and played the computer
games. Now buy the consumer goods.
Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group is launching a range of fast-moving
consumer goods bearing the Virgin name. Virgin Retail Brands, a new company
to develop the products, will be registered today.
The company aims to have a number of goods in the shops by Christmas. The
first is likely to be Virgin Vodka, and Virgin is already negotiating with
William Grant, the spirits group, about a product launch in the next few
months. Another plan is for mineral water, under the name Virgin Spring.
Virgin said: 'This is a big departure for us. Apart from the Body Shop,
Virgin is the only new international brand to come out of Britain in the
last couple of decades that has recognition in three continents. But we
don't use it in any form of hard products that people can pick up.'
Recent research suggested the Virgin name was sufficiently well-regarded and
recognised to enable it to expand beyond its present niche markets.
Commercial director of Virgin Retail Brands will be Mr Nick Roslin, who
developed in-flight retailing on Virgin Atlantic airlines. Mr James Kydd,
formerly a director of advertising agency Coleman RSCG, will be responsible
for advertising, marketing and brand development. Mr John Jackson, former
managing director of Body Shop, will be a consultant and may later take a
management position.
Virgin plans to develop innovative products that have a leisure connotation,
such as snacks and soft drinks.
