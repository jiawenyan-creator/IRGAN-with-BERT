 Notice.





Notice is hereby given that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intends to conduct a recurring computer matching
program matching Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) benefit recipient records with VA pension and parents' dependency
and indemnity compensation records.

The goal of this match is to compare income status as reported to VA with benefit records maintained by RRB.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) plans to match records of veterans and surviving spouses and children who
receive pension and parents who receive dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) from VA with Railroad Retirement
benefit records maintained by RRB. The match with RRB will provide VA with data from the RRB Research File of Retirement
and Survivor Benefits.

VA will use the data to update the master records of VA beneficiaries receiving income dependent benefits and to adjust
VA benefit payments as prescribed by law. Currently, information about a VA beneficiary's receipt of RRB benefits
is obtained from reporting by the beneficiary. The proposed matching program will enable VA to ensure accurate reporting
of income.
