FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Scottish merchant bank seeks quotation
QUAYLE MUNRO, the small Edinburgh merchant bank, is to be quoted on the
Stock Exchange after a reverse takeover by East of Scotland Industrial
Investments, the unquoted investment company which it manages.
ESII has net worth of about Pounds 17m, of which Pounds 8.5m is in cash. The
deal involves repayment of about Pounds 10m of ESII's capital to its
shareholders, who are mainly institutions.
Existing Quayle Munro shareholders will end up owning 75 per cent of the
newly merged company, which will be called Quayle Munro Holdings. It will
seek a full listing immediately the transaction is completed in early June.
The new company will have a market capitalisation of Pounds 6m to Pounds 7m.
No new shares will be issued.
Mr Ian Jones, who founded Quayle Munro in 1983 with Mr Michael Munro, will
be group chief executive. He said the transaction was a means of enabling
shareholders in ESII to realise their investment without suffering a
discount on net asset value.
The new company will be primarily a corporate finance adviser, though it
will also make occasional investments.
ESII has shares in two listed companies, Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste disposal
company, and Secure Trust Group. It also has stakes in 16 unquoted
companies, such as Exacta Holdings, an electronics group, and Nevis Range
Development, which operates skiing facilities near Fort William in the
Scottish Highlands.
Quayle Munro has a number of corporate clients including Shanks &amp; McEwan and
Pittencrieff, the oil company.
It has also advised the Scottish Office on privatising the Scottish Bus
Group and on the future of the Scottish water industry.
