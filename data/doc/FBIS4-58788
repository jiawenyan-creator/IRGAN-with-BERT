  [Text] Brother President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], 
president of the state of Palestine and chairman of the PLO 
Executive Committee, met the night before last with the members 
of the Palestinian leadership in the PLO Executive Committee and 
the Central Committee of Fatah, the largest PLO faction. The 
meeting was devoted to discussing preparations to assume 
self-rule authority in Gaza and Jericho. 
  This meeting was a continuation of the one between brother 
Abu-'Ammar and the Palestinian leadership. These meetings are 
meant to prepare the final composition of the council of the 
National Authority, chaired by brother President Abu-'Ammar. 
The council includes 12 members from the occupied territories 
and 12 others from outside. The meetings are also discussing 
the formations of the institutions that will assume self-rule in 
Gaza and Jericho. 
  Meanwhile, it was announced in Tunis that five PLO Executive 
Committee members will be members of the Palestinian National 
Authority, which will include 24 personalities. Brother 
President Abu-'Ammar is holding intensive consultations to form 
this body. 
  AFP reported that the members of the PLO Executive Committee 
who will assume posts in the forthcoming authority are: 
  Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, for the Palestinian Democratic Union; 
Samir Ghawshah, for the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front; and 
three independent personalities: Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, 
Yasir 'Amr, and Jawid al-Ghusayn. 
  The Fatah Central Committee, led by brother President 
Abu-'Ammar, had earlier appointed five of its members to assume 
positions in the authority. Half of the members of the 
authority are from outside the occupied territories; the other 
half are from inside. 
  Sources close to Fatah said the five are: Nabil Sha'th, 
Ahmad Quray', and Intisar al-Wazir from outside; and Faysal 
al-Husayni and Zakariya al-Agha from inside.
