FIRE DAMAGES NORTHRIDGE CLUB 
A fire that started this morning in the bar area of a closed Northridge 
nightclub caused an estimated $350,000 in damages, the Los Angeles Fire 
Department reported. 
There were no injuries during the fire that was reported at 3:45 a.m. at 
Fantasia West Nightclub in the 19000 block of Nordhoff Street, across the 
street from the Northridge Mall, Firefighter Pat Marek said. 
Marek said about 40 firefighters contained the blaze in half an hour. The cause 
of the fire is under investigation. 
The flames were believed to have started behind or near a bar that served a 
raised seating area in the rear of the nightclub, Marek said. Much of the 
damage was confined to that area and a nearby storage area, he said.
