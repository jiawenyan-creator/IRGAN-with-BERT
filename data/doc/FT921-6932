FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: AMD wins ruling over chips
licence
IN A decision with broad consequences for the computer and semiconductor
industries, a California arbitrator has affirmed Advanced Micro Devices'
rights to continue to manufacture and market its own version of Intel's top
selling product, the 386 microprocessor.
The decision follows a five-year product licensing dispute between two of
the leading US semiconductor manufacturers, focussed upon AMD's claim that
Intel should have transferred its 386 design to AMD under a licensing
agreement between the companies.
The arbitrator ruled that AMD failed to produce products of equivalent
technical value in order to earn the rights to Intel's 386, and said that
Intel should not be forced to transfer the technology. Nonetheless, he ruled
that AMD should have the rights to manufacture and market its own version of
the 386 microprocessor. Intel disputed the licence portion of the decision,
claiming that the arbitrator has acted beyond his powers. AMD had also been
seeking Dollars 2.2 bn in damages from Intel. However, the arbitrator
awarded AMD only Dollars 15m.
