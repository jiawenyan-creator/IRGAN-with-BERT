METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ARMENIANS BLOCK ENTRY TO RED ARMY 
PERFORMANCE 
A group of about 1,000 chanting Armenian demonstrators blocked the entrances to 
Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium on Thursday evening, delaying a concert by the 
175-member Soviet Red Army Chorus and dance ensemble for more than two hours. 
"We're trying to bring to public attention that the Red Army, instead of 
protecting its citizens, is firing on people," said Berdj Karapetian, a 
spokesman for the Armenia National Committee, one of two groups protesting 
Thursday. 
Rather than confront the demonstrators, police began escorting about 900 
ticket-holders into the auditorium through a side door shortly after 10 p.m. 
Several said protesters had pushed and shoved them as they stood in line to buy 
tickets for the 8 p.m. show. 
"I'm really aggravated," said Pat Radowitz, one ticket-holder. "I believe in 
freedom of speech, but I also believe in my right to see a concert." 
Police reported shouting matches between demonstrators and people trying to 
enter the auditorium for the show. No one was injured. 
The chorus was scheduled to appear in the United States in 1939 but was delayed 
for 50 years because of World War II, the Cold War and years of East-West 
tensions. 
Thursday's performance was the first of four scheduled for Los Angeles through 
the weekend. 
As the ticket-holders entered the side door, police declared an unlawful 
assembly and moved into the crowd of demonstrators, who dispersed peacefully.
