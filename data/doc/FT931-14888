FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: First Spanish net asset value lower
A sudden downturn in the property and construction sectors at a time when
those sectors had been over-weighted in its portfolio left net asset value
at First Spanish Investment Trust at 67.5p at November 30.
That represented a fall of 14 per cent from the 78.6p of six months earlier.
At November 30 1991 nav was 72.2p.
The company said that with the peseta at a more competitive level the omens
for the Spanish stock market, which was undervalued compared with other
European markets, appeared favourable.
Net revenue for the six months to the end of November was Pounds 293,000
(Pounds 270,000) for earnings per share of 0.83p (0.76p).
The main objective of the trust is capital appreciation and no interim
dividend will be paid. However, it intended to propose a final dividend for
the year to May 31, the first payment since that for the 1989-90 year.
