FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Westpac sells stake in ANZ for
ADollars 215m
WESTPAC Banking Corporation, the troubled Australian bank, has continued its
asset-sale programme by selling its once-strategic 6.1 per cent stake in the
rival ANZ Banking Group for just over ADollars 215m (USDollars 144.9m).
Westpac confirmed completion of the sale yesterday after the bank's brokers
began the selling task in New York on Friday night.
The bank has sold a total of 77.5m ANZ shares to a range of Australian and
overseas institutions.
The shares were sold at ADollars 2.905 each, yielding a small profit on
Westpac's book valuation of ADollars 2.88 following a big write-down last
year.
Westpac's major shareholder, the AMP Society, also revealed yesterday it had
sold just under 1m ANZ shares, but retained a stake of 5.71 per cent.
The ANZ sales come amid speculation that further leading bank mergers may be
allowed if the Liberal-National Party coalition wins Australia's federal
election, scheduled for March 13.
Westpac also announced last night it had sold its entire 7.6 per cent stake
in the Bank of Melbourne, a small Australian trading bank.
