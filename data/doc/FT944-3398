FT  13 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Focus on MAM
Expectation of a tussle for SG Warburg sharpened the focus on the merchant
banking sector as investors latched on to any nuance coming out of the
proposed link with Morgan Stanley of the US.
Yesterday, interest was concentrated on Mercury Asset Management (MAM) the
fund management company 75 per cent owned by Warburg. Speculation that MAM's
minority shareholders would demand a preferential price for their stake to
reflect the contribution MAM makes to the group's overall capitalisation saw
the fund mangement arm's shares leap 39 to 750p.
Meanwhile Warburg gained 10 to 793p as most investors refused to believe
that an agreed bid would go ahead at current levels - particularly when the
shares hit Pounds 10 apiece earlier in the year. Nevertheless sellers
emerged on the grounds that any bad feeling from MAM could upset a deal that
would need complete mutual agreement.
Elsewhere, the hunt is on for other merger or takeover candidates as some
dealers excitedly predict Big Bang, phase two. Smith New Court jumped 24 to
444p and Kleinwort Benson 16 to 553p.
Mobile phones group Vodafone moved marginally ahead against the market in
12m turnover, finishing at 193 1/2 p. Recently floated TeleWest
Communications dipped below its 182p issue price, closing a penny lower at
181p in 2.5m turnover. Building materials group Caradon came under clear
pressure as part of a wider run against the construction sector on the back
of interest rate fears. Caradon shed 13 1/2 to 230p while housebuilder
Barratt Development tumbled 10 to 141p.
The latest setback pushes Caradon's market capitalisation down to less than
Pounds 1.4bn and to a level that leaves the group bumping along at the
bottom of the Footsie rankings.
Revived speculation that De La Rue, the bank note printer, was poised to
make an offer for Portals, the specialist paper maker, motivated the share
prices of the two groups.
Portals shares were up 60 at one stage on a Sunday newspaper report that the
chairman had met De La Rue's chief executive over the weekend. The stock
closed 41 higher at 874p while De La Rue fell 16 to 929p.
Paper manufacturer Arjo Wiggins Appleton lost 8 at 251p after SG Warburg
became a seller of stock. The house also downgraded David S. Smith, which
fell 20 to 498p.
Reports that UBS had turned negative on the property sector together with
fears of another rise in UK interest rates sent shares in the sector into
retreat. MEPC fell 17 1/4 to 358p xd and Land Securities fell 13 to 547p, in
trade of 3.3m while British Land eased 2 to 361p, and Hammerson relinquished
2 to 310p.
Asda Group were in demand ahead of interim figures on Thursday. The shares
edged a  1/4 forward to 65p. Turnover in several stocks in the sector was
boosted by programme trades. Volume in Budgens rose to 48m though the shares
closed unchanged at 25p. Heavy volume of 41m was also seen in Park Food. It
too closed unchanged at 122p. An agency cross in Tesco brought volume of 7m.
The shares added a penny to 237p.
Stores group House of Fraser edged forward a half to 183p, following a
recommendation from NatWest Securities. Advising investors to add to
holdings, NatWest said, 'House of Fraser has all the necessary ingredients
to engineer a recovery and the strategy is already delivering encouraging
results.'
However, the securities house downgraded current year profit expectations by
Pounds 6m to Pounds 40m, and the following year's figure by Pounds 8m to
Pounds 51m.
Football club Manchester United firmed a penny to 615p ahead of this
morning's four-for-one scrip issue which will see the share price divided by
five at the outset.
Food manufacturer Hillsdown Holdings benefited from visits to institutions,
adding 2 to 175p.
SmithKline Beecham shed 4 to 423 1/2 p as the company held an international
conference call.
Rival Wellcome dropped 13 to 655p. Dealers cited a US news report alleging
possible write-downs by the company.
Pharmaceuticals group Proteus International fell 45 to 195p in response to a
lengthy and critical Sunday newspaper article.
British Aerospace moved ahead strongly against the market following the
cancellation of the second stage of a Pounds 535m rights issue, rising 4 1/2
to 427p in 1.1m turnover.
