FT  08 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Japanese premier 'ready' for deal on rice
Japan's prime minister indicated yesterday that his government was ready to
accept a compromise on opening its rice market to imports.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa said Japan, which benefited from the world's free trade
system, needed to bear a proportional burden. His comments increased the
tensions within his seven-party coalition, which includes the Social
Democratic party which depends heavily on the farming vote, which wants to
keep import restrictions.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the SDP, reaffirmed the party's opposition
to the partial lifting of the rice ban. Some hardliners within the party
have been threatening to leave the coalition if the import ban is lifted.
The SDP, the largest member of the coalition, will officially decide its
policy tomorrow, before the Japanese government's formal announcement on
Friday.
Mr Hosokawa's remarks yesterday were in response to a draft proposal by
Gatt's market access negotiators.
It allows a six-year grace period on tarification of rice imports, on
condition Japan allows minimum access of 4 to 8 per cent of domestic
consumption during the period.
Whether the special treatment will be continued after the moratorium period
is subject to negotiation a year before the period ends.
In spite of the outcry from farmers' associations, the business community,
which faces constant overseas pressure over Japan's mounting trade surplus,
applauded the decision to lift the symbolic trade barrier. Farmers and
students fought riot police in the South Korean capital yesterday as tens of
thousands protested against a government U-turn which would allow rice
imports, Reuter reports from Seoul.
Some protesters attacked police lines with sticks and iron bars while
shouting slogans against talks in Geneva between South Korean and US
officials which are expected to lead to liberalisation of the rice trade.
