  [Text] Zagreb, April 28 (AFP) -- The UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] is worried by growing tension in Brcko, north-east 
Bosnia, one of the main hotspots in the war-torn country, an 
UNPROFOR spokesman said Thursday [28 April]. "Brcko is an area 
of concern to us. It's something we are looking at very 
closely," Matthew Nerzig said. 
  There has been no serious outbreak of fighting to date but 
Brcko remains "a general area of tension, a possible 
flashpoint," the UN spokesman went on. Since the Serb 
withdrawal from Gorazde, eastern Bosnia, earlier this week, NATO 
and UN sources have expressed worries that the Serbs might 
attack in Brcko in order to widen the corridor linking the 
territories they control in Croatia and Bosnia with the rump 
Yugoslavia. For the moment, there is nothing to suggest that 
the Serbs have moved their heavy weapons north, the UNPROFOR 
spokesman said. 
  "There is no indication that the weapons that have been 
withdrawn out of the Gorazde area are moving all together in a 
consolidated, unified combat form to some other location." 
However, there are practical difficulties for the UN in 
attempting to cover the situation in Brcko where it has no 
military observers at present. The Serbs have to date objected 
to any UN presence. The 50 UN military observers deployed in 
areas controlled by the Serbs -- out of a total of 256 in the 
whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- are still subject to varying 
degrees of restrictions on their movements. "In some areas it 
is quite restricted but in others, such as Sarajevo, the freedom 
of movement is much better," Nerzig said. 
  Serb forces held dozens of UN personnel hostage for over a 
week immediately after the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation 
launched air strikes on April 10 and 11 against the Serbs 
attacking Gorazde.
