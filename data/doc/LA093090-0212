U.S. TROOPS UNDER A U.N. COMMANDER? 
Published reports citing anonymous sources multiply, saying President Bush and 
his team want to work through the United Nations on a solution to the gulf 
crisis -- seeking a Security Council authorization for military action under 
Article 42 of the U.N. charter. No action has been so taken since June, 1950, 
when the Security Council -- then boycotted by the Soviet Union -- authorized 
military force to turn back the invasion of South Korea. 
But 1990 is light years from 1950. Today, a war under U.N. auspices would 
almost surely involve a degree of U.N. control and a U.N. commander who would 
be more attentive than the United States to the sensibilities of countries in 
the region (because that is the way the United Nations works). 
Could the United States, which has far more troops in the gulf than any other 
country, accept international control of its forces? Indeed, has the U.S. 
President the legal power to relinquish command of American troops to U.N. 
control? Is the authorization of Congress required for the President to 
delegate that control? 
If the Bush Administration relies on the Security Council to authorize the use 
of force, will it delegate to the Security Council the power to set the terms 
for ending such a war? 
In considering the options, Bush and his advisers will surely remember that, 
while a President may be able to delegate control over a war, he cannot 
delegate the responsibility. 
It was the President who responded in force to Iraq's invasion. It was he who 
dispatched 100,000 American troops and rallied an international coalition in 
support of this action. It was he who invested U.S. power and reputation in the 
gulf. And it is he who will be praised or blamed by the American people for its 
outcome.
