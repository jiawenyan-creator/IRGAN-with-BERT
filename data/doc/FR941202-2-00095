I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Phlx, pursuant to rule 19b4 of the Act, proposes to extend the close of trading on the Exchange's equity trading
floor from 4:00 to 4:15 P.M., creating a new Post Primary session (``PPS''). The PPS would take place each trading day
from 4:00 to 4:15 P.M. Exchange rules applicable to floor trading during the Exchange's regular trading hours (

i.e.

, 9:30 a.m.4:00 p.m.) would continue to apply to floor trading during the PPS, except that during the PPS, orders
that are designated ``PPS'' are eligible for execution. Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to amend the following
Phlx rules: Rule 101, adding Commentary .02 to specify equity floor trading hours; Rule 229, Commentary .17, adding
reference to implementing the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Automated Communication and Execution System (``PACE'')
as a routing system only, with Floor Procedure Committee approval; Rule 232 to add the PPS as well as opening before
the primary market; and Equity Floor Procedure Advice EF1, which provides the procedures for the designation
and execution of orders in instances where the primary market is not open in an issue for which the Phlx is open, to change
the eligibility designation from use of the yellow copy of the order ticket to the designator ``EXP'' and to make several
clarifications. The text of the proposed rule change is available in full at the Commission Public Reference Room.
