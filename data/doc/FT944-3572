FT  13 DEC 94 / IBM loses law suit over computer upgrade market
IBM yesterday lost another round in its nine-year battle against an
anti-trust law suit brought by a competitor in the US market for overhauling
and upgrading mainframe computers.
The US Supreme Court refused to review a decision by the federal appeals
court in Philadelphia that overturned an earlier verdict in IBM's favour and
ordered a new trial of the anti-trust case.
The suit was brought against IBM by Allen-Myland, which claimed that IBM had
abused its dominant position in the market by manipulating the price of
parts and in effect illegally tying customers to using its own upgrading
services.
Allen-Myland said that this shut it out of the upgrade market, which at
times in the 1970s was as large as the market for new mainframes.
Allen-Myland at one point accounted for half the upgrades performed on IBM
mainframes.
The Philadelphia appeals court overturned the lower court ruling in IBM's
favour on the grounds that the judge had erred in his definition of the size
of the market in which Allen-Myland claimed IBM was holding a dominant
position.
The new decision could have ramifications for IBM's efforts to escape from
the terms of a consent decree which it negotiated in 1956 with President
Eisenhower's Justice Department. This required IBM to stop offering its
computers for lease only, rather than outright sale, and to separate its
service business from its manufacturing.
Although IBM is clearly no longer dominant in the broadest definition of the
US computer market (it slipped this year to fourth place in sales of
personal computers), the issue of whether it still dominates the mainframe
market could depend on a precise definition of that market.
