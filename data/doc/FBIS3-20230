  [Text] Speaking to Lebanese journalists in Paris 
yesterday, Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri said that he does not 
perceive any change in French policy toward Lebanon. The prime 
minister said Lebanon is not a commodity to be sold or bought. 
He noted that there is a feeling that Lebanon needs to develop 
national unity and strengthen domestic stability. It must 
consider building the state as a basic requirement. 
  Prime Minister al-Hariri affirmed that there is no fear for 
civil liberties in Lebanon. He said: We want greater openness 
toward the press through a reconsideration of Legislative Decree 
No. 104. We do not wish to silence the media. Lebanon will 
lose everything unless it maintains its status as a democratic 
and free country. All Lebanese are against anarchy. We have 
adopted all the necessary measures to consolidate the situation, 
because there are attempts to undermine the situation in the 
country. 
  Lebanon will face a greater challenge in times of peace 
because Israel views it as its primary economic competitor. He 
said that the purpose of the attempts to undermine Lebanon's 
independence is to weaken its position in the negotiations, 
particularly as 10 percent of its territory is still under 
Israeli occupation. Israel, he said, is trying to improve its 
negotiating position.
