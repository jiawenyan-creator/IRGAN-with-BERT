FT  19 MAR 93 / Upturn continues to elude motor industry: Car output
'disappoints SMMT
THE UK motor industry is still looking in vain for the production upturn it
has forecast for this year.
Car output fell 2.3 per cent and commercial vehicle output 15.73 per cent in
February compared with the corresponding period a year ago, a performance
described yesterday as 'disappointing' by Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of
the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
Statistics issued jointly by the SMMT and Central Statistical Office showed
car output falling to 110,844 units from 114,192 in February last year.
Production for export rose 4.4 per cent to 49,206 from 47,130. Output for
the domestic market fell 8.2 per cent to 61,638 from 67,062.
Most analysts expect about 10 per cent growth in the severely depressed UK
market this year, and production is gathering pace at Toyota's plant at
Burnaston, Derbyshire, and at Honda's at Swindon, Wiltshire. Nissan also has
plans to expand output of its Sunderland plant this year.
The growth of output for export may be constrained by a swift and severe
downturn in leading Continental markets. Sales this year are down by about
25 per cent in France and Germany and by more than 40 per cent in Spain.
Car output for the first two months of the year totalled 219,986, up 5.03
per cent from the same period a year ago. Production for export was 12.27
per cent higher, at 99,498 from 88,622. January's production performance was
artificially boosted, however, because it contained five weeks' production
compared with four last year.
Commercial vehicle output in February fell to 17,912 compared with 21,255 a
year ago. Production for export was down 21.23 per cent from 12,956 to
10,207, reflecting the halt in production at Leyland Daf.
Commercial vehicle output for this year's first two months totalled 36,725,
down 2.47 per cent on last year's 37,655.
Production for export was 13.57 per cent lower, at 19,558 from 22,629.
In spite of the disappointment at February's figures, Sir Hal said:
'Compared with our EC partners, UK production still remains encouraging,
especially on the export front. However, current world trading patterns will
present our industry with a strong challenge over coming months.'
