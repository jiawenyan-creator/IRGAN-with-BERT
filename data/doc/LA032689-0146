THE WORLD 
U.S. and Vietnamese technical experts have discussed plans for further joint 
investigations to account for Americans listed as missing in action in the 
Vietnam War, the leader of the U.S. team said. Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, in a 
statement issued in Bangkok, Thailand, said the two sides met in Hanoi, the 
Vietnamese capital, for four days last week and that the talks were productive. 
Harvey is commander of the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center, the 
Honolulu-based military unit entrusted with resolving the fates of 2,371 
Americans who never returned from the war in Indochina.
