SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: BARONA 
A former official at the Barona Indian reservation pleaded guilty in federal 
court Monday to a felony charge stemming from the embezzling of about $10,000 
of trial funds. 
Susan Osuna, 43, the former tribal secretary and administrator for the Baron 
Band of Mission Indians, pleaded guilty to one count of embezzlement from an 
Indian tribal organization. 
Osuna, of Santa Ysabel, could be sentenced to a maximum of five years in 
federal prison and fined up to $250,000 when she is sentenced Nov. 13 by U. S. 
District Judge Howard B. Turrentine. 
The Office of Inspector General in the Department of the Interior investigated 
the case after tribal officials suspected that money had been embezzled, 
Assistant U. S. Atty. John R. Kraemer said. 
Osuna worked at the reservation near Lakeside from July, 1985, to July, 1988. 
The embezzled funds were not directly related to the bingo operation there, 
Kraemer said. 
Osuna has agreed to pay $10,000 restitution to the Barona Indians, Kraemer 
said.
