FT  11 JAN 94 / Mexican inflation rate slowed to 8 per cent last year
Mexico's inflation rate slowed to 8 per cent last year, the lowest annual
figure since 1972, writes Damian Fraser. This was nearly 3 percentage points
less than 1992's figure and came at the cost of stagnant economic growth,
which in the first nine months of the year was just 0.5 per cent.
The central bank reported that December's inflation rate was 0.8 per cent,
the second highest monthly rate last year. It was pushed up by an increase
in food prices (1.2 per cent) and education (1 per cent).
The high December figure ensured the annual rate was appreciably higher than
the government's revised forecast of 7.7 per cent. The government has
forecast an inflation rate of 5 per cent for this year.
Overall, inflation was kept in check by low increases in producer prices,
which rose a modest 5.9 per cent in the year.
Mexico's finance ministry has authorised creation of six more financial
intermediaries, as part of its strategy of opening up the financial sector
to more competition. The new institutions will lend money to small
businesses, provide mortgages, and in some cases pool credit for business
projects within a community.
