FT  09 DEC 92 / Male nurse wins sex prejudice case
A 50-year-old man who applied for a job in a children's nursery has won a
sex discrimination case over being turned down for the post of nursery
nurse.
Mr Charles Shiells, from Liverpool, applied through a Jobcentre for a
vacancy at the city's Tuebrook Tots Nursery but was told it had no toilet
facilities for men.
Mr Shiells, a qualified nursery nurse, took the nursery to an industrial
tribunal claiming sex discrimination and was awarded Pounds 600
compensation. He was backed by the Equal Opportunities Commission.
The nursery's management claimed that Mr Shiells was too old for the job and
that his sex was not relevant.
The last round in the legal battle over the level of compensation for people
who suffer sex discrimination at work finished yesterday in the European
Court of Justice with judgment expected in the new year.
The court will decide whether the Pounds 10,000 limit on compensation
awarded by industrial tribunals in sex discrimination cases is valid under
EC law and whether tribunals can order interest payments.
The test case was brought by Ms Helen Marshall who in 1986 won a landmark
sex discrimination case in the court after being forced to retire at 62.
