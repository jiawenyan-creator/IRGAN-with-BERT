SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Background



Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
must be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.

Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 

Federal Register

.

GK Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California (Registered Importer R90007) petitioned
NHTSA to determine whether 1990 Mercedes-Benz 300CE passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United
States. NHTSA published notice of the petition on January 27, 1994 (59 FR 3921) to afford an opportunity for public
comment. The reader is referred to that notice for a thorough description of the petition. No comments were received
in response to the notice. Based on its review of the information submitted by the petitioner, NHTSA has determined
to grant the petition.



Vehicle Eligibility Number for Subject Vehicles



The importer of a vehicle admissible under any final determination must indicate on the form HS7 accompanying
entry the appropriate vehicle eligibility number indicating that the vehicle is eligible for entry. VSP 64 is the
vehicle eligibility number assigned to vehicles admissible under this determination.



Final Determination



Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, NHTSA hereby determines that a 1990 Mercedes-Benz 300CE (Model ID 124.051)
not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards is substantially
similar to a 1990 Mercedes-Benz 300CE originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States
and certified under section 114 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, and is capable of being readily
modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
