Several possible rules violations in the University of Minnesota's men's 
athletic department, mostly involving former university administrator Luther 
Darville and the football program, are outlined in a report the school 
submitted to the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
Darville, former acting director of the Office of Minority and Special Student 
Affairs, allegedly disbursed $197,897 in cash and illegal benefits to football 
players in 1983-88. 
Darville, a native of the Bahamas, returned home during the investigation. 
Minnesota is trying to have him extradited.
