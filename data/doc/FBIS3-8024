<F P=106> [Interview with Marek Markiewicz, former chairman and </F>
current member of the National Radio and Television Broadcasting 
Council, by Beata Modrzejewska; place and date not given: 
"Something Else Is Bound To Happen"] 
  [Text] [Modrzejewska] How did you find out about your 
dismissal from the post of chairman of the National Radio and 
Television Broadcasting Council [KRRiT]? 
  [Markiewicz] An employee of the KRRiT's Office called me on 
the telephone saying that a letter in an open envelope has been 
brought into the secretariate; he read the letter to me and that 
is how I found out about the dismissal. 
  [Modrzejewska] Have you received signals from the Belvedere 
before, to the effect that it is the president's intention to 
dismiss you? [KRRiT member] Ryszard Bender paid a visit to 
[presidential aide] Minister Drzycimski that morning. 
  [Markiewicz] He did not tell us about his visit until the 
afternoon. 
  [Modrzejewska] Do you expect further moves by the president, 
such as for instance dismissal of other KRRiT members who were 
appointed by him? 
  [Markiewicz] That cannot be ruled out. There is a lot of 
determination on this issue. KRRiT is not demonstrating any 
signs of initiating a dispute or of putting the president's 
decisions in question, but on the other hand, the statement made 
by the president yesterday morning indicates that something else 
is bound to happen. 
  [Modrzejewska] During Tuesday's [1 March] press conference, 
you initiated an argument with the president in a decisive 
manner for the first time, by summarizing a telephone 
conversation during which the president had accused you of 
having accepted a bribe. 
  [Markiewicz] I have always been an enthusiast of the 
president. I have never wanted a fight with him and not a 
single aggressive phrase was ever spoken by me with regard to 
him. The accusation that was made, was terrible for me, but the 
contents of the conversation with the president would have 
remained my secret, if it had not been for the fact that the 
accusation also appeared in an open letter to the president by 
Jan Purzycki--that letter has not been denied. I could have 
assumed that there will be someone to say that I am stupid or 
incompetent, but to say that I am a thief? Regardless of what 
one can think of me as a person, the letter concerned an 
institution, that is KRRiT. Once someone starts accusing state 
institutions of something that has not been proven, then one can 
expect that other institutions will at least distance themselves 
from the accusation. I was very curious to see what the 
president's reaction will be. 
  [Modrzejewska] So in your view, what should have been the 
president's reaction after he received the letter? 
  [Markiewicz] He could have said that it does not look good 
in public when such things are being said publicly about a 
constitutional organ, regardless of what the organ really did or 
did not do, since such accusations weaken the position of these 
institutions, not the position of the individual persons; 
privately, I do not have to be concerned with such letters. 
  [Modrzejewska] Why do you not defend yourself by suing 
Purzycki in a court of law? 
  [Markiewicz] By myself, I am the smallest element--I mean 
nothing. The issue offended me very much and I do not rule out 
the possibility of seeking court action, but I want to say that 
dealing with courts is not one of my life passions. I know I 
had not taken any bribe. To try to contradict that, would mean 
caring not for oneself, but avoiding a spiral of publicity 
without any contradiction whatsoever, since that sets in motion 
a phenomenon in public life, which will kill us all. 
  [Modrzejewska] Do you see the president's moves as made with 
the future presidential elections in mind? 
  [Markiewicz] That is hard to assess. Everybody is aware of 
the upcoming elections and of the increasing destabilization and 
aggressiveness of Polish political life; I think it is not 
possible to ignore this, even if one is not aware of all that. 
  [Modrzejewska] Was the president's dissatisfaction with the 
granting of a license to PolSat caused by the fact that he had 
had his own favorite candidate? 
  [Markiewicz] Even if he did, I know nothing about it. But 
[PolSat owner] Solorz is not particularly in our good books for 
any specific reason; in making the decision we did, we tried to 
act in an objective manner. I pointed out during a radio 
conversation with [presidential aide] Professor Falandysz, that 
it is wrong to make the accusation that PolSat will have a 
monopoly since it received an all-national license; it would be 
close to impossible to grant PolSat half a concession or a 
quarter of it, whereas KRRiT had received a written motion 
concerning PolSat's withdrawal of its applications for local 
stations. 
  [Modrzejewska] Why did the president dismiss you exactly 
on the first anniversary of KRRiT's term of office? 
  [Markiewicz] Perhaps it had to do with some symbolic 
meaning, or perhaps with the granting of a license to PolSat? I 
do not want to go into the issue of human intentions; I always 
make the assumption that they are good, and that good intentions 
are the basis even of violent gestures. This is my approach to 
people, and in particular to Lech Walesa. 
  [Modrzejewska] So let us assume the president's intentions 
were indeed good. He says you committed a flagrant violation of 
the statute. Do you agree with the accusation? 
  [Markiewicz] I do not, but that is not an issue of 
intentions but one of the effects of how the statute, the limits 
of its functioning, and the basis for evaluating KRRiT's 
activity have been presented to the president. I have wanted 
many times to talk to the president concerning, among other 
things, what KKRiT is supposed to be doing based on the statute, 
and how it is supposed to function. I became aware of why such 
a conversation never took place when I found out that the 
president had thought that we were just supposed to perform some 
organizational work, and that we were to be replaced by others. 
I did not belong to a group of people who could present their 
views to the president--I acted like a clerk and that may be 
part of the assessment of the situation we are in. 
  [Modrzejewska] Accusations have been made that PolSat had 
not been adequately verified by KRRiT or that Zygmunt Solorz's 
credibility was not checked. 
  [Markiewicz] We have always expected other state organs to 
cooperate. We did everything in our power to verify PolSat's 
application. Other state organs failed to point out to us what 
they should have done, within their range of powers, to guard 
the country's interests. 
  [Modrzejewska] The Office of State Protection [UOP] says it 
pointed out some doubts but KRRiT did not request any further 
information. 
  [Markiewicz] UOP presented two documents to us but there are 
no reasons whatsoever for an institution which has the 
appropriate documents, to disclose them publicly. We are bound 
by rules of state secrecy. Once the duty is lifted from us, we 
will then reveal to the public all the documents we have. 
  [Modrzejewska] Was KRRiT not interested in press 
enunciations concerning PolSat and its owner? 
  [Markiewicz] Of course we were interested. We made personal 
guarantees, by signing the license over to PolSat. Every 
circumstance described by the press was examined. 
  [Modrzejewska] You stated publicly that Zygmunt Solorz had 
replied to every accusation. Do you mean he just answered, or 
did he present appropriate documentation? 
  [Markiewicz] He either answered, or presented documents--if 
the circumstances warranted that. After a few conversations 
with Solorz, I am increasingly convinced that the decision was 
right. Along with my colleagues from KRRiT, we imagined a 
scenario of someone else getting the license, and we simulated 
possible types of attack, and in our view, these attacks would 
have been rather similar with regard to anyone else who would 
receive the license. The press accused PolSat of having signed 
an agreement with Murdoch, but the press never published 
anything when the accusation turned out to be untrue; it was the 
same case with the accusation that Solorz has German citizenship. 
  [Modrzejewska] That was in the files. 
  [Markiewicz] Yes, it was, but one will have to prove that 
Solorz used to be a German citizen. 
  [Modrzejewska] Did Solorz increase PolSat's capital as he 
had promised? 
  [Markiewicz] Sure he did. The license describes subsequent 
stages of setting the share capital in motion, and if he fails 
to implement that, then that will be a reason for taking the 
license away from him. 
  [Modrzejewska] Was KRRiT not bothered by the many passports 
of Zygmunt Solorz? 
  [Markiewicz] It has never been proven that he has used them 
simultaneously. Mr. Solorz himself explained to us the issue of 
the passports, and these explanations are included in our files. 
In any event, that theme has never been brought up by state 
agencies. 
  [Modrzejewska] Is there any truth to rumors that you intend 
to run in the presidential elections? 
  [Markiewicz] When I heard this, I began wondering who could 
be wanting to hurt me by saying such things under the current 
situation. 
  [Modrzejewska] So do you intend to run, or not? 
  [Markiewicz] That scenario was not included in my thinking 
about the future. The work at the KRRiT defines the range of my 
aspirations or expectations. 
  [Modrzejewska] Is it possible that you will give up your 
membership in KRRiT? 
  [Markiewicz] In the spring, KRRiT will submit its report to 
the parliament, concerning its year-long activity. I have never 
made it a secret that it is my intention to make efforts for the 
KRRiT to present its report.
