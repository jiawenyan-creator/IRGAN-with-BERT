  [Text] Military authorities went on an emergency alert 
posture for about three hours on 30 April because of suspicious 
moves by North Korea in which some 20 North Korean fighter 
planes simultaneously moved southward from Pyongyang at around 
1415 [0515 GMT] today. Today's emergency alert posture against 
the North was ordered because North Korean fighter planes moved 
southward to Wonsan, Chinnampo, and Chukson from which these 
fighter planes can reach the skies of Seoul in five minutes. 
The ROK-U.S. Air Force operations command immediately declared 
the porcupine operation and went on alert. 
  The Defense Ministry said that it seems that this is a 
regular exercise by the North Korean Air Force, but since it is 
very rare to hold such an exercise on a Saturday, such an 
emergency alert posture was ordered.
