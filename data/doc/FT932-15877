FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Hunting jumps to Pounds 29m and calls for
Pounds 37m
HUNTING, the aviation, defence and oil services company, yesterday launched
a Pounds 36.8m rights issue to reduce debt and provide working capital for
its newly won contract to manage the government's Atomic Weapons
Establishment.
Shareholders are being offered two new shares for nine held at 185p, a 17.2
per cent discount to the theoretical ex-rights price prevailing on Tuesday
night.
Hunting's share price closed down 8p yesterday at 230p.
The Hunting family, which currently controls just under 40 per cent of the
shares, will not be taking up its rights - which are being placed at 19p
nil-paid.
In addition, the family also yesterday sold 1.55m shares to reduce debts of
the family controlled investment company. As a result the family's interest
will fall to just below 30 per cent of the enlarged capital, ending
effective Hunting control and increasing the previously restricted liquidity
in the shares.
Hunting announced the rights issue on the back of pre-tax profits for 1992
ahead from Pounds 15.4m to Pounds 29.2m on an FRS 3 basis. Sales rose 8 per
cent to Pounds 809.8m.
Operating profits were Pounds 34.6m (Pounds 32.5m) after a Pounds 1.1m loss
on the businesses sold to Williams Holdings in February. Hunting will,
however, book a Pounds 6m exceptional profit this year on this sale.
Gearing at the year end was 78 per cent. However, without the rights issue,
Aldermaston would have pushed gearing above 100 per cent. Gearing will still
be about 50 per cent after the rights issue.
At the operational level, aviation profits dipped to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds
11.1m), partly because of problems with avionics. Defence fell to Pounds
9.3m (Pounds 10.5m) but Hunting believes that even without the AWE contract,
this division's decline has been arrested. Profits in the oil division
increased to Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 11.3m) as Canada continued to perform
well.
Earnings came through at 17.5p (6.8p) per share diluted, and a final
dividend of 6p is proposed for an unchanged 10p total.
COMMENT
With yesterday's rights issue, Hunting has strengthened its weakest flank -
the balance sheet - and done it to support growth, not rationalisation.
Coming on top of the sale of its consumer products side to Williams, the
Aldermaston contract, and signs of real growth in the oil division, Hunting
appears to have put together a varied collection of businesses that could
prove significantly more interesting than its current rating would suggest.
On normalised pre-tax profits of Pounds 34m this year, and earnings of
17.8p, the rating is a modest 13 times. However, the Aldermaston contract is
of such a significant size, with sales probably about Pounds 250m, that
investors may want to wait to see that it fulfils the promise that has so
excited Hunting's board.
