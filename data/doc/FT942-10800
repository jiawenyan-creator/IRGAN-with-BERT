It was argued in a recent discussion of Schindler's List that the time had
come to stop harping on the appalling crimes of the Nazis. It was unjust, it
was suggested, for a new generation of Germans to be weighed down by the

be resisted.
Horizon comes up with Auschwitz: The Blue Prints of Genocide (BBC2, 8pm),
showing how architectural plans and documents relating to the death camp

the dramatisation of Ben Elton's comedy/satire about a plot to ruin the
earth. Elton stars as the modern Candide figure, CD (10.15pm).
Following yesterday's opening of its Watergate series, BBC2 sets out to
answer the question Whatever Happened to Woodward and Bernstein?, the two
reporters who broke the story (11.15pm).
