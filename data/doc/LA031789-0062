FIRST IMPRESSIONS: FOOD, FOOD, FOOD AT CABO CABO CABO 
The waitress removed the plate. The fact that it was still full did not seem to 
distress her. "Ooh," she said as she bore it away, "is that pasta?" I told her 
it was calamari. She nodded. "I looked down at it when I picked it up from the 
kitchen," she said, "and there were these little feet -- you know, the 
tentacles -- waving in the air. And I thought, like, how can people eat that 
stuff?" 
Most people at the wonderfully colorful Cabo Cabo Cabo in the Century City 
Marketplace, (213) 552-2226, probably won't be eating that stuff. They'll be 
pigging out on the all-you-can-eat fajitas ($7.95), indulging in huge 
hamburgers ($5.95 with a big heap of curlicue French fries), or eating the 
grilled fish, the gigantic salads or the pizzas cooked in the wood-burning 
oven. And they'll be drinking; there are 50 beers, 40 tequilas, and just about 
every other sort of alcoholic beverage you've ever encountered. 
This is, as you can see, a restaurant that leaves no taste unmet. And no 
wonder. The owners are Marlene Morris (of Panama Red's), Bob Morris (of R.J.'s, 
Gladstone's, etc.) and Bryant Morris (of Raging Waters Park). They've put 
together a virtual theme park of a place here, and if you aren't having fun, 
it's not because they're not trying.RUTH REICHL
