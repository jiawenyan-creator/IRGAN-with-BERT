  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, arrived in Ta'izz last 
night in response to the call and initiative of their eminences 
the ulema to meet with his brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice 
chairman of the Presidential Council, at the al-Janad Mosque 
today, Sunday, 27 Rajab 1414 Hegira, the anniversary of Prophet 
Muhammad's ascension to heaven. 
  In a statement to the Yemeni news agency, SABA', the brother 
chairman said that he hopes his meeting with his brother 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, which coincides with a religious occasion honored 
by the masses of our people and Islamic nation, namely, the 
anniversary of the Prophet Muhammad's ascension to heaven, will 
be an opportunity to find effective solutions to the current 
political crisis. He noted that our people have suffered, and 
continue to suffer, greatly as a result of this crisis which has 
had negative repercussions on the overall situation in the 
country and on citizens' living conditions in particular. He 
expressed the wish that this will be the last crisis in the 
history of the homeland. 
  He expressed great appreciation for the nationalist 
initiative of their eminences the ulema, an initiative that 
reflects their eagerness to perform their religious and national 
duty and to exert good offices to enable our homeland to 
overcome the difficult situation caused by the political crisis 
and the challenges that it has posed to the march of unity and 
democracy. 
  The brother chairman also praised the results of the 
meetings 
of the committee for dialogue among political forces as part of 
the efforts to overcome the crisis and firmly establish the 
pillars of the modern Yemeni state, the state of order, law, and 
constitutional institutions. 
  The brother chairman is accompanied by a number of 
officials. 
  Meanwhile, senior Yemeni ulema from various Yemeni 
governorates began to arrive at the Ma'adh Bin-Jabal Mosque in 
the al-Janad area in the Ta'izz Governorate to attend the grand 
gathering of the Yemeni ulema scheduled to begin today, Sunday, 
as part of the ulema's continued efforts to tackle the current 
political crisis. At the end of their meeting in Sanaa late last 
month, the ulema called for a meeting between brothers 
Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council 
chairman, and 'Ali Salim al- Bid, Presidential Council vice 
chairman, as a beginning to resolve the crisis and strengthen
