FT  04 NOV 92 / Reserves at Bank fall Pounds 2bn in month
THE BANK of England's underlying official reserves fell by Pounds 2bn
(Dollars 3bn) last month, slightly more than expected. But the fall gives
few clues to the extent of the Bank's intervention to prop up sterling in
September.
The drop followed September's record fall of Pounds 4.4bn, but together the
two figures amount to only a part of the Pounds 15bn-Pounds 20bn currency
reserves allegedly spent by the Bank shortly before the pound's devaluation
on September 16.
The Treasury figures show that Britain's overall gold and currency reserves
were Dollars 42.1bn at the end of October, compared with Dollars 42.7bn at
the end of September.
The final net drop of Dollars 539m was smaller than the underlying fall
because the Bank drew upon Dollars 3bn of special borrowing of up to Ecu10bn
in foreign currencies arranged at the beginning of September to boost the
pound.
Overall reserves were also bolstered by Dollars 846m of Ecu Treasury bill
proceeds.
The full amount that the Bank spent in mid September trying to shore up
sterling in Europe's exchange rate mechanism may not be known for months.
While in the ERM it was possible for the Bank to shroud the level of
intervention over any month by borrowing from other European central banks.
Those borrowings did not have to be repaid for up to nine months.
The Bank can also borrow on the foreign exchange forward market. Such loans
can be rolled over indefinitely.
Mr David Simmonds, currency economist at Greenwell Montagu, said: 'It is
impossible to know firstly how much of the UK's reserves were used during
September, and secondly the repayment schedule for borrowings and the
maturity ladder of forward contracts.'
