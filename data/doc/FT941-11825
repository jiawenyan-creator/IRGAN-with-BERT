FT  02 FEB 94 / Fiat offers new cars as prizes to bondholders
Fiat, Italy's struggling cars group, which prides itself on being a
trend-setter, has unveiled another financial gimmick.
The group, which this week forecast a L1,800bn (Pounds 705m) net loss for
1993, is issuing a L1,000bn bond to bolster its flagging finances.
The issue follows a L3,300bn cash call last September, which helped keep net
indebtedness down to L5,500bn last December - still well up on the L4,466bn
reported at the end of 1992.
The bond is linked to a 'prize draw'. One hundred lucky bondholders will win
its new sports coupe, while a similar number will be awarded the high
performance version of the new Punto small car.
Offering the prizes, selected on the basis of the serial numbers of the
individual L1m certificates which comprise the issue, is a marketing coup.
It may even overcome doubts about the group's bullish prediction of a return
to break even this year.
Fiat says the draw harks back to a tradition of offering cars as prizes to
bondholders.
The last time that was done was in 1956, when Fiat gave away the curvacious
but tiny 600 saloon. Some competitors have done the same. The IRI state
holding company, which then owned Alfa Romeo, now part of Fiat, offered 50
new 'Giulia TIs' in a mid-60s bond. About a decade earlier, the state-owned
Agip petrol company also gave away 50 Alfas.
