FT  01 MAY 93 / International Company News: Vereinsbank ahead 4.4% in first
period
BAYERISCHE Vereinsbank yesterday reported that group partial operating
profits - which exclude own-account trading gains - rose 4.4 per cent in the
first three months of the current year to DM386m (Dollars 239.7m), an
increase of DM16m over the comparable period for last year.
Total group profit, including trading gains, increased at a higher rate, the
Bavaria-based bank said, without giving any figure.
Mr Albrecht Schmidt, chief executive, told the annual meeting that
performance in the first quarter was 'satisfactory'. He said that, as
expected, the pace of business growth had slowed during the course of the
current year.
The group balance sheet grew by 3.5 per cent to DM260.5bn. At the parent
company, the balance sheet grew by 2.3 per cent and partial operating
profits climbed by 6.6 per cent to DM255m.
The figures show a slowdown from the record rate of growth enjoyed last
year, when group partial operating profits rose by 24.1 per cent to
DM1.48bn, but suggest that the banking sector is continuing to enjoy a
degree of immunity from the downturn affecting the German economy.
The figures do not include provisions for bad or doubtful debts, which are
struck only after operating profits.
