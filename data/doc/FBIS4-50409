  [Text] Wen Yuzhu, member of the Standing Committee of the 
Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee and commander of the 
Guangdong Provincial Military District, put forward the general 
demand on the building of the militia emergency detachments of 
the whole province for some time to come at the provincial 
on-the-spot meeting on the building of the militia emergency 
detachments, which ended in Huizhou yesterday. He said it is 
necessary to build the militia emergency detachments of our 
province into a politically reliable, well-equipped, and 
well-trained contingent with sound organization, with the 
required number of militiamen, and with good supply. In case of 
emergency, the detachments really should be able to assemble at 
the first call, to be ready for combat, to take orders, to play 
their role, and to make contributions to state security, social 
stability, and economic development. 
  The meeting disclosed that at present, the militia emergency 
detachments of our province have a total of 116 companies and 
535 independent emergency platoons. Their organization is sound 
and their education, training, and management are quite strict 
and regular. 
  At the meeting, the provincial military district commended 
33 
advanced companies and platoons and 52 advanced militiamen.
