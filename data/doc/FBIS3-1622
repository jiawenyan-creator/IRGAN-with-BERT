  [Text] Beijing, February 25 (XINHUA) -- China plans to 
borrow 1.076 billion U.S. dollars of foreign loans to build a 
huge water conservancy project designed to generate power and 
control flood of the Yellow River [Huang He]. 
  Work on the Xiaolangdi project, a site on the Yellow River 
40 
km north of Luoyang City in Henan Province, will start later 
this year, according to a Water Conservancy Ministry official. 
  Vice-Minister of Water Conservancy Zhang Chunyuan said that 
about 1.2 billion yuan has been spent on the preparation of the 
project in the past two years, involving 10,000 construction 
workers. 
  The foreign loans will be part of the total expenditure. 
However, Water Conservancy Ministry officials declined to give 
the total budget for the huge project. 
  Deng Shengming, deputy chief engineer of the Yellow River 
Conservancy Commission, said today that the project, which has a 
designed total capacity of 12.56 billion c.m. [cubic meters], 
will be able to control the largest flood to occur in 1,000 
years. Nearly 100 million people will be freed from all 
devastating flood threats caused by the river. 
  At present, the river dyke can only resist a flood of a size 
forecast to occur once every 60 years. 
  The project, to be completed in nine years, will help 
control 
the ice jams which occur every year downstream during the ice 
break-up and reduce the severe aggradation of the river bed 
along the lower reaches, the engineer said. 
  In addition, it will provide water for industry, as well as 
irrigation and produce hydro-electric energy along the lower 
reaches.
