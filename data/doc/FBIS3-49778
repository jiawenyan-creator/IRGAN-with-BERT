<F P=106> [Report by C. M.: "Another Depos in the Play?"] </F>
  [Text] As BORBA has unofficially learned from sources 
close to the leadership of the Serbian Renewal Movement, some of 
the membership would like to try to "enliven" the work of Depos 
[Democratic Movement of Serbia], but a Depos essentially 
different from the one that exists at present. In addition to 
the Serbian Renewal Movement and the unaffiliated members from 
the original Depos, the new Depos would also have place for the 
Democratic Party (the section that supports Zoran Djindjic), the 
Democratic Party of Serbia, and the Peasant Party of Milomir 
Babic.
