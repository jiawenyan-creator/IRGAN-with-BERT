 

Section 941.608. This section would address MROP project development and would provide for compliance with the procedures
and requirements of subpart E, except as modified by 941.608. 

In the regulatory text that follows the preamble section ``Other Matters,'' the reader should note that the terms
``Act'' and ``ACC'' are not defined in subpart F, because these terms are defined in subpart A of part 941. The ``Act''
refers, as previously noted, to the United States Housing Act of 1937, and ``ACC'' refers to Annual Contributions
Contract. 



Other Matters 



Environmental Impact 



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding
is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk
at the above address. 



Impact on Small Entities 



The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this proposed rule
before publication, and, by approving it, certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule's major effect is on public housing agencies (PHAs) which
are state and local governmental entities. The proposed rule adds a new subpart for the major reconstruction of obsolete
public housing projects, as required by the Act, and incorporates provisions requested by industry groups; as such,
it is anticipated that it will be considered beneficial to PHAs. 



Federalism Impact 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order No. 12612, 

Federalism,

 has determined that this proposed rule would not have a substantial, direct effect on the States or their political
subdivisions or on the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power
or responsibilities among the various levels of government. No significant change in the relationships or responsibilities
of the various levels of government will result from this proposed rule. 



Impact on the Family 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 

The Family,

 has determined that this proposed rule would not have a potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance,
and general well-being and thus is not subject to review under the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies
or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.




Regulatory Agenda 



This proposed rule was listed as sequence number 1684 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published
on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20469) under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 



Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs 



The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program title and number is 14.850, Public and Indian Housing. 



List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 941 



Grant programs_housing and community development, Loan programs_housing and community development, Public housing.

 


Accordingly, 24 CFR part 941 would be amended as follows:
