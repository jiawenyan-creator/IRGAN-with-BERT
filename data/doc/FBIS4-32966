  [Text] On the night of 30 May, rumors of military 
intervention exacerbated fear and worry among Haitian families; 
rumors that the U.S. military was controlling Mais Gate Airport. 
The rumors appear to have stemmed from a U.S. officer's 
statement on the military invasion of Haiti that was 
misunderstood. 
  A reliable source told Signal FM that a U.S. Army colonel 
said U.S. authorities have decided to invade Haiti and that all 
that remains now is to determine the main targets. This Army 
colonel also said Mais Gate Airport will be one of the main 
targets.
