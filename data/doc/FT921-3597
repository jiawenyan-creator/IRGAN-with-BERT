FT  13 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo and Hong Kong
continue to diverge
SHARE prices edged down on continued selling by corporate investors and
investment trusts, and closed a volatile day's trading at another new low
since October 1990, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 30.26 to 20,561.88 after a low of 20,331.60 in the
morning and a high of 20,713.90 in the afternoon. The index fluctuated late
in the day on index-linked trading, related to the exercise of options
contracts and arbitrage ahead of today's settlement of March futures
contracts.
Volume increased to 280m shares from 250m. Declines led advances by 557 to
401, with 161 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
slipped 6.27 to 1,427.21, as a total of 258 issues set new lows since the
start of last year, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index picked up 6.30 to
1,123.48.
Traders said today's special quotation, or settlement for futures and
options contracts, was creating less concern than usual among market
participants due to the smaller arbitrage cash positions against the March
futures.
However, some dealers noted the possibility of large arbitrage unwinding,
since the price difference between the futures and cash indices has been
narrower than on previous occasions, providing less incentive for
arbitrageurs to roll over positions.
Companies and investment trusts were seen liquidating holdings of
large-capital stocks and high-technology issues in the morning. However,
bargain hunting by foreign investors lifted blue chips, which have been
heavily sold during the past week. Nippon Steel improved Y5 to Y310 and
Hitachi also Y5 to Y761.
Short-term traders targeted drug and Aids-related issues. Okamoto, the most
active issue of the day, advanced Y70 to Y1,370 and Nippon Zeon climbed Y25
to Y705.
Nippon Mining forged ahead Y43 to Y500. The stock had been suspended by the
stock exchange ahead of the announcement of its merger with Kyodo Oil.
On the negative side, brokers continued to lose ground on concern over a
growing scandal involving securities houses trying to window-dress client's
accounts, by selling loss-making investments to other clients.
Daiwa Securities, which will incur losses of up to Y73.5bn due to irregular
trading practices, fell Y29 to Y746. Investors were alarmed by the size of
Daiwa's loss, and were concerned about further revelations within the
industry. Nomura Securities lost Y30 to Y1,130 and Nikko Securities fell Y40
to Y602.
Other financials were also weak, with Tokio Marine and Fire down Y34 to Y986
and Yasuda Fire and Marine losing Y35 to Y653. Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone fell Y2,000 to a new all-time low of Y664,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average eased 3.53 to 22,051.07 in volume of 157.6m
shares.
Roundup
HONG KONG continued to stand out strongly in a mixed Pacific Rim yesterday.
Early profit-taking was overwhelmed by follow-through buying in HONG KONG,
which extended its rally in heavy trading. The Hang Seng index added 36.85
at 5,042.81, its second consecutive record high, in turnover of HKDollars
2.87bn, after HKDollars 3.21bn.

rights issue was greeted with little enthusiasm.
The Straits Times Industrial index rose 13.34 to 1,461.01.

to 1,456.80 in thin turnover of NZDollars 13.2m. Telecom Corp was steady at
NZDollars 2.36 and Carter Holt Harvey dipped 2 cents to NZDollars 2.24, but
Brierley Investments went against the trend with a 1-cent gain to 99 cents.
SEOUL ended slightly up in choppy trading. Sunkyong rose on rumours that the
company was the most likely winner in the bids to be the second mobile
telecommunications maker. The composite index firmed 0.6 to 619.11 in
turnover of Won192.98bn (Won217.9bn).
