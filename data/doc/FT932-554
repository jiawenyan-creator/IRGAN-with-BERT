FT  28 JUN 93 / International Company News: Japan may reconsider derivatives
regulations
JAPANESE financial authorities may reconsider controversial regulations
limiting trading in derivatives which have angered foreign stockbrokers in
Tokyo specialising in the instruments.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to call on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to
follow principles agreed with the US in talks on Friday when the exchange
revises regulations governing stock index futures trading.
The ministry has softened its position after sustained foreign criticism
that it was re-regulating the stock market.
US officials regard the agreement as a small but significant further step in
unwinding Japanese financial regulations, after Tokyo offered concessions on
its tightly regulated pensions market last week.
The Japanese authorities said they would abolish the distinction between old
and new pension funds, which has disadvantaged foreign fund managers.
Foreign fund managers are only allowed to manage new money, collected after
the pension insurance law was revised in 1990 to allow foreign fund managers
into the market. This prevents foreign investment advisers from bidding for
the bulk of existing pension funds.
The ministry will also lower the minimum amount of assets which a fund
manager can receive to Y100m (Dollars 940,000), from Y500m for foreign
companies and Y1bn for Japanese companies, which may make it easier for
foreign companies to enter the market.
Last August, the ministry told the Tokyo Stock Exchange to consider
regulations on futures trading, which it said had helped to destabilise the
Tokyo stock market. However, on Friday the ministry agreed regulations
should be non-discriminatory and predictable.
Mr Lawrence Summers, the US Treasury under-secretary for international
affairs, said before the talks on Friday that regulations should be
introduced only for prudential reasons rather than to try to stabilise the
price of the stock market.
