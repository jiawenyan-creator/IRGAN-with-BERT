LOYOLA HOPES TO RECLAIM WCAC LEAD 
Loyola Marymount possibly can move back into a tie for the West Coast Athletic 
Conference lead with basketball games tonight at the University of San Diego 
and Saturday at St. Mary's. 
The Lions, 13-8 overall, are 6-2 in the WCAC, tied with St. Mary's in second 
place a game behind Pepperdine, which plays at St. Mary's tonight. 
San Diego, 6-14 and 1-7, will probably try to slow the tempo. The Lions are 
averaging 114.3 points, No. 1 in the nation, and its top scoring trio of Hank 
Gathers, Jeff Fryer and Enoch Simmons is accounting for nearly 78 points a 
game. San Diego is led by freshman Gylan Dottin's 12.9-point average. ALAN
