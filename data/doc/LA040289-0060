BUSH SHEDS SOME BAGGAGE 
President Bush is gradually shedding some ideological baggage that would have 
weighed him down in any attempt to help American schools improve. President 
Reagan wanted to give parents vouchers to help pay for public, private or 
parochial school educations, and President Bush pledged during his campaign to 
give such tax credits. Now he wisely says the government can't afford them. 
The government can't afford them financially, or philosophically. Financially, 
because the federal budget is already tight and should not be subsidizing 
private school education. And philosophically, because public education is the 
cornerstone of opportunity in this land. It must have the fullest federal 
support. Giving tuition tax credits would have hedged that support. 
Bush revealed his change of heart last week while talking to high school 
students visiting the White House. He said he had been intrigued with the idea 
of tuition tax credits but decided that federal budget problems make it 
unworkable. So in addition to a tour, these students learned that even 
Presidents can admit when they've had a bad idea. 
There is still a federal role in education, of course. It's partly financial: 
The government should increase the funds available for the successful Head 
Start preschool programs, for other education aid in impoverished neighborhoods 
and for innovative pilot programs. And it's partly philosophical: The President 
of the United States should be the nation's biggest booster of public 
education. Bush has lightened his load and can move more freely toward that 
goal now.
