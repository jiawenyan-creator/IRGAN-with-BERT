  [Text] Baghdad, 16 May (INA) -- Baghdad Mayor Tahir 
Muhammad Hassun has stated that the assistance offered by 
specialised health, environment, and human rights organizations 
and agencies has not improved the environment situation in 
Baghdad and has not remedied the increasing shortage suffered by 
the Baghdad municipality services. 
  At a news conference attended by local, Arab, and foreign 
correspondents as well as the INA correspondent, the Baghdad 
mayor said that these organizations have provided the Baghdad 
municipality departments with only 5 percent of what they direly 
needed in the various services sectors. 
  The Baghdad mayor reviewed the direct impact the continued 
imposition of the unjust embargo has had on Iraq and on Baghdad 
in particular, especially the suspension of work in many Baghdad 
city development projects, the piling of garbage in various 
quarters of the city in view of the shortages experienced by the 
municipality in the human and mechanical field since the 
specialized machinery has come down from 800 to 300, with most 
of these out of order. 
  He explained that 500 to 700 tonnes of garbage are daily 
left 
on the streets. This means more than 20,000 tonnes a month. He 
said that the shortage experienced by the various municipality 
services is increasing and that the continued piling of garbage 
on the streets will lead to the spread of many infectious 
diseases 
  Tahir Muhammad Hassun warned against the impending danger 
that threatens the individual and the environment in Baghdad as 
a result of the spread of diseases stemming from pollution, and 
the overflowing of the sewerage system and how this will cause 
the death of thousands of citizens. 
  The news conference was attended by the deputy mayor and the 
municipality dpartments' directors.
