FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: CHH to float unit and cut
dividend
CARTER Holt Harvey (CHH), New Zealand's largest forestry group, is to float
its sea food processing subsidiary Sealord, cut its dividend from next year
and raise NZDollars 400m (USDollars 222.2m) through a one-for-seven rights
issue in what it says is the final phase of its recapitalisation programme.
This package of measures, which will raise around NZDollars 1bn, is instead
of the previously announced plan to sell its Chilean forestry assets owned
by its Copec subsidiary. Mr Richard Carter, chief executive, said the
directors believed it was in the company's best long-term interests to
retain that investment.
Mr Carter, who is to retire shortly following the appearance of
International Paper of the US, as a big shareholder in CHH and is to take
over managing the company, had previously said Sealord would not be sold.
He said the earlier decision to sell Copec had been made for financial
reasons. The directors now believed the alternative refinancing package
would allow the group to retain this strategic investment.
Sealord, which took over Fletcher Fishing in 1990, is the country's largest
deep sea fishing company and also has a large share of the inshore fishery.
Mr Carter said the flotation would demonstrate Sealord's earnings
capability.
The two controlling shareholders in CHH, Brierley Investments and
International Paper, have underwritten the cash issue and will take up their
entitlements. In November the two companies formed a joint venture to
control 32 per cent of CHH.
Mr Carter said a decision to cut dividends for the 1992-93 year was in
recognition of the company's increased capital and international financial
climates.
He said the company was still expecting to make a profit of NZDollars 175m
for the year to March 1992.
