CHAMINADE RUNS OVER SANTA MARIA, 42-23 
Santa Maria High football Coach Barney Eames joked that traveling to Chaminade 
for a game was like playing at Notre Dame with the Pope in attendance. 
Well, he might have run into something more powerful in Chaminade's running 
tandem of Colin Havert and Felix Goodson. Havert rushed for 185 yards in 22 
carries and scored three touchdowns, and Goodson accounted for 195 all-purpose 
yards and three touchdowns as Chaminade rolled to a 42-23 win. 
Chaminade's Dan Kelly intercepted Joe Robledo's pass on the game's first play 
and, five plays later, Goodson scored from eight yards. Aaron Weiss picked off 
another pass on Santa Maria's next drive, and Chaminade quarterback Joe Meyer 
hit Goodson with a 71-yard touchdown pass that gave Chaminade a 13-0 lead. 
Havert scrambled 65 yards for another score that gave Chaminade a 20-0 
first-quarter lead. 
"We played great in the first quarter," Chaminade Coach Rich Lawson said. "Then 
we only played well about 10 seconds of the second quarter." 
That was about how long it took Havert to score on runs of nine and one yard to 
put Chaminade (4-1) ahead, 35-0. 
Murray Dillon, who rushed for 190 yards in 18 carries, ran 89 yards for a score 
and Santa Maria (2-3) added a two-point conversion pass from kicker Pedro 
Moreida to Abdul Lewis in the second half. Then Shane Montgomery caught a 
seven-yard pass from Robledo and Moreida's point-after kick pulled Santa Maria 
within 35-23 with 8:26 left. 
But there was plenty more of Goodson -- who had 88 yards receiving and 73 
rushing. A 6-foot-1, 175-pound senior, Goodson answered with an 11-yard run. 
Mike Terzian's point-after concluded the scoring with 3:41 left.
