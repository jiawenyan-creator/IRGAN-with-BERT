DR. NEIL SOLOMON; 
SMOKE AND ASTHMA 
Question: My brother-in-law smokes even though his children (my niece and 
nephew) have asthma. 
He says that once a child has asthma, it doesn't make any difference if anyone 
in the house smokes. I told him he's a jerk, and I'd like your opinion. 
Answer: I don't know whether your brother-in-law is a jerk, but I can tell you 
that passive cigarette smoke has an adverse effect on asthmatic symptoms. There 
are many reasons for people not to smoke. Having a child or children with 
asthma should be at the top of the list.
