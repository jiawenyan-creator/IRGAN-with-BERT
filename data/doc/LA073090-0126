NAMES IN THE NEWS; 
SWAYZE'S WIFE FOUND 'GHOST' 
Patrick Swayze says his wife spotted the script for "Ghost," his first hit 
movie since "Dirty Dancing" in 1987. 
"It made me cry," actress Lisa Niemi, Swayze's wife of 15 years, said in the 
Aug. 6 issue of People magazine. 
Swayze said he kept his wife in mind during steamy love scenes with co-star 
Demi Moore. 
"I used Lisa a lot, that core feeling about the person you love," he said. 
"It's there all the time. All you gotta do is call it up." 
Moore, wife of "Die Hard" star Bruce Willis, said of Swayze: "He's sensitive 
and has a vulnerability that's right out there. And he also looks great with 
his shirt off."
