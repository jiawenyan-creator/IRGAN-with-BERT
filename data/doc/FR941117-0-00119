 

(a) Channels in the Private Radio General Access Pool and the Private Radio Power Pool may be assigned only if the applicant
shows that none of the channels in the Public Mobile Pool are available for the proposed use.
(b) Channels in the Public, Private, Government Shared Pool are allocated for assignment in the Private Operational-Fixed
Microwave Service (47 CFR part 94) and to U.S. government fixed stations.


22.623 

System configuration.


This section requires a minimum configuration for point-to-multipoint systems using the channels listed in 22.621.
(a) 

928960 MHz. 

The channels may be assigned, individually or paired, only to fixed transmitters in a system that controls at least
four public mobile base transmitters that transmit on the same channel. If a 932933 MHz channel and a 941942
MHz channel are assigned as a pair, the 941942 MHz channel must be assigned only to control transmitters; the
932933 MHz channel may be assigned to control or fixed relay transmitters.
(b) 

470512 MHz. 

These channels may be assigned only individually (unpaired), to control transmitters that directly control at least
four public mobile base transmitters that transmit on the same channel. Fixed relay transmitters are not authorized.
(c) 

Selection and assignment. 

The FCC selects and assigns a channel when granting applications for authorization to operate a new station to transmit
in the 470512, 932933 and 941942 MHz frequency ranges. Applicants having a preference may request
the assignment of a specific channel or channel pair, but the FCC may in some cases be unable to satisfy such requests.


22.625 

Transmitter locations.


This section governs where point-to-multipoint transmitters on the channels listed in 22.621 may be located.
(a) 

928960 MHz. 

In this frequency range, the required minimum distance separation between co-channel fixed transmitters is 113
kilometers (70 miles). However, this requirement may be waived if the applicant submits an engineering analysis
that shows that no interference would be caused to either system. In such a case, a developmental authorization may
be issued (see 22.415). If no interference is experienced during the term of the developmental authorization,
the licensee may apply for a regular authorization.
(b) 

470512 MHz. 

The purpose of the rule in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is to define the areas in which the 470512 MHz channels
are allocated for public mobile use. The purpose of the rules in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section is to reduce
the likelihood that interference to television reception from public mobile operations on these channels will occur.
(1) 

Control transmitter locations. 

Control transmitter locations must be within 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the designated locations in this paragraph.
