FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: No split for Philip Morris
Shares in Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, yesterday shed
Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 50 5/8 as the company dampened stock market hopes
that it was poised to split its tobacco operations from the rest of the
business.
The company issued a terse statement saying: 'It is not anticipated that
this issue will be before the board in the foreseeable future.'
Like other US tobacco manufacturers, Philip Morris has been suffering
downward pressure on its share price because of increasingly intense
opposition to smoking in the US, bringing threats of anti-smoking
legislation and lawsuits seeking damages for smoking-related diseases.
Last month Philip Morris confirmed a Financial Times report that it was
considering splitting off its tobacco operations from the non-tobacco part
of its business as one of several possible options for enhancing the value
of its stock.
On Wednesday the company's shares were suspended all day as directors met to
discuss the possibility of a separation. The length of the meeting, an
unprecedented six-and-a-half hours, suggested that the issue was keenly
debated.
Afterwards, however, the company said the board had decided to take no
action. Instead it appointed Mr Geoffrey Bible, executive vice president for
world tobacco, to the board and promoted him to vice chairman for worldwide
tobacco.
Shareholders voted to defeat a proposal to spin off disparate businesses of
US Shoe, Reuter reports.
The group's directors had recommended shareholders to vote against the
proposal.
