FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Private health cover spreads -
Bethan Hutton finds that Bupa remains the biggest but Norwich is making its
mark
One in nine people in the UK is now covered by private medical insurance,
according to research by market analyst Euromonitor. It says the UK will
spend Pounds 1.4bn on medical premiums this year and predicts the figure
will have reached more than Pounds 1.5bn by 1998.
Spending on premiums rose by 46 per cent between 1989 and 1993, while the
amount spent on advertising surged during the same period: up by 126 per
cent to Pounds 12.9m in 1993. Much of this was spent as the British United
Provident Association (Bupa) battled to retain its dominant position and
Norwich Union launched a growing range of plans.
Bupa still has the largest share of the market, with 46 per cent, followed
by PPP with 28 per cent. Figures from specialist health analyst Laing &amp;
Buisson show that Bupa's market share has fallen from 59 per cent in 1985.
Newcomer Norwich Union, which started selling medical insurance only in
1991, has taken 8 per cent of the market already and overtaken the Western
Provident Association to become the third-largest provider of private
insurance.
L&amp;B's latest report shows that an estimated 6.58m people in the UK have
private cover, which is a slight fall from the peak of 6.63m in 1990. The
decline is thought to have been caused mainly by the recession and steep
premium increases. These have slowed, from 6.9 per cent above inflation in
1991 and 9.7 per cent in 1992 to 3.8 per cent in 1993. But L&amp;B says that,
despite the success insurers have had in controlling costs, premiums are
likely to continue to rise faster than inflation for the rest of the decade.
Euromonitor and L&amp;B both expect the market for private medical insurance to
start expanding again over the next few years as worries over the National
Health Service continue and new products make private cover more accessible.
L&amp;B projects from present trends that almost 17 per cent of the population -
or 9.9m people - could have private insurance by the year 2000, compared
with just over 11 per cent today.
Several new types of policy have appeared, particularly at the low-cost end
of the market. This started with PPP's introduction of the first 'six-week
wait' policy in 1979; this paid for private treatment only if the NHS
waiting list was longer than six weeks. Since then, helped by all the
publicity about long NHS waiting lists, six-week plans have spread
throughout the market. Other plans restrict cover to in-patient treatment or
certain types of hospital.
