  [Text] Beijing, March 19 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa said Saturday [19 March] he is not 
contemplating general elections under the old electoral system 
for the powerful House of Representatives. 
  In a meeting with Japanese reporters traveling with him on 
his China trip, Hosokawa said he is not thinking of calling 
general elections until a new electoral system formally replaces 
the old electoral system under which the 511 members have been 
elected. The new system calls for electing 300 members via 
single-seat constituencies and 200 via proportional 
representation. 
  Hosokawa also said he has no plans to release further data 
or 
summon witnesses before a parliamentary session in connection 
with a 100 million yen loan from the now defunct Tokyo Sagawa 
Kyubin.
