  [Text] In an interview with a Khorizont Radio Network 
representative, President Dr. Zhelyu Zhelev expressed sharp 
disagreement with reports published in the 7 January 1994 issues 
of certain Bulgarian dailies regarding the functions and 
prerogatives of the president's military cabinet. 
  Dr. Zhelev described such materials as insinuations and as 
biased reports written at the the instruction of certain 
political forces. The president's spokesman, Valentin Stoyanov, 
is expected to make a statement on the subject of the military 
cabinet and its functions on Bulgarian National Radio and 
National Television later in the day. 
  Dr. Zhelev also commented on the recent meeting between 
representatives of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] and the 
Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] at the SDS headquarters, 134 
Rakovski Street. The president described the meeting as the 
result of an acute internal crisis affecting both coalitions 
that evokes fear of democratic ideas. 
  Mr. Zhelev opposes the idea that parliament should appoint a 
caretaker government and that it should work during the period 
of preparation for the next elections.
