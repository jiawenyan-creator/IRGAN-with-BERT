FT  11 FEB 92 / Polish finance minister put to test
MR Karol Lutkowski, Poland's finance minister, will be under pressure today
from spending ministries in the new centre-right government led by Mr Jan
Olszewski.
Mr Lutkowski is an advocate of stringent monetary policies in a government
largely formed by critics of the International Monetary Fund-backed
stabilisation policies run by his predecessor, Mr Leszek Balcerowicz.
Last year's Paris Club agreement linked a reduction of over 50 per cent in
Poland's Dollars 33bn (Pounds 18bn) official debt to compliance with IMF
performance criteria.
Last week, Mr Michael Deppler, deputy IMF head in Europe, reminded the
government that it needed an agreement with the Fund if it is to restructure
its overall Dollars 46.5bn external debt - one third owed to western banks.
With this in mind, Mr Lutkowski said he wanted to contain the budget deficit
at around Zl 60,000bn (Pounds 2.92bn) or 4.5 per cent of GDP.
