  [Text] Bileca, Jan 2 (TANJUG) -- Commander of the Bosnian 
Serb Army's General Staff General Ratko Mladic has said that the 
end of war in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
is not yet in sight despite the Serb side's utmost efforts to 
have peace restored. 
  The Bosnian Serbs have to be ready to protect themselves and 
if forced, to continue the war till final victory, because "our 
enemies, backed by the German factor, the United States and 
Islamic countries, are committed to resuming the war," said 
General Mladic in his new year's and Christmas message. 
  In Bosnia-Herzegovina, the civil war between three 
communities -- Moslem, Serb and Croat -- has been going on for 
more than 20 months now. After the forcible secession of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina from the former Yugoslav Federation and the 
outbreak of the civil war, the Bosnian Serbs and Croats 
proclaimed their national states on their ethnic territories. 
  The Moslem side, however, continues to aspire to a unitary 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in which they would dominate as the most 
populous community. 
  General Mladic assessed that the Bosnian Serb Army, together 
with its people, achieved great results in protecting the Serb 
population and territories last year through their defensive and 
liberation war which had been forced on them. 
  The results achieved on a military plane, the message said, 
were the key presumption for our state and political leadership, 
to struggle internationally for the recognition of the Serb 
republic and for the exercise of their natural law to be masters 
of their own fate in their own home.
