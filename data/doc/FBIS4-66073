Embargo, Sanctions"] 
  [Text] On Tuesday evening [17 May], the UN Security Council 
decided to maintain the embargo imposed against Iraq in August 
1990 following its invasion of Kuwait. [Iraqi] Deputy Prime 
Minister Tariq 'Aziz had traveled to New York to try to convince 
the Council members to change their attitude toward Baghdad. 
The United States and Britain favored the maintenance of the 
sanctions, whereas France, the PRC, and Russia pleaded for a 
relaxation.
