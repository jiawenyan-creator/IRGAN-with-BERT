<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this interim rule, the Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations on Birth Control, Pregnancy, Child Placement,
and Abortion. This amendment removes references to restrictions on the Bureau of Prisons' funding of an elective
abortion. Removing these references is necessary to conform to changes in legislative authority. This amendment
also makes various editorial or organizational changes for the sake of clarity.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations in 28 CFR part 551, subpart C, on Birth Control, Pregnancy, Child
Placement, and Abortion. A final rule on this subject was published in the 

Federal Register

 June 29, 1979 (44 FR 38252) and was amended December 30, 1986 (51 FR 47179).



Each year since 1987, Congress has included restrictions in the Department of Justice appropriations legislation
on the funding of elective abortions. Section 551.23 had been revised to reflect the imposition of these restrictions.
The appropriations bill for FY 1994 did not include such restrictions, and the Bureau of Prisons is adjusting its regulations
accordingly.

Paragraph (a) of 551.23, which states that it is the responsibility of the inmate to decide whether to have an
abortion or to bear the child, is unchanged. The provisions formerly in paragraph (b) pertaining to the financing
of an abortion have been removed. The provisions formerly contained in paragraph (c) pertaining to counseling have
been retained in new paragraph (b). New paragraph (b) also contains requirements for written documentation previously
required by former paragraph (d). The provisions in former paragraph (e) have been restated in new paragraph (c).
New paragraph (c) has been further revised for the sake of clarity and to remove references to where an elective abortion
was to take place.

Additional editorial or organizational amendments to the provisions for pregnancy and child placement include
use of the word ``ensure'' in 551.22(b), and the consolidation of the provisions formerly in 551.24(b)
and (c), along with the consequent redesignation of 551.24(d).

Because this amendment, in response to Congressional action, essentially restores the regulations to the wording
which was originally promulgated, the Bureau finds good cause for exempting the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, and delay in effective date, and is implementing
this change as an interim rule. Members of the public may submit comments concerning this rule by writing to the previously
cited address. These comments will be considered before the rule is finalized.

The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866,
and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
