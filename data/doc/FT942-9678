FT  14 MAY 94 / Heseltine postpones de-regulation white paper
Trade secretary Michael Heseltine, pictured at the conference, last night
postponed the white paper on de-regulation from next Monday until after the
funeral of John Smith next Friday. The decision came in response to a plea
from Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade secretary. Mr Heseltine said the decision
meant breaking the convention that policy statements must not be issued
within three weeks of an election. The European parliament elections are on
June 9.
