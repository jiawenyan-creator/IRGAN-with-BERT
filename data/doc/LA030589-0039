David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader elected last month to the Louisiana 
House of Representatives, called the Rev. Jesse Jackson a "racist" and said 
affirmative action and minority set-aside programs should be abolished. "I 
think the racists in this city are people like Jesse Jackson," Duke said at a 
Chicago news conference after addressing the national convention of the 
right-wing Populist Party of America. Jackson declined comment on Duke's 
statements, except to say: "I don't think it's an American point of view."
