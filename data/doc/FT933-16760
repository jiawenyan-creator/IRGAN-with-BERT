FT  02 JUL 93 / OECD Economic Outlook: E Europe growth predicted
THIS YEAR will see a resumption of growth in certain central and east
European countries, according to OECD projections.
Modest economic expansion is forecast for Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic, but the situation is more precarious for Bulgaria and Romania
where basic structural reforms have not been completed.
Unemployment is expected to continue rising in all the region's countries
before beginning to fall in 1994.
The OECD points to three main barriers to more dynamic growth in the main
east European economies:
State enterprise sectors are burdened with many unprofitable companies with
deteriorating balance sheets. Social and political considerations, however,
make wholesale bankruptcy a difficult route. Recently restructured banking
systems require banks to undertake new lending with extreme prudence. They
are also under pressure to strengthen profitability through lower costs and
by maintaining large interest rate spreads. As a result access to bank
credit is expensive and restricted for all but the most preferred or best
borrowers. Narrow tax bases have emerged as a structural weakness as
productive activity shifts from the public sector to the private sector
which is more prone to tax avoidance. This has resulted in big budget
deficits in most countries, except the the Czech Republic.
