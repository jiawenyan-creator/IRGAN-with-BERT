 

The Monitoring Committee recommended a commercial quota of 9.67 million lb (4.38 million kg), a 40-percent reduction
from the 1994 quota. This recommendation was based on the low-recruitment estimate and represents a 70-percent probability
of achieving the target fishing mortality rate. The Monitoring Committee also recommended that the commercial size
limit be increased from 13 inches (33 cm) to 14 inches (35.6 cm), that the minimum mesh size be increased by 1/2 inch (1.27
cm), and that the commercial size limit be applied to scallop dredge gear. 
The Demersal Committee's recommendation, which the full Council adopted, took into account considerable testimony
received from the industry and public at Council meetings, describing the potential negative economic impacts of
this decrease in harvest limits. Industry representatives testified that a 40-percent reduction from the 1994 quota
level would be severely damaging to their businesses. Most industry commenters believed that the 1995 quota level,
mesh, and size limits should remain unchanged from 1994. In addition, the Demersal Committee and Council considered
data from the North Carolina trawl survey that indicates an above-average year class has been produced in 1994. While
other surveys have yet to confirm this, the North Carolina survey has tracked abundance very well in past years. 
After considering these factors, the Demersal Committee and Council recommended setting the quota and other restrictions
based upon the mean-level stock projection, rather than the low-level stock projection used as the basis for recommendations
made by the Monitoring Committee. This resulted in a recommended quota level that is 27 percent lower than that implemented
in 1994, and is comparable to the quota level implemented in 1993. The probability of achieving the target fishing
mortality rate by this quota level is 50 percent. Continuation of 1994 mesh and fish size limits was also recommended.

The Council made its recommendations to the Regional Director at its meeting of September 2829, 1994. The Regional
Director has reviewed the recommended specifications and has determined preliminarily that they are necessary
to assure that the fishing mortality rates specified in 625.20 are not exceeded. Comments are specifically
requested on: (1) A coastwide harvest limit of 19.4 million lb (8.8 million kg), (2) a coastwide commercial quota of
11.6 million lb (5.3 million kg), (3) a coastwide recreational harvest limit of 7.8 million lb (3.5 million kg), (4)
no change from the present minimum commercial fish size of 13 inches (33 cm), and (5) no change in the present minimum-mesh
restrictions of 51/2 inch (14.0 cm) diamond or 6 inch (15.2 cm) square. 
NMFS is concerned that the quota recommended by the Council may be too high. NMFS invites comments on the Council's
proposed quota and whether it will reasonably assure that the 1995 mortality goals can be achieved. 
If these specifications are adopted, the commercial quota allocated to each state according to the percentage shares
specified in 625.20(d)(1), would be the amounts depicted in Table 1 below. These state allocations do not reflect
the adjustments required under 625.20, if 1994 landings exceed the quota for any state. A notification of allocation
adjustment will be published in the 

Federal Register

, if such an adjustment is necessary. 
The Council recommended the specifications before the November 4, 1994, Opinion and Order of the District Court in


Fishermen's Dock Cooperative v. Brown,

 No. 2:94cv338 (E.D. Va.), which ordered the 1994 commercial quota increased from 16.0 million lb (7.26 million kg)
to 19.05 million lb (8.64 million kg). The Council's recommended specifications for 1995 do not account for the possible
increase in mortality that could occur as a result of this upward adjustment of the quota. Consequently, a re-examination
of the factors in 625.20 that must be considered in setting the annual quota will have to be undertaken to assess
what quota level in 1995 will assure attainment of the fishing mortality reduction goal of 0.53. If the adjusted quota
in 1994 is completely harvested, the current recommended quota for 1995 will have to be adjusted downward.
