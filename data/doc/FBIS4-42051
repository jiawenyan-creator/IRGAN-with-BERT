  [Text] Yerevan June 29 TASS -- A team of international 
experts arrived on Wednesday in Yerevan to examine the Armenian 
nuclear power plant. 
  The team consists of representatives of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who will examine the reactors, 
pipes, steam generators and other parts vital for the safety of 
the plant. 
  IAEA expert Eduard Saakov representing the research 
institute 
Rosenergoatom told ITAR-TASS that the team has a lot of work to 
do. He pointed out the high professional level of the plant's 
employees, which, he stressed, is crucial for its future 
operation. He also said that the IAEA experts have supported 
the plan of measures proposed by Armenian specialists to 
increase the safety of the plant. 
  He refrained from naming concrete dates when the plant can 
resume operation. Saakov stressed that this can occur only 
after the completion of work to increase its safety. 
  The head of the group, Bernard Gachot, noted that the IAEA 
does not provide financial support, but can facilitate the 
search for investors at the political level. 
  Armenian Prime Minister Vigen Chitechyan said the Armenian 
government expects to receive a report from the group in two 
weeks.
