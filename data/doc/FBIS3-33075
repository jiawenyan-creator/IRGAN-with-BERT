  [Text] Quito--The Andean Development Corporation (CAF) 
approved credit operations during 1993 for a total of $232 
million to carry out various development projects in Ecuador. 
  The executive president of CAF, Enrique Garcia Rodriguez, 
said that $55.6 million went to loans for investment projects 
and share purchasing, $174.9 million for short- and medium-term 
financing, and $1.5 million was allocated for technical 
assistance. He pointed out that the institution's credit support 
was concentrated primarily in two sectors: hydrocarbons and 
transport, specifically, the development of petroleum fields and 
the maintenance of the country's highway system. 
  Garcia Rodriguez said that this would result in an increase 
of foreign exchange earnings generated by the petroleum sector 
and, in addition, would facilitate the transportation of private 
sector products, internally as well as toward ports, increasing 
the competitiveness of domestic industry by reducing 
transportation costs.
