FT  06 OCT 92 / Romanian vote
Mr Ion Iliescu, Romania's incumbent president, will face his rival Mr Emil
Constantinescu in a two-way run-off next Sunday, according to results from
the first round of presidential elections on September 27, writes Virginia
Marsh in Bucharest. Mr Iliescu is firm favourite for re-election.
The central electoral bureau yesterday again failed to produce final results
for the concurrent parliamentary election due to a continuing investigation
into the high number of anulled ballots. More than 10 per cent of votes cast
were declared void last week, raising question marks over the fairness of
the election.
