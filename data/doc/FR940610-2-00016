SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On April 15, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are 
Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (59 FR 18104) of 
proposed additions to the Procurement List. 



After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
military resale commodities and service, fair market price, and 
impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors, 
the Committee has determined that the military resale commodities 
and service listed below are suitable for procurement by the 
Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 4648c and 41 CFR 512.4. 
I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the 
military resale commodities and service to the Government. 
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
current contractors for the military resale commodities and 
service. 
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the military resale commodities and service to the Government. 
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 4648c) in connection with the military resale 
commodities and service proposed for addition to the Procurement 
List. 
Accordingly, the following military resale commodities and 
service are hereby added to the Procurement List: 


Military Resale Commodities 


Pad, Replacement, Handle Scrubber 


M.R. 540 
M.R. 545 
M.R. 546 


Service 


Janitorial/Grounds Maintenance, 
Buffumville Lake and Hodges Village Dam, 
Oxford, Massachusetts 




This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the 
effective date of this addition or options exercised under those 
contracts.
