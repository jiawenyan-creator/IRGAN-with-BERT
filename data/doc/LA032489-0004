Iran's interior minister said that the execution order against British author 
Salman Rushdie will be carried out despite the efforts of what he described as 
"world colonial powers," Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said. Ali 
Akbar Mohtashemi met with the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who issued the order 
last month. "World colonial and arrogant powers should know the children of 
Islam will execute the divine ruling against deviated people, apostates and 
others trying to fight Islam," Mohtashemi said. The death order was issued 
against Rushdie for his novel "The Satanic Verses," which many Muslims see as 
blasphemous.
