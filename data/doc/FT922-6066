FT  27 MAY 92 / Lib Dems seek water statement
THE LIBERAL Democrats are to urge Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary,
to make a Commons statement on the drought when parliament returns next
week.
Mr Simon Hughes, the party's environment spokesman, said an average of 20
per cent of total water supply leaked away before reaching customers' taps.
His comments came after Mr Howard announced a review of water use.
