FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Intangibles boost Lonrho
LONRHO'S profits for the year to the end of September 1992 were
substantially boosted by a change in accounting policy on intangibles, a
document to shareholders shows.
According to a circular issued by Lonrho yesterday on its proposed rights
issue, its estimated net profit last year was Pounds 82m. Of this, Pounds
76m was made up of extraordinary profits, consisting of Pounds 150m from the
sale of assets less losses on disposals and closure costs.
Lonrho has retrospectively written off the intangible value of its newspaper
titles, consisting of the Herald and Evening Times in Glasgow and the
Observer. The Glasgow papers, sold during the year for Pounds 75m, had an
estimated intangible value of Pounds 50m. Without the accounting change, net
profits would thus have been reduced to about Pounds 32m, compared with a
dividend payment of Pounds 27m.
Net asset value per share at the end of the year was shown at 157p after the
write-off of intangibles. Lonrho states that a full take-up of the proposed
Pounds 164m rights issue, together with the Pounds 124m from the sale of the
VAG motor subsidiary to Volkswagen, would reduce net asset value to 146p.
