METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLDEN TOURS L.A. ZOO TO ASSESS CONDITIONS 
City Councilman Nate Holden toured the Los Angeles Zoo Monday, assessing for 
himself the conditions that prompted federal officials to threaten possible 
revocation of its license. 
Holden, who was escorted by zoo Director Warren Thomas, said that he saw a need 
for better all-around maintenance but added "from what I've seen today . . . 
they're obviously correcting the most serious problems." 
For more than three years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has repeatedly 
cited the zoo for violations ranging from inadequate food storage to pest and 
rodent problems. Department officials say the zoo's administrators have been 
slow in responding to their complaints, prompting them to issue a letter last 
week threatening the zoo with stiff fines or revocation of its license to 
operate if the violations are not corrected immediately. Holden said he will 
submit his findings to council President John Ferraro, who is calling for an 
investigation.
