FT  31 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Go-ahead for Mount Kare deal
THE GOVERNMENT of Papua New Guinea yesterday gave the go-ahead for CRA, the
Australian mining group, to reduce its stake in the troubled Mount Kare gold
project in PNG's highlands.
CRA plans to reduce its shareholding in the existing alluvial gold mining
operation from 51 per cent to 12.75 per cent by selling 12.75 per cent each
to Placer (PNG), Highlands Gold and Renison Goldfields. The remaining 49 per
cent shareholding will remain in the hands of Kare-Puga Development
Corporation, which represents local landowners.
Mr Rabbie Namaliu, PNG Prime Minister, said the move was a vote of
confidence in the country's resources industry.
The incoming partners are participants in the nearby Porgera gold mine,
which is managed by Placer. Each will also take a 25 per cent stake in the
hard rock prospecting authority surrounding the alluvial operations. CRA,
which is owns 100 per cent of the hard rock permit, will retain 25 per cent.
Placer, Highlands and Renison have undertaken to fund the next stage of hard
rock gold exploration in the area, and will finance the recommencement of
alluvial gold mining at Mount Kare. Alluvial mining was stopped in January
after an attack on the site by an armed gang. CRA, which is 49 per cent
owned by RTZ of the UK, says production will not restart until the safety of
staff can be assured.
