LOCAL; 
LANCASTER WOMAN HELD IN SHOOTING 
A Lancaster woman was arrested and held without bail this morning after she 
allegedly shot a man to death because she believed he was providing her 
17-year-old daughter with drugs, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
said. 
Belita Fox, 40, was arrested about 1 a.m. in a house on 5th Street East after 
she called 911 and said, "There has been a murder," Deputy George Ducoulombier 
said. 
Deputies arrived at the house and found Kevin Furman, 23, dead in a bedroom. He 
had been shot three times, Ducoulombier said. Deputies said there were at least 
three other people in the house at the time of the shooting but did not 
disclose whether Fox's daughter was among them.
