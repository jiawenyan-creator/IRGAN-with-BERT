  [Text] Haris Silajdzic, the prime minister of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, today spoke on the phone with U.S. State 
Secretary Warren Christopher. Silajdzic warned Christopher 
about the critical situation in Gorazde. The aggressor has been 
attacking the town center and civilians in Gorazde. News 
reaching the U.S. public is not true. Something needs to be 
done urgently in order to save the lives of the tens of 
thousands of people, Silajdzic said among other things. Talking 
to Christopher, he stressed that reports said there were many 
wounded, and civilians were completely unprotected. According to 
Silajdzic, it is not only the credibility of the United Nations 
and NATO that is at stake, but also the credibility of the world 
democratic order.
