CLIPBOARD; 
HOW TO REPORT A MALFUNCTIONING TRAFFIC SIGNAL 
It is frustrating. There you are sitting at a traffic signal, waiting for it to 
change. You watch what seems to be a thousand cars whiz by, and still no 
change. You go into reverse and run over the electronic loop, hoping to 
activate the signal in your favor, but still no change. You get so irritated 
you get out of the car and go press the crosswalk button. 
And still no change. 
You finally give up and whip through a nearby gas station in disgust. 
Don't let it end there, because you just might find yourself sitting at that 
particular signal again. 
In every city of the county, motorists can report malfunctioning and mistimed 
traffic signals. The county has a traffic engineering division to do the same 
for signals in the unincorporated areas. 
Caltrans will respond to complaints about signals on state-maintained roads 
such as Pacific Coast Highway, Coast Highway, Imperial Highway, Laguna Canyon 
Road and most of Beach Boulevard. 
The number of complaint calls about traffic signals varies considerably from 
city to city, from 50 a week in Newport Beach to one or two a month in the 
smaller cities, traffic officials say. 
Complaints range from seemingly mistimed signals to non-working left-turn 
arrows; from an out-of-whack rotationto a light that has gone out altogether 
(this last is the most dangerous situation of all, traffic officials say.) 
The fault does not always lie in the machinery, however. In some cases, the 
motorist failed to prompt the light by not running over the electronic loop in 
the road. 
Buena Park traffic engineer Herb Vargas said that there was one case in which 
the city resorted to painting the electronic loop so that motorists could see 
where to run over it. 
Then there are the complaints from drivers who think they were kept waiting far 
too long at a particular signal only to have a field check show that the signal 
is functioning normally. 
"Let's just say we get a number of calls that don't check out to be what was 
reported," said Ron Garrett, traffic engineering technician in Newport Beach. 
Although many cities have central computer systems to monitor signals, through 
the electronic loop system, traffic officials must still rely on the public to 
report many problems. 
Here is a list of phone numbers to call to report mistimed and malfunctioning 
signals. You must be able to provide the place, the approximate length of time 
you waited there and the direction you were driving.
