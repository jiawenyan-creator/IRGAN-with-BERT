  [Text] Russia and Syria have concluded a number of military 
cooperation agreements in Damascus. Colonel General Mikhail 
Kolesnikov, the Russian chief of general staff, and his Syrian 
counterpart General Hikmat al-Shihabi signed twelve documents 
there on the expansion of links in the military sphere. 
  I remind you that a comprehensive agreement between the two 
countries was signed in April of this year. In particular it 
envisages the resumption of military deliveries to Syria, which 
were interrupted in 1991.
