  [Text] Deputy Commerce Minister Chaloemphon Sanitwongchai 
said during an interview with newsmen in Udon Thani Province 
that Thailand will certainly feel the impact from the lifting of 
the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam. Vietnam is quick to adjust 
and therefore likely to catch up with Thailand within five years 
despite the fact that Vietnam now is 20 years behind Thailand. 
He said the Vietnamese people are very diligent by nature. 
Vietnam is a big competitor of Thailand in rice exports, but 
the quality of Vietnam's rice is still lower than Thai rice. 
Thailand, he said, must try to improve the quality of its rice 
export, especially in terms of packaging.
