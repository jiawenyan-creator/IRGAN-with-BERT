FT  08 MAY 92 / Bellway buoyant as sales pick up
BELLWAY, the Tyneside-based builder, offered hope to a depressed housing
sector yesterday with the news that its sales had picked up in the few weeks
after the general election.
Mr Alan Robson, Bellway's finance director, said the upturn was apparent
across all of the group's trading regions, although the south of England was
still difficult. 'The present indications are that it is holding and perhaps
even improving slightly,' he said.
Sales were running more than 16 per cent ahead of the same time last year,
he said.
However, the north-east provided the backbone of Bellway's success in the
first half of this year. The group has bucked the trend of UK housebuilders'
results with a 28 per cent rise in trading profits to Pounds 4.1m for the
six months to January 31.
Interest gains of Pounds 1.4m, compared with Pounds 162,000 last time,
helped boost pre-tax profits by 63 per cent to Pounds 5.5m.
In spite of the encouraging results, Bellway maintained the dividend at 4p.
Mr Kenneth Bell, chairman, said if the latest signs of recovery proved not
to be a false dawn, the dividend would be increased 'at least in line with
inflation'. Earnings per share rose from 4.7p to 7.3p.
Bellway sold 698 homes during the first half, compared with 600 in the same
period last time. Of those sold this year, some 490 were in the north.
Turnover rose from Pounds 44.9m to Pounds 52.4m, which helped margins
advance 10 per cent to 7.8 per cent.
Mr Robson said the proceeds of the Pounds 25m rights issue last year had
been reinvested in land. During the first half Bellway spent about Pounds
20m, throughout the country and a further Pounds 20m in land purchases was
planned.
