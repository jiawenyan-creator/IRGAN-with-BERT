U.S. USERS AND COLOMBIAN 'WAR' 
My mother was born in Colombia. I have visited that great country on one 
occasion and I was very impressed with the sense of serenity and happiness of 
its citizens. Now the people are cowering, praying that the scourge of the 
narco-traffickers will end. 
I appeal to the citizens of this country, although not as eloquently as 
President Barco in his sobering world-wide appeal, that American drug users 
look into their hearts and know with each sorry sniff of cocaine it equates to 
a vote for repression and torture. 
Colombia suffers today because the coca plant is indigenous to the land; it 
grows without much nurturing or tending. For years the medicinal properties of 
cocaine were used for toothaches, pains, and the such. Colombians, by and 
large, are not afflicted with cocaine addiction. 
How I loathe the insolent attitude of all the crack smokers and cocaine 
sniffers. You are the cause of an entire nation's potential demise.
