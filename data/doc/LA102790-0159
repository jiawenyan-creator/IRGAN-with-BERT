COMPUTAINMENT: 'VETTE!' BRINGS MILES OF SMILES 
You wouldn't expect two people who spend three hours a day commuting to and 
from work to get a kick out of playing at racing through city traffic. But 
that's just what Spectrum HoloByte's "Vette!" is all about. 
And there's something downright appealing about it. 
Maybe it's the chance to trade the real-life Tempo in for a gas-guzzling, 
insurance rate-busting muscle car. Or maybe it's just the overall righteousness 
of major miles-per-hour on the streets of San Francisco. 
Whatever, this unpretentious little game fulfills a standard urban fantasy with 
relative simplicity, pretty good graphics and considerable technical 
sophistication. 
You drive one of four Corvettes on a street race through The City. You compete 
against the computer driving one of four other high-performance cars along 
courses that very closely duplicate the actual street layout of San Francisco. 
That's it. You win or lose based on your driving, nerve and ability to follow a 
map. 
And this no-brainer game is as much fun -- if not more -- if you forget about 
the race and just try your hand at maneuvering the city. For even if you are 
not especially into racing, you have to be taken by "Vette's" electronic 
mapping, which really sets this driving simulation apart from some similar 
games now hitting the game market. 
The attempt to replicate the street grid of San Francisco is impressive. Not 
perfect and not so advanced as to photographically reproduce every block of 
town, but few other games show so well both the reality and the potential of 
computer entertainment technology.
