FT  09 SEP 93 / Unions plan Tupe legal cases
THE TUC said yesterday that unions were 'trawling through potential cases'
to bring against the government retrospectively over the so-called Tupe
regulations.
Unions say the government, by introducing the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) regulations, has failed fully to implement a
European Community directive on the transfer of workers when businesses are
taken over.
