FT  08 OCT 92 / Effect on GKN 'is pretty small': Vehicle components
SIR DAVID LEES observes the slide of sterling with a certain detachment.
Ten years ago, GKN, the automotive components, engineering and industrial
services group of which he is chairman, earned two thirds of its revenues
from UK plants. Relish at the prospect of a short-term exports boom would
have been tempered by higher import costs and inflation.
Now, having pursued a 'globalisation' policy since the early 1980s, Sir
David says GKN is barely affected in trading terms. 'Because of
globalisation we are supplying our customers out of the same countries in
which they have their own plants, so the effect of devaluation is pretty
small.
'The very reason we globalised is that we could no longer risk the problems
of this type of fluctuation.'
As a result, says Sir David, GKN feels no need to make abrupt policy shifts
to take account of the weaker pound.
Out of GKN's total Pounds 1.95bn sales last year, only Pounds 649m was in
the UK, with Pounds 815m in continental Europe, Pounds 354m in the Americas
and Pounds 107m in the rest of the world.
Sir David sees a few potential benefits. There is the prospect of profits
made in Germany being worth more in sterling terms. 'But . . . the scope is
no longer there for GKN to obtain any great advantage from devaluation'.
There is one sizeable exception: GKN holds a 40 per cent stake in United
Engineering Steels, which will benefit substantially from the fact that
steel in Europe is primarily priced in D-Marks.
