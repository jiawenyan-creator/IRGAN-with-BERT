FT  02 SEP 92 / Freight company seeks new funding
CHARTERAIL, the pioneering rail-freight company which announced last week
that it was calling in liquidators, yesterday did an about-turn and renewed
efforts to stave off its collapse, Richard Tomkins writes.
Mr Robin Gisby, managing director, said the move followed a weekend during
which a range of potential shareholders had expressed interest in plugging
the company's funding gap.
Charterail announced that it was going into liquidation last Thursday after
British Rail, which owns 22 per cent of the company, declined to cut its
haulage rates or invest more money to ease the business's financial
difficulties.
A meeting of the company's directors yesterday was expected to result in the
appointment of liquidators. Instead, the directors decided to continue
efforts to find more funding and to reopen negotiations with BR over the
haulage agreement.
