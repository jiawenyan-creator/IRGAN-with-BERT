 Proposed rules.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We propose to revise the requirements of the Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) regulations
regarding the certifications required on disability determination forms. Determinations of disability are generally
made by disability determination services (DDS), which are agencies of each State. Present regulations require
that, unless the disability determination is made by a State agency disability hearing officer, disability determinations
made by a DDS will be made by a State agency medical or psychological consultant and a State agency disability examiner,
including those in which the determination is made on technical, non-medical, rather than medical, grounds. We propose
to remove the requirement that a medical or psychological consultant make the determination jointly with the disability
examiner when there is no medical evidence to be evaluated.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Social Security Act (the Act) provides, in title II, for the payment of disability benefits to individuals insured
under the Act. Title II also provides for the payment of child's insurance benefits based on disability and widow's
and widower's insurance benefits for disabled widows, widowers, and surviving divorced spouses of insured individuals.
In addition, the Act provides, in title XVI, for SSI payments to persons who are aged, blind, or disabled and who have
limited income and resources. For adults under both the title II and title XVI programs and for persons claiming child's
insurance benefits based on disability under the title II program, ``disability'' means the inability to engage
in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable impairment. For a child under age 18 claiming
SSI benefits based on disability, ``disability'' means that the child's impairment(s) is of comparable severity
to one that would disable an adult (i.e., the impairment(s) substantially reduces the child's ability to function
independently, appropriately, and effectively in an age-appropriate manner such that the child's impairment(s)
and resulting limitations are comparable to those that would disable an adult). Under both title II and title XVI,
disability must be the result of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment(s) which can be expected
to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. 




Sections 404.1503 and 416.903 of the Social Security Administration's regulations provide that State agencies
make disability and blindness determinations for the Secretary of Health and Human Services for most persons living
in the State. Sections 404.1615(c) and 416.1015(c) of the regulations provide that disability determinations will
be made by either: (1) A State agency medical or psychological consultant 

and 

a State agency disability examiner or (2) a State agency disability hearing officer. Sections 404.1615(e) and 416.1015(e)
of the regulations require the State agency to certify each determination of disability to the Social Security Administration
(SSA) on forms provided by SSA. The term ``determination of disability'' is defined in 404.1602 and
416.1002 of the regulations to mean one or more of the following decisions: whether or not a person is under a disability;
the date a person's disability began; or the date a person's disability ended. 

When a disability determination is made jointly by a State agency medical or psychological consultant and a State
agency disability examiner, the medical or psychological consultant is responsible for the medical portion of the
determination and the disability examiner is responsible for the remainder of the determination. Under our current
procedures, both the disability examiner and the medical or psychological consultant must certify the determination
on forms which we provide as required in the regulations.
