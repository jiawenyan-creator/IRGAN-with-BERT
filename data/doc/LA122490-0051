IN COURT: A SELECTED SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION 
DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK. 
Van Halen Sues 2 Live Crew Over Copyright: Heavy metal rock band Van Halen sued 
members of the rap group 2 Live Crew, contending that they illegally used part 
of the Van Halen hit "Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love" on a popular rap tune. In the 
federal suit, Van Halen Music Inc. said 2 Live Crew member David Hobbs admitted 
in a deposition last May that two of his group's tunes duplicated music in the 
Van Halen song. 
The suit asserts that 2 Live Crew has sold at least 2 million copies of the 
song in singles and on the albums "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" and "As Clean as 
They Wanna Be." In addition to damages for copyright infringement, the suit 
seeks $300,000 in damages for unfair competition. (Case No. 90- 6834. Filed 
Dec. 20, 1990).
