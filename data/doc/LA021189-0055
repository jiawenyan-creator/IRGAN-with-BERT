Shortstop Jose Uribe of the San Francisco Giants cannot leave the Dominican 
Republic for spring training until he stands trial on a rape charge, a district 
attorney said. 
A woman filed a complaint last month, accusing Uribe of drugging her beer at 
his discotheque, threatening her with a gun and forcing her to go to a hotel, 
where he raped her. Uribe denied the charge. A trial date has not been set.
