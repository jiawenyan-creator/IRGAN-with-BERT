FT  01 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Flawed sale of Rover Group
Sir, The announcement that the Rover Group is to be sold to BMW is beyond
belief. Those of us who remember how taxpayers' money was used to support
the ailing British Leyland now wonder what reward was gained from the
diversion of our hard-earned income]
It is absolutely inconceivable that the British government should have sold
to a German competitor a company that was just becoming viable and showing
the way to the European motor industry.
The government must act immediately to halt this flawed sale and insist that
overall control of the Rover Group remains in British hands.
