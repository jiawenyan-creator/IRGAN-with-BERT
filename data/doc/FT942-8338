FT  20 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee continues to defy
gravity
Coffee prices continued to defy gravity yesterday with nearby futures at the
London Commodity Exchange posting the biggest daily gains since the present
bull run began less than one month and more than Dollars 800 ago.
The July position, which on Wednesday morning dipped to Dollars 2,030 a
tonne in what most dealers thought was the beginning of a long-awaited
sell-off, closed last night at a fresh 5-year high of Dollars 2,247 a tonne,
up Dollars 128 on the day.
The market had opened modestly firmer, recouping what remained of the
previous day's fall, and it did not begin to levitate until after a
surprisingly strong opening in New York. That sucked in fresh trade and
investment fund buying, which met negligible selling resistance.
In New York the July price was 6.1 cents up in late trading at 131.1 cents a
pound. Some traders said a close above 130 cents could herald a further
10-cent rise, but others were doubtful. 'You can't keep rising in more or
less a straight line day after day,' one told the Reuter news agency.
