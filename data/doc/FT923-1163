FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Secure Tst rises 10% to Pounds 3.4m
SECURE TRUST, the financial services group, recorded a 9.8 per cent jump in
interim pre-tax profits despite the impact of the recession.
Profits in the six months to June 30 rose to Pounds 3.44m (Pounds 3.13m).
Earnings per share rose 11 per cent to 16.1p (14.5p) and the interim
dividend is increased to 4p (3.5p).
The company, which specialises in household budget management, experienced
an increase in its bad debt ratio from 1 to 1.25 per cent. It also saw a
reduction in its interest income, due to falling base rates, and there was
no growth in the number of customers using its budgeting service because of
the poor state of the economy.
These factors were more than offset, however, by selling new products,
including loans to the existing customer base and by the growth of
commission income resulting from the acquisition of OBC Insurance
Consultants. Arbuthnot Fund Managers made a small profit.
