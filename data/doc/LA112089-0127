SHORT TAKES; 
MURPHY'S 'HARLEM NIGHTS' TOPS RECORD BOX OFFICE WEEKEND 
Eddie Murphy's "Harlem Nights" led a blockbuster weekend in the box office that 
broke all fall and winter non-holiday weekend records, according to 
Entertainment Data, Inc. Early estimates for the Top 10 pictures are $50 
million, up 43% for the same weekend last year. Despite soft reviews, 
Paramount's "Harlem Nights" grossed $16 million on 2,180 screens -- the second 
highest Thanksgiving / Christmas film debut behind the $19.9 million opening of 
"Rocky 4" in 1985. 
After four weeks in the No. 1 slot, Tri-Star's "Look Who's Talking" slipped a 
notch with a weekend take of $8.5 million. Disney's animated instant-classic 
"The Little Mermaid" opened strongly at $6 million, followed by Tri-Star's 
ensemble drama "Steel Magnolias," which grossed $5.6 million on 480 screens for 
a strong $11,303 per screen. Don Bluth's "All Dogs Go To Heaven" (MGM/UA) 
finished No. 5 with $4.7 million. 
In limited release, Orion's "Valmont" -- director Milos Forman's version of 
"Les Liaisons Dangereuses" -- opened quietly on seven screens and grossed an 
estimated $100,000 for a per-screen average of $14,285. In comparison, last 
year's "Dangerous Liaisons" by director Stephen Frears averaged $28,150 on 
three screens over the four-day holiday weekend of Dec. 23.
