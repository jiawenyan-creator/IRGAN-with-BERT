A man assembling a bomb in a West London hotel blew himself up, police said. 
The explosion tore through the small five-story Beverley House hotel in 
Paddington, blasting a hole in the roof and starting a fire but causing no 
other casualties. Anti-terrorist squad Commander George Churchill-Coleman told 
reporters, "It (the blast) was caused by some form of improvised explosive 
device." Churchill-Coleman ruled out an Irish connection after detectives 
established that the dead man was from the Middle East. Security forces are on 
the alert ahead of the 20th anniversary of the dispatch of British troops to 
Northern Ireland, where guerrillas of the Irish Republican Army are fighting to 
end British rule.
