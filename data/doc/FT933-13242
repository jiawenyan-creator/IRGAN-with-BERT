FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Consortium to advise on NSC
privatisation
A consortium has been formed to advise on the forthcoming privatisation of
National Steel Corporation, the largest steel producer in the Philippines.
It will include Beddows &amp; Company, the international consulting firm, which
is teaming up with financial advisers Barclays de Zoete Wedd and All Asia
Capital. They expect to complete a study by early September recommending the
method of privatisation.
The privatisation of NSC is an important part of President Fidel Ramos'
programme to eliminate state presence in business, and is aimed at
positioning the company to take advantage of growth in steel demand in
south-east Asia.
The government said last month it expected to generate 10bn pesos (Dollars
377.3m) from the sale of NSC. The proceeds would be used to settle NSC's
maturing debts and help finance the establishment of an integrated steel
plant, expected to cost at least Dollars 1.9bn.
NSC has been modernising and upgrading its facilities. But it still relies
on imported slabs to make hot strip and tin mill products.
An integrated steel plant would allow the company to reduce its dependence
on imports, and cut the Philippines' foreign exchange bill.
