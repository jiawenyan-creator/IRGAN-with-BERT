FT  10 JAN 94 / Observer: Greasy pole
No wonder the shares in state-owned banks are missing out on the current
bullish run at the Athens Stock Exchange.
The fact that the Greek Socialist government is replacing the chairmen of
half a dozen state-controlled banks with its henchmen is itself
unremarkable. But eyebrows were raised even in Athenian banking circles when
none other than Soulis Apostolopoulos pitched up as the new chairman of Bank
of Attica, a small state bank specialising in trade with the rest of the
Balkans.
Until recently, Apostolopoulos, who headed a Greek state trading agency,
ITCO, during the Socialists' last turn in the 1980s, was in jail. He had
been convicted of fraud relating to the Great Maize Scandal of 1990, when
the Greek government had to pay a Dollars 2.4m fine because ITCO sold a
cargo of Yugoslav maize to Belgium, using forged Greek certificates of
origin to avoid paying EU countervailing levies.
Another, er, surprise is the return of Panayotis Korliras as chairman of
Greece's third biggest bank, Ionian Bank, a job he held under the previous
Socialist administration. All have not forgotten how, during his watch at
the parent company, a luxury hotel on Rhodes was built by the bank's
subsidiary, Ionian Hotels. For the past two years, the latter has been
trying to dispose of the edifice, which cost Dr14bn to put up, a piffling
Dr10bn over budget.
