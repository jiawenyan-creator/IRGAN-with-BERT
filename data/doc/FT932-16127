FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: RJB Mining brings flotation forward
RJB MINING, the Nottinghamshire-based coal mining group, has brought forward
its floatation to May or June to take advantage of the impending
privatisation of British Coal.
Mr Richard Budge, chief executive, said: 'The planned flotation will help us
expand the group's business at a time when there are significant
opportunities for private mining companies to operate underground mines
which BC will cease to run.'
Before the government's recent white paper on coal, the company was expected
to float at the end of 1993 or the beginning of next year. The white paper
said BC must license to the private sector any pits it does not want.
The flotation is expected to capitalise the company at more than Pounds
100m. In the year to December 31 it increased operating profits from Pounds
14.2m to Pounds 16.4m on sales of Pounds 73.9m.
RJB has signed a five year contract to supply National Power and an interim
agreement to supply PowerGen. Last year it produced 1.9m tonnes of coal,
equivalent to about 10 per cent of UK opencast coal production.
