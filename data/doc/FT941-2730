FT  18 MAR 94 / Vehicle financing deals up sharply
Sales of vans and other light commercial vehicles bought on hire purchase or
other forms of finance leapt by more than half last month, providing a
further sign of returning business confidence, particularly among small
traders.
Finance sales of new light commercial vehicles rose 51.2 per cent. This was
narrowly eclipsed by finance sales of used commercials, which jumped 52.6
per cent.
Statistics from HPI, the vehicle credit information organisation, show a
47.8 per cent rise in finance sales of used trucks and other heavy
commercial vehicles, and a rise of 22 per cent in finance sales of new heavy
commercial vehicles.
Sales on finance of new cars jumped 34.1 per cent last month, and those of
used cars by 23.1 per cent.
This brought to 171,373 the total of sales on finance of new cars in the
first two months of this year. This was 27.3 per cent higher than the same
period of last year.
Used-car finance sales in the same period were 182,236, a 22.4 per cent rise
on the same period a year ago.
The statistics issued by HPI show that 63.3 per cent of all new cars sold
last month were the subject of some form of finance agreement.
