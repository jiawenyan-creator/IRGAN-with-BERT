FT  24 MAR 92 / Fujimori strengthens Tokyo links
PERU'S President Alberto Fujimori has returned from an eight-day visit to
Japan, the land of his ancestors, with an immediate Dollars 127m (Pounds
73.4m) in credits for machinery and equipment purchase and financial sector
support.
He claimed his trip, which was concluded at the weekend, had 'removed the
barriers preventing a more fluid relationship with Japan'.
Mr Fujimori became the first Latin American president and only the third
foreigner in 50 years to address the Diet, or parliament. The credits, which
are likely to be followed swiftly by Dollars 200m in export guarantee
credits, mean Japan has become Peru's principal foreign funding source,
accounting for 'well over Dollars 550m in under 12 months', said Mr
Fujimori.
This contrasts with what is perceived in Peru as US stinginess.
