FT  04 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: CU call hint
Insurer Commercial Union sparked increasing tension in the market as the
deadline for the group's long awaited cash- raising issue became a matter of
ever closer scrutiny.
CU is scheduled to report figures on August 10 and is expected to announce
the details of its Pounds 1.46bn acquisition of Groupe Victoire, the
insurance arm of Compagnie de Suez. CU needs to acquire Pounds 500m of new
equity, some two-thirds of which is expected to be raised through the
market.
It is believed CU will bring its figures forward to pre-empt its rivals in
the sector - General Accident is the first to report on August 9. Mr Roman
Cizdyn of Smith New Court said: 'Any horrible surprises from the other
composites could spoil the ground.'
CU was up 11 at 550p yesterday, although General Accident fell 10 to 594p as
investors wanting to maintain their sector weightings sold stock elsewhere
in preparation to take advantage of the CU cash call.
The regional electricity companies (recs) powered ahead as strong rumours
swept the market that next week's regulatory review would turn out highly
favourable for the industry.
The speculation suggested that Offer, the industry watchdog, would deliver a
downward price rebasing of 14 per cent - against market fears of 20 per cent
 -and an annual price increase of two points below the rate of inflation,
against worries of a figure of RPI minus four. Mr Andrew Wheeler at NatWest
Securities said: 'While not subscribing to these rumours, if true, the
sector represents outrageously good value.'
Among the recs, Northern closed 16 ahead at 705p, East Midlands 23 up at
658p and South West 18 higher at 656p. Meanwhile, PowerGen announced that it
was buying in 2.5m of its own shares at 527p apiece. The stock shot forward
on the news, adding 25 1/2 at 545 1/2 p. PowerGen has shareholder approval
to buy in a further 75m shares.
Shares in British Airways advanced 9 to 430p after the airline reported an
8.1 per cent year-on-year increase in traffic figures for the month of July.
Nervous trading ahead of the figures held the stock back from fully
participating in Tuesday's strong advance in the market. The figures for
June beat market expectations, but those for April and May were a
disappointment.
There was strong demand for conglomerate Tomkins as the market came to the
view that the stock had been left behind. The shares advanced 8 to 233 1/2 p
in trade of 6.6m. Williams Holdings eased 5 to 367p as some dealers switched
out of the stock and into Tomkins.
Engineering group Glynwed International closed 3 firmer at 385p ahead of
today's interim figures.
Oil leaders were weak on profit-taking, particularly in the US, and a dull
oil price. Those two factors managed to offset a tentative buy note on
British Petroleum from Mr John Toalster of SGST. The long-time bear moved
from hold to undervalued and upgraded his 1994 replacememnt cost forecast to
Pounds 1.48bn from Pounds 1.4bn. BP dropped 8 to 410 1/2 p and Shell
Transport slipped 6 to 740p.
Advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi surged 9 1/2 to 159p after winning the
Qantas airline and Compaq computer accounts, which are expected to bring
billings of more than Pounds 60m. The news comes ahead of figures on Tuesday
which are expected to show full-year profits of about Pounds 13.3m.
Paper and packaging group Jefferson Smurfit jumped 18 to 396p after
acquiring the paper interests of French glassmaker St Gobain for IPounds
683.8m.
