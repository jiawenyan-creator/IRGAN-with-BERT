  [Text] Moscow, February 1 (XINHUA) -- Russia and the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are ready to widen military 
cooperation, according to the head of the Russian armed forces 
general staff. 
  Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov told visiting NATO 
supreme 
allied commander in Europe Henning von Ondarza today: "Our 
general staff is studying the Partnership for Peace Program, 
which contains good ideas and will boost our rapprochement with 
NATO." 
  The Partnership for Peace Program, proposed by U.S. 
President 
Bill Clinton at a NATO meeting in Brussels early January, was 
later discussed during Clinton's summit talks with Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow. 
  Kolesnikov advised Von Ondarza of the peace-making efforts 
of 
Russian troops in the former Yugoslavia, the Pridnestr region, 
Tajikistan and other regions of the former Soviet Union, the 
ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY reported. 
  As he arrived in Moscow for a four day visit, General von 
Ondarza said NATO intends to discuss details of cooperation with 
Russia. 
  He has so far met Russian Army commander-in-chief 
Colonel-General Vladimir Semyonov, visited the Kantemirovskaya 
Guard Tank Division and acquainted himself with combat training 
and military routine. 
  Kolesnikov said the Russian Defense Ministry hopes the 
contact will improve planning, organization, preparation and 
implementation of peace-keeping operations that involve Russian 
units. 
  According to well-informed sources here, a draft program for 
Russian-NATO military cooperation from 1994 was discussed at a 
meeting between the Russian Defense Ministry and NATO last week 
in Moscow. 
  The draft includes 50 military arrangements, namely exchange 
visits of Russian and NATO military command and experts, joint 
exercises and training, training of Russian officers at NATO 
units and educational establishments and mutual invitations to 
military exercises.
