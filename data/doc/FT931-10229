FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Investment plan approved
JAPAN'S ministry of finance yesterday approved brokers' plans to launch a
new cumulative stock investment scheme for retail investors next month.
Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko, Yamaichi Securities and three second-tier brokers will
offer a scheme that allows individuals to invest a minimum Y10,000 (Dollars
80) in a specific stock.
Currently, stocks can only be bought in units of 100 to 1,000 shares, and
most retail clients use investment trust funds. Under the new scheme,
investors will pay brokers between one and three instalments a month to
invest in one issue. The brokers will pool these funds to buy specific
stocks, paying the dividends according to the investors' amounts of
cumulative investment.
