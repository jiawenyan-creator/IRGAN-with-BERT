FT  25 NOV 93 / Pressure for Japan discount rate cut resisted
Japan's central bank yesterday resisted pressure for another cut in the
official discount rate, despite a continued slide in industrial output.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, admitted to 'grave concern'
about the continued falls in share prices, which brought the Nikkei index
down another 1.8 per cent yesterday. A fall of 317.73 points to 17,067.11
reflected deepening gloom about Japanese industry's poor profits outlook.
Shares opened firmer today, with the Nikkei more than 100 points higher
after five minutes of trading.
Mr Mieno, responding to suggestions that the bank might be considering
another cut in its main rate, already at a record low, said yesterday: 'In
the current economic adjustment phase, lower interest rates alone will not
create fresh demand.'
As he spoke, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry disclosed that
industrial production dropped by 3.8 per cent year-on-year in the third
quarter, the eighth quarterly decline running.
Worryingly, inventories were 1.1 per cent higher at the end of September
than three months earlier. This indicates that production will stay sluggish
at least until the end of the year, Miti said.
To worsen the gloom, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association
announced the sharpest monthly drop in vehicle production for 19 years.
Vehicle output, which with car sales is an important indicator of consumer
sentiment, plunged 15.7 per cent in October from a year earlier.
Mr Mieno saw no sign of a general economic recovery, but doubted that a the
recession would develop into a 'worsening spiral'.
The central bank had 'taken all necessary steps in terms of monetary
policy,' after cutting its main rate seven times since July 1991, to 1.75
per cent.
