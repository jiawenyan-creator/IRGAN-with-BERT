FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sears loses CDollars 91m on
slower sales
SEARS Canada, one of the two biggest Canadian retail groups, lost CDollars
91m (USDollars 72m), or CDollars 1.04 a share, in 1992 on sales 3 per cent
lower at CDollars 4bn.
Last year's Christmas shopping season was disappointing, Sears said. In
1991, it lost CDollars 29m. The latest period included CDollars 46m in
restructuring charges.
Retailers can now open on Sundays in Ontario and Quebec. Over the past 15
months the Canadian dollar has fallen 12 per cent against the US dollar. Mr
Joseph Reddington, Sears president, said these factors had reduced the flow
of Canadians crossing the border to shop in the US.
Sears Canada has closed two catalogue distribution centres. Birks, the
Canadian jewellery chain will get a cash infusion from Italy's Borgosesia
group. It will keep 38 stores open, having closed 73 stores last year when
it sought bankruptcy protection.
