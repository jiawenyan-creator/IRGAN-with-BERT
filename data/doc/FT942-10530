FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: BCP tops SKr296m for first
quarter
BCP, the Swedish consumer products group which Volvo is to sell, yesterday
announced a SKr296m (Dollars 38.44m) profit after financial items for the
first three months.
The result compares with a profit of SKr333m in the same period last year
when the result was boosted by a SKr350m gain from a disposal.
BCP was formed in late 1992 after the break-up of Procordia, a drugs-to-food
group jointly controlled by the Swedish state and Volvo. Volvo owns 74 per
cent of the company and has launched a bid for the balance. It then intends
to sell the group - to focus on transport.
BCP includes Swedish Match and many of Sweden's best-known food and drink
brands.
BCP's first-quarter group income fell 4 per cent to SKr4.85bn, reflecting
the sale of Swedish Match's confectionery activities. Operating income
dropped to SKr322m from SKr410m.
Swedish Match saw sales fall to SKr1.77bn from SKr1.96bn, but profits from
continuing activities more than doubled to SKr255m from SKr118m. The
improvement stemmed from a recovery in Swedish tobacco sales.
Procordia Food &amp; Beverages, the group's other main division, saw sales
expand to SKr2.34bn from SKr2.24bn, but profits from continuing operations
fell marginally to SKr59m from SKr62m.
