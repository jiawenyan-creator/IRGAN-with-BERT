FT  18 MAR 92 / Observer: Roll up
Swiss claims on Scottish territory are about to be diminished by the sale of
the island of Gigha, off the Mull of Kintyre. Savills has been asked to sell
it by Interallianz Bank of Switzerland which took possession of it as
creditor of a property company named Tanap Investments UK.
The man behind Tanap is Malcolm Potier, who lives in Kent and has commercial
holdings in several Scottish towns. He bought Gigha (pronounced gear) for
Pounds 5.4m in 1989 from David Landale, secretary to the Duchy of Cornwall
which is responsible for the Prince of Wales's property.
The island's six square miles include a mansion, hotel, fish-farm, and grass
airstrip, not to mention gardens where camellias and rhododendrons flourish
in the frost-free air of the Gulf Stream.
Guy Galbraith of Savills in Edinburgh is not stating an asking price. He's
relying on the Scottish system of asking for sealed bids and setting a
closing date to work its usual magic, even at times like these.
