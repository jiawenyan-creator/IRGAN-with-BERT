FT  31 OCT 92 / French jobless up
FRANCE'S unemployed, the government's main economic and political problem,
rose by 1 per cent to 2.9m last month, wiping out the marked fall in August.
The rise brings the September unemployment rate to 10.3 per cent, from 10.2
per cent in the previous month, well above the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development average of 7.5 per cent in August. Mrs Martine
Aubry, the labour minister, blamed the increase on a jump in redundancies
and the end of more temporary work contracts than usual.
This means the number of French unemployed has risen by 4.9 per cent over
the past year. The outlook for a revival in employment is poor.
