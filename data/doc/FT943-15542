FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Jurys' Pounds 6m Bristol acquisition
Jurys Hotel Group yesterday announced its third acquisition in the UK with
the Pounds 6m purchase of the 245-bedroom Unicorn, in Bristol.
The Ireland-based hotel operator also announced a 60 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits for the year to end-April, from IPounds 2.32m to IPounds
3.72m (Pounds 3.67m).
The Bristol deal follows the purchase of the Jurys Pond Hotel in Glasgow and
the Jurys Kensington Hotel. The latter deal was funded mainly by an IPounds
7.59m rights issue at the end of 1993. The balance of the Pounds 9.8m
consideration came from borrowings.
The latest move will be financed through debt.
Sales in the 12 months increased by 28 per cent to IPounds 33.6m (IPounds
26.3m). Operating profit rose to IPounds 5.13m (IPounds 3.97m). Earnings
were 11.1p (7.2p).
A final dividend of 3.25p is proposed, making a total of 5.15p (5p).
