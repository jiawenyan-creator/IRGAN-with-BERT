24 LAWMAKERS LINKED TO SECRET POLICE 
Twenty-four members of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere's party in Parliament 
once worked for the Stasi, the now-disbanded secret police in East Germany, two 
newspapers reported Saturday. A key party official denied the reports. 
The East Berlin newspaper Der Morgen, in reporting on the alleged connection, 
said it based its information on a letter sent to 24 members of the Christian 
Democratic Union faction in Parliament. 
Der Morgen said the 24 received a letter from Guenter Krause, the party's 
parliamentary faction chairman, in which he asked them not to take on any 
"important political mandate" in a future all-German parliament. 
The newspaper said the letter followed background checks on all 
parliamentarians for possible Stasi connections. 
Der Morgen said several high-ranking party leaders confirmed the letter's 
existence. A respected Munich-based newspaper, Sueddeutsche Zeitung, carried a 
similar report. 
Neither newspaper named the 24 parliamentarians in question. The Christian 
Democrats won 164 seats in the 400-seat Parliament in East Germany's first free 
election on March 18 following a democratic revolution.
