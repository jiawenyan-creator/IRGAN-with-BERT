 

II. Introduction




A. The Municipal Securities Market 



As detailed in the recent Staff Report on the Municipal Securities Market, the market for municipal securities is
characterized by great diversity and high volume. Issuers, estimated to number approximately 50,000, include state
governments, cities, towns, counties, and special subdivisions, such as special purpose districts and public authorities.
It is estimated that there currently are 1.3 million municipal issues outstanding, representing approximately
$1.2 trillion in securities.

2

 In 1993, a record level of over $335 billion in municipal securities was sold, representing over 17,000 issues. This
record financing was heavily influenced by refundings. Nevertheless, the level of long term new money financings,
representing 49% of financings for the year, reflected continued growth. In 1993, there were $142 billion of new money
long term financings, compared to $81 billion in 1988, a 75% increase.

In recent years, the forms of securities used to meet the financing needs of these issuers have become increasingly
diverse and complex. For example, conduit bonds, certificates of participation, and a variety of derivative products
have joined traditional general obligation and revenue bonds as prevalent forms of municipal financing.

In addition, there has been a change in the investor profile in the municipal securities market. By 1992, individual
investors, including those holding through mutual funds, held 75% of the municipal debt outstanding, compared to
44% in 1983.

Along with the changing investor profile, there has been a change in investor strategy. Traditionally, municipal
bondholders have been buy and hold investors; however, this strategy has changed significantly with the growth and
development of municipal bond funds. Many of these funds actively trade their portfolio securities to take advantage
of market conditions or to meet redemption needs. 



B. SEC Oversight of the Municipal Securities Market 



As the agency charged with administering the federal securities laws and overseeing this nation's securities markets,
the Commission has an obligation to protect investors in the municipal markets from fraud, including misleading
disclosures. As the New York City report stated nearly two decades ago: 







By virtue of the large dollar volume of municipal securities issued and outstanding each year, such securities are
a major factor in the Nation's economy and the national securities markets. In light of the national scope of the municipal
securities markets, there is an overriding federal interest in assuring that there is adequate disclosure of all
material information by issuers of municipal securities. 

Although municipalities have certain unique attributes by virtue of their political nature, insofar as they are
issuers of securities, they are subject to the proscription against false and misleading disclosures.

The burgeoning volume and complexity of municipal securities offerings, as well as the retail nature of the market,
heighten the need for market participants to seek to prevent fraud through the timely provision of material information
concerning municipal issuers and securities. 

While Congress exempted offerings of municipal securities from the registration requirements and civil liability
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933,

7

 and a mandated system of periodic reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,

8

 it did not exempt transactions in municipal securities from the coverage of the antifraud provisions of section 17(a)
of the Securities Act,

9

 section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b5 promulgated thereunder.

10

 These antifraud provisions prohibit any person, including municipal issuers and brokers, dealers and municipal
securities dealers, from making a false or misleading statement of material fact, or omitting any material facts
necessary to make statements made by that person not misleading, in connection with the offer, purchase or sale of
any security. In addition, brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers are subject to regulations adopted
by the Commission, including those regulations adopted to define and prevent fraud.

11

 Municipal securities dealers are also subject to rules promulgated by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
(``MSRB'').

C. Disclosure Practices and Calls for Enhanced Disclosure 



In the absence of a statutory scheme for municipal securities registration and reporting, disclosure by municipal
issuers has been governed by the demands of market participants and antifraud strictures. Spurred by the New York
City fiscal crisis in 1975 and the Washington Public Power Supply System defaults,

13

 participants in the municipal securities market have developed extensive guidance to improve the level and quality
of disclosure in primary offerings of municipal securities, and to a more limited extent, continuing disclosure
in the secondary market.
