CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SAN FRANCISCO; 
DELAY IN RETRIAL OF JUDGE AGUILAR 
A respiratory infection caused a two-day delay in the retrial of U.S. District 
Judge Robert Aguilar on corruption charges. 
The trial judge, U.S. District Judge Louis Bechtle, granted the delay after 
ordering an examination of Aguilar, 59, by a doctor other than his own. Aguilar 
was charged in 1989 with eight counts of using his judicial office to influence 
other judges in handling cases involving Aguilar's friends. The first trial 
ended May 19 with acquittal on one count of conspiracy and jurors deadlocked on 
the seven other counts. The second trial has been trimmed to four counts.
