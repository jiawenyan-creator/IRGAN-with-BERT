ALLA BREVE 
MARSHALL: "THREE PENITENTIAL VISIONS," "HIDDEN VOICES." With soprano Cheryl 
Bensman Rowe. 
Nonesuch 9 79227-2 (compact disc). "Hidden Voices" is filled with cries and 
whispers, electronically sampled from various sources and processed in digital 
loops, with the distant purity of Rowe's soaring hymn only the icing on a 
complex confection. Art and craft are all of a part in Ingram Marshall's work, 
in a seemingly inevitable union of music and means. More traditionally 
developed, atmospheric tapescapes, the "Penitential Visions" share Marshall's 
love of bells with the "Visions." JOHN HENKEN
