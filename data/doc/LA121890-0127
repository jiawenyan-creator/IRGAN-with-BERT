ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; 
BACK-TO-NATURE WALKS SCHEDULED 
If you think walking in Orange and Los Angeles counties must include dodging 
exhaust-spewing cars, the Irvine Community Services Department would like to 
get you back to nature. 
Beginning Jan. 19, city recreation workers will lead walkers on monthly tours 
along trails that pass bubbling creeks, waterfalls, flowers and animals. The 
all-day tours will continue Feb. 16, March 2 and March 30. 
Excursions will leave University Community Park at 8 a.m. each day and return 
about 4 p.m. Cost for the tours is $25. To register, call (714) 724-6609.
