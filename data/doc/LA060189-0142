METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL ASKS REVIEW OF 1991 PAY RAISE 
The Los Angeles City Council asked a committee Wednesday to review a proposed 
pay raise for elected officials that could hike salaries up to 53% by 1991 if 
approved by voters. 
Councilwoman Joy Picus, who chairs the Personnel and Labor Relations Committee, 
said the review may be delayed for several months until an ethics panel 
appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley can make recommendations about outside 
employment and other key issues. 
The proposal, which would tie council salaries to those of Municipal Court 
judges and ultimately lead to a 53% increase by 1991, is part of a package of 
recommendations made by the city's Official Salaries Authority. 
Another key recommendation is that none of the city's elected officials -- the 
mayor, the city attorney, the city controller, and the 15 council members -- 
would accept outside employment. 
Picus said there is some concern among council members that "this wasn't the 
best year to be discussing" the large pay hike.
