  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina today 
delivered to Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet a message 
from Commander in Chief Fidel Castro in which Castro expresses 
gratitude for Vietnam's gestures of solidarity. Vo Van Kiet 
pointed out that the traditional ties of brotherhood between the 
two nations have transcended the borders of time and 
formalities, to move toward new modalities that will permit the 
development of both nations. He then added that the Cubans have 
given Vietnam enormous support in the past and stressed that now 
the Vietnamese people are ready to do everything they can for 
their beloved friends. 
  For his part, Robaina said it is a privilege to have his 
Asian tour end in Vietnam, a country for which we feel special 
admiration and respect because of its remarkable economic 
achievements of the last few years.
