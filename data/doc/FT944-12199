FT  02 NOV 94 / World Commodities Prices: Gold price slide halted - Market
report
The London GOLD price was a shade firmer yesterday afternoon after a shaky
morning spent in the aftershock of Monday's fund-driven sell-off. At Dollars
383.75 a troy ounce the price was still 75 cents down at the close, but that
was 30 cents off the low.
Dealers said there was a sprinkling of fund buying to help the New York
market firm in very light business. 'A bit if physical interest has
triggered some short-covering as well,' one added.
'Once a floor is in place, we could see the investors coming back again,'
said another, adding that physical offtake alone would be insufficient to
rally the market.
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures reversed an early rally as talk
circulated that a new independent forecast for Brazil's 1995-96 crop might,
like one by US banker Morgan Stanley, be far higher than most recent
estimates.
Morgan Stanley forecast Brazil's 1995-96 crop at between 20m and 22m bags
(60kg each).
That figure was well out of line with Brazil's own preliminary estimates of
between 13m and 15m bags. But traders said that the market could not ignore
rumours of that kind.
OIL prices rallied meanwhile as traders rushed to buy ahead of what they
expected to be a bullish report on US primary oil stocks.
Market players said that the American Petroleum Institute was likely to
report big falls in US petroleum products stocks, reflecting the impact of
pipeline disruptions after widespread flooding in the Houston area.
