HEALING GESTURE 
I would like to thank you for the words of encouragement I read in your 
editorial ("Parents' Touch Helps the Healing," Jan. 31). 
In it you praised the generosity of Giusto and Evelyn DeMaiti for setting up a 
foundation to grant college scholarships to minority students as a way of 
easing the racial tension created by the tragic circumstances of their 
daughter's death in Boston. The final sentence read " . . . Decent people 
determined to do the right thing can make a difference, however long the odds 
against them." 
You're right, of course, but I needed to be reminded. I feel renewed and ready 
to continue my efforts for the pro-life cause. Thank you.
