FT  17 OCT 94 / Citizen's Charter an 'irrelevance'
The government's Citizen's Charter scheme is a publicity stunt which is
being used by only a handful of people, says a survey today.
A poll of 1,000 people by NOP for the Trades Union Congress found only 2 per
cent had used one of the charters, set up to improve public services,
including British Rail.
Only one in three had seen a copy of the charters, just one in 10 had read
the documents - and only 16 people said they were satisfied with them.
Two out of three people questioned described the charter as a 'public
relations exercise'.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said: 'Our poll shows that the
Citizen's Charter is an expensive irrelevance which plays no part in
delivering quality in our public services.
'It goes unseen, unread and unused by a vast majority of British citizens.
Taxpayers' money would be better spent on funding services properly.'
The survey also found resistance to private companies running public
services such as hospitals, schools, leisure facilities and refuse
collection.
Mr Monks said: 'These findings support the view of trade unions that the
privatisation of our public services does not have the backing of those who
pay for them and use them.'
The poll was released as part of the TUC's public services week, which is
aimed at highlighting cuts in public spending and the effects of
privatisation.
As part of the campaign, leaders of the three rail unions will tour the
country to complain that Pounds 700m has been 'wasted' on rail
privatisation.
