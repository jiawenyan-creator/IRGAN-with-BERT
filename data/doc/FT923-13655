FT  11 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Market to be made in HSBC's HKDollars
shares
AFTER SOME last minute arm-twisting, the London Stock Exchange yesterday
assembled a group of six market makers prepared to make sterling quotes in
HKDollars -denominated shares in HSBC Holdings, parent of Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank, just hours before they were due to start trading.
On Thursday, the original group of market makers pulled out after County
NatWest decided not to make sterling quotes of the HKDollars shares.
Hongkong Bank's shares are split between the UK (worth Pounds 2.6bn) and
Hong Kong (Pounds 5.6bn).
The plan to quote sterling prices in the HKDollars line, in addition to the
new sterling denominated shares, was abandoned because of concerns about low
volume, according to firms involved.
On Friday morning, James Capel, Hongkong Bank's broker, helped arrange group
of market makers, comprising Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Cazenove, James Capel,
Morgan Stanley International, Smith New Court and SG Warburg.
Sterling quotes on both lines of HSBC shares started at 2.30pm yesterday,
after Hongkong Bank's Pounds 3.6bn offer for Midland Bank became fully
unconditional.
Failure to assemble a group of market makers could have resulted in a change
to the planned weighting of HSBC in both the FT-SE 100 and FTA indices,
which might have depressed the share price.
In the event, the indices will take quotes from both lines on SEAQ, combined
to reflect the capital of the whole company, according to Mr Mark Makepeace,
secretary to the FT-SE steering committee.
'We did not know until (yesterday) morning that the decision on marketmaking
had implications for the index weighting,' said one market maker, adding
that this consideration helped tip the balance.
The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe)
yesterday launched equity options on sterling-denominated HSBC shares.
