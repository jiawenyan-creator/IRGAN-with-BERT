<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Rete Secretary Leoluca Orlando by </F>
Felice Cavallaro in Palermo; date not given: "Orlando Says No 
to Sad Martinazzoli, Believes La Malfa -- Under Investigation -- 
Should Stay at Home"] 
  [Text] Palermo -- The great left-wing agreement, with a 
view to setting up a progressive pole, will perhaps be reached 
next week at a negotiating "table" secretly convened over the 
past few days by Leoluca Orlando and [Green Party Coordinator] 
Carlo Ripa di Meana. The idea is to bring together left-wing 
movements and parties, ranging from AD [Democratic Alliance] to 
Communist Renaissance. The invitations have already been sent to 
attend a meeting at the Valdesi Institute, in Rome, on 13 
January -- a date worthy of a soccer match -- following the 
debate on the Ciampi government. There are many who are 
prepared to sit down at this table, though perhaps they will 
soon stand up again. Others have been excluded from the game 
even before it started, and the task of waiving little red cards 
[expulsion card in soccer] at so many different parties fell to 
Orlando. La Malfa [former Italian Republican Party secretary] 
is warming up on the sidelines, getting ready for a comeback 
into politics, but Orlando advised him to stay at home. A 
"stop" warning was also addressed to Martinazzoli [Christian 
Democratic Party, DC, secretary] and Del Turco [Italian 
Socialist Party secretary]. 
  [Cavallaro] Deputy Orlando, who is qualified to join the 
Left? 
  [Orlando] Anyone who did not represent, and does not now 
represent, the various existing parties. 
  [Cavallaro] What about Martinazzoli? 
  [Orlando] Sadly he is preparing to remain in a useless 
Center, having failed to understand that there is no Center any 
more. So much the worse for him. His voters have understood 
it, though. Some will support [DC neocentrist leader] Casini and 
[Fininvest President] Berlusconi, while others will back the 
progressive pole. 
  [Cavallaro] With whom would you like to see an agreement? 
  [Orlando] Certainly not with Del Turco. Rather, with 
Gorrieri's Christian-Socialists. Also, with Socialists such as 
Enzo Mattina -- all those who made a clean break at a time when 
such a move was not suspect -- the Greens, Rete, AD, PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left], Communist Renaissance. 
  [Cavallaro] When did you first think of this "table"? 
  [Orlando] On 18 December, at the Greens' National Council 
meeting. At that time I told Ripa di Meana: Bring along two 
legs, I have another two, so that together we can make a table 
at which we can sit and talk. 
  [Cavallaro] Is this a political agreement or an electoral 
pact? 
  [Orlando] The objective is a government platform for the 
next 
parliament. Otherwise, we are not interested. 
  [Cavallaro] Are you thinking in terms of the Palermo model? 
  [Orlando] I am hoping that we can break with the past as 
much 
as possible everywhere, as regards the moral issue -- and 
everywhere achieve the maximum possible unity of the Left. I am 
thinking of the 56 percent achieved by the Left -- a majority 
the first time around. 
  [Cavallaro] People talk of a fictitious Left, because your 
platform is rather conservative in economic terms. What are the 
progressives' distinctive characteristics? 
  [Orlando] The respect for diversity. For the progressives, 
diversity is a form of wealth, not an obstacle. This applies to 
the differences between north and south, as well as sexual, 
cultural, religious, social, and racial differences. The second 
point is respect for market rules, rather than the pirate raids 
that are presented as being the market. 
  [Cavallaro] Of course corrupt politicians and mafiosi are 
vetoed, but what about those under investigation? 
  [Orlando] We must respect the moral issue when drawing up 
the 
lists. 
  [Cavallaro] What about La Malfa proclaiming himself the 
saviour of the Left? 
  [Orlando] He certainly cannot stand as a candidate as long 
as 
he is still under investigation. 
  [Cavallaro] Will the presence of Communist Renaissance put 
off many people? 
  [Orlando] If Cossutta believes that the progressive pole 
must 
be conditioned by "real socialism" he will be forced to get up 
and leave. The same will apply, however, to those who choose to 
ignore the value of solidarity. 
  [Cavallaro] Who is in the right-wing camp? 
  [Orlando] Bossi [League secretary], Fini [Italian Social 
Movement secretary] and Casini, with Berlusconi acting as a 
binder. Of course, Casini could also be joined by someone like 
Segni [National Rebirth Pact leader], who nevertheless is 
clinging to the Center, probably because he is hoping to become 
prime minister and head a center-right government. I think his 
problem is: Who will make him prime minister? He tried already 
with [PDS Secretary Achille] Occhetto, and he will be trying 
with Berlusconi. 
  [Cavallaro] When did he try with Occhetto? 
  [Orlando] He tried, believe you me.... 
  [Cavallaro] And Occhetto never makes mistakes? 
  [Orlando] Some people see the progressive pole in terms of a 
train with many wagons, with the PDS acting as the locomotive. 
If Occhetto believes he is the engine pulling the wagons he 
runs the risk of becoming a dashing engine with no wagons. It 
would be a serious mistake if the progressive pole appeared to 
be dominated by an individual. 
  [Cavallaro] Does Occhetto risk being ousted by Orlando as 
the 
leader of the Left? 
  [Orlando] Let us be realistic. For the next four years, 
Orlando will be working as Palermo's mayor. Look, he is not 
even interested in standing as a candidate. He will not be 
requesting a constituency for himself, be it unilateral or 
proportional. 
  [Cavallaro] Why are you concerned about Berlusconi? 
  [Orlando] He is making what appears to me to be a decision 
dictated by desperation. He is too overexposed as a businessman 
and as a politician. One of the priority issues for us is 
holding a referendum on the Mammi-Berlusconi law. We must get 
rid of this absurd record. And besides, in any normal country, 
a businessman pays his debts to the banks. 
  [Cavallaro] Is it true you returned a greeting card sent to 
you by Father Sorge? 
  [Orlando] I had never done that with anybody before, but I 
found it absurd that he should offer to cooperate on precisely 
the day they sent [Father] Pintacuda an eviction order from 
Palermo. 
  [Cavallaro] Is it true you believe [Palermo Archbishop] 
Pappalardo to be too cautious? 
  [Orlando] In Palermo, the DC has collapsed, but not the 
church. Hitherto the cardinal has guaranteed pluralism. As a 
citizen and a Catholic, I hope he will continue to do so in the 
future.
