THE PREPS: HIGH SCHOOLS NEED TO SHOW MERCY ON WEAK 
In the aftermath of last Wednesday's controversial girls' basketball game 
between Inglewood Morningside and South Torrance, questions remain unanswered. 
Many fingers were pointed at Morningside Coach Frank Scott, who allowed Lisa 
Leslie, his All-American center, to score 101 points in a half. 
There was sympathy for South Torrance Coach Gil Ramirez, who removed his team 
from the game at halftime, trailing, 102-24, and for his team, which had begun 
the game with seven players but finished with four because two fouled out and 
one was injured. 
Many supported South Torrance's decision not to take the floor to begin the 
second half, preventing Leslie from breaking Cheryl Miller's eight-year-old 
national record of 105 points. 
When South Torrance school officials abided by Southern Section rules and 
suspended Ramirez from coaching the last game of the season, many people still 
said that Ramirez had done the right thing. 
It was difficult to find backers for Morningside, even though the Monarchs 
could probably win nearly every Ocean League game by a similar margin. But 
Morningside was, in a way, a victim of the unwritten code of high school 
athletics that says a superior team just cannot play its best against a weaker 
opponent. 
The Southern Section even changed its position last Friday morning when it 
reinstated Ramirez and allowed him to coach the Spartans' last game, saying 
that he had just cause to forfeit. 
With Ramirez on the bench, the inspired South Torrance team went on to lose to 
North Torrance by only 10 points, 60-50. Morningside, the defending state 
champion in Division I, went back to its normal ways, defeating Compton 
Centennial, 78-44. 
So, what was gained from last week's activities? Did the Morningside team learn 
a lesson in sportsmanship? Did the South Torrance team? No one can truly answer 
those questions. 
But if the Southern Section would like to see the situation not repeated, it 
should simply establish a mercy rule, as it has done in eight-man football, 
under which a team ahead by a certain margin is awarded the victory. 
In the Morningside-South Torrance game for example, with a 50-point mercy rule, 
the game would have been over early in the second quarter. No tears, no 
finger-pointing and no records broken. 
Having a mercy rule would be more logical than expecting a team not to play its 
best. In individual sports, such as track and field, it is not expected that a 
runner will slow down in every race against inferior opponents. Nor is that the 
case in tennis, swimming or wrestling. 
The City basketball playoffs will begin Friday with Manual Arts as the 
top-seeded team in the boys' 4-A Division. The Toilers, who lost to Crenshaw in 
the City final last season and again in the State Division I semifinals, won 
two close Western League games last week, beating Westchester and Fairfax. 
"We have paid our dues this season," Manual Arts Coach Randolph Simpson said. 
"We have played a tough schedule and we won our conference, but I don't 
necessary like us being the top seed." 
The Toilers, who won the state Division I title in 1988, are 21-3 this season 
and the Times' top-rated team in the City. However, in finishing conference 
play undefeated, they needed late heroics from senior forward William Celestine 
in both their 74-73 victory over Westchester and their 64-63 double-overtime 
victory over Fairfax. 
Simpson calls the 6-foot-5 Celestine, who is one of only three seniors on the 
team, the most underrated player in the City. Celestine is averaging 19 points 
and 12 rebounds a game. He is joined by the senior backcourt tandem of 6-2 
guard Marcell Capers, who is averaging 14 points and 11 assists a game, and 
Cedric Jones, a 5-7 three-point specialist. 
When asked to predict a final four for the City semifinals at the Sports Arena 
Feb. 23, Simpson said he expects Manual Arts to meet Dorsey, which routed 
Crenshaw last Friday, 91-67, and Crenshaw to play Fairfax. 
Quarterback Charles Levy of Lynwood, who was regarded as one of the top players 
in Southern California last season, said Monday that he will attend Arizona 
next season. 
The 6-2 Levy said that he chose Arizona over Colorado and Washington because 
the Wildcats had recruited him as a quarterback. 
Prep Notes 
Debbie Fischer of Huntington Beach Edison upped her own Southern Section 
records for three-point field goals for a career (100) and season (92) and tied 
her game record by making 10 of the long shots in the Chargers' 88-83 victory 
over Westminster last week. She had 49 points in the game. . . . According to 
Volleyball Monthly, UCLA is expected to sign three high school All-American 
girls Wednesday, the first official day of the letter-of-intent signing period, 
in Amy Boyer of Poway, Irene Renteria of Las Vegas Clark and Allison Randick of 
Moraga Campolindo.
