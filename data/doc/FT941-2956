FT  18 MAR 94 / Emergency insolvency legislation to go through Commons on
Monday
Emergency insolvency legislation to clarify the employment obligations of
companies in receivership and administration will go through the House of
Commons on Monday, the Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday.
The insolvency bill will go through the House of Lords on Tuesday and should
complete most of its parliamentary stages next week.
The bill, which is to be retrospective from last Tuesday, was announced
following concern after an appeal court ruling on Paramount Airways.
It will state that if there have been no new employment contracts agreed
after 14 days of the receivership or administration of a company, only
wages, salaries and pensions contributions will rank as secured creditors.
