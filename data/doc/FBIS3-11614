  [Text] Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen stated that his 
country is willing to go on without trade relations with the 
United States if Washington continues to condition its 
preferential status of bilateral trade on the domestic policies 
issues of the PRC. In an interview published today in the NEW 
YORK TIMES newspaper, Qian Qichen criticized the U.S. policy of 
setting the deadline of July 1994 on China's most favored nation 
status in trade with the United States if Beijing does not make 
progress in the observation of human rights. 
  It is important to remember that according to the very UN 
Human Rights Commission charter, the fulfilling of all its 
clauses are determined by the domestic and sovereign laws of 
each state.
