UAL Suspends Talks on Wide-Body Jets: The Chicago-based parent of United 
Airlines, in a newsletter to employees, said it has temporarily suspended 
negotiations for wide-body aircraft orders with airframe and engine 
manufacturers until Aug. 9. The development was viewed as a sign that the group 
seeking the airline is serious about partly financing the planned $4.4-billion 
buyout with the help of aircraft manufacturers or engine makers, arbitragers 
said. The internal newsletter said the board was acting on a request from 
United Employee Acquisition Corp., the employee-union group attempting a 
leveraged buyout of UAL.
