FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Fleming European Fledgeling down
Fleming European Fledgeling Investment Trust reported a 2 per cent fall in
net asset value per share to 74.4p at March 31 1992, against 76.1p a year
earlier.
Net revenue for the year dropped from Pounds 173,000 to Pounds 33,000,
giving earnings per share of 0.08p (0.48p).
As foreshadowed, no dividend will be paid due to the company moving to a
fully invested position and the low yields available on smaller European
companies.
The trust said it invested primarily for capital growth and any dividend
payments in normal circumstances were unlikely.
