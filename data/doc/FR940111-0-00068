I. Introduction 


A. Overview of the Original Rule 


The Commission promulgated the original Rule on September 24, 1982, making it fully effective on April 30, 1984.

 The Commission's decision to promulgate the Rule was appealed, and was subsequently affirmed in Harry  Bryant
Co. v.

 FTC.

 The Funeral Rule declares it an unfair or deceptive act or practice for funeral providers to: (1) fail to furnish price
information to funeral consumers; (2) require consumers to purchase items they do not desire to buy; and (3) embalm
deceased human remains for a fee without authorization. The Rule further declares it a deceptive practice for funeral
providers to misrepresent: (1) the necessity for embalming, caskets for cremation, and grave vaults or grave liners;
(2) legal and cemetery requirements; (3) preservation and protection capabilities of funeral goods and services;
and (4) cash advance charges for items arranged for by the funeral provider on the consumer's behalf.

obligations on funeral providers_became effective on April 30, 1984. Id. The effective date of 453.3(b)(1)(ii)

 726 F.2d 993 (4th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 820 (1984). The Court held that the Funeral Rule did not, as alleged,
exceed the Commission's authority under 5 and 18 of the FTC Act and did not violate funeral directors'
First Amendment rights of commercial free speech. 

</FOOTNOTE>


To prevent those practices and to correct consumers' misimpressions, the Rule contains several remedial requirements.
The Rule requires that funeral providers: (1) Disclose written price information by means of a General Price List
(``GPL''), Casket Price List (``CPL''), and an outer burial container price list (``OBCPL'') to persons who
inquire in person about funeral arrangements or the prices of funeral goods and services 
(453.2(b)(2)-(4));

 (2) Give purchasers a written statement, after they have selected funeral goods and services, containing the prices
for each of the items selected, the total price for the funeral arrangements selected, price estimates or actual costs,
if known, for cash advance items, and any legal, cemetery or crematory requirements that compel the purchase of any
items or services for the particular funeral (453.2(b)(5));

 The Rule permits providers to incorporate the information from the casket and outer burial container price lists
in the general price list. This combined list also must be offered to persons who inquire in person about funeral arrangements
or the prices of funeral goods and services.

(3) Affirmatively disclose to telephone callers who inquire about funeral ``terms, prices or conditions'' that
price information is available over the telephone (453.2(b)(1)(i));
(4) Disclose specific price information over the telephone to persons who call and request it (453.2(b)(1)(ii));
(5) Make truthful representations about legal and other requirements that compel the purchase of particular items
or services (453.3)); 
(6) Allow consumers to select and purchase only those goods and services they desire (rather than offering goods and
services only in predetermined packages) (453.4(b));
(7) Seek express approval before embalming the deceased for a fee (453.5)); 
(8) Make truthful representations about the preservative and protective value of funeral goods and services (453.3(e));

(9) Disclose that they charge a fee for obtaining cash advance items, if that is the case (453.3(f)); and
(10) Make unfinished wood boxes or alternative containers available for direct cremation, if the provider offers
direct cremation 
(453.4(a)(2)).
