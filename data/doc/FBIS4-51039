BFN 

  [Text] Washington, May 24 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Senator Max 
Baucus and three other members of Congress today urged President 
Clinton to stay away from trying to impose partial sanctions on 
China. 
  With the deadline approaching for the U.S. President to 
decide whether to extend unconditionally most-favored-nation 
(MFN) trade status for China, the four congressmen sent a letter 
to Clinton expressing their hope that he will "avoid a political 
compromise that is likely to prove unworkable, and instead make 
a clean break with the debate of the past and renew MFN 
completely." 
  The letter outlined their concerns over a so-called 
"targeted, half-way or partial sanctions" approach, which is 
reportedly under consideration by some administration officials. 
"We see very serious substantive problems with this idea and do 
not believe it should be undertaken without a full review of the 
proposal in the normal legislative process," they said. 
  Baucus, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on International 
Trade and an outspoken advocate of a policy of de-linking human 
rights and China's MFN, met with Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher this morning to press him on the points in the 
letter. 
  He has said repeatedly that if a partial sanctions bill were 
to be introduced, it could not pass the Senate. 
  President Clinton told reporters that he would announce his 
decision on China's MFN status within a week. "We still have not 
only ongoing negotiations with Congress, but with others as 
well," he said. "There are a number of things that still have to 
be resolved. We're working through it as quickly as we can."
