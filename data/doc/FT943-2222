FT  20 SEP 94 / Tiphook directors insist chief should stay
The directors of Central Transport Rental Group, formerly Tiphook, have
examined the details of chief executive Robert Montague's complex personal
finances, including an estimated Pounds 30m of debt, and are committed to
him staying with the troubled leasing company.
Following last Thursday's revelation, that the Royal Bank of Scotland's had
issued a bankruptcy petition against Mr Montague, (below), the Tiphook
founder has lain low, refusing to explain any difficulties concerning the
Pounds 2.3m bank loan.
The directors and newly-appointed chairman Ian Clubb, have analysed his
situation. Mr Clubb stated his continued commitment to Mr Montague.
It is not known what assets Mr Montague has linked to his debts. He owns a
13,000-acre estate in Oxfordshire, a London town-house, and a number of
private business interests.
Mr Montague comes from an affluent family, and news of his troubles shocked
Thursday's Annual General Meeting, which had focused on the large
remuneration paid to him.
Commerzbank and Barclays, which have the largest exposure to Mr Montague's
debts, have both remained silent about their intentions.
However, RBS, which has indicated that the move was a last ditch attempt to
resolve an 'an unacceptable situation', has yet to present the petition to
Mr Montague, and sources at Tiphook remain confident that he will remain
solvent.
Regardless of the outcome, the crisis will put greater strains on Tiphook's
struggle to survive with around Pounds 520m debt, and two loss-making
businesses.
