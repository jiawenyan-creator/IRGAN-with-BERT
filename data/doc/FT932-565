FT  28 JUN 93 / International Company News: C&amp;W chairman gets 77% rise to
Pounds 863,410
The salary of Lord Young, executive chairman of Cable and Wireless, the
telecommunications group, has risen from Pounds 487,375 to Pounds 863,410,
an increase of 77 per cent.
C&amp;W's annual report shows that the former cabinet minister received a
performance-related bonus of Pounds 409,828 for the year to March 31, during
which the group's pre-tax profits increased by 43 per cent, from Pounds 644m
to Pounds 918m under FRS 3.
The report said that the substantial bonuses paid to directors in the past
year reflected the group's considerable progress, not just only in 1992-93,
but also in previous years. There was a considerable long-term element to
the bonus scheme, and no bonuses had been paid in 1991-92.
