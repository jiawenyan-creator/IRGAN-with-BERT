  [Text] Helsinki -- North Korean leader Kim Il-song's second 
son Kim Pyong-il has been absent from his post as ambassador to 
Finland for two weeks, the daily HELSINGIN SANOMAT reported 
Thursday. 
  Confirmation was not available from the Helsinki Embassy. 
  The newspaper, Finland's biggest, said Kim Pyong-il left the 
country April 22 after serving as ambassador for about a month 
and the embassy had not announced when he would be back. 
  He handed his credentials to President Martti Ahtisaari [as 
received] late in March, the newspaper said, adding that experts 
considered the absence odd. "He left the country just a day or 
two before President Ahtisaari's dinner for the diplomatic 
corps. The once yearly dinners are occasions not to be absent 
from. They are seen as particularly important for new 
ambassadors," the paper wrote.
