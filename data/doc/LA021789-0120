The Southern Section ruled that the Oxnard Santa Clara High boys' basketball 
team will not be allowed to participate in regular-season tournaments next 
season and that the school's athletic department be put on probation until 
June, 1990, as a result of Santa Clara's pulling out of the Estancia tournament 
last Dec. 29-30. 
Santa Clara refused to return to the tournament for its final two games after 
Coach Lou Cvijanovich complained about the officiating in a 39-38 second-round 
loss to Huntington Beach Edison. 
Santa Clara must also pay financial restitution to Estancia for losses in gate 
and concession receipts, and must reimburse travel expenses to Laguna Hills and 
Huntington Beach, the teams that were scheduled to play Santa Clara in the 
forfeited games.
