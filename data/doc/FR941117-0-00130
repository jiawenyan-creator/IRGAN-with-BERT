(g) The FCC may waive specific distance separation requirements of paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section if the
applicant submits an engineering analysis which demonstrates that terrain effects and/or operation with less effective
radiated power would satisfy the applicable minimum desired to undesired signal strength ratios at the Grade B contours
of the protected TV stations. For this purpose, the Grade B contour of a TV station is deemed to be a circle with a 89 kilometer
(55 mile) radius, centered on the protected TV station location, and along which the median TV signal field strength
is 64 dB&mu;V/m. In any showing intended to demonstrate compliance with the minimum desired to undesired signal ratio
requirements of this section, all predicted field strengths must have been determined using the UHF TV propagation
curves contained in part 73 of this chapter.

Effective radiated power limits.



The purpose of the rules in this section, which limit effective radiated power (ERP), is to reduce the likelihood that
interference to television reception from public mobile operations on these channels will occur. The protected
TV station locations specified in this section are the locations of record as of September 1974, and these do not change
even though the TV stations may have been subsequently relocated.

(a) 

Maximum ERP. 

The ERP of base transmitters must not exceed 100 Watts under any circumstances. The ERP of mobile transmitters must
not exceed 60 Watts under any circumstances.

(b) 

Co-channel protection from base transmitters. 

The ERP of base transmitters in the New York-Northeastern New Jersey urban area must not exceed the limits in the tables
referenced in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section. The limits depend upon the height above average terrain
of the base transmitter antenna and the distance between the base transmitter and the nearest protected TV station
location in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(1) The protected TV station locations are as follows:
