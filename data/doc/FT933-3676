FT  13 SEP 93 / Samaras targets centrist and rightwing voters
IN a country where the leaders of both major political parties are in their
mid-70s, younger Greek politicians inevitably feel a sense of frustration,
writes Kerin Hope.
Mr Antonis Samaras, 42-year-old former foreign minister who brought down the
New Democracy government last week, is no exception.
Yet Mr Samaras, leader of Political Spring, a new party which hopes to
attract discontented centrist and rightwing voters in the October 10
election, may have got both his timing and his policies wrong.
One former cabinet minister said: 'All he had to do was be patient and the
New Democracy leadership would have dropped into his lap.'
As Greece's youngest foreign minister in memory, Mr Samaras was expected to
carry out instructions of Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, prime minister, and use
his charm to improve Greece's image with its European Community partners.
But Mr Samaras opposed the prime minister's policy of compromise over
recognising the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. He was sacked in
spring 1992 after proposing Greece close the border with Macedonia to
pressure it into changing its name.
The contradiction between Mr Samaras's efforts to present Political Spring
as the party that can rejuvenate Greek political life and his old-fashioned
nationalist views will not be lost on voters. Greek businessmen, anxious to
see the departure of the old political leaders wonder whether Mr Samaras, a
graduate of Harvard business school, can be serious about opposing the
government's privatisation policy.
Analysts expect Political Spring will win between up to six per cent of the
vote, enough to spoil Mr Mitsotakis's chances of returning to power.
Although Mr Samaras is likely to keep his parliamentary seat in Messenia in
southern Greece, he would be accused by conservatives of handing victory to
the socialists. As a result, his political future may be just as uncertain
as that of Mr Mitsotakis.
