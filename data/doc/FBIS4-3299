  [Text] Seoul, April 19 (XINHUA) -- South Korea and the 
United States stressed here today that the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea (DPRK) should act as soon as possible to allow 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to make additional 
nuclear inspection. 
  Addressing a working luncheon with U.S. Assistant Secretary 
of State Robert Gallucci, South Korean Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu said the immediate task is to get Pyongyang to agree to 
let the IAEA to further check its nuclear facilities, the YONHAP 
NEWS AGENCY reported. 
  Gallucci arrived here last Friday [22 April] to seek a joint 
strategy with South Korea in dealing with Pyongyang's nuclear 
issue. 
  Han and Gallucci stressed the importance of an inter-Korean 
dialogue in defusing the "nuclear crisis" and promised to work 
together for successful talks between South Korea and the DPRK. 
  The DPRK opposes the pressure put by the IAEA as well as the 
U.S. and other countries for further inspection of its nuclear 
sites, saying that it met the IAEA's demands in March this year. 
  IAEA Director-General Hans Blix is due to report to the 
United Nations Security Council on the DPRK's nuclear program in 
early May. 
  The DPRK has only a couple of weeks next month, said a South 
Korean official who asked not to be identified. "Pyongyang will 
either accept the IAEA team by then or face UN.Action," he 
claimed. 
  President of the UN Security Council Jean-Bernard Merimee 
issued a statement in New York on March 31, urging the DPRK to 
allow the IAEA to complete its inspection of Pyongyang's nuclear 
facilities. 
  "The council has decided to remain actively interested in 
the 
matter and further security council consideration will take 
place if necessary in order to achieve full implementation of 
the IAEA-DPRK safeguards agreement," the statement said.
