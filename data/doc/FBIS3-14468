  [Text] Cairo, 26 Mar (MENA)--Faruq Qaddumi, head of the 
PLO's Political Department, said in a speech at the opening 
session of the Arab League Council today that the Palestinians 
have come under intense pressure to resume the peace talks 
following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and before measures 
are available for protection of the Palestinian people. He 
called on the cosponsors of the peace process to shoulder their 
responsibilities in providing security for the Palestinian 
people. 
  He added that allowing the massacre to pass without 
punishment could undermine the peace efforts in the area. 
Referring to the racist tendencies in the Israeli Government 
itself, he said that the Israeli Government's actions are 
characterized by violence against the Palestinians, and that the 
massacre has exposed Israel's claim to be a democratic country. 
  Qaddumi affirmed that the PLO is committed to peace, but is 
not prepared to resume the peace talks under these conditions 
and until tangible measures are taken to protect the Palestinian 
people in the occupied territories. 
  He said that the massacre has singled out the problem of the 
settlements as a time bomb that does not help advance the peace 
process. 
  Qaddumi expressed regret at the recent U.S. position at the 
UN Security Council regarding the status of Jerusalem, saying it 
causes concern. He affirmed that the Palestinian people are 
ready to make sacrifices in order to ensure their legitimate 
rights, no matter how long this takes.
