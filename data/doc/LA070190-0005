EVERYBODY'S A CRITIC 
Having been a regular at L'Orangerie for some years now, I couldn't believe 
that it wasn't included amongst Los Angeles' finest. I was even more shocked 
when Reichl stated: "L'Orangerie offers a gorgeous setting, but the last meal I 
had there was so disappointing -- amateur service, high prices and food that 
was little more than bistro cooking." I have, to date, never had a bad meal or 
bad service at the restaurant.
