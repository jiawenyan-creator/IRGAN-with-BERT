MEDFLY SPRAYING 
Thank you for your excellent editorial "The Governor and the Medfly" (Feb. 22). 
However, as you suggest, it is probably too late for the governor to be able to 
allay any fears over aerial spraying. 
Moreover, it should not surprise our public officials if their words are met 
with incredulity. After all, they have been lying to us regularly for so many 
years that we scarely believe anything they say. And even I am capable of 
reading the health warnings on the malathion spray I use for my own plants. 
It will take more than one honest politician to set our country right. It will 
take nothing less than an American-style perestroika, one which will sweep 
every liar from office, to restore public confidence in our government. I can 
hardly wait.
