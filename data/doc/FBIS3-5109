  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- Japanese economic planning 
chief Manae Kubota said Friday that although times are tough the 
government hopes for a turnaround in the coming fiscal year. 
  But despite some recent bright spots in official reports, 
the 
director general of the Economic Planning Agency offered little 
change in her economic policy address to a full session of the 
House of Representatives, four days before her agency releases 
its monthly economic report. 
  In contrast to Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, who has 
maintained that interest rates are low enough to help spur 
recovery, Kubota hinted that further loosening of credit may 
become necessary. 
  "On monetary policy, I think appropriate and flexible 
management is needed, while closely watching domestic and 
international economic movements and international currency 
conditions," she said. 
  Kubota said the severity of employment conditions is 
apparent 
in the broadly sluggish economy, marked by slumping personal 
consumption and falling corporate capital spending. 
  She had cited modest labor market improvements in such 
sectors as construction but had said conditions have not 
recovered. 
  She again expressed hope that Japan will meet the agency's 
official government forecast of 2.4 percent growth in gross 
domestic product in the fiscal year starting next month after an 
expected 0.2 percent gain in the current fiscal year. 
  Kubota also pledged the government's efforts to enact 
promised tax reform this year that fairly balances taxes on 
income, consumption and assets to promote a vibrant society for 
Japan's graying population. 
  She repeated her prediction that Japan's current account 
surplus will decline next fiscal year but offered no specific 
trade measures.
