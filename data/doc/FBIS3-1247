  [Text] The National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] at De Brug 
outside Bloemfontein has completed its training and has begun 
evaluation prior to the deployment on the Witwatersrand. A 
spokesman for the force said the Commonwealth peacekeeping 
assistance group had begun an evaluation of the 3,000 troops in 
consultation with NPKF commanders. 
  The command staff had yet to decide where to deploy the 
1,000 
troops trained at Koeberg outside Cape Town. The spokesman said 
all plans for the peacekeeping force were on schedule and that 
the recruitment of more troops to the force was being considered.
