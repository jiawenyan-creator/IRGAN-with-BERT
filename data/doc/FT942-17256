FT  06 APR 94 / Job vacancies up 27% on quarter
Job vacancies are rising faster than official figures suggest, increasing 27
per cent in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, says Reed
Personnel Services, the employment agency group.
Reed says vacancies rose 15 per cent in January compared with January last
year, 35 per cent in February and 32 per cent in March.
Demand for office and secretarial staff began to rise earlier than demand
for professional staff such as accountants. But recently demand for
qualified accountants has risen steeply.
