EARNINGS 
Bankers Trust: The banking company lost $1.42 billion in the third quarter, 
contrasted with net income of $162.1 million in the 1988 quarter. The loss 
resulted from the New York-based firm's $1.63-billion provision for credit 
losses related to refinancing outstanding foreign loans. Without that, 
third-quarter income would have improved 11% to $180 million. The special 
provision aside, the results benefited from increased non-interest revenue and 
a lower effective tax rate although these factors were partially offset by 
increased noninterest expenses and the provision for credit losses other than 
the special provision.
