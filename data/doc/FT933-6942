FT  25 AUG 93 / World Trade News: US critics hit at Uruguay Round draft
THE DUNKEL negotiating text for completing the Uruguay Round of world trade
talks is coming under fire from both business and labour in the US.
Lobbyists are demanding far-reaching changes, and more progress on reducing
tariffs.
The text, prepared by Mr Arthur Dunkel, former director-general of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, proposes compromises based on Gatt
members' positions. In the view of many US companies, it is weighted against
'the world's most open large market' because it would cripple the trade laws
used to protect against 'unfair' practices or to open foreign markets.
Objectors believe the text places too much emphasis on curtailing US trade
laws. They argue greater attention should be paid to controlling dumping,
subsidies and industrial targeting - practices those laws are meant to
address.
The enthusiastic support of US business is vital if a final Uruguay Round
package of reforms - with a notional deadline for agreement of December 15 -
is to overcome protectionist forces in Congress.
The US Chamber of Commerce last week sent Mr John Schmidt, the country's
co-ordinator for multilateral trade negotiations, a document spelling out
what it sees as the draft's 'shortcomings'. High on the list was a complaint
that it 'benefited significantly' the interests of the targets of
anti-dumping investigations while prejucing those of complainants. An
updated report produced by the Labour/Industry Coalition for International
Trade has pinpointed many of the same deficiencies.
The Chamber of Commerce is also pressing for further tariff reductions (it
mentions textiles and electronics), harmonisation of tariffs, and 'vigorous
attempts' to achieve commitments made at this summer's Tokyo summit to cut
peak tariffs in half and other tariffs by at least 33 per cent.
