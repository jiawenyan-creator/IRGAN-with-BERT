FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: A&amp;P tumbles to Dollars 17m
GREAT Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, the US supermarket operator in which
Germany's Tengelmann group holds a majority stake, yesterday reported a 25
per cent drop in first-quarter earnings before special charges, writes
Martin Dickson.
The company, which has come under fire from the New York state employees'
pension fund for a lacklustre profits record, reported earnings of Dollars
17.05m, or 45 cents a share, compared with Dollars 22.8m, or 60 cents a
share, last year.
The 1992 figures were turned into a Dollars 157.4m loss by Dollars 180.2m of
unusual non-cash charges.
Sales in the quarter totalled Dollars 3.28bn, compared with Dollars 3.3bn,
and the 1993 figures were helped by more than 11 weeks of sales from more
than 40 Big Star stores, acquired in March.
