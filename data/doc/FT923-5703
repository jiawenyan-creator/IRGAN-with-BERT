FT  28 AUG 92 / West German engineering orders fall
NEW ORDERS for west German plant and engineering products slumped 16 per
cent in July, the VDMA industry association said.
Meanwhile, the inflation rate turned upwards again in August after a sharp
fall in July. The annual rate of consumer price increases rose to a
provisional 3.5 per cent, compared with 3.3 per cent in July, the federal
statistics bureau said. While still within the predicted range, and well
below March's high of 4.8 per cent, the figure will disappoint markets and
politicians alike.
The VDMA reckoned members' July export orders fell 17 per cent, and domestic
demand fell 14 per cent over the equivalent month last year. In the three
months to end-July, orders were down 11 per cent.
