PLEASANT VARIETY SCORES VICTORY 
Pleasant Variety, ridden by grass specialist Earlie Fires, staged a late rall 
on Arlington International Racecourse's turf course Saturday to win the 57th 
running of the $300,000 Arlington Handicap. 
Double Booked, a 21-1 shot who took the lead immediately and was in front until 
faltering in the final 1/16th mile, finished nearly three lengths back in 
second. Ten Keys, 13-10 favorite of the 17,040 fans, was third in the 1 1/4 
mile race. 
Pleasant Variety, who earned $180,000 for the victory, paid $12.20, $7.40 and 
$4 and was timed in 2:04.
