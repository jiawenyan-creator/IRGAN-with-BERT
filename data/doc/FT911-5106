FT  16 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt offers unusual
contrast
WITH THE EXCEPTION of an unusually positive Frankfurt, individual shares
featured yesterday as bourses put in a mixed performance. Zurich was closed
for the Spring Festival, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT broke up through the 1,600 resistance level on the DAX index
following last week's failed attempt. After a 7.82 rise to 680.28 in the FAZ
index at midsession, the DAX closed 18.28, or 1.2 per cent higher at
1,601.42, its best finish since the 1602.29 high for 1991 recorded on March
8.
Speculation that the US will soon cut interest rates took pressure off the
D-Mark. Buying of blue chips helped the index to rise and triggered buying
of other stocks as volume rose from DM4.9bn to DM6.0bn.
Among the international favourites, Deutsche Bank gained DM9.50 to DM648,
Daimler DM17.20 to DM684.20 and Siemens DM6.60 to DM603.60.
However, last week's winners fell by the wayside. In retailers, Karstadt
fell DM2 to DM613; in construction, Bilfinger &amp; Berger eased DM6 to DM884;
and in utilities, the relatively diminutive VEW dropped DM5 to DM224.
MILAN was dominated by last-minute technical adjustments before today's
close of the April trading account. The Comit index fell 2.66 to 591.54 in
volume estimated below Friday's L170bn.
Cir, the holding company of Mr Carlo De Benedetti, fell L55 or 2.1 per cent
to L2,615 on news that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, allied with members of the
Formenton and Mondadori families, had won board control of the Mondadori
publishing group. Dealers said it was likely that there would be a two-tier
settlement to the long-running battle. Mr De Benedetti would first sell his
stake in Mondadori to Mr Berlusconi and then get control of the newspaper La
Repubblica, the weekly magazine L'Espresso and the art and cultural
publications in return for a lump sum. They added, however, that the L300bn
figure rumoured in the market was unacceptable to Cir.
AMSTERDAM was strengthened by an early Wall Street rise and a strong showing
from Royal Dutch. The CBS tendency index ended 1.3 higher at 97.1. The oil
company rose Fl 4 to Fl 154.60, a high for the year, following its annual
presentation on Friday and on hopes that the dividend will be raised this
year.
Heineken gained Fl 3.40 to Fl 161.40 on hopes that the current warm weather
in the Netherlands heralds a hot summer. The brewer attributed its rise in
sales in both 1989 and 1990 to unseasonably warm summer weather.
Yesterday the bourse said it had scrapped the listing of the remaining
shares in the insurer Nationale-Nederlanden and NMB Postbank on Friday after
their merger in March.
BRUSSELS saw active trade in Delhaize on reports that an investor had built
up a 5 per cent stake. The retailer said it planned to renew an
anti-takeover 'poison pill' at an extraordinary shareholders meeting on May
3. The share rose as high as BFr8,390 before closing BFr190 lower at
BFr7,970 with 30,600 shares traded. The Bel-20 index rose 1.51 to 1,208.07.
PARIS started firm on interest rate hopes, but fell back to end with the
CAC-40 index up 0.92 at 1,822.35, off a high of 1,832.72, in volume down
from FFr2.7bn to FFr1.5bn.
Michelin climbed FFr1.50 to FFr90.20 with 263,350 shares traded on
speculative buying ahead of the 1990 results due on Wednesday. Alcatel
Alsthom, which announced a spate of contracts, rose FFr5 to FFr600. Suez
dropped FFr7 to FFr337.50 on expectations of a fall in profits at its unit
Societe Generale de Belgique. BSN, a recent underperformer, rose FFr11 to
FFr849.
MADRID swallowed early disappointment that the Bank of Spain had left its
benchmark intervention rate unchanged and was led higher by the utilities
and banking sectors. The general index added 1.90 to 282.99 in volume
estimated at Pta14bn after Friday's Pta17.5bn.
STOCKHOLM recovered from a weak opening to close marginally higher in quiet
trade. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 2.8 to 1,098.8 in turnover of
SKr235m after SKr287m.
VIENNA reached its highest level since last August. The bourse index rose
5.1 to 592.43.
