Final rule.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NASA is amending 14 CFR Part 1215, ``Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS),'' by revising Appendix A to
reflect the estimated service rates in 1995 dollars for TDRSS standard services, based on NASA escalation estimates.
14 CFR Part 1215 sets forth the policy governing the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) services provided
to non-U.S. Government users and the reimbursement for rendering such services. The TDRSS represents a major investment
by the U.S. Government with the primary goal of providing improved communications and tracking services to spacecraft
in low earth orbit or to mobile terrestrial users such as aircraft or balloons.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This regulation was first published in the 

Federal Register 

on March 9, 1983 (48 FR 9845). Each year since that time, 14 CFR Part 1215 has been amended by revising Appendix A to reflect
the rate changes for the appropriate calendar years (CY). Since this revision of Appendix A to 14 CFR Part 1215 reflects
the rate changes for CY 1995 and involves NASA management procedures and decisions, no public comment is required.



The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has determined that this rule is not subject to the requirements
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601612, since it will not exert a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities, and it is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291.
