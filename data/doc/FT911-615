FT  10 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: The block in BP's profits pipeline
FT-SE Index: 2,541.8 (+18.4)
For an FT-SE company handsomely to beat profit expectations is quite
something; the disappointment for the market is that it was BP. The oil
sector has scarcely been a model of earnings stability, after all. BP
managed to avoid booking a novel pre-tax historic cost loss in the first
quarter, but only just.
Had the Pounds 4m corporate charge been more typical and had chemicals not
benefited from a marked fall in feedstock prices, the picture would have
been more as expected. It would have been misleading just the same.
In fact, BP's underlying performance was impressive, thanks mainly to its
downstream operations. The boost from refining margins augurs extremely well
for Shell's results next week. The rest of the year will be much tougher -
margins have since narrowed to more normal levels. And the lower corporate
charge might not be repeatable.
The finance division may have produced a timely contribution from its
currency activities, but presumably this could just as easily have gone the
other way. By the same token, chemicals are not showing any signs of the
overdue cyclical recovery.
BP will be strongly cash negative until it can make some disposals, while
its recent discoveries will take a few years to produce a return. The
optimistic view is that it is simply borrowing to finance its expansion
through the decade.
This year's dividend might be uncovered or barely covered, but the shares
are on a hefty 34 per cent yield premium to the market, which seems ample
compensation for the risks. With the oil market still settling after the
Gulf war, though, cautious investors will prefer Shell or want to stay out
of oil shares altogether.
