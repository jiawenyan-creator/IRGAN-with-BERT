FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: MP warns over power station
MR Andrew MacKinlay, Labour MP for Thurrock in Essex, said last night he
believed staff at West Thurrock power station would be told today it was to
close with the loss of hundreds of jobs.
'If these rumours are untrue, National Power should reassure the workforce
immediately,' he said. 'But I fear they are true. The inevitable consequence
of privatisation of energy in this country is that jobs would be lost.'
National Power, which has already closed several power stations, would not
confirm or deny the reports last night but added that the company 'has said
it would address the problem of overcapacity'.
