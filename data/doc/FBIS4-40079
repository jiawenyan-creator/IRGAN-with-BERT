  [Text] Today it was announced that the congress of Russian 
writers opens tomorrow in Moscow and one of the events of the 
first day of work at the congress will be the ceremony to give 
an award to the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic. 
Karadzic has just arrived in Moscow. Here is a report from 
Vyacheslav Grunskiy. 
  [Grunskiy] The leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Karadzic, who 
planned to come to Moscow on 8 June was able to get to the 
Russian capital only this evening. The main reason for the 
delay was that this time Karadzic came to Moscow by private 
invitation, and therefore under the conditions of the 
international embargo currently in effect against Yugoslavia, it 
took a long time to reach an agreement with the UN 
sanctions-monitoring committee on a flight from Belgrade. 
  The Russian Union of Writers intended to award Karadzic a 
prize for his poems written, it is true, a long time before the 
start of the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. But nevertheless 
it is impossible to say that Karadzic's visit to Moscow is 
purely private. His delegation contains three ministers from the 
Bosnian Serb government. Karadzic himself intends during his 
visit to Moscow to meet several Russian leaders. 
  [Begin recording] [Grunskiy] Mr. Karadzic, Russian 
Independent Television. What questions do you intend to resolve 
during your visit to Moscow, and who are you going to meet? 
  [Karadzic in Russian] I hope to meet minister Kozyrev or 
maybe Churkin or meet someone from that ministry, the Foreign 
Ministry. I would like to have met Mr. Chernomyrdin. It seems 
that he is not in Russia at present. And also if it was 
possible to meet the president that would be a great joy for the 
Serbian delegation. [end recording] 
  [Grunskiy] How successful all these meetings will be we will 
discover tomorrow. Vyacheslav Grunskiy, Vladimir Ovdeyev, NTV, 
Sheremetyevo-1.
