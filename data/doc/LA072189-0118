THE STATE; 
2 GROUPS SEEK RECALL OF BONO 
Charging that Palm Springs Mayor Sonny Bono has reneged on campaign promises, 
members of two citizens' groups -- Save Palm Springs and Citizens of Palm 
Springs -- have joined forces to seek the recall of the 
celebrity-turned-politician. Critics charge that Bono, 54, who was elected in 
April, 1988, failed to take decisive steps to revitalize the city's struggling 
downtown and has been inaccessible to the public, despite his pledge to 
maintain an "open-door" policy. Dick Sroda, one of five people who signed an 
"intent-to-recall" letter mailed to Bono, also accused the mayor of using the 
office to promote his acting career. Bono was en route to Hawaii and 
unavailable for comment. Proponents of recalling Bono must gather 4,060 
signatures to qualify the measure.
