  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian carries in its "Novosti" newscast at 
1500 GMT on 10 February three reports from correspondents in 
Nizhniy Novgorod, Novosibirsk, and Omsk on how the communication 
workers' action is affecting radio and television broadcasting. 
  Aleksandr Tsirulnikov reports from Nizhniy Novgorod that the 
local communications workers have just ended blocking Ostankino 
radio and television programs. The Russian channel has been 
switched on, too. Television viewers in the town and oblast 
will therefore be able to watch the scheduled evening programs. 
Earlier, Ostankino Television's first channel carried nothing 
except the three "Novosti" bulletins. The second channel 
carried only two "Vesti" bulletins. The oblast's governor has 
promised the communication workers help in securing funding for 
maintenance work on broadcasting equipment. 
  Oleg Ryzhov reports from Novosibirsk that the main 
television 
channels have remained silent since the morning. 
  Vera Morozova reports from Omsk that television screens 
during the day were blank until the screening in the early 
evening of news bulletins on all three channels including the 
St. Petersburg channel.
