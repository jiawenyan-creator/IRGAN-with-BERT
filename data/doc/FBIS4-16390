  [Text] Moscow 14 April, TASS -- Ukrainian authorities have 
kicked eighteen naval officers of the Black Sea Fleet out of 
their flats. They were evicted with their families and all 
their belongings after they refused to swear allegiance to 
Ukraine, a source in the naval press centre told ITAR-TASS. 
  Ukrainian troops have already seized the unit's ships and 
hoisted the yellow-blue Ukrainian flags on their masts. 
  The Black Sea Fleet command is now taking measures to 
evacuate its officers and their families from Odessa. 
  [At 1700 GMT on 14 April Kiev Ukrainian Radio First Program 
Network in Ukrainian reports: "The head of the Ukrainian Navy 
press-center, captain third rank Mykola Savchenko has described 
as misinformation the ITAR-TASS report alleging that 18 officers 
and warrant officers in Odessa who had not sworn an oath of 
allegiance to Ukraine were evicted. (?Ordinary) servicemen are 
being misrepresented as (?sufferers) for the cause, stressed the 
head of the Ukrainian Navy press center."]
