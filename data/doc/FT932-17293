FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Ayrshire Metal
A cost cutting programme helped Ayrshire Metal Products return to profit
over the 1992 year.
Turnover declined slightly to Pounds 28.4m (29.9m). After reduced interest
charges of Pounds 126,000 (Pounds 227,000) and a Pounds 57,000 contribution
(Pounds 236,000 deficit) from the Leslie Steel Storage Systems associate,
pre-tax profits emerged at Pounds 209,000 compared with losses in 1991 of
Pounds 297,000.
Earnings per share were 2.1p against losses of 2.3p.
Nevertheless, Mr James Boyd, chairman, remained gloomy on prospects: 'There
are few signs of any material improvement in the principal areas of
business,' he said.
