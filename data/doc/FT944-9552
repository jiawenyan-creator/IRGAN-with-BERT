FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Renold jumps to Pounds 4.6m as orders
increase 20%
Pre-tax profits at Renold almost doubled in the six months to October 1,
when the chain and gear manufacturer experienced a 20 per cent rise in
orders.
The Manchester-based company yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds
4.6m (Pounds 2.4m) on turnover up 8 per cent to Pounds 70.9m (Pounds 65.4m),
despite lower sales in the machine tools and rotors division.
Operating margins improved from 5 to 7 per cent, after a lengthy
restructuring which has cut the workforce by 30 per cent to 2,600 in the
last four years.
Profits were also lifted by lower redundancy costs of Pounds 300,000 (Pounds
500,000) and a reduction in interest costs from Pounds 800,000 to Pounds
600,000.
Mr David Cotterill, chief executive, said: 'During the bad days, the company
invested a hell of a lot in the factories. That new equipment is producing
the goods now and generating a good cash stream.'
Profits improved at the chain operations, where the UK plants reported
higher sales in both domestic and export markets. Chains account for 60 per
cent of group turnover.
Demand recovered for the automotive timing chain produced in Calais, as US
motor manufacturers aim to replace belts with longer-lasting chains to drive
camshafts.
The gears division reported a 35 per cent increase in orders after
attracting contracts for escalators in underground transport systems,
including London's Jubilee line.
The machine tools division is expected to improve sales in the second half,
including orders from the air conditioning and food distribution industries
in Japan and Russia.
Mr Cotterill said the company would seek to acquire bolt-on businesses to
complement its present activities. It was also planning to lift capital
expenditure from its present Pounds 2.5m.
Gearing fell from 19 to 2 per cent at the half-year stage as net borrowings
decreased to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 10.1m).
Earnings per share rose to 5.5p (2.9p) and the interim dividend is lifted
from 0.7p to 1.2p.
The shares closed up 4 1/2 p to 178 1/2 p yesterday.
