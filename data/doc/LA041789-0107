DOWNEY DEFLATED -- TWICE 
While TV talk show host Morton Downey Jr. was conducting forums at the 
University of Rhode Island, someone let the air out of all four tires on his 
limousine, campus police said today. 
University President Edward D. Eddy, who stood in the back of the hall, said he 
found Downey "pathetic. Why anybody would pay $10 for this kind of thing I 
don't understand."
