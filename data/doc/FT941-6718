FT  01 MAR 94 / High cost of EU unemployment
The direct cost of unemployment within the European Union was Ecu210bn
(Pounds 159bn) last year, equivalent to the gross domestic product of
Belgium, according to Mr Padraig Flynn, the EU social affairs commissioner,
writes David Goodhart. Mr Flynn, speaking in London, said that while
increasing worker flexibility and reducing the cost of employment were
important aspects of job creation, simple deregulatory prescriptions could
be dangerous. 'In under-regulated labour markets you create poverty and
insecurity which is not a good basis for the development of human capital,'
he said.
