  [Text] Upward to the stars. This slogan is apparently 
becoming quite popular in Czech science laboratories. It is 
nice to think that our country contributed in many ways to make 
this slogan a reality for the Czech Republic and its people. 
Details from our correspondent in Prague. 
  [Begin recording] [Lyubovtsev] Bench trials of a future 
satellite are being carried out at the Czech Academy of Sciences 
laboratory. It is hard to imagine just how far it will fly from 
this small laboratory -- more than 200,000 kilometers into an 
orbit around the Earth. In tandem with another satellite -- and 
there will be two such pairs -- it will be part of the new 
international (Interbol) project designed to study the 
magnetosphere of our planet. The complicated internal workings 
of this piece of space apparatus have been prepared in the 
laboratories of 19 European countries. The main initiators of 
the project are Russia and the Czech Republic. Specialists from 
Poland, Germany, and France, together with our scientists are 
carrying out tests on the scientific instruments. It can be 
seen here that heavenly bodies are made by human hands and 
through the cooperation of entire collectives. Pavel Ceska, 
head of the project for the Czech side and chief coordinator of 
the work, is a world famous scientist. 
  [Ceska] This project is called (Interbol) and work on it has 
been going on since the early 1980's when planning and 
development of the project began. Our group from the Geophysics 
Institute was involved in the space research program right from 
the very beginning of the Interkosmos program, which began in 
1967-68. 
  [Lyubovtsev] In other words, Nathan Andreyevich, you have 
very extensive experience in cooperation. 
  [Eysman] Yes, it goes back to the 1960's. Our Czech 
colleagues have installed quite a number of instruments in 
practically all of the international cooperation programs in 
which the Geophysics Institute took part. Naturally enough, 
however, our Czech colleagues made progress and began to develop 
and launch their own satellites with the aid of our launch 
vehicles. 
  [Ceska] This project includes all the international 
research, and global research into conditions for the 
preservation of life on our planet. [end recording]
