FT  31 MAR 92 / Machine tool output lowest since 1984
PRODUCTION of machine tools in the UK fell 22 per cent last year to about
Pounds 730m - the lowest in real terms since 1984 - confirming the
difficulties caused by the recession.
The figure is the latest estimate from the Machine Tool Technologies
Association, and is based on data for the first three quarters of last year.
The association said a 16 per cent decline in exports last year, to Pounds
411.1m, was clearly 'a matter of concern', although it should be viewed
against the background of a 10.5 per cent fall in world exports of machine
tools.
For the first time last year, the European Community accounted for more than
half of all UK exports, with Germany dislodging the US as the largest single
market.
Imports fell by 13.7 per cent to Pounds 451.2m, with Germany and Japan
accounting for more than half the total.
Although the trade deficit increased slightly to Pounds 40m, there was a
small surplus on trade with other EC nations.
Combining production and trade figures, the UK market for machine tools is
estimated at Pounds 770m, down 21 per cent from Pounds 975m in 1990. For
technical reasons, the association warns, last year's figure probably
over-estimates the true level of demand.
The figures show that the UK has retained its position as the world's
seventh-largest producer of machine tools.
