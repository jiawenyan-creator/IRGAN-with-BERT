FT  25 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith accuses Major of preparing to
'turn on the sick'
LABOUR LEADER Mr John Smith yesterday accused the prime minister of
preparing to 'turn on the sick' in the government's search for savings in
public expenditure.
Renewing his attack on the ideas of severely reducing the exemptions from
prescription charges and of 'hotel charges' for some people in hospital, Mr
Smith told the MSF technical union's conference that the prime minister was
prepared to go even further than his predecessor.
'Even Mrs Thatcher realised that the National Health Service occupied a
special place in British society,' he said. 'But not Mr Major; he now seems
set to turn on the sick to pay for his mistakes.'
Mr Smith added that Tories were suggesting that only a small number of
people would have to pay more. But the changes would affect 'ordinary
families up and down the country'.
