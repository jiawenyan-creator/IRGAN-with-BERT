FARRELL'S VOTE ON SMOKING BAN IN RESTAURANTS 
With their vote against a smoking ban, members of the Los Angeles City Council 
place restaurateurs' wealth concerns above their constituents' health concerns 
(Part A, Oct. 17). If the restaurant owners said the only way they could make 
money was to use plates made from cheap uranium waste that would keep food warm 
without using expensive energy, or perhaps asbestos napkins that would last a 
long time and survive careless flambeau chefs, would the council still side 
with the owners? The risks are probably no worse than tobacco smoke. 
The argument that people will dine somewhere else might have had some 
legitimacy in Beverly Hills where it's hard to be more than two miles from the 
border, but that is not the case in Los Angeles. Our city should set the 
example which would allow smaller cities the freedom to follow suit.
