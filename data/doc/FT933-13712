FT  17 JUL 93 / International Company News: China Merchants lifts HK bank
stake
CHINA MERCHANTS, one of the largest Beijing-controlled conglomerates in Hong
Kong, yesterday said it would pay HKDollars 509m (USDollars 65.7m) to take
its interest in Hong Kong Chinese Bank to 50 per cent from its current 15
per cent holding.
Hong Kong Chinese Bank is the main asset of HKCB Bank Holding, a company
controlled by Lippo, an Indonesian-Chinese finance and property group listed
in Hong Kong which is controlled by the Riady family.
Prior to yesterday's deal HKCB owned 85 per cent of the bank. China
Resources and Lippo have had a longstanding business relationship. In
addition to its interest in the bank, China Resources owns 4.9 per cent of
Lippo and 1.3 per cent of HKCB.
The two are partners in Hong Kong Building and Loan Agency, a locally-listed
mortgage financier. In March, Lippo paid HKDollars 164m for a 67.6 per cent
interest in the company, and later sold a 10 per cent holding to China
Merchants.
A general offer and subsequent placing of stock - to enable Hong Kong
Building and Loan Agency to remain listed - has left Lippo owning 65 per
cent of the company.
