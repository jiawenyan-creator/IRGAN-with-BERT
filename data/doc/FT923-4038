FT  09 SEP 92 / EETPU rebuked over agreements: Controversy over electricians
MR GAVIN LAIRD, general secretary of the AEEU craft union, publicly rebuked
the EETPU electrical wing of his organisation as efforts intensified to
ensure the return of the electricians to the TUC.
Mr Laird told the TUC annual conference that he would do everything he could
to help the Ucatt construction union in its 'rightful complaints' about the
construction industry.
He was speaking after Mr George Brumwell, Ucatt's general secretary, told
delegates that the EETPU had struck a single-union deal with an employer at
a site where his union was already recognised.
Delegates are tomorrow likely to debate terms governing talks on the
possible re-affiliation of the EETPU to the TUC. It was expelled in 1988 for
failing to implement TUC disputes rulings. Talks on its re-affiliation
follow its merger with the AEU engineers.
Mr Laird's comments came as the TUC re-affirmed concern about single-union
agreements which are made before the workforce has been recruited or
consulted. The AEU and EETPU have been the most successful unions at winning
such agreements.
Mr Jack Carr, assistant general-secretary of the MSF general union,
proposing the resolution, deplored 'beauty contests' in which unions
competed against each other for deals by 'bidding down' the rights of
workers.
