FT  02 JUL 93 / West's Azeri oil deal faces indefinite delay
OIL company executives in the Azerbaijan capital, Baku, said last night that
they feared the multi-billion dollar deal to develop offshore oil reserves
in the Caspian Sea would be indefinitely delayed by the new Azeri
government.
The executives were told last night - at a meeting with Mr Resul Guliyev,
the deputy prime minister for the oil sector - that the government needed
'two-and-a-half months' to review contracts which had been ready for signing
by the companies and the deposed president, Mr Abulfaz Elchibey.
Mr Elchibey fled to his home village in the province of Nakhichevan, handing
over the government to the former first secretary of the Azeri Communist
party, Mr Gaidar Aliyev.
The contracts to develop three oilfields in the Caspian Sea, with estimated
deposits of about 4bn barrels, were said to be worth Dollars 9bn (Pounds
6bn) to Dollars 12bn and had been awarded to a group of companies including
BP, Staatoil, Amoco, Pennzoil and the Turkish Petroleum Company.
Mr Aliyev, the new head of state, was reported by local news agencies to
have said that the 'unified' option of developing the fields, agreed between
the previous government and the oil companies, could be scrapped in favour
of separate contracts.
However, senior oil executives who are closely monitoring the situation in
Baku still believe that any Azeri government will wish to sign a deal with
the companies in the near future.
The main fears of the oil companies, according to one executive on the spot,
is that the new regime will attempt to improve the price by inviting a wider
circle of companies to tender for new contracts.
Meanwhile, the new government has said that one of its main priorities now
is to organise a professional army, following large-scale reverses in the
war against the Armenians who dominate the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. It
has also promised to raise living standards.
