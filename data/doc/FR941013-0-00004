Airworthiness Directives; Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) Model 1125 Westwind Astra Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain IAI Model 1125 Westwind Astra airplanes,
that requires relocation of the ground cable in the slat power drive unit. This amendment is prompted by a report that
the drive system for the leading edge slat stopped in transit during flight on a Model 1125 Westwind Astra airplane.
This incident was caused by an improper ground connection for the electric motor of the slat drive system, which resulted
in arcing and an open electrical circuit. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent possible fuel vapor
fire due to electrical arcing in an area where fuel vapors might be present and the inability to move the slats during
flight due to an open electrical circuit.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Effective November 14, 1994. 


The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the
Federal Register as of November 14, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) Model 1125 Westwind Astra airplanes was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on May 5, 1994 (59 FR 23174). That action proposed to require relocation of the ground cable in the slat power drive unit.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
The FAA estimates that 52 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 3 work
hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will cost approximately $53 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $11,336, or $218 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has 
been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket
at the location provided under the caption
