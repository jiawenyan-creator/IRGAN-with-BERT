Pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials Importation Act of 1966 (Pub. L. 89651;
80 Stat. 897; 15 CFR 301), we invite comments on the question of whether instruments of equivalent scientific value,
for the purposes for which the instruments shown below are intended to be used, are being manufactured in the United
States.

Comments must comply with Subsections 301.5(a)(3) and (4) of the regulations and be filed within 20 days with the Statutory
Import Programs Staff, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230. Applications may be examined between
8:30 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. in Room 4211, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington,
D.C.



Docket Number: 

94009. 

Applicant: 

LSU and AM College, c/o IRM, 1419 CEBA Bldg., Baton Rouge, LA 70803. 

Instrument: 

Pavement Materials Testing Apparatus. 

Manufacturer: 

Industrial Process Controls Ltd., Australia. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used to study the behavior of soil, rock, industrial by-products and recycled construction
materials under repeated loading. In addition, the instrument will be used in post graduate level civil engineering
courses in the Transportation Program to educate a new generation of transportation professionals to design, build
and maintain vital facilities into the 21st century. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

March 24, 1994.



Docket Number: 

94037. 

Applicant: 

University of Delaware, College of Marine Studies, Robinson Hall, Room 114, Newark, DE 19716. 

Instrument: 

Used Mass Spectrometer, Model VG Prism Series II. 

Manufacturer: 

VG Isogas/Fisons Instruments, United Kingdom. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used extensively for the analysis of the stable oxygen and carbon isotopic composition (

18

O/

16

O and 

13

C/

12

C, respectively) of biogenic carbonates such as clam and scallop shells, foraminifera, and ostracodes to obtain
data which will allow detailed interpretations of environmental conditions (temperature, salinity, carbon cycling)
in the geologic past. Other uses include research on the physiological response of plants to water stress (i.e. drought
conditions) and controlled experiments in a growth chamber fitted with a gas-permeable membrane to quantify the
response of marine phytoplankton to variable nutrient and light conditions. In addition the instrument will be used
for educational purposes in the course Stable Isotope Geochemistry (MAST 667). 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

March 29, 1994.



Docket Number: 

94039. 

Applicant: 

VA Medical Center (Atlanta), 1670 Clairmont Road, Decatur, GA 30033. 

Instrument: 

Electron Microscope, Model JEM 1210. 

Manufacturer: 

JEOL Ltd., Japan. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used to generate and support research projects underway in the Research Service of the medical
center. A variety of specimens including animal tissue samples, cell cultures and other materials will be studied.
In addition, the instrument will be important in the training of medical and graduate students, resident physicians
and fellows and staff. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

March 24, 1994.



Docket Number: 

94040. 

Applicant: 

University of Wisconsin-Madison, Integrated Microscopy Resource, 1525 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706. 

Instrument: 

Laser System. 

Manufacturer: 

Microlase Optical Systems Ltd., United Kingdom. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used as a fluorescence excitation source for the study of the dynamics of the internal cellular
architecture of living biological specimens in order to understand how the internal machinery of a cell functions
during development. In addition, the instrument will be used in courses on advanced microscopy techniques for undergraduates,
graduate students and visiting academic research workers. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

March 25, 1994.



Docket Number: 

94041. 

Applicant: 

The University of Michigan, 1150 W. Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0626. 

Instrument: 

Rapid Kinetic Spectrofluorimeter, Model SX.17MV. 

Manufacturer: 

Applied Photophysics Ltd., United Kingdom. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used for fluorescence studies of biological molecules present at low concentrations (nM).
Experiments will be conducted to identify the mechanism of nucleotide binding to and activation of G proteins. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

March 28, 1994.



Docket Number: 

94042. 

Applicant: 

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research  Development, P.O. Box 93478, Las Vegas, NV 89193-3478.


Instrument: 

ICP Mass Spectrometer, Model VG PlasmaQuad. 

Manufacturer: 

Fisons Instruments, United Kingdom. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used for studies of synthetic and natural environmental samples (water, soils, plant materials,
etc.). The materials, or extracts of the materials, will be injected into a liquid chromatograph that will be interfaced
with the instrument. The extremely high sensitivity of the instrument should allow the detection of very small concentrations
of individual chemical forms of trace metals. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

March 31, 1994.
