JURY'S NOT GUILTY VERDICT IN MCMARTIN PRE-SCHOOL CASE 
Let us hope that the most important lesson to be learned from the McMartin 
trial is taken to heart: The legal system relies far too much on the supposed 
"expertise" of mental health "professionals." 
Psychology is about as scientific as voodoo, and those who practice it have a 
vested interest in identifying a psychological problem where none is present, 
as only by doing this is their existence justified. 
It is good that the jury saw that the children's testimony was the product of 
suggestion, not reality. Unfortunately, not all juries or judges are so wise.
