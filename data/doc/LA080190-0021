TOUGHER ODDS IN LOTTO GAME 
I had to smirk upon reading the article "Lawmakers Say Tougher Odds in Lotto 
Game Make It a Loser" (Part A, July 19). Now, there's a news bulletin! 
Now, the ivory-towered bureaucrats have come up with a new and improved way to 
widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots. Well, of course they would 
think that larger jackpots are better; they would play the lottery out of a 
sense of fun, not out of a sense of desperate, last-ditch hope. 
In the real world, the people who can least afford to buy lottery tickets, 
those classified as "poor," are the ones most likely to buy them. The lottery 
is now taking their money, but giving them much less hope in return. Who really 
needs $30 million; but can you imagine what $1 million or $2 million could do 
for a family that is just squeaking by on $18,000 or less each year? What would 
they do? Most likely, quit renting and buy a house, buy a car, invest for their 
children's education, and maybe go back to school themselves. They would buy 
things that most of us take for granted, such as new clothing and new 
furniture. Now, look at all the money that has just returned to the economy. 
But, instead of helping 20 to 30 families attain lives that most of us consider 
normal, they've decided it's good PR to give the whole aforementioned $30 
million to one mega-winner, and while I don't begrudge that winner the money, I 
think it's sad that the Lottery Commission can't see how very much good they 
could have done by taking away one or more numbers from the former 49-number 
field, instead of adding to it.
