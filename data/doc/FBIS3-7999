  [Text] At last night's festivity held in a secretariat in 
Washington, after several days of negotiations, two preliminary 
agreements were signed. One concerns the joint federal state of 
Muslims and Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina and another the 
confederation of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Croatia. The 
agreements were signed by Dr. Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of 
Bosnia- Herzegovina, Kresimir Zubak, representative of the 
Croats of Bosnia- Herzegovina, and Dr. Mate Granic, minister of 
foreign affairs of the Republic of Croatia. 
  The agreement on the joint state of Muslims and Croats 
envisages the creation of a federal state with a strong central 
authority but also with a high degree of autonomy for the 
federal units. It is envisaged that in the federation, the 
central authorities would be in charge of defense of the 
country, economy, foreign politics, finances, and trade. The 
federal units would be of decisive influence in the organization 
of police, schooling, health services, and other spheres. 
  The preliminary agreement on creating a confederation of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia 
envisages looser relations between the two states, something 
that could be furthered later. Details of these agreements will 
be worked on in detail by transitory councils that will begin 
working in Vienna at the end of this week. The agreements 
should be ratified by the two countries' assemblies.
