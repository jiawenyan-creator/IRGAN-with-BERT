REAGAN PLANS TRIP TO BERLIN 
Former President Ronald Reagan, inspired by the tearing down of the Berlin Wall 
and talks on reunification of East and West Germany, will make a trip to Berlin 
in coming months, his aide said. 
"He has followed the events with great interest and he hopes to visit Berlin 
soon," spokesman Mark Weinberg said Thursday. No date was set. 
Weinberg said Reagan wasn't making the trip on behalf of any particular party 
or candidate in coming elections.
