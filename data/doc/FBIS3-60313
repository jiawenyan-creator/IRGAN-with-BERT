  [Text] Ukraine has no money to install the automatic 
radioactive atmospheric pollution monitoring station that was a 
gift to the nuclear power station in Rovne from President Lech 
Walesa. 
  [Correspondent Olga Iwaniak] The station was to have served 
the permanent monitoring of pollution arising from the work of 
this power station, which is situated something over 100 kms 
from the border with Poland. Meanwhile, the equipment, which is 
worth $10,000, is standing idle in the power station warehouse 
since the power station has got drastically poorer in recent 
times, has no money for indispensible maintenance and wage 
payments for employees, and so still less for the construction 
of cement foundations on which the station could be planted. 
The management fears that construction of the station without 
the appropriate security measures at a distance of four kms from 
the power station, even under guard, will be an attraction for 
thieves and that the equipment will dissapear overnight, within 
a day. 
  There are five great nuclear power stations in Ukraine, up 
to 
800 kms from our border, every one of which is going through 
similar financial difficulties. Their state of security is 
unsatisfactory, their personnel are demoralized by low wages. 
There are ever more frequent thefts from the fissile materials 
stores. Despite these threats, the exploitation of nuclear 
energy is a necessity for Ukraine -- it provides around 40 
percent of the electric energy indispensible for the functioning 
of the state -- whereas it will be necessary to pay in dollars 
for energy sources imported from Russia from January.
