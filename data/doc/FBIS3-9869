  [Text] In the view of Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik, 
the number-one priority in Czech-Slovak relations is to preserve 
integration and cooperation at least at its current level. At a 
meeting with journalists today, he said that the preservation of 
the customs union was important, mainly in view of the expected 
integration into the European Union. The prime minister also 
called for a solution to yet-unresolved problems. At the same 
time, however, he expressed doubts as to whether this could be 
achieved during the six months of his government's term of 
office. 
  Moravcik said it would be a great success if the division of 
assets of the former Federation was finally resolved. He would 
also like to improve Slovak-Hungarian relations, which were 
considerably tense during Meciar's rule, before the Paris 
conference (?of the Pact) on stability in Europe.
