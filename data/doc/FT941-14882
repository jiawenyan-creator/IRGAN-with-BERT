FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Colorvision in red as market share suffers
Colorvision, the Liverpool-based television and video retailer, fell into
losses of Pounds 1.26m pre-tax in the 26 weeks to September 30, against
profits of Pounds 153,000.
Mr Neville Michaelson, chairman, said that following his warning that there
had been no improvement in sales in the first quarter, trading deteriorated
in the next three months, traditionally the quietest time of the year.
He added that market share had fallen in core markets. He blamed
inconsistent marketing campaigns, concentration of senior management on
superstore development and over-emphasis on cost savings in operational
management.
The shares lost 17p yesterday to close at 98p.
However, Mr Michaelson added that remedial action had been taken and with
third quarter sales 7.4 per cent ahead of the comparable period, market
share and gross margins recovered.
During December the company opened a second superstore in Liverpool. And Mr
Michaelson said that since he had last reported two more high street stores
had opened but two store concessions had closed.
That took the number of outlets, including the superstores, to 90.
Turnover for the first half was Pounds 26m (Pounds 26.7m). Losses per share
came out at 4p (0.5p earnings).
However, in view of the improved second half trading the interim dividend is
held at 2.5p and the board expects to be able to maintain the total for the
year at 5.6p.
