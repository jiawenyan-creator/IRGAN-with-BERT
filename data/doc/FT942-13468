FT  25 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: More than one measure of executive
performance
Sir, Your article, 'Avoid the BP trap' (April 15), describes the difficulty
boards are experiencing in choosing a set of performance criteria on which
to base executive incentives.
But why the assumption that the performance of your directors can or should
be reduced to a single financial measure, such as earnings or share price,
measured over an arbitrary time period such as 12 months? As the recent
report of the RSA Tomorrow's Company Inquiry explained, business success is
likely to be a complex blend of success in relationships with customers,
employees, suppliers, investors and the community. Good work in each of
those areas finds its way through to earnings or the share price over
different timescales.
The real problem which boards face in determining executive remuneration is
how to devise a measurement system that stays simple, but does justice to
the true sources of sustainable company success. What boards measure and why
is one of the issues which the Tomorrow's Company Inquiry team is tackling
in the case studies which form the next stage in our investigation.
