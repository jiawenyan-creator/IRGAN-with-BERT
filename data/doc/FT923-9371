FT  05 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Change of control at Malaya Group
Mr Nicholas Lancaster, who built up the Lancaster group of motor dealerships
with his father, is to join the Malaya Group of Mercedes-Benz dealers as
managing director.
Malaya is to come under the control of Lancaster Associates Holdings in
proposals announced for the injection of Pounds 3m net new capital, and new
management expertise, and the simplification of the capital structure.
The Giltrap Group recently acquired voting control of Malaya through the
purchase of preference shares.
Mr Colin Giltrap proposed to increase his management role which, it was
hoped, would lead to a revival of the group's fortunes. In the event, he has
decided on the need for more funding and new management initiatives.
The preference shares are being converted into ordinary. There will be a
2-for-1 rights issue of 17.1m ordinary shares at 10p and the Lancaster
Associates will subscribe for 15m shares at 10p.
Giltrap has renounced its 7m rights shares in favour of Lancaster
Associates, which is underwriting the issue. Giltrap will finish with some
20.6 per cent of the enlarged capital while Lancaster Associates will hold
between 54 per cent and 69 per cent, depending on the underwriting needs.
