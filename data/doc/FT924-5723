FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Apollo Metals shows 38% drop to Pounds
1.26m
APOLLO METALS, the Birmingham-based aluminium distribution and processing
group, is maintaining its dividend in spite of a 38 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits in the year to September 30.
On turnover down from a restated Pounds 27m to Pounds 23.4m, profits
declined to Pounds 1.26m (Pounds 2.03m).
The figures, broadly in line with City expectations, translated into
fully-diluted earnings per share of 6p, against 10.3p. The proposed final
dividend of 2.3p maintains the total at 3.45p.
Over the past year Apollo has been hurt by recession in the UK (although the
market appears to have stopped declining in the second half), the general
downturn in aero-space industry demand and the impact of lower metal prices,
largely caused by the stream of aluminium sales from Russia.
On the domestic market the group sought with some success to maintain
margins by offering leading customers such as British Aerospace and Land
Rover a 'just-in-time' service and progress-ively to provide materials
management rather than mere stock delivery. This has involved more metal
pro-cessing.
But, at the same time, it has been expanding into France and Germany, the
costs of which clipped Pounds 200,000 from the pre-tax line.
This expansion added an extra workload to the Birmingham operations, raising
costs through the introduction of two-shift working and demanding
accumulation of extra inventory.
The effect was also to raise gearing from 7 per cent to 19 per cent.
However, the French and German operations are expected to trade profitably
this year and, through the expansion of their opera-tions, take some of the
financial strain off the UK. This would suggest a profits increase in
1992-93 provided the UK market does not decline.
Mr Bob Teare, chairman, is retiring and will be succeeded by Mr Albert
Hargreaves, the deputy chairman.
