FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: MG Corp damage limited by metals
group
Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals and engineering group, said
yesterday that it was having more success than it had anticipated in
limiting the damage caused by the speculative deals entered into by MG Corp,
the company's New York-based commodity trading subsidiary.
Metallgesellschaft said the losses from MG Corp's ventures in the US oils
derivatives markets had stabilised at the levels indicated earlier this
month.
MG Corp's risky ventures in the oil futures markets account for the bulk of
the DM3.3bn (Dollars 1.9bn) of past and potential losses which drove the
metals, mining and industrial conglomerate to the brink of bankruptcy. MG
Corp caused a loss of DM800m in the year to last September and is set to
lose a further DM1.5bn this financial year as it unwinds its positions.
The losses, believed to be the biggest suffered by a company as a result of
derivatives trading, arose because of a timing mismatch between MG Corp's
commitment to supply oil to customers in the future and the hedging
strategies used to protect the forward position.
While MG Corp contracted to deliver 170m barrels of oil at up to five years
into the future, it had attempted to cover its position by buying short-term
futures contracts. 'The timing difference killed them when the oil price
fell,' said one banker.
When the oil price fell MG Corp was obliged to meet margin calls - large
cash payouts - with the New York Mercantile Exchange in respect of its
short-term contracts. But it is understood that MG Corp did not require its
own customers to make margin calls, thereby exacerbating its cash flow
crisis.
Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chief executive of Metallgesellschaft, is formulating a
strategy for the group's future. Full details are to be revealed on February
22.
