FT  28 MAY 94 / South Korea sees 7% growth rate
South Korean economic growth will exceed 7 per cent this year with gross
national product having risen by 8.8 per cent in the first quarter, the
central bank reported yesterday, writes John Burton in Seoul.
The economic recovery after two sluggish years is being led by industrial
investments, which increased by 20.2 per cent in the wake of export growth
on the back of the weak Korean won.
