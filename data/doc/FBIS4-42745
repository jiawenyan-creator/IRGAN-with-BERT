  [Text] Twenty-two people were arrested by police guarding 
military trucks which protesters claim are used to move nuclear 
missile warheads around Britain on public roads. 
  The arrests were made last night at Balloch, Strathclyde, 
near the Royal Navy base on the Clyde where Polaris and Trident 
nuclear submarines are sited. 
  The Scottish skirmish was the latest in a series of clashes 
between the convoys, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and 
other peace protesters. 
  Trucks with police motorcycle outriders were briefly halted 
earlier today by protesters at Albermarle, near Newcastle upon 
Tyne, and then Stirling in Scotland. 
  Anti-nuclear campaigners claimed the convoy was one of those 
which regularly took warheads between Burghfield, Berks, and the 
Clyde submarine base. 
  Pat Freeborn said it was impeded near Balloch when 
demonstrators chained themselves to vehicles and daubed them 
with paint in protest at warheads being carried on public roads. 
  "If they are going to have such dangerous weapons, there 
must 
be another method of moving them," he said. "They are going to 
end up blowing up the very people they are supposed to be 
protecting." 
  The Ministry of Defence said there were "incidents" today 
involving a military convoy, but described them as minor and 
would not confirm the presence of nuclear warhead carriers. 
  Police said 15 men and seven women were arrested over an 
alleged breach of the peace but could not say if they would 
appear in court.
