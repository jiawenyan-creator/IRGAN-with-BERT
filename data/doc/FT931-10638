FT  08 FEB 93 / International Company News: Roussel-Uclaf bucks trend with
surge in earnings of 72%
ROUSSEL-Uclaf, one of France's largest chemicals companies, has bucked the
slump in the French corporate sector by increasing net profits by 72 per
cent to FFr1.02bn (Dollars 182m) in 1992.
The group, which is 54 per cent owned by Hoechst, the German chemicals
group, said that most areas of activity had shown growth in 1992 with some
sectors performing ahead of target. The only exception was arable farming
products which suffered from the economic slowdown in Europe and the
European community's agricultural reforms.
Roussel's overall sales rose by 3.2 per cent to FFr14.8bn. Net profits,
excluding exceptional items, showed growth of 11.9 per cent to FFr735m last
year. The group's underlying performance benefited from the strengthening of
the US dollar.
Roussel, chaired by Dr Edouard Sakziz, is in the throes of a large-scale
rationalisation programme across its European operations. This
reorganisation, which will continue until 1995 and has been highly
controversial in France, involves the closure of eight out of Roussel's 10
European factories and the loss of 800 jobs.
Last year the rationalisation cost the company FFr370m.
