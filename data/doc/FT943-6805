FT  26 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Piper Jaffray-run funds may
have lost Dollars 700m
A group of investment funds and private investor accounts run by a money
manager at Minneapolis-based brokerage Piper Jaffray may have lost as much
as Dollars 700m this year because of derivatives-related losses, the firm
has admitted.
The losses are said to have been incurred primarily on mortgage-backed
securities which the manager, Mr Worth Bruntjen, had bought for a group of
bond funds and privately managed accounts. The value of the assets managed
by Mr Bruntjen stood at Dollars 3.5bn at the end of 1993, but by the end of
June this year the value had plunged to Dollars 2.79bn. Piper Jaffray has
said that the decline was almost entirely due to market losses, rather than
withdrawals by investors.
Although Piper Jaffray has made a Dollars 10m investment in one of the
affected funds as a display of confidence, the firm is under pressure to
provide further financial support to the funds and accounts managed by Mr
Bruntjen. It also faces legal action over the losses.
The problems at the Piper Jaffray-managed funds and accounts are just the
latest example of how professional investment managers and corporations in
the US have been hit hard this year because their derivatives holdings have
exaggerated the negative impact on securities prices of sharply rising
interest rates.
Among those plagued by derivatives-related losses recently have been the
Wall Street securities firm PaineWebber, BankAmerica, and the consumer
products group Procter &amp; Gamble.
