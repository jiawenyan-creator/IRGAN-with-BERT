U.S. RESPONSE TO MIDEAST TERRORISM 
We are all outraged and frustrated over the latest barbaric act committed by an 
Iranian-controlled fundamentalist terrorist group in Lebanon. 
The apparent tragic, brutal execution of Higgins and the obscene threats to 
murder additional innocent Western hostages once again underscore the real 
obstacles to progress and peace in the Middle East. 
As Americans we are affected only occasionally by acts of barbarism and 
terrorism; the people of Israel live in the very midst of a culture of violence 
and war and endure it on a daily basis. 
As a nation that is regularly subjected to acts of terrorism, Israel has the 
right to defend itself. It would be a great injustice indeed if, in our 
frustration over our current inability to deal directly with the barbaric 
behavior of the Hezbollah, we were to strike out at our closest ally or remain 
silent while certain of our leaders unjustly criticize its actions.
