FT  19 MAR 93 / Tannery appeals Pounds 1.1m damages
A CAMBRIDGESHIRE tannery yesterday won the right to appeal one of the
biggest ever UK environmental damages awards in the House of Lords. Last
November three court of appeal judges awarded Pounds 1.1m against Eastern
Counties Leatherwork, to Cambridge Water Company in compensation for
contaminating a water aquifer.
The case is expected to come before the Lords within one or two years.
