BOARD RECOMMENDS FREEDOM FOR AWARD-WINNING PRISON JOURNALIST 
The Louisiana Pardon Board on Wednesday recommended that Wilbert Rideau, a 
convicted murderer who became an award-winning journalist behind bars, be set 
free after 29 years in prison. 
The final decision will be made by Gov. Buddy Roemer, who has cited the 
viciousness of Rideau's crimes in refusing to commute his life sentence in the 
past. 
After Wednesday's decision, Roemer said he had no plans to do so now. 
"It's difficult, I wish I had an easy answer. But my inclination is not to 
accept their recommendation," the governor said. 
The five-member board voted unanimously to reduce the 48-year-old prison 
magazine editor's sentence to 55 years, which defense attorney Julian Murray 
said would qualify him for immediate release. 
"This is the same recommendation this board made in 1988," said board 
chairwoman Yvonne Campbell. "It was based on his prison record, his 
accomplishments, and he has only had one write-up in his 29 years in prison." 
Two board members also recommended that Rideau be required to leave the state 
permanently, contribute part of the earnings from his writing to a victims' 
reparation fund and be ordered to perform some community service. 
Rideau was sentenced to death for the 1961 murder of a bank teller in an armed 
robbery. His sentence was commuted to life in 1973 when the U.S. Supreme Court 
overturned the death penalty. 
Some argued against clemency. 
Rick Bryant, an assistant prosecutor in Calcasieu Parish, called the 
premeditated robbery and murder one of the most heinous ever in the parish. 
"I've spoken with people who are still terrified of Wilbert Rideau," Bryant 
said. "We do believe Mr. Rideau has received his clemency. He's not dead."
