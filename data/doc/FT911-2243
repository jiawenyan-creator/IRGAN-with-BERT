FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: BBV advances 6% to Pta32bn
BANCO BILBAO Vizcaya (BBV), Spain's largest retail bank, yesterday reported
a 26 per cent rise in first-quarter cash-flow to Pta70.3bn (Dollars 645m).
Pre-tax profits advanced 6 per cent to Pta31.8bn.
BBV's operating profits of Pta83.9bn were nearly 5 per cent below the
Pta88.4bn reported in the first quarter of last year. However it was 3.4 per
cent up on the Pta83.9bn posted in the final three months of last year.
The bank endured a marked narrowing of its margins in 1990 when it launched
costly financial products during a fierce battle for market share among
Spain's retail banks.
BBV said the latest quarterly result, which still bore the burden of the
1990 marketing effort, would be the most unfavourable of those to be
reported this year.
In contrast to BBV, Banco Popular, the Spanish bank 43 per cent-owned by
foreign investors, reported after-tax profits for the quarter of Pta11.6bn,
14.6 per cent up on the same period last year.
The results, which extend the strong performance shown by the bank in recent
years, represent an operating margin of 6.6 per cent, against the 6.47 per
cent for 1990.
A third Spanish bank, Banco Hispano Americano, posted a 0.3 per cent rise in
margins, to Pta23.2bn, and pre-tax profits of Pta13.2bn, an 11.3 per cent
increase on the first quarter of 1990.
