FT  01 DEC 93 / Major defends contacts with Sinn Fein
Mr John Major underlined the government's determination to keep lines of
communication with Sinn Fein open as he made a vigorous Commons defence
yesterday of this year's extensive contacts with Provisional leaders.
Speaking less than 24 hours after the release of papers suggesting that the
IRA had been on the verge of ending its campaign of violence, the prime
minister told MPs it would be useful to continue to have a confidential
channel of communication.
But the air of optimism stemming from the supportive response of most MPs to
this week's revelations was tempered by continuing doubt over the date of
this month's Dublin summit and by renewed violence in Belfast.
A Roman Catholic man was shot dead by members of the outlawed paramilitary
Ulster Volunteer Force as he prepared to drive home from the factory where
he worked in loyalist east Belfast.
The shooting added weight to a warning by Lord Tebbit, the former
Conservative party chairman, that attempts to reach an understanding with
the IRA risked provoking an escalation of violence from loyalist
paramilitaries.
The summit between Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart,
could still take place this Friday. Downing Street said the two sides were
continuing to 'prepare the ground'.
The two leaders had spoken by telephone on Monday evening, it said.
Continuing differences over the drafting of a joint communique were
underlined last night by Dublin, which said there was 'no question' of it
participating in a 'fudge'. Intense contacts between the offices of the two
leaders continued last night but Downing Street was unwilling to say whether
the summit would go ahead on December 3.
