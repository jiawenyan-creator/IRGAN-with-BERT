 

(b)(1) The electronic evaporative and/or refueling emission purge control, if equipped, and all emission-related
powertrain components connected to a computer shall, at a minimum, be monitored for circuit continuity. All components
required by these regulations to be monitored shall be evaluated periodically, but no less frequently than once per
Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule as defined in 40 CFR part 86, appendix I, paragraph (a), or similar trip. 

(b)(2) through (j) [Reserved]. For guidance see 86.09417. 

22. A new 86.09821 is added to subpart A to read as follows: 



86.09821 

Application for certification. 



Section 86.09821 includes text that specifies requirements that differ from 86.09421 or 86.09621.
Where a paragraph in 86.09421 or 86.09621 is identical and applicable to 86.09821,
this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. For guidance see
86.09421.'' or ``[Reserved]. For guidance see 86.09621.''. 

(a) through (b)(3) [Reserved]. For guidance see 86.09421. 

(b)(4)(i) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, a description of the test procedures to be used to establish
the evaporative emission and/or refueling emission deterioration factors (as applicable) required to be determined
and supplied in 86.09823(b)(2). 

(b)(4)(ii) through (iv) [Reserved]. For guidance see 86.09421. 

(b)(5)(v) For light-duty vehicles with non-integrated refueling emission control systems, the number of continuous
UDDS cycles, determined from the fuel economy on the UDDS applicable to the test vehicle of that evaporative/refueling
emission family-emission control system combination, required to use a volume of fuel equal to 85% of fuel tank volume.


(b)(6) through (8) [Reserved]. For guidance see 86.09421. 

(b)(9) For each light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, or heavy-duty vehicle evaporative/refueling emission family,
a description of any unique procedures required to perform evaporative and/or refueling emission tests (as applicable)
(including canister working capacity, canister bed volume, and fuel temperature profile for the running loss test)
for all vehicles in that evaporative/refueling emission family, and a description of the method used to develop those
unique procedures. 

(10) For each light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, or heavy-duty vehicle evaporative/refueling emission family:


(i) Canister working capacity, according to the procedures specified in 86.13296(h)(1)(iv); 

(ii) Canister bed volume; and 

(iii) Fuel temperature profile for the running loss test, according to the procedures specified in 86.12994(d).


(c) and (d) [Reserved]. For guidance see 86.09421. 

(e) For vehicles equipped with gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled heavy-duty engines, the manufacturer shall
specify a maximum nominal fuel tank capacity for each evaporative/refueling emission family-emission control
system combination. 

(f) through (i) [Reserved]. For guidance see 86.09421. 

(j) and (k) [Reserved]. For guidance see 86.09621.
