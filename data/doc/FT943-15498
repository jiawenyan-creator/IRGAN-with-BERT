FT  08 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei fails to find
direction but Sydney falls 1.5%
Tokyo
Tokyo would have been happier with a day's holiday, said dealers, as first
section turnover fell from 367.5m shares to an estimated 270m, and the
Nikkei index ended marginally easier, agencies report.
Uncertainty over currency direction and investor reluctance to move actively
ahead of the Group of Seven (G7) summit and settlement of July options kept
trade muted.
The three-day G7 summit in Naples, and July options settlement (SQ) both
start today. A Sanyo Securities trader said active trade was discouraged by
SQ and the fact that people know no fresh factors will emerge from the
summit.
'I wouldn't say that sentiment is bad,' he added. 'People have been going
for individual issues, especially stock linked to Aids and consumer
spending.'
For example, Kissei Pharmaceutical ended Y170 higher at Y4,420, and Japan
Energy Y13 better at Y487 on brisk turnover of 9.51m shares.
The Nikkei 225 average finished 9.01 down at 20,620.02, after a day's high
of 20.724.24 and low of 20,594.12. Mr Michio Sugita, general manager at
Deutsche Bank Capital Markets, said the market was slightly depressed by a
flurry of selling by a foreign securities house just before the close, but
dealers added that it picked up again as index-linked buying kicked in.
The Topix index of all first section stocks ended 2.22 off at 1,668.43 and
the Nikkei 300 eased 0.58 to 302.85, while falls led advances by 539 to 381,
with 246 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 5.37 at
1,356.82.
Advancing sectors were led by rolling stock, airlines, pharmaceuticals,
trucking, autos, credit/lease and food. The railways and buses sector posted
the largest loss, followed by ceramics, brokerages, miscellaneous
manufacturing, warehouses, retail and shipbuilding.
Hanwa fell Y21 to Y587 on talk that its main creditor or creditors may stop
helping in the restructuring of the financially troubled company.
Terumo, a market star in the previous two days, retreated Y50 to Y1,170 on
brisk profit-taking following a strong gain on its involvement in the
development of a three-dimensional television screen.
Roundup
Pacific Rim markets were mixed, as they remained wary about the outlook for
US interest rates.
SYDNEY fell sharply in afternoon trade, disheartened by a sell-off on the
futures market and weaker blue chips. The All Ordinaries index tumbled 29.0,
or 1.5 per cent, to 1,962.2.
Western Mining, which on Wednesday announced an alumina merger with Alcoa,
dipped 29 cents, or 4.1 per cent, to a two-month low of ADollars 6.73.
Among blue chip stocks, BHP lost 32 cents at ADollars 17.68, CRA fell 36
cents to ADollars 17.70 and News Corp, which on Wednesday said it had
purchased a 1.7 per cent stake in rival newspaper group John Fairfax
Holdings, dropped 14 cents to ADollars 8.16. Fairfax closed 10 cents, or 3.7
per cent, firmer at ADollars 2.80.
HONG KONG saw early losses reversed as a dip below 8,300 in the Hang Seng
index triggered bargain hunting. The index ended a net 35.94 up at 8,490.86
in turnover that rose to a provisional HKDollars 3.2bn from Wednesday's
HKDollars 1.9bn.
The early decline was attributed to news that Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
had reported a 34 per cent drop in mortgage lending in June.
HSBC finished steady at HKDollars 83, but among property issues, Cheung Kong
slipped 50 cents to HKDollars 31.30, Henderson Land 20 cents to HKDollars
33.90 and Hongkong Land 25 cents to HKDollars 18.55. Sun Hung Kai Properties
put on 50 cents at HKDollars 42.70.
WELLINGTON edged lower, the NZSE-40 Capital index shedding 17.88 to
1,966.25, just off the year's low of 1,961.30 set on May 27. Turnover picked
up, however, to a healthy NZDollars 46.3m as investors continued to switch
to larger stocks exposed to recovering commodity prices and the world
economy, and away from second liners.
Fay Richwhite, the merchant bank, fell 10 cents to 60 cents after saying on
Wednesday that it would just break even for the year.
MANILA firmed slightly at the close on some late bargain hunting in PLDT and
Manila Electric. The composite index added 1.43 at 2,629.23.
The newly listed SM Prime Holdings cornered the bulk of trading but ended
unchanged at 5.50 pesos. PLDT stayed at its year's low of 1,540 pesos, but
Meralco 'B' shares, open to all investors, climbed 2.3 per cent to 332.50
pesos.
SEOUL was pulled down by sales of shares heavily weighted on the index, but
elsewhere there were selective gains in small and medium-capitalised shares.
The composite index lost 7.77 at 945.71.
Investment trust companies were seen to be active sellers ahead of an August
10 deadline for repaying Won2,100bn in soft loans to the central bank.
TAIPEI saw early gains eroded and closed slightly lower, but brokers
expected that strong demand for electronics and petrochemicals would
continue to support the market in the near term.
The weighted index fell 19.84 to 6,095.34 in turnover that remained active
at TDollars 75bn, but below Wednesday's TDollars 86.52bn.
SINGAPORE was broadly lower on a lack of institutional interest and the
Straits Times Industrial index receded 20.76 to 2,146.01. Much of the
decline was attributed to Fraser &amp; Neave, down 70 cents at SDollars 15.70 on
news that its Coca-Cola venture in Ho Chi Mihn has been put on hold.
KUALA LUMPUR finished softer in moderate trade, pressured by blue-chip
selling. The composite index dipped 13.99 to 981.37.
Among blue chips, Tenaga was marked 50 cents lower to MDollars 13.30 after a
brokerage report suggested that the power giant would be adversely affected
by competition from independent producers after the launch of a Malaysian
power grid code.
BANGKOK rebounded from the day's lows on a flurry of last-minute buying. The
SET index closed 5.41 higher at 1,302.86.
Jasmine International, which made its debut on the market, closed at Bt320
compared with its initial public offering price of Bt345.
BOMBAY ended lower after a midsession recovery was not sustained. The BSE
30-share index retreated 49.72 to 4,048.61, with local investors unwilling
to commit fresh funds.
