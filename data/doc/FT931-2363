FT  20 MAR 93 / Electricity licence for Marc Rich
THE MARC RICH commodities trading organisation, which is based in
Switzerland, has become the first foreign company to be awarded a licence to
supply electricity in England and Wales.
Rich claims to be second only to Cargill, the US group, among the world's
diversified trading houses, concentrating particularly on oil and aluminium.
It publishes no accounts but Mr Marc Rich, who has built up the group since
1974, says turnover is about Dollars 30bn (Pounds 21bn) a year while the net
worth is about Dollars 1bn.
Rich will supply very large industrial customers, each with demand for at
least 1MW in any half-hour period , with electricity it buys from the 'pool'
or the wholesale market.
