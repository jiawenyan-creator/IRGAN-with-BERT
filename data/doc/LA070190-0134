U.S. PEACE CORPS WORKER SEIZED IN PHILIPPINES 
The U.S. Embassy said today that Communist rebels had kidnaped an American 
Peace Corps volunteer and were holding him on the central island of Negros. 
Last week, the United States recalled the 261 Peace Corps volunteers in the 
Philippines after intelligence reports indicated that Communist rebels might 
try to kill or kidnap the volunteers. 
American authorities had said previously that all the volunteers were accounted 
for. The volunteers began leaving the Philippines on Friday. 
U.S. officials identified the missing man as Timothy Swanson, 26, of Cheyenne, 
Wyo., who had been in the Philippines since February, 1988. 
A retired Roman Catholic bishop said Swanson had been friendly with New 
People's Army guerrillas. 
Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager it was believed the volunteer was abducted 
June 13. He said the embassy had made unsuccessful attempts to contact Swanson 
when the withdrawal of the Peace Corps volunteers was announced. 
Father Antonio Fortich, the retired Roman Catholic bishop of Negros, said in a 
telephone interview that Swanson's Filipino wife told him rebels had taken the 
volunteer from his home in the village of Patag. She said she was told to say 
nothing about the matter, he said.
