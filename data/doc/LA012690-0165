THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA 
Philippe Bent's tall, shyly articulated sculpture moves an old '40s idea of 
"drawing in space" into a postmodern dimension. Anchored to the floor with 
teeny tripods, miniature "feet" or small curving shapes, these pieces shoot 
upward as single or double wires -- straight, wavy or curved. 
They tend to fizz gently on top, way above your head, like the kind of 
fireworks you set off early in the evening. 
A nervous, austere brand of whimsy enters into the work of this French artist, 
with its clutch of anthropomorphic, landscape and language referents. 
Pieces are related to doodling, to high-tech furniture design, to the work of 
Kandinsky and Miro, and to self-effacing, minimal sculpture. Bent's metal rods 
are covered with resin-soaked cotton wool, which gives them the look of fine 
strings about to snap with the tension of never raising their voices above a 
whisper. 
Fred Stonehouse's painted devil heads are a bitter, damaged lot. They chomp on 
cigars, weep blood tears, grow big noses, disappear into tornadoes, spit up 
fountains. Some seem to carry the world's griefs on their shoulders; others 
seem to gloat over the way they've screwed things up. 
A young Milwaukee artist, Stonehouse began painting his devils on book pages as 
if in irreverent homage to the tradition of illustrated manuscripts. Animated 
by a pungent humanity akin to that of folk art, these small images are most 
unusual in using a Christian symbol to speak without cant to jaded viewers.
