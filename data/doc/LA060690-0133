SAGA COMES FULL CIRCLE 
And so, 200 years later, the battle for the village of San Juan Capistrano 
continues. The padres fought the wilderness to establish their mission; today 
the villagers fight the developers and politicians to protect the wilderness 
and the village. 
Has this saga come full circle? Are the padres and the villagers again fighting 
a concrete wilderness -- e.g., the Franciscan Plaza, traffic signals that don't 
relieve the traffic congestion, meadows and hillsides designated for 
high-density housing tracts, shopping malls and a new civic center that would 
further destroy our environment and mission village? 
As more wondrous artifacts are discovered, the politicians voice much concern, 
then proceed to cover them up with monstrous buildings. Should they not be more 
concerned with our quality of life? 
Although ours may seem a small conflict, it is significant worldwide, for we, 
as residents of San Juan and citizens of this planet, must learn from our 
lessons of the past to preserve and protect our future.
