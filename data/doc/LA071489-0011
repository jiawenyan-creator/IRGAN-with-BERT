A tanker carrying desperately needed fuel for Lebanon's besieged Christians 
broke through a Syrian blockade, sparking heavy artillery battles in Beirut. 
Police reported three people killed and 10 wounded in shelling duels that raged 
for hours, further undermining cease-fire efforts by Arab League envoys. Police 
said the tanker docked at the port of Byblos, 19 miles north of Beirut, 
triggering a fierce Syrian bombardment as it begun unloading its cargo. 
Christian army gunners retaliated, firing at the Syrian batteries in Muslim 
West Beirut.
