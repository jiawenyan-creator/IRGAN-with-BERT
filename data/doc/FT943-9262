FT  12 AUG 94 / Passports plan for export cattle
The government is to consider issuing passports for cattle destined for
export, Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, said yesterday.
The move follows the imposition of tighter European Union rules on the sale
of beef carcasses to the Continent because of fears over 'mad cow' disease.
The EU introduced regulations three weeks ago saying that beef carcasses
cannot be exported from Britain unless traders can show certificates proving
that the animals have not been exposed to bovine spongiform encephalitis
(BSE) for the past six years. This is an increase from two years.
Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, and
representatives of the meat trade met Mr Waldegrave yesterday to highlight
the problems caused by the new rules.
Many farmers had in effect been cut off from the export market because of
the difficulties involved in providing the necessary certificates.
Mr Waldegrave said cattle passports could be introduced on a voluntary basis
to speed up the checking of cattle for export.
The document would record the name and address of each owner of an animal as
well as any auction markets through which it had passed.
The agriculture ministry will help exporters to trace the history of animals
by releasing names and addresses of farms which have not had a case of BSE
in the past six years.
Sir David said the measures were a step in the right direction 'but there
are still many practical steps that need to be taken to ensure a continual
flow of the maximum amount of beef eligible for export'.
