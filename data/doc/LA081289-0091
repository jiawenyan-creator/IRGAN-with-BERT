U.N. TROOPS ATTACKED IN NAMIBIA 
Gunmen have attacked U.N. troops for the first time since they arrived to 
police Namibia's progress toward independence, and the United Nations on Friday 
condemned the assaults as terrorism. 
A commercial security guard was killed when unidentified gunmen threw grenades 
and fired guns from a vehicle at a U.N. post in the northern Namibian town of 
Outjo. 
A similar attack, in which no one was injured, was made on an Outjo military 
compound where Kenyan troops are billeted. 
Nobody claimed responsibility for the Thursday evening attacks, the first on 
U.N. troops since they arrived April 1 to supervise Namibia's transition to 
independence from South Africa next year.
