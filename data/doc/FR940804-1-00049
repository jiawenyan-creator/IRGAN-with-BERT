 

The Service made a final ``not warranted'' finding on the 1975 
petition with respect to 

L. g. 

ssp. 

parishii 

and 864 other species in 
the December 9, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 6482845). One reason was 
cited as the basis for this finding on this species that was based upon 
data not then available to the Service in late summer 1993: current 
threats (i.e., the five factors described below under 50 CFR 424.11) 
throughout a significant portion of the species' range. The species was 
retained in Category 2 on the basis that it may be subject to extinction 
or endangerment from uncontrolled loss of habitat or from other 
man-caused changes to its environment (58 FR 64840). Since the summer 
of 1993, the Service has completed or obtained survey and other data 
that adequately describe those factors that are placing 

L. g. 

ssp. 


parishii 

at risk of extinction. The Service has proceeded to propose 
this species along with the Lake Cuyamaca downingia that occupies the 
same general part of southern California. 


On December 14, 1990, the Service received a petition dated 
December 5, 1990, from Mr. David Hogan of the San Diego Biodiversity 
Project, to list 

Downingia concolor 

ssp. 

brevior 

(=

D. c. 

var. 

brevior) 


as an endangered species. The petitioner also requested the designation 
of critical habitat for this species. The Service evaluated the 
petitioner's requested action for 

D. c. 

var. 

brevior 

and published a 90-
day finding on August 30, 1991 (56 FR 42968) that substantial 
information existed indicating that the requested action may be 
warranted. Publication of this proposal constitutes the final finding 
that the petitioned action is warranted for this species. 



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 



Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) 
and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the listing 
provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the 
Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or 
threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in 
section 4(a)(1) and 50 CFR 424.11. These factors and their application 
to 

Downingia concolor 

E. Greene var. 

brevior 

McVaugh (Cuyamaca Lake 
downingia) and 

Limnanthes gracilis 

Howell ssp. 

parishii 

(Jepson) Beauch 
(Parish's meadowfoam) are as follows: 



A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or 
Curtailment of its Habitat or Range



Impacts that result in the loss, 
degradation, and fragmentation of vernally moist wet meadows are 
contributing to the decline of 

Limnanthes gracilis 

ssp. 

parishii 

and 


Downingia concolor 

var. 

brevior

. The habitat for both these taxa is 
threatened by recreational developments, off-road vehicle use, 
trampling, alterations of hydrology and the introduction of exotic 
plants. 

Historically, montane wet meadow and vernal pool habitats were 
much more abundant in the Peninsular Ranges of San Diego County (Winter 
1991). The wet meadows surrounding Cuyamaca Lake reservoir support the 
most significant populations of 

Limnanthes gracilis 

ssp. 

parishii 

and 


Downingia concolor 

var. 

brevior

. The entire Cuyamaca Valley was 
originally a montane meadow-vernal pool complex. Dredging during dam 
construction in 1886 altered the natural topography of the valley and 
its vernal pools. Mima mounds were likely excavated since ``much of the 
earth used for the dam was taken from the meadow north of the dam and 
from the valley floor'' (Allen and Curto 1987). Later, 160 ha (400 ac) 
of the valley outside the reservoir was leased from Helix Water District 
and planted in grain. 


Loss of wet meadow habitat continues as a result of excessive 
water inundation at Cuyamaca Lake reservoir and within Cuyamaca Valley 
above the dike. Studies of 

Limnanthes gracilis 

ssp. 

parishii 

and 


Downingia concolor 

var. 

brevior

, conducted between 1988 and 1992, have 
demonstrated that extended inundation at Cuyamaca Lake caused 
extirpation of stands for these two species (Bauder 1992). The 
reservoir provides domestic water, flood control, and recreational 
activities such as fishing and duck hunting. These uses are 
administered through agreements between the Helix Water District, the 
City of San Diego's El Capitan Reservoir, and Lake Cuyamaca Recreation 
and Park District (Bauder 1992). Approximately 81 ha (150 ac) of 
potential meadow habitat are permanently inundated. The system of dikes 
built in 1967 allows an additional 273 ha (675 ac) to be inundated for 
extended periods of time during periods of high precipitation; that 
occurred as recently as 1993 (Hugh Marks, Cuyamaca Lake Recreation and 
Parks District Manager, pers. comm., 1993). 

L. gracilis 

ssp. 

parishii 


is less able to recover from excessive inundation than 

D. concolor 

var. 


brevior, as shown by the lack of re-establishment in areas of previous 
inundation (Bauder 1992). 


A variety of indirect impacts are associated with the diversion of 
water entering the Cuyamaca Lake reservoir basin. Diversion often 
results in the alteration of small drainages by down cutting and 
streambank erosion, which contributes to the loss of potentially 
suitable habitat upstream of Cuyamaca Lake. Fluctuating lake levels 
also increase channel erosion by changing the gradient and velocity of 
surrounding drainages. Erosion is further intensified by the decrease 
in groundwater levels caused by numerous wells in the area. When 
streamflow velocities are high, Downingia 

and 

Limnanthes 

seeds and 
plants can be buried or washed away. In dry years, meadows exposed by 
the receding shoreline dry prematurely as the groundwater level falls. 
Roads without adequate culverts also divert water flow. Road 
maintenance and herbicidal weed abatement often preclude the re-
establishment of seeds in areas of suitable habitat (Bauder 1992). In 
addition, the alteration of hydrology in Cuyamaca Valley promotes the 
invasion of exotic species (e.g., Lolium perenne (ryegrass) and 

Poa 
pratensis 

(Kentucky bluegrass)) known to displace native plant species. 
These indirect effects can have significant, long-term impacts on the 
meadow habitats and associated sensitive plant species. 


Direct loss of both species' habitat at the reservoir is 
substantial. For example, a parking lot and a campground on the south 
end of Cuyamaca Lake reservoir at Los Caballos have displaced habitat 
(Bauder 1992). The Prado campground on the Cleveland National Forest 
also displaced 

Limnanthes gracilis 

ssp. 

parishii 

(Devoree Volgarino, 
Cleveland National Forest, pers. comm., 1993). The construction of a 
Boy Scout trail in 1976 destroyed a population of 

L. g. 

ssp. 

parishii 

in 
Canebrake Canyon, north of Cuyamaca Lake (CNDDB 1992). A trail around 
the perimeter of Cuyamaca Lake bisects several populations of both 
species (Ellen Bauder, Ph.D., Department of Biology, San Diego State 
University, pers. comm., 1993).
