  [Text] Beijing, June 20 (AFP)--Severe flooding in six 
Chinese provinces has claimed 438 lives in the past 12 days and 
left another 6,470 injured, the Ministry of Civil Affairs said 
Monday [20 June]. Releasing provisional figures, the ministry 
said more than 48 million people had been affected by flooding, 
with 482,000 homes destroyed and three million hectares (7.4 
million acres) of farmland under water. 
  Hardest hit was Guangdong province, with 134 dead and 52 
missing, as major rivers swollen by torrential rains threatened 
the prosperous Pearl River delta, near Hong Kong. Elsewhere, 
120 had died in Hunan, 82 in Guangxi, 50 in Zhejiang, 32 in 
Jiangxi and 20 in Fujian. Economic losses were put at 16.86 
billion yuan (two billion dollars), the ministry said, adding 
that international aid was welcome.
