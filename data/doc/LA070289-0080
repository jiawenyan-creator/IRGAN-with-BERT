PAUL DOKTOR, 70, VIENNESE-BORN VIOLIST FAMED AS SOLOIST, DIES 
Paul Doktor, a Viennese-born violist who was one of the few devotees of his 
instrument to establish a career as a soloist, has died in New York City. 
The New York Times reported that he died June 21 at age 70 of a heart attack 
while undergoing tests at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. 
Known for his teaching as well as for performing, Doktor graduated from the 
Vienna Academy of Music in 1938; in 1942 he became the first violist to win the 
Geneva International Music Competition. 
He had left Vienna in 1938 and, after performing for several years in Europe, 
particularly Switzerland, moved to the United States in 1948. 
In this country he taught at the Philadelphia Academy, Juilliard School of 
Music and New York University. From 1972 to 1975 he was a member of the New 
String Trio of New York.
