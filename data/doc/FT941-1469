FT  25 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Europe urged to set health goals
Other countries in Europe should follow Britain's example and set specific
targets for the health of their citizens, the Financial Times World
Pharmaceuticals Conference in London was told yesterday.
Mr David Anstice, who heads the European pharmaceutical business of Merck,
the largest US drug company, said governments were obsessed with financial
accountability and neglected their parallel responsibility for improving
health. 'To achieve these improvements, governments should identify
priorities and set measurable national health targets.' The only example so
far, he said, was the 1992 UK White Paper on health, which identified five
priority areas with targets for the year 2000.
If such targets were taken seriously, they would encourage governments to
spend their drugs budgets more wisely, Mr Anstice said. At present they
waste money on cheap but ineffective 'comfort medicines' without patent
protection, when they could get better value by encouraging doctors to
prescribe more effective new drugs.
The pharmaceutical industry has traditionally focused its marketing and
promotional activity on the doctor, rather than the patient.
But the message to the conference from Mr Thomas Moore, president of Procter
&amp; Gamble's US pharmaceutical business, was: 'Don't forget the consumer.'
Mr Moore said most drug companies lacked the marketing skills required to
sustain a profitable long-term income from products which switched from
prescription-only to over-the-counter status.
The normal approach was to milk them for short-term profits rather than
creating brand loyalty.
Mr Kurt Briner, president of France's Sanofi Pharma, agreed that 'in
addition to supporting a growing share of the expense, patients want to have
more say in the choice of drugs prescribed. This attitude is rapidly gaining
momentum.'
