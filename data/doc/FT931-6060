FT  03 MAR 93 / Observer: Return of the native
When, in late 1990, Barclays Bank paid through the nose to buy the highly
regarded Bavarian private bank, Merck Finck &amp; Co, and immediately insisted
on making one of its own men a partner, there were knowing glances in rival
banking parlours. Was Barclays trying to show off on Deutsche Bank's home
turf?
Why interfere? Midland and Lloyds don't have any of their men masquerading
as partners of Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt and Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst
respectively, yet this has not prevented these banks from doing well. If
Merck Finck had been in trouble, as SMH once was, there might have been a
reason for putting a Brit into the partnership. But this was not the case.
Now, little more than two years later, Giles Davison, the Barclays partner
on the Merck letterhead, is quitting after 34 years with Barclays. Richard
Carden, Barclays' European boss, admits that there were policy differences
but beyond that is staying 'stumm'.
Merck Finck, by contrast, is unusually talkative. Of Davison, who was
relishing Munich's business and cultural whirl, spokesman Otto Gassner says:
'I cannot imagine anyone else who would have fitted in so well. It is a blow
to Merck Finck.' Sounds like old Davison might have gone a bit too native
for Barclays' comfort.
As for the rumoured policy differences, Gassner is happy to chip in his
thoughts. 'Merck Finck is always the playground in which conflicts between
the commercial and investment banking sides of the Barclays Group are worked
out.' Ouch.
Another sign of the power vacuum which some think currently exists at the
top of Barclays? Perhaps. But whatever the reason for the apparent
contretemps, some of Barclays' rivals will be permitting themselves a sly
smile.
