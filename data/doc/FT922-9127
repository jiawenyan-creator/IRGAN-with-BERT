FT  09 MAY 92 / Swan Hunter pay offer is rejected
HOURLY paid workers at Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilders, yesterday
rejected a two-year pay deal in spite of a recommendation from their shop
stewards to accept. The offer consists of three lump-sum payments this year
totalling Pounds 275, and an inflation-linked pay rise with a 4.5 per cent
ceiling in April next year. Talks are expected to be held next week between
the management, which has described the offer as final, and union
representatives.
