FT  05 JUL 93 / Azeri town set to fall to Armenia
ARMENIAN forces from the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday closed in
on the Azerbaijan town of Agdam which came under heavy shelling and is now
likely to fall within the next 24 hours.
The defenders of the town, the bridgehead of Azeri defences, have been told
by the Azeri government to hold the town at all costs. However, they say
that only 250 poorly armed reinforcements have been sent from Baku.
Almost all the villages around the town are now in Armenian hands and there
is only one road out for the Azeris. The route is choked with refugees,
mainly women, children and old men fleeing from the stricken town. According
to Agdam officials last night the Armenians are already in the city suburbs.
Shelling and small arms fire is continuous in and around the city centre and
the defenders say there is little or no ammunition left for the few tanks
they have.
Mr Alsif Sherimov, the deputy mayor, said yesterday that some 14 villages
had been taken by the Armenian forces. He also said it now seemed impossible
to hold the town. The new Azeri prime minister, Suret Guseinov, issued an
urgent appeal for all men with military training to report for duty soon or
face punishment.
'All Azeri soldiers must report for duty by July 8. Those who do not obey
this call will face the heaviest punishment,' he said in the appeal read for
him on television.
Mr Guseinov, who became premier last week after heading an army revolt
against elected President Abulfaz Elchibey, said that able-bodied men should
not join the column of refugees now streaming towards Baku.
The town hospital has been emptied of wounded who have joined the women and
children in trucks and farm carts leaving the city. All around the villages
are burning and the suburbs of the town are the site of pitched battles
between the defenders and Armenian attackers.
Mr Sherimov and his colleagues said they would attempt to hold the town as
long as possible.
