  [Text] Taipei, March 2 (CNA) -- Several Republic of China 
[ROC] legislators Wednesday [2 March] quoted US customs 
statistics which show that the US is the world's sixth largest 
source of intellectual property rights (IPR) infringements and 
demanded the US better police its computer software exports. 
  Five Kuomintang legislators, including Lin Shou-shan and Lin 
Chih-chia, called on the Clinton administration to require the 
same export inspections of US software as the US Trade 
Representative officials have recommended for Taipei. 
  Noting that US customs statistics show US IPR violations are 
only one percent behind those of Taiwan, the legislators called 
for equal treatment for the two countries. 
  "It is fair to ask the US to impose a similar export 
inspection system to curb IPR violation," they said in a joint 
statement released Wednesday morning. 
  The statement also called on the US to revise its patent law 
to add prison terms for IPR violators, as Taiwan is being asked 
to do the same. 
  Legislators Ting Shou-chung, Wei Yung and Chao Yung-ching 
also signed the statement.
