 

2.3.1Water-heating clothes washers.

 The temperature of the water supply shall be maintained at a minimum of 55 
&cir;F (12.8 
&cir;C) and a maximum of 60 
&cir;F (15.6 
&cir;C). 

(iii) Sections 3.2.1 through 3.3.5 in Appendix J shall be deleted and replaced with the following: 

3.2.1

Per-cycle electrical energy consumption at maximum fill.

 Set the water level selector to the maximum fill position, if manually controlled. 

3.2.1.1

Hottest wash at maximum fill.

 Activate the machine and insert the appropriate test load as specified in 2.8.2.1. Select the normal or its
equivalent wash cycle. Where spin speed selection is available, set the control to its maximum setting. Set the water
temperature selector to the hottest setting and activate the wash cycle. Measure and record the kilowatt-hours of
electrical energy consumed for the complete cycle as E

ht,max

.

3.2.1.2

Hot wash at maximum fill.

 Insert a water temperature sensing device inside the inner drum prior to testing. Activate the machine and insert
the appropriate test load as specified in 2.8.2.1. Select the normal or its equivalent wash cycle. Where spin
speed selection is available, set the control to its maximum setting. Set the water temperature selector to the hot
setting (a minimum of 140 
&cir;F (60 
&cir;C) and a maximum of 145 
&cir;F (62.8 
&cir;C)) and activate the wash cycle. Verify the wash water temperature, which must be at a minimum of 140 
&cir;F (60 
&cir;C) and a maximum of 145 
&cir;F (62.8 
&cir;C). If the measured water temperature is not within the specified range, stop testing, adjust the temperature
selector accordingly and repeat the procedure. Otherwise, proceed and complete testing. Measure and record the
kilowatt-hours of electrical energy consumed for the complete cycle as E

h,max

.

3.2.1.3

Warm wash at maximum fill.

 Repeat 3.2.1.2 for a warm wash setting at a minimum of 100 
&cir;F (37.8 
&cir;C) and a maximum of 105 
&cir;F (40.6 
&cir;C). Measure and record the kilowatt-hours of electrical energy consumed for the complete cycle as E

w,max

.

3.2.1.4

Cold wash at maximum fill.

 Repeat 3.2.1.1 for the coldest water setting. Measure and record the kilowatt-hours of electrical energy
consumed for the complete cycle as E

c,max

. Ensure that the inlet water temperature is maintained per 2.3.1.

3.2.2

Per-cycle electrical energy consumption at minimum fill.

 Set the water level selector to the minimum fill position, if manually controlled. 

3.2.2.1

Hottest wash at minimum fill.

 Repeat 3.2.1.1 for a test load as specified in 2.8.2.1. Measure and record the kilowatt-hours of electrical
energy consumed for the complete cycle as E

ht,min

.

3.2.2.2

Hot wash at minimum fill.

 Repeat 3.2.1.2 for a test load as specified in 2.8.2.1. The hot wash setting shall be at a minimum of 140

&cir;F (60 
&cir;C) and a maximum of 145 
&cir;F (62.8 
&cir;C). Measure and record the kilowatt-hours of electrical energy consumed for the complete cycle as E

3.2.2.3

Warm wash at minimum fill.

 Repeat 3.2.1.2 for warm wash setting at a minimum of 100 
&cir;F (37.8 
&cir;C) and a maximum of 105 
&cir;F (40.6 
&cir;C). Measure and record the kilowatt-hours of electrical energy consumed for the complete cycle as E

w,min

.

3.2.2.4

Cold wash at minimum fill.

 Repeat 3.2.1.1 for the coldest wash setting. Measure and record the kilowatt-hours of electrical energy consumed
for the complete cycle as E

c,min

. Ensure that the inlet water temperature is maintained per 2.3.1.

(iv) Sections 4.1 through 4.6 in Appendix J shall be deleted and replaced with the following: 

4.1

Per-cycle temperature-weighted machine electrical energy consumption for maximum and minimum water fill levels.

 Calculate the per-cycle temperature-weighted electrical energy consumption for the maximum water fill level,
E
