FT  26 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses respond well to
overnight gains in Dow
Bourses responded to overnight gains on Wall Street, and lost relatively
little in the afternoon when the Dow improved from early weakness, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was led higher by banks, carmakers and the utilities sector as the
Dax index closed 25.84, or 1.2 per cent higher at 2,152.21.
Turnover rose from DM6.9bn to DM7.3bn. Short covering grew to a wave and
Commerzbank, Deutsche and Dresdner rose by DM5.80 to DM328, DM11 to DM712.50
and DM7 to DM405.50 respectively.
In the automotive list, BMW rose DM10 to DM814 and Daimler by DM17.50 to
DM812.50 but Volkwagen, still depressed by the apparently gloomy remarks
about industry prospects from its chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, recovered
only DM2.50 on the session. A magazine interview with Mr Piech, raising
hopes of a higher 1994 dividend, took the shares up another DM4.50 to
DM484.50 in the post-bourse.
There was good news on the inflation front, with preliminary data showing
western Germany's consumer price levels in line with market expectations and
the utilities, interest rate sensitive, responded with RWE DM9 better at
DM459, Veba up DM8.20 at DM548 and Viag DM7.40 higher at DM494.70 ahead of
today's half-year results.
In chemicals, Bayer's commendable 24 per cent gain in first half pre-tax
profits left the shares only DM1 higher at DM367. Hoechst, also due to
report today, rose DM6 to DM353.50.
PARIS was said to be fuelled by fresh liquidity arriving with the start of
the September trading account, but bond futures reduced their gains in the
afternoon and the equity market closed off its best with the CAC 40 index
20.23 higher at 2,026.52, after a high of 2,040.53.
Financials had a good day. Banks were even more generally strong than on
Wednesday, Paribas and Suez climbing FFr11.40 to FFr361.30, and FFr7.50 to
FFr268.50,the latter after reports of a big buy order, while Bancaire rose
FFr19.90, or 4.3 per cent to FFr484.90.
In insurers, the soon to be privatised AGF was a leading gainer in the blue
chip category, helped by remarks from its chairman, Mr Antoine
Jeancourt-Galignani, who told a French magazine that the first half numbers
were very favorable, with gains in profitability in every area of activity.
AGF results will be released next Wednesday.
Turnover was relatively weak at FFr2.2bn. Canal Plus, the pay television
group, staged a partial recovery of FFr7 to FFr918 after earlier weakness on
unconfirmed reports that the government will burden the company with hefty
financial obligations when its broadcasting licence is renewed.
AMSTERDAM took heart from some strong company results which lifted the AEX
index by 3.69 points to 417.73 in fairly active trading.
ING's results boosted the financial sector while the insurer's own shares
rose Fl 1.80 to Fl 80.80. Fortis Amev gained Fl 0.90 to Fl 74.70, while
Aegon rose Fl 2.20 to Fl 101.80 and ABN Amro advanced Fl 0.60 to Fl 62.30
ahead of first-half results.
KPN, the telecoms and postal group which turned in better than expected
profits, climbed Fl 1.30 to Fl 53.10. Internatio-Mueller, the transport
group which also produced strong results earlier in the week, added another
Fl 1.80 to Fl 88.20.
Pakhoed continued to suffer from figures below expectations, falling Fl 0.90
to FL 48 after a decline on Wednesday. Brokers expressed disappointment that
the group's European operations did not perform better.
ZURICH firmed on the back of the Dow's overnight spurt but lost momentum in
the afternoon as volume thinned. The SMI index increased 10.0 to 2,551.1,
off its intraday high of 2,563.2.
A mixed tone in US bonds yesterday, and a slightly softer opening on Wall
Steet dampened sentiment in the afternoon.
Alusuisse advanced SFr8 to SFr688 ahead of its interim report next week.
However, MrHans Kaufmann at Bank Julius Baer said that positive first-half
results had probably been factored into the share's price. Other cyclicals
also firmed.
Banks ended mixed, with UBS rising SFr12 to SFr1,109, SBC unchanged at
SFr272 and CS Holding dipping SFr1 to SFr519.
MILAN continued to be influenced strongly by today's cabinet meeting which
is expected to give a much-awaited indication of the government's budget
plans. The market was looking for tough measures, particularly on pensions.
Investors stayed on the sidelines and in thin trading the Comit index
declined by 3.60 to 684.72. There was also seen to be continued technical
resistance at 690.
Olivetti was the one hot spot in a generally rudderless market. Traders were
mulling the possible effects of Digital Equipment's sale of its remaining
stake in the Italian company, a move which was confirmed on Wednesday.
Olivetti's shares fell L65 to L2,290 as rumours circulated that the sale had
made been at a low price.
Fiat also came in for some attention and its shares fell L70 to L6,485,
which dampened the market further.
Insurers also fell back after Wednesday's gains but were favoured on the
belief that they will benefit from budget changes.
DUBLIN rose by just short of 2 per cent, the ISEQ general index closing
35.54 higher at 1,859.75 on strength in financials and Jefferson Smurfit,
which closed 25p higher at 420p. Dealers said that the market had slipped
back recently on stories of a major upcoming cash call from Smurfit, but had
recovered on the feeling that it had become oversold, on strong gains in the
US and UK markets, and on strength in the US paper sector on Wednesday.
WARSAW continued to fall as profit-taking continued but there were signs
that buying pressure was building up to the point where it could produce a
rebound next week. The Wig index dropped 513.0, or 4.2 per cent to 11,458.2
as volume rose by 29 per cent to 1.8m shares.
