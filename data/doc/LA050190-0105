Principals Have a Cow Over Bart: Spiky-headed cartoon antihero Bart Simpson has 
been kicked out of two schools in different parts of the country. 
The principals of Cambridge Elementary School in Orange and Lutz Elementary 
School in Fremont, Ohio have discouraged students from wearing T-shirts bearing 
the likeness of the bug-eyed 10-year-old star of "The Simpsons." At issue is a 
shirt that boasts, "Under-achiever and proud of it, man." The principals say 
Bart teaches kids the wrong lesson, and that the Simpsons are not an 
appropriate family model for youngsters. GREG BRAXTON
