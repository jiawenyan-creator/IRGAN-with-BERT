  [Text] Caracas, 10 Apr (AFP) -- The Venezuelan Police have 
reported that 10 heavily armed individuals, alleged members of a 
Colombian drug trafficking-guerrilla column, today raided the 
Cachiche-Aramara Airport in Puerto Ayacucho, 520 km southeast of 
Caracas, hijacked a plane, and fled to Colombia. 
  A Caracas Radio Rumbos report indicated that the violent 
attack took place at 0600 (1000 GMT)--a time when more that 
1,000 members of the military and police forces quartered at the 
airport "were sound asleep." According to the radio station, 
the airport's traffic controller, whose name remained 
undisclosed, arrived as the plane was taking off with the 
attackers on board. 
  It was also reported that the raid by the alleged Colombian 
drug trafficking-guerrilla column took place at a time when 
members of the state security corps were in Puerto Ayacucho 
combing the area to rescue a Venezuelan citizen who was 
kidnapped 10 days ago. The plane, of which no details were 
released, belongs to the regional Puerto Ayacucho government.
