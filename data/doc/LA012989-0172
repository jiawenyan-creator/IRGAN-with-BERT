RED LIGHTS, FLASHING LIGHTS AND SIRENS 
Since drinking and driving is legal (hot coffee that is!) plus smoking and 
listening to stereo, sirens are often not heard. Assuming that the driver is 
still looking at the road he can see red stop lights. How about mandatory, 
automatic red lights that go on at all nearest intersections when sirens and/or 
flashing red lights go on -- and mandatory use of sirens and/or flashing red 
lights to prevent more carnage in police chases, which should be outlawed (a 
very unlikely event).
