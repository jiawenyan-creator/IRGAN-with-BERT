  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Ecuadoran economic developments monitored through 25 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  The Ecuadoran Central Bank has announced that Ecuador closed 
1993 with $1.253 billion in international reserves, the highest 
level reported in the country's history. In a press communique 
the Central Bank said these figures prove the effectiveness of 
the government's economic policy because it reduced inflation 
and strengthened the economy's position abroad. (Quito Voz de
