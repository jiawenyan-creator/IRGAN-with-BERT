FT  16 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
New York SILVER traders resumed their bullish stance after Wednesday's late
sell-off, lifting the metal's price sharply. In London the spot quotation
closed 10 cents up at Dollars 5.07 1/2 a troy ounce. Having found support at
Dollars 4.95 an ounce the market was buoyed by short-covering and bargain
hunting. GOLD recovered Wednesday's fall, closing in London at Dollars 394
an ounce, up Dollars 1.75. But dealers said confidence had been drained by
repeated failures to break decisively through the Dollars 400 barrier and
questioned whether profit-taking at Dollars 395 could be repelled. Robusta
COFFEE prices at the London Commodity Exchange surrendered more of their
early-week gain on disappointed liquidation following the continued
non-appearance of the predicted Brazilian frost. The September futures
price, which on Tuesday touched Dollars 1,016 a tonne, closed last night at
Dollars 991 a tonne, down Dollars 7 on the day. At the London Metal Exchange
ALUMINIUM prices continued Wednesday's recovery as buyers were encouraged by
expectations of solid underlying support appearing on any dips. The three
months price closed at Dollars 1,213.75 a tonne, up Dollars 10.25.
