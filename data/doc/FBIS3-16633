  [Text] Russia has nothing to do with the development of 
events in the Crimea. It's an internal affair of Ukraine. It's 
essential not to give the radical-minded politicians in Kiev a 
pretext for playing "the Crimean card" for the purpose of 
aggravating the confrontation in relations with Moscow, a senior 
Russian diplomat dealing with Ukrainian problems told Interfax. 
  In comments on President Leonid Kravchuk's decision to 
cancel 
the Crimean leader Yuriy Meshkov's decree to carry out a 
referendum on relations with Kiev, the Russian diplomat said: 
"So far the Ukrainian leadership has no weighty legal arguments. 
After all no one can forbid the Crimean president to hold 
consultations with the populace. As a matter of fact, this does 
not signify the Crimea's secession from Ukraine. A referendum 
may have no direct legal force." 
  According to Interfax's interviewee, it's necessary to take 
into account the circumstance that Leonid Kravchuk's statements 
as to Simferopol's responsibility "for the possible 
complications" in its relationship with Kiev may play "a 
destabilizing role."
