 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of the Air Force has added provisions for alternate use of Air Force airfields by commercial air carriers
that have contracted to participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program. It is necessary to identify the
CRAF Alternate as a purpose for which the Air Force will grant civil aircraft landing permits. The availability of
Air Force airfields for use as alternates by CRAF carriers is intended to encourage greater participation in the CRAF
program, which is structured to meet military airlift requirements during military emergencies that involve US
forces.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department of the Air Force has determined that this proposed rule is not a major rule because it will not have an
annual adverse effect on the economy of $100 million or more. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Manpower, Reserve
Affairs, Installations  Environment) has certified that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601612 because this rule does not have a significant economic impact on small entities
as defined by the Act, and does not impose any obligatory information requirements beyond internal Air Force use.
