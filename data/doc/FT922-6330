FT  26 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: UK utilities
However controversial the principles, the privatisation and regulation of
the UK's public utilities has been admired and even copied abroad.
Specifically, the notion that regulators should encourage competition and
efficiency, principally by controlling the prices charged by monopolies, is
seen as a welcome advance on the US system. The latter involves regulators
setting rates of return and then ensuring the utilities do not deviate. By
contrast, the UK model gives customers and competitors a clear idea of what
to expect, while allowing managers and shareholders alike to benefit from
genuine efficiency gains.
It is thus disturbing to perceive that UK regulators are in unwitting danger
of becoming more like their US counterparts. As Robert Fleming says, there
is a natural link between price-based and rate of return regulation. After
all, when a UK regulator sets a price cap, it assumes a judgment about the
underlying profitability of the company in question. That need not involve
an acceptance that the main basis of setting prices should be the rate of
return. But that is exactly what appears to have been happening.
Sir Bryan Carsberg's departure from Oftel could well be accompanied by an
agreement with BT on its inflation-linked price formula. The heart of the
debate, however, has not been the long-term effects of lower inflation on
the formula but BT's cost of capital, a benchmark for its rate of return. A
similar debate has begun in the water industry.
The main objection is not that rates of return are subject to arbitrary
judgments, although there is plenty to suggest that is the case. Rather, it
is that the implied approach is opposite to the original regulatory
intention of encouraging both competition and efficient management of
monopolies. Hapless investors might reasonably ask whether they should risk
a creeping change of such magnitude.
