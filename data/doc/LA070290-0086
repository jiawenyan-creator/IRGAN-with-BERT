ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; 
MASSIVE OLIVE-OIL SPILL CLOSES STREET 
Between 3,000 and 5,000 gallons of olive oil from a food processing plant oozed 
into nearby streets Sunday after vandals sabotaged a huge vat, police said. 
The oil, which flowed from Van Law Food Products Inc. about 3:50 p.m., forced 
the closure of South Cypress Street between Lambert Road and Imperial Highway 
for several hours. 
Police said that someone severed a hose attached to the vat inside the plant 
and then turned on a pump to start the spill. 
"It's a big mess," said La Habra Police Sgt. Ron Harryman. "A lot of drivers 
were having problems steering their cars." 
Police have no suspects or motives in the incident.
