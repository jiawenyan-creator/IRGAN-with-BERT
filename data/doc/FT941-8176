FT  22 FEB 94 / Observer: Not gilty?
Is Merrill Lynch a contrarian indicator for trends in UK government
securities? When the US securities house pulled out of the gilts market in
the late 1980s because the latter was overcrowded and unprofitable, it had
to sit on its hands and watch a really spectacular bull run.
Now, just as it has been granted permission to become a gilt-edged
marketmaker once again, the market is suffering a serious bout of weakness.
No doubt this time round, though, Merrill has had to reassure the Old Lady
of its stamina.
