FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Their Budget - The self-employed
Jack Holmstock, 44
Job: taxi driver. Formerly worked in local government and recruitment
Earns: about pounds 22,000 a year and has a mortgage of pounds 50,000 on his
east London house
Politics: votes Conservative
Wanted: an interest rate cut. 'As a mortgage payer this would make a
difference to us in particular. It would also have a big knock-on effect -
firms would take more people on, and more people would use cabs.'
First reaction: 'It is going to cost me. The increase in petrol affects me.
So does the increase in car tax. I don't smoke or drink, only a little wine,
so I will not be hit there. But we run a pounds 50,000 mortgage here and the
decrease in mortgage tax relief is going to hurt. On the plus side I was
glad there was not VAT on food and books. Also, I have two parents on
pensions so I was pleased to see them getting help with fuel bills.'
