FT  22 NOV 94 / Democracy call by Burma rebel
Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the detained Burmese pro-democracy campaigner,
yesterday urged the UN to support democratic movements and rejected the
argument, popular among east Asian governments, that authoritarian rule is
essential for the development of poor countries. Ms Suu Kyi, under house
arrest in Rangoon for more than five years, made her comments in a speech to
a UN conference in Manila read for her by Mrs Corazon Aquino, the former
Philippines president.
In the speech, Ms Suu Kyi criticised Asian and African governments for
portraying democracy as a 'western' concept alien to other cultures and for
suggesting that economic growth was the only important issue, a view that Ms
Suu Kyi said could be 'a recipe for disaster'. 'True development of human
beings involves much more than mere economic growth.' she said. After years
of dismissing Ms Suu Kyi as a troublemaker, Burma's military junta has
recently held two rounds of talks with her in Rangoon. 'Most totalitarian
regimes fear change,' Ms Suu Kyi said in her speech, 'but the longer they
put off genuine democratic reform, the more likely it is that even their
positive contributions will be vitiated.'
