FT  02 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Bank loses claim for negligence of
property valuers - Legal briefs
Commercial property valuers facing a pile of negligent valuation claims
arising from the collapse of the London commercial property market should
take heart from a High Court decision last week in a case brought by The
Private Bank &amp; Trust Company against Sallmanns (UK). The bank claimed to
have made advances relying on an allegedly negligent valuation made by
Sallmanns in June 1990 on an office development in north London. But the
Court ruled that the commercial property market in London had not collapsed
at June 1990 as the bank claimed and that the valuer could not reasonably
have been expected to foresee the speed and extent of the imminent collapse
in commercial property values. Hugh Williams, of solicitors Williams Davies
Meltzer, who represented the valuers, said: 'Encouragingly the court showed
itself willing to place itself in the position of the valuer at a critical
time in the commercial property market rather than adopting the hindsight
vision of pundits who claim subsequently to have been able to foresee the
market collapse and who suggest that the valuer in the field should likewise
have done so.'
