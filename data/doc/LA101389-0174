WORLD; 
KIDNAPED STEWARDESS RELEASED 
A Swiss airline stewardess abducted in northern Lebanon has been released into 
the custody of a senior Lebanese politician, a diplomatic source said today. 
The source said Syrian troops passed the unnamed woman into the custody of 
former President Suleiman Franjieh on Thursday after she was seized by 
unidentified gunmen Sunday. 
The source said her kidnaping had been a personal matter. He said pressure from 
the Swiss government had secured her release, and she had been asked to leave 
Lebanon and not return. At the request of her family her name was not released.
