FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Genentech profit growth 'to
continue'
Faster profits growth at the end of last year at Genentech, the US
biotechnology company, is likely to continue into this year following recent
new drug approvals, Mr Kirk Raab, president and chief executive, said
yesterday.
His projection came as the company reported fourth quarter net income ahead
of market expectations at Dollars 18.7m, or 16 cents a share, compared with
Dollars 6.2m, or 5 cents a share, a year before.
The improved performance came on the back of strong sales growth from
Activase, revenues from which rose 30 per cent to Dollars 236m during the
year, giving it a two-thirds market share in the US. Sales of the company's
other big drug, the human growth hormone Protropin, rose 5 per cent to
Dollars 217m during the year.
