FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Cereal gains help raise Tate &amp; Lyle to
Pounds 131m
Higher profits from cereal sweeteners and starches helped Tate &amp; Lyle
increase interim pre-tax profits by 21.7 per cent to a better-than-expected
Pounds 130.9m.
The improvement in the cereal side more than offset lower profits from cane
and beet sugar operations. Mr Neil Shaw, chairman, said that profits in the
half-year to March 26 were greater than in the whole of 1988.
The outlook for the rest of the financial year to September 'remains
encouraging', he added. The interim dividend has been raised by 7 per cent
to 4.6p.
Group sales were up 7.5 per cent to Pounds 1.98bn, and operating profits
rose 14.5 per cent to Pounds 145.6m. Associate profits were ahead from
Pounds 4.8m to Pounds 6.2m. Net interest fell by Pounds 3.5m to Pounds
20.9m, with net borrowings down nearly Pounds 10m from Pounds 755.2m to
Pounds 745.4m.
Debt remained high as a proportion of net assets of Pounds 882.4m, up from
Pounds 820.9m, and will rise as a consequence of the Pounds 63.8m purchase
of a majority stake in Orsan, the French food additives business, announced
on Tuesday.
Mr Shaw said the Orsan deal was an important strategic move for Tate, taking
it into a new area - monosodium glutamate - and linking it with Ajinomoto,
the large Japanese food group.
Mr Paul Lewis, finance director, said that Pounds 100m invested in eastern
Europe was now beginning to see a return as activities there more than broke
even.
During the half-year, there was a further recovery in profits at Staley, the
US starches operation, which had suffered badly in 1992 from industry
overcapacity and the loss of Pepsi as a customer, as demand increased and
prices improved. Operating profits rose 39.5 per cent to Pounds 48.7m. 2
European cereal starch and sweetener profits rose 39.1 per cent to Pounds
29.9m, with an even greater margin gain, from 8.9 to 12.2 per cent.
Sugar refining profits fell although sales rose. In North America sales rose
9.6 per cent, but lower profits in Canada cut operating profits for the
region 4 per cent to Pounds 16.6m, as a sugar surplus affected prices.
Within that Domino, the US beet sugar refiner, increased profits.
In the UK, sugar refining profits were down from Pounds 33.7m to Pounds
30.6m, hit by a Pounds 3.3m pension provision.
After a higher tax rate, fully diluted earnings per share rose 12.6 per cent
to 17.9p.
