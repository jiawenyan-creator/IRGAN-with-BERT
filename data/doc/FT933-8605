FT  14 AUG 93 / International Company News: Sales fall at French groups
RHONE-POULENC, Michelin and Suez have underlined the financial pressures on
French industry by announcing sharp falls in turnover for the first half of
the year.
The reductions in interim sales reflect the general trend across the French
corporate sector, which has been badly hit by the recession. Domestic
difficulties were aggravated by the franc's strength during the first half
of the year, which posed problems for French exporters.
Rhone-Poulenc, France's flagship chemicals company which was recently
confirmed as one of the first candidates for privatisation, saw sales fall
by 6 per cent to FFr40.03bn (Dollars 6.8bn) in the first six months of 1993,
from FFr42.56bn in the same period of 1992.
Suez, the holding company with extensive interests across industry and
finance which was privatised in the mid-1980s, reported a 1 per cent decline
in interim turnover to FFr89.86bn this year from FFr90.51bn last year.
Michelin, the tyre maker struggling to rationalise in response to the
slowdown in the international motor industry, suffered a more dramatic fall
in sales, down 12 per cent to FFr30.61bn from FFr34.8bn over the same
period.
Bouygues and Lafarge Coppee, two of France's leading construction companies,
were also hit by sales declines. Bouygues, the building group, saw sales
fall by 6 per cent to FFr28.1bn in the first half from FFr30.03bn in the
same period of 1992, while Lafarge Coppee, the building materials group, saw
a 5 per cent reduction in interim turnover to FFr14.28bn from FFr15.06bn.
A few large companies have managed to buck the downward trend. The L'Oreal
cosmetics group saw sales rise by 7 per cent to FFr20.89bn in the first half
of this year from FFr19.5bn last time. Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the utility
and construction company, kept interim sales growth just above inflation
with an increase of 4 per cent to FFr45.64bn from FFr43.86bn.
