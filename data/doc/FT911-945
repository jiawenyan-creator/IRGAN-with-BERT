FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: CAIL worth at least ADollars
595m, says report
COAL and Allied Industries (CAIL), the Australian group which is the target
of a ADollars 437m hostile bid by CRA, is worth at least ADollars 595m
(USDollars 464m), according to a report released yesterday.
The report, by Grant Samuel and Associates, says CAIL shares are worth
between ADollars 10.70 and ADollars 11.20, valuing the company at between
ADollars 595m and ADollars 623m. CRA, which is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of
the UK, has refused to increase its offer of ADollars 7.85 per share.
Grant Samuel's report, commissioned by CAIL, says the CRA offer does not
reflect the strategic value of acquiring the low cost mines operated by
CAIL, which is Australia's second largest coal producer.
The report says CAIL's significant coal reserves 'could support incremental
expansion of production (by CRA) at a much lower capital cost than would be
required by new projects'.
The acquisition of CAIL would also increase CRA's ability to influence the
market and reduce competition between Australian exporters, it says.
Mr Neil Currie, CAIL chairman, told shareholders that the board continued to
regard CRA's offer as 'inadequate and unacceptable'.
CAIL shares closed 12 cents lower on the Australian Stock Exchange
yesterday, at ADollars 8.44.
