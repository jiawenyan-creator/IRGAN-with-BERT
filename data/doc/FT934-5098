FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Sick pay changes - Employment Benefits
Making large companies meet the full cost of the sick pay of their employees
will cut government spending by Pounds 700m a year, said the chancellor.
Under his proposals companies with national insurance bills totalling less
than Pounds 20,000 will be fully reimbursed after four weeks.
This is a relaxation of the system under which companies with national
insurance bills of less than Pounds 16,000 a year are fully reimbursed after
the first six weeks of each sick pay claim.
'This means for well-managed companies with low sickness rates there will be
a net reduction in the cost of employing people,' he claimed.
The chancellor also said that from next April national insurance
contributions are to be cut by 1.0 per cent for any long-term unemployed
looking for unskilled or semi-skilled low paid work.
Overall the chancellor calculates that the cuts in national insurance
contriubutions will reduce the overall cost to employers of job provision by
Pounds 830m next year rising to Pounds 1bn by 1996-97.
This he said was 'well above the overall cost to employers of the reform to
statutory sick pay'.
