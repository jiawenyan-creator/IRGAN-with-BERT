 

The RP/EIS will also include other elements and address other concerns as needed to complete a fully responsive NEPA
and SEPA document. The format recommended by CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1502.10 

et seq.

 and SEPA Rules (WAC 19711430) will be followed as appropriate.



Cooperating Agencies



Several agencies have been identified as cooperating agencies. They are: The Puyallup Tribe of Indians, the Muckleshoot
Indian Tribe, the Washington Department of Ecology, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Environmental Protection
Agency. The Seattle District Corps of Engineers has been designated by the lead agencies as the primary agent for preparing
the RP/EIS.



Study Area



The study area for the RP/EIS includes Commencement Bay (that portion of Puget Sound enclosed within a line extending
from Brown's Point to Point Defiance); the watershed of Commencement Bay and its main tributaries (the Puyallup/Carbon
River, the White River, Hylebos Creek, Wapato Creek, Puget Creek); and Puget Sound coastal areas adjacent to Commencement
Bay (southern Vashon and Maury Islands, Dumas Bay). Within the study area, the RP/EIS will focus on those areas that
serve as habitat for or otherwise support the natural resources of Commencement Bay potentially injured as a result
of releases of CERCLA hazardous substances and discharges of oil.



Request for Comments



Your views as to the scope and content of the environmental information needed for the RP/EIS are important to the preparation
of the study report. To be most helpful, the scoping comments should clearly describe specific environmental issues
or topics which the commenter believes the document should address. This Notice of Intent will be mailed to Federal,
state, and local agencies, organizations, groups and individuals identified during the CB/NRDA process.

Scoping meetings will be scheduled to provide the public with an opportunity to engage in discussions regarding the
RP/EIS. The times and locations of the scoping meetings will be announced at a later date. Notices will be sent to all
agencies, organizations, and individuals on the RP/EIS mailing list.

The lead agencies expect to complete preparation of the draft RP/EIS and have review copies of it available by March
1995.
