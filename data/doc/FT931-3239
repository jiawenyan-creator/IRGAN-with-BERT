FT  17 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Investors spend a day on the sidelines
THERE were few new issues in the international bond market yesterday as
investors retreated to the sidelines ahead of the UK budget and the
Bundesbank's council meeting tomorrow.
The African Development Bank is expected to launch a Dollars 500m Eurobond
issue in the next few days, via Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers.
Otherwise, syndicate managers said that it was unlikely that there would be
many more new issues this week.
Two foreign borrowers, the Bank for Dutch Municipalities, and SNCF, the
French railway, tapped the Swiss franc market for SFr150m and SFr300m
respectively.
Both issues have a maturity of eight years, which syndicate managers said
suited the requirements of the borrowers and met demand from investors for
paper in a relatively neglected area of the Swiss yield curve.
They noted that most of the recent Swiss franc issues had been either in the
five-year or 10-year area, but that there had not been much in between. Both
issues were trading within fees in mid-afternoon.
Meanwhile, KfW International Finance's DM1.5bn 10-year Eurobond issue,
launched on Monday, was priced at 99.30 to yield 15 basis points over the 7
1/8 per cent bund due December 2003, in the middle of the indicated range of
14 to 16 basis points.
The spread was broadly unchanged when the bonds were freed to trade.
But, as the market had expected, the yield spread on Denmark's
aggressively-priced five-year Eurobond issue widened to around 15 basis
points over the series 105 of medium-term German government bonds from 10
basis points at the launch on Monday.
