FT  03 NOV 93 / Anglo-Irish meeting may founder on nationalism
WHEN Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister arrives in Belfast today for
the Anglo-Irish governmental meeting, he can be confident that, having
sidelined the Hume-Adams peace initiative, any new initiative worked out
with the British will not bear the hallmarks of Sinn Fein.
But Dublin's attempts to uphold parts of the nationalist agenda leave
substantial obstacles.
The Irish government's six-point plan says: 'The people living in Ireland,
north and south, without coercion, without violence, should be free to
determine their own future.' But confusion has arisen over how this fits
with Mr Spring's statement last week that Dublin accepts the principle of a
unionist veto over constitutional change in the north.
The Irish foreign ministry said that 'majority consent' and 'unionist
consent' should be considered together.
Another question arises over the means by which the Irish may satisfy
unionist demands over their claim to sovereignty of the north. The Irish
constitution can only be amended by referendum. Dublin's objective, admitted
by the government, is that any new agreement on governing structures should
be approved by a referendum in the north, while a simultaneous referendum in
the Republic would both amend the Irish constitution and approve the
agreement reached in the north.
Simultaneous referenda are a key element in the Hume-Adams peace initiative,
and acceptance of them is thought to be the signal Sinn Fein is looking for
as the minimum condition for the IRA ending its violence.
