  [Text] Shenzhen, February 21 (XINHUA) -- An intellectual 
property rights division of Shenzhen intermediate people's court 
has recently been set up here. 
  The government of Shenzhen, one of the country's five 
special 
economic zones, has in recent years brought in a series of 
reform measures in the field of intellectual property rights. 
  The pioneering auction of new technologies and inventions 
has 
effectively promoted the application of technological and 
scientific achievements to production. 
  More and more local enterprises have stipulated that holders 
of new technology or inventors of new products can become 
shareholders of the enterprises in return. 
  However, the economic boom has also given rise to disputes 
involving intellectual property rights. 
  Shenzhen intermediate people's court handled 18 cases last 
year involving intellectual property rights. Disputes about 
industrial property rights and patent rights of foreign trade 
marks accounted for the majority. 
  The newly-founded court will strengthen protection of 
intellectual property rights more effectively, according to the 
president of Shenzhen intermediate people's court.
