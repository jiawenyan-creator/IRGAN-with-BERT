FT  05 NOV 92 / Observer: A sip in time
Segrave Foulkes must be crossing its wine-stained fingers that the new owner
of Chateau Latour cares about both history and the English language.
The specialist publishers have been commissioned to produce an English
version of the uniquely detailed archival history - running to two dense
volumes in French - of this great estate. A snip at Pounds 140, the work was
due out in Britain this Christmas but, fortuitously, publication has been
postponed until April.
So there is time to insert a short chapter about the latest transfer of
what, in more indulgent days, was described as the jewel in Allied-Lyons'
crown, doubtless into the hands of another multinational corporation. Let's
hope it's not McDonald's.
