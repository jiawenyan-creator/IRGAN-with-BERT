  [Text] The police today announced the arrest of Chief 
Moshood Abiola. The police public relations officer at the 
(?corps) headquarters said the arrest was effected at his Ikeja 
residence last night when he resurfaced from his hideout. The 
police had earlier this month declared Chief Abiola wanted and 
called for information that could lead to his arrest. 
  The police also said that the activities of Chief Abiola and 
his group transcended the quest for the actualization of the 12 
June phenomenon. It said the activities included well-laid down 
plans to cause a breakdown of law and order as well as the 
forceful overthrow of the Federal Military Government. 
  In a fresh statement today, the police expressed 
appreciation 
to the entire public for the cooperation they received during 
the search for Abiola and assured that the entire activities of 
Chief Abiola from 12 June last year to date were under thorough 
investigation and advised members of the public to go about 
their normal businesses and report suspicious elements to the 
police.
