 

General Information 


The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan; 
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.
