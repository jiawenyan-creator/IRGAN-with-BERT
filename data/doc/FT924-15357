FT  05 OCT 92 / Sterling to dominate markets
THE FORTUNES of sterling will this week dominate UK financial markets where
confidence that UK base rates can be reduced to 8 per cent by the year-end
has been badly shaken by the renewed weakness of the pound.
Predictions from many City analysts that base rates might be cut by a
further one point from their present 9 per cent level to coincide with the
Conservative party conference were effectively withdrawn on Friday afternoon
when the pound appeared close to free fall.
The Bundesbank's decision that day to leave German rates unchanged is likely
to keep sterling under pressure.
The expected political tensions at the conference will also increase
uncertainty in a stock market still seeking clarification of the
government's economic strategy after sterling's departure from the exchange
rate mechanism.
The retail price index for August, due on Friday, is expected to show a
continued moderation in inflationary pressures, according to Brian Hilliard
at stockbroker Strauss Turnbull.
The dollar opened in Tokyo this morning at a historic low of Y118.93.
