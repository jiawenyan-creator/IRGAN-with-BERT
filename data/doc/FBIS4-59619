<F P=106> [Interview with Yosi Katz, Israeli Labor Party Deputy, by </F>
Erhard Stackl in Vienna; date not given: "Palestinian State 
Possible Only Without Terrorism"] 
  [Text] Unofficial talks were held at the weekend between 
Israelis and Palestinians at the Vienna Kreisky Forum. DER 
STANDARD's Erhard Stackl talked to the organizer of the meeting, 
Yossi Katz, the Israeli Labor Party's deputy parliamentary group 
chairman. 
  [Stackl] You have negotiated with the PLO in Bruno Kreisky's 
house, whose demand for a dialogue with the Palestinians used to 
be criticized very sharply by the Israeli Labor Party. Is this 
a political rehabilitation for Kreisky? 
  [Katz] The answer might be yes in political terms. Yet, I 
am one of the people who have advocated contacts with the PLO 
for a long time. But a lot has changed, including the 
Palestinians. They have acknowledged Israel's right to 
existence, and Israel has accepted that the PLO represents the 
Palestinian people. 
  [Stackl] Are you in favor of an independent Palestinian 
state? 
  [Katz] It would be better for Israel, if the Palestinians 
had such a perspective. It would be in their own interests then 
to preserve peace and prevent terrorism. 
  [Stackl] Prime Minister Rabin is against it. 
  [Katz] But 74 percent of all Israelis think that there will 
be a Palestinian state -- without necessarily wanting it. 
  [Stackl] What is to become of the Jewish settlers? 
  [Katz] The settlements that are next to Palestinian 
residential areas are a problem. But at least 70 percent of the 
settlers are not fanatics; they only went to those territories 
to improve their personal circumstances. They are prepared to 
go back behind the Green Line (the pre-1967 border), if they are 
given land or an apartment here as an alternative. I have 
drafted a bill that is to offer such compensation to returning 
settlers. 
  I have also discussed this proposal with settlers. A few 
lunatics called my wife and told her that she will be a widow 
soon. But I think that settlers with ideological motives can 
also be convinced and a new Zionist movement can be established 
to promote settlements in the north and south of Israel. 
  [Stackl] What are the greatest dangers to the peace process? 
  [Katz] There are many obstacles, such as terrorism. But I 
think that the Palestinian police force will be able to cope 
with this danger together with the Israeli security forces. I 
can imagine more than half of (the extreme Islamistic movement) 
Hamas taking part in political life. But there may also be a 
civil war among the Palestinians -- this will be a test for 
them. Only if they prevent terrorism will they stand a chance 
of having a state. The bad economic situation is also a problem. 
  But there are also obstacles on our side. That is why we 
have talked about a permanent solution here. No one sent us to 
Vienna, but we will report to the prime minister and the foreign 
minister. 
  [Stackl] Are there not big differences on the issue of 
Palestinian refugees returning to Israel? 
  [Katz] The gap is not all that wide. The Palestinian 
refugees want their rights to be acknowledged and they want to 
get compensation. But they know that it will be impossible for 
them to return to Haifa or Jaffa. 
  [Stackl] Is Israel prepared to give up the Golan? 
  [Katz] The Golan Heights are important -- in times of war. 
But in times of peace, and when there are comprehensive 
economic, but also political relations with Syria, they are not 
needed. 
  [Stackl] Do you think there is a willingness to talk in 
Damascus? 
  [Katz] Yes, I think so. Some of my colleagues who have 
visited Syria recently say that al-Asad has also changed. There 
is a chance.
