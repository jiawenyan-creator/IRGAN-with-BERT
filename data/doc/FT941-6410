FT  02 MAR 94 / Cost probe on nursery teaching
Mr John Major, the prime minister, has ordered an inquiry into the cost
implications of introducing nursery provision for all children under the age
of five.
Mr Eric Forth, junior education minister, told the Commons last night that
whether or not attendance should be mandatory or optional, and whether the
teachers involved should be graduates were among issues being considered.
He suggested that the cost of making the fullest possible provision would be
in the region of Pounds 1bn a year.
