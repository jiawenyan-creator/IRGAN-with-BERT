FT  08 SEP 94 / Observer: Stamp it out
No wonder the Royal Bank of Scotland had such a ready translation for that
disturbing business about retrocessing, reponing and restoring that Observer
ran across in a Bank of Scotland letter. Why, the RBS itself is no slouch
when it comes to obfuscation. Take its securities division, which instructs
a customer to forward his dividend mandate form to his own bank, whereupon
'they will verify the details by adhibiting their branch stamp . . .'.
Naturally.
