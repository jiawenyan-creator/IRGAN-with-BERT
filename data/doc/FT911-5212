FT  16 APR 91 / World Trade News: Toyota may sell VWs in Japan
TOYOTA is negotiating to sell Volkswagen vehicles in Japan in expectation of
strong demand for imported models.
The negotiations come as EC representatives consider import levels for
Japanese cars after 1992, and despite a fall in sales of imported vehicles
in Japan this year, after seven years of rising sales.
Foreign makers claim the Japanese market remains partly closed, while
Japanese car makers want to prove that it is open and that they dominate
sales on merit. Imported vehicles comprised about 4 per cent of Japan's car
and truck market last year.
Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, the president of Toyota, said the company had been
considering a number of possibilities regarding imported vehicles, including
an agreement with Volkswagen. However, he said nothing had been decided.
Volkswagen and Audi have been among most successful of exporters to Japan,
but their sales have also declined this year. In March they sold 6,105
vehicles, down from 7,264 in March last year, while sales of imported cars
last month totalled 21,892 units, down from 25,727 a year earlier.
Toyota said the extent of the sales link-up would depend on the willingness
of Toyota dealers in Japan to handle foreign cars and that would be
determined by their expectations of sales.
