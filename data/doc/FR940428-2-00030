Cascade Power Co., Notice of Availability of Final Environmental Assessment


April 21, 1994.


In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 F.R. 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has
reviewed the application for a subsequent minor license for the existing Cascade Project, located on the Little River
in Transylvania County, North Carolina, near the city of Brevard, and has prepared a final Environmental Assessment
(EA) for the project. In the EA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental
impacts of the project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective
or enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of
the human environment.
Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426.
