MAPPLETHORPE IMAGES 
Mapplethorpe's life as a sexual individual and his attraction to our revolving 
identities is enough to create more than just a "small cult following." 
Yes, Mr. Wilson, he dangled the dramatics of sexual deviation in front of us. 
And such leather-bound deviation is rife with varied interpretation. But 
homosexuality and sexual experimentation are no rare experiences, and those of 
us who are flagrantly and proudly gay support any and all expressions of open 
individuality -- or social deviance. 
Wilson tries to define human diversity as segregated "special interest groups." 
But the empathy he is seeking in Mapplethorpe's work is evident in 
reproductions of the human face, the human form. 
What I am shocked at is the great deal of fear in Wilson's review, much akin to 
the hysteria surrounding this exhibit. The fear that, without constraints, 
freedom can be a dangerous thing. 
But I respect the strength of the individual to interpret the questions that 
Mapplethorpe's images arouse in such a way as to solidify a life-embracing 
morality and to lighten the seriousness with which man confronts his own fears, 
sexuality, role playing and death.
