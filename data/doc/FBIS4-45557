  [Excerpt] The Constituent Congress plenum on 15 June 
insisted on its original draft bill that punishes those involved 
in poppy growing with up to 15 years of imprisonment, thus 
minimizing the executive branch proposal for reduced punishment 
for those who own up to one kilogram of poppy seeds. 
  The bill states that those who engage in growing, promoting, 
helping, or financing garden poppy will be punished with 
imprisonment terms no shorter than eight years and no longer 
than 15 years. It adds that if someone is captured with a 
maximum of 100 poppy plants, he will be sentenced to prison for 
no less than two years and no more than eight years. 
  In an effort to justify the bill, Congressman Carlos Ferrero 
Costa (C 90-NM) [Change 90-New Majority] said these details are 
necessary because "one kilogram of garden poppy seeds can 
produce up to 38 kg of poppy." 
  The draft bill adds that those people who are facing trial 
or 
already have been sentenced for this crime will not be granted 
any freedom on bail, parole, probation, redemption of the 
sentence by work or education, remission of the sentence, or 
pardon. 
  Since Congress insisted on its original proposal, the draft 
bill must be promulgated by the Congress president to be 
implemented. [passage omitted]
