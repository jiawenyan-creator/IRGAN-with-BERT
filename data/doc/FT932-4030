FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cabinet discusses dockyards' future
MR JOHN MAJOR chaired a cabinet committee yesterday on the future of Rosyth
and Devonport dockyards. But the prime minister's office said the prime
minister wanted to talk widely among backbench MPs before reaching a
decision on the award of a vital contract to refit nuclear submarines.
Officials said a lot more work was needed on the costs of the two dockyards
bids before an announcement could be made. The government is also understood
to be looking at ways of softening the impact on jobs for the dockyard that
fails to win.
