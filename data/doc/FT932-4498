FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Crossrail bill ready to proceed
THE CROSSRAIL bill clearing the way for a Pounds 2bn project to build two
rail tunnels under central London was last night set to receive its
long-awaited Commons second reading.
Prime minister John Major last month bowed to mounting pressure to underline
the government's commitment to the scheme, while emphasising it was
determined to ensure it was carried out as cost effectively as possible.
