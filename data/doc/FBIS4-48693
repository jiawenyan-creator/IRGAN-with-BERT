  [Excerpt] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] advisers 
to Maputo Province today accused the provincial government of 
hindering the reintegration of areas under Renamo control in 
state administration. Speaking at a news conference, the 
advisers said they had submitted a working program to the 
provincial governor, promising to conclude the reintegration 
process by the end of this month. They said the program will 
not be fulfilled in time however because the provincial 
government does not provide transportation to carry out work in 
areas under Renamo control. They also spoke about the problems 
of housing, lack of direct telephone lines, and transportation 
from house to work and vice versa. [passage omitted]
