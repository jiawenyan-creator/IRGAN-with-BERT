THURGOOD MARSHALL 
Justice Thurgood Marshall's remarks regarding U.S. Supreme Court nominee Judge 
David Souter and President Bush only served to demean the Supreme Court and 
raise serious questions about Marshall's continued presence on the court 
("Somebody's Calling Bush's Shots, Marshall Says," Part A, July 27). 
It is apparent that Justice Marshall is unable to remain and unbiased jurist 
and sit in judgment on the important cases that come before the court. It might 
be wise for the Senate Judiciary Committee to conduct hearings to determine 
whether Justice Marshall should be subject to impeachment for his conduct, 
after completing its confirmation hearings on Judge Souter.
