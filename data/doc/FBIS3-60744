  [Text] Vilnius, Dec 20, ELTA -- Leaders of Ignalina nuclear 
power plant and German company ``GNB'' signed a contract on the 
supply of 60 containers to store nuclear fuel used in RBMK-1500 
type reactors, director-general of Ignalina plant Viktor 
Shevaldin told ELTA on Monday [20 December]. 
  The containers will be made in Germany and brought to 
Lithuania a year after the signing of the contract. They will be 
sent in separate cargoes within 15 months. Shevaldin said the 
containers belong to the famous ``Castor'' group whose 
production corresponds with strict technological standards. They 
are very safe and used in the world for 20 years. Such 
containers are used in Finland, France, Germany, Britain, 
Russia, Switzerland, U.S.A., Sweden, etc. 
  ``GNB'' is a specialized company producing containers for 
storage of used nuclear fuel. 
  Shevaldin also said the international competition to arrange 
a project of a storage was won by a Swedish company ``SKB.'' The 
company is solving questions of storage of nuclear fuel and 
nuclear waste. He said it would be the first dry interim storage 
of a nuclear fuel used in RBMK-type reactors.
