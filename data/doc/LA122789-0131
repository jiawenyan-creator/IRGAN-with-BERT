DRIVER OF MARTIN PICKUP LEGALLY DRUNK, TEST SHOWS 
A blood alcohol test on the man blamed for the traffic accident in which former 
New York Yankee Manager Billy Martin died shows he was intoxicated according to 
legal definition, a prosecutor said today. 
Kevin Guyette, who prosecutes felony drunk driving cases in the Broome County 
district attorney's office, said the test on William Reedy supports the charge 
that Reedy was drunk Christmas evening when he drove Martin's pickup truck off 
the road near Martin's rural home. 
Guyette refused to say what Reedy's blood-alcohol level was, but he said Reedy 
was charged under the state law that says a person is intoxicated when his 
blood-alcohol level is at least 0.1%. 
Conviction on the misdemeanor charge carries a maximum penalty of a year in 
jail and a $1,000 fine. Reedy, who remained in fair condition today at 
University Hospital in Syracuse, faces arraignment Jan. 4. 
Jon S. Blechman, Reedy's Binghamton lawyer, was not in his office and could not 
be reached for comment, his secretary said. 
The 53-year-old Reedy, of Detroit, told a sheriff's deputy that he and Martin, 
61, had been out shopping and had stopped for a drink at a Binghamton bar, 
whose name he did not know, before the accident. 
Broome County Sheriff Anthony Ruffo said his investigators had not discovered 
which bar it was but said it would not have much bearing on the case. 
State records in Michigan showed that Reedy was convicted in 1987 of driving 
while impaired after police in Dearborn, a Detroit suburb, reported his 
blood-alcohol level at more than 0.07%. 
His license was restricted for three months and he was ordered to attend 
outpatient alcohol treatment classes, said Denise Yockey, spokeswoman for the 
Michigan Secretary of State's office. 
Reedy, owner of Reedy's Saloon near Detroit's Tiger Stadium, also had five 
driving infractions in Michigan, including careless driving, making an improper 
turn and speeding.
