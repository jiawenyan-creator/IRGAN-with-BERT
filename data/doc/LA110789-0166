GILBERT SCORES NEAR-SWEEP AS TOURNEY OPENS 
Third-seeded Brad Gilbert of the United States crushed Pieter Aldrich 6-0, 6-1 
in the first round of a men's tennis tournament today, coming within one point 
of blanking the South African. 
"I've never been close to that situation before, being within a point for 6-0, 
6-0," Gilbert said. "But I was striking the ball pretty good. I did everything 
well today -- I wish I could play like that all the time." 
Gilbert was the highest-ranked player in action on the opening day of the 
$440,000 men's tournament at Wembley Arena. Fourth-seeded Jimmy Connors was 
scheduled to wrap up the evening session against Alexander Volkov of the Soviet 
Union. 
In other opening-day matches, Wally Masur of Australia beat Kelly Evernden of 
New Zealand 6-1, 6-2; Amos Mansdorf of Israel beat Christian Saceanu of West 
Germany 6-3, 6-3; Guy Forget of France beat John Fitzgerald of Australia 6-3, 
6-2; Michael Stich of West Germany beat American Ken Flach 6-4, 6-7, 6-3; and 
Flach's longtime doubles partner, Robert Seguso, beat Andrew Castle of Britain 
6-1, 6-4. 
Top seed John McEnroe and second-seeded Michael Chang play their first-round 
matches Wednesday. 
Gilbert, who won four tournaments in a row last summer and has boosted his 
world ranking to No. 4, toyed with Aldrich in a 46-minute match. 
The American lost just six points in the first five games and a total of 26 in 
the match. 
Seguso came back from a 3-0 deficit in the second set to wrap up his victory 
over Castle in 53 minutes, winning the last three games.
