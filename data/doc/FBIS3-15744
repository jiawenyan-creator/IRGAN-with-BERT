  [Text] Moscow, 9 Mar -- "For the first time in three or 
four decades, Russia will not import grain, linen or wool this 
year." This was stated to journalists by Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin following the wreath-laying ceremony at Yuriy Gagarin's 
tomb at the Kremlin Wall. 
  Boris Yeltsin noted that "we have enough grain to last us 
until the new harvest." He also emphasized that whereas three 
years ago "we talked about famine, today we are saying that food 
will be fully provided." 
  The Russian president also said that currently "we are 
interested in achieving variety and quality to match foreign 
standards, as well as in tackling the issue of prices." "This is 
what we will be working on," the president stressed.
