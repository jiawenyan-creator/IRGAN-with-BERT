B. Surveillance



1. Establish mechanism(s) to provide clinicians with appropriate laboratory tests for the diagnosis of Legionnaires'
disease.

CATEGORY IA



2. Conduct active search for cases of nosocomial Legionnaires' disease, especially in patients who are at high-risk
of acquiring the disease (patients who are immunosuppressed, including organ-transplant patients, patients with
AIDS, and patients receiving systemic steroids; are "65 years of age; or have chronic underlying disease such as diabetes
mellitus, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive lung disease).

A. Primary Prevention (Preventing Nosocomial Legionnaires' Disease When No Cases Have Been Documented)



1. Nebulization and Other Devices



a. Use only sterile (not distilled, nonsterile) water for rinsing nebulization devices and other respiratory-care
equipment after they have been cleaned and/or disinfected.

CATEGORY IB



b. Use only sterile (not distilled, nonsterile) water to fill reservoirs of devices used for nebulization.

c. Do not use large-volume room-air humidifiers that create aerosols (e.g., by venturi principle, ultrasound, or
spinning disk) and thus are really nebulizers, unless they can be sterilized or subjected to high-level disinfection
daily and filled only with sterile water.

2. Cooling Towers



a. When a new hospital building is constructed, place cooling tower(s) in such a way that the tower drift is directed
away from the hospital's air-intake system, and design the cooling towers such that the volume of aerosol drift is
minimized.

b. For operational cooling towers, install drift eliminators, regularly use an effective biocide, maintain the
tower according to manufacturers' recommendations, and keep adequate maintenance records.

B. Secondary Prevention (Response to Identification of Laboratory-Confirmed Nosocomial Legionellosis)



When a single case of laboratory-confirmed, definite nosocomial Legionnaires' disease is identified, OR if two
or more cases of laboratory-confirmed, possible nosocomial Legionnaires' disease occur within 6 months of each
other (Refer to background document for definition of definite and possible nosocomial Legionnaires' disease.):

1. Contact the local or state health department or the CDC for consultation.



CATEGORY IB



2. If a case is identified in a severely immunocompromised patient such as an organ-transplant recipient, OR if the
hospital houses severely immunocompromised patients, conduct a combined epidemiologic and environmental investigation
(as outlined from IIB3b1 through IIB5, below) to determine the source(s)
of 

Legionella

 sp.



CATEGORY IB



3. If the hospital does not house severely immunocompromised patients, conduct an epidemiologic investigation
via a retrospective review of microbiologic, serologic, and postmortem data, and an intensive prospective surveillance
for additional cases of nosocomial Legionnaires' disease.
