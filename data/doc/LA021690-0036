A PILL FOR SLEEPING 
Question: I was on a cruise with some friends, and one evening a member of our 
group said he was going to take a sleeping pill and turn in. This surprised me, 
because it was as if he was saying that he was going to brush his teeth and 
turn in. 
Should sleeping pills be used so casually? I sometimes have trouble falling 
asleep, but I've never used pills to help me do so. Should more of us be using 
pills for this purpose? 
Answer: I don't know why your friend was relying on pills to fall asleep; 
possibly there was some sound medical reason for him to do so. In general, 
however, people who only occasionally experience difficulty in sleeping should 
not resort to the use of medication. 
If lack of sleep is impairing an individual's ability to function normally, 
then the use of pills for a few days may be indicated. Of course, 
sleep-inducing pills may also be prescribed for patients who are experiencing 
difficulty in sleeping because of illness or recent surgery.
