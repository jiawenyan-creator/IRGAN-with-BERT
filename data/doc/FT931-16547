FT  06 JAN 93 / Letter: Abolish housing subsidy
Sir, I read with amazement recent government proposals to encourage the
private rented housing sector. That the rented sector needs encouragement is
all too clear. But a government which still claims to believe in free
markets is in effect now considering the introduction of a serious market
distortion to compensate for another - involving moreover the spending of
billions of pounds.
The private rented sector has been crowded out largely by the need for
private landlords to charge high rents. This results from the inflation of
house prices and the need to set rents which will provide an adequate return
on capital.
The fall in house prices is therefore to be welcomed, but to ensure a
permanently lower level of house prices and to remove the distortion in
favour of owner-occupation, the government should abolish mortgage interest
tax relief.
This subsidy can be abolished with immediate effect for everyone who took
out their mortgage before Black Wednesday, as the reduction in interest
rates since then more than offsets the removal of this subsidy in most
cases.
The resulting long-term reduction in house prices would be good news too for
private buyers and providers of housing for social renting. If funds are
available I suggest a means-tested but generous housing benefit available to
both renters and buyers.
