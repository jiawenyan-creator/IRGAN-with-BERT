FT  27 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Reuters
Reuters' successful share buy-back is less astonishing when one considers
the tax advantage to UK pension funds whose receipts are gross of income
tax. Since the accompanying tax credit effectively gives them Pounds 17.20 a
share, it was worth selling to the company at Pounds 14 even though the
market price was around Pounds 15. The question is whether the lucky winners
will use the proceeds to replenish their holdings of Reuters or spread them
liberally round the rest of the market.
