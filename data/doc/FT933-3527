FT  14 SEP 93 / Airline launches discounts
Northwest Airlines yesterday prompted another round of discounting among US
carriers, undermining a tentative effort by some airlines last week to push
through modest fare rises this autumn, writes Richard Waters from New York.
Its discounts of 35-45 per cent on all domestic routes were promptly matched
by TWA.
