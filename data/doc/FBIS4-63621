  [Text] According to a decree on complex measures to ensure 
prompt and entire collection of taxes and duties signed by 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin Monday, all taxpayers will have 
to register in the State Taxation Service. The decree 
stipulates that taxpayers may open accounts with banks only if 
they have been properly registered. 
  If an enterprise violates the procedure, it will be 
administratively imposed a fine of one hundred minimum salaries. 
At the moment, the minimum salary in Russia is 14,700 rubles. 
  In case of a repeated violation, the taxation service 
reports 
it to the Central Bank of Russia. The tax evader will be 
abolished and its incomes confiscated by the treasury. 
  According to the decree, a taxpayer may have one current and 
one budget accounts with a bank for his operations within the 
scope of his activities. 
  Taxpayers must submit information on their open accounts, 
including hard currency, loans, deposits both in Russia and 
abroad. 
  The decree came into force once signed.
