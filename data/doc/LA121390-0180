SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MISSING LOOT INVESTIGATION 
The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department is investigating the disappearance of 
$14,000 from a safe in the Glendora Police Department last month. 
City Manager Art Cook said he called in the Sheriff's Department to investigate 
the apparent theft of the money, which was being held as evidence. He said it 
was part of the loot retrieved after a robbery of the Foothill Employees 
Federal Credit Union on Foothill Boulevard. Cook said the money was found to be 
missing from the Police Department in early November. 
The Glendora City Council on Tuesday voted unanimously to reimburse the credit 
union for its loss.
