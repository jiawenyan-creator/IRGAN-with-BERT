special aid Shusei Tanaka's 25 January remark; from "NHK News" 
program] 
  [Text] On the evening of 25 January, the prime minister's 
special aide, Shusei Tanaka, said Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa might resign if the Diet fails to enact the political 
reform bills. Commenting on this, Prime Minister Hosokawa told 
reporters this morning that he does not have any such intention. 
  On the issue, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
said 
at a news conference today: 
  When the prime minister takes responsibility, clear actions 
are either to dissolve the lower house or to resign en masse. 
Of these, Mr. Tanaka probably thought the cabinet's resignation 
is more likely. I personally have no opinion on that.
