  [Text] The Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] 
welcomes the recent decision of the Western European Union [WEU] 
Council of Ministers to grant Romania the status of WEU 
associate partner -- a faxed communique signed by PDSR Executive 
President Adrian Nastase states today. The communique points 
out that, thanks to this decision, the Romanian Government has 
taken yet another step along the road to the country's 
integration into European structures. 
  Romania's admission to the WEU's political and military 
structures, the communique reads, proves that Western Europe has 
adopted a nondiscriminatory approach and is promoting a 
significant opening toward the countries in this part of the 
continent. 
  In conclusion, the PDSR wants to reiterate once more that 
Romania's full integration into European and Euro-Atlantic 
structures is a priority goal and that not only Romania's 
security but also the success of the transition process toward 
the social market economy, the establishment of the rule of law, 
and the country's socioeconomic progress depend on achieving 
this goal.
