  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 19 April TASS -- Leader of the 
unrecognised Gagauz Republic Stepan Topal believes that "every 
condition for the political settlement of the Gagauz problem has 
been created in Moldova." He told this on Tuesday to ITAR-TASS 
on a basis of the results of the Monday meeting with Moldovan 
President Mircea Snegur with whom problems of settlement of the 
Gagauz problems were, specifically, discussed. 
  Topal said Snegur had shortly promissed to submit to the 
Moldovan parliament a draft law on granting a special status to 
districts predominantly peopled by Gagauz. "We have proposed a 
draft law on creating the autonomous region Gagauzeri, which 
largely coincides with Kishinev's proposals and does not run 
counter to the principles of preserving Moldova's territorial 
intergity," Topal said. "Their essence is to grant broad powers 
to local government bodies." 
  It is of essential importance for Gagauz that the draft 
keeps 
the provision of the right of the Gagauz people to 
self-determination in case Moldova's political status changes, 
Topal said. "Gagauz wish to have basic guarantees that Moldova 
keeps on independence track and that we shall not wake up in a 
different country one fine morning," Topal said.
