FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: BioChem halves losses in first
quarter to CDollars 2.5m
BIOCHEM Pharma, an associate in anti-Aids drugs development of Glaxo of the
UK, reports a first-quarter loss of CDollars 2.5m (USDollars 1.95m) after
special items, against a loss of CDollars 5m a year earlier. Revenues fell
to CDollars 8.6m from CDollars 9.7m.
BioChem, which was set up six years ago, is a research company primarily and
does not expect revenues from its diagnostics and vaccine businesses to
outweigh heavy research spending for another year or two.
Glaxo holds an 18 per cent interest in BioChem and is contributing around
CDollars 200m for the development of BioChem's 3TC anti-Aids drug now in
final clinical tests.
MDS Health, a supplier of medical testing services and distributor of
medical supplies and equipment, reports net profit of CDollars 7.8m for the
second quarter ended April, up from CDollars 6.49m a year earlier. Sales
were CDollars 166m against CDollars 110m.
