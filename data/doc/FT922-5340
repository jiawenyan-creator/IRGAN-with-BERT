FT  01 JUN 92 / Construction Contracts: Building ferry terminal at Hull
The Fairclough Civil Eng ineering specialist, FAIRCLOUGH MARINE, has been
awarded a design and construct contract worth almost Pounds 11m by
Associated British Ports for a roll-on/roll-off ferry terminal at Hull.
The 13-month contract will include the construction of a jetty, a
hydraulically operated shore ramp, berthing dolphins, protection dolphins, a
traffic underpass, roadworks, a container handling area and a large car
parking area of 12.3 acres.
Due to start on site in July, Fairclough Marine anticipates completion in
August 1993. Being constructed on behalf of North Sea Ferries, the roll-
on/roll-off facility is being designed for the new 23,000 tonne
'superfreighter' ferries which are to be introduced.
Fairclough Civil Engineering has also been selected to construct the A27
Westhampnett bypass near Chichester, West Sussex, for the Department of
Transport under a contract valued at almost Pounds 7m.
Scheduled for completion in the spring of 1993, Fairclough's contract
comprises a two mile dual two-lane carriageway bypassing the village of
Westhampnett. The project also includes alterations to local roads affected
by the bypass.
Fairclough Civil Engineering is part of AMEC, the international
construction, engineering and development group.
