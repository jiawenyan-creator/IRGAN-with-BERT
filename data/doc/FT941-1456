FT  25 MAR 94 / Japanese workers agree to low rises
Leading Japanese labour unions representing steel, shipbuilding and car
workers yesterday agreed to the lowest wage increases seen since 1987 in one
of the most fractious spring wage offensives in recent years.
The Japanese Electrical, Electronic and Information Union, representing
workers at groups such as Matsushita and Toshiba, warned of industrial
action after management refused to better a 3 per cent wage offer for the
year beginning April. The union is seeking a 3.2 per cent rise, lower than
last year's 3.6 per cent.
Private railway workers were late yesterday poised to go on a 24-hour strike
beginning this morning. The railway unions are sticking to their demand of a
Y12,000 (Pounds 76) a month increase, against an offer of Y10,000.
The pay increases agreed yesterday by the steel, shipbuilding and car
industries were among the lowest since the spring wage offensive, known as
Shunto, was first launched 40 years ago.
The round coincides with the fourth year of decline in the Japanese economy
and a call by business organisations for a general pay freeze.
Yesterday's agreements will set the tone for wage talks in other sectors,
giving rise to concerns that the low agreements will put a further dampener
on consumer sentiment. Steel workers settled for a 1.56 per cent increase,
significantly lower than the 2.65 per cent won last year.
In the car sector, Toyota settled for 3.06 per cent, against a 3.2 per cent
demand. Honda set its offer at Y300 below Toyota's; Nissan offered Y800
below Toyota. Shipbuilding and heavy industry workers won a 3.32 per cent
increase (4.27 per cent in 1993).
