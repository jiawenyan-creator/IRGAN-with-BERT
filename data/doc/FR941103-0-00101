ratings between 25 and 35 psig, this formula will rarely yield reasonable results for DOT 406 or DOT 412 cargo tanks
having a MAWP of 15 psig or less. Commenters recommended two alternatives to the ASME UG23(b) design calculations,
both of which are formulas from engineering texts. One is from the ``Alcoa Structural Handbook,'' 1960, page 156 and
Table 23; the other is from ``Formulas for Stress and Strain,'' Fifth Edition, by Roark and Young, pages 554 and 555
and Table 35. The ``Alcoa Structural Handbook'' formula is as follows:




<IMPORT>



E:GRAPHICSER03NO94.000


</IMPORT>



where:
R

i

/t

s

 is greater than 200
E = modulus of elasticity of material at design temperature
R

i

 = inside radius of the shell (largest radius of non-circular cross-section)
t

s

 = minimum thickness of shell less corrosion allowance
S

bA

 = critical compressive buckling stress per the Alcoa formula
S

c

 = allowable compressive stress due to static bending loads



The Roark and Young formula is as follows:




<IMPORT>



E:GRAPHICSER03NO94.001


</IMPORT>



where:



R

i

/t

s

 is greater than 10
S

bY

 = critical compressive buckling stress per Roark and Young
v = Poisson's ratio



Other symbols are the same as in the Alcoa formula, above.
Based on the merit of these comments, RSPA is revising paragraph (b) to allow alternative methods for determining
compressive buckling stress for DOT 400-series cargo tanks which are not required to be certified in accordance with
the ASME Code. This allows manufacturers more freedom in the design of DOT 400-series cargo tank motor vehicles, particularly
the DOT 406 cargo tank.
RSPA solicited information on the structural integrity of cargo tanks and, in particular, the loading combinations
that may be encountered during operation of cargo tank motor vehicles as prescribed in paragraph (c). Information
was received from several commenters which indicated that the loadings from normal operating conditions are different
from loadings experienced in extreme dynamic events. The normal operating loadings are more frequent in occurrence,
but much lower than the extreme dynamic loadings.
