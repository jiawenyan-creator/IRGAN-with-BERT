FT  09 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
STOCK index futures drifted lower yesterday as the market continued to lack
a strong sense of direction and turnover remained depressed.
The June FT-SE 100 index contract initially commanded a strong lead over the
stock market of around 30 Footsie points. However, with no real basis of
support the futures market's premium was quickly frittered away, and by the
time Wall Street opened, the June contract was back to its 15-point fair
value premium.
Institutional investors made an appearance in the market, returning to take
profits. One broker said the selling confirmed that 'the institutions were
back in force', with many taking the view that the market had little
immediate upside potential. But selling had not been aggressive.
The June FT-SE closed at 2,540, down 26 points, while its premium to the
spot index finished at 16 compared with 29 at the previous close.
Turnover on the traded options market remained low. Allied-Lyons was the
busiest stock option as a mixture of speculative July 600 call buying and
two-way dealing in July 550 puts lifted turnover. A total of 1,522 contracts
changed hands.
British Telecom had 1,392 lots traded, with switching out of May 330 calls
into August 360 calls and puts boosting dealing.
