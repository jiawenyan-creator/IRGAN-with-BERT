FT  29 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Spices
SPICES After a long period of continuously declining prices we can now
report a more bullish trend at least for white pepper writes Man-Producten.
White pepper prices hit a level of some usd 1100/mt cif a fortnight ago but
is not available today below usd 1350 cif. The firmer trend is not caused by
larger demand from consumption markets but is only due to sudden demand in
the origin market. It may be too optimistic to expect that prices will
maintain or go higher from now on. As to black pepper, prices also stopped
declining further but here we have not seen any further improvement. Black
pepper faq is offered at usd 900 cif.
