  [Excerpt] Interior Relations Minister Ramon Escovar Salom 
said yesterday that investigations into the listening devices 
discovered at Miraflores Presidential Palace are still in a 
preliminary phase. "The courts are investigating and that is why 
I do not want to say anything about it. Period." 
  He said there is nothing extraordinary about a case like 
this 
being investigated because this type of investigation occurs 
routinely. The interior minister called attention to the fact 
that when he was presidency secretary general, he requested 
several electronic searches of his and the president's offices. 
He also acknowledged that when he was in charge of the Office of 
the Prosecutor General, he would order electronic searches every 
10 days because there were too many people who were tempted to 
listen in on what was being said. He said that one time, the 
electronic searches discovered a transmission device, but it did 
not go anywhere specific because it had been discarded for some 
time. 
  The minister did not want to confirm whether an espionage 
center connected to La Torre de Las Delicias, the Defense 
Ministry, and Banco Latino really did exist. "I do not want to 
comment on that issue because I am waiting for some information." 
  According to the minister, his office constantly has this 
problem, and this is one reason why electronic searches are 
routinely conducted. [passage omitted]
