FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Unison network insurers to
exchange directors
Leading members of the Unison international insurance broking network have
announced an exchange of board directorships among European and US partner
companies, writes Ralph Atkins in London.
Mr John Gussenhoven, Unison president, said the exchanges could be a prelude
to increasing cross-shareholdings between members, all privately-owned
insurance brokers. Unison's members include US group Johnson &amp; Higgins,
Jauch &amp; Hubener of Germany, Gras Savoye of France and Gil y Carvajal of
Spain.
Unison has a network of some 250 offices in about 60 countries and acts, in
effect, as an international network for members. Mr Gussenhoven said each
company valued their independence but expanding cross-shareholdings could
allow members to participate in each other's results.
Johnson &amp; Higgins announced it has appointed three new directors: Mr
Christian Dahms, partner of Jauch &amp; Hubener; Mr Patrick Lucas, chairman of
Gras Savoye; and Mr Santiago Gil de Biedma, chairman of Gil y Garvajal.
Similarly, Jauch &amp; Hubener announced it would add three new members to the
appropriate board, including Mr Gussenhoven, director of Johnson &amp; Higgins.
