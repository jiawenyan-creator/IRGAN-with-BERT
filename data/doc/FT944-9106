FT  17 NOV 94 / Important oil concession to be handed back to Colombia
A Royal Dutch/Shell subsidiary today hands back an important oil concession
to Colombia's state-owned oil company, Ecopetrol, after the government
declined to extend its operating contract, reports Stephen Fidler.
The subsidiary, Hocol, took over the 16,000 bpd concession from Tenneco in
1988. The concession, Nieva 540, consists of 10 fields and 134 oil wells
about 150 miles south-west of Bogota. Hocol said it was disappointed and
would appeal against the decision.
The move follows an unsuccessful round of oil and gas tenders this year, in
which bids were submitted for only four of the 21 exploration blocks on
offer.
Mr David Battman, of Control Risks Group in London, says security remains a
concern for oil companies operating in the country. But after having 'shot
itself in the foot over Shell', the government must be 'seen to make more
effort to entice foreign capital and expertise with more attractive contract
terms and guarantees on taxation levels,' he said.
