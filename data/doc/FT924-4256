FT  03 DEC 92 / People: General Electric woos Scholey
Sir David Scholey, chairman of S G Warburg, has underlined the close ties
between one of Britain's biggest industrial companies and its premier
merchant bank, by accepting a non-executive directorship of the General
Electric Company.
Sir David, 57, is one of two new faces in the GEC boardroom. Sir Christopher
Harding, 53, chairman of BET and a long-time director of Hanson, has also
joined the board. Meanwhile, Dr Tony O'Reilly, 56, the Irish-born
entrepreneur who heads the H J Heinz Company, has resigned after two years
as a GEC director.
The appointment of two powerful non-executive directors to the GEC board -
Sir David is a director of BT and Sir Christopher is on the boards of
English China Clays, Slough Estates and Newarthill - is likely to be
welcomed by the City. Although Lord Weinstock, the 68-year-old managing
director who has dominated GEC since the early 1960s, has given no
indication when he will step down, there has been concern about his
successor.
Non-executive directors were already in a majority on the GEC board, and the
two new figures will lay to rest any doubts that the rest of the GEC board
is strong enough to stand up to Lord Weinstock on the succession issue.
The links between Warburg and GEC go back a long way. Sir Ronald Grierson,
who was involved in the company's early development, was a Warburg director
for many years and only stepped down as GEC's vice chairman just over a year
ago. Lord Weinstock's son, Simon, worked at Warburg before joining GEC in
1983 and Warburg is a financial adviser to GEC.

Lawrence Urquhart, 57, chief executive of Burmah Castrol, and Peter
Middleton, 51, chief executive of Lloyd's of London, have been appointed
non-executive directors of BAA. Meanwhile, Denis Cassidy, retires as a
non-executive director.
