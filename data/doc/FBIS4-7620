  [Text] Belgrade, April 3 (TANJUG) -- Foreign Minister of 
the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) Slobodan Jarcevic described 
as positive development the agreement on cessation of 
hostilities which the RSK and Croatia signed last Wednesday in 
the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. 
  Hoping that the agreement would be the first step towards 
the 
normalization of relations between the two sides, Jarcevic told 
Radio Belgrade on Sunday that the agreement did not tackle 
demarcation issues. 
  The territories which remained in the so-called buffer zone 
or on Croatian side will be discussed as part of the demarcation 
package, he explained. 
  The RSK was created in 1991 in predominantly Serb-populated 
areas in Croatia in response to Croatia's violent secession from 
the former Yugoslav Federation. It was placed under U.N. 
protection in March 1992. 
  The Zagreb agreement may prove detrimental only on one 
point: 
If Croatia transfers troops from the borders with the RSK to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to support the all-out Moslem offensive 
against Bosnian Serbs, said Jarcevic.
