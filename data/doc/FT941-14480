FT  20 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Warranty issue to be considered
Sir, Your report headed 'OFT to probe sales of electrical warranties'
(January 18) is premature and therefore misleading.
The director-general of fair trading has been asked by government ministers
to consider whether the practice of some retailers of promoting their own
extended warranty schemes should be investigated as a breach of the
Restrictive Trade Practices Act. This was alleged in a recent parliamentary
question by Mr Nigel Griffiths MP.
The Office of Fair Trading is therefore considering the issue and the
director-general will reach a conclusion in due course. Your report that we
are making inquiries with a view to launching an investigation pre-empts the
actual position which is to determine whether or not an investigation is
necessary.
