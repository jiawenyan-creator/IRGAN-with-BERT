  [Text] Johannesburg April 27 SAPA -- Police have arrested 
31 suspects and confiscated arms and explosives in connection 
with the recent bomb blasts at Johannesburg, Germiston and Jan 
Smuts Airport. 
  This was announced by Police Commissioner Johan van der 
Merwe 
at a special press conference held at Caeser's Palace, 
Braamfontein, where exhibits and a special video tape was made 
available to the media. He said teams of SAP [South African 
Police] members had worked around the clock for the past few 
days to hunt down those responsible for the blasts and to 
prevent further blasts. 
  "The result was a remarkable breakthrough resulting in 31 
arrests," he said. 
  The arrests were carried out in Rustenberg, Ventersdorp and 
Pretoria and involved the Afrikaner Weerstandbeweging's [AWB, 
[Afrikaner Resistance Movement] elite Ystergarde [Iron Guard]. 
  Gen van der Merwe said some had given themselves up and that 
those arrested included a police reservist. Those arrested were 
the brains of the group and it could not be excluded that others 
were involved, including leaders, but this was currently under 
further investigation. 
  The first suspect was arrested and held under Section 29 of 
the Internal Security Act on Sunday, but the rest were regular 
arrests, gen van der merwe said. He said the suspects were being 
held at various locations which were being kept secret. 
  The successful results were primarily the product of good 
intelligence work, he said. 
  Those arrests were all allegedly connected to the bombs 
which were detonated in central Johannesburg on Sunday, at the 
Germiston taxi rank on Monday, the Pretoria restaurant on Monday 
night and Wednesday's Jan Smuts Airport blast. The three 
explosions claimed 21 lives and injured 173 people. 
  Other blasts where only material damage was caused were also 
being linked to the group. These occurred at taxi ranks in 
Randfontein and Westonaria on Monday morning.
