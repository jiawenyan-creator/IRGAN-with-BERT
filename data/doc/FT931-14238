FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Overseas holders to dispose of 45% Watts
Blake stake
LEBANESE, Belgian and German shareholders yesterday announced plans to sell
a combined 45 per cent stake in Watts Blake Bearne. The move is expected to
trigger a full scale bid for the world's largest ball clay producer.
Ceramics Holdings, controlled by the Lebanese Gargour family, Sibelco, a
privately owned Belgian-based producer of silica sand for the glass industry
and Quarzwerke, a private German producer of silica sand, are making the
sale under a concert party agreement in April 1991.
The companies said that under takeover rules: 'the acquisition of the
concert party members' holdings is likely to lead to an offer for the entire
issued share capital of the company.'
Mr John Pike, managing director of Watts Blake, said a sale to a single
purchaser would make it very difficult for the company to defend itself from
an unwelcome bidder.
'The board is gravely concerned about a number of issues that could arise
from this proposed sale. including the implications for the company's
employees and the local communities in which it operates,' said Mr Pike.
The group based in Newton Abbot, Devon also owns extensive reserves of ball
clay in the US and Germany. Almost two thirds of sales are used for the
manufacture of sanitary ware and wall and floor tiles.
Its performance is dependent upon the health of the construction industry;
pre-tax profits in 1991 fell by 27 per cent to Pounds 5.67m.
Profits in the fist six months of last year, however, rose by 7 per cent to
Pounds 3.74m helped by acquisitions.
Should a recommended purchaser offer less than 433p a share, Sibelco and
Quarzwerke have the right to buy Ceramics' shares at the same price.
Watts Blake shares yesterday rose from 425p to 433p having touched 455p at
one stage.
