FT  03 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Confusing the duties of the pensions
custodian
Sir, Professor Julian Franks and Professor Stephen Schaefer (Personal View:
'Safety net for pensions custodians', February 24) suggest that the answer
to 'the Maxwell problem' is to make custodians directly answerable to a
pension fund's beneficiaries.
The picture which this conjures up, of custodians deciding whether a
particular instruction from the trustees or the investment manager is
prejudicial to the interests of the beneficiaries, is quite touching.
Instead of separating the custody and trusteeship roles, this solution
confuses them.
Rather than limit the compensation scheme to apply where the custodians have
defaulted on their quasi-trustee role, would it not accord with
Franks-Schaefer logic to make it a legal obligation that custodians did not
hold the assets at all, but that they were held by sub-custodians (who would
hold a duty of care, and so on)?
The buck must stop somewhere, and all that the Franks-Schaefer solution does
is to pass it on. Whether or not would-be custodians will be queueing up to
assume these additional duties and responsibilities is another matter.
