ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PERMIT FOR HOME DENIED AFTER CRIME 
COMPLAINTS 
Bowing to complaints from neighbors, the City Council has voted unanimously to 
deny a request to build a single-family home in a district plagued by crime and 
beset by problems with undocumented workers. 
The council's action came Tuesday night after 10 residents of the area around 
Walnut Street south of Chapman Avenue gave emotional testimony, saying the 
two-story home, like others in the neighborhood, would be used as a 
boardinghouse for illegal aliens, and that might lead to more crime in the 
area. 
Melissa Albidrez, a Walnut Street resident, said that a code enforcement 
officer inspects homes in the area "in less than a minute" and that police 
reports listing complaints are incomplete. 
"The lack of communication between city officials and this community is 
disgraceful," she said. 
Mayor pro Tem Norman Z. Eckenrode and Councilman John O. Tynes both decided to 
vote against the construction permit request after a representative of the lot 
owner told the council that the house would be used as a rental.
