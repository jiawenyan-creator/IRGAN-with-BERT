FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: Banco Popular sees income rise
18.9%
BANCO POPULAR, the Spanish commercial bank, yesterday reported net income of
Pta27.8bn (Dollars 288m) for the first half of 1992, an 18.9 per cent
increase on the first six months of last year. Pre-tax income rose 13 per
cent to Pta43.9bn.
The bank said that, excluding an extraordinary gain of Pta1.6bn from the
sale of a banking subsidiary, ordinary net income had grown 12 per cent in
the first half.
Popular is recognised as one of the world's most profitable banks and the
relatively slow growth in profits, it said, should be seen in the light of a
sharp slowdown in the Spanish economy this year.
The bank said first-half net interest income had grown by 5.8 per cent to
Pta74.3bn.
