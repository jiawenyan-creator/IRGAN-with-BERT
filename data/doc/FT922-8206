FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Sega agrees to pay Dollars 43m
in US patent settlement
SEGA Enterprises, the Japanese video game maker, has agreed to pay Dollars
43m to settle a patent dispute with a US inventor. The agreement is the
second large US patent payout by a Japanese technology company in recent
weeks.
Sega, through its subsidiary, Sega of America, was to fight a Dollars 33m
Californian court award last month to the inventor, Mr Jan Coyle. However
the company decided that the potential financial and public relations costs
of an appeal outweighed the likely benefits of the action.
The dispute is over colour image-display technology used in video games, on
which two other makers, Nintendo of Japan and Atari of the US, have already
reached settlements with Mr Coyle.
Sega and Sega of America will share the two-part payment, Dollars 23m of
which will be delivered next Monday, with the remainder due by August 17,
when the patent on the technology expires.
Until the court ruling, Sega had celebrated dramatic growth in sales, which
doubled in the year to the end of March to an estimated Y213bn (Dollars
1.60bn).
The company is forecasting a pre-tax profit of Y33.4bn, also double the
amount of fiscal 1990.
Mr Hayao Nakayama, president and the architect of the Sega's rise to
international prominence, had condemned the US jury system for allowing
'amateurs' to decide on complex technical issues.
'We have concerns about the jury's level of understanding. This is a rather
simple case and it is clear that we should be okay. We had certainly taken
professional advice, and our professional told us we would win,' Mr Nakayama
said last month.
The company's decision to settle follows a similar agreement by Minolta, the
Japanese camera-maker, which agreed to pay Dollars 127.5m to Honeywell, the
US technology company, after a court ruled it had infringed patents for
autofocus technology.
