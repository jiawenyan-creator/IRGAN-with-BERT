FT  17 OCT 92 / No switch for Italian television channels
THE Italian government has decided to leave unchanged for another year the
structure of the television industry, split among the three state-controlled
channels of RAI TV and the private concessions dominated by Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Fininvest media group.
The decision will allow time for a more measured assessment of the role of
state television at a time of extreme financial uncertainty and political
change.
The RAI is owned by IRI, the state holding company which in August became a
joint stock company owned by the Treasury. This move has thrown into doubt
both IRI's continued ownership of the RAI and its funding base. Some
deputies are calling for the winding up of RAI or at least the sale of two
channels.
These changes, combined with the discredited overt political control of the
state television, are forcing a redefinition of the RAI's role. Until now
RAI Uno, the main state channel, has been run by the Christian Democrats,
RAI Due by the Socialists and RAI Tre by the former communist Party of the
Democratic Left.
The structure reflected a wholly different political picture when the
Christian Democrats and Socialists dominated the levers of institutional
power and the communists were the party of opposition.
The April general elections and the corruption scandals of the past nine
months have undermined the authority of the traditional parties. There is
also a move for change from within RAI. In the past month RAI Uno
journalists have passed a vote of no confidence against Mr Bruno Vespa, the
Christian Democrat director of news.
This week the Amato government has put the squeeze on RAI by refusing
requests for an increase in licence fees and the amount of time available
for advertising slots.
