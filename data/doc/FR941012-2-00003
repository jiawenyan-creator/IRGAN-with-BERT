Summary 


The purpose of this notice is to amend our preliminary determination (59 FR 48284, September 20, 1994) with regard
to respondents Grupo Andes and Grupo Benilda, and to the ``all-others'' rate. 


Case History 


On September 12, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) made its affirmative preliminary determination
of sales at less than fair value (59 FR 48284, September 20, 1994). 
On September 16, 1994, Grupo Andes, Grupo Benilda, Grupo Intercontinental, and the Prisma Group alleged that the
Department, in making its determination, made ministerial errors which led to the application of best information
available (BIA). They requested that the Department correct the ministerial errors, amend its preliminary determination,
and recalculate the all others rate. In addition, Grupo Andes requested that the Department reverse its preliminary
decision not to verify its information. 
On September 21, 1994, counsel for Grupo Andes, Grupo Benilda, Grupo Intercontinental and the Prisma Group met with
officials of the Department of Commerce (see the September 22, 1994, 

ex-parte

 memorandum). Also on September 21, 1994, the Caicedo Group alleged that the Department made ministerial errors in
calculating its dumping margin and requested that the Department correct these errors and amend the preliminary
determination. On September 21, 1994, petitioner submitted comments opposing respondents' ministerial error
allegations and their request to amend the preliminary determination. On September 22, 1994, counsel for petitioner
met with officials of the Department of Commerce (see the September 22, 1994, 

ex-parte

 memorandum). On September 23, 1994, petitioner submitted a written summary of its September 22, 1994, meeting comments.



On September 26, 1994, Grupo Tropicales alleged that the Department made ministerial errors in calculating its dumping
margin and requested that the Department correct these errors and amend the preliminary determination. 


Amendment of Preliminary Determination 


The Department has determined that the allegations of the Caicedo Group, Grupo Intercontinental, Grupo Prisma,
and Grupo Tropicales involved issues that were other than clerical or ministerial in nature. Consequently, we are
not amending our preliminary determination with respect to these companies. However, we are amending the preliminary
determination for Grupo Andes and Grupo Benilda. Accordingly, we have recalculated the ``all others'' rate. Set
forth below is the basis for our amended preliminary determination with respect to these companies. 
It is not our normal practice to amend preliminary determinations since these determinations only establish estimated
margins, which are subject to verification and which may change in the final determination. However, because of the
specific facts pertaining to this investigation, the Department has determined to amend its preliminary determination
to correct for the significant ministerial errors involved. See the Department's proposed 19 CFR 353.15(g)(4) (57
FR 1131, 1132 (January 10, 1992)); Amendment to Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Sweaters
Wholly or in Chief Weight of Man-Made Fiber from Hong Kong, 55 Fed. Reg. 1928990 (May 9, 1990).
