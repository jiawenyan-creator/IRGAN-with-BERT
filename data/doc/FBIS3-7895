  [Text] Prague Feb 28 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry 
was shocked at the news of a terrible massacre of Palestinian 
Moslems in Hebron, the ministry said in a statement given to CTK 
by Spokesman Vit Kurfurst on Monday [28 February]. 
  It is the task for all parties involved in the conflict and 
the whole international community to prevent the repetition of 
such tragic events which lead to further escalation of violence 
and could become an insurmountable obstacle for the current 
promising procedure of peace talks, the statement says. 
  The Foreign Ministry hopes that all parties involved, 
carried 
by responsibility for the possible loss of other human lives, 
will resort to intensive talks as soon as possible which would 
lead to achieving just, permanent and comprehensive peaceful 
solution, Kurfurst said. 
  At least 50 people were killed in Friday's attack by a 
Jewish 
settler against Moslems in the holy complex Tombs of the 
Prophets in the town of Hebron on the occupied West Bank of the 
River Jordan. It is the largest massacre since 1967 when the 
West Bank and Gaza zone were occupied by Israel. 
  The massacre provoked protest demonstrations in Israel and 
around countries. The Israeli Government ordered that leaders of 
the extremist Jewish organisation Kach to which the attacker 
belonged be arrested. The majority of European countries were 
shocked by the massacre and expressed concern about the future 
of the peace process. The United Nations Security Council is to 
take a definitive stand on the event at its session today.
