THE WORLD 
Donald P. Gregg, the new U.S. ambassador to South Korea, arrived in Seoul and 
said Washington will keep the approximately 40,000-strong American force on the 
peninsula until South Koreans decide otherwise. Gregg, 61, was confirmed by the 
Senate last Tuesday. His nomination had been held up in the Senate since March 
over assertions that he had lied to cover up President Bush's alleged 
complicity in the Iran-Contra scandal. His arrival in Seoul precedes a 
scheduled three-day visit by Vice President Dan Quayle starting Tuesday.
