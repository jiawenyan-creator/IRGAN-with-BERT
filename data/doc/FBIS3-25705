  [Summary From Poor Reception] The present administration in 
the country is 100 days old in office. It come into power on 17 
November 1993 with a broadcast by the head of state, General 
Sani Abacha. 
  "Nigerians have been speaking on the performance of the 
administration since its assuming office. While some believe 
that 100 days were still short to assess the performance of the 
administration, others say the government has done well so far." 
"Many people feel that the government has not done much in its 
first 100 days," but some have a "different opinion considering 
all that happened before the coming to power of this 
administration." They think "it will take a rather long time 
for things to normalize." Some say that the political situation 
and the political crisis that prevailed in the country have been 
brought to normal and that "Nigerians have become one once 
again." They add that when the national conference comes on it 
is then Nigerians will know exactly what Abacha has done. 
  Some Nigerians say that all government institutions are now 
performing well which is a very good beginning that gives credit 
to the present government. They say the government has taken 
the bull by the horn by engaging into an area which "the 
previous governments never looked into like trying to sanitize 
the Nigerian society."
