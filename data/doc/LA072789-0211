WORLD; 
SOVIETS EASE UP ON BALTIC REPUBLICS 
The Soviet Parliament today adopted two resolutions paving the way for the 
Baltic republics to have greater control of their economies. 
The action by the Supreme Soviet was a major victory for Baltic activists, who 
have accused Moscow of sapping the republics' natural resources and failing to 
help preserve their native cultures. 
One resolution would allow Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to trade independently 
with other Soviet republics, Tass said. Under the second resolution, Estonian 
and Lithuanian authorities, instead of officials in Moscow, will decide 
production matters and control how profits are spent. 
The resolutions call on the Council of Ministers to draw up draft laws on the 
resolutions and submit them to the Supreme Soviet by Oct. 1 for approval, Tass 
said.
