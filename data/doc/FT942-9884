FT  13 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Satellites to guide ambulance
service
Satellites will soon come to the rescue of accident victims in the UK - by
pinpointing ambulances to within a few feet.
West Midlands Ambulance Service will use a new system based on satellite
navigation technology. 'The satellite system will talk to our existing
computerised control and command system in a way never previously
attempted,' says Ian Van Creveld, operations director.
Developed by Terrafix, a UK company, it works from radio signals transmitted
by at least three satellites. These are picked up by a receiver in the
ambulance which uses them to give a 'fix' on its position.
A data channel on the radio system is used to communicate its position to
the control room; it is translated into map co-ordinates of position,
direction and speed. The information is used to work out response times.
West Midlands Ambulance Service: UK, 0384 455644.
