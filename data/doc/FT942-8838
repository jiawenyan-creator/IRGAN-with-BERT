FT  18 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Lufthansa shows further
weakness in Germany
The markets were generally lacklustre awaiting the outcome of yesterday's
FOMC meeting.
FRANKFURT moved into retreat as Monday's record levels failed to inspire a
follow on of momentum. The Dax index eased back 11.40 to 2,259.71 during the
official session. Turnover was DM7.4bn.
Sentiment was upset by news that Schneider debt was higher than anticipated,
with estimates of between DM3.5bn to DM4bn.
This report affected the banks who are exposed to the property group with
Deutsche Bank, for example, slipping DM10 to DM781.50.
Lufthansa continued to weaken on a further round of selling following
disappointment over its results on Monday, the shares down a further DM11.30
to DM190.20, bringing accumulated losses since the start of the week to 8
per cent.
In contrast, Volkswagen rose DM3.20 to DM528.70 on news that it was
extending working hours at some plants. Nikko Europe issued a buy
recommendation earlier in the week, noting that the restructuring programmes
should begin to bear fruit in the near term. Furthermore, said Nikko, 'Seat
should report a considerable reduction in last year's loss of DM1.8bn, with
a return to profit in 1995 the target'.
PARIS took a long look at Eurotunnel which held a shareholders meeting
yesterday to approve its rights issue plans. The group lost FFr1.30 to
FFr35.10 but off a session low of FFr34.70 as the CAC-40 index rose 7.47 to
2,195.17.
Turnover was a moderate FFr3.7bn.
Oil stocks were active as Merrill Lynch added Elf Aquitaine and OMV to its
stock selection list and deleted Total and Repsol. Of the French groups Elf
was FFr2.70 stronger at FFr429.70 while Total shed FFr4.90 to FFr342.10.
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, down FFr12 at FFr598, denied that it was planning
to raise fresh capital, while Club Med slipped FFr1.90 to FFr446.10 as it
forecast a better first half result.
MILAN began the new account in resilient mood, the Comit index rising 11.89
or 1.5 per cent to 801.62, as worries subsided about the outcome of today's
parliamentary confidence vote.
Blue chips led the advance. Generali rose L1,567 or 3.3 per cent to L48,470,
Fiat advanced L149 to L7,188 and Olivetti was L128 or 4.5 per cent higher at
L3,003.
Ciga, the hotels group advanced L76 or 6.8 per cent to L1,188 in heavy
volume of 36m shares amid speculation about stock building as its rights
issue sold out.
Ferruzzi put on L149 or 7.1 per cent to L2,233 as the company launched its
L1,340bn rights issue. Cir rose L134 or 4.7 per cent to L2,994 as its
L1,060bn rights issue began, although technical problems blocked business in
the rights throughout the session.
ZURICH continued on the upward track as domestic buying, and an absence of
foreign selling, took the SMI index 18.1 higher to 2,727.1.
Roche certificates added SFr155 to SFr6,705 as presentations to analysts
yesterday and on Monday were well received and details of the Syntex
takeover appeared to be positive. The certificates have picked up 9 per cent
since their low on May 9, following 1993 figures and the Syntex acquisition.
However, analysts noted that yesterday's demand came from Swiss banks,
buying for their own account, and that sentiment remained fragile.
Nestle, another recent weak performer, rose SFr20 to SFr1,135, on the
perception that recent falls had been overdone. Brown Boveri rose SFr13 to
SFr1,275 ahead of today's first quarter figures, with some analysts
forecasting a rise of up to 75 per cent in profit.
STOCKHOLM maintained a strong run with Astra featuring ahead of first
quarter results that came out after the close of business. The Affarsvarlden
general index added 7.70 to 1,552.50.
Turnover was SKr2.6bn.
Astra reported a 15 per cent rise in first quarter pretax profits - the B
shares ended the day up SKr1 at SKr161.
Volvo, which releases its first quarter figures today, picked up SKr13 in
the B shares to SKr758.
AMSTERDAM struggled to find some incentive to move and, with the exception
of a Fl 2.30 loss in KLM to Fl 53.20, due in partly to profit-taking
following good gains last week, the AEX index finished the session just 0.81
ahead at 413.81.
MADRID overcame some early profit-taking with late demand taking the general
index up 0.71 to finish at the day's high of 334.91 in heavy turnover of
Pta36.59bn.
Banks, however, remained under pressure with Banesto Pta25 easier at
Pta1,120. Argentaria lost Pta100 to Pta6,000 and Santander was marked Pta80
lower at Pta6,350.
Agroman, the construction company, was the day's leader, rising Pta75 to
Pta825.
ISTANBUL rose 3.55 per cent on a technical rebound following a reduction in
interest rates. The composite index put on 549.02 to 16,032.68. On Monday
the index lost 1 per cent.
ATHENS ended slightly lower in light trading as investors remained worried
about the prospect of devaluation. The general share index lost 7.95 at
944.94. Turnover was Dkr2.7bn.
