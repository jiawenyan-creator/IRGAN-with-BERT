  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The partnership promotion of the 
Russian reforms remains a main goal of German ostpolitik. With 
this guideline, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel concluded the 
first working conference of the German ambassadors to the 12 
successor states of the Soviet Union (CIS) in Bonn on Tuesday 
[21 June]. Speaking to the press, Kinkel, who expressed "some 
shock about the gigantic problems of reconstruction," stressed 
that another urgent goal is the stabilization of Ukraine, which 
is still "the world's third largest nuclear power." In this 
process, making the Chernobyl nuclear power plant -- there are 
another 21 reactors of this type in operation -- safer must be a 
priority. 
  The foreign minister admitted that at the forthcoming 
European summit on Corfu over the weekend, there is once again 
hardly any chance to make the partner states agree to the 
immediate aid program with lasting safety, which has been 
proposed by Germany and France. 
  Regarding East Europe, German policy must also -- in 
addition 
to priority support to the reform processes -- contribute to 
defusing the nationality conflicts, develop markets, and satisfy 
the enormous need for cultural information in the new states. 
With this balance sheet of the ambassadors' conference, Kinkel 
linked a renewed rejection of Russian ideas concerning a new 
European security system, in which NATO is to make itself 
subordinate to CSCE. "For us, NATO remains the absolute 
security anchor," Kinkel stressed.
