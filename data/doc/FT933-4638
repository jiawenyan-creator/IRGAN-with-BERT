BBC2's sports journalism series, On The Line, examines Beijing's bid to
stage the Olympics in the year 2000. The emergence of Chinese athletes at
the World Championships in Stuttgart, particularly female distance runners,
and the Chinese medal count at the Barcelona Olympics have put China on the
international sporting map. There has, however, been a lot of muttering
about precisely how those successes were achieved. The programme tries to
find out (8.30). At the same time C4 repeats the episode of Inspector Morse
in which the Jag driving ale enthusiast investigates the death of a
deaconess.
BBC1's Inside Story penetrates the murky world of prostitution in the
Paddington area of London (9.30). The programme goes undercover with the
police vice unit as they track down and arrest the pimp of a 16-year-old
prostitute and raid a brothel run by the Chinese mafia, the Triads.
Sportsnight reports on the qualifying games for the football World Cup:
England v. Poland, Wales v. Czech/Slovak republics, Scotland v. Switzerland
and Northern Ireland v. Latvia (10.20).
