REAGANS' PRIMARY HOME 
Ruth Ryon's column (Jan. 29) raised the question whether the White House or the 
Santa Barbara estate would be considered the Reagans' primary residence 
eligible for certain tax advantages (i.e. rollover of the gain). Richard Nixon 
fought the same battle and lost to the IRS. Nixon tried to argue that his San 
Clemente estate was his primary residence, but the IRS correctly held that 
during his years in office the White House was his primary residence, and 
therefore any gain on other properties was subject to tax currently.
