FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (2): A chequered pattern /
Review of the outlook in the world's main car markets
LEADING western car makers have intensified warnings in recent weeks that
west European new car sales would fall in 1993 for the second successive
year.
According to Mr Louis Hughes, president of General Motors Europe, west
European new car sales will drop to 13.3m this year from 13.43m in 1991 and
will be 'clearly under 13m' in 1993 'if present consumer uncertainty in some
markets continues'.
Only the inclusion of eastern Germany has masked the fact that new car sales
elsewhere in west Europe have been in decline since the record year of 1989.
According to Automotive Industry Data, the UK-based automotive analysts, new
car sales in west Europe (excluding east Germany) peaked in 1989 at
13,467,000 and then fell to 13,259,000 in 1990 and 12,763,000 last year.
German reunification added a new market, eastern Germany, which last year at
730,000 was the sixth largest in Europe. This allowed the total west
European market to remain at a record level with sales in 1990 of 13,489,000
and 13,493,000 in 1991.
Even the enlargement of the market can no longer disguise the weakening
trend of demand for new cars, however.
Mr Allan Gilmour, president of Ford's worldwide automotive operations,
maintains that in addition to the severe recession in the UK 'recent
currency and interest rate fluctuations throughout Europe have created
uncertainty and reduced consumer confidence.
'Now we are seeing slow-downs in Spain, France and Italy and, to some
extent, in Germany. Near-term prospects for the auto industry in Europe are
not very good.'
According to Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of PSA Peugeot Citroen, west
European new car sales will fall by 1.5 per cent this year with a further
1.3 per cent fall in 1993 as political and economic factors generate greater
gloom in Europe.
'Looming elections, triumphant monetarism - as the Bundesbank leads and
France merely follows - structural problems in the UK and the determination
to correct certain economic and financial imbalances in Spain and Italy are
causing consumer spending and investment either to stagnate or decline.'
He expects European exports to be complicated by the 'combination of
unstable EC exchange rates, a weak dollar and the deliberately undervalued
yen. As a result unemployment is on the rise.'
Prospects in North America and in Japan are not much more encouraging. 'The
US is showing some signs of improvement,' says Mr Gilmour, 'but if it's a
recovery, it's a painfully slow-developing one.'
Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan Motor, Japan's second largest
vehicle maker, said this month that 'the global motor industry today is
facing a business climate of unprecedented severity'. Vehicle demand had
dropped in all three of the world's major motor markets, Europe, the US and
Japan, and he warned that 'there is little expectation that the market will
recover quickly in the immediate future'.
DRI, the UK-based automotive analysts, forecast that worldwide new car sales
this year will be virtually unchanged at 34.05m compared with 34.04m last
year. The drop of 2.7 per cent in 1991 from 34.97m in 1990 was the largest
sales reduction since the 1980/81 recession.
The latest DRI forecast made in autumn 1992 suggests that new car sales
worldwide will begin to recover next year with an increase of 4.5 per cent
to 35.59m. The study suggests that demand will continue to expand through
the mid-1990s with sales breaking through the 40m barrier in 1997 to reach
40.7m.
The forecast growth in demand next year is expected to be supported by a
marked strengthening of new car sales in the US coupled with a return to
growth in Japan after two years of falling new car registrations.
While sales in west Europe are forecast to fall further by 1.8 per cent to
13.15m next year, the latest DRI study suggests that sales in North America
will jump by 11.0 per cent to 10.26m in 1993 with demand in Japan rising by
3.0 per cent to 4.71m.
Car sales in the Asia Pacific region (excluding Japan) are expected to
remain on a fast track with demand rising by 8.4 per cent next year to 2.45m
following a jump of 7.6 per cent in 1992. New car demand in South Korea is
forecast to exceed 1m for the first time in 1994 with the market having
doubled since 1989.
Sales are also expected to expand next year in Latin America - led most
importantly by Brazil - and in east Europe.
New car demand in Japan in 1992 is falling for a second year in succession,
the first time for many years that there has been such a prolonged period of
decline. The fall of 4.6 per cent in 1991 and a forecast decline of 6 per
cent this year follow a period of extraordinary growth in the late 1980s,
when the Japanese new car market climbed from 3.28m in 1987 to 5.1m in 1990.
According to the DRI forecast Japanese new car sales are not expected to
break through the 5m barrier again before 1995/96.
In west Europe the DRI study says that new car sales will begin to recover
in 1994 helped by the climb out of prolonged recession by the UK. New car
sales in the UK are not forecast to match the 1989 peak of 2.3m, however,
until 1997 at the earliest. Steady growth in west Europe in the three years
from 1994 to 1996 is forecast to take sales above 14m for the first time in
1995 and above 15m in 1997.
The pattern of west European new car sales in the last two years has been
substantially influenced by developments in Germany, which alone now
accounts for close to 30 per cent of total west European new car
registrations.
The boom which followed reunification is now over and sales are falling.
'Germany was instrumental in supporting west European car sales and
production last year and this pivotal support has now been removed at a time
when key markets like the UK and France have still to show real signs of
recovery,' says the DRI study.
DRI forecasts that the German market will fall by 8 per cent this year to
3.8m - with some bringing forward of sales into 1992 to avoid next year's
VAT rise. It suggests the German market will bottom out at 3.5m in 1994 but
warns that 'it is not inconceivable that the projected downturn for the
German market could continue into 1994'.
