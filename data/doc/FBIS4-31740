<F P=106> [Interview with Imre Szekeres, deputy executive chairman of </F>
the Hungarian Socialist Party, by Tibor Moldovanyi; place and 
date not given: "We Are Striving for Long-Term Political 
Activity"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Moldovanyi] The Alliance of 
Free Democrats [SZDSZ] repeatedly stressed that they would ask 
for guarantees from the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] for the 
implementation of equal governing. What guarantees can you give 
them without risking the implementation of your own program? 
  [Szekeres] Negotiations about these issues have just begun 
and, obviously, both sides will modify their concepts in the 
course of the negotiations. At the talks held on 9 June, 80-85 
percent of the two parties' positions were identical. In the 
course of practical implementation, I think the most important 
thing is to create a joint government. This could create 
confidence which, together with the guarantees, will assure an 
effective government. We must work out the mechanism of seeking 
a consensus on both economic and political levels. Cooperation 
between parties, factions, and officials involved in government 
must be assured. 
  [Moldovanyi] You are heading the MSZP negotiating group in 
the committee of experts dealing with the government structure. 
What basic principles do you want to focus on in the course of 
the agreement with the SZDSZ? 
  [Szekeres] First of all, I would like to stress that I can 
only mention concrete things after the decision of the 
committee, because the negotiating partners agreed on the fact 
that they should not learn about each other's views from the 
press. The starting point of the MSZP is that the government 
should be smaller in size. This means a government of 12-14 
persons, with one minister without portfolio at most. Of 
course, we would also like to reduce the number of national 
offices. According to our plans, the Office of the Prime 
Minister will be the government coordination body. This will 
guarantee internal coordination within the government. A 
considerable ministerial independence and responsibility would 
be asserted in this system. Efficiency and cooperation between 
various ministries are the main goals. [passage omitted] 
  [Moldovanyi] Will prime minister Gyula Horn have a veto 
right over the ministerial candidates of the SZDSZ? 
  [Szekeres] The mechanism of coalition cooperation has not 
yet been clarified. It is certain, however, that it is the 
right of the prime minister to appoint ministers. The 
Constitution guarantees him this right, but a lot depends on the 
agreement of coalition partners. [passage omitted] 
  [Moldovanyi] In the course of the election campaign, the 
MSZP stressed the expertise. In several election forums, Gyula 
Horn pointed out that he would welcome in the new government 
persons who used to be ministers in the former Nemeth-cabinet or 
before that. However, the end of the Nemeth-cabinet did not only 
mean a change in the regime but also the departure of those 
whose policy failed. Will they now come back? 
  [Szekeres] I think it is a mistake to compare the former 
regime with the Nemeth cabinet, because the latter prepared the 
transition. The decisions on appointing ministers are still to 
be made, and we will also have to take into account the 
government structure. I am sure, however, that there will be 
ministers who were also members of the Nemeth cabinet, but a 
younger generation will also emerge. We are striving for a 
long-term political activity, and people who have been in the 
background will have to obtain governing experience at the level 
of state secretaries for example. It is obvious, however, that 
we are not talking about the restoration of the Nemeth cabinet.
