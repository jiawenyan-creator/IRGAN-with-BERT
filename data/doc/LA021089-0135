Supplies are so short in Veterans Administration hospitals that nurses are 
scrounging the little souvenir bars of soap and shampoo bottles from hotels to 
bring to VA patients, a nurse told Congress. Supply accounts are frequently 
raided to pay salaries and avoid layoffs, an outside medical administrator told 
the House Veterans Affairs Committee. Claudette Morissey, a nurse at the 
Brooklyn, N.Y., veterans hospital and president of the Nurses Organization of 
the Veterans Administration, said in testimony submitted to the hearing: "At 
one VA hospital in the South, nurses were frustrated by the refusal of (the) 
prosthetics (department) to supply wheel chair cushions for patients on the 
long-term care unit. The nurses obtained a $25 donation, went to the local 
upholstery store and purchased a large foam mattress, and with an electric 
knife borrowed from the mother of one of the nurses, cut the foam to make wheel 
chair cushions for their patients." She did not identify the hospital.
