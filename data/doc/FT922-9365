FT  08 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Jobs relief at Trafalgar subsidiary
NEWS OF the Tsing Mabridge contract was received yesterday with delight,
pride and some relief at Cleveland Structural Engineering, the
Darlington-based Trafalgar House subsidiary which has shed 400 jobs in the
last two years.
Managing director Mr Jeremy Beeton said the bridge superstructure accounted
for two thirds of the contract and involved 57,000 tonnes of steelwork, to
be divided between the Darlington factory and Mitsui of Japan.
The British company will be responsible for the project's most technically
critical element, the erection of the steel deck and its supporting cables.
The contract would mean a few new jobs for white-collar staff, to strengthen
teams working on other contracts.
Mr Beeton said the Tsing Ma bridge offered job security for the 750 workers
rather than substantial recruitment.
Cleveland Structural, which can fabricate 45,000 tonnes of steel a year at
Darlington, is continuing to pursue other contracts to supplement its
workload.
Steel sections of up to 20 tonnes will be shipped to an assembly yard in
China, made up into 1,800 tonne box sections and moved to the bridge site
for erection.
