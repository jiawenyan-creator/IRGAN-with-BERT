FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Relyon at Pounds 2.64m and margins held
Relyon Group, the furniture maker, reported pre-tax profits down slightly
from Pounds 2.67m to Pounds 2.64m over the 12 months to December 31.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 41.2m (Pounds 42.5m). Gross margins were
maintained but bad debts contributed to a weakening of profitability in the
core bed and cabinet furniture side, said Mr Ralph Platt, chairman.
Closure costs at Solent were taken as an extraordinary charge of Pounds
2.59m. Earnings per share were 8.86p (8.37p). The final dividend is held at
3.15p for a maintained total of 4.9p.
