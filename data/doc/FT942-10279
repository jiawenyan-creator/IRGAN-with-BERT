FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitive Headlam launches Pounds 9m
rights
Headlam, the acquisitive floorcoverings and fabrics distribution group, has
launched its second rights issue within a year in order to help finance two
further purchases.
The cash call, via the issue of up to 5.05m new ordinary shares on a 1-for-7
basis at 185p, will raise Pounds 9m net of expenses.
The acquisitions are of Gordon John Textiles, a converter and distributor of
plain and printed fabrics for the domestic and contract curtain markets, and
Wiltrex Readymades, an operator in the ready made soft furnishings market.
Consideration for Manchester-based Gordon John is Pounds 2.98m while that of
north London-based Wiltex amounts to Pounds 900,000. Both transactions will
be in cash. For the 1993 year Gordon John returned pre-tax profits of Pounds
500,000 on turnover of Pounds 14.7m. Wiltex achieved pre-tax profits of
Pounds 200,000 from turnover of Pounds 2.3m for the same year.
Mr Graham Waldron, Headlam chairman, said the acquisitions would complement
last year's purchase of Claremont Fabrics, which was part financed by a
Pounds 5.04m rights issue.
