FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Coca-Cola Amatil advances
COCA-COLA Amatil, Aus-tralia's largest soft drink and snack food group, has
lent weight to the recession-proof reputation of its operations with a solid
sales and earnings performance for 1991, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
The company yesterday announced an 8.2 per cent rise in net profits to
ADollars 68.9m (USDollars 51.8m) for the year to December against ADollars
63.7m a year earlier.
Sales advanced 16.6 per cent to ADollars 1.79bn from ADollars 1.54bn. The
annual dividend is up to 15.5 cents a share from 14.5 cents.
Coca-Cola Amatil, which dominates Coke bottling and distribution in the
Pacific Basin, completed a divestment programme during the year to limit its
operations to the core businesses of beverages and snack food.
The biggest divestment was the company's packaging division which helped
reduce net interest payments from ADollars 92.9m to ADollars 82.3m.
Depreciation charges also dropped from ADollars 58.7m to ADollars 54.0 m.
