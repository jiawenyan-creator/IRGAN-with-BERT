FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Moran cuts losses to Pounds 274,000
MORAN Holdings, the USM-traded tea producer, freight forwarder and property
developer which came out of administration in July, cut its annual losses
from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 274,000 pre-tax.
The improvement reflected record profits from the freight forwarding
division and 'substantially' better results from the Indian tea company.
Group turnover for the 12 months to June 30 advanced from Pounds 36.7m to
Pounds 45.9m. Interest charges were cut to Pounds 410,000 (Pounds 563,000)
and losses per share emerged at 16.64p (46.32p).
In the High Court in July the administration order was discharged following
a rescue package being approved by shareholders.
