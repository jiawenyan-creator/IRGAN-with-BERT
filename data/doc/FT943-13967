FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Axe for bonds
Some fixed-rate bonds, issued in recent weeks by building societies and
offering good returns, have now been withdrawn.
Chelsea building society withdrew its five-year fixed rate of 9 per cent
gross this week. Skipton has withdrawn its four-year fixed rate of 8.75 per
cent after only 12 days.
The term of the Newcastle Growth bond has been reduced from five years to
three, with rates starting at 7 per cent in the first year and rising to 7.5
in the second and 8.5 in the third.
Although these five-year fixed rates have been withdrawn, the societies
still have very good products to match National Savings. Britannia has a
one-year bond at 6.5 per cent to beat FIRST Option bonds.
A recent survey by Moneyfacts shows that an investment of Pounds 10,000 made
in building society fixed-rate products on July 1 would all pay out more
monthly interest that the Pensioners Guaranteed Income bond by the end of
the term. The leaders are Woolwich BS on the monthly option of its
Guaranteed Growth bond, and Halifax with its Stepped Income Reserve.
The Woolwich bond requires a minimum deposit of Pounds 1,000. This pays
monthly interest of 7.05 per cent in year one, 7.5 in year two, 7.95 in year
three, 9.3 in year four and 11.05 in the final year.
Guaranteed income bond rates have also held. These are of interest to
taxpayers as they are automatically paid net of basic-rate tax, which cannot
be reclaimed.
The top rate on a five-year bond at the moment pays 7.75 per cent net,
equivalent to 10.33 per cent to a basic-rate taxpayer.
