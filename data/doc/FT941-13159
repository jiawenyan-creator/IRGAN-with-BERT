FT  27 JAN 94 / Prince soothes republicans
Prince Charles last night sent a conciliatory message to Australia's
republicans, saying that the decision on whether the nation should become a
republic was 'something which only the Australian people can decide,' writes
Nikki Tait in Sydney.
Speaking at the Australia Day celebrations in Sydney, the prince referred to
the 'sheer speed of change' in the world.
The speech came less than an hour after a man broke through the crowd at
Darling Harbour and fired a starting pistol before charging towards the
Prince. The man was wrestled to the ground by plainclothes police and the
prince was unharmed.
