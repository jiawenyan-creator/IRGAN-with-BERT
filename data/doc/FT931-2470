FT  19 MAR 93 / Observer: Hippo-thetical
Nice to see a reassuring touch of German humour. A mock tombstone ad in
today's FT is Bayerische Hypo Bank's way of 'irrevocably and
unconditionally' congratulating its joint venture partner, Foreign &amp;
Colonial, on its 125th anniversary. The epitaph notes 100 per cent interest
and 100 per cent support.
Strangely, when Hypo F&amp;C chairman the Hon James Ogilvy proposed that a
combination of Germans and cuddly hippopotamuses should feature on last
year's corporate Christmas card, the Mein Herren in Munich were so unamused
that he had to go back to the drawing board.
