<F P=106> [Report by Zhozef Shapoval: ``Improvement of Nuclear Power </F>
Plants' Security Will Be Handled Jointly''] 
  [Text] Elements of the market economy are persistently 
penetrating the sphere of nuclear power engineering, which has 
been inaccessible so far. Recently in Ukraine, the first 
Ukrainian-German joint venture UNA has been established in this 
area. Among its founders were the Rivne nuclear power plant, 
the Kiev Institute Enerhoproekt, and the German joint stock 
company KAB. 
  German nuclear power engineers have great experience in 
constructing nuclear power stations and improving their 
security. The new joint venture company will reinforce hermetic 
containers of the first and second power units at the Rivne 
nuclear power plant. Experts have recommended installation of a 
pass for polluted metal in a special smelting furnace. Also 
preliminary inspection of containers has already been conducted.
