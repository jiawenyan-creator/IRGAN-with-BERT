  [Text] A top Russian Space Agency official has told 
INTERFAX that Kazakhstan had, in his view, been taking liberties 
if its interpretation of the agreement on the main principles 
and conditions of the use of the Baykonur launch site signed 
between Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev on 28 March was 
anything to go by. 
  The Moscow agreement fixed Russia's annual payments to 
Kazakhstan for the lease of Baykonur at 115 million U.S. dollars 
to include space facilities and associated services. 
  However a Kazakhstan governmental team said Thursday [19 
May] 
it had prepared a draft for putting that agreement into 
practise, a draft which set annual payments of 480 mln dlrs. 
According to Almaty, the 115 mln dlrs were a fixed payment, not 
the whole sum Russia must pay Kazakhstan for its space 
facilities. 
  The RSA official, who had been directly involved in the 
drafting of the Moscow agreement, told Interfax that he was "at 
a complete loss" as to where the 480 million dollar figure, 
which completely altered the Moscow agreement, had come from. 
  However, he said it would be "premature to dispute the draft 
before the lease agreement itself had been ratified by the 
Russian and Kazakh parliaments and had come into force." 
  The official also said that RSA chief Yuriy Koptev would be 
contacting Kazakh Vice-Premier Galym Abilsiitov regarding the 
size of the lease payment for Baykonur. 
  Kazakh officials are currently putting the finishing touches 
to the document before referring it to Prime Minister Sergey 
Tereschenko on 23 May. They say the document should be ready 
for signing by the prime ministers of both countries on 15 June 
1994. 
  However, the RSA said that date was unlikely.
