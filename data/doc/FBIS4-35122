<F P=106> [Interview with the brothers Jose Roberto and Luiz Carlos </F>
Mendonca de Barros, economic advisers to presidential candidate 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, by Ismael Bermudez in Sao Paulo, 
Brazil; date not given] 
  [Text] [CLARIN] Does the Real Plan have real possibilities? 
  [Answer] Yes. The country's external situation is stable. 
We signed the Brady Plan. The trade surplus stands at around 
$11 billion a year. The national reserves are close to $40 
billion. The budget is also balanced... 
  [CLARIN] Are you not afraid of an overvalued currency with 
positive real interest rates and additional costs on production 
and consumers? 
  [Answer] The plan has two parts. The first stage ends at the 
end of the year. It attempts to assist the transition period 
until the new government takes over, independently of who wins 
the election. Unlike the Argentine plan, we are not committed 
to maintaining a fixed foreign exchange rate. Besides, in the 
past few years, productivity has grown 35 percent in Brazil. 
There is a lot of "cream" to compensate for any overvaluation 
of the real. 
  [CLARIN] What July inflation rate are you working with? 
  [Answer] Our July inflation rate should stand at around 3.5 
to 4 percent. 
  [CLARIN] Will you "burn" reserves to keep the foreign 
exchange at a fixed rate during the first months? 
  [Answer] Yes. And that is good because it will reduce the 
need to issue money. 
  [CLARIN] How will the plan fare if Lula [Luiz Inacio Lula da 
Silva] wins? Will we witness a drain of capital? 
  [Answer] If he does not win in the first round we will have 
a 
"runoff." Fernando Henrique Cardoso has a chance. In any case, 
both sides show -- not in campaign speeches but at the level of 
the teams and the two candidates -- that there is great concern 
about preventing splits to be able to allow a future coalition 
government. This, we insist, can be seen in both camps. 
Cardoso has already said he is not an anti-Lula candidate. He 
will not say that chaos will prevail if Lula wins. This 
improves Lula's chances because he is not presented as a threat 
["cuco"]. Cardoso's line is: "I have an economic plan to defeat 
inflation. Lula does not." 
  [CLARIN] Will Cardoso form a coalition government with the 
PT 
[Workers Party] if he wins? 
  [Answer] Yes. He will try to form a coalition, at least with 
sections of the PT. That is, with the center-right wing, which 
includes Lula. 
  [CLARIN] There has been a price explosion in the past few 
days. 
  [Answer] In July, with the real, we will have price 
stability 
and consumers will be able to know the true prices of products. 
  [CLARIN] Do you not think that the dollar price will 
increase 
due to foreign exchange demand and a positive real interest rate? 
  [Answer] The prices of staples might drop. 
  [CLARIN] Then why do supermarkets say they will mark prices 
up in July? 
  [Answer] Prices will continue to be free. We might have 
adjustments due to seasonal reasons. But look out, consumers 
will be watching, and with the real those who increase prices 
will not be selling. 
  [CLARIN] Is the real plan designed to increase the electoral 
possibilities of candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso? 
  [Answer] No. The plan was delayed by Congress. The plan had 
to be implemented last year, but Congress delayed its approval. 
Now everything will depend on the next government. Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso decided to run this year because other 
center-left candidates dropped out of the race. 
  [CLARIN] Cardoso made an alliance with the right and is 
proposing a conservative-liberal policy. Can he really be 
considered a center-left candidate? 
  [Answer] Yes. He is a center-left candidate, like Felipe 
Gonzalez. Of course, of the modern center-right. If Cardoso 
wins, there will be a program to reform the social security 
system and the tax system. Tax collection responsibilities will 
be transferred to states and municipalities. 
  [CLARIN] Do you not think that many entrepreneurs are 
supporting Lula? 
  [Answer] Yes, those who are afraid of an economic opening. 
But Cardoso will not implement an indiscriminate opening 
policy. Jose Serra, the possible economy minister if Cardoso 
wins, supports the idea of an important state role promoting 
economic development. He does not believe that the market is a 
remedy for everything.
