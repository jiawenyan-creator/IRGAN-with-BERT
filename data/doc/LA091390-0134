SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SIERRA MADRE; 
LIMIT OF TERMS CONSIDERED 
Volunteers who serve on six City Council-appointed advisory boards may be 
limited to two terms under an ordinance the council will consider Sept. 25. 
Affected would be the planning, parks and recreation, cultural heritage and 
emergency services commissions; library board of trustees, and waste management 
task force/recycling committee. 
Members now may serve unlimited terms. At least four other cities in the San 
Gabriel Valley -- Alhambra, Arcadia, San Gabriel and South Pasadena -- limit 
commissioners' terms, City Manager James E. McRea said.
