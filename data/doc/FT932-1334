FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ofgas cautious on energy saving
UTILITY REGULATORS yesterday were cautious about the chances of
energy-efficiency measures at the heart of government plans for meeting
targets on global warming.
Sir James McKinnon, director general of Ofgas, the gas regulator, told the
Commons environment committee 'a lot of money' would be required if the
newly-formed Energy Saving Trust, set up to encourage households to save
energy, was to meet the targets.
The trust estimates that it would need to invest Pounds 400m a year in
household improvements by 1998 to make those savings. Sir James told the
committee that was 'at the top limit of what they might expect to get'. The
trust expects to spend only about Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m this year.
