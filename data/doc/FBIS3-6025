  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Agriculture Minister 
Eijiro Hata appealed to consumers on Monday [14 March] not to 
stockpile rice, assuring them that there will be no supply 
shortage. 
  Hata made the appeal at a meeting of rice dealers and 
consumers held by the Food Agency to hear views on imported rice. 
  Hata told the session there will be no shortage in rice 
supplies and said there is no need for consumers to rush to buy 
rice in excess. 
  Dealers and consumers asked the agency to bring down prices 
of imported rice and allow set sales of domestic and imported 
rice. 
  Hata said the government is not making it mandatory for rice 
dealers to blend domestic rice with imported rice in delivering 
to consumers. 
  Blending domestic and imported rice is simply an option, he 
said.
