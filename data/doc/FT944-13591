FT  27 OCT 94 / Canadian inflation to stay low
Canada's economic growth appears to be continuing at a vigorous pace, but
the underlying rate of inflation is expected to remain low, the Bank of
Canada said in its autumn review.
'Economic activity expanded at more than 5 per cent in the first half of the
year, and the economy appears to be continuing to grow at a vigorous pace,'
the bank said. 'It is estimated that, in spite of the rise in capacity
utilisation, the economy has room to expand at a growth rate above potential
for some time.'
The underlying rate of inflation had remained in the lower part of the
'inflation-control target band' and was expected to remain there, the bank
added. Excluding indirect taxes and movements in the food and energy
components, the 12-month inflation rate had remained at about 1.7 per cent,
the bank said, using data to September 23. Economic activity expanded at an
annualised rate of 6.4 per cent in the second quarter. 'Over the balance of
the year, output should grow at a solid, although somewhat slower, pace.'
