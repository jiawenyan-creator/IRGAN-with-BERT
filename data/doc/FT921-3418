FT  14 MAR 92 / International Company News: Air France takes stake in CSA
AIR France, the French state-owned airline, yesterday became the first
western carrier to buy a stake in an existing eastern European airline, when
it signed its alliance with CSA of Czechoslovakia, writes William Dawkins.
The French group has paid the equivalent of Dollars 60m for a 40 per cent
share in CSA.
The payment is being made equally by the London-based European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and an Air France subsidiary, itself
jointly owned with the Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the French state
financial institution.
A large part of Air France's own investment will be paid in kind, in the
form of technical and training help and the transfer of maintenance and
other tools.
