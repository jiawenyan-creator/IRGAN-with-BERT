FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: SWP edges ahead to Pounds 42,000
SWP Group recovered slightly in the six months to December with pre-tax
profits of Pounds 42,000, against a previous Pounds 31,000.
In the second half of the year to June 30 1992 the USM-quoted supplier of
components to the construction industry fell into losses.
Mr Robert Stickings, chairman, said trading conditions were extremely
depressed and the fall in the value of the pound had increased costs.
He added that there had been a modest increase in activity in recent weeks,
but prospects for the second half were still difficult to assess.
Turnover improved to Pounds 3.71m (Pounds 3.65m) for operating profits of
Pounds 126,000 (Pounds 98,000). Interest paid rose to Pounds 84,000 (Pounds
67,000).
Earnings per share were unchanged at 0.1p.
