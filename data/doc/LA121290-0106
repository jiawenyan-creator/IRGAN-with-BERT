BRIEFCASE: BANKING 
Tiny powerhouse: On the banking side, another trade publication recently named 
tiny Colonial Bank in Santa Ana as California's strongest bank. 
The Holt Advisory in West Palm Beach, Fla., based its decision on a variety of 
factors, including a formula it developed to determine a bank's soundness. 
Colonial's safety factor was rated A-minus, according to the publication. 
Colonial was created in 1987 to purchase the assets of the failed New City Bank 
in Orange. With $68.7 million in assets at the end of June and net income of 
$630,000 for the first nine months, Colonial hopes to expand its business 
banking activities under new management, said Robert P. Zingg, the bank's new 
president and chief executive.
