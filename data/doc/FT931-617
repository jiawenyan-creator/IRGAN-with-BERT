FT  29 MAR 93 / People: McClean: 'I just love newspapers'
Richard McClean, who is due to become chief executive of the International
Herald Tribune in July, had been planning to leave the newspaper industry
this summer.
The deputy chief executive of the Financial Times, who has worked at the
paper for 38 years, had decided to retire from the business, accept a number
of non-executive directorships and take on something entirely new.
But when he was approached by the co-chairmen of the international newspaper
 -Katherine Graham of the Washington Post and Arthur Ochs Sulzberger of the
New York Times - the temptation was too great.
'I just love newspapers. That's the problem,' says McClean, 55, who joined
the FT straight from school, selling advertising from the paper's Birmingham
office. Apart from two years in the Welsh Guards, he has worked on the paper
ever since.
He will succeed Lee Huebner, who has been publisher of the IHT since June
1979, and announced his intention to leave last September.
McClean was involved in the decision to turn the FT into an international
newspaper with overseas printing sites. He believes that the process should
continue; the IHT, he points out, is probably the most widely available
international newspaper. The owners of the IHT, the New York Times and the
Washington Post, he says, are 'outstanding publishers with extensive
financial resources and a strong commitment to high-quality publications'.
And as the deputy chief executive of the FT, newspapers at the top end of
the business are something he understands.
