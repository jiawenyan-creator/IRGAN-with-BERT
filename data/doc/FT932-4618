FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (6): Giants emerge to jostle for
position in world market - Paul Betts on how airlines are adapting to lower
traffic growth rates
THE AIRLINE industry is in a state of turmoil. 'All indications are that the
early 1990s will be remembered as perhaps the most critical period in the
industry's evolution,' says Mr Karl-Heinz Neumeister, the secretary general
of the Association of European Airlines.
Although traffic is now recovering after the slump caused by the combined
effects of the Gulf war and economic recession, many world airlines are
continuing to show heavy losses as they struggle to survive in an
increasingly competitive market.
Apart from the traffic slowdown - in 1991 airline traffic fell by 3 per cent
to show the first decline since the second world war - airlines have had to
adapt to a regulatory revolution which has seen liberalisation spreading
from America to Europe and in other regions of the world.
There are signs of a structural change in the traditional 'boom and bust'
cycle of the industry. Previous cyclical downturns have been followed by
sharp recoveries. In the current cycle, however, the pick-up has so far not
only been slow but has seen continued pressure on airline revenue yields.
While airlines have seen their lower yielding economy cabins filling up with
passengers again, first and business class traffic has remained sluggish.
Some airlines have reported drops of between 10 to 20 per cent in first and
business class passengers this year, while others say the trend of
passengers downgrading from first to business or from business to economy
class is continuing.
The capacity offered by airlines has also been outstripping passenger
demand, although International Air Transport Association figures suggest
that capacity is gradually becoming more balanced with demand in recent
months. But there are still about 800 aircraft lying idle in the Arizona
desert because of lack of demand, and the industry will remain under heavy
pressure until the excess capacity in the market is finally absorbed.
Overcapacity has fuelled fierce fare wars as carriers have attempted to fill
their seats and maintain market share at the expense of very poor financial
returns. As a result, the airline industry reported a heavy loss of around
Dollars 5bn on international scheduled services in 1992. Accumulated losses
during the past three years now total more than Dollars 10bn and the
industry is expected to show another big loss this year.
Both the airline industry and commercial aircraft manufacturers have been
revising downwards their estimates for long-term traffic growth, which will
be principally driven by real gains in gross domestic product in the
industrialised markets. They now expect overall traffic growth to average 5
to6 per cent a year in the 1990s. The Asia-Pacific region is likely to grow
most rapidly by about 10 per cent a year, while growth will be only around 4
per cent a year in the more mature European and North American markets.
But with traffic growth rates down from the high levels of the previous
decade and more competition, an increasing number of airlines are
struggling. One response has been to cut costs in an effort to improve
productivity. Nearly 50,000 jobs were lost in the industry in 1991 as a
result of restructuring. But this has not been sufficient and the past two
years have seen a number of airlines disappear, including famous names such
as Pan Am and Eastern and younger ones including Air Europe.
More structural adjustments will be necessary ifairlines are to survive in
the new world order. At the same time, the twin pressures of deregulation
and the increasing globalisation of the airline market are accelerating the
consolidation of the industry.
In the US, after more than 10 years of deregulation, the industry is already
heavily concentrated around a handful of giant carriers, with American
Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines the three largest. Although
these large carriers have also been hit by big losses and are cutting
capital expenditure, they continue to have their eyes firmly set on
international expansion in a drive to become global carriers.
In Europe, consolidation is now gathering momentum as airlines scramble to
forge strategic alliances and partnerships with other carriers to build up
their critical mass and compete in the global market.
British Airways has led the way by investing around Pounds 600m in the last
four months in a series of strategic stakes in other airlines including
USAir, Qantas of Australia, the regional French carrier TAT and a small
German airline called Delta. It has also taken over the loss-making
operations of Dan Air, the UK regional carrier based at London's Gatwick
airport, and of Plymouth-based Brymon.
BA has been able to take advantage of its financial strength and the
weakness of others to build this formidable set of global alliances. But
other European carriers are now also actively seeking to increase
co-operation links with other carriers to survive in the global market.
One of the most significant developments of recent months has been the
partnership discussions between four European medium-sized airlines -
Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines System, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and
Austrian Airlines - aimed at combining their operations under the umbrella
of a single jointly-owned company. Between them, the four carriers would
create Europe's biggest airline and what they call 'a fourth force' in the
European market to compete against the big three - British Airways, Air
France and Lufthansa.
Air France has also been increasing its mass by absorbing UTA, the French
independent long haul carrier, taking over Air Inter, the domestic French
airline, and acquiring a strategic equity stake in Sabena of Belgium. For
its part, Lufthansa is currently negotiating an alliance with American
Airlines and discussing partnerships with other carriers including Austrian
Airlines.
While jostling to position themselves in the global market, airlines
continue to be worried by the problems of congestion in the skies, because
of inadequate air traffic control systems, and on the ground, because of the
slow pace of new development at crowded airports. Both threaten to clip the
wings of growth when the recovery in air travel starts gathering steam. As
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, recently put it: 'The overriding
challenges we face are essentially two: the increasing level of deregulation
in the industry and the old chestnut of infrastructure.'
