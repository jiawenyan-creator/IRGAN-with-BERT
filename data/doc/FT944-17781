FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Grampian forced to lower sights - Cost
benefits from restructuring have not yet made an impact
Grampian Holdings, the Scottish mini-conglomerate, disappointed analysts
yesterday by failing to deliver any meaningful fruits from last year's
intensive restructuring.
Pre-tax profits rose 75 per cent to Pounds 3.59m (Pounds 2.05m) for the
half-year to July 1; however, the 1993 figures were depressed by a Pounds
1.22m exceptional loss from reorganisation costs. The shares fell 12p to
117p, as analysts' forecasts were cut by around Pounds 2m.
Mr Bill Hughes, chairman and chief executive, admitted that Grampian
over-estimated the speed with which cost benefits would come through from
the consolidation of its pharmaceuticals business into one core
manufacturing centre.
Mr Hughes said: 'Overall, we expect cost savings of Pounds 500,000 for the
full year.' Grampian estimates the division could achieve Pounds 1.25m of
savings per year by 1995.
The UK pharmaceuticals division experienced a 7 per cent fall in sales, with
margins falling because of fierce competition in the supply of intensive
farming products. However, overseas markets, particularly Germany and New
Zealand, strengthened. The division's profits fell from Pounds 3.29m to
Pounds 3.04m. Sporting goods reduced losses from Pounds 273,000 to Pounds
183,000 but the company has yet to benefit from royalty income from a new
licensing agreement at Patrick International.
Transport performed well, benefiting from moves into higher-margin logistics
operations. Profits grew from Pounds 1.32m to Pounds 1.55m. Retail
operations now comprise a 25 per cent stake in Edinburgh Woollen Mill, which
contributed a Pounds 181,000 loss against a Pounds 475,000 divisional loss
in 1993.
Group turnover from continuing operations fell from Pounds 58.6m to Pounds
56.3m. Net debt fell by around Pounds 3m to Pounds 38m. Mr Hughes expects
year-end gearing of 60 per cent (74 per cent), reflected in lower interest
costs of Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 1.89m).
The dividend is maintained at 1.7p against an increase in earnings per share
from 2.14p to 3.68p.
COMMENT
For a long time Grampian's full earnings recovery has been somewhere over
the rainbow, and the market appears to be running out of patience.
Management is now maintaining a cautious note and analysts are forecasting
profits of Pounds 9m to Pounds 9.5m against prior forecasts of Pounds 11m.
This leaves the shares on a p/e of 12.4, with all the hopes of recovery to
come. Grampian operates something of a ragbag of small businesses with
little strategic logic, but the current price offers value.
