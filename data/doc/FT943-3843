FT  12 SEP 94 / International Company News: Texaco bid to buy rest of
Canadian unit fails
Texaco has failed to buy out the minority shareholders in its Canadian
subsidiary, Texaco Canada Petroleum.
The US energy group's offer for the 22 per cent of the company it did not
already own was rejected by 84 per cent of the minority shareholders in a
vote on Friday.
It needed more than 50 per cent of holders to accept the Dollars 1.40 a
share offer to succeed. Texaco's failure followed a dispute over the
Canadian company's value.
Canadian 88 Energy, an independent company holding 9.8 per cent of the
shares, had offered to buy Texaco's shares in its subsidiary for Dollars
1.65 a share. But Texaco maintained its offer was fair and was based on the
advice of two independent financial advisers.
The rejection is a setback for Texaco ahead of its expected move to expand
its Canadian operations. The US company once had one of the biggest oil and
gas businesses in Canada, but sold the bulk for Dollars 5bn at the end of
the 1980s.
The attempt to buy out the minority shareholders was seen as a tidying-up
exercise ahead of renewed growth.
