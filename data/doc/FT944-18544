FT  03 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Fillip for Caribbean cross-border trade -
The Emerging Investor
Cross-border trading in the Caribbean, which has been sluggish since it
started in 1991, should get some encouragement from the decision of CIBC
(Canada), the commercial banking group, to offer for sale 45m shares in CIBC
West Indies Holdings, its Caribbean subsidiary.
The offer, which opened on Monday September 19, will close on Thursday
October 6, and is valued at Dollars 24.5m.
The hopes for increased cross-border trading have been raised by the
decision of CIBC to make the share offer simultaneously in six Caribbean
countries - Antigua, Barbados, Jamaica, St Lucia, St Vincent and Trinidad
and Tobago. The shares will be listed on the three Caribbean Community
(Caricom) stock exchanges in Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad. It is these
three which are at the core of the nascent regional stock market.
'This is a move in the right direction,' says Mr Wain Iton, manager of the
Jamaica Stock Exchange. 'It is the first genuinely regional public offer. We
may not get the robust cross-border trading that we all wish for, but it
sets the stage for other companies in the region to recognise that an entire
capital market in the region is available.'
This assessment is shared by Mr Hugh Edwards, manager of the Trinidad and
Tobago Stock Exchange. 'With CIBC coming to the market with an offer spread
out over six Caribbean countries,' he says, 'this should add some impetus to
the countries without stock exchanges to begin buying and selling shares.'
Cross-border trading is part of a wider effort by the members of the
Caribbean Community to integrate their economies and prepare the ground for
a planned common market and monetary union. 'This offer by CIBC will
certainly open the opportunities for other companies to try similar
placements simultaneously in several Caribbean states,' says Mr Basil Buck,
president of Buck Securities, Jamaican stockbrokers. 'There are many
companies which are well placed to do this, with subsidiaries and branches
in several Caribbean states.
'The CIBC offer will also stimulate the efforts at cross-border trading
which has been in the doldrums for many months,' adds Mr Buck.
Caribbean brokers have argued repeatedly that there is potential for vibrant
cross-border trading and the development of the regional stock exchange; the
three markets list an aggregate of 110 companies with a combined
capitalisation of Dollars 2.41bn.
They have also suggested that closer ties be established with the exchange
in the Dominican Republic. Guyana is planning to establish a stock market,
as is the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, a grouping of seven
islands with a common currency.
The offer by CIBC (Canada) represents about a quarter of the shares of its
Caribbean subsidiary, which is incorporated in Barbados and which is the
holding company for the bank's operations in Barbados and other islands in
the eastern Caribbean.
It also has a marginal majority stake in CIBC Jamaica and a 4 per cent
holding in Republic Bank, the largest in Trinidad and Tobago. CIBC's
Bahamian business is soon to be managed by CIBC West Indies Holdings.
'The Caribbean is a very thin market with a lot of cash and very little to
invest in,' says Mr Shastrie Ablack, managing director of CIBC West Indies
Holdings. A minimum sale volume of 30m shares will make the offer a
successful one, he adds.
Hopes for a more active cross-border market have been depressed by periods
of economic difficulty and uncertainty in some Caribbean economies. A very
volatile foreign exchange market in Jamaica, and high inflation which has
affected the financial services market (there is currently no activity in
the bond market), accompanied by currency instability, have compounded
changes in exchange rates in Trinidad and Tobago and rumours of an impending
devaluation in Barbados.
The majority of individual investors in Caribbean stocks, and some small
institutional ones as well, tend to use their shares as longer term
investments rather than looking for opportunities for buying and selling,
consequently reducing the vibrancy of the regional markets, according to
brokers.
'The success of this offer will determine the degree of vitality it will add
to cross-border trading, and there is at least one other company which is
watching this and which is likely to make an offer spread over a similar
area,' says Mr Edwards.
Regional investors in the CIBC West Indies Holdings offer will be able to
indulge in arbitrage on the secondary market by, for example, buying low in
Trinidad and selling high in Jamaica. Prices on the three markets may not
always be in balance.
The effort at cross-border trading is still bedevilled, however, by problems
in the manner and speed of settlements. Since none of the currencies used by
the three exchanges is convertible, settlements are being done through what
Mr Iton describes as 'a cost inefficient method.'
'We are settling in US dollars through a third party in New York,' he
explained. 'There is, however, the prospect of us using the network of one
of the regional banks.'
