FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bellsouth in Spanish venture
Bellsouth, the US tele-communications group, has added Spain to its
expanding European business by forming a local consortium to bid for a
second cellular phone licence to be awarded later this year by the Madrid
government.
The consortium, called Reditel, allies the US group to Repsol, the Spanish
state-controlled energy conglomerate, two construction companies and to
eight savings banks.
Bellsouth will have a 25 per cent stake in the venture and Repsol 15 per
cent.
Reditel is one of several alliances, mixing foreign operators with domestic
companies, formed in the past year ahead of the liberalisation of Spain's
telecommunications industry. Rival consortia seeking a mobile phone licence
include GTE of the US and the UK's Vodaphone.
The government is expected to publish the tender requirements for operating
digital service cellular telephones within the next two months. Two licences
are to be awarded, one of which will be reserved for Telefonica, which is 32
per cent state owned and is the monopoly telecommunications operator in
Spain.
A mobile phone service that is already operated by Telefonica, using 450MHz
and 900MHz cellular radio networks, is earning the Spanish group about
Pta12bn (Dollars 85.7m) in operating profit on a Pta100bn turnover.
Local analysts said Spain's cellular system could have 1.8m subscribers by
1998, compared with 254,000 at present.
'Our emphasis is on the cellular business but we will be looking closely at
other areas as they become available,' Mr George Von Open, Bellsouth's chief
executive in Spain said.
The US group participates in mobile services in Denmark, France in Germany
and is bidding, as part of a consortium, for an Italian licence.
