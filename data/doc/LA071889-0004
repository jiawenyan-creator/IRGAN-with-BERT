Syrian gunboats seized a ship carrying vegetables to the blockaded Christian 
enclave in Beirut and escorted it to the Syrian-controlled port of Tripoli in 
northern Lebanon, a spokesman for the Christians' army commander, Maj. Gen. 
Michel Aoun, said. He said the Syrians intercepted the ship about 15 miles off 
the Christian port of Juniyah. In Tel Aviv, meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Avihu Bin-Nun, 
commander of the Israeli air force, said Israel will not intervene to prevent 
Iraq from delivering short-range missiles to Christian forces in Lebanon.
