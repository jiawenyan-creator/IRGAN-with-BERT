FT  11 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: CBI's point on recovery
Sir, I did not state, as you report (February 10), that 'tax increases in
April will not harm the recovery'. What I said was 'tax increases in April
will not halt recovery' - quite a crucial difference.
I acknowledged that the economy might not grow as rapidly as it seems to
have done in the last quarter of 1993. But I also argued that analysis of
past large tax increases in 1967-68, 1973-74 and 1981-82 did not suggest a
slowdown in consumer spending was inevitable if the savings ratio fell.
Our forecast for 1994 envisages growth of 2.5 per cent, taking the impact of
the budget tax increases into account.
