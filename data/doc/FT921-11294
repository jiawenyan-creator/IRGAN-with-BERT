FT  01 FEB 92 / International Company News: Degussa slices payout after
heavy fall
DEGUSSA, the German metals, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals concern,
yesterday announced a sharp cut in dividend after a steep fall in profits
last year.
The company, which has embarked on an extensive restructuring and
cost-cutting programme, said it would be paying shareholders only DM7 a
share instead of the DM11 distributed previously.
Group net income dropped by 33 per cent, to DM99m (Dollars 62m), in the year
ended September 1991, with earnings per share tumbling to DM12 from DM25.50.
Several other German industrial companies, especially those involved with
export markets, have recently announced lower profits, dividend reductions,
and job cuts.
Degussa said in December its pre-tax profits were 44 per cent lower at
DM179m.
It blamed the world economic slowdown for the deterioration, and said an
expected improvement in the second half of the year had failed to occur.
Instead, business took a turn for the worse in the summer.
Turnover was only 4 per cent lower at DM13.4bn. However, like the previous
year, precious metals turnover - down by 13 per cent to DM3.8bn - was
excluded.
