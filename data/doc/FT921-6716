FT  26 FEB 92 / Urban regions' growth set to lag
A SHARP contrast between highly urbanised regions and the rest of the UK
will characterise economic growth in the 1990s, replacing the north-south
divide of the previous decade, according to a report published yesterday.
The report, by the Northern Ireland Economic Research Centre and Oxford
Economic Forecasting, predicted lower employment in the more urban regions
(Greater London, west Midlands and north-west England) in 1995 than in 1990,
with the largest fall in Greater London.
Scotland and Northern Ireland would be the slowest growing regions during
the 1990s, while East Anglia would continue to be the most buoyant.
The report said the northern half of the UK would grow at a broadly similar
rate to the southern regions.
The regions expected to lead in employment growth were the south-east
excluding Greater London, East Anglia, the south-west and the east Midlands,
followed by Wales, Yorkshire and Humberside.
