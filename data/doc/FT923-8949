FT  07 AUG 92 / County Hall row moves to High Court
THE CONTROVERSY over the future of London's County Hall reached the High
Court yesterday. Shirayama, the Japanese purchaser of the Thames-side
building, served a writ to overturn the government's decision to allow the
London School of Economics to bid for the site.
Shirayama is seeking judicial review of last month's instruction by Mr
Michael Howard, environment secretary, to the London Residuary Body, which
owns County Hall, not to proceed with the sale without his consent. The
order was to allow the LSE to submit a late bid, although the government had
earlier endorsed the Shirayama sale.
Having decided to allow the LSE to bid, Mr Howard was forced to issue a
formal order because the residuary body had made clear its unwillingness to
entertain a further bid.
The LSE last week submitted a bid of Pounds 65m for the entire County Hall
site. That is less than the Pounds 60m sale price to Shirayama for the main
riverside building alone, which it wishes to convert to a hotel. The LSE
argues that national-interest considerations justify its bid.
Mr Howard's action has infuriated Shirayama, which believes the government
has acted in bad faith. Its application for judicial review argues that the
order was grossly unreasonable, since the LSE's interest was evident at the
time of the sale in March.
It asserts that Mr Howard's actions have placed Shirayama in 'an invidious
commercial position' and have 'undermined' their plans for financing the
project. 'The uncertainty requires to be resolved urgently,' it says.
An opt-out clause gives the government until the end of November to withdraw
from the deal, but the London Residuary Body earlier this week 'strongly
urged' Mr Howard to reject the LSE bid and to delete the escape clause.
Sir Godfrey Taylor, LRB chairman, is angry at the government's action. His
view may carry some weight before the High Court.
