FT  13 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Record soyabean harvest
expected
The US Department of Agriculture boosted its estimate of this year's
soyabean harvest yesterday, saying it would be the largest ever.
The revised forecast of 2.316bn bushels was up from an August estimate of
2.282bn. The previous record was 2.261bn bushels in 1979.
The USDA also raised its prediction for the US maize crop to 9.257bn
bushels. It had previously forecast 9.214bn bushels.
Mr William Biedermann, an market analyst for the advisory firm Allendale,
Inc., said that projections for US maize production were likely to rise as
the harvest continued. 'Big crops get bigger,' he said.
Although the forecast for record production weighed on soyabean futures
prices at the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, maize prices were higher at
mid-session. 'The USDA expanded its figures for domestic and export use for
corn, so carry-over stocks don't rise,' said Mr Jerry Gidel, grain analyst
with Dean Witter Reynolds in Chicago.
Wheat prices also rallied as the USDA dropped its world carry-over figure to
119.4m tonnes, supporting traders' belief that the Australian wheat crop
would continue to deteriorate. As wheat prices rise, it becomes less
competitive with corn for animal feed.
