FT  22 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Hong Kong warrants from
SocGen
SOCIETE Generale, the French banking group, has launched an issue of
warrants on Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock index, the result of co-operation
between Societe Generale Equities &amp; Derivatives and Crosby Securities, the
Hong Kong-based stockbroking group in which the Societe Generale group has a
49 per cent stake.
The warrants are American-style, which means that they can be exercised at
any time during their life. There are two tranches, expiring in 13 months
and 19 months, both denominated in US dollars.
They include both put and call warrants, but Societe Generale is bullish on
the market and therefore recommends call warrants.
Crosby analysts are forecasting a rise of 27 per cent in the Hong Kong stock
market in the next 12 months, second only to Malaysia in the region.
