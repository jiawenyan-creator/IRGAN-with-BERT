  [Text] Hanover (DPA)--German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
has expressed his support for Lord David Owen, the mediator in 
the Yugoslavia conflict who has repeatedly been called on to 
resign. On the sidelines of a Free Democratic Party conference 
in Hanover today, Kinkel said the German Government was grateful 
to Owen for his "untiring efforts." It has great regard for 
Owen's commitment and his unremitting endeavors. His work did 
not deserve the current negative criticism. Kinkel added that 
in this immensely difficult and complicated situation, it is 
much easier to criticize than to do it better.
