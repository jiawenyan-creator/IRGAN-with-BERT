FT  27 JAN 93 / US may change Angola stance
THE Clinton administration is 'actively reviewing' US policy towards Angola,
and diplomats believe it could soon establish full diplomatic relations with
the Luanda government for the first time since the civil war that followed
independence from Portugal in 1975.
Mr Venacio da Moura, Angola's foreign minister, is expected to meet senior
State Department officials in Washington this week, although the precise
level of the meeting has not yet been arranged.
Under the Bush administration, US patience with its long-time ally, the
Unita resistance movement led by Mr Jonas Savimbi, was already wearing thin.
US officials were irritated by Mr Savimbi's refusal to accept the results of
last year's elections, which they viewed as broadly fair.
Democrats in Congress have never been as convinced as Republicans that Mr
Savimbi was a heroic fighter against communism, and the new administration
is expected to have few qualms about abandoning Unita. Indeed,
administration officials last week stiffly warned Mr Savimbi not to attack
US-owned oilfields in the province of Cabinda.
However, with peace talks between Unita and the MPLA-led government due to
begin in Ethiopia, the Clinton administration is expected to delay any
formal move to recognise the Luanda government.
