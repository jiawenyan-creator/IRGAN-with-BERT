MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO 
The Walt Disney animators are going to work on an ambitious new daily 
syndicated program that will hit the air in the fall of 1990. "The Disney 
Afternoon" will be two hours of original animated programming that will 
introduce "Tale Spin," a $30-million animated series built around an outrageous 
band of daredevil pilots, and also include the current-running "Duck Tales" and 
"Gummi Bears," plus an upcoming series, "Chip 'n' Dale Rescue Rangers." Richard 
Frank, president of Walt Disney Studios, says the $400,000-per-episode cost 
will make "Tale Spin" the most expensive animated series ever on television, 
topping Disney's "Duck Tales," which carries a $25-million-a-season price tag 
and currently is said to be the costliest animated series on TV. The syndicated 
package will be distributed by Buena Vista Television and will likely cost $100 
million a season to produce. Frank says the success of Disney brand products 
worldwide will pay for the expensive, hand-illustrated animation the company 
prefers. "We had to find ways to pay for this first," he added. Two days before 
Disney's announcement, movie director/producer Steven Spielberg said he is 
getting into television animation with "Tiny Tunes," a syndicated series slated 
to debut in the fall 1990 through Warner Bros. Television. ALEENE MacMINN
