THIS WEEK 
GET READY TO READ: This is Compton's Read to Celebrate Week, held in 
conjunction with Martin Luther King's birthday Jan. 15. 
Reading kits will be distributed at elementary schools and high school students 
will receive books donated by residents. Senior citizens will be honored for 
their part in the civil rights struggle at a program Wednesday afternoon at 
Dollarhide Neighborhood Center. Friday night, a King read-in will be held at 
the Compton Library, and on Saturday there will be a family festival with food 
and entertainment in King Plaza at City Hall. "Keep the Dream Alive," a banquet 
Sunday night at the Compton Lazben Hotel, will raise money for Rotary Club 
scholarships.
