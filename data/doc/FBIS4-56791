  [Text] A fee will be charged for the use of underground and 
surface water, through motors and other agricultural implements, 
by the cooperative and farming sector, as part of the measures 
to correct the national financial imbalance. 
  Orlando Lugo Fonte, president of the National Association of 
Small Farmers [ANAP], in a meeting with Villa Clara municipal 
ANAP representatives, clarified doubts and read part of the 
resolution issued by the Cuban Water Resources Institute. Lugo 
Fonte pointed out that the fee for the right to use the water 
will be determined case by case, and will be announced shortly 
in the monthly Farmer's Pride and Honor assemblies, which are 
redoubling their efforts against illegal sales of agricultural 
products.
