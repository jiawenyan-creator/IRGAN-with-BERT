FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (9): Group B - Russia
As the black market takes a grip on the economy and the Mafia flourishes,
Russia's chaotic World Cup preparations should not perhaps be too
surprising. As a result a nation which should have won the World Cup by now
will fail yet again in America.
Who could refuse such an opportunity to play in the World Cup? Well, rather
a lot of Russian players said: Niet, thank you very much'. Money is, of
course, at the centre of the controversy. Anatoly Byshovets, while coach of
the 1992 European Championship team, took the side of the players in a
dispute with the federation over bonuses. Byshovets was replaced by Pavel
Sadyrin. Sadyrin coached two unfashionable teams, CSKA Moscow and Zenit
Leningrad, to the old Soviet championship, but he is seen by the players as
a stooge of the federation. They want Byshovets back.
After qualifying for the finals, a group of the players signed an open
letter to the federation. Among the clauses about better training
facilities, a change of tactics and so on was one key demand: the return of
Byshovets. The federation, backed by President Boris Yeltsin, remained
unmoved. - The federation scored some successes, but three of the
foreign-based players stood firm. That is what makes this dispute unique. In
1974, the German players played a game of brinkmanship with their
federation, and won. The Dutch are past masters at it. Sadyrin excluded from
his squad Igor Shalimov, Internazionale's play maker, Andre Kanchelskis, of
Manchester United, and Karlsruhe's forward Sergei Kiriakov, Ivan Kolivanov
(Foggia) and Igor Dobrovolsky (Dynamo). - Russia has a huge reservoir of
talent. They will still put up a reputable performance, but to win the World
Cup you need all of your best players. Russia really should be contenders to
win the World Cup, but not this time.
