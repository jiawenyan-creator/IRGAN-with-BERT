BRIEFLY 
Walters Selling Newport Beach Home: Bill L. Walters -- the Denver developer and 
former business associate of Neil Bush who defaulted on $96 million in thrift 
loans and told Congress he was broke -- may be moving out of a $1.9-million 
home in Newport Beach. 
Real estate agents say the home -- owned by a trust for Walters' wife -- is now 
up for sale. It is listed with Prudential California Realty in Newport Beach. 
The house was the site of a citizens' demonstration Thursday night to protest 
the nation's S&amp;L crisis.
