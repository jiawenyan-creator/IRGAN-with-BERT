 



Downingia concolor

 var. 

brevior

 is a member of the bellflower family (Campanulaceae). This plant is a low, slightly succulent annual herb, with stems
5 to 20 centimeters (cm) (2 to 8 inches (in)) long. The flowers are blue and white with a 4-sided purple spot at the base
of the united petals. The fruit is 12 to 15 mm (0.5 in) long and the seeds have linear striations (lines). 

D. concolor

 var. 

brevior

 blooms from May to July and sets seed from June to August. The seeds are dispersed by flooding and require brief inundation
for germination (Munz 1974, Bauder 1992).



Downingia concolor

 var. 

brevior

 can be distinguished from the only other member of this genus that occurs in southern California, 

D. cuspidata

, by the form of the striations on the seed and by the color of the flower. It can be distinguished from the more northern


D. concolor

 var. 

concolor

 by the size of the fruit and how rapidly the fruit splits open when the seeds are mature (Ayers 1993).



Downingia concolor

 var. 

brevior

 is restricted to a single population at Cuyamaca Lake in the Cuyamaca Valley of San Diego County, California on land
owned by the Lake Cuyamaca Recreation and Park District. Historically, the population of 

D. concolor

 var. 

brevior

 was located throughout much of the valley floor. This population has now been largely restricted to the shore of the
lake, penetrating into the valley floor during dry years. From 1988 to 1992 one population existed in the vicinity
of Cuyamaca Lake, consisting of between 9 and 24 stands. Combined, these stands occupied less than 200 acres and frequently
occupied less than 100 acres. The number of individuals within these stands, and the location and size of these stands
vary in any given year in response to rainfall, the extent of winter flooding, and temperature (Bauder 1992).



Limnanthes gracilis

 ssp. 

parishii

 (Parish's meadowfoam) was first described by W.L. Jepson (1936) as 

Limnanthes versicolor

 var. parishii. The description was based on specimens collected by S.B. Parish at the Stonewall Mine on the southern
edge of the Cuyamaca Valley, San Diego County, California. Mason (1952) recognized 

L. versicolor

 var. 

parishii

 as 

L. gracilis

 var. 

parishii

, based on flower and fruit morphology. Beauchamp (1986b) elevated the plant to a subspecies based on consistency
with other treatments of this genus, and the geographic separation (over 1,200 kilometers (km) (800 miles (mi)) from


L.g.

 ssp. gracilis, which is found in southern Oregon.



Limnanthes gracilis

 ssp. 

parishii

 is a member of the meadowfoam family (Limnanthaceae), a small family of wetland species found primarily along the
Pacific coast of North America. The plant is a low, widely branching annual with stems 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 in) long. The
leaves are 2 to 6 cm (0.5 to 2 in) long and divided. The flowers are bowl-shaped, the petals are 8 to 10 mm (0.25 to 0.5 in)
long with a white or occasionally with a cream-colored base that becomes pink (Ornduff 1993). The fruit is rough textured.


L. gracilis

 ssp. 

parishii

 blooms from April through May, setting seed in the late spring and early summer. Germination requires saturated soils
or inundation (Munz 1974, Bauder 1992).

The range of 

Limnanthes gracilis

 ssp. 

parishii

 is separated by over 480 km (300 mi) from any other species of 

Limnanthes

. 

L.g.

 ssp. 

parishii

 is distinguished morphologically from 

L.g.

 ssp. 

gracilis

 by its smaller flowers, broader sepals, and smooth nutlets (Abrams 1951, Mason 1952).



Limnanthes gracilis

 ssp. 

parishii

 is restricted to moist montane meadows, mudflats, and along stream courses in the Palomar, Cuyamaca, and Laguna mountains
of San Diego County, California. Fewer than 20 populations of this taxon exist. The largest population occurs in the
Cuyamaca Valley in the vicinity of Cuyamaca Lake and Stonewall Creek and is restricted to the shore of Cuyamaca Lake
at maximum inundation. The majority of this population is on private lands but extends onto California State Parks
and Recreation lands.
