FT  10 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Call for stronger action on forest
destruction
Members of Europe's leading non-governmental organisations (NGOs) last night
met European environment ministers at the summit to call for stronger action
on forest destruction and a commitment to work towards a worldwide forest
convention, reports Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro.
Forests, are one of the most contentious issues of the summit, and there has
been little progress on bridging the north-south divide on the subject. With
only one day of working group discussions left it seems unlikely there will
be any agreement on deforestation which is continuing at a rate of 17m
hectares a year.
Mr Andrew Lees from Friends of the Earth said there was a danger the summit
was losing sight of vital environmental problems because so much was being
negotiated simultaneously in Rio. Forest devastation was continuing
'unhindered' in the meantime.
A convention had to be dropped long before the summit and replaced by a
non-binding declaration of forest principles which says little other than
that forests should be conserved and managed sustainably. Even this is
causing controversy at the conference with developing countries, led by
Malaysia, seeing it as an infringement of their sovereignty.
NGOs argue that the declaration is so weak as to be almost worthless
particularly as it includes no firm commitment to halt deforestation. The
NGO demands presented to ministers last night include a commitment to follow
up the principles with a legally binding instrument, and to allow
signatories to set up national policies against trade in unsustainable
forest products.
