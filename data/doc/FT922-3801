FT  09 JUN 92 / Letter (2): Time to decide how Europe might be better
managed
Sir, Rejecting European integration would be the worst economic disaster to
befall Ireland since the 1847 famine. But I deplore the rush to ignore the
Danish decision. Now that the Danes have inflicted a mortal legal blow to
Maastricht, the other member states have an opportunity to go back to the
drawing board and devise a loose bureaucratic system.
The EC leaders should heed concerns about the lack of democratic control
over EC decision-making, especially in regard to the eminence grise role
played by the Brussels Commission.
As a former Commission spokesman on agriculture, I am still amazed at the
inefficiency and lack of accountability which I observed at first hand. Nor
do I have much regard for the authoritarian approach of Mr Jacques Delors. I
also have grave doubts about the Commission's capacity to take on new
responsibilities under the Maastricht Treaty when it so badly manages its
present role.
The choice between EC mammon and democrat supervision of the EC institutions
is a real dilemma for many like myself in the Irish Maastricht referendum on
June 18. The over-reliance by Prime Minister Albert Reynolds on the economic
argument for an Irish yes vote, however valid in itself, does not do justice
to the other factors which need to be taken into account. One of these may
be a Perot factor.
