  [Excerpts] The chetniks continue to starve the population 
of the Bihac area by not allowing the passage of 20 convoys with 
humanitarian aid. Here is a report by our correspondent 
Fahrudin Bekcic: 
  [Begin Bekcic recording] Because of [words indistinct] 
aggressor's and Abdic's blockade of a part of the Velika Kladusa 
commune, the Bihac district has been in total humanitarian 
isolation since 17 May. The humanitarian aid convoys [word 
indistinct] Bosnia-Herzegovina were halted at the Turanj 
checkpoint near Karlovac, which is in Serbian hands. They would 
not allow passage to 20 convoys for Bihac, Cazin, Bosanska 
Krupa, and (?Buzim), even though this are convoys of the 
international humanitarian organizations. At the same time the 
humanitarian aid is passing for [words indistinct] Velika 
Kladusa without any problems. [passage omitted] 
  Instead of 15 kg, the residents of this region have been 
receiving only 7 kg of food per month. Now the situation is 
deteriorating rapidly. Food and other essentials are in short 
supply for nearly 300,000 residents of the Bihac district.
