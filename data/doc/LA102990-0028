ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
Even in callous Las Vegas, horseplayers wept after Go For Wand broke down in 
the Breeders' Cup Saturday. . . . 
What made things worse was NBC replaying the tragedy over and over and over 
again. It was sickening. . . . 
Go For Wand's death is a reminder that the most fragile of all athletes is the 
thoroughbred, a 1,000-pound animal racing as fast as 40 m.p.h. on spindly legs. 
. . . 
Not enough credit has been given the winner of the Distaff, Bayakoa, a 
remarkable mare who has won 16 of her last 21 races and two consecutive 
Breeders' Cups. . . . 
Unbridled won the two biggest races, the Kentucky Derby and the Breeders' Cup 
Classic, but horse-of-the-year honors should go to Criminal Type, who was more 
consistent and beat much better fields. . . . 
If Sprint runner-up Dayjur had jumped a shadow in his previous race, how come 
he wasn't wearing a shadow roll at Belmont Park?. . . . 
No wonder Chris McCarron didn't win a race. His mounts went off at odds of 
113-1, 17-1, 36-1 and 23-1. . . . 
Gary Stevens' ride on Turf winner In The Wings was as good as any all day. . . 
. 
What did Evander Holyfield prove Thursday night when he won the heavyweight 
title from Buster Mathis -- uh, Douglas -- in Las Vegas? He can jab. . . . 
"I left after the first round," ringsider Bill Cosby said. "Holyfield outjabbed 
Buster. I didn't need to see any more. The fight was over. The tip-off came 
when Buster entered the ring and his breasts bounced off his face." 
.. . . 
The trouble with Buster was that he hadn't eaten in almost eight minutes and 
was in a hurry to return to his dressing room for a snack. . . . 
Now it's easy to believe those reports that Douglas weighed 275 pounds when he 
finally got back into the gym after his upset of Mike Tyson. . . . 
Douglas joins Tim Witherspoon, Greg Page and Tony Tubbs on the list of recent 
heavyweight champions who came into the ring flabby for their first title 
defense and lost. . . . 
Winner-take-all is unrealistic, but maybe a percentage of the purse should go 
to the winner and a lesser amount to the loser. In boxing, champions have been 
guaranteed 20 times as much as challengers. But in tennis or golf, being the 
defending champion assures you of nothing except a spot in the field. . . . 
Second best-conditioned heavyweight on the card Thursday was Riddick Bowe. . . 
. 
Look-alikes: Holyfield and former New York Giant linebacker Harry Carson. . . . 
British promoter Mickey Duff on Holyfield-George Foreman: "It will be a tough 
fight for five rounds. Then youth will prevail.". . . . 
Holyfield opened as a 5-1 favorite over Foreman at one Las Vegas betting parlor 
and 3 1/2-1 at another. . . . 
If Holyfield had lost to Douglas, he would have been guaranteed $3 million and 
Foreman $4 million for a non-title match. Instead, Holyfield will get $20 
million and Foreman $12 million. . . . 
All three fights at the Mirage have been stinkers -- 
Holyfield-Douglas, Michael Nunn-Marlon Starling and Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto 
Duran. . . . 
The rematch of a great fight, Julio Cesar Chavez-Meldrick Taylor, is set for 
February. No title will be at stake and the weight will be 144 pounds, four 
over the junior-welterweight limit. . . . 
Name game: Junior-middleweight boxer Kenneth Whack. . . . 
That increase in box seat ticket prices at Dodger Stadium should help Peter 
O'Malley pay Darryl Strawberry. . . . 
Because of the body of his work, Todd Marinovich deserves to get his starting 
quarterback job back at USC if his classroom attendance picks up. . . . 
Washington is playing the finest college football in the nation. . . . 
Michigan is the best 4-3 team. . . . 
Lou Holtz doesn't give Raghib Ismail enough to do. The Rocket takes off from 
the line of scrimmage faster than maybe anybody ever. . . . 
Stanford's upset of Notre Dame becomes more incredible every week. . . . 
Yeah, Pat Dye would have gone for the tie if Auburn had been in the same 
situation as Mississippi State Saturday. . . . 
The improved Miami Dolphins now can win easily even on days when Dan Marino 
throws only one touchdown pass. . . . 
Think New Orleans' offense is conservative enough? Steve Walsh completed 19 
passes for a grand total of 120 yards against Detroit. . . . 
Sunday wasn't quite the same without the Raiders. . . . 
From Jerry Tarkanian, coach of NCAA basketball champion Nevada Las Vegas: "We 
got H Waldman and if we would have gotten Shon Tarver, we would have had two 
honor students in the backcourt. I don't know if I could have related to them."
