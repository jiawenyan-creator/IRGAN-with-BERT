SHOEMAKER TO RIDE PATCHY GROUNDFOG 
Bill Shoemaker will ride Patchy Groundfog Saturday at Santa Anita in the final 
race of his career. 
The 58-year-old Shoemaker, who has won a world record 8,833 races, will make 
his 40,350th start in the $100,000-added Legend's Last Ride, a one-time-only 
stakes over one mile on the grass, to be televised nationally. 
Patchy Groundfog worked three-eighths of a mile in 35 seconds under Shoemaker 
this morning, and afterwards the jockey he would ride the 7-year-old chestnut 
horse Saturday. 
Official entries for the race will be taken Thursday. Shoemaker also will chose 
two alternates.
