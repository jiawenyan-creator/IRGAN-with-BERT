FT  14 MAY 93 / Taipei to constrain mainland investment
THE TAIWANESE government is seeking to slow the island's rapid corporate
expansion into the Communist mainland by placing restrictions on listed
companies' activities in China.
This is Taipei's first move to constrain investment flows across the Taiwan
straits since it lifted travel restrictions in 1987.
Under current regulations, Taiwanese companies are permitted to invest in a
large number of mainstream business activities in China, but only via a
third country.
However, the Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC), which regulates the
Taipei stock market, yesterday announced it will prohibit companies from
raising capital on the stock market to fund China projects. Listed companies
will also be required to gain shareholders' approval for any investments in
the mainland.
The SEC said the decision was in line with current government policy.
However, brokers said it would have a very limited effect on listed
companies, which can easily restructure financing for China projects. It is
estimated that close to 20 per cent of the Taipei stock market's 260
companies have already announced investments in China.
The government estimates that around 4,000 of the island's companies have
invested USDollars 3.5bn in China, while unofficial estimates suggest the
figure is more than USDollars 7bn.
Given the strengthened economic links between the two enemies, there has
been increasing pressure from Taiwan's business community to lift
prohibitions on direct transport, investment and postal links across the
Taiwan straits. Last month, China raised the issue of the 'three links',
when the two sides met for the first time since 1949 at the Koo-Wang talks
in Singapore. But Taiwan remains anxious to retain what a government
spokesman admitted was a 'political pawn'.
