ATHLETE OF THE WEEK 
Kwinn Knight's parents must have known they had something special when they 
slipped a win into the spelling of his name. 
He's never the biggest guy on the field. He's never the fastest, either. Yet no 
Ventura County high school football player has ever found the end zone as often 
in a single season as Knight. 
Santa Clara High's 37-20 victory over Temecula Valley last week in a Southern 
Section Division VIII quarterfinal was a typical Knight night. 
The 5-foot-9, 165-pound senior tailback scored three touchdowns to give him 31 
for the season. Knight knifed nine yards up the middle for his first score, 
which gave Santa Clara a 7-6 lead in the second quarter. A one-yard Knight run 
in the third quarter gave the Saints an insurmountable 27-6 advantage and he 
added the team's final touchdown on a 12-yard run. 
This season, Knight has rushed for 21 touchdowns, caught six touchdown passes 
and returned four kicks for touchdowns. He also has four two-point conversions 
to give him 194 points. 
Temecula Valley was braced to contain the passing of Santa Clara quarterback 
Tim Gutierrez, which allowed Knight to spring free for 133 rushing yards. He 
added three receptions for 33 yards. 
Knight, who also plays basketball and baseball, is Santa Clara's second-leading 
receiver with 59 catches for 611 yards. He has rushed for a team-high 882 yards 
in 134 carries, an average of 6.6 yards a carry. 
All of which has converted Coach Larry Lawrence into a Knight person. 
"He's a tough little competitor," Lawrence said. "He does a little bit of 
everything for us." 
Including a lot of scoring. STEVE HENSON
