ACTION:

 Notification of commercial quota increase and commercial quota availability. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this document to announce an increase in the commercial quota for the 1994 summer flounder fishery. The
intent of this document is to comply with an Opinion and Order issued by District Court Judge Robert Doumar, directing
NMFS to reset the quota equal to 19.05 million lb (8.6 million kg). This document advises the public that a quota adjustment
has been made and informs the public of revisions to state quotas necessitated by this adjustment. As a result of this
action, vessels issued a Federal fisheries permit for the summer flounder fishery may resume landing summer flounder
in the State of Delaware until the 1994 quota is harvested.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Regulations implementing the Summer Flounder Fishery Management Plan (FMP) are found at 50 CFR part 625. The regulations
require NMFS annually to establish and apportion among the coastal states from Maine to North Carolina a commercial
quota for summer flounder. The process required to set the annual commercial quota and the percent allocated to each
state is described in 50 CFR 625.20. The commercial summer flounder quota for the 1994 calendar year, adopted pursuant
to these regulations, was initially set to equal 16,005,560 lb (7.3 million kg) (59 FR 10586, March 7, 1994). 


In a decision filed November 4, 1994, in the Norfolk Division of the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Virginia, Judge Robert Doumar ordered NMFS to increase the commercial quota to 19.05 million lb (8.6 million kg).

Section 625.20(d)(1) of 50 CFR requires that the annual quota (as ordered increased) be distributed to the coastal
states according to specified percentages. Section 625.20(d)(2) requires that any state which had landings in excess
of the state's quota in 1993 have its 1994 allocation adjusted by deducting the 1993 excess. This adjustment was made
to the initial 1994 quotas in a document published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 25, 1994 (59 FR 26971). These overages are likewise deducted from the Court-ordered quota in Table 1 below. 
Section 625.20(f) allows a state to transfer all or a portion of its commercial quota. The States of Connecticut, Maryland,
North Carolina, and the Commonwealth of Virginia made transfers to the State of Delaware, which were effective June
1, 1994 (59 FR 29207, June 6, 1994). The State of New Jersey made a transfer to the State of Connecticut, which was effective
September 29, 1994 (59 FR 50512, October 4, 1994). These transfers are reflected in Table 1 below.
Table 1 shows the allocation to each state of the court-ordered new quota, the 1993 overage amounts to be deducted,
the quota transfers made by the states, and the resulting final state quotas.

As a result of this quota adjustment, the previous closure document effective March 30, 1994 (59 FR 15863, April 5,
1994) is rescinded and vessels may again land summer flounder in Delaware, until the available 1994 quota is harvested.
The Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council has submitted to NMFS a recommended summer flounder coastwide quota
for 1995 of 19.4 million pounds (8.8 million kg). This recommendation did not account for the possible increase in
mortality that could occur from this upward adjustment of the quota in response to the Court Order. Consequently,
a re-examination of the factors in section 625.20 that must be considered in setting the annual quota will have to be
undertaken to assess what quota level in 1995 will assure attainment of the fishing mortality reduction goal of 0.53.
If the adjusted quota in 1994 is completely harvested, the current recommended quota for 1995 will have to be adjusted
downward.
