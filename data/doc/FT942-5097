FT  07 JUN 94 / Schneider cash transfers probed
Officials from Germany's federal criminal police office and the Frankfurt
state prosecutors' office will today start conducting inquiries in Geneva
into money transfers made by Mr Jurgen Schneider, the businessman whose
disappearance in March triggered Germany's biggest property collapse since
the second world war. The prosecutors' office said yesterday it suspected Mr
Schneider of transferring DM245m (Pounds 98m) of Schneider group cash out of
Germany during March at a time when the group's liquidity problems were
mounting. The money is believed to have been transferred via London to
Nassau in the Bahamas before ending up in Geneva. As a result, said the
prosecutor's office, the fugitive businessman was under suspicion of
conducting 'fraudulent bankruptcy on a massive scale'. He already faces
charges of tax evasion and fraud. The Schneider group collapsed in April
owing more than DM5bn. Despite several reported sightings, his whereabouts
are still unknown.
