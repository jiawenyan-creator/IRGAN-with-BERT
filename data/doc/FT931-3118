FT  17 MAR 93 / Sharp fall in days lost by strikes
WORKING time lost in Britain through disputes and stoppages has fallen
sharply, according to figures from the EC's statistical office in
Luxembourg.
Only 34 days were lost per 1,000 employees in 1991 compared with 83 in 1990
and 1,278 in 1984.
Days lost between 1987-91 average 126 per 1,000 employees - a 70 per cent
drop compared with the period from 1982 to 86 when Britain had one of the
worst records for strikes in the Community.
