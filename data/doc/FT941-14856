FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: French new towns plan bond issue
Nine of France's post-war 'new towns' plan to join forces and issue FFr2-3bn
worth of bonds later this year to refinance high-cost bank debt.
The move would mark the first real entry into the international capital
markets for the new towns, set up in the last 20 years chiefly around Paris
but also near Lyon, Marseilles and Lille.
Mr Jacques Guyard, mayor of Evry and president of the Association of Leaders
of the New Towns, said yesterday that in addition to the bond issues, the
new municipalities wanted to diversify their annual borrowing of FFr8-900m
in order to get better rates.
Some German savings banks had already shown interest in lending to France's
new towns, and Mr Guyard hoped that other foreign institutions would follow.
Over the past 15 years, the new towns have amassed debt of FFr11bn (Dollars
1.88bn), which costs on average one-third of their annual budgets.
The newly-privatised Credit Local de France has virtually been the monopoly
lender to the new towns.
Mr Guyard said that to attract international investors and lenders, 'we
might form ourselves into a mutual organisation, or perhaps we might sign
separate contracts negotiated together'.
