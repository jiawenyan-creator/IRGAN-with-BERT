SCHOOL DISTRICT WARNS TEACHERS OF MAJOR LAYOFFS 
The East St. Louis school board is warning half of its 1,800 employees of 
possible layoffs in a cost-cutting move that should save the district $11 
million in the next fiscal year. 
Despite the savings, the district will still have debts totaling more than $17 
million. 
The district sent layoff notices last week to 390 teachers and 515 
non-certified employees, everyone hired since Jan. 1, 1974. 
Superintendent Elmo Bush said he hopes to reduce the eventual number of 
layoffs, through such means as attrition, to 280 teachers and 300 to 400 
non-certified workers. 
East St. Louis, the state's fourth-largest district with 16,000 students, has a 
$70-million budget.
