BRIEFLY 
T-bill Rates Dip: The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion of new three-month 
bills at an average discount rate of 8.65%, down from 8.73% last week. Another 
$7.2 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 
8.66%, down from 8.77% last week. The new discount rates understate the actual 
return to investors -- 8.97% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,781.30, and 9.18% for a six-month bill selling for $9,562.20. The 
discount rate reflects the price discount received when government securities 
are purchased at less than face value.
