THE INSTITUTE of Financial Planning, which promotes professional, fee-based
financial advice, has launched its first financial planning examination.
Successful applicants can use the exam as the final step towards gaining
associate membership of the IFP (becoming an AIFP).
In future, consumers will know that anyone with these letters after their
name has passed two three-hour 'open book' written examinations, working on
case studies of fictitious people and business situations.
The range of the syllabus is broad, including banking, cash investments,
credit and mortgages, tax planning, pensions, annuities, trusts, and types
of investment for both lump sums and regular savings, including investment
planning. Candidates will also need to be able to write reports and use
financial calculators.
