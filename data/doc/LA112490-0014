VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY; 
WATER COMPANY TO RAISE RATES BY 5% 
The Southern California Water Co. has won approval to increase rates in the 
Simi Valley District by 5%, beginning Jan. 1. 
The state Public Utilities Commission this week authorized the rate increase 
for the company, which serves about 12,000 residents in and near Simi Valley. 
On the average, customers will have to pay about $1.26 more each month, company 
officials said. The typical customer now pays $24.54 for 2,170 cubic feet of 
water a month. 
Company officials said the rates were increased to pay for the rising cost of 
the water. 
The city's other water purveyor, Calleguas Municipal Water District, serves 
most of the city's 100,000 residents. CARLOS V. LOZANO
