  [Text] Cairo, 16 Apr (MENA)--Asyut Governor Samih al-Sa'id 
has announced that popular committees this morning handed over 
to the Asyut security service 16 extremists who repented after 
being misled by fugitive extremist leaders who deceived them 
into believing that they were fighting for religion. 
  The governor added that the security services will release 
these persons after authenticating their repentance. He 
affirmed that current popular efforts all over the governorate 
will help wipe out fugitive terrorists and those involved in 
murder, sabotage, and hostile activities now that the help they 
used to receive from these people has stopped.
