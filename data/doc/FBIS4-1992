  [Text] Beijing, 1 Apr (XINHUA) --According to the latest 
information from China's rural social economic investigation 
team, on the basis of witnessing a slight increase in the income 
of peasant households, the living standards of peasants in China 
also improved by a large margin in 1993, the average per capita 
expenditure of peasants on living expenses was 778.7 yuan, an 
increase of 119.7 yuan, or 18.2 percent, over the 1992. If the 
rise of prices was factored in, the actual increase was 3.9 
percent. 
  Based on a sample survey among 67,000 peasant households in 
29 provinces, in 1993, the money which Chinese peasants spent on 
food increased by 19 percent over 1992 and reached 451.4 yuan. 
If the rise of prices was factored in, the actual increase was 
6.2 percent. The expenses on grain, pork, poultry, and eggs all 
increased to some extent. 
  The increase in the expenditure on clothing was not so rapid 
as the increase in the expenditure on foods. The expenditure on 
clothing increased by 5.4 percent and reached 55.3 yuan, showing 
an actual increase of 1.6 percent over 1992. Of this, the 
expenditure on cotton clothing declined by 10 percent and that 
of chemical fabrics increased by 9.5 percent. 
  Since 1990, the craze in building houses has slowed down 
every year. In 1993, peasants' spending on housing noticeably 
declined, and each peasant spent an average of 56.6 yuan in 
housing, a decline of 16.9 percent from the previous year, thus 
marking the biggest decline in the spending on housing during 
recent years. In this connection, the number of new houses 
built by rural residents during 1993 decreased by 7.3 percent 
from 1992. 
  A sharp contract to the slowdown in the housing craze was 
that peasants' expenditure on buying household equipment and 
daily necessities increased quite rapidly. In 1993, the average 
per-capita expenditure of rural residents on buying household 
equipment and daily necessities was 44.9 yuan, an increase of 
8.2 yuan, or 22.5 percent, over 1992, and the actual increase 
was 14.7 percent. Judging from the purchasing volume, the 
increase in the purchase of refrigerators, sewing machines, and 
washing machines was quite rapid. 
  In addition, the average per capita expenditure of peasants 
on medical treatment and health care, communications and 
telecommunications, and cultural and recreational articles 
increased to a fairly great extent, and reached 27.4 yuan, 17.5 
yuan, and 58.9 yuan respectively, or an increase of 13.6 
percent, 43.1 percent, and 34.6 percent respectively over 1992. 
In this way, the living expenses of peasants in China in 1993 
were arranged in the order of foods, housing, education, 
clothing, household equipment and daily necessities, medical 
treatment, communications, and others. 
  Specialists from relevant departments have reminded us that 
we should notice the gap between the expenditures of rural 
residents on consumption and that of urban residents, and that 
the radio between them has reached 1:2.7. In addition, there is 
also a fairly big gap between the degree of improvement in the 
living standards of peasants in different localities.
