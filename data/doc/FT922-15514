FT  01 APR 92 / Letter: More in the cabinet
Sir, David Marsh's report, 'True Blue shires' (March 28), is wrong. John
Biffen is not the only member of Mrs Thatcher's 1979 cabinet standing for
re-election.
What about Michael Heseltine and David Howell?
Michael Jopling and Norman Fowler were also 'invited to attend' the 1979
cabinet, although not full members at the outset.

parliamentary candidate,
