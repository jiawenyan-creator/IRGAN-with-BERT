  [Text] The remains of at least 60 human beings were found 
today in a mass grave in Landazuri Municipality, Santander 
Department. It is believed that the corpses have been there 
anywhere between two to five years. 
  There is already speculation as to why they are there. Some 
versions say it is the result of accounts settled among poppy 
growers. Other say the deaths was due to executions by 
guerrillas. 
  Amid five hectares of poppy plantations in the place known 
as 
El Roble Heights, in Landazuri Municipality in Santander 
Department, troops of the Rafael Reyes Infantry Battalion found 
a mass grave with the remains of at least 60 people buried some 
time within the past five years. According to the Army, they 
are all FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] 
guerrillas, and many of the victims have bullet wounds. 
  The "National" newscast has learned that apparently the 60 
murdered guerrillas could be the product of executions among the 
rebels because of disloyalty. The executions may have been 
ordered by Braulio Herrera, former representative to the chamber 
by the UP [Patriotic Union], when he was the fourth-ranking FARC 
commander. 
  For this deed, the former congressman was sentenced to death 
by the guerrilla command, but he was able to leave the country 
illegally. 
  However, the authorities of the Landazuri municipality 
believe the corpses found there could be the result of a war 
among poppy growers of the region. 
  In the town today there is an atmosphere of mourning and 
anxiety because never before had such serious deeds been 
registered in the jurisdiction.
