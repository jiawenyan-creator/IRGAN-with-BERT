To delight family and friends with something a little different, try a 
stove-top pizza. Serve it as a main course or as an appetizer. 
STOVE-TOP PIZZAS 
1 cup semolina flour 
Parmesan cheese 
1 teaspoon baking powder 
2 teaspoons dried oregano, crumbled 
Extra virgin olive oil 
1/3 cup hot water 
1 cup tomato sauce, fresh or bottled 
8 ounces mozzarella, cubed 
1/3 cup minced fresh basil 
Combine flour, 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, baking powder, oregano, 1 
tablespoon olive oil and hot water in food processor. Process into firm, smooth 
dough. 
Shape into ball and cover with plastic wrap. Let stand 30 minutes before 
cooking. 
Roll pizza dough with hands on flat surface into log about 6 inches long. Cut 
into 4 equal pieces. Roll out each piece into round about 7 inches in diameter. 
Heat cast iron skillet over low flame. Place 1 dough round in skillet and cook 
until bottom has browned, about 3 minutes. Check often to prevent burning. 
Remove from skillet and brush browned side with olive oil. Spoon 1/4 of tomato 
sauce on top, and distribute 1/4 of mozzarella, basil and 1/4 cup grated 
Parmesan cheese over sauce. 
Return pizza to skillet, cover and cook until cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes. 
Repeat with other rounds. Makes 4 main course or 8 appetizer servings.
