FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Perstorp surges 66% to SKr551m
for year
Perstorp, the Swedish specialty chemicals and plastics group, yesterday
reported a 66 per cent jump in profits after financial items, to SKr551m
(Dollars 73.1m) in the year to the end of August, compared with SKr331m last
time.
The improvement was attributed mainly to the benefits of investment in new
products and new markets.
Mr Gosta Wiking, chief executive, said the group anticipated a further
improvement in the current September-August fiscal year, in spite of rising
raw material prices in the early stages.
He said the return from investments, favourable market conditions in North
America and Asia, and an upturn in Europe were all having a positive impact.
Sales in the full year rose 21 per cent to SKr10.3bn from SKr8.6bn last
time. Operating profits before depreciation reached a record SKr1.2bn, up
from SKr930m.
Perstorp said sales improved in all its six divisions.
