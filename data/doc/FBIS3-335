  [Excerpt] Nairobi, 4 Mar (KNA) -- The national organizing 
officer of KANU [Kenya African National Union] Mr. Japheth Kiti 
denied press reports that KANU was meddling with the multiparty 
election in Malawi, saying that all that KANU was doing was 
responding to requests by Malawi Congress Party (MCP) on how 
best to win the elections. 
  Mr. Kiti, who was receiving nine defectors from opposition 
parties at KANU headquarters today, said that it was due to the 
cordial relationship between KANU and MCP over the years that 
KANU had agreed to respond to the Malawi Congress Party's 
request. [passage omitted]
