Alignment



On June 1, 1994, in accordance with section 705(a)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act) (19 U.S.C. 1671d(a)(1)),
petitioner in the above-referenced investigations requested that we align the due date for the final countervailing
duty determinations with that of the final antidumping duty determinations for certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe
fittings from India and Israel. Accordingly, we are aligning these final determinations. Therefore, the final countervailing
duty determinations are due no later than October 24, 1994.

The U.S. International Trade Commission is being advised of this alignment, in accordance with section 705(d) of
the Act.
