FT  27 MAY 94 / OFT probes bus service rivalries
Fierce rivalries between bus companies prompted the competition authorities
to intervene in Darlington and Kent yesterday.
The Office of Fair Trading has begun an investigation into United Automobile
Services of Darlington after a complaint from Your Bus that United was
running uneconomic services to force its rival to withdraw its services.
The probe is expected to take six months.
In Kent, meanwhile, Maidstone &amp; District Motor Services and its parent
company, Einkhorn, face the threat of proceedings after failing to give the
OFT satisfactory undertakings about bus services.
Mr Neil Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister, said he was considering
issuing an order after a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report found that
Maidstone was operating a monopoly against the public interest in mid and
west Kent.
Mr Hamilton said the order might require M&amp;D to give its competitors access
to Pentagon bus station in Maidstone, to maintain services and fares
introduced in response to competing services after these had been withdrawn,
and to rescind selective reductions in fares on journeys which preceded or
followed those of a competitor.
