FT  14 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Invesco MIM to manage
Japanese fund
INVESCO MIM Asset Manage-ment, the Japanese arm of the UK asset management
group, has been named by Nagasakiya, a leading Japanese retail company, to
manage a portion of its pension funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Invesco MIM will become the first foreign-based company to manage the
pension funds of a single private Japanese company. The move comes at a time
when the Japanese pension fund market is expected to grow quickly because of
the country's rapidly-ageing population.
Nagasakiya said it respected Invesco MIM's investment philosophy and
management ability. It added that the appointment would diversify its
investments internationally since foreign asset management companies were
permitted to invest up to 70 per cent of assets overseas, compared with 50
per cent for domestic asset managers.
Nagasakiya's move reflects the company's performance-conscious investment
stance. Nagasakiya's pension assets, expected to total Y23.7bn by the end of
this March, are currently managed by three Japanese trust banks and two
domestic life insurance companies.
Nagasakiya said the returns on investments by the trust banks were
unsatisfactory, and it had decided to alot Y1bn of its fund to Invesco MIM.
