BUSH, IN COSTA RICA, SEES SWEEP OF DEMOCRACY 
President Bush hailed "the sweep of democracy through the hemisphere" as he 
joined Latin American leaders today for talks about drug trafficking, foreign 
debt and political strife. 
Even before Bush's arrival from Washington for a two-day celebration of Costa 
Rica's 100 years of democracy, Panama's military government was sniping at the 
United States from afar, and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega was castigating 
Bush for refusing to meet with him. 
Bush did not mention either Panama or Nicaragua when he stepped off his plane 
but he won applause at a welcoming ceremony when he declared: "I believe we can 
create here in the Americas the world's first completely democratic 
hemisphere." 
Ortega sat at least half a dozen seats away from Bush as the 17 hemispheric 
leaders began their first working session this afternoon at a resort hotel 
outside San Jose. Each was introduced to rounds of applause, and their 
deliberations at a long table were broadcast live on national television. 
At the airport, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez announced a tentative 
agreement that will allow his country to reduce its $4.5-billion foreign debt 
burden by $1 billion. He said the agreement would reduce debt service by 
two-thirds. 
Arias gave no further details but profusely thanked the United States for its 
help in achieving "the best gift we could possibly make to future generations 
of Costa Ricans." 
Bush and Arias shook hands and then embraced each other with hearty hugs. 
Arriving ahead of Bush, Ortega told reporters that he hopes the meeting will be 
the first step toward talks between North and South America. "Without 
confronting the problems of the economy, commerce and the rights of nations to 
live in peace, democracy is at risk throughout Central America," Ortega said. 
Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega wasn't invited to the summit. But 
in advertisements placed in San Jose's major newspapers, provisional Panamanian 
President Francisco Rodriguez told the leaders that democracy in Panama 
couldn't be considered without also discussing U.S. economic and political 
pressure.
