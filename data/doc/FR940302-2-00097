SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

As a result of the fatal barge/railroad bridge accident near Mobile, Alabama on September 22, 1993, the Secretary
of Transportation directed the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to review the circumstances
surrounding the accident, and undertake initiatives to minimize the risk of any similar tragedy in the future. Therefore,
the Coast Guard commissioned a study to review marine safety issues related to uninspected towing vessels and recommend
ways to increase safety and minimize further risk of future accidents.



The study includes the Coast Guard's marine casualty statistics for towing vessels, over a twelve year period (19801991).
Correlations are drawn from towing vessel casualties based on the area of operation, gross tonnage and horsepower.
As a result, the Study group made 19 recommendations based on five major areas: (1) Requirements for Licensing for
Operator of Uninspected Towing Vessel; (2) Requirements for Reporting Marine Casualties and Hazardous Conditions;
(3) Bridge Fendering Systems and Navigational Lighting; (4) Adequacy of the Navigation Equipment for Uninspected
Towing Vessels; (5) and, Adequacy of the Aids to Navigation System for Marking the Approaches to Bridges Over Navigable
Waterways.

Conclusions drawn from towing vessel casualty statistics indicate the majority of personnel and vessel casualties
involving uninspected towing vessels are directly attributable to human error. As a result, 10 of the 19 recommendations
surround the qualifications, training and issuance of an operator of uninspected towing vessel license.

Legislation has been introduced in Congress that would mandate implementation of some of the study recommendations,
including enhanced licensing requirements and requirements for navigational equipment.

The Coast Guard will hold a public meeting on April 4, 1994 to review the study and seek public comment on the recommendations
identified in the study. The study, along with public comment may be used to develop future rulemaking projects. Of
particular interest, and likely to be the subject of expedited rulemaking, are actions which could provide the necessary
means and improve the navigational ability of the operator, including requiring charts, publications and a radar
system, and requiring the operator to be qualified as a radar observer. Comments on the practical utility of these
requirements for various classes or sizes of vessels or areas of operation, the costs involved, and the length of time
appropriate for implementation would be especially helpful.

The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to submit written data, views, or arguments. Persons submitting comments
should include their names and addresses, identify the study by Docket number CGD 94014 and give the reason
for each comment. Each person wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed
postcard or envelope.
