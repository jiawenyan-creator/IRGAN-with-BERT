ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 
HERMANDAD PROTESTS COUNCIL FUND DENIAL 
About 200 people from the Latino rights group Hermandad Mexicana Nacional 
demonstrated against the City Council Monday night after it refused to award 
any federal funds to a nonprofit organization that wanted $1.4 million to build 
a police substation and install street lighting in the eastern part of the 
city. 
City officials say that police patrols have already been increased in the area 
and new lighting will be installed using other public funds. 
"It's a real farce," said Hermandad director Nativo Lopez. "The city talks big 
about fighting crime but does not want to do anything to curb the conditions 
that lead to crime." 
The Civic Center Barrio Housing Corp., a nonprofit group that helps low-income 
residents buy their own homes, had been seeking the $1.4 million in 
city-controlled federal funds to build a police substation at Madison Park. The 
organization also wanted the city to install street lighting in a neighborhood 
bordered by First Street and Edinger, Standard and Grand avenues. 
Hermandad members, who support the Civic Center Barrio, have been filling the 
council chambers since April to lobby on behalf of the organization. On Monday, 
however, the city granted $3.6 million in federal money to more than 30 
organizations but refused to award any money to the Civic Center Barrio. LILY
