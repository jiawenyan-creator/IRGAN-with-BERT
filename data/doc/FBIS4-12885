  [Text] Justice Minister Bahij Tabbarah has sent a message 
to Amnesty International urging it to check the reliability of 
its news sources. He rejected the organization's accusation 
that Lebanon has violated human rights and said Amnesty 
International has been the victim of deception and has received 
inaccurate information from sources that want to slander Lebanon. 
  Minister Tabbarah said all arrests in Lebanon are carried 
out 
according to the law and that suspects are defended by lawyers 
and are never ill-treated. 
  Minister Tabbarah called on Amnesty International not to 
hesitate to ask the concerned Lebanese authorities before 
disseminating any information about Lebanon to its member states.
