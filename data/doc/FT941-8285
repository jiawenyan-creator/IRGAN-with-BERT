FT  21 FEB 94 / School absence tables introduced
Government league tables for authorised absences and the length of the
school week will be published for all schools in England and Wales this
year.
The decision, to be announced today by Mr John Patten, the education
secretary, ensures that this year's total of school tables, due in November,
will be the biggest yet. Teachers' unions are likely to object strongly to
publication of the new information, which they claim will be irrelevant and
confusing for parents.
