FT  08 SEP 93 / Statutory basis sought for employees' rights
THE TUC yesterday backed a policy on trade union and employment rights
incorporating what it said were 'the best labour practices' in Europe and
the US.
But a motion from Mr Arthur Scargill, mineworkers' union president, calling
on unions to defy labour laws, was defeated by a two-to-one majority.
The TUC policy calls for a 'fair and balanced legal framework' for unions
based on International Labour Organisation conventions.
This would involve introducing statutory rights for workers to join,
organise and be active in unions; to strike; and to have legally binding
union recognition agreements with employers.
The strategy also includes a more active role for the TUC. This would
involve provision of TUC help to unions whose members are offered individual
contracts of employment so that they can continue to receive union services;
a TUC campaign against the trend of union derecognition by employers; and a
TUC effort to publicise the trade union cause among the public. 'The lack of
trade union freedoms in the UK is now a human-rights issue and should be
pursued as such,' the TUC said. 'The time has now come to shape a new deal
for the individual at work.'
Mr Roger Lyons, general secretary of the MSF technical union, moving the TUC
policy, said: 'The pendulum of attack on employment and trade union rights
has swung too far against individuals.'
Mr Scargill was applauded for his characteristically belligerent speech as
he put an NUM motion calling for 'non-co-operation' with employment laws.
'Don't comply with the laws,' he said. 'We need to stand up and be counted.
The movement must fight back and take collective action when it is
necessary.'
But the NUM motion was defeated on a card vote by 4,757,000 to 2,498,000.
Britain's biggest union - the 1.4m strong Unison public service union -
backed the miners.
