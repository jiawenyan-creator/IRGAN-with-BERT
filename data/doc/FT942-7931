FT  23 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: New York
The bond market looks as if it may be in for something it has not
experienced for a long time: a quiet week.
Last week, the market first agonised over whether the Federal Reserve would
put up interest rates, then celebrated when the central bank did just that.
By the week's end, the yield on the long bond had dropped from 7.5 per cent
to below 7.3 per cent, and the mood of the market was upbeat. There was even
talk that the 30-year yield might dip below 7 per cent within a few weeks if
recent increases in interest rates begin to take their toll on the pace of
economic activity.
In contrast, this week should allow traders' and investors' nerves to
settle. There is little in the way of important economic news due to be
released until Wednesday, when the April durable goods report is scheduled
for publication. Brokerage house Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette forecasts that
durable goods rose 1 per cent last month, which looks strong but is unlikely
to overly worry the market because the data is notoriously unreliable.
The only other release of note will be Friday's update of the first-quarter
gross domestic product estimate. GDP was originally estimated to have grown
by 2.6 per cent but a downward revision in the number is expected. DLJ
predicts revised GDP growth of 2 per cent.
