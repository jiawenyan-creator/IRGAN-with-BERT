  [Text] On Friday in Moscow, an agreement to avoid dual 
taxation was signed at the end of a two-day sitting of the 
Intergovernmental Commission on Trade-Economic and 
Scientific-Technical Cooperation between Russia and Slovakia. 
In addition, as was announced in the press, the same day the 
parties plan to conclude an agreement which would resolve the 
problem of the debt of the former USSR to Slovakia. 
  According to the Chairman of the Slovak Commission Brigita 
Shmegnerova, deputy chair of the Slovak Government, the parties 
negotiated the issue on compensation of Slovakia's debt to the 
former USSR as the Russian Federation acts as its legal 
successor. The Slovak delegation proposed to settle this problem 
by increasing deliveries of Russian goods and granting rights to 
Slovak firms to use industrial capacities of the Russian 
enterprises in the frameworks of cooperation. 
  Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov, co-chairman of the commission who 
represents the Russian Federation, declared that the parties 
have reached an agreement to attract representatives of Russian 
regions to cooperate in the sphere of oil supplies from Russia 
to Slovakia.
