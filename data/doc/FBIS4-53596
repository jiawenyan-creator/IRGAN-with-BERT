  [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- The U.S. Board of 
Auditors reportedly submitted a report May 17 to the effect that 
the United States "exported more than 1,500 items of material 
and equipment useful for manufacturing nuclear weapons" to 
different countries including Israel from fiscal 1988 to 1992. 
  This is a very serious act turning the nonproliferation 
treaty into a mere sheet of paper and an unpardonable criminal 
act arousing a high vigilance of the international community. 
  This lays big hurdles in the way of building a nuclear-free 
world and poses a grave threat to the existence of mankind. 
  The United States, the mastermind of nuclear proliferation, 
is taking issue with the peaceful use of nuclear energy by the 
DPRK and urging it to "implement the nonproliferation treaty" as 
regards its "nuclear issue." This reminds people of a thief 
crying "stop thief." 
  It is ridiculous of the United States to try to brand the 
DPRK as a nuclear criminal with a fiction of "nuclear issue of 
North Korea" invented as part of its anti-socialist, anti-DPRK 
campaign. 
  It is the United States that must stand in the dock before 
the international community as a criminal state of nuclear 
proliferation because it hinders the denuclearisation of the 
world by exporting nuclear weapon-grade material and encouraging 
the emergence of potential nuclear-weapon states. 
  The United States, instead of vilifying the peaceloving 
DPRK, 
must apologize to the international community for its criminal 
encouragement of nuclear proliferation in violation of the 
nonproliferation treaty and no longer hinder the building of a 
nuclear-free world.
