SPECIAL SCREENING: 'LEACH LORD' GIVES POTENT STATEMENT 
Los Angeles film maker Eric Saks' independent movie "Forevermore: Biography of 
a Leach Lord" -- which screens tonight at 8 at the Film-forum, with the film 
maker present -- reminds us how thin many studio-made movies are these days. 
Saks' movie, shot for $14,000, is a mock documentary that traces the 
extra-legal career of the fictional Isaac Hudak through TV science shows, drug 
smuggling and gambling to his true metier: secretively dumping poisonous 
wastes. 
It has an incredibly rich, packed and well-imagined story line -- with enough 
narrative material for a dozen conventional movies -- and enough factual data 
on waste pollution and science left over for several documentaries as well. 
The style, influenced by both Jean-Luc Godard and experimentalist Jim Benning 
(who appears in the cast), is a collage in which image, sound track and 
narration blend or clash while hard, bright shots of American landscapes, 
people and objects collide rigorously. With the frighteningly plausible Hudak 
at its center, "Forevermore" is a cutting attack on American greed from the 
'50s through the '80s and beyond. MICHAEL WILMINGTON
