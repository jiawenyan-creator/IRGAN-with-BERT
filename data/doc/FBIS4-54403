  [Text] Prague, April 28 (CTK) -- Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec said he considers the future to be more important than 
the past concerning Bulgaria's outstanding debt with the Czech 
Republic, after being asked today when the debt would be 
settled. In his opinion, the debt does not involve an 
exorbitant sum, and it would be important and productive for 
both countries to eliminate it and thus relieve uncertainty in 
mutual trade. Zieleniec noted that a substantial part of the 
debt was resolved last year. 
  Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov, who met with 
Zieleniec today in Prague, also emphasized that his country had 
done a lot to resolve debts with the former Czechoslovakia, 
Poland, and Hungary that it had inherited from the Comecon 
[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] era. "It isn't an easy 
matter, but Bulgaria is committed to upholding its international 
commitments," Daskalov said. 
  Sofia's debt burden with Czechoslovakia reached almost 1.8 
billion crowns during the days of the communist trading bloc. A 
third of the debt was resolved at the end of last year. 
  The ministers also discussed at their meeting today the 
completion of an agreement to support and protect investment, 
and spoke about launching negotiations to limit double taxation.
