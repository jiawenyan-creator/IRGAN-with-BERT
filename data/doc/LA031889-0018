UPROAR OVER TWO FLAG EXHIBITS 
In response to "3,000 Protest Chicago Exhibit of Flag on Floor," Part I, March 
13: 
The outcry over Scott Tyler's exhibit at the Art Institute of Chicago is so 
great that I had to write. He is displaying the flag on the floor with a ledger 
above the display inviting comments. People are invited or forced to walk on 
the flag in order to write their thoughts in the ledger. 
Scott maintains that he has a constitutional right of free speech, and has the 
right to display the flag in that manner. I would like to tell Scott that he is 
very much mistaken. The flag is not art. It is a symbol of our nation. It 
represents ideals, including free speech. 
When someone desecrates the symbol, then he makes a mockery of the ideals of 
that symbol. Scott is a hypocrite because he mocks the very ideal he says he 
has a right to. That ideal is free speech. 
When you value rights, you should not be so quick to desecrate the very symbol 
that gave them to you. So, Scott, swallow your pride and close your exhibit; 
you made your point, as weak as it was.
