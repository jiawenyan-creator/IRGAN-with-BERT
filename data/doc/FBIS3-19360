  [Text] Norway is now backing down over one of the more 
central demands in the negotiations on EU [European Union] 
membership. Norwegian radio reports that Fisheries Minister Jan 
Henry Olsen has agreed that Norway will abandon the exlusive 
negotiation right with Russia on fishing quotas in the Barents 
Sea. The EU has all along demanded that if Norway joins the EU, 
the EU must also have the negotiation right with Russia on how 
much cod may be caught in the Barents Sea.
