  [Text] Hong Kong, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The value of Hong 
Kong's total exports grew by 8.1 percent in the first four 
months of this year over the same period of last year, the 
Census and Statistics Department announced today. 
  Among the total, the value of re-exports rose by 13 percent, 
while that of domestic exports fell by 7.8 percent, according to 
external trade figures released by the department. 
  Supported largely by the continued expansion in Hong Kong's 
re-export trade, the value of imports showed an increase of 9.5 
percent. 
  These led to a visible trade deficit of 24.4 billion H.K. 
dollars (3.13 billion U.S. dollars in the first four months, 
equivalent to 6.8 percent of the value of imports during the 
period. 
  This compared with a deficit of 18.4 billion H.K. dollars 
(2.34 billion U.S. dollars), equivalent to 5.6 percent of the 
value of imports, recorded in the same period of last year. 
  Commenting on the trade figures, a government spokesman said 
that the performance of re-exports was still quite robust, 
although the growth rate had moderated somewhat from last year. 
  The spokesman attributed the moderation mainly to slower 
growth in re-exports to the Chinese mainland, the United States 
and Germany.
