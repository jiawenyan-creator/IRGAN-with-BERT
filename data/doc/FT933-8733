FT  13 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Exciting bull market' forecast
for cocoa as stocks fall
THE COCOA market appears to be heading for 'the most exciting bull market
for some time', according to GNI, the London trade house.
As continuing supply deficits bring further reductions in world stocks a
rerun of the massive bull market of the 1970s 'is not out of the question',
GNI says in its latest Cocoa Outlook report.
That would suggest a surge from an average price of Pounds 745 a tonne this
year to Pounds 1,600 a tonne in 1994 and Pounds 2,700 a tonne in 1995.
'Ultimately the rally should peter out close to the July 1977 second
(futures) position high of Pounds 3,512 a tonne in 1995,' the report says.
In reaching this conclusion GNI takes as its starting point a reassessment
of supply in the 1992-93 season. The Ivory Coast, the biggest cocoa
producer, has banned mid-crop exports, which account for 150,000 tonnes out
of the country's total production of 750,000 tonnes. As a result, GNI says,
while the global production deficit for the year is only about 100,000
tonnes, the supply deficit is about 244,000 tonnes.
The report admits that much of the Ivorian mid-crop will be carried over
into 1993-94, but suggests that about a third will be lost because of poor
storage conditions in the villages. Thus the 1993-94 main crop is likely to
be swollen by only about 100,000 tonnes. And as the Ivorians plan to
continue the embargo on mid-crop sales another 50,000 tonnes is likely to be
lost to the world market next season.
With Indonesia the only big producer whose output is increasing, global
supply is therefore expected to increase only marginally in 1993-94. So,
assuming continued steady growth in consumption, GNI forecasts a further
significant supply deficit of 241,000 tonnes.
Other significant factors taken into account in the report include signs
that yields in the three big African producing countries - the Ivory Coast,
Nigeria and Ghana - could be 'significantly below par next year', while
Malaysia's planted area is expected to contract as growers switch to more
profitable crops.
GNI calculates that world stocks of cocoa should fall below the
psychologically important 1m-tonne mark to 918,000 tonnes by the end of the
1993-94 season 'even without any significant problems'. That would represent
about 36 per cent of annual consumption. By the end of the 1994-95 season,
the report suggests, that figure will have fallen below 30 per cent, 'which
is normally regarded as critical'.
On the question of the disposal of the International Cocoa Organisation
buffer stock of 230,000 tonnes, GNI says it is reasonable to assume that
this will be done in an orderly fashion - probably at a rate of 46,000
tonnes in each of the five years of the ICCO's new economic agreement.
'The buffer stock could then be regarded as an independent supplier with
fixed five-year production horizon,' the report says. 'Indeed it would then
be valid to erase the 230,000 tonnes from the global stock figure, giving a
stock to consumption ratio of just 27 per cent at the end of 1993-94 - well
below the critical 30 per cent barrier.'
All this adds up to an 'unequivocally bullish' outlook for the cocoa price,
GNI says. 'It is surprising that the price has not moved higher this year.'
