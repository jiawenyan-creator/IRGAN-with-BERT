 

Under section 110(a)(2)(E)(iii) of the Act, the State must provide necessary assurances that the State has responsibility
for ensuring adequate implementation of these plan provisions. The State has the authority to take legal action against
the County if the State determines that the County is not carrying out its enforcement responsibilities. See Appendix
B, Exhibit 13 of the SIP revision, Arizona State Senate Bill 1430. 


III. Implications of Today's Action 


EPA is proposing to approve the moderate nonattainment area PM

10

 plan revision submitted to EPA for the Maricopa County Urban Planning Area on August 11, 1993 and amended on March 3,
1994. Among other things, the State of Arizona has demonstrated that the PPA cannot practicably attain the PM

10

 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. EPA is therefore proposing to reclassify the PPA as a serious nonattainment area at this
time. However, EPA currently believes that the alternative approach authorized by the Clean Air Act of evaluating
the area's attainment status after December 31, 1994 is a more appropriate approach. Therefore, in the absence of
compelling countervailing arguments from the public, EPA does not intend to take final action on the reclassification
proposal in this notice. 
As noted, additional submittals for the initial moderate 
PM

10

 nonattainment areas were due at later dates. EPA will determine the adequacy of any such submittal as appropriate.



IV. Request for Public Comments 


EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of today's proposal. As indicated at the outset of this notice, EPA will consider
any comments received by (30 days from date of publication). 


V. Executive Order 12866 


This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989, (54 FR 22142225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro,
Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory
action from Executive Order 12866 review. 


VI. Regulatory Flexibility 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. sections 603 and 604. Alternatively,
EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Small entities include small businesses, small not-for- profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction
over populations of less than 50,000. 
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, Part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover,
due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. the Clean Air Act forbids
EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.
