  [Text] Police have denied reports of a fresh flare-up of 
clashes in Molo Division during which it is alleged nine people 
were killed and hundreds displaced. In a statement to the KBC, 
the Rift Valley provincial police officer, Francis Sang, said 
investigations as on the spot check at Kamara and Mau Summit 
showed that no clashes whatsoever occurred in the area as 
imagined by the reporters from THE STANDARD newspaper in an 
article published today. [sentence as heard] He noted that 
despite having checked with the Molo police chief who refuted 
the story, the two reporters went ahead and published their 
(?illusory) story. Mr. Sang also said a check with the Nyayo 
Bus Corporation confirmed that none of their vehicles had been 
hired to transport those displaced from Molo to Kisii town as 
reported in the press. He said appropriate machinery was 
already in place to ensure the authors of the story, which was 
obviously meant to create animosity and disrupt peace in Molo, 
are brought to book.
