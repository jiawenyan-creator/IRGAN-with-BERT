FT  28 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television
Class changed A coati is an irresistibly pretty beast which few of us know a
great deal about. Wildlife on One: Noses of Nancite (BBC 1, 8.00) is filmed
in the region of Costa Rica where coatis gambol through the trees and feast
off turtle-eggs on the silver sands. Theirs is a convivial society in which
the females dominate and males are allowed back only once a year for
procreative purposes.
I continue to admire the remarkably intelligent series, The Essential
History of Europe (BBC 2, 8.00) which this week looks at Portugal, a country
which within 20 years has experienced a quite astonishing change in
standards of living.
Jokes about Swedish au pairs have seemingly and mercifully gone out of
fashion but the Radio 4 documentary series Soundtrack (7.20) follows the
story of one such appurtenance of middle-class comfort. Which leads into the
return of another admirably intelligent series which one might go so far as
to call a jewel of British broadcasting, Radio 4's Analysis. Tonight (8.00)
a new series starts with an inquiry into what it means for the British to
talk about a national heritage, a national culture, etc.
