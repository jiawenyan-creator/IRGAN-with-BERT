Research Plan fee percentage. 

The Research Plan fee percentage for a calendar year must equal the lesser of 2 percent of the exvessel value of retained
catch in the Research Plan fisheries or the fee percentage calculated using the following equation: 




Fee percentage=[100&times;(RRPC^FB^OF)/V]/(1^NPR),




where: 




RRPC is the projection of recoverable Research Plan costs for the coming year; 
FB is the projected end of the year balance of funds collected under the Research Plan; 
OF is the projection of other funding for the coming year; 
V is the projected exvessel value of retained catch in the Research Plan fisheries for the coming year; and

NPR is the percent (expressed as a decimal) of fee assessments that are expected to result in nonpayment. 




For 1995, the best estimate of RRPC is $15.4 million. FB will be $0 for 1995; because no fees will be collected in 1994,
no balance of funds at the end of 1994 will be applied against program costs in 1995. OF for 1995 is projected to be $2.6
million, consisting of $2.1 million from NMFS and $0.5 million from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. V for 1995
is estimated to be $692.7 million, as described under item 2 above. NPR is estimated at 2.5 percent. Therefore, applying
the formula above, the calculated fee percentage would be: 




[100&times;($15.4 million^$0^$2.6 million)/$692.7 million]/(1^.025) = 1.9 percent. 




Because the calculated fee is less than the maximum assessable fee, the proposed fee percentage for 1995 is 1.9 percent.

4. 

Observer coverage. 

For 1995, observer coverage levels in Research Plan fisheries are unchanged from 1994 and are set out at 677.10(a).

5. 

Embarkment/disembarkment ports. 

For 1995, observer contractors and vessels required to have observer coverage arrange for observer embarkment and
disembarkment. NMFS is not involved in this arrangement. Therefore, specification of embarkment/disembarkment
ports for 1995 is not necessary. 



Final Research Plan Specifications 



NMFS will consider comments received on these proposed specifications and, after consulting with the Council, will
publish final specifications in the 

Federal Register
