FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring and new products elevate TGI
TGI, the designer and manufacturer of loudspeaker products, reported a surge
in pre-tax profits - from Pounds 409,000 to Pounds 1.25m - in the year to
March 31.
Turnover rose 5 per cent to Pounds 35.8m (Pounds 34m). Operating profit
expanded to Pounds 1.56m (Pounds 587,000) and retained profit rose to Pounds
694,000 (Pounds 278,000), helping reduce the deficit in the profit and loss
account.
TGI said the improved performance resulted from the introduction of new
products and the benefits of restructuring. Earnings per share expanded 86
per cent to 5.2p (2.8p) while the total dividend is lifted to 2p (1.5p) via
an increased final of 1.4p.
Exports increased to Pounds 24.8m (Pounds 22m) and accounted for 69 per cent
of total sales.
Future prospects were said to be good in the light of the substantial
investment made in new products and manufacturing improvements as well as
some Pounds 1.27m spent on research and development. TGI is also considering
strategic acquisitions.
