COUNTY IN BRIEF; 
ANTELOPE VALLEY; 
BUS FARE HIKE TO 75 CENTS PROPOSED 
The basic bus fare in the Antelope Valley, which has not changed since 1982, 
would increase from 50 cents to 75 cents under a plan by Los Angeles county 
officials to improve service. 
The county also is proposing to increase the fare for students, senior citizens 
and the handicapped from 20 cents to 35 cents, county officials said. If 
approved by the Board of Supervisors, the changes could take effect later this 
year. County officials said the increases -- 50% in the basic fare and 75% in 
the discount fare -- will help fund expanded bus service to meet demands in the 
fast-growing region. In the past four years, bus ridership in the Antelope 
Valley has almost doubled.
