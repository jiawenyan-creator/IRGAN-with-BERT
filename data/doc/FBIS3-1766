  [Text] Shenyang, February 28 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's 
Liaoning Province is collecting funds to accelerate construction 
of expressways. 
  It is expected that by the end of this century the total 
length of the expressways in the province will reach 1,055 km. 
  Zhang Gongxian, deputy director of the Provincial Department 
of Communications, said that in the Eighth Five-Year Plan Period 
(1991- 1995), the province will construct the Shenyang-Benxi 
Expressway, Shenyang-Tieling Expressway and an expressway 
circling Shenyang City, the provincial capital. 
  The total length of the three expressways will be 213 km. 
  From 1996 to 2000 the province will construct the Shenyang- 
Shanhaiguan Expressway and another, from Tieling to Siping City 
in Jilin Province. The total length of the two expressways will 
be 471 km. 
  The province already has an expressway connecting Shenyang 
and Dalian, 375 km in length. 
  The investment in the three expressways under construction 
is 
about three billion yuan. 
  The state will provide 20 percent of the investment in the 
projects and Liaoning will get loans of 50 million U.S. dollars 
from the Asian Bank for the purpose. 
  The other two expressways to be constructed later this 
century will cost nine billion yuan.
