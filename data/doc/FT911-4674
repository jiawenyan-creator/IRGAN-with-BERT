FT  18 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Aegon in put option move
AEGON, the Dutch insurance company, may lower the price at which investors
can convert Swiss franc notes into shares, to discourage them from
exercising a put option which falls on June 30, writes Tracy Corrigan.
Investors must give notice of their intention to exercise that put option
between May 16 and May 31.
Holders of two convertible issues totalling SFr310m, launched by Swiss Bank
Corporation in 1986, are likely to demand early redemption under the put
option at par plus a premium of 10.25 per cent for one deal and 11.5 per
cent for the other, unless the share price improves substantially by that
time.
The share price is currently DFl 130, so conversion at the set price of DFl
126 does not appear attractive.
