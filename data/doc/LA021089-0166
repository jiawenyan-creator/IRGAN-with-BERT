FOR THE RECORD 
A table that appeared in The Times Wednesday comparing 1988-89 salary scales 
for teachers inaccurately reported what the pay range would be in the Los 
Angeles Unified School District under the school board's latest contract offer. 
The new minimum salary would be $25,316, and the maximum, paid to those with 
the equivalent of a doctorate degree, would be $46,594.
