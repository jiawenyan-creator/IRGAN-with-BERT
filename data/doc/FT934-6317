FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: France confirms oil sale agenda
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, yesterday confirmed that
Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group, would be the first company to be privatised
next year. He said the government's stake may be sold in tranches.
'It is a large amount, and it is not impossible that it could be sold in
bits,' Mr Alphandery said, adding that no decision had yet been taken on the
process of the sale.
The government's 50.8 per cent stake in Elf-Aquitaine has an estimated value
of FFr50bn (Dollars 8.5bn), much larger than the FFr28bn raised through the
privatisation of Banque Nationale de Paris, and the FFr13bn from the sale of
the state's holding in Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals group.
Industry observers say they expect the sale to be done in one block,
although payment for shares could be done in instalments.
Mr Alphandery was speaking after the government launch of a tender offer by
which companies can bid for stakes in Banque Hervet, the small private bank
to be sold as part of the privatisation programme.
The sale of 89 per cent of the shares in Banque Hervet, due to be completed
by the beginning of 1994, will not be open to a public offer. It is expected
to raise about FFr1bn.
