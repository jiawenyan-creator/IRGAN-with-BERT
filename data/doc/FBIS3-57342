  [Text] Baku, January 25 (AZERTAC)--The Azeri National Army 
has succeeded in advancing towards Kelbadzhar in south-west 
Azerbaijan. According to the Defence Ministry, the enemy's 
troops in Kelbadzhar were repulsed to the frontier between 
Azerbaijan and Armenia while troops in Agdere [Mardakert] were 
cut off from their main base in Armenia. Armenian Armed Forces 
are still occupying the town of Kelbadzhar in spite of heavy 
casualties. 
  The Defence Ministry says that the Armenian Army 
headquarters 
try to hold the Kelbadzhar base in every way. Military experts 
consider gold-fields of Kelbadzhar a reason for Armenians 
staying there. Trying to hold their positions in Kelbadzhar, the 
enemy has thrown badly trained recruits into battle over the 
last time, the ministry says. 
  Yesterday the Azeri National Army encircled and destroyed a 
group of 240 Armenian soldiers, which has tried to break through 
from Armenian to Kelbadzhar.
