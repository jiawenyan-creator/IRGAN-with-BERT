MORNING REPORT: MOVIES 
Einstein Footage Found: Nearly 4,000 feet of rare film on Albert Einstein that 
was reported missing after it fell out of a Federal Express delivery truck more 
than a week ago was returned to the University of South Carolina Wednesday. The 
films and other missing packages were returned by a Columbia, S.C., bail 
bondsman who apparently was given the parcels by a man who picked them up 
shortly after they fell off the truck. 
The films had been on their way from their home at the university to be copied 
for a French film maker. A university spokesman said Federal Express will get 
another chance to transport the films, which have historical value to 
researchers and historians, to their New Jersey destination. SHAUNA SNOW
