  [Text] Amman--AL-RA'Y has learned that the Jordanian 
Foreign Ministry has asked the Iranian Foreign Ministry to 
reduce the number of its diplomats in the Iranian Embassy in 
Amman. 
  There are more than 35 diplomats in the Iranian Embassy in 
Amman, while the Jordanian Embassy staff in Tehran numbers no 
more than three. 
  The Jordanian Foreign Ministry's request, which aims at 
creating a balance between the two countries' diplomatic 
missions, will not affect the existing fraternal relations.
