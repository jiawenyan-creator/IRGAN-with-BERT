OIL ISSUES 
Of all the industrial nations affected by this conflict, Japan, which imports 
virtually all of its oil, has the most to lose. Could it be possible that the 
United States is now fighting a war that was initiated by the greed of Kuwait 
and Japan? I believe that with Japan having the most to lose economically from 
this conflict that country should be one of the first to offer economic and 
military aid to achieve rapid resolution. To date, Japan has been conspicuously 
quiet.
