  [Text] The Haifa newspaper AL-ITTIHAD quotes a senior PLO 
source as saying that efforts are under way in several Arab 
capitals to bring Yasir 'Arafat to Jericho accompanied by 
Egyptian President Mubarak, King Hassan of Morocco, and Jordan's 
King Husayn. The source noted that this is apparently the 
reason for the delay in 'Arafat's arrival to the autonomous 
areas. Our correspondent Qaysar Kabaha reports that according 
to the PLO source, if 'Arafat arrives with these three leaders, 
the problem of his visit to Jerusalem would also be solved. The 
source added that 'Arafat is not interested in arriving in 
Jericho during the world soccer championships because these 
games will captivate worldwide attention.
