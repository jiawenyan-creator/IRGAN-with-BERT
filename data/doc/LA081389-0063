CURRENT PAPERBACKS: WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LOVE BY RAYMOND 
CARVER VINTAGE: $6.95 
Raymond Carver's short stories suggest the prose equivalent to blues songs: 
brief vignettes of tough times, unfaithful lovers, unhappy lives, the ravages 
of alcohol. Unlike Dorothy Parker, who suffered with her characters, Carver 
remains a detached observer of their pain, delineating miniature dramas in a 
few spare sentences. His characters remain trapped in circumstances beyond 
their control, and the tone of impotent inevitability only increases the 
poignancy of their plight.
