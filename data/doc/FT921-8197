FT  19 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Hong Kong to call submarine tunnel tenders
THE Hong Kong government plans to call tenders for building and operating an
estimated HKDollars 4bn (Pounds 283m) submarine tunnel linking Victoria
Island to the Kowloon Peninsula, it said yesterday, Simon Holberton reports
from Hong Kong.
The Western Harbour Crossing is one of the core projects of an
infrastructure development which, by 1997, will see the opening of a new
airport, a suspension bridge and associated roads. Many of the new
developments will be built on reclaimed land.
The tender will be let on a 'build, operate and transfer' arrangement. The
successful bidder will be awarded a franchise to operate the tunnel for 30
years and to charge tolls, after which ownership will be transferred to Hong
Kong's government.
Work on the tunnel is expected to begin by June 1993 and be ready for
traffic by the 'middle' of 1997. Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty on
July 1, 1997.
