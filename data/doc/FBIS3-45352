  [Text] The head of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office, Lu Ping, is reported to have insisted that part of the 
territory's financial reserves should be spent on the new 
airport. Mr. Lu also said the door to further talks on the 
territory's political future was still open. For the details, 
here's Joseph Tsang: 
  [Begin Tsang recording] According to a spokesman for a 
delegation of young Fukienese businessmen from Hong Kong 
visiting Beijing, Mr. Lu failed to see why the reserves could 
not injected into the airport projects, because he believed the 
economy of Hong Kong should yield more than HK$100,000 million 
[Hong Kong dollars] in reserves by 1997. He reportedly said 
Beijing had submitted several airport financing proposals to the 
British side, but there had been no response. And he was said 
to have accused the British side of failing to stick to the 
Sino-British Memorandum of Understanding on the New Airport when 
making financing proposals for the projects. 
  Mr. Lu also said Beijing had informed Britain through 
diplomatic channels that it sincerely wanted to hold further 
talks on the territory's political future, but China was 
dissatisfied with the tabling of a partial electoral bill in 
Legco [Legislative Council] on the governor's political proposal 
during such negotiations. He says such a move was not worthy of 
a gentleman, and was that of a vile character. [end recording]
