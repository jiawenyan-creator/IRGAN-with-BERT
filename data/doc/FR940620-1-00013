the management of certain widely-generated hazardous wastes under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
Subtitle C hazardous waste management regulations. The data made available for comment by this notice are included
in a document entitled ``Analysis of Potential Cost Savings and the Potential for Reduced Environmental Benefits
of the Proposed Universal Wastes Rule,'' U.S. EPA, April 1994. This document is available as discussed in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. February 11, 1993 Proposal 


On February 11, 1993, EPA proposed a streamlined, reduced regulatory management structure for certain widespread
hazardous wastes currently subject to full RCRA Subtitle C regulation, in an effort to facilitate their collection
and proper management (58 FR 8102). The proposed reduced regulatory structure, known as a special collection system,
is designed to ensure that management of these hazardous wastes is conducted in a manner that is protective of human
health and the environment, given the diffuse and diverse population of generators of these wastes. Proposed regulatory
language was included for hazardous waste batteries, and suspended and/or cancelled hazardous waste pesticides
that are recalled. Several other wastes, including hazardous waste thermostats, were also discussed briefly in
the preamble as possible additions to the special collection system. The Agency also included a proposed petition
process to be used to add additional wastes to the special collection system in the future, and criteria to identify
wastes that would be appropriate for addition. See 58 FR 8102, February 11, 1993 for a detailed discussion of the proposal.



II. Description of Available Data 


In the February 11, 1993 ``universal wastes'' proposal (58 FR 8126) the Agency committed to: 
&bull;``Analyze the costs of the current regulatory requirements for generators and collection facilities and
of the requirements [proposed]''; 
&bull;``Analyze whether there are significant reduced environmental benefits from the modifications being proposed'';
and 
&bull;Notice the analysis for comment prior to promulgating a final rule. 
The document made available for comment by this notice, ``Analysis of Potential Cost Savings and the Potential for
Reduced Environmental Benefits of the Proposed Universal Wastes Rule,'' U.S. EPA, April 1994, presents these analyses.
Part I of the document summarizes the proposed universal wastes regulations and introduces the analyses. Part II
discusses and compares estimated costs of the existing Subtitle C regulations and of the proposed changes to these
regulations. The conclusion of this analysis is that the proposed regulations will result in total annual savings
of approximately 93 million dollars. A sensitivity analysis is also included. 
Part III of the document discusses whether the proposed regulatory changes will significantly reduce the environmental
benefits provided by the current Subtitle C regulations. The conclusion of this analysis is that the proposed reduced
regulations will not significantly diminish the environmental protection currently provided by the full Subtitle
C regulations. 
The Agency is requesting comment on the methodology used and the results of both the cost analysis and the analysis
of potential significantly reduced environmental benefits.
