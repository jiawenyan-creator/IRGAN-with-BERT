FT  23 FEB 94 / Imro to publicise action against member firms
Imro, the self-regulating body for the fund management industry, has decided
to end its policy of keeping disciplinary actions against its members
secret.
Mr Philip Thorpe, chief executive, said that Imro had made the decision late
last year as part of a review of its disciplinary procedures.
Previously it recorded disciplinary actions in a 'members' register' and
sought no publicity. Investors would not learn of any disciplinary action
unless they consulted the register.
Imro yesterday announced disciplinary proceedings against four of its
members, two of which relate to breaches of the rules nearly four years ago.
One of these was against the related firms Wright Seligman and Co and Wright
Seligman Fund Managers, which are both in liquidation. Between February 8
1991 and May 22 1991 Wright Seligman and Co asked the independent custodian
to release to it customer share certificates without customer permission.
Between August 3 1990 and May 22 1991 it failed to prevent transactions by
its officers or employees which involved conflicts of interest.
Imro succeeded in having all assets returned to clients by July 1992 but
could not complete disciplinary proceedings against the firm until all
appeals were exhausted in January this year. Wright Seligman has been
ordered to pay costs of Pounds 21,000 which would have been greater had the
firm's financial position been stronger.
Imro also terminated the membership of a fund management subsidiary of
British and Commonwealth Group, which had traded under the name of RJ Shrubb
and Co. Imro found that investors' money had, without authorisation, been
deposited with British and Commonwealth Merchant Bank and that about Pounds
250,000 of interest from those deposits had been retained by the fund
management company.
