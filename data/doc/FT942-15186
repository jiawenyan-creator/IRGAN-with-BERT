FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 33m buy-out at BICC offshoot
BICC, the cables and construction group, has sold Vero Electronics, its
Southampton-based electronic packaging, power supplies and printed circuit
board manufacturer, to a management-led buy-out group for Pounds 33m.
Sir Robin Biggam, chairman, said the disposal 'marks a further stage in our
strategy to concentrate on our core businesses of cablemaking and
construction'.
Vero, which was acquired by BICC in 1979 but has subsequently been expanded,
reported operating profits of Pounds 3m last year on sales of Pounds 66m. It
employs 1,200 people.
About 70 per cent of turnover comes from the manufacture of electronic
packaging boxes, enclosures and racks which are mainly used in the
telecommunications, data communications and networking industries.
In addition, Vero supplies the niche markets for plug-in power supplies and
specialist printed circuit boards.
The management buy-out team is led by Mr Brian Gay, managing director, who
re-joined Vero in January having previously worked for the company for some
22 years until 1987.
He is leading a core buy-out team of six, together with some 40 other
managers who will be subscribing for shares in the company.
Some Pounds 15m of equity for the buy-out is being provided by Mercury
Development Capital and Candover Investments, split equally, while the Royal
Bank of Scotland is providing bank facilities totalling Pounds 16m.
