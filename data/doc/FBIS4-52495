  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Norwegian Prime Minister Gro 
Harlem Brundtland said Monday [9 May] that Japan should play a 
greater role in the U.N. Security Council, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. Brundtland made the remarks in a meeting with 
Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, the officials said. 
  Kakizawa told Brundtland that Japan is ready to become a 
permanent member of the council if recommended and that it 
intends to contribute as much as possible to U.N. activities, 
they said. 
  Brundtland and Kakizawa agreed that reform of the council 
will not be completed just by giving Japan and Germany permanent 
seats. They also agreed on the need to take into account the 
balance between regional and developing nations. 
  The Norwegian prime minister called on Japanese cabinet 
ministers to visit Norway, they said. 
  The 30-minute meeting was conducted in English, without 
interpreters, the officials said. 
  Brundtland is in Japan for a three-day stay until Wednesday 
to attend a council meeting of the Socialist International. She 
will meet Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday evening.
