FT  26 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Markets
Sentiment has buffeted the London stock market all week. In the first half,
the plunge on Wall Street caused the damage - though it is hard to argue
that British equities are overvalued. The ratio between bond and equity
yields is actually below its average since 1970. Since Thursday, the market
has been dogged by political worries. Again, sentiment rather than logic has
been decisive. Not only is it highly unlikely that Mr John Major will be
defeated in a leadership challenge; even if he were, it is not obvious why
the market should care.
Next week sentiment could move in the other direction. True, political
rumblings will continue, until it is clear that Mr Major is home and dry on
Wednesday. But provided Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, can make himself
heard above the din, he should have good news for the markets when he
presents the Budget on Tuesday. He should be able to cut his forecast for
next year's public-sector borrowing requirement to Pounds 24bn or less. That
should be positive for gilts, with equities benefiting in their wake.
Investors are already giving the government some credit for its responsible
monetary policy; a convincing statement of fiscal policy would reinforce its
standing among international investors, particularly given the parlous state
of many other governments' finances.
The real worry is not next week's but next year's Budget. Mr Major will be
tempted to agree a high-spending, tax-cutting Budget to sweeten voters just
before the next general election. But it is not clear that it would be in Mr
Clarke's interest to compromise his reputation for fiscal responsibility.
The more he can reassure investors on Tuesday about 1995 the better.
