FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Aer Lingus sees 'turning point'
Aer Lingus, the Irish state airline, plans to recapture lost market share on
its transatlantic services with the announcement yesterday of plans to
replace its two ageing Boeing 747s, now in service for 25 years, with three
leased Airbus A330s.
New transatlantic fare structures are also to be introduced, alongside a new
daily direct service to the US from both Dublin and Shannon.
Mr Bernie Cahill, the chairman who has overseen a complex restructuring plan
which was finalised last month, said: 'The acquisition of this new
transatlantic fleet and the unveiling of the new plans for the Aer Lingus
operation marks the turning point in what has been a difficult and testing
time for the airline'.
The restructuring plan involved cutting IPounds 50m (Pounds 48m) in annual
operating costs through 800 voluntary redundancies and changes in work
practices, in return for which the government is to provide a total of
IPounds 175m in new equity over the next two years.
Aer Lingus said it will increase its promotional spend in the US market by
75 per cent this year, and is to offer fare reductions of between 10 and 20
per cent into Ireland from the US.
The company 'is aiming for a general growth in leisure traffic as a result
of the competitive fares which will arise from a lower cost base . . . a key
objective of the new Aer Lingus schedule is to reverse the trend of US
traffic to Ireland via London, Manchester and other UK points'.
In 1992-93 the airline's transatlantic services incurred an operating loss
of IPounds 13m. A total of 4.3m passengers were carried with a load factor
of 71 per cent.
