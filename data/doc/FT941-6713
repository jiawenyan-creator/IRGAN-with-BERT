FT  01 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Brittan tells China not to hit UK
companies
Sir Leon Brittan, European Commissioner for external relations and trade,
warned China yesterday not to punish British companies in retaliation for a
row over Hong Kong, saying such action against any member of the European
Union was unacceptable, Reuter reports from Beijing. Sir Leon is shown above
speaking at a press conference in Beijing with Ms Wu Yi, China's minister of
foreign trade, yesterday.
Sir Leon, holding talks on subjects including Beijing's bid to re-enter
Gatt, said non-discrimination was the basis of EU trade policy.
He later told BBC radio he had had an assurance 'from the very highest level
in China' that there would be no discrimination against any EU member state
and that it was recognised that non-discrimination was a fundamental
principle of Gatt.
