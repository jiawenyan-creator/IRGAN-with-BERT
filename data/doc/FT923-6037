FT  27 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Neighbours build up links with Pretoria -
Philip Gawith on a struggling region which has found a new level of
co-operation
ECONOMIC need has concentrated political minds in southern Africa where
seven countries are co-operating in the handling of 8.2m tonnes of maize
imported into the region, which has been devastated by one of the worst
droughts this century.
At the heart of the scheme is Spoornet, the state-run South African rail
company, enjoying a level of regional co-operation which would have been
unthinkable during the apartheid years.
Although co-operation over the shipments was prompted by fears in some areas
of possible starvation, it is also a sign of it being more acceptable for
South Africa's neighbours - Lesotho, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia
and Malawi - to be seen doing business with it now that a transition to
democracy is under way. This raises the question of what steps South Africa
should take to integrate itself formally into the region and what sort of
economic assistance the international community can offer.
At the heart of these issues lies one broad plank of consensus: the southern
African region will prosper or perish as a unit. Although differences in
wealth and resources between countries mean that there will not be an even
rate of progress or failure, it is inconceivable that South Africa will
flourish in splendid isolation or that its neighbours will progress without
it.
South Africa is well aware, in the phrase of Dr Anton Rupert, the famous
tobacco entrepreneur: 'If your neighbour doesn't eat, you don't sleep
peacefully.' Already there are 27,000 Mozambican refugees living in the
eastern Transvaal, victims of drought and civil war. Refugees are also
filtering into the northern Transvaal from Zimbabwe.
Not only does this sort of inflow strain limited resources, but the economic
fragility of South Africa's neighbours also limits what ought to be
important markets. According to a study by the London-based Overseas
Development Institute (ODI)*, Africa accounts for only 7 per cent of South
Africa's exports, with a quarter of this going to Zimbabwe.
Aside from trade and humanitarian concerns, regional politicians are also
aware that, in an era of capital scarcity, they have a lot of work to do if
they are to garner even a fraction of international capital flows, very
little of which currently come to Africa.
The main obstacles to foreign investment in the region are problems of
political instability, economic decay and a dilapidated infrastructure.
However, the recent talks between Mozambican President Joachim Chissano and
rebel Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama, the upcoming elections in Angola, and
South Africa's transition process all represent important progress, albeit
of a very fragile kind.
Peace, however, is only the first step. The extent to which governments will
subsequently be able to forge a framework of economic co-operation remains
to be seen.
The potential for regional integration is also complicated by South Africa's
dominant position whereby its gross national product (GNP) exceeds the
combined GNP of the 20 member countries of the two regional trade groupings
 -the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) and the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), the new version of SADCC - by about 40 per cent.
Conventional wisdom suggests that greater economic convergence is necessary
for successful integration.
In their more sanguine moments, South Africa's neighbours look on it as a
market for their goods, and a source of funds for projects which other
international investors or governments won't fund. Underlying that, however,
is an anxiety that the normalisation of South Africa's political situation
may be to their disadvantage.
Thus the ODI special report, which investigates the possibility of granting
financial and trade privileges to South Africa, found that the most common
reaction outside South Africa when the possibility of EC preferences was
raised was 'incredulity'. The report finds, however, that the gains from
preferential trade regimes with the EC would be small because the bulk of
South Africa's exports are metals and minerals which face low barriers.
The authors conclude, therefore, that since South Africa's principal
economic problems are domestic, not external, foreign assistance would
probably best be directed elsewhere. This thinking is likely to be consonant
with the priorities of any future government, which will face overwhelming
pressure to improve domestic social conditions.
Trade concessions will be welcome, and regional integration may provide a
warm feeling of returning to the fold, but these issues will not top any
list of economic priorities.
