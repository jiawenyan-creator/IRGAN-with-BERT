FACES . . .: SIBLING RIVALRY PAYS OFF 
Kevin Dillon says he doesn't really mind being thought of as Matt Dillon's 
younger brother. 
"I expected it from the start," says the 23-year-old actor with an air of 
laid-back good grace. "I'm proud to be Matt's brother. I think he's a great 
actor." 
Besides, "Wanting to get out from under that makes me fight to work even 
harder." 
Dillon's fight to work ("I'm still an auditioner") has put him squarely in 
front of the public in recent weeks, with the back-to-back film releases "War 
Party" and "Immediate Family" -- in addition to his role as a sympathetic 
friend in "When He's Not a Stranger," a date-rape TV movie airing Monday night 
at 9 on CBS. 
He is especially proud of "Immediate Family," in which he plays the teen father 
of Mary Stuart Masterson's baby, scrutinizing potential adoptive parents Glenn 
Close and James Woods. 
"I have friends who've been in situations like that -- getting a girl pregnant 
-- so I used some of what these guys went through. It's a very tough thing," 
says Dillon, who won critical praise for his performance. 
Making the movie also taught the single actor that "I myself am not ready for 
fatherhood. Some day, but not now. 
"It's just the way they cry all the time," he complains with a laugh. "He 
ruined some of my best takes, that baby!" STACY JENEL SMITH
