THE SIDELINES; 
CHARGERS TO GET BEARS' SANDERS 
Unprotected free agent Thomas Sanders, a running back with the Chicago Bears 
for five years, has decided to sign with the San Diego Chargers, his agent 
said. 
The team is negotiating a two- or three-year contract, and no major obstacles 
are expected, said agent Harold Odom. Details of the agreement are expected to 
be worked out this week. 
Sanders, 28, had visited Philadelphia, Washington, Miami, Minnesota, Dallas, 
Kansas City and the Los Angeles Rams before settling on San Diego. Sanders said 
the team's new general manager, Bobby Beathard, was key in turning him toward 
the Chargers.
