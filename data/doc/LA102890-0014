CHALLENGES TO PORTRAYALS AND CASTING 
In his film "Avalon," director Barry Levinson casts four non-Jews in the major 
roles. 
And although there is a subliminal Jewish star at a cemetery, the word Jew is 
not used once in the movie. 
Where were the Jewish actors? Martin Scorsese unabashedly casts Italians as 
Italians in "GoodFellas." He loves his paisani so well he casts them in all the 
roles. He's not worried what others might think. 
I don't know why Levinson chose this path. It awakens in me all those ancient 
fears that if the Gentiles know who the Jews really are they will drive us out 
of this country.
