FT  04 JAN 94 / Mideast peace process passes 'point of no return'
The main players in the Mideast peace process have passed the point of no
return, British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd said last night as he arrived
in Israel on the second leg of a regional tour, Reuter reports from Tel
Aviv.
In Tunis yesterday Palestine Liberation Organisation leaders rejected
conditions set by Israel for resuming talks on implementing their self-rule
accord. Mr Hurd, who today will meet prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and
foreign minister Shimon Peres, said: 'Going forward, though difficult, is
easier than going back.'
Meanwhile, Israeli opposition chief Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to reverse
an earlier pledge when he said in Jerusalem that his Likud party would not
be bound by the Israeli-PLO peace deal if it came to power.
