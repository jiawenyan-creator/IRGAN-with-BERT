FT  12 FEB 93 / US involvement in Bosnia welcomed
Leaders of Bosnia's three ethnic groups yesterday welcomed direct US
involvement in the peace process, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. The move
was greeted too by Britain and France, both with troops in Bosnia delivering
humanitarian aid, and the European Community, which has been trying to
broker peace agreements. 'It gives hope, not a great hope, but hope that a
solution can be found,' Commission President Jacques Delors said. Germany
said the US six-point plan would boost prospects for an end to the
bloodshed.
Nato Secretary-General Manfred Worner also welcomed the US commitment to
'engage actively and directly in the efforts to reach a just .. resolution
to the conflict.'
