FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Strong second half boosts GUS - Cautious
outlook despite improved all-round performance
GREAT UNIVERSAL Stores, the mail order, financial services and property
company, yesterday beat market expectations with a 4.7 per cent profit
increase after a strong second half.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 438.6m to Pounds 459.2m in the year to
March 31 on turnover ahead 2.9 per cent at Pounds 2.6bn.
After stripping out gains from property trading of Pounds 12.1m (Pounds
12.2m) and exceptional items of Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 7.3m), operating profits
increased by 5.3 per cent to Pounds 441.5m.
Mr Richard Pugh, deputy chairman, said all divisions performed well though
the company remained cautious about the economic outlook. 'Things are a
little better,' he said.
Second half profits of Pounds 272.6m compared to the interim figure of
Pounds 186.6m, when turnover was almost unchanged at Pounds 1.17bn.
Home shopping, which includes the Great Universal and Kays mail order
businesses in the UK, increased trading profits by 5.7 per cent to Pounds
195.5m, helped by cost cutting.
Burberrys recovered from a weak first half to lift profits 11 per cent to
Pounds 32.3m, helped by licensing income in Japan and the US.
Overseas retailing improved by 41 per cent due to a strong performance in
South Africa and a small profit, compared to a loss, in Canada.
The financial division saw profits fall slightly from Pounds 140.8m to
Pounds 139.3m. This included investment income, which the company did not
reveal, on its cash and bank balances which increased from Pounds 474m to
'about Pounds 590m', Mr Pugh said.
Property rentals on the company's 1,200 sites increased by 5.2 per cent to
Pounds 62.2m. Property investments were revalued at only 2 per cent below
last year's figure.
Earnings increased by 3.38p to 125.1p.
An improved final dividend of 27.25p is proposed, to make a total of 40p
(37.5p).
COMMENT
Yesterday's 43p rise to Pounds 14.48 in the A shares is fair reward for good
results. But it also reflects the market's renewed, and presumably fickle,
enthusiasm for defensive stocks. GUS supporters pointed to
lower-than-expected property revaluations and the trading statement that the
first two months are ahead of last time. But the 2 per cent mark down
follows a 15 per cent devaluation last year, and one wily analyst pointed
out that GUS usually comments on the first three months of trading. Perhaps
June was not so good. Profit forecasts of Pounds 460m 'clean' put the shares
just shy of 12 times, suggesting further headway from here may be hard work.
