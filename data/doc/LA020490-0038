IT'S ST. BERNARD OVER ST. ANTHONY AT BUZZER, 59-58 
After lealding by as many as 10 points in the first half, St. Bernard High held 
on in a tight second half to beat visiting St. Anthony High, 59-58, in a Camino 
Real League game Saturday night as a 16-foot jump shot by the Saints' Damaine 
Powell bounced off the back rim at the buzzer. 
The Vikings (12-10, 7-5), who had four players score in double figures, were 
paced by Wyking Jones' 15 points. 
Terry Sullivan (12 points) hit two free throws with 35 seconds left to close 
the scoring. 
"He's been a clutch player for us," St. Bernard Coach Jim McClune said of 
Sullivan. "So I wasn't surprised. I thought he would (hit the free throw)." 
The second-place Saints (13-5, 9-3) were led by Oscar Encinas, who scored 23 
points. 
With 1:42 left in the game, Powell found backcourt mate Mike Smith open for a 
layup that gave St. Anthony a 56-53 lead. 
Ten seconds later Chris Keldorf (12 points) was fouled making a three-point 
basket and converted to give St. Bernard a 57-56 lead. 
Encinas missed on the Saints' next possession, but Smith scored after making a 
steal to give them a one-point lead with 39 seconds left. 
A backcourt foul by Powell four seconds later sent Sullivan to the line, where 
he provided the margin of victory.
