<F P=106> [Stanislav Kucher report: "Duma on Peace and Peacekeepers"] </F>
  [Text] The Russian Duma has adopted at first reading the 
draft of a new law on peacekeeping forces. In full the 
document's title runs: "On the Procedure for Offering Russian 
Federation Military and Civilian Personnel for Participation in 
Operations Aimed at Maintaining or Restoring International Peace 
and Security and Other Forms of Peacekeeping Activity." 
  This means that it is planned to incorporate a military 
contingent, that to say, "Russian peacekeepers," within the 
Russian Armed Forces. Effectively, we already have such forces 
(the 201st Divisiion in Tajikistan, battalions in the Dniester 
Region and Moldova). 
  The main bone of contention in the discussion of the draft 
law was the question of jurisdiction over the peacekeepers. The 
parliamentary defense committee thought that the contigent 
should be set up under the Ministry of Defense. Another 
proposal came from the Ministry for Civil Defense Affairs and 
Emergency Situations, which came to the Duma with a proposal 
that the peacekeeping forces be placed under its own 
jurisdiction "so as not to distract the Army from fulfilling 
functions not appropriate to it."
