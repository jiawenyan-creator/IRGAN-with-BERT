FT  29 DEC 93 / International Company News: Foster's grants share option to
Molson
Foster's Brewing Group, the Australian brewer, is granting an option to
Canada's Molson Company, which will allow the latter to acquire a further 10
per cent interest in the Molson Brewing Partnership.
The partnership is the brewing alliance between Foster's, Molson and Miller
Brewing, part of the New York-based Philip Morris group.
At present, Miller owns 20 per cent of Molson Breweries, while Foster's and
the Molson Company have 40 per cent each. Foster's said that the option was
sought 'to enable it to increase its interest in the Molson Brewing
Partnership to 50 per cent in certain circumstances'.
Foster's added: 'The granting of the option does not signal any intention of
Foster's to sell any of its interest, and if exercised, does not effect
partner voting rights.'
If the option was exercised, the price for the purchase of the 10 per cent
interest would be based on a multiple of earnings before interest and tax.
Foster's said that the multiple was substantially greater than that paid by
Miller when it bought its interest in the Molson Brewing Partnership earlier
in the year.
