  [Text] Paris, June 23 (AFP) -- French troops taking part in 
a mercy mission to Rwanda crossed into the strife-torn country 
from Zaire on Thursday [23 June], government sources said. 
  Reconnaissance units from the mission codenamed Operation 
Turquoise crossed the border from Goma in Zaire to Rwanda's 
Gisenyi region at around 1330 GMT, the sources said. 
  A second group crossed the border some 100 kilometres (62 
miles) further south at Bukavu in Zaire and were heading towards 
Cyangugu in Rwanda, the sources added. 
  The second group totalled some 100 to 200 men in armoured 
vehicles and backed by helicopters, military sources said. 
  Acting under a UN mandate, they have been ordered to come to 
the assistance of some 8,000 members of the minority Tutsi 
people who are stranded inside territory held by forces of the 
majority Hutu government.
