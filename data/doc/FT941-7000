FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Are company cars a waste of money? -
With a new tax system for business drivers imminent, Scheherazade Daneshkhu
examines the impact
Should you keep your company car? The question arises because a new system
of taxing the UK's 1.8m company car drivers will come into force from next
month.
The old scale charges, based on three engine-size bands and two price
'thresholds,' will disappear. Under the simpler replacement system, tax will
be paid on a fixed percentage of the manufacturer's list price when new,
plus any extras and value added tax.
The new system - detailed by Norman Lamont, the former chancellor of the
exchequer, in his March 1993 Budget - is aimed at ending distortions in the
new car market. The government has said that, on average, the amount raised
will be the same as under the old system, although some people will pay more
and others less.
Most pay-as-you-earn employees will not be able to tell from their tax code
if they are better or worse off because most are based on the old system.
The Inland Revenue says this is because list prices have not been submitted
by employers. Codes taking the new tax system into account will have the
word 'new' alongside the car benefit figure.
If the old system works to your advantage, it is unlikely you will be in a
hurry to have your code changed; otherwise, you or your employer should
contact the Revenue with the list price of the company car to have the code
revised as soon as possible.
How will the new
system work?
The amount on which you will pay tax at your marginal rate is 35 per cent of
the list price of the car the day before it was registered; this price must
include VAT, delivery charges, and any accessories of Pounds 100 and over.
The price is capped at Pounds 80,000, so that cars with a list price above
this amount will be taxed as though the price had been Pounds 80,000.
Drivers covering 2,500-17,999 business miles will have a reduction of a
third on their assessment, while those covering more than 18,000 will
receive a discount of two-thirds.
If your company car is four or more years old at the end of the tax year,
there will be a further one-third reduction on the figure after deductions
for business mileage.
The rules differ for classic cars or those without a list price. If a car is
15 years old or more at the end of the tax year, or has a market value of
Pounds 15,000 or more (which is higher than the manufacturer's list price
when the car was first registered), the price for tax purposes will be the
open market value of the car and its accessories.
Fuel provided for private use will be taxed on the basis of the car's engine
size and whether it is petrol or diesel-powered. But there is no tax if you
pay for private motoring fuel yourself.
You can also reduce your tax bill if you contribute towards the cost of the
car or its accessories to a maximum of Pounds 5,000 (including VAT).
Kevin Paterson, of accountant Ernst &amp; Young, says the new system throws up
some unfair anomolies. If it had been operating last year, two drivers doing
the same business mileage in a Ford Mondeo 1.8LX, one taking delivery in
March and the other in June, would have faced a Pounds 400 difference in
their car benefit charge.
This is because Ford changed the list price of the car at least twice in the
year.
Who will benefit?
Table 1 shows how to calculate if you will gain under the new rules. First,
identify into which of the five brackets your car falls under the old
system, based on its cost when new and its cylinder capacity.
Then, compare your car's list price to the break-even list price shown in
the first column. If the list price is greater than the break-even figure,
you are a loser; if it is less, you are a winner.
For example, all drivers of two-litre cars costing less than Pounds 19,250
will be hit if the list price of their car is greater than Pounds 12,814.
A survey released this week by WF Corroon, an actuarial and benefits
consultancy, found that middle managers driving mostly Fords, Vauxhalls and
Rovers costing between Pounds 16,000 and Pounds 23,600 would lose the most
under the new system, with some paying as much as Pounds 600 extra tax.
Corroon's Ian Morgan said: 'Chairmen, chief executives and managing
directors who drive mainly Jaguars, BMWs and Mercedes, costing between
Pounds 28,000 and Pounds 39,000, are affected less, with about one in three
having to pay a higher tax bill and the remainder paying less.'
Table 2 shows the change to your tax bill if you drive one of the 20 cars
listed. Drivers of very expensive cars face the heftiest increase, while
those with the cheapest listed will see a fall.
There are some oddities caused by the way the old scale charges were
calculated. The driver of a Ford Granada 2.0i Ghia with a list price of
Pounds 19,150 will have to pay an extra Pounds 591 (on the assumptions
stated in the table).
But the driver of a Saab 9000 CSE 2.0i with a list price of Pounds 20,245
will see a fall of Pounds 594. This is because of the difference in the old
scale charge for the two cars.
'In general, the losers are those drivers who chose cars at the top of the
old bands,' says Paterson.
How to decide between
keeping the car or taking cash
Many company car drivers will have made this choice already, especially
after scale charges were raised by 8 per cent for the 1993-94 tax year.
Calculating whether you would be worse or better off is difficult because it
is hard to put a price on the convenience factor of driving a company car.
If it breaks down or is involved in an accident, you do not have the bother
of arranging a replacement or negotiating with the insurance company. And,
if the insurance premium goes up because of an accident, you do not have to
pay the increase.
'Perks' drivers who do not clock 2,500 business miles will pay
proportionately the largest amount of tax, since they will not benefit from
the discounts. If you are such a driver but must have a car, it might still
be more cost-effective to have a cheaper company one.
Maurice Fitzpatrick, of accountant Chantrey Vellacott, says that if you
forego the company car to take a salary increase instead (based on the
amount the employer saves by not providing you with a car), and then buy the
same car, you will be neither better nor worse off as a result.
But, he adds, you are likely to see a benefit by taking 'an increased salary
and then running a smaller car or one which does not fit the employer's
policy.'
Nilesh Shah, tax partner at accountant Blick Rothenberg, says most employees
driving a car with a retail price of Pounds 18,500, and doing more than
18,000 business miles, will do better to keep it since the taxable benefit
is reduced by two-thirds.
Shah adds that if you do decide to hand in the company car (or to buy it off
your employer at a favourable second-hand rate) and claim business mileage
on your own vehicle instead, be sure to negotiate the rate beforehand to
make sure depreciation is taken into account.
Another option is to switch to a company car with a cheaper list price or to
retain the company car if it is four years old. 'If the list price was
Pounds 10,000 in 1989, one-third of the value would be deducted because the
car is four years old,' says Fitzpatrick. 'The 35 per cent car benefit
charge would, therefore, be levied on Pounds 6,666.
'The same car new would probably cost about Pounds 13,000, taking inflation
into account, and the 35 per cent tax will be based on that amount. You have
almost doubled your tax bill as a result of having a new company car.'
Other ways of reducing the tax bill are to keep an eye on the number of
accessories in the car, especially if you do not have it for the whole of
the tax year. 'While the car benefit charge is reduced proportionately if
the car is unavailable for part of the year, the same principle does not
apply to accessories,' says Paterson. 'Accessories fitted part-way through
the year increase the car price for the complete tax year and subsequent
years.'
A number of organisations will calculate if retaining a company car is worth
your while. London-based accountant Kingston Smith charges Pounds 25 while
Wheawill &amp; Sudworth, another London accountant, will run the calculations
through a computer without charge.
