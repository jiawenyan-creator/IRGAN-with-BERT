  [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- Outgoing Prime Minister 
Yi Hoe-chang expressed hope Saturday that the government's 
reform policy will succeed. 
  "Otherwise, it will be a big national misfortune. I pray for 
the success of the reform policy," he said. 
  Yi handed in his resignation Friday to President Kim 
Yong-sam 
after expressing discontent over the administration's 
decision-making process on national security and unification 
matters. 
  He told journalists that he had resigned of his own free 
will, denying rumors that the president told him to step down. 
  "A resignation can be expressed verbally, but I wanted to 
make my intentions clear so I followed the formal procedure." 
  Yi said he had once talked about quitting when the dismissal 
of the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries minister was 
discussed in connection with the Uruguay Round negotiations, 
because he felt responsibile for not having asked the minister 
to brief him on the UR [Uruguay Round] negotiations. 
  "But the president stopped me from resigning," the former 
judge and chairman of the Board of Audit and Inspection said. 
  "I feel regret that I could not carry out goverment policies 
in a composed and full-fledged manner while spending too much 
time and effort on coping with various sudden issues including 
water pollution." 
  Yi added that he has no intention of serving in any other 
public posts.
