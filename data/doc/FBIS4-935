  [Text] The National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] has denied 
reports that it is confined to barracks in Thokoza on the East 
Rand, but defense force troops are still in the township. An 
NPKF spokesman said the defense force had not assumed the role 
of the peacekeeping troops. The area is reported to be quiet 
today after yesterday's fierce gun battles between hostel 
dwellers and self- defense units. Five people were killed and 
about 40 wounded. 
  Earlier the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] repeated its demand 
that the peacekeeping force should be replaced by the Internal 
Stability Unit as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the police are 
investigating reports that NPKF troops fired on police officers 
in Thokoza.
