FT  10 FEB 94 / Tax efficiency 'could save Pounds 12bn'
People in the UK are Pounds 12bn worse off than they need be if they were
tax-efficient, claimed their rights and made their savings work harder,
according to research carried out for IFA Promotions, which represents
independent financial advisers.
Mintel, the financial analysts, says more than Pounds 5bn was lost through
poor use of tax allowances, a lack of planning ahead in areas such as
inheritance tax, and a failure to use tax-efficient products.
