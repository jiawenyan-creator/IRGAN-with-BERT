FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Turkish bank taken over for
Dollars 213m
IN TURKEY'S biggest bank takeover, Turk Dis Ticaret Bankasi (Disbank), the
trade finance bank set up by Isbank, Turkey's largest commercial bank, has
been bought by a private group for Dollars 213.6m.
Lapis Holding, an Istanbul-based partnership involved in gold trading and
tourism, bought Isbank's 89 per cent stake in Disbank. Payment will be made
in instalments over three years, with Dollars 75m paid immediately.
Originally a collaboration between Isbank and Bank of America, Disbank has
23 branches and made profits of Dollars 24m for 1992 on assets of Dollars
514m.
The disposal is the latest move by Isbank to reduce its share participations
in order to bring its own balance sheet in line with capital requirements
set by the Bank for International Settlements.
Lapis started in gold manufacturing and trading, but has diversified into
tourism, carpets and leather businesses. The group is the majority owner of
TYT, the small Turkish Tourism and Trade Bank, and has a 30 per cent stake
in Kanal 6, the television venture of Mr Ahmet Ozal, son of the former
Turkish president Mr Turgut Ozal.
