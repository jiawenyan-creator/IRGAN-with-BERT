FT  03 OCT 94 / People (News in the names): Ford's Devine gear-change
John Devine must be something of a stranger at Ford's headquarters in
Deerborn, Michigan, writes Richard Waters.
In the last 17 of the 27 years he has been with the US motor company, Devine
has spent only six months in Deerborn.
Last week, though, he was propelled into Ford's top management team as chief
financial officer.
His rise comes from an unlikely direction. For the past six years he has
been head of First Nationwide Bank, an underperforming savings and loan
subsidiary, which Ford is in the process of selling.
First Nationwide is the US's fifth-biggest S&amp;L, having grown rapidly under
Devine. However, it hasn't turned a profit for three years - unlike the auto
maker's other, highly profitably financing and credit card units.
'Financial services have been a good business for some time - but the
regulated banking business wasn't a good one for Ford,' says Devine.
He is not specific about what went wrong, saying only that a
highly-regulated industry like banking did not fit Ford well.
Prior to the First Nationwide interlude, Devine's resume bore all the
hallmarks of someone who was being prepared for higher things. He had spent
time in Europe, where he rose to become controller of product development in
1981, and Asia, where he became president of Ford's Japanese business in
1986.
Given Ford's declared intention of integrating its different regional
operations, that experience should certainly help.
Meanwhile, says Devine, there is one underlying objective: 'We want to keep
the profit momentum up - we don't want any let-up.'
