FT  17 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow peaks as telecoms deal
lifts sentiment
Wall Street
US SHARE prices closed just short of record highs yesterday as market
sentiment was boosted by news of a multi-billion-dollar merger in the
telecommunications industry, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 9.50 at 3,579.15 after climbing
above 3,590 at midsession. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
ended a net 2.24 stronger at 452.38, while the American SE composite gained
2.25 at 441.33. The Nasdaq composite reached a record 726.89 with a rise of
8.63. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 233.6m shares.
Although equity prices declined at the opening, the fall was a reflection of
the impact of dividend payouts on several Dow stocks. Once that had been
digested, prices quickly began to climb across the board, aided by further
declines in bond yields.
The day's big story was the news that AT&amp;T was to buy all of McCaw Cellular
Communications in a stock-swap worth Dollars 12.6bn. Although the
development was not totally unexpected - AT&amp;T already owns a significant
stake in McCaw - the arrival of a huge corporate transaction was welcomed by
equity investors.
AT&amp;T fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 60 3/4 on the news, while McCaw jumped
Dollars 5 to Dollars 56 1/4 in volume of more than 7.4m shares on the Nasdaq
market. Lin Broadcasting, a cellular operator majority-owned by McCaw,
forged ahead Dollars 12 3/4 to Dollars 115.
Overall, prices may also have been supported by the day's economic news,
which consisted of a 0.4 per cent rise in July industrial production and a
small increase in capacity utilisation from 81.3 per cent to 81.5 per cent.
Salomon advanced Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 48 after Mr Warren Buffett, the
billionaire investor and former Salomon chairman, notified the government
authorities that he planned to take his stake in the company, currently at
14.3 per cent, over the 15 per cent mark. Analysts said the move was a vote
of confidence in Salomon.
Aluminum Company of America led blue chips higher, rising Dollars 2 1/4 to
Dollars 73 7/8 in busy trading. Other metals stocks, especially gold
companies, were also firmer, with Newmont Mining putting on Dollars 1 at
Dollars 48 7/8 and Battle Mountain Gold Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 9 1/4 .
On the Nasdaq market, Snapple Beverage climbed Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 43
3/4 after declaring a two-for-one stock split as a 100 per cent dividend.
Canada
TORONTO finished narrowly mixed after light trading. The TSE 300 index was
finally 5.6 firmer at 4,020.2 but declining issues slightly exceeded rises
by 341 to 339. Volume was 43.6m shares valued at CDollars 450.9m. Seven of
the 14 sub-group indices closed lower, led by real estate, off 1.1 per cent.
