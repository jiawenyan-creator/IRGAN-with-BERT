FT  09 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q &amp; A: Woodland in trust
MY WIFE and I plan to make a deed of gift so that on our deaths about 20
acres of natural woodland passes to a local wildlife trust. We would like
the woodland to be maintained by the trust in its natural state and would
like to include a clause in the deed of gift to the effect that, if the
trust should sell the land, then the proceeds would go to three or four
charities equally, but none of the proceeds of the sale would go to the
wildlife trust.
Our solicitor tells us (but we do not believe him) that we cannot include
such a clause when we make a gift of this nature.
You could achieve your objective by a more elaborate provision, namely
setting up a trust for the use of the wildlife trust so long as the land is
retained in its natural state, with a gift over to the other charities if
the land ceases to be so maintained.
