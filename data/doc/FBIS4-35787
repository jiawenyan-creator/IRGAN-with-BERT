  [Text] Jeddah, 5 Jun (SPA) -- The ICO Secretary General 
Hamid al-Ghabid expressed the ICO's deep concern over the recent 
Israeli attacks against southern Lebanon. 
  In a statement issued by the organization today, he said 
that 
these attacks, which were strong, barbaric, and do not respect 
human life, represent a blatant violation of international law; 
they provide further evidence on the motives of hegemony as 
practiced by Israel in its international relations. 
  Dr. al-Ghabid strongly condemned the air hostilities and the 
mobilization of land forces to launch more aggressive acts. He 
believes that the continuation of such barbaric acts could 
seriously hamper the peace process in the Middle East and would 
make it difficult to reach any satisfactory results. 
  He appealed to the UN Security Council to take into account 
these serious developments and called on the co-sponsors of the 
peace process to use their influence and exert maximum efforts 
to save the peace process.
