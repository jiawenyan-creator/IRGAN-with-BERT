  [Text] Father Yvon Massac, Fermathe parish priest, seeks to 
restore Aristide. He asks U.S. President Bill Clinton to provide 
for the deployment of a UN mission to Haiti. In an open letter 
dated 7 January to the U.S. President, the Fermathe parish 
priest reiterates his request for a total, complete blockade, 
including a rigorous watch on the Haitian-Dominican border, as 
the means of resolving the Haitian crisis. The international 
community must act effectively and quickly so the suffering of 
the deprived masses can end, says Father Massac, who enjoins Mr. 
Clinton to put pressure on the military authorities to restore 
the president-in-exile within three months. 
  [Begin Massac recording, in Creole] The people ask you not 
to 
encourage any reconciliation conference in the midst of a 
concert of gunshots. The fact is that the coupists do not want 
reconciliation. They want power through blood so they can 
plunder. Order and safety must be restored before any national 
conference can be held in Haiti. 
  Secondly, the Haitian people are weighed down by an embargo 
on human rights. That is why they ask you to make the UN embargo 
and blockade total and complete, and to block the border between 
Haiti and the Dominican Republic so we can be done quickly with 
the sufferings of the coup. 
  Third, concerning the assistance of other countries in 
resolving the crisis, do not let the United States do anything 
by itself in Haiti, especially regarding Army reforms and 
military intervention. [end recording] 
  That was Father Yvon Massac, Fermathe parish priest.
