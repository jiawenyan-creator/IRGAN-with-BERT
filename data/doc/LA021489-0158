NATION; 
POLL FINDS HEALTH CARE DISCONTENT 
Americans are substantially more dissatisfied with their health care system 
than either the British or Canadians are with theirs, and would prefer a 
government-controlled system similar to the Canadian model, according to a 
survey released today. 
In the first simultaneous survey ever conducted of public attitudes toward 
health care in the United States, Britain and Canada, only 10% of Americans 
said their nation's health care system works "pretty well" and needs only minor 
changes. But 56% of Canadians and 27% in Britain thought their systems worked 
"pretty well." The survey was conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health 
and the Louis Harris polling organization.
