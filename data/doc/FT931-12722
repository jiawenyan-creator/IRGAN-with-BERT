FT  27 JAN 93 / Rouble in sharp fall against Dollars
THE rouble plunged 15 per cent yesterday to a record low of Rbs568 against
the dollar amid concern over Russia's loose monetary policy. A record
Dollars 84.83m changed hands on Moscow's tiny Inter-bank Currency Exchange
in a longer than usual session of over an hour.
The fall increases pressure on the Russian central bank and the government
to agree on common action to strengthen the currency.
The central bank spent about Dollars 40m intervening in the currency
exchange yesterday. Demand for foreign currency at the auction, which is
held twice a week, was double the amount on offer when trading opened. This
forced the central bank to drive the rate down to Rbs568 from an opening
level of Rbs493, and even then to provide half the hard currency sold in
order to meet demand.
At the start of the year the rouble traded at 417 to the dollar. A central
bank official said the bank's only chance of stabilising the exchange rate
would be sharply to increase interest rates although he could not say
whether this would happen. Its equivalent of the discount rate is still at
80 per cent a year, although inflation has now reached 10 per cent a week.
