  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui 
departed Wednesday [9 February] morning for Southeast Asia, 
embarking on a week-long private vacation journey to the 
Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand. 
  In his unofficial visit to Subic Bay, the first leg of the 
trip, Li will meet Philippine President Fidel Ramos over a 
luncheon and visit the bay area, where a major industrial 
processing zone exclusively for Taiwan investors will soon be 
developed. 
  Li and his entourage, which includes Foreign Affairs 
Minister 
Fredrick Chien [Chien Fu], chief economic planner Hsiao 
Wan-chang, and some business leaders, will arrive Wednesday 
evening in Bali, Indonesia where they will stay for a five-day 
vacation. 
  An unofficial meeting with President Suharto is part of Li's 
itinerary in Indonesia. 
  Li will also meet with Indonesian Research and Technology 
Minister Jusuf Bacharuddin Habibie for talks focusing on the 
development of Batam, an island south of Singapore which Jakarta 
is developing as an industrial zone. 
  Li, his wife and party are scheduled to leave Bali and 
travel 
to Phuket in Thailand on Feb. 14 for a two-day visit. 
  The president's economically significant vacation trip is 
scheduled to end on Feb. 16. 
  The presidential office has given low-key treatment to Li's 
"southern trip", apparently to shield the three Southeast Asian 
countries from any diplomatic embarrassment they might suffer 
because of their official links with Beijing.
