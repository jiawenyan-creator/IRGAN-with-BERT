FISHING; 
LOTS OF BIG BONITO HITTING THE HOOKS AT ROCKY POINT AND CATALINA ISLAND 
Big bonito have invaded sectors of Rocky Point and Catalina Island. If the 
surface water conditions remain steady, anglers can look forward to a wide-open 
bite of the fighting boneheads. 
Boats fishing Rocky Point have scored with the fighting fish going from six to 
eight pounds. 
Mickey Halderman of Long Beach, fishing on the Victory, caught a 12 1/2-pounder 
on 10-pound test line. 
At Catalina, boats report the explosive run has been going on for a week, with 
plenty of yellowtail showing but refusing both bait and jigs. 
The Venice Anglers third annual shark derby was held last weekend with 300 
anglers participating. 
The three top catches were made at the Redondo Canyon area. Duane McCutchin of 
Redondo Beach caught a 134-pound mako from his boat the Full Force. It was 
worth $2,500. 
Don Snyder of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard his boat the Sea Wolf, caught a 
122-pound mako that awarded him a week's fishing at Cabo San Lucas. Jason Tress 
was also aboard the Full Force and his 109-pound catch awarded the Redondo 
Beach angler complete tackle. 
Another shark derby will be held Saturday and Sunday, sponsored by Southern 
California Enterprises. This Marina del Rey derby raises funds for the Muscular 
Dystrophy Assn. 
Fishing will be from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. both days. Morning roll call will be at 
Frenchy's sportfishing landing at 6. The Union 76 fuel dock at Bora Bora Way 
will be the weigh-in station. Four anglers will be allowed per boat with 
registration at $200. For information, call (619) 723-7470. 
Vera Sampson of Harbor City, fishing aboard the American Angler at Benitos 
Island off Mexico, had to work for her catch. 
Using a live mackerel, she made a cast toward yellowtail that were chasing 
bait. A yellow hit and headed to the rocks. Turning, the fish peeled all of her 
25-pound test Izor line. Once around the deck she stopped it down. 
After 32 minutes the yellow surfaced and again Sampson had to reel quickly as 
seals were charging her fish. A deckhand with gaff ready beat the seals to a 
meal. 
Sampson won the jackpot when her catch weighed in at 46 1/2 pounds. 
Nick Thompson is only 6 years old but this San Pedro boy showed the veterans 
how it is done aboard the Matt Walsh Monday morning. While the anglers were 
catching bass, Thompson hooked and landed two big barracuda. The fish weighed 
seven and eight pounds each. Nick said he is going to save his money and enter 
the jackpot the next time he goes fishing.
