</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is reopening the comment period for a proposed rule for Early Reductions Permits published in the 

Federal Register

 of December 29, 1993 (58 FR 68804). Several persons who intend to submit comments concerning the proposed rule for
Early Reductions Permits requested additional time to prepare their responses, beyond the 30 days originally provided.
In consideration of these requests, EPA is reopening the comment period in order to give all interested persons the
opportunity to comment fully.

The comment period is reopened. Comments must be received on or before March 3, 1994.

Docket No. A9308, containing supporting information used in developing the proposed rule is available
for public inspection and copying between 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, at EPA's Air Docket, room

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Comments on the proposed rule were to be received on or before January 28, 1994 (a 30 day comment period). The comment
period is reopened until March 3, 1994. This extension of the comment period is consistent with Executive Order 12866,
which states that ``each agency should afford the public a meaningful opportunity to comment on any proposed regulation,
which in most cases should include a comment period of not less than 60 days.'' Reopening the comment period until March
3, 1994 will provide the public slightly more than the suggested 60 days.
