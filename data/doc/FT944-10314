FT  11 NOV 94 / Open-ended funds framework set out
The Treasury yesterday set out part of the regulatory framework it intends
to put in place for open-ended investment companies when they are allowed in
the UK next year.
OEICs are a different form of pooled investment funds from unit trusts. They
are common in other European countries and in north America, where investors
are unfamiliar with unit trusts, and their introduction into the UK is
intended to help British fund managers compete more effectively.
Among the significant elements to the regime will be that OEICs will be able
to include 'umbrella funds' and that 'bearer shares' will also be allowed.
Both are allowed, but rarely used, in unit trusts.
Umbrella funds - through which an OEIC is made up of a number of sub-funds -
give fund managers the marketing opportunity of offering investors the
ability to switch from one fund to another more cheaply than otherwise.
