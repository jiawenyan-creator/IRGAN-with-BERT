FT  22 APR 94 / Campaign Diary: Wales is ruled out of move to curb cars
Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, has decided that the Department of the
Environment's latest planning guidance, aimed at curbing the growing use of
cars, should not apply in Wales.
It is believed he is concerned that the guidelines could hinder economic
regeneration in the country and that the rural nature of much of Wales
should be taken into account. He has asked the Welsh Office to draw up its
own guide-lines.
The DoE issued the guidelines, PPG13, to local authorities last month as
part of its policy to discourage out-of-town development which depends upon
car use.
