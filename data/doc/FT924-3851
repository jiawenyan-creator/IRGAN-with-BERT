FT  05 DEC 92 / Statistics warn of further falls
A SMALL fall in the Central Statistical Office's shorter leading index,
which indicates turning points in the economy about four months in advance,
suggests further falls in output before the end of the year.
The latest cyclical indicators from the CSO point to more bad news ahead of
Christmas and in the new year, but a rise in the economy later next year.
The longer leading indicator, which locates turning points about 10 months
in advance, moved upwards in September and October.
The coincident indicator was slightly higher in September and October. It
reflected some upturn in the production industries and retail sales.
