ODYSSEY: THE AUTHORISED BIOGRAPHY OF ARTHUR C. CLARKE by Neil McAleer
Gollancz Pounds 16.99, 430 pages
HE is perhaps the only man in the world who can be designated unambiguously
by a four-digit number. He drives a solar-powered Sinclair C5 scooter and he
recruited George Bernard Shaw to the ranks of the British Interplanetary
Society. He is Arthur C. Clarke, the author of 2001 and the colossus of
science fiction, who strides through the pages of Neil McAleer's Odyssey
with an oddly comical gait.
To McAleer's credit, he makes clear in his preface that this book is only a
spectre of the one which might be written about his subject one day.
Clarke's intimate personal journals, presently sealed in an iron box, may
provide a biographer in a distant future with material to flesh out and
bring his subject to life.
In the meantime, despite the 'nine feet of print resources and dozens of
taped interviews' which declaredly went into the preparation of this volume,
Clarke as a character in these pages remains as remote and as lifeless as an
asteroid.
Stanley Kubrick, we are informed ominously in the same preface, is on record
as pronouncing that 'Arthur is not an anecdotable character.' So, the tone
is set for this altogether too-timid portrait of a man who, among other
claims to fame, foresaw the rise of modern global telecommunications in his
anticipation of geo-stationary satellites.
McAleer seems so unremittingly in awe of his subject that the effect is to
dull a topic which might have been fascinating. The text veers between
Pravda-like pronouncements of Arthur's greatness and Boswellian dinner party
snippets.
