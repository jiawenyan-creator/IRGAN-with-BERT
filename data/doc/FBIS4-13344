  [Text] Cairo, April 19 (MENA)--Public Prosecutor Raja' 
al-'Arabi today asserted the prosecution's abidance by doing its 
role in accordance with legitimacy and supremacy of law without 
ignoring guarantees enjoyed by individuals. 
  This came in a message he sent to the Press Syndicate in 
reply to a note he received of late from Ibrahim Nafi', chairman 
of the Press Syndicate, requesting the prosecution's 
interference to protect guarantees of journalists who were 
arrested recently. 
  The Press Syndicate Board charged that the prosecution had 
violated such guarantees recently. 
  "All the prosecution members are fully aware, and have 
proper 
understanding, of all rulings and laws, including the authority 
of the press and criminal procedures," asserted the chief 
prosecutor. 
  "The prosecution is keen on implementing laws out of its 
responsibility and duties without the need for anyone to draw 
its attention to that," he affirmed.
