FT  22 APR 94 / 800 jobs go as Texas Instruments closes down in Bedford
Texas Instruments of the US, one of the world's largest electronics
companies, is closing down its operations in Bedford with the loss of 800
jobs.
The company, Bedford's largest manufacturing employer, has been in the town
30 miles north of London for 38 years. At its peak in the 1970s, Texas
employed 3,500 people in the UK. After the withdrawal from Bedford, only 500
jobs will remain.
The move is part of a worldwide restructuring plan put in place by Texas to
rationalise its manufacturing operations. It said the object was 'to achieve
sustainable levels of profitability after several years of unsatisfactory
performance'. It intends to concentrate the manufacturing of its important
product lines in France, Germany and Italy.
A result is that up to 50 of Britain's top electronics engineers will find
themselves being offered jobs in France, Germany and at the company's
headquarters in Dallas, Texas.
Some 400 administrative jobs at Bedford are to go, starting in August. A
further 200 positions will be relocated elsewhere in the UK. The only
operations remaining at Bedford will be a power transistors plant employing
200 people. Texas intends to find a buyer to take total or partial ownership
of this operation.
One reason Texas decided to pull out of Bedford is that although most
aspects of its operations were represented, it was not a centre of
excellence for any of its main products.
Mr Mike Gwilliam, Bedfordshire's chief planning council officer, said: 'You
can say we are totally dismayed. It is not just a question of the jobs lost.
Texas was the kind of flagship, high technology company we were very much
hoping to retain.'
