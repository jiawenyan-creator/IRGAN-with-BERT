SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN GABRIEL; 
PARK IMPROVEMENTS OKD 
The City Council on Tuesday approved a $100,000 project for reconstructing 
restrooms at two city parks. 
The project, paid for with a state park conservation grant, will include water 
conservation equipment and graffiti-proofing at Vincent Lugo and Smith parks. 
Also, starting Oct. 18, charitable organizations in the city will be required 
to renew their solicitation permits only once a year. 
The council amended the current regulation that requires nonprofit 
organizations to renew permits every month. City officials said the monthly 
requirement was too time-consuming.
