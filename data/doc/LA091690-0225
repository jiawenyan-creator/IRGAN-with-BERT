GALANTER CRITICISM CALLED 'CHEAP SHOT' 
Letter-writer Steve Schlein recently complained (Times, Sept. 2) about the city 
of Los Angeles' bungled handling of permit applications for a project in his 
(and my) Venice beachfront neighborhood. 
For the most part, he was right in his criticism of the way the city Planning 
Department and Department of Transportation processed the application too 
slowly, leading to the unconditional approval of a controversial proposal. 
But he reveals his true motive for writing with his parting shot at 
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter ("(She) has not shown any interest in finding out 
exactly why this happened"). This is a flat-out dishonest remark, particularly 
when considered in the context of your previous coverage of the story, which 
notes her concern with the situation. 
I also know he's wrong because I'm her staff person assigned to work on the 
case in question. 
Councilwoman Galanter has been very active in trying to get to the bottom of 
this annoying and perplexing case. At her direction, I've been exploring why 
and how it happened, how it can be prevented in the future, and how best to 
handle this case as it goes on. 
Representatives of our office have spoken with the city attorney, several top 
executives in the Planning Department, no less than four zoning administrators 
and several other Planning Department staffers, a lawyer from the state 
attorney general's office, Coastal Commission staff members, numerous community 
residents, and the developer's attorney, who precipitated the crisis by 
invoking the state law in the first place. 
Councilwoman Galanter has formally requested a response to a number of crucial 
issues the case raises. She is obviously interested in doing a lot more than 
just finding out why it happened, contrary to Schlein's disinformative cheap 
shot.
