ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; 
ERROR CONCEDED, BUT BALLOT WON'T CHANGE 
The county registrar of voters admits he goofed by letting Saddleback Valley 
school board appointee Roberta Cline list herself as a "governing board member" 
on the Nov. 6 ballot. 
But Registrar Donald Tanney said it's too late to change it. 
Cline, who was appointed to the school board on July 11, did not inform Tanney 
that she was an appointee when she requested the incumbent designation, he 
said. But school district officials previously had notified the registrar's 
office of Cline's appointment. 
"There's no question we made an error here in this department," Tanney said. 
"We had knowledge she was appointed; my staff should not have allowed her to 
use the governing board member designation." 
But with the election just five weeks away, it's too late to reprint the 
ballots. The county will issue a public notice correcting the error, and county 
lawyers are trying to determine if the county is liable for the error, Tanney 
said. 
Registrar officials discovered the mistake after school board candidate Charles 
Wall charged that Cline had violated district election laws and was falsely 
representing herself as an incumbent by using the title. 
"Someone who was appointed just a few months before the election should not 
have an unfair advantage over the rest of the challengers," Wall said. 
But Cline said she had never heard of the ordinance and was told by the 
registrar employees to use the title. 
"There's no way I want to mislead anyone," Cline said. Ironically, Cline 
recently received a joint endorsement along with Wall from the district's 
classified employees union. But Cline said she hopes that the endorsement will 
not pair her with Wall in voters' minds. 
"I want to distance myself from (Wall's) campaign. I'm concerned about a 
negative approach from someone who hasn't shown a great deal of involvement in 
the schools up to this point." CHERYLANNE BEALER
