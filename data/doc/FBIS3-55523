  [Text] Yuzho-Sakhalinsk January 9 TASS -- The Sakhalin and 
Kuril islands expect a growth in political activity in the 
second half of the winter, due to elections to the new regional 
parliament, scheduled for March 20 1993. 
  In accordance with Regional Governor Yevgeniy Krasnoyarov's 
order, the parliament will consist of two chambers, the Regional 
Council and the Regional Duma. The council will consist of 17 
deputies who will continue to hold their regular jobs while 
fulfilling their representative functions. The duma will 
consist of 13 full-time representatives. 
  Local observers predict, with a few reservations, that the 
March elections will be similar to the national December 
elections in that most of the islanders will vote primarily for 
the person, not his party or his programme. It would not be 
surprising if most of the seats in the regional council go to 
leading figures in the municipal and regional administrations or 
their proteges. 
  In contrast to the upcoming electoral activity, the 
political 
thermometer on the Sakhalin and Kuril islands has been around 
zero for the past five months. The few representatives of 
different parties, blocs, and movements have had practically no 
effect on the lives of the islanders.
