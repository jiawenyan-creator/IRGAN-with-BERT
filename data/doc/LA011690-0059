METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE DELAYS HEARING ON CITYHOOD UNTIL JAN. 
31 
A judge has postponed until Jan. 31 a hearing in a lawsuit filed by Malibu 
cityhood supporters, who want to force the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors to set a date for an incorporation election in Malibu. 
Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs, who was to have heard final arguments in 
the case today, postponed the hearing at the request of lawyers for a cityhood 
opponent who said they needed more time to prepare their arguments. 
Incorporation backers have accused the supervisors of violating a state law 
that allows them 60 days from when they begin hearing the cityhood matter to 
conclude the hearing as a final step before setting an election. The 
supervisors began the hearing Oct. 19, but later voted to postpone indefinitely 
a decision on incorporation until construction permits are issued for a sewer 
system the county wants built in Malibu.
