The above numbers will be revised in the final rule to the 
extent required to reflect the updated MedPAR file, which 
will contain data from additional bills received for 
discharges through September 30, 1993. 

For the benefit of hospitals seeking to qualify as 
referral centers or those wishing to know how their case-mix 
index value compares to the criteria, we are publishing each 
hospital's FY 1993 case-mix index value in Table 3C in 
section V of the addendum to this proposed rule. In keeping 
with our policy on discharges, these case-mix index values 
are computed based on all Medicare patient discharges 
subject to DRG-based payment. 



2. Discharges 



Section 412.96(c)(2)(i) provides that HCFA will set 
forth the national and regional numbers of discharges in 
each year's annual notice of prospective payment rates for 
purposes of determining referral center status. As 
specified in section 1886(d)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act, the 
national standard is set at 5,000 discharges. However, we 
are proposing to update the regional standards. The 
proposed regional standards are based on discharges for 
urban hospitals' cost reporting periods that began during 
FY 1992 (that is, October 1, 1991 through 
September 30, 1992). That is the latest year for which we 
have complete discharge data available. 

Therefore, in addition to meeting other criteria, we 
are proposing that to qualify for initial rural referral 
center status for cost reporting periods beginning on or 
after October 1, 1994, the number of discharges a hospital 
must have for its cost reporting period that began during 
FY 1993 would have to be at least_

&bull;5,000; or 

&bull;Equal to the median number of discharges for urban 
hospitals in the census region in which the hospital is 
located, as indicated in the table below.
