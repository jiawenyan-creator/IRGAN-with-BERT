FT  24 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Zeneca set for Dollars 300m
Yankee bond offering
ZENECA Group, the bioscience business recently demerged from ICI, is set to
launch a Dollars 300m issue of 10-year Yankee bonds in the US market, writes
Tracy Corrigan.
The proceeds will be used to repay some of the company's Dollars 850m debt
to the ICI Group.
The refinancing will allow the company to substantially reduce interest
costs, since the average coupon on the existing debt, maturing in 2002, is
9.2 per cent, while the coupon on the Yankee bonds is likely to be below 7
per cent.
The ICI debt can be repaid without penalty at any time after January 4 1994,
so the Yankee bond proceeds will be added to general corporate funds ahead
of repayment early next year.
Zeneca already has a shelf registration with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission, following a Dollars 1.3bn issue.
