FT  25 MAY 94 / Postal union to vote on strikes
Post Office workers are to be balloted on industrial action in protest at
closures of main offices, the main postal union decided yesterday.
More than 11,000 members of the Union of Communication Workers will vote on
action including strikes.
The move was agreed at the union's annual conference in Bournemouth where
delegates heard that 750 main post offices have closed in the past five
years as counter services have been franchised out to shops or supermarkets.
The move has led to the loss of 6,000 jobs, although there have been no
compulsory redundancies.
