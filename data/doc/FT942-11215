placing tag
Vymura, the wallcoverings group which was originally part of ICI, has
resisted the slide in new issue pricing and is to be valued at Pounds 38.6m
via a placing price of 150p.
Mr David Simpson, a director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Vymura's sponsor and
financial adviser, said the price was exactly as planned when the flotation
was first announced six weeks ago.
'We have been seeing some softening of prices but there is still an appetite
for quality new issues.'
He added that in Vymura's case there was a comparable quoted company, Fine
Decor, whose share price has not weakened in the past few weeks.
The placing price represents 14.5 times last year's earnings per share.
The notional yield is 3.7 per cent, slightly higher than Fine Decor.
BZW is placing a total of Pounds 24.1m of shares, raising a net Pounds 10m
for the company.
Just over half the new money will be used to repay preference shares held by
institutions that backed a management buy-out in 1992.
UBS are brokers to the issue. Dealings are expected to start next Thursday.
