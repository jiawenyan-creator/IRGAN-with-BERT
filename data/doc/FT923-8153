FT  13 AUG 92 / Letter: Not a tiny computer company
Sir, With reference to your article on personal computers of July 17
(Management: 'Customers form queue for chips in newspapers') I would like to
clarify what is obviously a misunderstanding about Opus Technology.
The article indicates that Opus is a 'tiny company' with British Rail as its
largest customer. I would just like to point out that Opus has a turnover of
Pounds 55m, only some Pounds 5m short of Elonex, employs some 170 people and
has an installed computer base of some 300,000 systems. We were also rated
by the consultants Romtec and Dataquest to be equal No 1 in direct sales,
only a few points behind Elonex in the total PC market and ahead of Dell,
Tandon, etc.
Also, British Rail is not Opus's largest customer, as stated in your
article, and, although being a major user of Opus systems, makes up less
than 12 per cent of our total business. Opus has a corporate base which
includes some very large names and accounts for 45 per cent of Opus
business.
Finally, I would mention that Opus is one of the few (if not the only)
companies which manufacture and fully meet BS7002/IEC950 Health &amp; Safety
approval.
