Airworthiness Directives; Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 Series Airplanes

ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes, that requires replacement of the 
autopilot disconnect switches with modified units. This amendment is prompted by 
several incidents in which the flight crew did not depress both halves of the autopilot 
disconnect switch during the LAND 2 or LAND 3 approach and, as a result, one autopilot 
remained engaged. This condition resulted in unanticipated movements of the stabilizer 
trim and higher than anticipated control forces of the flight controls. The actions 
specified by this AD are intended to prevent the flight crew from inadvertently 
disconnecting only one autopilot when both autopilots are engaged, which could result in 
unanticipated control surface movements.

 
</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Effective October 21, 1994.


The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is 
approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of October 21, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes was published in the 


Federal Register

 on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24383). That action proposed to require 
replacement of the autopilot disconnect switches with modified units. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 
Both commenters support the proposed rule. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, 
the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the 
rule as proposed. 
The FAA estimates that 19 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
that it will take approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required 
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost 
approximately $2,500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the 
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $55,860, or $2,940 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.
