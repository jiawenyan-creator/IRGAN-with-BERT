Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China: Notice of Court Decision; Exclusion From the Application of the
Antidumping Duty Order, in Part; Termination of Administrative Reviews; and Amended Final Determination and Order



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of amendment to amended final determination of sales at less-than-fair-value, exclusion from the application
of the amended antidumping duty order, and termination of administrative reviews in accordance with decision upon
remand.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On January 5, 1994, the United States Court of International Trade (``CIT'') affirmed the Department's May 14, 1993,
remand determination without comment. See 

CEC Electrical Manufacturing (Int'l) Company Ltd. 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 942 (CIT January 5, 1994). The remand resulted in a finding of a 

de minimis 

margin for CEC Electrical Manufacturing (International) Company, Ltd./CEC Industries (Shenzhen) Ltd./CEC (USA)
Texas Group, Inc. (``CEC'') and, consequently, a negative determination of sales at less than fair value for the investigation
of CEC. Therefore, CEC is excluded from the application of the antidumping duty order on ceiling fans from the People's
Republic of China (``PRC''). Because CEC is excluded from the application of the antidumping duty order, we are also
terminating both ongoing administrative reviews with respect to CEC. In addition, the exclusion of CEC results in
a change in the all others rate.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background: 


On June 5, 1991, the Department published its Preliminary Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Oscillating
Fans and Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China (56 FR 25664). In that determination, the Department found
CECs weighted-average dumping margin for the ceiling fans class or kind of merchandise to be 0.37 percent, 

de minimis. 

(CEC was not identified as a producer or exporter of products within the oscillating fans class or kind of merchandise.)
However, in the final determination the Department found CEC's weighted-average dumping margin for the ceiling
fans to be 2.70 percent. See Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Oscillating Fans and Ceiling Fans
From the People's Republic of China, 56 FR 55271 (October 25, 1991). Consequently, we instructed the U.S. Customs
Service to begin suspension of liquidation of all entries of ceiling fans manufactured by CEC entered into U.S. Customs
territory on or after October 25, 1991, the date of publication of the final determination. On December 9, 1991, the
Department published an amendment to its final determinations, and antidumping duty orders in this proceeding.
See Antidumping Duty Orders and Amendments to Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Oscillating
Fans and Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China, 56 FR 64240 (December 9, 1991) (``Fans LTFV Final and Order'').

CEC instituted an action at the CIT challenging the Department's final less-than-fair-value determination.

CEC Electrical, 

and on December 8, 1992, the CIT granted the Department's request. Pursuant to the court's order granting voluntary
remand, on May 14, 1993, the Department presented to the court the

A second respondent involved in the original investigation, Holmes/Esteem, instituted a separate challenge before
the CIT challenging the Department's final determination. 

Holmes Products Corp.  Esteem Industries, Ltd. 

v. 

United States, 

Court No. 911200906. That action has been resolved. 

See Oscillating Fans from the People's Republic of China: Notice of Court Decision, Retroactive Revocation of Antidumping
Duty Order, and Termination of Administrative Review, 

58 FR 30026 (May 25, 1993). As a result of the Department's May 25, 1993, action, the scope of these proceedings has been
reduced to a single class or kind of merchandise: ceiling fans. 
</FOOTNOTE>


In that remand redetermination, the Department considered four issues raised by CEC. These were:

 

1. Double-counting of certain inputs in the downrod assembly; 
2. Double-counting of the raw material input in the paddle brackets;
