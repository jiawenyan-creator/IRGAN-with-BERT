  [Text] Poland's Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski sent a 
letter today to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wladyslaw Klaczynski told us. 
  [Begin Klaczynski recording] Minister Olechowski stressed 
Poland's concern caused by the present situation in Crimea and a 
possibility that an internal Ukrainian problem could become an 
international conflict. Poland is in favor of a peaceful 
resolution of the dispute within the framework of the democratic 
legal order, and it reiterates its support for Ukraine's 
independence and territorial integrity. 
  Poland counts, as Minister Olechowski writes in his letter, 
upon a similar position by all the CSCE states, but it is 
attaching particular importance to the position of the United 
States and Russia, which have pledged to guarantee the 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Poland is 
also convinced as to the good will of Ukraine's Government and 
its readiness to find a peaceful and democratic solution to this 
dangerous dispute. [end recording]
