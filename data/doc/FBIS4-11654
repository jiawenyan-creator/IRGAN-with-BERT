  [Text] Cairo, March 30 (AFP) -- Israeli and PLO negotiators 
broke off talks here Wednesday [30 March] after failing to reach 
agreement on plans to protect Palestinians in the mosque 
massacre town of Hebron, a diplomatic source said. 
  The two sides met for several hours before suspending the 
talks, which were aimed at finalising agreement on deploying 
Palestinian police and international observers in Hebron. 
  The negotiators had been unable to reach any compromise and 
were dissatisfied with each other's proposals, the source said. 
  "An Egyptian mediator is shuttling between them to try to 
get 
them back around the table," said the source, who did not give 
specific reasons for the breakdown. 
  The delegations are trying to reach agreement on ways to 
protect Palestinians in Hebron, where a Jewish settler killed 30 
Arab worshippers on February 25. 
  An accord would allow the resumption of talks on launching 
Palestinian autonomy, which have been suspended since the 
massacre.
