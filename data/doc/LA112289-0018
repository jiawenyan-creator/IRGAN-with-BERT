NBA ROUNDUP; 
HAWKS END PISTONS' HOME WINNING STREAK AT 25 
There is an alarming trend in the NBA. In the first month of the new season, 
home teams are winning almost 75% of the games. 
That was the situation in the early years of pro basketball, and owners felt it 
was a good thing because it built attendance. 
That is not the case anymore. With most teams televising their road games, a 
million or so fans see them lose most of the time. Only 15,000 or so see them 
win at home. 
The season is not quite a month old, but only the Lakers (2-1) have a winning 
record away from home. 
That's part of the reason why the Atlanta Hawks' 103-96 victory over the 
Detroit Pistons Tuesday night at Auburn Hills was such a surprise. It ended the 
Pistons' 25-game winning streak at home. 
Amazingly, it was a rather easy victory. The Hawks, who were handled easily in 
their first two games of the season -- -- both at home -- -- raced in front 
early, and the Pistons didn't get closer than three points in the last three 
quarters. 
Moses Malone and John Battle sank seven of their first eight shots to help the 
Hawks to a 21-point lead in the first half. 
By scoring the last eight points in the half, the Pistons trailed, 63-50. Early 
in the third, they cut it to 70-67, but that was their final burst. 
Malone finished with 27 points and 11 rebounds. Isiah Thomas led the NBA 
champions (6-4) with 32 points. 
Portland 121, Chicago 110 -- Michael Jordan, hampered by the flu and tendinitis 
in his right knee, had only 16 points, and the Bulls lost their third 
consecutive game on their trip West. 
Despite Jordan's problems, the Bulls stayed close until the closing minutes in 
a game that was tied 28 times. Jordan was five for 13 from the field. 
The Bulls trailed, 95-94, with 9:12 left, but the Blazers scored eight points 
in a row. 
Indiana 119, Boston 111 -- The Pacers, cutting way back on their turnovers and 
getting a big game from Chuck Person, improved to 5-3 and are leading the 
Central Division. 
Person scored 18 of his 37 points in the fourth quarter at Indianapolis to hold 
off the Celtics. The Celtics are 1-5 on the road. 
Larry Bird scored eight points in an 18-7 Celtics' rally that cut the Indiana 
lead to 74-73. But Mike Sanders sank a jumper and Person took charge in the 
last 12 minutes. 
The Pacers had only six turnovers. 
Washington 97, Milwaukee 91 -- After losing their last five games on the trip 
West, the Bullets were happy to get home. 
Bernard King scored seven points in the last 2:38, and seldom-used Mel Turpin 
blocked three shots in the closing minutes to give the Bullets the win. 
New York 114, Houston 106 -- At New York, the first matchup between Patrick 
Ewing and Akeem Olajuwon was as advertised, but it was a move by Knick rookie 
Coach Stu Jackson that was decisive. 
With four minutes left in regulation, Jackson benched playmaker Mark Jackson in 
favor of Rod Strickland. Strickland directed the Knicks to an overtime victory. 
He had 10 points, a key steal from Olajuwon late in regulation and five 
assists. 
Utah 103, Minnesota 101 -- The Jazz, trailing most of the game at Minneapolis, 
had to go to overtime to avoid a loss to the expansion team. Karl Malone led 
the late rally and finished with 39 points. 
San Antonio 107, Phoenix 98 -- Rookie center David Robinson continues to 
perform to expectations for the Spurs. In this game at San Antonio, he had 20 
points and 15 rebounds. 
The Suns, playing without playmaker Kevin Johnson, are 0-4 on the road and 4-0 
at home. 
Miami 98, Charlotte 87 -- Former Laker Billy Thompson had his bridgework 
knocked out by the elbow of Hornet rookie J.R. Reid in the third quarter at 
Miami. Thompson scored 14 of his 25 points after the accident to lead the Heat 
to victory. 
Seattle 114, New Jersey 84 -- The SuperSonics, criticized by the Seattle media 
for lack of spirit, put on their best show of the season. 
The Sonics held the Nets to seven points in the third quarter and outscored the 
visitors, 65-25 in the second half. 
Orlando 115, Sacramento 113 -- Six teams have not won on the road. The 
expansion Magic are not one of them. With Jerry Reynolds scoring 28 points, the 
Magic improved to 2-3 on the road. 
Denver 111, Dallas 95 -- Alex English, finally out of Coach Doug Moe's 
doghouse, scored 18 points at Denver to lead the romp. Blair Rasmussen added 16 
points and 13 rebounds. DAN HAFNER
