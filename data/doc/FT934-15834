FT  09 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Rail privatisation - treading the
same stony path
Sir, You quote Mr Robert Horton, chairman of Railtrack - the new state
agency which will own the railway infrastructure after privatisation - as
justifying greater freedom from Treasury borrowing constraints on the
grounds that Railtrack's aim is to act as much as possible like a
commercially driven plc ('Greater financial freedom for Railtrack called
for', October 7).
The same plea could be made on behalf of British Rail, which has spent the
last 11 years reorganising itself as a commercially-driven, business-led
industry. Surely, the argument for continuing Treasury constraints on
nationalised industry expenditure is that the state remains the ultimate
guarantor of financial risk. This applies however the nationalised industry
is organised. In the government's eyes Railtrack can only be just another
nationalised industry monopoly, with all the pejorative overtones associated
with that title.
While the Treasury's new public sector leasing rules coming into effect next
year may introduce some private sector finance to the railways, it seems
that Mr Horton is following the stony path trodden by so many British Rail
chairmen in the past.
