FT  02 DEC 94 / Tough Canadian gun controls
Canada's Liberal government plans to require all gun owners to register
their weapons as part of proposed gun-control legislation which it claims
would be among the strictest in the world. The proposals have provoked an
outcry from hunters and the well-organised gun lobby. They also include an
outright ban on most types of military-style rifles and short-barrelled hand
guns. Sentences for crimes involving guns would be significantly stiffened.
The authorities would also gain extra powers to curb weapons smuggled into
Canada from the US.
Public opinion is strongly in favour of tighter controls, following several
well-publicised murders which have dented Canada's reputation as a
non-violent society. Mr Allan Rock, justice minister, said Canada should not
become a US-style society where many people own guns for self-defence.
