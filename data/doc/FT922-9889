FT  05 MAY 92 / Letter: Videophone not yet an answer for deaf people
Sir, Your otherwise excellent report on videophones, 'Phones with a view to
profit from vision' (April 28), was a rather more optimistic view of the
position of deaf people and the telephone network than is the case.
While many deaf people could benefit from videophones, to see a caller
speaking or using sign language, the standard of picture available from
systems now being introduced for use over the ordinary telephone network by
residential customers is unlikely to fulfil the communication requirements
of deaf people.
The Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), in conjunction with
University College London, has received partial funding from the European
Commission under its RACE (R&amp;D in Advanced Communications Technologies in
Europe) programme to undertake research into the application of video
telephony for deaf people. We shall be starting trials later this year with
a view to establishing some video telephony services for deaf people in 1994
within the constraints of available technology.
Yet video telephony is not a panacea for all deaf people as many do not use
sign language or lip read. There are also, for instance, those both deaf and
blind. Access for them must come from a different route.
On June 1 1992, TYPETALK, Europe's first national telephone relay service
will officially open in Britain, run by the RNID with Pounds 4m funding from
BT. The basis of the service is for a central operator to transcribe text
from a deaf person's text telephone into speech and speech into text. The
system is also capable of having the text translated into braille where
appropriate.
I am sure that research, including that of the RNID, will eventually lead to
video telephones assisting deaf people. Meanwhile, TYPETALK opens up the
network now.
