SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with Sections 2905 and 2906 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Public Law
103160 (Pryor Act Amendment) and with 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991) and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless
Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other
real property that HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using
information provided to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings
and real property controlled by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property.
This Notice is also published in order to comply with the April 21, 1993 Court Order in 

National Coalition for the Homeless

These properties reviewed are listed as suitable/available and unsuitable. In accordance with the Pryor Act Amendment
the suitable properties will be made available for use to assist the homeless.

Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Please be advised, in accordance with the provisions of the Pryor Act Amendment, that if no
expressions of interest or applications are received by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) during
the 60 day period, these properties will no longer be available for use to assist the homeless. In the case of buildings
and properties for which no such notice is received, these buildings and properties shall be available only for the
purpose of permitting a redevelopment authority to express in writing an interest in the use of such buildings and
properties. These buildings and properties shall be available for a submission by such redevelopment authority
exclusively for one year. Buildings and properties available for a redevelopment authority shall not be available
for use to assist the homeless. If a redevelopment authority does not express an interest in the use of the buildings
or properties or commence the use of buildings or properties within the applicable time period such buildings and
properties shall then be republished as properties available for use to assist the homeless pursuant to section 501
of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act.

Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression of interest to HHS,
addressed to Judy Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service, HHS, room 17A10,
5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 4432265. (This is not a toll-free number.) HHS will mail to the
interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the application. In
order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their written expressions
of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications, the reader is encouraged
to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).

Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this notice.
