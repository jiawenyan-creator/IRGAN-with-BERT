  [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- The Siberian city of 
Yakutsk is heavily guarded on Friday as an ultimatum to explode 
its major infrastructure facilites received from an unknown 
terrorist group expires. 
  A group called "Retribution", of which nobody had ever heard 
in Yakutsk, demanded to be paid 500,000 US dollars and 500 
million rubles threatening to explode life-supporting facilities 
of the city. 
  The Russian Interior Ministry told TASS that police in 
Yakutsk believe the threat is just a bluff; however, army 
experts joined police in a search for explosives. Special 
headquarters were created to monitor the situation and 
reinforced police units are patrolling the city. 
  Everything was quiet in Yakutsk as for 18.00 hours local 
time, Mayor Aleksey Tomtosov told TASS by telephone adding that 
all important objects are heavily guarded.
