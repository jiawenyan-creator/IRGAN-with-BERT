FT  30 AUG 94 / Observer: President who?
It is just a year from the presidential elections in Poland, and the present
incumbent Lech Walesa is growing restless. The opinion polls make gloomy
reading, so Walesa has gone in search of scapegoats.
The first casualty seems to be his faithful press spokesman Andrzej
Drzycimski, who has been dispatched on 'extended holiday'. Francis Cybula,
the president's chaplain and confessor since his days as a youthful trade
union leader, is also not expected to survive.
In the meantime, Walesa seems to reckon he can do better himself - at least
in the former capacity. Last week he dialed The Wprost with his personal
denial of a report carried in the weekly newspaper alleging he kept a number
of foreign bank accounts.
Understandably, the telephonist did not immediately twig as to the caller's
identity, and connected him with the sadly incomplete introduction: 'There's
a president on the phone.'
A flustered newsman attempted to explain away the confusion. 'All sorts
phone up giving themselves false titles to attract attention.'
