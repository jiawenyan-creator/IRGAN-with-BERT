(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1994, City 

A 

issues a 
fixed yield issue and invests all the sale proceeds of the issue 
($49 million). There are no other gross proceeds. The issue has 
a yield of 7.0000 percent per year compounded semiannually 
(computed on a 30 day month/360 day year basis). City 

A 

receives 
amounts from the investment and immediately expends them for the 
governmental purpose of the issue as follows:

(ii) 

First computation date. 

(A) City 

A

 chooses 
January 1, 1999, as its first computation date. This date is the 
latest date that may be used to compute the first required rebate 
installment payment. The rebate amount as of this date is 
computed by determining the future value of the receipts and the 
payments for the investment. The compounding interval is each 6-month (or shorter) period and the 30 day month/360
day year basis 
is used because these conventions were used to compute yield on 
the issue. The future value of these amounts, plus the computation credit, as of January 1, 1999, is:
