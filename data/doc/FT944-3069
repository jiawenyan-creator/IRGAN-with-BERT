FT  15 DEC 94 / Former defence secretary to lead security committee
Mr Tom King, a former Conservative defence secretary, was yesterday
appointed chairman of a cross-party parliamentary committee set up to
monitor the security services.
The committee, set up under the Intelligence Services Act, establishes a
measure of parliamentary control for the first time over the three security
services - MI5, the domestic intelligence service, MI6, its overseas
equivalent, and GCHQ, the electronic monitoring centre at Cheltenham.
The committee will scrutinise the expenditure, administration and policy of
the security services, but not operational planning or activities.
The committee, appointed by Mr John Major after consultation with Mr Tony
Blair, the Labour leader, comprises five Conservatives, three Labour MPs and
a Liberal Democrat.
The opposition members are: Mr Allan Rogers, a frontbench Labour spokesman
on foreign affairs; Mr Barry Jones, a former Labour Welsh office minister;
Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader; and Dr John Gilbert, a
former Labour transport minister. The Tories are: Mr King; Lord Howe, former
deputy prime minister; Sir Archie Hamilton, a former defence minister; Sir
Giles Shaw, a former trade and industry minister; and Mr Michael Mates, a
former Northern Ireland office minister.
