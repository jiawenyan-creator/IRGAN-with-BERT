FT  25 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Telefonica
Telefonica will be parading the virtues of its international arm when it
holds its pow-wow with GTE this week. The US telecoms operator is one of the
candidates to take a stake in the Spanish group's Tisa subsidiary, which
consists of shares in a collection of Latin American phone companies. AT&amp;T
and Unisource, an alliance of European operators of which Telefonica is a
member, are also candidates.
Strategic considerations will be important in choosing partners. A link-up
with GTE, which also has sizeable Latin American interests, would further
Telefonica's vision of creating a continent-wide system. A combined entity
would be better able to plan cross-border infrastructure and ensure that
most lucrative international calls were channelled over its networks.
Bringing in AT&amp;T and/or Unisource could advance Telefonica's other objective
of not being left on the edge of the big global alliances now hammered
together by BT, AT&amp;T and France Telecom/Deutsche Telekom. Given its
multiplicity of objectives, the Spanish group may try and sell stakes to all
three foreign groups.
If debt-laden Telefonica can sell each a 10 per cent stake in Tisa for the
Dollars 600m-Dollars 700m that is currently being bandied around, that would
be quite a coup. Not only would Tisa gain sufficient funds to build out its
franchises but Telefonica would also retain control.
