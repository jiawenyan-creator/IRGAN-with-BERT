  [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- The people in China 
have planted a total of 18 billion trees since the early 1950s, 
and the man-made afforested area amounts to 33 million ha, 
making it the world leader in this respect, according to the 
"CHINA ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL". 
  Obvious progress has been made in developing the 6.7-million 
ha fast-growing tree base, the northern China shelter belt, and 
the tree belts around the farmlands in the plains areas, on the 
middle and lower reaches of the Chang Jiang River, along the 
coastal areas, in the Taihang Mountains and in arid areas. 
  The professional paper noted that Guangdong, Fujian and 
Hunan 
Provinces have taken the lead in covering their barren mountains 
with trees. 
  The forestry departments, of which the gross output value 
rose from 2.52 billion yuan in 1952 to 140 billion yuan last 
year, offered several billion cu m of timber for national 
economic development, and expanded the afforested areas by more 
than 133 million ha. 
  According to Xu Youfang, minister of forestry, China will 
raise its tree coverage rate from the present 13.92 percent to 
15.3 percent in 1995 and that of cities to 25 percent.
