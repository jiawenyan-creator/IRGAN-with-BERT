    [Editorial Report] Norway has signed two agreements with 
Russia that will help prevent oil blowouts and other industrial 
accidents. 
  The daily AFTENPOSTEN of 25 May in Norwegian on page 6 
reported that the first agreement involves a collaborative 
effort between the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Norwegian 
Academy of Technical Sciences to create safety legislation for 
new installations in the oil sector. Russia has committed 30 
manpower years to the effort, and the Norwegian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs has granted 1.l million kroner to fund the 
Norwegian researchers involved in the project through 1994. 
  The second agreement involves a project for quality control 
requirements within the industry. Russia has committed 30 
manpower years to this project as well, and the Norwegian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs will spend 600,000 kroner on it. 
  An agreement for a collaborative project on risk analyses of 
the nuclear plants on the Kola peninsula is also planned. 
  The agreements are in response to a request by the Russian 
Academy of Sciences and took 18 months to work out.
