FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Japanese banks drop sharply
Japan's leading banks reported sharply lower profits yesterday as the
industry cut back on problem loans which it admitted would be a burden for
at least three more years.
The 11 leading commercial banks reported an average fall of 22.2 per cent in
pre-tax profits for the six months ended September, while non-performing
loans rose by an average of 9.6 per cent.
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the country's largest bank, suffered a 44.3 per cent
fall in net profit, blaming the decline on loan write-offs of Y164.2bn
(Dollars 1.5bn). The Bank of Tokyo was the only bank to report an increase
in net profit, partly a result of unusually low earnings last year.
The banks lifted provisions for losses, which have mostly arisen from
property-related lending during the 1980s, and they sold bad loans to the
Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, established to speed up the
write-offs.
The level of non-performing loans ranges from 1.9 per cent of loans at
Mitsubishi Bank to 5.39 per cent at Hokkaido Takushoku Bank. But the
institutions use a narrow definition and do not count the loans of
affiliates. It is estimated that the non-performing loans figure is about
double the Y9,248.4bn announced for the 11 banks yesterday. The fresh
provisions and write-offs, which totalled Y996.8bn, are a departure from
Japanese banking traditions and follow pressure from the Bank of Japan. It
fears bad loans are restricting the banks' ability to lend and slowing
economic recovery.
The banks have covered their loan losses through sales of equities, but the
weakness of Tokyo stock prices means they might book losses on securities
holdings over the second half to the end of March.
