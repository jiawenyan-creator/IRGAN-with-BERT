  [Text] The treacherous Israeli shelling of Frun has caused 
a major massacre. Three pregnant women -- Fatimah Hamdun, Muna 
Hayik, and Dalal Hayik -- were injured. Dalal Hayik died while 
undergoing surgery and was buried yesterday with her husband 
Hasan Ahmad Hayik, who was also martyred in the shelling. The 
two other injured women were evacuated to the American 
University of Beirut Hospital where the leg of Muna Hayik was 
amputated. The twins she was carrying died. Fatimah Hamdun's 
fetus also died. 
  Meanwhile, the Israeli attacks on the liberated areas 
continued. The hills of 'Arab Salim came under artillery 
shelling from the occupation forces' positions on the Tallat 
al-Dabshah. The southern quarter of the town also came under 
intensive machine-gun fire.
