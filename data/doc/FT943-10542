FT  04 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Harrisons &amp; Crosfield
Harrisons &amp; Crosfield shareholders have been waiting a long time for
something to turn up - the dividend, for example - and have managed to
contain their excitement at recent developments. Since Mr Bill Turcan moved
into the chief executive's chair in May, he has been making all the right
noises. He has announced a sensible removal of divisional management,
declared the company to be focused on chemicals and building supplies and
admitted that it still has a lot to prove. He has also been able to clinch
the sale of the Indonesian plantations at a price which brings minimal
earnings dilution. This means the company is under no pressure to gear up
again quickly with acquisitions in its two core businesses, which may be
just as well given its mixed record.
Not only did it buy its UK building merchant chains at the top of the
market, it also picked up a US chain which has seen half its business
undermined by new competition. The UK business showed a strong improvement
in the first half, largely by addressing management failings in the
south-east, but its margins of 4.7 per cent are still behind the competition
and way short of its target of 7.5 per cent. Its margins in speciality
chemicals are also below the industry leaders.
As always with Harrisons, this means there is plenty of upside if only the
management can deliver. Dividends should at last be covered this year but
the shares are still yielding 6.3 per cent, which suggests that expectations
are not high.
