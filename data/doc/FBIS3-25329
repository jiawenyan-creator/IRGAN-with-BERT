  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo], has once again said that the Mozambique 
Liberation Front [Frelimo] is not interested in holding the 
elections in October because this party needs more time to 
change its Marxist image. Dhlakama stressed that Frelimo is 
delaying the confinement of its soldiers because it is not 
interested in the holding of elections in October. He added 
that it is extremely dangerous to postpone elections, noting 
that the international community has already warned that the UN 
Operations in Mozambique cannot be maintained indefinitely.
