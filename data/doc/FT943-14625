FT  13 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Stores upset
Marks &amp; Spencer fell 6 to 400p as UBS featured the stock in a broad change
of heart over the retail sector.
The house moved its recommendation on the stores from overweight to neutral
and its stance on M &amp; S from buy to hold. UBS said the rising cost of raw
materials would be passed on to the retailers who have enjoyed a good run in
share price terms over the past year. Also it was uncertain whether those
price increases could be passed on to the consumer.
Elsewhere in the sector Kingfisher tumbled 12 to 512p and Boots 12 to 536p.
However, Great Universal Stores rose 7 to 574p ahead of figures tomorrow as
the market focused on the possibility that the company might buy back a
percentage of the shares in issue.

forecast by Pounds 3m to Pounds 167m and next year's by Pounds 9m to Pounds
173m citing dull trading in the UK and overseas competition.

Morris which announced that second quarter said that second quarter earnings
were up by 19.3 per cent. However the dollar-prompted pressure in the
afternoon saw the shares close 2 off at 410p.
Pharmaceuticals were generally weak took no solace from the latest statement
by Roche the Swiss group which warned that sales growth during the second
half would be slower than in recent years.
Dollar weakness played a significant part but Glaxo was also restrained by a
perception that it was falling behind in the race to capture US market share
following the purchase of a distributor by rival Eli Lilly. The shares fell
13 1/2 to 549 1/2 p.
SmithKline Beecham dropped 12 to 388p as traders said about a third of a 9m
share deal believed to have been carried out by Smith New Court still
lingered on the marketmaker's books.
ICI stood out with a rise of 8 to 777p. Mr Andrew Stott of Kleinwort Benson
said that the shares avoided being driven by the state of the US currency as
the chemicals company's dollar related sales were matched by raw material
costs.

recommendation by Goldman Sachs. The Goldman team was unable to comment as
they were taking part in an analysts' visit to a Courtaulds' site in
Germany. The latter's shares, which do react quite strongly to the dollar,
drifted 4 to 495p.
The oil majors moved in opposite directions with BP making good progress and
Shell coming under selling pressure in the wake of news of an escalation to
the strikes in the Nigerian oilfields.
Shell, down 3 1/2 at 694 1/2 p, suffered because of its substantial Nigerian
production interests, but BP moved up 4 1/2 to 384 1/2 p reflecting its high
gearing to a rising oil price. August Brent jumped 75 cents to Dollars 18.57
a barrel on the Nigerian strike news which analysts said could reduce global
oil output by around 1.9m barrels a day.

good and encouraging presentation with the company confident about the
trading outlook.' NatWest said it was reviewing its current profits forecast
of Pounds 270m, 'with a view to raising it.'
