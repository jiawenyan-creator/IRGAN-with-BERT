FT  10 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Indicators of doubt
It is a telling verdict on the chancellor's post-devaluation economic policy
that yesterday's retail price figures leave the market as much in the dark
as ever. At 4 per cent the underlying rate of inflation is only just within
the target range, which arguably creates no room for a further interest rate
cut. On the other hand, if Mr Lamont is in a cutting mood he could choose to
concentrate on the Halifax index, which shows house prices falling 'sharply'
to use his own phrase. Then again, sterling's strength could be grounds for
relaxation. It closed above DM2.51.
It is just possible that yesterday's Pounds 800m issue of short-dated gilts
could presage a base rate cut next week. Events have followed such a pattern
before. But it is more likely that the authorities will want to wait until
sterling has been stable for some time before rushing in. The new criteria
for monetary policy would have scarcely any credibility if they were
stretched to justify a rate cut so quickly after they had been announced. If
the chancellor were that desperate, he would surely have found an excuse to
cut before the Tory conference.
The equity market is thus probably right to have lowered its expectations.
But while it wrestles with domestic imponderables, it should not ignore
events overseas. D-Mark money rates may be softer, but there has been no US
rate cut; the election is looming; and Wall Street is looking vulnerable.
