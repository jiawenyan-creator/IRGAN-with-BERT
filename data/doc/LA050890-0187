SHORT TAKES; 
LIVING COLOUR BAND SUES FOX 
The Grammy-winning hard rock group Living Colour has sued Fox Broadcasting Co., 
claiming that the network's new "In Living Color" show stole the band's name 
and logo. 
The lawsuit, filed Friday in New York, seeks an injunction against Fox and 
producers of the Saturday night comedy as well as unspecified damages. 
"In Living Color" producer Tamara Rawitt declined to comment, as did Brad 
Turell, senior vice president of Fox. 
"In Living Color" has received rave reviews and was 29th in the ratings during 
its April 15 debut. 
Created by Keenen Ivory Wayans, who did the black satirical films "Hollywood 
Shuffle" and "I'm Gonna Git You, Sucka," "In Living Color" is a black version 
of "Saturday Night Live" that pokes fun at racial stereotypes with an almost 
all-black crew of comedians.
