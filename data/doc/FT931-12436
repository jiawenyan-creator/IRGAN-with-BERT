FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Two quit after American Express
'counter-coup'
THE depth of the boardroom battle at American Express, which led to Monday's
surprise announcement that Mr James Robinson had salvaged his job as
chairman, became apparent last night when two directors who had opposed Mr
Robinson said they were resigning.
Mr Rawleigh Warner, a long-time outside director and former chairman of
Mobil, resigned - effective immediately - yesterday. Mr Warner was described
by company insiders as one of the most vocal critics of Mr Robinson and
among those keen to see him leave American Express.
Mr John Byrne, chairman of Fund American Companies and another outside
director, is also leaving the board, although American Express claimed
yesterday that he first said he would not be seeking re-election last
November. Mr Byrne was among those board members who opposed Mr Robinson's
plan to name Mr Harvey Golub, his hand-picked aide, as chief executive.
The company said last night that both directors were leaving for 'personal
reasons'.
Many Wall Street analysts and investors have been angered by what the US
media are terming Mr Robinson's 'counter-coup'. Not only did Mr Robinson
survive as chairman; he was also named chairman and chief executive of
Shearson Lehman, the loss-making investment bank and brokerage subsidiary.
Since the announcement, a total of Dollars 1.3bn has been wiped off the
company's market capitalisation.
The resignations were announced after trading on Wall Street had closed.
Earlier in the day the company's share price was still falling in the wake
of the management upheaval and the disclosure of poor 1992 earnings.
At close of trading in New York last night the share price was Dollars 1
lower at Dollars 23 in unusually heavy trading volume of 4.6m shares. Since
the management shake-up was announced on Monday, the company's share price
has fallen by nearly 11 per cent.
