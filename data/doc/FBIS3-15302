  [Text] Russia has delivered no nuclear fuel for Ukrainian 
nuclear power stations since the time Ukraine, Russia and the 
U.S.A. signed an agreement in Moscow. First Deputy Chairman of 
the Ukrainian State Committee on Nuclear Power Nur Nigmatullin 
told Interfax-Ukraine that the document was supposed to be 
supplemented by inter-governmental agreements. "They have been 
drafted and are under discussion but the deliveries will not 
arrive until the agreements are signed," Nigmatullin explained. 
  The fuel will be supplied at a price of $600,000 to $700,000 
per fuel element for VVER-1000 reactors as compensation for 
warheads that will be sent to Russia for destruction. The 
Ukrainian nuclear power stations need 550 elements a year. 
  Nigmatullin said that the fuel supplied as compensation will 
last three to four years. "At the moment the Ukrainian nuclear 
power stations have a supply of fuel until May of June 1994," he 
added.
