  [Text] Beijing, March 8 (AFP) -- Chinese dissident leader 
Wang Dan was pulled in for questioning by public security 
officials Tuesday evening, friends of the 1989 student 
pro-democracy leader said. Wang, who had been held for 24 hours 
last week during a police sweep of prominent dissidents in the 
capital, was picked up again at 7:00 p.m. (1100 GMT), the 
friends said by telephone, adding that he was released after 
several hours of interrogation. 
  Wang said last Wednesday that the authorities had told him 
to 
leave Beijing ahead of the annual session of the Chinese 
parliament which opens Thursday.
