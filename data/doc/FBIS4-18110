  [Excerpt] Bonn -- With weapons deliveries, Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl is supporting the terrorism of the Turkish Army 
against the Kurds. This accusation was leveled by Tilman 
Zuelch, president of the Association for Threatened Peoples. 
Between 1985 and 1991 alone, military equipment worth 3.6 
billion German marks was exported to Turkey. 
  Together with Kurds, the Association for Threatened Peoples 
continued the vigil in front of the Defense Ministry in Bonn 
yesterday. They wanted to protest against Bonn's hostile 
foreign policy vis-a-vis the Kurds, a statement read. 
  Zuelch accused the Bonn government of having given away free 
a large quantity of military equipment of the former People's 
Army to Turkey. It included 300 armored personnel carriers and 
350 armored vehicles, 100,000 bazookas, 250,000 submachine guns, 
and 500,000 rounds of ammunition. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
confirmed on Monday [28 March] that the Federal Government has 
been assured that German weapons are not being used in 
Kurdistan. The Turkish Government is doing "everything possible 
to keep this promise," Kinkel stressed. [passage omitted]
