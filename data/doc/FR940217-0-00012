Note 1: 

Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this AD merely restate the requirements of paragraphs A. and B. of AD 890212,

(b) Within 10 hours of airplane operation after April 3, 1989 (the effective date of AD 890212, Amendment
396155), modify the wiring to the 

#

#

2 electronic display controllers, in accordance with Gulfstream Aircraft Service Change No. 110, dated January
24, 1989. 


(c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Small Airplane Directorate.
Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments
and then send it to the Manager, Atlanta ACO. 



Note 2: 

Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Atlanta ACO. 

(d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location
where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. 

(e) Accomplishment of the actions specified in both paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this AD constitutes terminating
action for the requirements of this AD: 

(1) Modify the Bendix ILS systems in accordance with Gulfstream Aircraft Service Change No. 110A, dated April 9, 1993;
and 

(2) Prior to further flight after accomplishing the actions specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this AD, reactivate

with a method approved by the Manager, Atlanta ACO, FAA, Small Airplane Directorate. 

(f) The modifications shall be done in accordance with Gulfstream Aircraft Service Change No. 110, dated January
