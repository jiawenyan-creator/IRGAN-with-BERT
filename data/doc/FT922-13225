FT  13 APR 92 / Shell seeks to change decision-making policy
SHELL UK is to change its policy on decision-making after finding that
delegating decisions to individuals and small groups led to worsened
communications in the group, according to Personnel Management, the magazine
of the Institute of Personnel Management.
The UK arm of the oil multi-national found that communications suffered as
departments became cut off from each other and the centre of the
organisation, the magazine says.
Shell said it would retain its basic structure, but would seek to improve
communications between departments.
Speaking at a conference, Mr John Wybrew, Shell's public affairs and
planning director, said a conflict had emerged between professionals who
represented the 'Shell way' of doing things, and executives who wanted fast
decision-making.
He warned: 'In adopting fashionable personnel management ideas, for which
there are very good reasons, you have to be careful how you integrate them
into the business.'
