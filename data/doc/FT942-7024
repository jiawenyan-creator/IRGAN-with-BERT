FT  27 MAY 94 / Whitehall agency to oversee offices
A new Whitehall agency is to be created to advise on the management of civil
service office accommodation and ensure that government bodies do not
inadvertently compete against each other for prime properties.
The agency will take over many of the responsibilities for co-ordinating
government office management from Property Holdings, the arm of the
environment department that manages the Common User Estate. The estate
provides 7.5m sq m of office space across Great Britain for government
departments, agencies and quangos.
The 3,267 offices in the estate are to be handed over to the bodies that
occupy them. They will take over responsibility for the rent, repairs and
maintenance - and for the cost of property they no longer need and which
cannot be re-let.
The demise of Property Holdings, which was created out of the Property
Services Agency in 1990, follows an investigation of the management of the
government's civil estate by the Cabinet Office efficiency unit.
This concluded that making departments directly responsible for their
offices would improve accountability and encourage them to make better use
of their accommodation.
The new agency will help smaller departments to manage their new
responsibilities and help to find new tenants for empty offices.
