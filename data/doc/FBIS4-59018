  [Text] Israel and Morocco are currently holding contacts 
in a bid to establish diplomatic ties. Prime Minister Rabin may 
travel to Morocco in the next two weeks. Our political 
correspondent Udi Segal has the details: 
  Over the last few days contacts have been held between 
Israeli and Moroccan officials in a bid to open an 
Israeli-Moroccan liaison office in Morocco as a first stage 
toward the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two 
countries. IDF Radio has learned that Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin may travel to Morocco in the next two weeks in an attempt 
to facilitate these contacts. A senior political source said, 
at the same time, that so far the attempt to open the liaison 
office has not succeeded. 
  Prime Minister Rabin landed in Morocco for the first time on 
his way back from the Declaration of Principles [DOP] signing 
ceremony in Washington last September. At that time Rabin met 
the king of Morocco, and since then there has been a lot of talk 
about the establishment of relations between the two countries. 
So far, however, the Moroccans have prevented this. Since the 
DOP signing ceremony there have been ongoing contacts between 
Israel and Morocco, especially in the economic-business sphere. 
There was also talk about the possibility of a direct air link 
between Morocco and Israel. It is possible that Prime Minister 
Rabin intends to inaugurate such a link in the next few weeks, 
when he flies from Israel to Moroccan capital Rabat.
