FT  21 FEB 92 / EC is key issue in Malta poll
MALTESE membership of the European Community will be the key issue when the
260,000 voters go to the polls tomorrow to elect a new parliament.
Mr Eddie Fenech Adami's ruling Nationalist Party, which filed Malta's
application for full membership in 1990, wants negotiations with Brussels to
get under way next year and entry to be sanctioned by 1995. Some 70 per cent
of Malta's trade is done with the EC.
The opposition Labour Party, led by Mr Carmelo Mifsud Bonnici, opposes full
membership in favour of strengthening Malta's existing association agreement
signed in 1970. This grants the island access to Community markets and funds
without limiting Maltese governments in fashioning their own economic and
trading policies.
The race between the two main parties could be close. To increase its meagre
4,000-vote lead over Labour and its single-seat parliamentary majority, Mr
Fenech Adami's Christian Democratic party is counting on the impact of its
liberal policies.
The lifting of import restrictions imposed by previous Socialist
administrations has resulted in shops bulging with imported goods. Each year
10,000 new cars are snapped up by the increasingly affluent Maltese. To keep
the economy buoyant the government has pumped money into infrastructure
projects, including a new airport terminal and a sorely needed new power
generating plant.
The Labour Party claims the government has mismanaged the nation's coffers
by doubling the national debt to Lm200m (Pounds 355m) in the past five
years. To woo voters it has dropped several controversial policies,
including its opposition to private hospitals and free trade, and has
improved relations with the powerful Roman Catholic church.
A new party, Democratic Alternative, which emphasises the environment among
its policies, is appealing to those disgruntled by the established parties
and hoping for a hung parliament. The result is expected early next week.
