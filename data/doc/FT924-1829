FT  16 DEC 92 / Watchdog protests at 'loss' of inheritance tax revenue
MILLIONS of pounds in possible receipts from inheritance tax are being
forgone annually because of inadequate procedures, the National Audit Office
said yesterday.
Action by the Revenue's share valuation division alone, which has closed
many inheritance and capital gains tax cases without a detailed examination
since 1989, might save up to Pounds 20m a year.
The NAO, the public-sector spending watchdog, said the Revenue should review
procedures introduced to reduce inheritance tax arrears. It should also
re-examine the existing system of reminders and penalties to handle cases
faster.
The NAO report says the Revenue's capital taxes offices are coping well with
a complicated tax system and that delays and backlogs are being reduced.
Total inheritance tax last year was Pounds 1.3bn, raised at a cost of Pounds
28m.
It highlights a number of issues deserving further attention, including
temporary measures introduced in the share valuation division that have not
been amended, although the volume of cases closed without detailed
evaluation has risen substantially since 1989.
Work-saving measures introduced in 1985 in the London capital taxes office
to concentrate on cases offering the best return may have jeopardised tax
amounting to several million pounds. The office has fallen behind with work
because of rapid staff turnover. In April this year, the London office had
21,100 open cases, of which 21 per cent had been pending for three years or
more. The number of cases involving difficulty in recovering unpaid
inheritance tax rose from 1,494 in 1986 to 2,274 last year.
The NAO says the Revenue should consider better monitoring of compliance
with exemption procedures.
