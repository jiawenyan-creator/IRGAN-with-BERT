<F P=106> [Interview with Yves Gagnon, Canadian Foreign Ministry </F>
spokesman; place and date not given: "We Did Not Send Al-Turabi 
an Invitation To Visit Our Country"--first paragraph is 
AL-MAJALLAH introduction] 
  [Text] AL-MAJALLAH interviewed Yves Gagnon, a spokesman for 
the Canadian Foreign Ministry, about the circumstances of 
al-Turabi's visit to Canada and what took place during his 
meeting with officials at the Foreign Ministry. He denied that 
Ottawa had sent an official invitation, but refused to talk 
about the passport on which al-Turabi had entered Canada. Here 
is the text of the interview. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] On what basis did you receive al-Turabi at the 
Foreign Ministry? 
  [Gagnon] Al-Turabi met with officials at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs on 25 May 1992. We received him as an 
influential personality. During the meeting, we asked him to 
work to persuade the Sudanese Government to change its policy 
regarding human rights and restoration of freedoms. We feel 
uneasy about the continued violations of human rights in Sudan, 
the continuing war in the south, and the condition of general 
freedoms. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] Did you send al-Turabi an invitation to visit 
Canada? 
  [Gagnon] The Canadian Government did not send an invitation 
to al-Turabi. He came on a private visit. He has contacts here 
and relations with figures who arranged his visit. He was 
originally on a European and American tour before coming here. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] Who requested the meeting: the Canadian 
Foreign 
Ministry or al-Turabi? 
  [Gagnon] We asked to meet him when he came here. We thought 
we would take advantage of the opportunity and hear what he had 
to say as an influential personality. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] What kind of visa was given to al-Turabi? Did 
he arrive in Canada using his real name or under an alias? 
  [Gagnon] Canadian laws on personal freedoms prevent us from 
revealing to a third party any information about al-Turabi's 
passport or the kind of entry visa that was granted to him. 
  [AL-MAJALLAH] Were the discussions at the Foreign Ministry 
meeting limited to political subjects, or did they involve trade 
issues? 
  [Gagnon] The meeting was political. We did not discuss any 
subjects at the meeting having to do with deals, commercial 
matters, or other things.
