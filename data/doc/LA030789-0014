WRITERS' VIEWS OF RUSHDIE BOOK 
In his column, Mailer took the opportunity of Rushdie's misfortune to harp on 
his own unfounded personal gripes. I take offense at his trumped-up statistics 
that claim that booksellers are not in danger as a result of making Rushdie's 
book available to the public, and his implications that even if they were, no 
one should mind, because the average bookseller (or is it one out of six?) 
doesn't know a book from a can of soup, or Saul Bellow from the average peon. 
Even if Mailer himself walked into my bookstore, slapped down his Visa and 
demanded Tom Wolfe's latest work, I would treat him just like everyone else. Of 
course, Mailer might not want to go shopping in South Coast Plaza. As I write 
this, the police have come to question our manager about her procedure in the 
case of a bomb threat. One of the other bookstores in this mall has received 
one, and we have to be ready for anything. 
Waldenbooks has never ceased to carry the book, but like any controversial 
material, it has been handled carefully. It has been and will always be for 
sale at our store. Even for Norman Mailer.
