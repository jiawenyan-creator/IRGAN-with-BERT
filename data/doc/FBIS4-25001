  [Text] Shanghai, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai has set a 
record in approving the establishment of foreign-funded projects 
this year. 
  A survey shows that the country's largest economic center 
approved 1,612 contractual projects from 43 countries and 
regions in the first five months of this year, up three percent 
over the same period of last year. These projects involve 3.85 
billion U.S. dollars worth of investment commitments, up 11 
percent. 
  The number of projects solely funded by foreign investors 
during this period is double the figure of last year, according 
to the survey. 
  The city's industrial sector still takes the lead in 
attracting foreign investment, followed by real estate and 
public utilities. 
  The survey said that Hong Kong is the number one investor in 
this leading industrial center, with the United States second 
and Japan third. 
  By the end of may this year, the number of foreign-funded 
projects in the city had climbed to 8,551 from 50 countries and 
regions with combined investment commitments worth 17.55 billion 
U.S. dollars.
