  [Text] Warsaw, 2 May--The national strike committee of the 
Independent Self-Governing Trade Union [NSZZ] Solidarity of 
Public Sector Employees decided today to declare a strike alert. 
It will not take an immediate active form, and there will be a 
24-hour notice on the commencement of industrial action, Ewa 
Tomaszewska, chairwoman of the strike committee said at a news 
conference in Warsaw. 
  She also said that the committee's decision on further 
measures will depend on whether or not the demands of the 
public-sector employees are included in the schedule of work on 
matters awaiting solutions, which had been submitted by 
Solidarity. The schedule is to be prepared by the Tripartite 
Commission for Socioeconomic Affairs. The commission is due to 
meet in Warsaw on 4 May.
