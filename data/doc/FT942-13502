FT  25 APR 94 / Team briefings' popularity revealed
Employers are spending Pounds 290 a person a year on communicating with
staff, the Industrial Society says in a report today, Richard Donkin writes.
The noticeboard remains the most popular channel of communication, but many
are adopting sophisticated techniques such as electronic mail and
television.
The report says employers seeking ways to communicate with their workforces
consider regular team briefings the best way of achieving feedback from
employees.
More than half the 915 managers questioned said team briefings were the best
method, followed by large staff meetings where managers visit different
branches.
The report coincides with the society's launch of the Employee
Communications Association to promote professional links and qualifications
for staff responsible for internal communications.
Ms Jenny Davenport, the society's communications specialist, said the report
reflected a trend among organisations to try to listen more to employees.
The trend was driven, she said, by quality and customer care programmes and
a growing awareness of untapped potential in the workforce.
Other methods used by employers to communicate with staff include suggestion
schemes, meetings with unions and staff surveys.
