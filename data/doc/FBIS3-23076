<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Concha Flores at Alicante airport] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Air Algerie Boeing 727 
landed at l'Altet airport at 1345 [1245 GMT]. It was on an 
internal flight between Oran and Annaba when it was hijacked and 
diverted to l'Altet airport, where it is still being held on the 
runway. The airport has been cordoned off by the police and the 
operation is being headed by Alfonso Calve, civil governor of 
Alicante, who has gone to where the plane is to make contact 
with the three hijackers, who are apparently asking for 
political asylum.
