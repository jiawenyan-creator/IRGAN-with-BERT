  [Text] Cairo--It has become certain that the PLO Political 
Department will be moved from Tunis to Cairo within the next 
weeks. 
  AKHBAR AL-USBU' learned that final preparations have been 
completed to move the Political Department. Informed sources 
expect that this will be the beginning of moving all PLO 
departments from Tunis to Cairo in the coming months. 
  Meanwhile, the Tunisian Government has decided not to renew 
the residency of any Palestinian in Tunisia as of late last 
month. The government gave instructions to the concerned 
authorities to deport any Palestinian as soon as his residency 
expires. Scores of Palestinians, whose residency permits 
expired, have been deported, and all Palestinians are expected 
to be deported from Tunisia by the end of this year.
