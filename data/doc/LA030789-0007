MAN CHARGED IN 12 RAPES RECONSIDERS GUILTY PLEA 
In a surprise move, sentencing for the man known as the "bolder-than-most" 
rapist was continued on Monday after the defendant told a Superior Court judge 
that he was rethinking his decision last month to plead guilty to a series of 
sexual assaults that terrorized women throughout the San Diego area. 
Alvin Quarles, 26, of Paradise Hills had agreed to a plea bargain in which he 
admitted guilt to 12 felony charges in return for a prison sentence of 50 
years. 
But, on Monday, when he was scheduled to be sentenced, his attorney, Charles 
Adair, announced that Quarles wanted more time to consider the guilty plea 
because he felt 50 years was too long a sentence. Adair said Quarles would have 
to serve about half of the 50 years before he would even be eligible for 
parole. 
But the alternative, a jury trial, could lead to a maximum sentence of more 
than 200 years in prison, and Quarles might be required to serve up to 60 years 
of that sentence before being eligible for parole, Adair said. 
"He would have ended up doing 50 to 60 years or dying in prison," the attorney 
said. "Unless he got a pardon. You'd have to ask the governor about that, and, 
when it comes to sex cases, I'm not aware of any sympathetic ear in the 
governor's office." 
Judge Jesus Rodriguez set a new court date of March 20, at which time Quarles 
is to either formally ask to withdraw his guilty plea and seek a jury trial or 
proceed with the 50-year sentencing. 
Adair said Quarles was at one time charged with 61 counts in attacks that 
occurred in National City, Clairemont, Mission Valley and East San Diego, 
dating back to September, 1987. He was dubbed the "bolder-than-most" rapist by 
police for his tendency to sexually attack women even if others, such as 
roommates or spouses, were present.
