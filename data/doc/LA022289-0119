COMPROMISE ORDERED 
A federal judge Tuesday ordered attorneys for the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service and advocates for farm-worker amnesty applicants to work 
out a compromise on a lawsuit filed against Border Patrol agents who have 
illegally seized documents from dozens of migrant workers. U.S. District Judge 
J. Lawrence Irving ordered INS attorney Charles Hamilton and Stephen Rosenbaum, 
a lawyer with the California Rural Legal Assistance, to reach a compromise by 
April 24. CRLA lawyers teamed up with the American Civil Liberties Union to sue 
the INS in December to stop the border agents from seizing the documents.
