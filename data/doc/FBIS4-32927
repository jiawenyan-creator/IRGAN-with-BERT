  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota 29 May (AFP) -- According to exit 
polls conducted by the Caracol Radio Network with 57,800 voters 
after they had cast their votes, liberal candidate Ernesto 
Samper will win this Sunday's election. Samper will receive 
47.3 percent and his opponent, conservative Andres Pastrana, 
44.3 percent of the vote. 
  Those polled were also asked about their favorite candidate 
for an eventual run-off election, which would be held on 19 
June. While Samper is also seen to lead this election with 50.4 
percent of the intended votes, 47.5 percent favor Pastrana and 
2.1 percent are undecided. 
  Caracol was unable to report the results of this poll 
because 
of the Colombian Government's restrictions on releasing 
election-related information.
