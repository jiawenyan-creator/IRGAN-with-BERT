FT  23 MAY 94 / International Company News: Shell Canada sells mothballed
refinery
Shell Canada, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch Shell group, has sold a
mothballed refinery near Calgary to Aban Loyd Chiles Offshore, an oil
products company based in Madras, India, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
The refinery, which has a capacity of 30,000 barrels of oil a day, will be
dismantled and shipped to India over the next two years. Terms of the sale
have not been disclosed.
The refinery, which is near the town of Balzac, Alberta, was built in 1982,
but has been idle for the past two years. It was acquired by Shell last year
as part of its purchase of a western Canadian oil production and
distribution com-pany.
Shell Canada shipped a similar refinery to China in 1987.
