FT  08 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: UK housing
The UK's withdrawal from the ERM meant it was only a matter of time before a
housing recovery began. Sure enough, along it comes. This week the Halifax
building society reported a 1.6 per cent rise in house prices in April
bringing the total to 2.5 per cent this year. Mortgage lending by the
clearing banks rose 14 per cent in the first quarter. The media excites
itself over forecasts of a 10 per cent rise in Greater London house prices
next year. Soon the assets of the 1.9m house buyers with negative equity may
be worth what was paid for them.
It would, though, be wrong to over-egg the excitement. Recovery is likely to
prove muted and slow. Prices still have to rise a long way to recapture
historic highs. First-time buyers may be abundant but there is markedly less
activity higher up the chain with owners snared in the negative equity trap.
Stricter credit terms to meet revised mortgage indemnity rules and weak
building society margins will also limit credit expansion. There are still
some 150,000 unsold empty properties to dampen prices.
What the housing flurry means for the economy at large is a moot point.
Higher turnover may have sparked retail sales. But if the recession really
has convinced buyers that houses are abodes not investment vehicles cautious
individuals may continue to channel marginal income into savings not
consumption. The higher proportion of new borrowers holding fixed rate
mortgages may also have broader implications. The interest rate weapon will
be a less effective way for the government to curb consumer demand in
future.
