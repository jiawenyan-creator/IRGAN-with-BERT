FT  13 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses see big moves in
second-line stocks
RUMOURS of a new coup in Russia were denied early in the day, but they
affected most bourses, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT fell to a day's low of 1,671.63 on the DAX index at one point, but
closed only 4.63 lower at 1,678.92. The FAZ index also fell 4.63 to 684.09
at midsession.
There was movement, but little conviction in the big blue chips as turnover
rose from DM5.4bn to DM5.8bn. Chemicals fell back, Hoechst losing the most
with a DM2.80 decline to DM251.
Carmakers varied, Daimler and Volkswagen falling DM4.80 to DM734, and DM3.50
to DM337.50 respectively but BMW rising DM5 to DM546.50.
The big price changes came in smaller companies with Puma, the sports goods
producer controlled by Aritmos of Sweden, up DM45, or 22 per cent to DM250
while Ava, the retailer, put on DM95, or 15 per cent to DM740.
Puma's rise followed a statement that it had returned to profit in 1991
after several difficult years. Ava racked up a market turnover of DM299m,
placing it sixth in the German top 10. It rose on rumours that Asko, which
said a week ago that it owned more than 50 per cent of Ava, was buying up
Ava stock on the open market. Asko denied this later.
PARIS remained locked in a narrow trading range and the big moves were seen
in less liquid stocks. The CAC-40 index ended down 2.46 to 1,861.60 in light
turnover of FFr1.4bn.
Perrier continued to rise as institutions sought to build up small but
crucial stakes in the hope of selling out to the highest bidder in the event
of a takeover battle. The stock added FFr18 to FFr1,548 with 77,025 shares
traded.
However there were reports that the Cob had decided that Perrier did not
have the right to sell its treasury stock to St Louis. If this were the
case, analysts said it was likely that a Paris court, due to meet on
February 25, would annul the sale of the 13.8 per cent stake in Perrier,
thus facilitating Nestle's bid and offering the Agnelli camp a graceful
exit.
Among second-liners, Chargeurs rose FFr56 or 5.1 per cent to FFr1,150 with
42,250 shares traded on news that the UK satellite television venture BSkyB,
in which Chargeurs has a 15.9 per cent stake, could soon be profitable.
Chargeurs also said that it had entered a cooperation agreement with an
Italian textiles group.
The builder Spie Batignolles jumped FFr19.50 or 6.1 per cent to FFr337.50
with 25,675 shares traded on talk that Schneider might sell off part of its
stake in Spie in the wake of the latter's poor results.
MILAN closed lower as traders squared their positions ahead of the close of
the monthly trading account on Friday. Dealers estimated that 60 per cent of
the monthly options contracts had been abandoned. The Comit index fell 2.88
to 538.33 in turnover estimated at around Tuesday's L87.7bn.
Among industrials, Fiat fell L38 to L4,937 while Pirelli eased L9 to L1,122
as its plants were halted by a four-hour strike.
Dealers reported some buying interest in Generali from domestic mutual
funds, which pushed the stock up by L80 to L30,880 at the official close.
But the stock eased after hours.
AMSTERDAM was steady, as the CBS Tendency index closed unchanged at 121.9.
Heineken lost Fl 2.60 to Fl 170.00 mainly due to profit - taking. Trading
group Borsumij continued its strong advance, gaining Fl 2.00 to Fl 64.70
after it announced good 1992 profit prospects earlier in the week.
MADRID saw strong volume in the electrical and construction sectors. The
general index finished 0.47 up at 259.51. January CPI figures are released
today and most observers have forecast a rise of 1.5 per cent, lower than
previous predictions, which should give a stimulus to the market. Hopes of a
cut in interest rates also lifted prices.
ZURICH saw Swiss interest rates steady to marginally higher and the SPI
index fell 1.5 to 1,125.5. Banks, traditionally sensitive to interest rate
changes, closed lower. UBS bearers fell SFr40 to SFr3,810 and CS Holding by
SFr20 to SFr2,000.
STOCKHOLM had another look at Tuesday's Ericsson results, concentrated on
the gloomy outlook for 1992 and put the B shares down SKr3 to SKr114 in
turnover of SKr62m. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 3.8 to 953.6 in
turnover down from SKr405m to SKr324m.
HELSINKI hit a second consecutive 1992 high with the Hex index 1.7 higher at
896.7, as did VIENNA, the 18-share ATX index rising 2.04 to 1,033.21.
ISTANBUL corrected falls of the last two days, the 75-share index closing up
83.66, or 2 per cent, to 4,266.62.
