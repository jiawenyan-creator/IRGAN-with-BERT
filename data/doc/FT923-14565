FT  07 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Bolivia puts Andean pact in doubt
THE future of the Andean Pact - grouping Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador,
Bolivia and Peru - appears uncertain following the Bolivian government's
overtures to a southern cone common market, Sarita Kendall reports from
Quito.
The government of President Jaime Paz Zamora said Bolivia, which has lower
tariffs than the other Andean countries, 'may well' seek full membership of
Mercosur, the proposed customs union of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay. Such a move, reflecting Bolivia's growing links with Mercosur
countries, would require it to withdraw from the Andean Pact.
Venezuela's decision to break diplomatic relations with Peru, because of
April's suspension of the constitution, has also halted negotiations over
tariffs and compounded failures to define a common external tariff.
