FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Standard Platforms in reconstruction plan
Shares in Standard Platforms Holdings, the USM-quoted computer hardware and
software group, which were suspended on March 30 at 36p pending publication
of its accounts, resumed trading at 18p yesterday.
The group reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.07m for the 18 months to
September 30 1993, against losses of Pounds 847,471 for the previous year.
It also announced a proposed rights issue, loan stock conversion, a capital
reduction, a share option scheme and board changes. The directors said that
if resolutions relating to these were not passed at an extraordinary meeting
on June 9 the group's future would be uncertain and it might have to cease
trading.
The capital reconstruction involves the subdivision of 10p ordinary shares
into one ordinary 1p share and one deferred 9p share.
The issue, to raise Pounds 450,000 net, is on the basis of 5-for-2 at 5p per
share fully underwritten by a group of investors brought together by IDJ.
