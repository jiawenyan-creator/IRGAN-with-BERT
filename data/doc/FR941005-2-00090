SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The ROD documents the decision of the Service to establish the Patoka River National Wetlands Project in Pike and Gibson
Counties, Indiana. The Service selected Alternative 4, described as the preferred alternative in the Final Environmental
Impact Statement, as the best alternative for implementing the Project. This action includes the acquisition from
willing sellers of 6,800 acres for the Patoka River National Wildlife Refuge and acquisition of Wildlife Management
Areas from within an adjacent 15,283-acre selection area. The ROD identifies the alternatives considered, the issues
and concerns raised during the 8-year planning process, the rationale for choosing the selected alternative, and
the impacts of this selection.


The Project encompasses one of the last remaining stretches of bottomland forest in Indiana and the Midwest. It provides
some of the best wood duck production habitat in the State and is used by threatened and endangered species including
bald eagles, Indiana bats, and the proposed northern copperbelly watersnake. Project lands will be managed to protect
and enhance bottomland hardwood forests, other wetland habitats, and complementary uplands. The goal is to provide
essential food, cover and resting areas for migratory birds, threatened and endangered species, and resident fish
and wildlife; and to improve outdoor recreation and education opportunities for the American people. Copies of the
ROD have been sent to all landowners within the proposed Project boundaries; to Federal, state and local government
officials; interested parties; and all individuals, agencies and organizations who requested copies.
