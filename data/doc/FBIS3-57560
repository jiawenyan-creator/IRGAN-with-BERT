  [Text] Nazran -- Speaking on local TV, Murat Keligov, 
adviser to the Ingushetia president, stated that the republic's 
future constitution "must record an unequivocal provision" that 
it is part of the Russian Federation. The future fundamental 
law should reflect Ingushetia's sovereignty and its struggle, 
"exclusively by political means," to ensure the return of the 
territory of Prigorodnyy Rayon, which now belongs to North 
Ossetia.
