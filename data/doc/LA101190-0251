THE SIDELINES; 
GERRING, RARICK LEAD 1ST ROUND 
Cathy Gerring and Cindy Rarick shot 3-under-par 69s today to share the

One stroke back in the 16-player invitational event was another American,

Daniel, was tied at 71 with European Tour star Marie-Laure de Lorenzi of 
France. 
Gerring had seven birdies over the 6,155-yard Cely course, one bogey, and a 
triple bogey.
