FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: FFr4.1bn rights issue at Paribas
Paribas, the French banking group, plans to raise FFr4.1bn (Dollars 695m)
through a one-for-nine rights issue at FFr400 a share, Reuter reports from
Paris.
The group is to pay an unchanged net dividend of FFr12 per share for 1993
and will grant one bonus share for every 10 shares held. New shares acquired
in its rights issue will qualify for the bonus share, Paribas said.
Last month, Paribas said estimated net profits for 1993 had increased by 58
per cent to FFr1.4bn.
Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman, said the group had benefited from a very good
performance in market trading, where it made strong gains during this
summer's European currency crisis. It fared well in its North American and
Asian banking activities.
He forecast a further profit increase for this year saying Paribas should
continue the improvement during 1994.
Paribas estimated total operating income at FFr33.3bn, against FFr29bn in
1992 with gross operating income rising to FFr13.5bn from FFr11.3bn.
However, it was forced to make FFr9.2bn of new net provisions - against
FFr7.7bn in 1992 - partly due to the problems of the French property market.
