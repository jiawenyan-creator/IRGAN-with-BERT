THE WORLD 
Belgium lodged a strong protest with Romania after a Belgian political leader 
said he and a colleague were beaten by Romanian police when they tried to visit 
dissident writer Doina Cornea last week. Gerard Deprez, chairman of the Social 
Christian Party, said he and Christian Leonard, the party's former press 
attache, were punched by police when they approached Cornea's home in the 
Romanian town of Cluj. Leonard, who suffered a black eye, was almost run over 
when a police officer tripped him and pushed him toward a passing car as the 
two men tried to flee, Deprez told reporters in Brussels.
