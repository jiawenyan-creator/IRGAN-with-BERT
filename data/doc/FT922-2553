FT  16 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Managers take a passage
from India - In a nutshell
Thirty owner-managers of small but growing businesses from the Karnataka
region of India are taking part in a three-month programme in the UK to help
them manage the growth of their companies.
A second programme involving owner-managers from the Ahmedabad region will
start in September. If these two pilots are successful, the scheme will be
launched nationally throughout India in 1993.
The development programme is being run by the Small Business Centre at
Durham University Business School (DUBS), together with the Entrepreneurship
Development Institute of India.
