FT  17 SEP 92 / World News in Brief: Hitler burial mystery
Archive film, broadcast by Commonwealth television and believed to be from
KGB secret police files now being declassified, showed a corpse said to be
that of Adolf Hitler, intact and lying in the yard of the Berlin
Chancellery. If authentic, the film throws doubt on reports following the
second world war that Hitler's body was destroyed by German officers after
he committed suicide.
