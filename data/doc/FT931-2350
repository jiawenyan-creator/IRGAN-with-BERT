FT  20 MAR 93 / Letter: BT reckons rates are low
Sir, National Utility Services' simplistic method of comparing local
telephone call prices means that like is not compared with like ('BT rates
for local calls 'high' ', March 17).
For a start, the NUS survey excludes cheap-rate local calls which are of
most benefit to our residential customers and where BT's charges are among
the lowest in the world. The survey also selects a call of three minutes.
Like BT, many countries charge in fixed meter steps. Particularly for local
calls, the size of the step varies greatly between countries, so choice of
call duration can give different results.
More important, the survey ignores the size of the local call area. BT's
local call areas are among the largest in the world, including, for
instance, the whole of London. Many of the calls that BT's customers make at
local call rates would be priced at higher long distance rates in other
countries.
You also say that BT's line rental is high at Pounds 10.28 a month. We do
not know how NUS derived this figure. The quarterly line rental for BT's 19m
residential customers is Pounds 19.54 and for its 7m business customers
Pounds 31.65, equivalent to a monthly rate of Pounds 6.52 and Pounds 10.55
respectively.
