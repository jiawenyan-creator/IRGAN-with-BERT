SOMALIA ARRESTS CRITICS OF PRESIDENT 
Police have detained prominent critics of Somali President Mohammed Siad Barre 
after they published a manifesto calling for a caretaker government to restore 
human rights and order. 
The Interior Ministry said in a statement that those arrested were detained for 
inciting people to acts of violence against the government. The statement did 
not name anyone but witnesses said those arrested included Somalia's first 
president, Aden Abdulle Osman.
