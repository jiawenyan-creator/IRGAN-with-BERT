  [Text] Beijing, March 17 (AFP) -- Most of the 106 Tibetan 
prisoners featured on a list recently submitted to China by the 
United States have already been freed, Raidi, president of the 
Tibetan people's assembly said Thursday. "I am not sure of the 
exact number, but there are no more than eight or 10 still in 
jail," Raidi told journalists after a press conference called by 
the Tibetan delegation to the annual session of parliament in 
Beijing. 
  During his recent visit to China, U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher asked the Chinese Government to provide 
information on 106 people believed to be jailed in Tibet because 
of their religious or political convictions. During the press 
conference Raidi, who is also deputy secretary of the Tibetan 
Communist Party, said Tibetan authorities had "already received 
several similar lists", adding that "certain people" on them 
"did not even exist". "I do not know how they (Western and 
international organisatons) compiled these lists," he said. 
  The Tibetan delegation told reporters here that human rights 
were respected on the "Roof of the World" and that attempts at 
separatism were doomed to failure.
