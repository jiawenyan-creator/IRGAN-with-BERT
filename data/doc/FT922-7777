FT  16 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 1m reorganisation costs force Holmes
&amp; Marchant into red
WITH ITS clients' marketing budgets being cut across the board, Holmes &amp;
Marchant, the marketing services group, tumbled into the red in the six
months to March 31.
Pre-tax losses amounted to Pounds 748,000 (profits Pounds 1.7m) and were
struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 1.05m (Pounds 122,000) and interest
payable reduced to Pounds 501,000 (Pounds 839,000) by the 1-for-3 cash call
last May.
But Mr Emyr Jones, finance director, said with reorganisation costs paid in
the period and with turnover and profits at similar levels, he expected
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 800,000 in the second half, giving a
break-even position for the year.
The rights issue cut debt from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 8.1m at the September
year-end, but reorganisation costs have since bumped it up to Pounds 8.7m.
Mr Jones said the group had banking facilities for Pounds 10.8m, giving it
'enough headroom'. As late as February 25, the payment of the proposed 3.3p
final dividend for 1990-91 was cancelled, saving Pounds 800,000. The current
interim is passed (3.3p).
The exceptional charges related to redundancies and the costs of empty
properties. Mr Jones said the current reorganisation, which was expected to
save Pounds 1m in the full year and in which 31 jobs were lost, was largely
complete. Deferred considerations on acquisitions made in the 1980s - the
bane of sector - were also largely over, he added, with less than Pounds
300,000 due in the second half and less than Pounds 250,000 due next year.
The company has Pounds 5m-worth of freehold property.
Turnover fell to Pounds 17.5m (Pounds 25.2m), though Mr Jones ascribed the
decline largely to Broadbent Advertising, the regional retail advertising
agency, which lost a number of clients when contracts were renegotiated. All
the other companies were net gainers of clients, he said.
Losses per share were 2p (earnings 6.6p).
