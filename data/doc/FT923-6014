FT  27 AUG 92 / Scientists warn on painful vehicles: British Association for
the Advancement of Science
CARS VARY greatly in how comfortable they are to drive and the amount of
back pain they cause, the Vehicle Ergonomics Group at Loughborough
University said, Clive Cookson writes.
The unit, which has evaluated 100 different cars since 1980, found that one
popular medium-sized car caused almost twice as much lower-back pain as two
of its rivals.
'It would seem that this car should carry a health warning,' said Dr Mark
Porter of the unit, although he refused to identify it.
Dr Porter said a study of high-mileage drivers of the four most popular
fleet cars in the UK showed that more than half were suffering lower-back
pain. Research carried out in the US found that men who spent at least half
of their working lives driving were three times more likely than low-mileage
drivers to develop a slipped disc.
