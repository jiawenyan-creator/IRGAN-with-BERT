  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Serb forces would agree to 
the reopening of the airport at Tuzla in northeast Bosnia 
provided they can control all the traffic going through, a 
Yugoslav military official was quoted as saying Thursday [3 
February]. Armed Forces spokesman Colonel Ljubodrag 
Stojadinovic was quoted by the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA. 
The United Nations is considering authorising air strikes 
against besieging Serb forces to obtain the reopening of Tuzla, 
which is considered an essential channel for humanitarian aid.
