INTRUDER DAMAGES HEATH'S LAWN 
Authorities today sought an intruder who used weed killer to write the words 
"We were here" on the lawn of former Prime Minister Edward Heath's home, police 
said. 
The intruder slipped past a police guard at the front gate of Heath's 
14th-Century mansion on property adjoining Salisbury Cathedral, 65 miles 
southwest of London, police said. A police spokesman said the incident occurred 
last week while the former Conservative Party leader was away. "The house was 
not entered and nothing was stolen," he said. 
Heath was prime minister from 1970 to '74 and Conservative leader until 1975 
when he was succeeded by Margaret Thatcher.
