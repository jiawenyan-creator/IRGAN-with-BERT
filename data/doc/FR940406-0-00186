 

NHTSA has traditionally set light truck standards at a level that can be achieved by manufacturers whose vehicles
constitute a substantial share of the market. The agency did set the MY 1982 light truck fuel economy standards at a
level which it recognized might be above the maximum feasible fuel economy capability of Chrysler, based on the conclusion
that the energy benefits associated with the higher standard would outweigh the harm to Chrysler. 45 FR 20871, 20876,
March 31, 1980. However, as the agency noted in deciding not to set the MYs 198385 light truck standards above
Ford's level of capability, Chrysler had only 1015 percent of the light truck domestic sales, while Ford had
about 35 percent. 45 FR 81593, 81599, December 11, 1980.

The energy savings that could result from the MYs 199697 standard can be illustrated by considering the potential
effects of a standard set at different levels. Since Ford and Chrysler project CAFE levels for both MY 1996 and 1997
above 20.7 mpg, a standard set at 20.7 mpg would not likely have any effect on those companies. Since GM currently projects
a CAFE level of 20.5 mpg for both model years, a standard set at 20.7 mpg, the level NHTSA has determined to be GM's capability,
would encourage it to achieve a higher CAFE level. If a 20.7 mpg standard resulted in GM achieving a CAFE level 0.2 mpg
above its current projection, there would be a savings of 102 million gallons of gasoline over the lifetime of GM's
fleet for each model year. (This assumes GM would sell the same number of light trucks in MY 1996 and MY 1997 as it did in
MY 1993.) 
The potential savings associated with a MY 199697 standard above 20.7 mpg are highly uncertain. Assume, for
example, that a standard could be set at 21.2 mpg, 0.5 mpg above GM's capability for both model years and 0.4 mpg above
Chrysler's capability for MY 1996 and 0.2 mpg above its capability for MY 1997. Since Ford projects CAFE levels of 21.1
mpg and 21.6 mpg for MY 199697, such standards would likely have little or no impact on that company. GM and Chrysler
could likely meet the levels of the standards only by restricting the sales of their large light trucks. If this occurred,
consumers might tend to keep their older, less-fuel efficient light trucks in service longer. Also, consumers might
purchase still larger trucks that are not subject to CAFE standards. Therefore, the agency believes that any additional
energy savings associated with alternative higher fuel economy standards above 20.7 mpg (the level the agency has
determined to be GM's capability) would be uncertain and speculative.
