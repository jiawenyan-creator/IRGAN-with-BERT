  [Text] Through Decree 1817, issued on 31 December 1993, the 
Executive Branch finally confirmed the retirement of Colonel 
Luis Catalino Gonzalez Rojas from the Armed Forces active 
service. His retirement had been agreed upon during a meeting 
of the Armed Forces' Promotions Board last 22 November. Another 
50 colonels were also retired. 
  Col. Gonzalez Rojas was the first officer to charge Armed 
Forces officers with corrupt practices when he revealed the 
trafficking of stolen cars, which were taken to Bolivia through 
the Chaco region.
