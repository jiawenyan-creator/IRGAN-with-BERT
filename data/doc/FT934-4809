FT  02 DEC 93 / After the Budget: Markets bullish on interest rate cuts
The financial markets went into the Budget with a half-point cut in base
rates under their belts and strong expectations of another reduction - to 5
per cent - by early 1994.
The Budget further encouraged those expectations. The markets moved
vigorously in expectation of more monetary easing over the next few months,
despite cautious comments from the chancellor.
Long-dated government bonds rose by more than a point, continuing their
post-Budget rally. Yields at the long end have dropped 20 basis points since
Monday, reflecting City belief that long-term borrowing costs will continue
to fall.
But Mr Clarke was eager to give the impression that lending rates would not
come down rapidly. In a post-Budget briefing, he emphasised that any
decision to cut rates had to be based on a range of monetary indicators and
the medium-term inflation outlook.
'I was very glad to reduce interest rates last week but I won't do it again
unless and until I am satisfied the conditions exist,' he said.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, was similarly
cautious, dismissing the idea that public spending was a significant 'engine
of growth' and stressing that conditions were in place for 'sustained,
prolonged and rather unspectacular growth'.
However, the markets' behaviour expresses their conviction that the budget -
in taking an axe to the public sector borrowing requirement - opened the way
for sustainable, lower interest rates.
The Treasury forecast an underlying rate of 3.25 per cent for the retail
prices index excluding mortgage interest payments in the fourth quarter of
next year, a downward revision of its March forecast.
Even so, decisions about cuts in interest rates - based as they are on a
continuing assessment of monetary conditions - may be slower in coming than
the markets expect.
