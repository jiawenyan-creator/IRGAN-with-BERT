  [Text] Simferopol 7 June TASS -- A final document of the 
Ukrainian parliamentary delegation and the Crimean parliamentary 
working group adopted on 2-3 June in Simferopol has been 
described as a concession to the Ukrainian leadership by some 
Crimean deputies today. They demanded explanations who gave the 
working group the authority to sign the document. 
  Crimean Parliament Speaker Sergey Tsekov said the parliament 
had just forgotten to establish powers of the group at the 
negotiations, and objected to criticism. 
  In his turn, head of the working group Sergey Nikulin called 
the deputies' attention to the fact that every word of the 
document was well-considered and it carries no "wordings that 
impose obligations on any side." 
  The final document was taken into account, and the 
parliament 
decided to set up a new working group to continue the 
negotiations. This time the group's powers will be specified by 
the next parliament plenary scheduled for 14 June.
