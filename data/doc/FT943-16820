FT  02 JUL 94 / Brooke's proposals for BBC expected
The long-delayed white paper on the future of the BBC is expected to be
published next week, probably on Thursday, as the National Heritage
Department mounts what appears to be an enormous effort to clear the decks
before next month's summer recess, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The BBC white paper is likely to be followed by the equally long-awaited
decision on the future of Channel 5, and possibly by the even more delayed
white paper on the press and privacy, although this is viewed more as a hope
than an expectation.
The attempt to get three important pieces of work out of the department in
the next three weeks is being seen as a further indication that Mr Peter
Brooke, national heritage secretary, is likely to go in the summer
ministerial reshuffle.
Few surprises are expected in the BBC proposals, with the corporation
probably surviving intact as an institution funded by a universal licence
fee. The only uncertainty is over ownership of the BBC transmitter system
but the introduction of an element of private investment is more likely than
outright privatisation.
The Independent Television Commission has been waiting since February to
hear whether the frequencies will be available for Channel 5.
