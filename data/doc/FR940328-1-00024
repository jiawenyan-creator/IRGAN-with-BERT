<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing amendments
to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to clarify that the Government's obligation to purchase from statutorily
mandated sources of supply also applies when contractors purchase the supply items for Government use. This regulatory
action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September
30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Comments should be submitted on or before May 27, 1994, to be considered in the formulation of a final rule.



</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS),
18th  F Streets, NW., room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 91108 in all correspondence
related to this case.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



A. Background



The proposed amendments to FAR Parts 8, 51, and 62 provide clarification that the statutory obligation for Government
agencies to satisfy their requirements for certain supplies from procurement lists of supplies available from the
Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (Committee) also applies when contractors
purchase the supply items for Government use. The proposed revisions respond to concerns raised by the Committee
that such a clarification is necessary for situations when Government agencies contract with commercial sources
to perform an agency's supply function. The revisions are consistent with changes in the Committee's regulations
which were published in the 

Federal Register

 at 56 FR 48974, September 26, 1991.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

, because the rule will require contractors to purchase certain supply items from the same statutorily mandated sources
that Government agencies are required to use when the contractor is performing an agency's supply function. An Initial
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses
and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered
in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

 (FAR case 91108), in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.
