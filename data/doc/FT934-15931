FT  08 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia's Black Sea oil
shipments fall by 20 per cent
THE VOLATILITY which has characterised Russian oil exports this year appears
to be continuing, with shipments from the Black Sea in the first week of
October down about 20 per cent from the September average of 700,000 barrels
a day, according to shipping agents in London quoted by the Reuters news
agency yesterday.
'The Russians are not able to confirm dates when customers can lift crude
from Novorossiisk,' an Italian refiner said.
The weather in the area has been bad and Novorossiisk, the leading crude
export terminal, was closed on Tuesday because of high winds and swells.
Weather problems have also hit liftings of oil products, mainly gas oil,
from Tuapse and Odessa, other Black Sea ports.
Traders also reported that there were logistical problems at Russian
crude-gathering centres and local transportation difficulties, although one
analyst at a western oil company said he 'didn't see why logistics should
have suddenly broken down'.
He added, however, that 'we don't expect exports to be smooth under present
conditions' affecting the Russian oil industry.
Precise data is unavailable but lack of investment and technical problems in
many Russian fields has caused production to decline steadily this year.
In September an oil industry forecasting group, Asotek, predicted that
Russian production in 1994 would be 327m tonnes, a long way below below this
year's forecast range of between 340m and 350m tonnes.
The Miskar gas field off Sfax on the Tunisian coast was inaugurated
yesterday by British Gas, which is developing the Pounds 492m project.
Completion of the project should make Tunisia self-sufficient in natural
gas.
