FT  06 OCT 94 / Moody's may raise rating
Moody's, the US credit rating agency, said yesterday it might raise its
rating for part of Brazil's foreign debt, Richard Lapper reports. The
action, which affects some Dollars 7.9bn of debt, comes in the wake of Mr
Cardoso's election success this week. Moody's rating on so-called 'interest
due and unpaid' bonds and new money bonds, now B2, could change. The agency
said the review 'is motivated by the likelihood that the incoming
administration will have sufficient power to implement comprehensive
economic and political reforms.' It pointed out that in recent years
Brazil's domestic economy has been relatively dynamic and commercial debt
arrears had been restructured.
