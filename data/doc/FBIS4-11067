  [Text] Montevideo, 20 Apr (AFP-NA) -- Eleuterio Fernandez 
Huidobro, the top leader of the former Tupamaros guerrilla 
movement, today announced his resignation from the leadership of 
the group because of internal disagreements that currently 
divide the Uruguayan left into "moderates" and "radicals." 
  "I am leaving because I do not want to participate in 
internal debates; I do not want to participate in fratricidal 
struggles," Fernandez Huidobro said in a brief explanation to 
the press on the reasons that led him to resign. 
  The former leader of the Tupamaros--a movement that in the 
1960's tried to impose socialism in Uruguay through force and 
then in 1980 chose the democratic way of life after its military 
defeat--is a member of the "radical" sector of the Broad Front 
coalition, which includes the communists and the socialists. 
  Fernandez Huidobro's resignation comes seven months before 
the presidential and legislative elections in which the Broad 
Front is placed by the polls as the country's second biggest 
political force. 
  The former guerrilla chief warned: "I do not want to harm 
the 
left, and for that reason I will not comment any further; but 
when they want me to fight against the common enemy, then I am 
at the service of the Uruguayan people and the Tupamaros."
