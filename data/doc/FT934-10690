FT  04 NOV 93 / Move to block M25 expansion
SURREY County Council yesterday applied to the High Court for judicial
review of government plans to expand parts of the M25 into a 14-lane
motorway.
The plan will go to a public inquiry, due to start next year.
Surrey claims it is impossible to assess accurately the impact of the first
widening proposals, which include link roads between junctions 12 and 15 (M3
to M4) without knowing the consequences of widening further stretches in the
future. No date has been set for hearing the application.
