  [Text] Beijing, March 14 (CNS) -- According to the 
relevant department, since the beginning of this year, steel 
products in China, which once suffered sluggish sales in the 
markets have now had an increasing demand with their prices 
skyrocketing. 
  Since mid-January this year, the prices of steel products' 
futures for construction purposes have been rising rapidly with 
the prices in Suzhou, Tianjin and Shanghai markets for such 
futures set for July and August this year generally rising to 
RMB [renminbi] 3,900 per tone, equal to the highest price in 
1993. 
  The rise of futures' prices has promoted the rise of prices 
in the spot market with some steel plants continuously raising 
the ex- factory prices for steel products while in addition, 
some big dealers on the one hand have been engaged in panic 
purchasing and on the other hand have kept back such products 
from being sold out. Some personnel have warned that if such a 
phenomenon is not kept under control, the skyrocketing of steel 
products' prices would recur. 
  According to experts, the rebound of demand for such 
products 
is one of the factors resulting in the price rise but the main 
factor lies in capital speculative activities.
