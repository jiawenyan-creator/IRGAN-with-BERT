FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Rio Algom shelves disposals
RIO ALGOM, 51 per cent owned by Britain's RTZ, has shelved plans to sell its
metals distribution subsidiaries in North America and Australasia after
failing to attract acceptable offers.
The businesses, which had 1990 sales of CDollars 743m (USDollars 640.5m),
were put on the block last February as part of Rio Algom's strategy of
focusing on mining.
But the Toronto-based company said yesterday the unexpectedly protracted
recession had 'affected the level of interest of prospective purchasers'. It
said offers received so far did not meet its objective of enhancing
shareholder value.
Mr Colin Macaulay, Rio Algom's chief executive, said the delayed economic
recovery had 'significantly altered investment plans of potential buyers in
North America and internationally'. Rio Algom declined to identify the
bidders.
The businesses operate under the names of Atlas Alloys in Canada, Vincent
Metals in the US, and Atlas Steels in Australia and New Zealand. They posted
a combined operating profit of CDollars 37.3m in 1990, but Rio Algom's
third-quarter 1991 report said earnings had been dented by the recession.
NOVA Scotia has put its loss-making Sydney Steel rail mill up for sale,
following a CDollars 275m modernisation.
Sysco, on Cape Breton island, has absorbed nearly CDollars 2bn in public
money since being acquired by the province from the former Hawker Canada
group in 1968.
