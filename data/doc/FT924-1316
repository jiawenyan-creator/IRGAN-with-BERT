FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Kolbenschmidt hit by
restructuring
KOLBENSCHMIDT, the vehicle components maker, plans to shift parts of its
manufacturing capacity out of Germany and close unprofitable divisions in an
attempt to stay competi-tive.
The company, which yesterday announced losses of DM89m (Dollars 57.23m) for
1992 after barely breaking even in the previous year, said the deficit
stemmed mainly from restructuring measures, including the loss of 500 jobs.
It expected performance in the new financial year to be affected by the
increasing signs of falling sales and production in the automotive industry.
The attractions of Germany as a manufacturing site were endangered by high
wages, short working hours and heavy taxation.
The group had also to adapt to changing demands from vehicle makers intent
on reducing the number of suppliers and components.
This meant companies such as Kolbenschmidt would have to supply
fully-assembled modules and systems rather than individual parts.
The company, part of the Metallgesellschaft group, makes engine blocks,
pistons, steering wheels, airbags and bearings.
Group sales rose marginally to DM1.5bn, although turnover in all divisions
except airbags and steering wheels fell.
