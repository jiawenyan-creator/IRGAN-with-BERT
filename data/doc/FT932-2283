FT  19 JUN 93 / Spending cuts plea by Hurd
THE GOVERNMENT must make the case for tight controls on public expenditure,
so when difficult spending decisions are made they will be accepted as fair,
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said yesterday, Alison Smith writes.
He told a meeting of Oxfordshire Conservatives that the need to curb
spending came not just from the longer-than-expected recession, but from the
fall in the number of workers in the population compared with the number of
pensioners, and from rising demands being made of public services.
Mr Hurd's intervention came a day after ministers agreed the toughest
spending limits for 15 years in an attempt to cut public borrowing, and
after prime minister Mr John Major urged colleagues to 'sing from the same
hymn sheet' on tax and manifesto commitments.
Mr Hurd said: 'When the time for decisions comes, in the autumn, they will
have to reflect clearly explained priorities, and they will have to be fair,
and be seen to be fair.'
