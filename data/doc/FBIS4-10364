  [Excerpts] The Electoral Court of the National Encounter 
Alliance [EN] yesterday announced the new EN authorities elected 
during the 27 March elections. Complementary elections will be 
carried out in Canindeyu and San Pedro Departments on 17 April. 
The new executive will take over on 10 April during the EN 
convention. 
  The Electoral Court officially placed Guillermo Caballero 
Vargas as the new EN general coordinator, and Mario Paz Castaing 
and Maria Victoria Brusquetti as assistant coordinators. 
  The court also confirmed the election of the new members of 
the executive board and their respective places according to the 
D'hont proportional system. 
  The result of some polling stations had to be annulled and 
the election in San Pedro de Ycuamandiyu and Canindeyu had to be 
suspended. The Electoral Court stated that, apart from these 
obstacles, the election process was clear and ended 
successfully. [passage omitted]
