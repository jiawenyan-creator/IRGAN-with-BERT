FT  22 OCT 93 / Observer: Fall out
Tough times in Switzerland, where the government's austerity programme is
cutting to the quick, namely into its citizens' allowance for building
nuclear fallout shelters. Through the 1980s, subsidies ran on average at
over SFr100m a year, though they dropped back to SFr90m last year.
The government is not prepared to admit that the need for such shelters has
abated. Rather, it justifies the cutback to a maximum of SFr40m a year with
the observation that shelters now exist for 80 per cent of the 'permanent
resident population'. Something to think about when planning your next trip
to the Alps.
