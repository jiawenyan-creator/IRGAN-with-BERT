FT  28 MAY 92 / Reform of pensions law urged
A THOROUGH overhaul of the legal basis for the UK's 400,000 occupational
pension schemes was called for yesterday by the chairman of the Investment
Management Regulatory Organisation, one of the City's investment regulators.
The comments of Mr George Nissen in a speech to a London conference appeared
to have been prompted by the plight of Maxwell pensioners, although he did
not mention the late Mr Robert Maxwell by name.
'There has never been an attempt to establish an occupational pension scheme
system set in a sound, purpose-built legislative framework,' Mr Nissen said.
Referring to a parliamentary investigation of the handling of pension and
other trusts nearly a century ago, he said: 'The problems that existed in
1895 are still with us today.
'The existing system should be reviewed and the results of that review used
in establishing a sound . . . system on a firm legislative foundation.'
Mr Nissen also complained that responsibility for the running of pension
schemes was spread between too many agencies. 'The number of agencies and
professionals involved in the administration is so great and their
responsibilities so unclear that cracks were almost bound to develop,' he
said.
