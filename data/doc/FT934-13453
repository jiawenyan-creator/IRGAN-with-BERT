FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: BankAmerica flat in third term
UNDERLYING earnings at BankAmerica remained flat in the third quarter as the
US's second biggest banking group continued to struggle against a weak
economy in its home state, California.
After paying out Dollars 26m in what it termed a 'special recognition award'
to employees following the merger with Security Pacific, net income in the
three months was Dollars 486m, or Dollars 1.19 a share.
This compared with after-tax earnings of Dollars 488m in the previous three
months and Dollars 476m, or Dollars 1.22 per share, in the third quarter of
1992.
'Economic weakness continued to constrain our overall business volume,' said
Mr Richard Rosen-berg, chairman and chief executive.
The bank continued to focus on controlling costs, he added.
Operating costs, at Dollars 1.85bn, were level with the previous three
months, though ahead of the Dollars 1.79bn of the 1992 third quarter.
Net interest income, at Dollars 1.88bn, was identical to the level in the
same period a year before, though up from Dollars 1.85bn in the second
quarter of this year.
Non-interest income, at Dollars 1bn, was down by Dollars 49m from the
previous quarter due to lower profits from asset sales and a decline in
foreign exchange trading income, from Dollars 108m to Dollars 76m.
Provisions for credit losses during the period fell to Dollars 175m, from
Dollars 200m in the previous three months.
In common with other US banks, BankAmerica reported a further rise in the
ratio of loan-loss reserves to non-performing loans, which now stands at 122
per cent, up from 110 per cent.
The bank's tier one capital ratio climbed to 7.2 per cent, from 6.9 per cent
at the end of June.
