  [Text] Brother Sa'id Salim Ba-huqaybah, the commissioner 
of the province of Suqutrah, has denied allegations by the 
bloody al-Ahmar gang's radio in Sanaa that a public 
demonstration was witnessed in Suqutrah. The radio claimed that 
the demonstration supported Sanaa's legitimacy. Brother 
Ba-huqaybah told the Yemeni news agency, SABA', in Aden, that 
there was absolutely no truth to those claims. The truth was 
that the masses in the province organized a demonstration on the 
morning of 26 May in which they declared their support for the 
establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. He pointed 
out that the participants in the demonstration sent a cable of 
support, in the name of the masses and all the civil and 
military institutions in the province, to the brother chairman 
and members of the Presidential Council, in which they expressed 
their full and absolute support for the young Republic. In the 
cable they strongly condemned the bloody war sparked off by the 
bloody al-Ahmar gang, under the leadership of that ignorant 
shedder of blood, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, against the sons of our 
Yemeni people.
