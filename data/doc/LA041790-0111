REEBOK PICKS INFINITI AD PRODUCER AS NEW AGENCY 
Reebok International on Monday awarded its estimated $40-million advertising 
account to Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, the Boston-based agency that 
created the controversial campaign for Infiniti cars. 
Hill Holliday replaces Los Angeles-based Chiat/Day/Mojo, which in February 
announced that it and Reebok had agreed to break off their three-year 
relationship. 
Chiat/Day/Mojo, which will continue to handle Reebok's international 
advertising, was later asked to submit a presentation, said an agency spokesman 
in New York. 
Hill Holliday President Jack Sansolo, who was visiting the agency's Los Angeles 
office on Monday, said his firm's presentation to Reebok called for a 
significantly different campaign than that created by Chiat/Day/Mojo. But he 
would not reveal any details of the new advertising, which is scheduled to 
break during the back-to-school season. 
Reebok "was looking for the best work that would take them over the long term," 
said Sansolo. "Everyone here is very excited." 
Reebok will become one of Hill Holliday's three largest accounts, which include 
Hyatt Corp. and Infiniti, Nissan Motor Co.'s new luxury automobile division. 
The agency's campaign to introduce Infiniti created a stir because it featured 
images of forests, streams and rocks, but no cars. More recent ads feature the 
automobile. 
Other firms competing for the Reebok account included Levine, Huntley, Schmidt 
&amp; Beaver; Waring &amp; LaRosa, and DDB Needham Worldwide.
