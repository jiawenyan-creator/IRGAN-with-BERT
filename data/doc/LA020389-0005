EARNINGS 
International Lease Finance Corp.'s 1988 profit dropped 15% to $43 million. The 
Beverly Hills firm said the results were due in part to lower gains on flight 
equipment marketing and delays in deliveries of aircraft from McDonnell Douglas 
and Fokker. In addition, tighter competitive conditions existing at the time of 
certain lease transactions during 1987 resulted in lower overall operating 
margins for 1988, the firm said.
