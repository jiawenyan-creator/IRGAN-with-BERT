FT  03 JUN 92 / Management: The road to recovery - Peugeot and Renault have
made big strides to put their chequered pasts behind them. William Dawkins
says they now plan to take on the Japanese carmakers
It used to be said that French carmakers would be knocked spinning by
Japanese competition once Europe lifted its curbs on car imports at the end
of the decade.
Now is the time to send that view to the crusher. Over the past decade,
Peugeot and Renault, the country's two main car groups, have retreated from
the brink of bankruptcy and top executives at both believe they can catch up
and fight on equal terms with Japan.
Last year, the Peugeot group, which also includes Citroen, was the world's
most profitable carmaker in terms of net sales margins. Renault staged a
startling recovery, with more than doubled net profits, and outsold all
foreign competition in the fast growing German market.
Can these be the same companies that were one of Europe's biggest industrial
headaches 10 years ago? Not quite. Since then, they have made big increases
in quality, productivity and efficiency.
European volume producers took more than twice as long per man as their
Japanese counterparts to make a car in 1989, according to a seminal study by
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)*. Today, French carmakers'
productivity is a mere 10 per cent behind that of Japanese car producers in
Britain, itself 10 per cent behind the Japanese in Japan, says another study
by consultants McKinsey.
Just how Peugeot and Renault came so far is instructive to other European
manufacturing industries aiming to match Japanese productivity standards.
Like carmakers across the world, the French have made deep cuts in their
workforces, down by 25 per cent over the past five years at Renault and 5
per cent at the leaner Peugeot. They still have a long way to go, according
to a recent study by the French planning commission, which estimates that
the French car industry must trim its labour force by another 2.5 per cent a
year for the rest of the decade to be competitive.
Job cuts are only part of the story. Peugeot and Renault have have also made
profound changes in the way people and stocks are organised, overturning old
hierarchies and introducing Japanese-style project and production management
teams.
Peugeot reckons to have improved the number of cars made per man by 50 per
cent in five years, while Renault says it has improved its productivity by 6
per cent per year over the same period. Both aim to repeat that improvement
by the end of the decade.
This is partly the result of heavy investment in automated production lines
in the mid-1980s. The investment has not been an unqualified success,
however. Recently, they have re-introduced more labour and simpler machines
to the shopfloor, because the new robots broke down too often.
This is revealing, for as the MIT study pointed out, organisation is more
important than automation in even the most modern Japanese plants. Again,
Renault and Peugeot applied a lesson from Japan by breaking down the old
production line into small, autonomous units, each responsible for product
quality and machine maintenance.
This has already enabled Peugeot to close the refinishing departments which
used to occupy 10 to 20 per cent of total production time. 'Now each team
does its own refinishing on the production line and is taught to treat the
next team down the line as a customer,' says Jean-Yves Helmer, director of
the Peugeot group's car division.
French carmakers see themselves today, like their Japanese competitors, as
primarily designers and assemblers. They have mostly stopped being highly
integrated, although they still make what they consider to be strategic
components like automatic gearboxes, where Peugeot and Renault are
considering collaborating. Bought-in components have risen to just over 60
per cent of costs at Peugeot and 67 per cent at Renault, a steep rise over
recent years.
Renault has set up a 'make or buy committee', which treats in-house
suppliers on the same footing as external components makers, says Philippe
Gras, deputy chief executive. Like the Japanese, the French have started to
work more closely with component suppliers, to the extent of consulting on
new designs.
Peugeot and Renault have for the past five years been running joint audits
to keep component suppliers' quality up to the mark, grading them - Japanese
style again - according to their ability to do their own quality control.
They are thinking of extending this system to cover suppliers' productivity
too.
Suppliers are also expected to deliver more frequently to match the
just-in-time stock control which is now commonplace in both groups'
factories. Peugeot, for example, has reduced its stocks of unfinished goods
from 12 days' supply in 1984 to four days last year. But this technique is
also a risk for French carmakers, because they cannot guarantee
Japanese-style labour stability. Renault discovered this to its cost last
year when a strike at its engine and gearbox plant took 10 days to bring its
entire French and Belgian car production to a halt.
Design management is another important element in productivity where the
French are quickly applying lessons from the Far East. Japan still designs
and launches new cars much faster and more cheaply than France, for around
FFr3-4bn (Pounds 300m-Pounds 400m) in three years, as against the French
average of FFr6-8bn in four to five years.
Renault and Peugeot have taken similar approaches to the problem. Formerly,
new cars were designed in a cumbersome way, with the blueprint passing from
the design department through engineering and production management. Both
companies have in the past three years started setting up project teams,
which bring together all departments involved in a new car launch to work
simultaneously.
design teams of its two sister companies under a single management to help
them work faster and expects to produce the first concrete results for new
models from 1994.
Both agree that despite the progress, one big problem remains. French
carworkers are older and less educated than their Japanese counterparts.
'Gigantic efforts,' are needed to correct this handicap, says the planning
commission report, which calls for heavy public spending on retraining.
'We have from now until the year 2000 to get up to the right level. All of
us in the company know we can do it,' says Gras.
