  [Excerpt] A new political party was created today. The 
Union of Social Forces [Union des Forces Sociales], UFOS, 
announced its formation this morning at the People's Palace 
press center during a news conference. 
  The new party intends to find solutions to the nation's 
problems. It springs from the ashes of civil society. This 
group has been set up to guide society's actions because civil 
society, which was supposed to be the product of the people's 
aspirations, is disconnected and resembles a 36-headed monster. 
This party, which is coordinated by Martin Kavundza, includes 
the following associations: trade unions, cultural circles, 
athletic clubs, nongovernmental organizations, student 
movements, and friendly societies. 
  The UFOS is therefore in solidarity with all these 
associations. It wants politicians to help defuse the situation. 
Martin Kavundza stressed that the party proclaims its 
independence from the other forces. It also strongly supports 
the gains of the national sovereign conference. [passage
