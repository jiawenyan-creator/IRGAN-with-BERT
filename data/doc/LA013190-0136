BECKMAN POSTS LOWER PROFITS AND FLAT SALES 
Beckman Instruments on Tuesday reported flat sales and slightly lower profits 
for its fourth quarter and year. 
For the year ended Dec. 31, the Fullerton-based manufacturer of scientific and 
diagnostic medical instruments said its sales were $785.9 million, a 2% 
increase from 1988. 
Earnings were $41.9 million, compared to $42.5 million a year earlier. 
For the quarter, Beckman reported earnings of $10.4 million and sales of $199.7 
million, compared to earnings of $11.2 million and sales of $199.1 million 
during the corresponding period in 1988. 
The company attributed its sluggish performance to declining sales to publicly 
funded laboratories and private firms. Beckman Chairman Louis Rosso said many 
corporations were spending more on research and development and less on new 
equipment during the year. He also said publicly funded research labs have 
slowed spending because of cutbacks in their funding. 
Rosso said he expected declining sales in the public sector to continue at 
least through the first half of this year. 
"The instrumentation market in the medical and scientific fields has become 
somewhat soft," said Steven Gerber, medical technology analyst with the Los 
Angeles brokerage Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards.
