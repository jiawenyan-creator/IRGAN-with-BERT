FT  18 JUL 94 / The Markets: Elections set the tone - Global Investor
Over the next three months, political considerations will set the tone in
some of the biggest investment markets in the Americas. Leave aside, for the
moment, President Clinton's little local difficulties with healthcare reform
and mid-term elections: voters to the north and south will make their own
procession to the polls to make decisions with the potential for large
effects on markets.
It starts with presidential elections next month in Mexico, a country
stricken by political uncertainty for much of this year. It then shifts to
Canada at the end of September, the likely date for a regional vote which
once again raises the spectre of Quebec devolution.
It moves to Brazil in October, for the voters' verdict on the
administration's latest economic stabilisation plan.
To varying degrees, investors in each of these countries have demanded a
risk premium to maintain their involvement. And in each market, foreign
investors, normally a substantial part of the investment scene, have been
notable by their absence.
In Mexico and Canada, at least, a return of overseas capital seems likely
later this year.
The political risk premium implicit in Mexico and Brazil is probably
clearest in the valuation bases of their stock markets relative to other
Latin markets.
Half-way through this year, Mr Geoffrey Dennis at Bear Stearns estimated
that Mexican shares were on a multiple of 13.5 times this year's earnings,
with Brazil at 12.3 times. For 1995, this falls to 10.8 times projected
earnings for Mexico and 10.4 times for Brazil, about a point less that the
regional average.
For the Latin stock markets as a whole these sort of multiples make for a
better investment case than at the peak levels reached by the end of
January.
From there share prices fell on average by a third, courtesy of Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and then failed to sustain a
rebound in June, again echoing the pattern of US markets. Unless the US bond
market goes into another spasm this autumn, the stage seems set for a more
stable second half.
Mexico could soon be due for a respite from the political uncertainty which
has followed the Chiapas uprising and Colosio assasination.
The August 21 election will no doubt be a messy affair with perhaps the loss
by the ruling PRI party of its two-thirds majority in Congress. But the PRI
is expected to maintain its hold on the administration.
If the foreign capital flowing into Mexico picks up after the election, it
could help to bring its own reward. Renewed investment would take the
pressure off the peso, allowing interest rates to ease back and bolstering
economic growth, which in turn will support share prices.
The outcome of Brazil's autumn presidential elections seem far more open to
doubt, implying greater volatility in Brazilian financial markets over the
coming months. 'Volatile' and 'Brazil' are words which fit neatly together.
Shares soared 60 per cent early this year, fell almost as much, and then
rebounded further than most other Latin markets.
The latest Brazilian currency, the real, was introduced only on July 1, with
a commitment by the administration to put a sizeable chunk of the country's
foreign currency reserves to defending its parity with the dollar.
It is a giant game of poker. Will this anti-inflationary message produce the
desired effect? Or will the markets call the government's bluff?
The autumn election, the first round of which is on October 3, could hang on
the result. Holding the country's hyper-inflation in check would do wonders
for the political credibility of Mr Fernando Cardoso, the finance minister,
as consumers experienced the novelty of stable shop prices, well, stable
relative to past experience, at least.
Recent opinion poll advances by Mr Cardoso, from a very weak position, have
already put some zest in share prices. Whatever doubts hang over the
long-term picture, there seems plenty of room for a short-term rebound later
this year.
Mr Dennis predicts a return of the stock market index to 3,100 by the end of
the year, while Ms Tamzin Hobday at Barings is estimating a more modest
bounce to 2,900.
9% real yield?
Canada's own political uncertainty has contributed to a remarkable turn of
events in its financial markets. The possibility of a real yield of nearly 9
per cent on ten-year government bonds
The intimate connection between the future of Quebec and the country's
massive budget deficit explain this seemingly bizarre position.
The debt levels are the immediate cause of the market's concern. Taken
together, federal and state debts amount to more than 100 per cent of the
country's GDP. Higher interest rates have made the situation worse, adding
to financing costs and pushing the debt level higher.
Concern about Quebec has set a match to the concern. If the seperatists gain
power in September, they have promised a referendum on devolution within a
year. Who, then, would be liable for the federal debt?
This is not the first time the Quebec Question has led to a foreign investor
strike and thrown the Canadian markets into a tizzy. The reality, though,
may be less alarmist. Opinion polls suggest that a referendum would not
bring support for a free-standing Quebec. And even if it did, the Parti
Quebecois has expressed its willingness to take on a share of the federal
debt.
The realisation that there has been an over-reaction in the financial
markets has already driven a recovery in the bond market in the past
fortnight. The spread between ten-year US and Canadian bonds, which shot up
to more than 220 basis points towards the end of June, has since dropped
back to about 160. The steady flow of Canadian dollar eurobonds over the
past week testifies to the renewed interest of foreign investors.
With headline inflation at zero, though (and underlying inflation not much
over 1 per cent,) the real yield still looks remarkable. Assuming the
government does not reverse course and inflate its way out of its debt hole,
there are likely to be buying opportunities ahead.
