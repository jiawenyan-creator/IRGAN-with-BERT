  [Text] Lieutenant General Husayn Kamil al-Majid, son-in-law 
and special adviser to the Iraqi president and head of the 
Military Industrialization Organization [MIO], returned to 
Baghdad last week accompanied by members of his family and Iraqi 
officials. 
  He underwent brain surgery to remove shrapnel from a bomb 
that exploded in his office at the MIO while he was entering it 
two weeks ago. 
  After surviving the assassination attempt, he received first 
aid assistance and medical treatment in Baghdad, but his 
condition deteriorated. He was then moved by a special plane to 
the al-Husayn Medical Center where he underwent the operation 
and convalesced for 10 days under rhe supervision of three 
surgeons who were summoned from Britain for this purpose.
