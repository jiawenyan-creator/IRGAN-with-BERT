  [Text] Ankara, May 13 (A.A.) -- Parliament Speaker 
Husamettin Cindoruk met Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 
[TRNC] Prime Minister Hakki Atun today. 
  `Turkey will not accept a solution that is against TRNC,' 
Cindoruk said. 
  Cindoruk, speaking during a meeting with Atun, said Turkey 
supports a solution on the Cyprus issue but it should not be 
one-sided and forcible. 
  Atun said that the TRNC parliament has no intention of 
making 
concessions on the Cyprus issue adding that the Turkish 
parliament always supported the TRNC and called the recent UN 
proposals `unacceptable.' 
  He said the UN-proposed confidence-building measures failed 
to create a secure atmosphere. 
  `The package was an instrument to seize land from TRNC,' he 
said. 
  Atun said although they made changes in the 
confidence-building measures to satisfy Greek Cypriot leader 
Kliridhis, Turkey still continues its goodwill to mend the 
situation.
