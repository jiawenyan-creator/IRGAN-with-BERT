THE SIDELINES; 
DRUG EVIDENCE IGNORED, PANEL TOLD 
Top track and field officials had proof several months before the 1988 Olympics 
that Canadian athletes were taking steroids, but did nothing, a federal inquiry 
on drugs in amateur sports was told today. 
Steven Findlay, a staff member of the Canadian Track and Field Assn., testified 
he told association President Wilf Wedman in February, 1988, that he had proof 
of steroid use among the country's top sprinters. His evidence was based on a 
statement by decathlete Dave Steen that he had been offered steroids by Ben 
Johnson's doctor, Jamie Astaphan. Findlay testified Steen also told him that 
Astaphan admitted he was injecting sprinter Angela Issajenko with steroids. 
But Wedman, who left the association in early 1988, said the evidence was not 
enough and refused to even acknowledge the growing problem of drugs in amateur 
sport, Findlay said. 
Wedman is scheduled to take the witness stand next month.
