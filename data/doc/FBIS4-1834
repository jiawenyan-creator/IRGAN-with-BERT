  [Text] At the Legislative Yuan today, Premier Lien Chan 
commented for the first time on the law of investment protection 
for Taiwan compatriots adopted by the Chinese Communists. He 
pointed out: Basically, the law shows that the Chinese 
Communists are still playing the trick of one country, two 
systems. If they truly want to protect investment from outside, 
they should sign agreements that meet international 
requirements. We cannot rashly enter into all-around, in-depth 
economic contact with the mainland simply because the Chinese 
Communists passed an incomprehensive, nonspecific law.
