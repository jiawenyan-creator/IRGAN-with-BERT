FONTANA SEEDED FIRST IN DIVISION I; 
PREP FOOTBALL: FOUNTAIN VALLEY GETS SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFF BERTH BECAUSE OF 
HUNTINGTON BEACH FORFEITS, AND WILL FACE NO. 1 STEELERS FRIDAY. 
Fontana High School, The Times' top-ranked team, was seeded first in the 
Southern Section Division I football playoff pairings, which were announced 
Sunday. 
The Steelers (10-0), the Citrus Belt League champions, will play host to 
Fountain Valley, the defending Division I champion, Friday in the first round. 
There were 16 teams selected in each division, and the finals are scheduled 
Dec. 8-9. 
Fountain Valley, which finished fourth in the Sunset League, qualified when 
Huntington Beach, the Sunset League champion, had to forfeit its eight 
victories because it used an ineligible player. Because of the forfeits, 
Fountain Valley qualified as the league's third-place team with a 3-2 league 
record and a 5-5 overall mark. 
The other seeded Division I teams are Long Beach Poly of the Moore League, 
Loyola of the Del Rey League and La Puente Bishop Amat of the Angelus League. 
In Division III, Capistrano Valley of the South Coast League, is the top-seeded 
team with a 10-0 record. The other seeded teams are El Toro, the runner-up in 
the South Coast League, Los Alamitos of the Empire League and Paramount, the 
San Gabriel Valley League and defending Division III champion. 
In a controversial decision, Dana Hills of the South Coast League received an 
at-large bid instead of Lynwood of the San Gabriel Valley League. 
Dana Hills finished the regular season with a 7-3 record but lost three of its 
last five games. Lynwood (5-5) won four of its last five games. Lynwood, which 
played its early-season schedule without quarterback Charles Levy, has lost 
only to Bishop Amat, 28-21, since Oct. 6.
