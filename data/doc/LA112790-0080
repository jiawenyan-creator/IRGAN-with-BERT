UNITED WAY VOLUNTEERS SALUTED 
Our Ventura County residents have benefited immensely from the philanthropic 
community's unparalleled giving to United Way, with 64 agencies and other 
nonprofit organizations. Through hundreds of thousands of these citizens, who 
volunteer their time and give money, hope has been given to those searching for 
a warm shelter, learning how to read and needing food for their family. 
Giving in Ventura County reached an all-time high in 1989 as United Way donors 
contributed $5.6 million. This year's goal is to raise more than $6 million so 
that 250 programs will continue to be available to those who need help. 
Thanks to the large number of volunteers who support these programs, the impact 
of monetary contributions is many-fold greater than it would be otherwise.
