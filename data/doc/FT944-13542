FT  27 OCT 94 / People: Eurotunnel
Mike Grant, 41, a former Laing &amp; Cruickshank stockbroker, has taken over as
group treasurer of Eurotunnel where he will be responsible for managing the
group's Pounds 8bn debt and relations with its 220 banks.
Grant, who joined Eurotunnel in 1987 and is a member of the association of
corporate treasurers, is taking charge of an expanded department following
Eurotunnel's decision to merge its treasurer's and corporate finance
departments.
The former has been responsible for areas such as the management of the
group's interest rate and foreign exchange exposure and the corporate
finance department has been concerned with bank negotiations, financial
analysis and equity issues.
Now that Eurotunnel has raised the bulk of its capital, the group is
consolidating its financial side under Graham Corbett, the chief financial
officer. Peter Ratzer, 55, currently director of corporate finance, is
becoming a senior financial adviser before taking early retirement towards
the middle of 1995 and Patrick Fulhaber, 48, who has been treasurer since
1991, is returning to France.
Grant, who was corporate finance manager, will also take over responsibility
for the bank and investor relations department in his new role.
