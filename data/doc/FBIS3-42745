the Outcome of Voting in the Parliamentary Elections"] 
  [Text] The Agrarian-Democratic Party of Moldova will get 
33-35 percent of the votes of the electorate in the 
parliamentary elections on 27 February. Such was the projection 
made in the newspaper GRAZHDANSKIY MIR by Anatoliy Gudym, chief 
of the expert center of the Union of Industrialists of Moldova. 
  He believes that "the current critical situation speaks 
against the Agrarians; after all, they have been in power for 
more than a year. What change can there be if their ticket 
includes the same few dozen current members of parliament?" 
  Gudym writes: "Next, I would rank two parties on an equal 
footing--the Social-Democratic Party (they have to their credit 
political initiatives and the European model for reforming the 
economy) and the reform party, which has sprung up unexpectedly." 
  In the opinion of the expert, the Socialists will surmount 
the 4 percent barrier for admission to the parliament, although 
they have weakened themselves by forming a bloc with the Unity 
movement. The Democratic Labor Party is making its presence 
known as a defender of the interests of industry. 
  Gudym believes that the future parliament will have more 
professional politicians, economists, lawyers, and sociologists. 
The newspaper writes: "This gives us hope that this year we will 
get a new Constitution and an administrative-territorial 
structure, refine our economic legislation, and master the 
privatization of enterprises, land, and housing in practice."
