Former Pro Bowl running back Tony Collins, 31, signed a one-year contract with 
the Miami Dolphins, a few days after the NFL lifted his suspension for drug 
abuse. 
"I want to thank Coach (Don) Shula for sticking his neck out for me, and I'm 
not going to cut it off," Collins said. 
Collins said he has not used drugs for a year and a half. His worst binge came 
after the NFL ban when a cocaine overdose sent him to an Indianapolis hospital. 
Collins spent seven seasons with New England, rushing for 4,647 yards, catching 
passes for 2,356 yards and scoring 44 touchdowns. 
Shula decided those numbers made the 184-pound Collins worth a gamble. Collins 
said at least five other teams rejected his request for a tryout.
