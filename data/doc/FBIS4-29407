  [Text] The National Defense Ministry disclosed that North 
Korea has not demonstrated any peculiar military moves, while it 
is now intensifying its peace offensive to the United States

President Kim Il-song as momentum. 
  The Ministry of National Defense disclosed in a report on 
moves by North Korea: North Korea is proclaiming over loud 
speakers directed at the South's front line that it neither has 
the intention nor the capability to develop nuclear weapons, 
while stressing that they will not withdraw from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency until the nuclear issue is 
resolved through dialogue [iaearul taltoe haji anul kossimul

  The Ministry of National Defense also disclosed: Although 
the North Korean Air Force continues to be somewhat actively 
engaged in flight exercises, its ground force and Navy are not 
showing any particular movements except their routine guard 
activities.
