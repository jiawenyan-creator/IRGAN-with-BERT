FT  20 DEC 94 / Warning on costs of protectionism
A senior Indonesian minister yesterday warned that protectionism would raise
local production costs and erode the international competitiveness of
Indonesian industry.
The warning from Mr Ginanjar Kartasasmita, the planning minister, came amid
a growing debate in Indonesia over efforts by a private company, PT Chandra
Asri, to obtain protection for a Dollars 1.7bn petrochemicals complex being
built in west Java. The main backers of the project include President
Suharto's second son Bambang Trihatmodjo.
'We have to be very selective in protecting our firms since this raises
costs for downstream users, which in turn makes these industries less
competitive,' Mr Ginanjar told a conference on manufacturing.
'We have to ensure that protection does not constitute a government subsidy
to non-competitive businesses, denying these resources to infrastructure,
education and health, which are fundamental to our long-term development
success,' he said.
The Chandra Asri debate has been front-page news with economists, former
ministers and finance minister Mar'ie Muhammad speaking out against
protectionism.
The company has asked for tariff barriers of up to 40 per cent for its
plant, which is expected to produce ethylene and propylene. The tariffs
would protect the Chandra Asri plant, due to come on stream next year, from
cheaper imports. The company argues the protection is necessary because it
will take several years before Chandra Asri becomes profitable.
