  [Text] Johannesburg Dec 31 SAPA -- The Democratic Party 
[DP] on Friday entered the fray over defecting members of the 
armed wing of the African National Congress [ANC], claiming many 
former Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- MK] cadres had 
"enthusiastically" joined the DP because of dissatisfaction with 
the ANC. 
  On Thursday the National Party made a similar claim which 
was 
dismissed by the ANC with "contempt and disgust". 
  On Friday Jack Bloom, the DP's southern Transvaal chairman 
of 
expansion, said he was not surprised former Umkhonto we Sizwe 
members were joining other political parties. "Throughout this 
year, a large number of former MK soldiers have enthusiastically 
joined the DP, invariably because of dissatisfaction over ill 
treatment by the ANC and misgivings at the real commitment of 
the ANC to democracy," he said. 
  He added: "The ANC must learn to accept healthy competition 
together with the fact that it is losing many members by its 
internal authoritarian practices. It is our information, in 
fact, that many nominal ANC members will cast their vote for a 
different political party once they are assured of the secrecy 
of the ballot. We believe that current defections to our own 
ranks are but the tip of the iceberg as far as support that will 
translated into votes on election day."
