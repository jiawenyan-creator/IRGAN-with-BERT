  [Text] Budapest, 11 Feb (MTI) -- "If this is the NATO that 
Hungary strives so hard to become a member of, then we can rest 
assured: Perhaps the common conscience of societies is still 
alive," writes an article in the Friday issue of the national 
daily MAGYAR HIRLAP, commenting on the NATO ultimatum to the 
Serbs. 
  "No one is overjoyed that the situation has gone this far. 
The aim of the ultimatum is to force a withdrawal, rather than 
to implement air strikes. It is regrettable that the latest 
manoeuvres of Russian policy weaken precisely the power of 
threat, and in a manner that almost encourages the Serbs to hold 
on to their positions," writes the daily. 
  According to NEPSZABADSAG, the ultimatum clearly foreshadows 
an increase in the arbitrating, or policing, role of NATO. The 
daily terms it noteworthy that "the United Nations is preparing 
to strike with NATO's fist for the first time ever." 
  "The elimination of the U.N. Security Council, that is 
Moscow 
and Beijing, from such a major decision is the first sign in the 
reorganization of the world's power positions. 
  "At the end of ten days, when the ultimatum expires, or 
perhaps even sooner, the world will know whether Russia is as 
weak as to have the affairs of the world settled without it, or 
in spite of it," the daily writes. 
  According to UJ MAGYARORSZAG, after the cautious approach of 
the long months and years, the Brussels decision came almost as 
a surprise. However, it was at least as late as it was 
surprising, the daily notes, for Karadzic and his allies have 
almost fully achieved their goals by now, thanks to the delaying 
conduct shown by the West. 
  As regards the Russian protest, the daily notes: "Inasmuch 
as 
the air strikes do begin, then something could possibly be 
achieved in Bosnia, however, it would lead to a dangerous break 
between Russia and the West."
