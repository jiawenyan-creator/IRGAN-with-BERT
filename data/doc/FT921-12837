FT  24 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Broad range of influences
leaves bourses mixed
A BROAD range of influences, both domestic and international, left bourses
mixed yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT eased on profit-taking, on strike threats and on an easier German
bond market. Volume fell from DM7.4bn to DM6.2bn as the FAZ index fell 4.29
to 680.83 at midsession, followed by a 10.53 fall to 1,669.57 in the DAX at
the close.
Carmakers reflected worries that a steel strike could hit their production:
BMW fell DM5 to DM511.50, and Daimler-Benz by DM6 to DM744.50. Engineers and
steelmakers were mixed to lower, Deutsche Babcock losing DM7 to DM168 after
starring in the German equities upsurge with a 27 per cent gain this year.
Some secondary stocks showed gains. The software group, SAP, put on DM100 to
DM1,610 on strong 1991 results; and GEA, the environmental engineering
group, closed DM5 higher at DM525 after a previous two-day gain of 6 per
cent.
Mr Brian Wilkinson of Paribas Capital Markets said that GEA had been strong
ahead of a meeting with analysts yesterday, and improved on hopes that the
company, which has had acquisitional growth, could improve this year on an
internal efficiency drive.
Yesterday's outperformer was Horten, the retail group, up DM7 to DM197 for a
two-day gain of 8.8 per cent, as turnover in the shares doubled from DM13m
to DM26m.
MILAN recovered from the technical weakness of the previous few days, but
was held up by another breakdown in the electronic trading system. The Comit
index rose 10.32 to 548.27 in turnover estimated at L140bn after Wednesday's
L105bn. Trading continued to be led by domestic operators.
Insurers remained in the limelight, with Generali up L660 to L31,050 and
gaining another L200 after hours. Alleanza put on L500 to L12,150. La
Fondiaria rose L1,400 to L38,700 as three of its subsidiaries, La
Previdente, Latina and Ausonia were suspended pending news of a
restructuring later in the day. After the close, Fondiaria said that it
planned to fuse Ausonia with La Previdente on the basis of one La Previdente
share for every 22 Ausonia shares.
PARIS ended slightly lower, trading was dominated by technical factors ahead
of today's close of the January account. The CAC 40 index fell 2.63 to
1,838.69 in turnover of FFr2.2bn after FFr2.3bn.
Credit Local de France, a newcomer to the financial sector, rose FFr8 to
FFr225 in unusually high volume of 311,000 shares.
Saint-Gobain rose FFr5.90 to FFr494.10 as investors waited for its 1991
results. After the close, the building company announced a 25.6 per cent
fall in profits. LVMH, the luxury good manufacturer, fell FFr30 to FFr4,290
ahead of announcing a pleasing 11 per cent rise in turnover.
AMSTERDAM moved back throughout the day, finishing lower as activity
dwindled ahead of this weekend's G7 meeting. Inflation worries in Germany
stemming from the steel industry wage demand there also kept investors on
the sidelines. The CBS Tendency Index closed down 0.4 at 120.9.
MADRID had a flat day with the only interest coming in block trades,
following Wednesday's trend. Block trades of 556,050 in Acesa at Pta1,155
and of 331,000 in Endesa at Pta3,025 were confirmed. The general index
closed off 0.29 to 251.07.
OSLO was dragged down by Norsk Hydro after the company said that it would
take a special charge of NKr2.4bn against fourth quarter pre-tax earnings to
cover the planned restructuring measures and writedowns of assets within
Hydro's agriculture and magnesium divisions.
The all-share index fell 9.88, or 2.2 per cent to 443.78, in turnover of
NKr314.3m. Hydro shed NKr12.5 at NKr144.5.
STOCKHOLM closed broadly up, but below the day's highs, in active trade
following advances in New York and in reaction to an unexpected decline in
consumer prices. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 7.93 at 974.35 on
turnover of SKr594m, reversing a two-day slide. Consumer prices fell 0.1 per
cent in December after rising 0.5 per cent the month previously.
HELSINKI closed higher, after sliding for the past four trading days, as
buyers returned. The Hex index rose 6.4 to 854.8 in turnover of FM17.5m, of
which free shares made up FM6.2m. The most traded issue was Kymmene free
shares, which rose 90 penni to FM79.
COPENHAGEN closed slightly lower in fairly active trading with Danisco, the
food and drink group, recovering after its recent heavy fall. Danisco, which
has declined some DKr200 since reporting first-half results in December,
gained DKr13 to DKr825. Banks were steady, while Hafnia stood out in a
little changed insurance sector with a DKr14 rise to DKr419.
ISTANBUL was lifted by last-minute buying. The 75-share index closed at a
provisional 4,873.76, up 75.75 or 1.6 per cent.
