  [Text] Paris, 23 Mar (INA) -- Iraq has warned it may be hit 
by an environmental disaster from the continuing sanctions. 
  A memorandum submitted by the Iraqi parliamentary delegation 
to the 91st congress of the International Parliamentary Union, 
now in session in Paris, notes a rising level of pollution and 
the emergence of symptoms of previously unknown diseases. The 
Iraqi paper also notes an increased incidence of illnesses among 
women and children, including a higher-than-usual number of 
miscarriages and babies born with deformities. 
  The memorandumm stresses that extensive use of depleted 
uranium in the missiles fired during the aggression on Iraq may 
bring about an environmental disaster, whose effects will be 
felt for many years to come. This is in addition to 
environmental pollution from crude oil and oil-based products. 
  The memorandum blames the sanction-caused scarcity of 
finances and technical resources for the difficulties involved 
in destroying waste and maintaining a healthy environment. 
  The paper appeals to the parliamentarians to direct that 
living in a healthy environment falls under the human rights 
heading and that sanctions arising from political disputes 
should exclude substances required for the protection of the 
environment. 
  Iraq's delegation to the congress is led by National 
Assembly 
Speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih.
