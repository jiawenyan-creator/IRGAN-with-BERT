  [Text] Tokyo, May 4 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- The 
Aime prefectural 100 men committee for early normalisation of 
Japan-DPRK diplomatic relations sent a letter of request to the 
Japanese prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary on April 
27, demanding the early normalization of DPRK-Japan diplomatic 
relations. 
  The letter of request said that the grave situation of the 
Korean peninsula is the result that Japan has pursued the 
hostile policy toward the DPRK in league with the United States, 
instead of liquidating its past colonial rule. 
  Japan should no longer coil up the tension, clamouring about 
"nuclear suspicion in the North", but make efforts to normalize 
the diplomatic relations and strive for peace in the Korean 
peninsula and Asia, it noted.
