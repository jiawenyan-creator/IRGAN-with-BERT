FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting helps Pharmacia to
half-time profits of SKr2.66bn
Pharmacia, the newly-privatised Swedish drugs group, yesterday reported a
better-than-expected profit of SKr2.66bn (Dollars 343m) for the first six
months as sales reached SKr13.7bn.
The group said it was difficult to compare its figures with the same 1993
period because of the acquisition of the Italian pharmaceuticals group
Farmitalia Carlo Erba (FICE) in May 1993.
If FICE is included on a pro-forma basis from January 1 1993, underlying
sales were 4 per cent higher than a year ago and underlying operating
profits were 25 per cent higher at SKr2.76bn. The group said the main reason
for the improvement was cost-cutting.
The company said its operating margin for the 12 months to June 30 was 16.5
per cent, compared with 14.7 per cent for the whole of last year. It is
looking for savings of SKr1.2bn by 1996 to achieve an operating margin of 20
per cent.
Sales of the group's two main drugs, Genotropin (growth hormones) and Healon
(cataract surgery) both fell slightly. It blamed restrictions on healthcare
spending in Spain and Australia for the 1 per cent decline in Genotropin
sales to SKr1.3bn. Healon sales were also 1 per cent lower at SKr797m due to
fewer surgical operations in the US.
Although sales in the Swedish market fell 7 per cent to SKr967m, sales in
Japan, the group's most important market, rose 15 per cent to SKr2.2bn.
The Swedish government sold most of its shares in Pharmacia in June but has
retained a minority 12 per cent stake to provide the group with ownership
stability ahead of Volvo's planned divestment of its 28 per cent stake in
the company in 1996.
