FT  29 MAR 93 / Labour attacks stores on prices
MR NIGEL Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, has asked the
Office of Fair Trading for an investigation into what he claims is
supermarket 'profiteering'.
In a letter to Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, Mr
Griffiths produces statistics showing that supermarket profits have risen by
422 per cent over 10 years while farm-gate prices have risen by only 18 per
cent.
He contrasts the UK supermarkets' profit increases with those in France.
Carrefour, the largest French supermarket group, increased its profits by
only 76 per cent over the previous 10 years, he points out. According to Mr
Griffiths, gross margins for French supermarkets are around 18 per cent,
compared with 23 per cent for UK market leaders.
