FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): Old ways may
not suit frequent movers - Repayment mortgages may make the process simple,
but the alternative interest-only method can offer greater flexibility /
Buying your house 2, The loan
HOW SHOULD you finance your house purchase? Despite the plethora of products
on offer, the matter can be boiled down to two straightforward decisions.
First: how to pay back the amount borrowed? The choice is broadly between a
repayment or an interest-only mortgage.
Second: now that mortgage rates are historically low, buyers should consider
whether to fix the rate of interest.
PAYING BACK THE MORTGAGE
Lenders offer a variety of ways in which the money can be repaid which rely
on the two constituent parts of the mortgage: the capital sum and the
interest payments on this amount.
Repayment: Until the 1980s, the most popular mortgage was the repayment
type, where the homeowner's monthly payments include both interest and
capital. The advantage is that there is no commission, because
insurance-related products are not involved (although it is prudent to take
out life assurance to cover the mortgage, and most lenders will insist on
this) and the mortgage will be paid off at the end of its term.
The main argument against this method is that you will usually be paying off
more in interest than capital in the early years of the mortgage; so, if you
move frequently, you could find that your payments are mostly interest, with
little progress in paying off the capital.
Another argument is that, since tax relief is available on the first Pounds
30,000 of the loan, it is more tax-efficient to pay interest than make
capital repayments. To get around this problem, the mortgage holder could
try to switch to an interest-only mortgage once the capital sum gets down to
Pounds 30,000. But they have to judge whether they will be better off
getting tax relief on interest payments (restricted solely to 20 per cent
from 1994-95), or making lower interest payments as a result of a smaller
loan.
Interest-only: The alternative to repayment mortgages is the interest-only
mortgage, where you make interest payments on the capital sum throughout the
term of the loan, and have a separate savings plan to pay off the capital
sum at the end of the mortgage term.
The choice of savings methods is wide, though you would not think so judging
by the statistics, which show that endowment mortgages - where a premium is
paid to an insurance company which invests the money on your behalf and
throws in some life assurance - dominate the market.
Sales of endowment mortgages overtook those of the repayment mortgage in the
mid-1980s. At their peak, in 1988, they accounted for 84 per cent of new
mortgages, compared with just 20 per cent in the early 1980s. This
extraordinary growth cannot be entirely separated from the hearty
recommendations of lenders, who earn commission from the life companies for
each policy sold.
But endowments fell to 68 per cent of new mortgage sales in the last quarter
of 1992. Criticism has focused on the high proportion of early redemptions,
which make the policies extremely poor value. Unless you are committed to
holding the endowment for 25 years, it will be better to consider other
savings options.
The most tax-efficient is a pension mortgage, where contributions to a
pension scheme obtain tax relief at the holder's marginal rate and are paid
into a fund which pays no tax. Part of the tax-free lump sum paid on
retirement is used to pay off the mortgage.
The disadvantage is that there will be less left over after paying off the
mortgage to invest for your retirement - an idea which deters many people.
Moreover, if you are too young, you will be making interest payments for
more than 25 years, which can wipe out the tax advantages.
Mortgages linked to personal equity plans (Peps) are a relatively new
innovation. A Pep is free of income and capital gains tax, and is more
flexible than either an endowment or a pension mortgage, because you can
stop making payments into it without penalty and can use it to pay off the
mortgage whenever it grows to the amount needed. The main drawback is that
it is at the mercy of stock market fluctuations, and you have to pay a Pep
manager plan fees, which may reduce or even eliminate the tax benefits.
Some lenders will agree to give you an interest-only loan without tying it
to a particular savings method. You are then free to repay the capital
however you wish, but this is for the disciplined only, or for those who
believe in relying on inflation to erode the value of the capital.
If you move frequently, interest-only mortgages can be less cumbersome than
a repayment mortgage, because they do not have to be redeemed each time.
TO FIX OR NOT TO FIX?
With mortgage rates at a 20-year low, it is not surprising that so many
people have flocked to fix their mortgage, in order to have the security of
knowing what their monthly payments will be. Lenders have signalled that a
further one point cut in base rates will only be mirrored by a fractional
drop in mortgage rates, so these appear to be at or near the bottom.
You will have to pay a booking or administration fee, likely to be about
Pounds 200-Pounds 300, and you should watch out for product tie-ins. There
will also be early redemption penalties - the fee for early repayment of
part or all of the loan.
Choosing a short-term fix of, say, three years or less, leaves you exposed
to the risk that the fix ends just as interest rates rise again. But
longer-term fixed-rate offers are higher than the standard variable rate of
7.99 per cent that prevailed last month.
For example, Lloyds bank this year launched a 25-year fixed rate of 9.75 per
cent (on endowment or pension mortgages only). How good or bad a deal it is
depends on what interest rates end up doing over the period - but some
borrowers may be willing to pay a little more in order to have certainty.
