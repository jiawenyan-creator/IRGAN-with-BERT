P.M. BRIEFING; 
THREAT SEEN TO U.S. CAR INDUSTRY 
Rep. Marcy Kaptur, an advocate of better access for U.S. goods in other 
countries, said today the number of imported cars sold here threatens the 
existence of the domestic auto industry and its suppliers. 
The Ohio Democrat said it is essential for the industry's survival that U.S. 
auto suppliers receive more business with foreign car manufacturers because 
Japan already controls one-third of the domestic new car market. 
Kaptur admitted the United States is in a weak position to demand better 
access, however, because of Japan's support and involvement in the U.S. 
financial markets. 
She also acknowledged that those circumstances made it difficult to use trade 
sanctions against Japan to force open those markets. 
"I am someone who believes that access to our marketplace should be used as a 
tool in order to get access to other people's marketplace," Kaptur said. "There 
should be reciprocity certainly between the United States and Japan."
