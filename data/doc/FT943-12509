FT  25 JUL 94 / Arts: Today's Television
In 1991 a young British photographer, Paul Jenks, was killed by a sniper in
Croatia. Two of his friends believe that there was more to his death than a
chance sniper's bullet and they return there to seek some answers. This is a
promising start to a series of Travels with my camera in which writers go
after the stories armed with nothing more than a simple Hi-8 camera (Channel
4 at 9pm).
It seems that everything is being forced into the game show format. Last
week it was pets in 'Pets Win Prizes', in which chickens, tortoises and
ferrets strove for glory. Tonight it is the countryside in The Big Country
Quest, (BBC 1 at 7.30) in which townies are made fun of as they try to
master such rural crafts as goat milking and duck herding. Its an idea
culled from 'The Generation Game' and fits nicely into a lack-lustre
evening, with the only likely diversions the light hearted Frank Stubbs (ITV
at 9pm) and the repeat of The Singing Detective (BBC 1 at 10.10), part of
the tribute to the late Dennis Potter. On second showing it is perversely
arty, but when the film dissolves into song and dance the impact is still
tremendous.
