GUARD HELD IN TORRANCE SLAYING WAS ON PAROLE 
A former security guard arrested this week in the murder of a woman in a 
Torrance townhouse complex was on parole for a felony assault conviction at the 
time he was hired to patrol the gated complex where the victim lived, state 
officials said. 
Keith Brian Campbell was released from Folsom State Prison in November, 1988, 
after serving four years of a seven-year sentence for assault with a deadly 
weapon. He was working for Transworld Security Systems at the Park Del Amo 
development in Torrance on May 31 when he allegedly strangled Tracy Morrigan, 
26, police said. The security firm and Watt Homes Inc., which built Park Del 
Amo, did not respond to requests for comment.
