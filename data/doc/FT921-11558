FT  31 JAN 92 / Standard of education criticised by inspectors
THE STANDARD of education of more than a quarter of pupils in England is
unsatisfactory, the government's independent education watchdog said
yesterday.
In his annual report for 1990-91 Dr Terry Melia, the senior chief inspector
of schools, said that 30 per cent of primary school work inspected was less
than satisfactory. For secondary school work of pupils aged between 11 and
16, the figure was 27 per cent.
In further and higher education, around 90 per cent of work inspected was
satisfactory or better.
The report was based on observations of more than 50,000 lessons on visits
to 7,000 schools and colleges.
The report is especially critical of persistent underachievement by some
schools in inner-city areas. More than a third of the work observed in these
was unsatisfactory.
The inspectors found a wide range of standards in independent schools. Some
achieved the highest standards found in the country. Others offered an
'unacceptably poor provision'.
