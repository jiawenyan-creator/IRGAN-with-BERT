FT  28 NOV 92 / Bankers seek Lamont meeting
THE British Bankers' Association yesterday asked for a meeting with Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, about recent criticism of banks' lending
policies, John Gapper writes. Sir Nicholas Goodison, association president,
said an inquiry into lending policies by the Bank of England last year had
shown criticisms to be 'largely unjustified'.
The association said it was waiting for bank chairmen to be contacted by Mr
Lamont after he had indicated to the Commons trade and industry committee 10
days ago that he wanted to discuss lending policies with them.
The association's letter marks an attempt by the banks to defend themselves
energetically against charges of making excessive profits from small
businesses.
