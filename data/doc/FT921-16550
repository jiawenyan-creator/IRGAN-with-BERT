FT  02 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Backing bonds
This is the context in which investors have to address a pressing strategic
problem: the attractions of bonds versus equities. In the 1990s, the UK and
a number of other economies may be facing a change in the terms of the
trade-off between inflation and growth. If inflation is to be conquered -
which is scarcely guaranteed - so much the better for bonds. If the price is
a lower growth rate, so much the worse for equities.
The trouble is that, historically, equities have outperformed bonds by a
wide margin in all but the most extreme conditions. According to the BZW
Equity-Gilt Study, the total real return on gilts in the depression decade
starting in January 1929 averaged 6.7 per cent a year against 5.2 per cent
on UK equities. But very few investors, however bearish, expect output to be
hammered in the 1990s as it was in the 1930s. A better parallel with life in
the ERM might be the decade up to the UK devaluation of 1967, under the
Bretton Woods system. In that period, UK growth and inflation both averaged
around 3 per cent. The average real return on gilts was 0.9 per cent, on
equities 11.6 per cent.
The persistent tendency of fixed interest securities to perform worse than
equities is something of a puzzle. The BZW series goes back to 1919 for the
UK and 1926 for the US. In that time, the total annual return on equities
has been 8-9 percentage points higher than that on Treasury bills in both
markets. To say that investors have blindly overpaid for bonds throughout is
to argue for market inefficiency on a heroic scale. But neither is it quite
satisfactory to explain the difference in terms of risk. In the UK market,
the dominant holders of equities are institutions who diversify the risk of
any given share across their portfolio. If Asda does badly, so much the
better for their holdings in Tesco and Sainsbury.
