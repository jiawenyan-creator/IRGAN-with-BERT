  [Text] Paris March 21 TASS -- One of the important things 
that should be introduced in relations between CIS states is the 
conviction that all of them are genuinely independent countries, 
Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin said. 
  Speaking to journalists from the French-Russian press 
association in Paris on Monday, Adamishin said that Russia 
considers relations with CIS states as the most important aspect 
of its foreign policy. He called for closer economic integration 
of CIS countries on a volunteer basis and with the preservation 
of their political independence. 
  If Moscow wanted to retain them under its influence by 
force, 
this would be imperialism. But Russia has neither such 
intentions, nor force. Therefore it is tactless to accuse it of 
pursuing an imperialistic policy, the diplomat said. 
  On the contrary, it wants all CIS states to unite 
economically within the framework of economic integration, he 
added. 
  Speaking about Russian-Ukrainian relations, Adamishin 
pointed 
out that Russia is interested in an integral, economically 
strong and politically balanced Ukraine. There are perhaps some 
people who believe that the worse it is in Ukraine, the better 
for Russia. But this is a very short-sighted approach, he 
continued. If Ukraine slides into social upheavals, an economic 
crisis and disintegration, this will have extremely grave 
consequences for Russia too. "We will try to avoid this by all 
means," he said. 
  Russia is making no territorial claims on Ukraine. The 
Crimea should remain within Ukraine. They should settle their 
relations on the basis of bilateral agreements and the 
constitutions. But human rights should be respected in the 
Crimea as much as anywhere else, the diplomat said. 
  "We are for close economic ties between the Crimea and 
various Russian regions," Adamishin noted.
