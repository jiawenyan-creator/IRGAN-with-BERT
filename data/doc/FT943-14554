FT  14 JUL 94 / Tebbit fires salvo for disabled
Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative party chairman, yesterday criticised
hoteliers for not doing enough to help disabled guests and warned the
industry to take action to reduce pressure for legislation.
He said at the annual lunch of the British Hospitality Association, which
represents hoteliers, restaurateurs and caterers: 'When as hoteliers you
order new tables for dining rooms, does anyone say: 'Would the knees of
someone in a wheelchair fit under that table?' '
Lord Tebbit said his wife would not forgive him if he did not raise the
issue. Lady Tebbit was disabled by the IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in
Brighton during the Tory party conference in 1984.
Lord Tebbit said proposals in the recent backbench bill on the rights of the
disabled, which was defeated in May, were 'quite absurd' and would have
imposed unjustifiable costs on organisations such as London Underground.
But he told the association's members that support for the bill had been
increased by a perception that the interests of the disabled had been
ignored.
He added that the tourist industry had to do more to protect the environment
on which it depended for its success.
One step the association could take would be to campaign for someone to take
overall responsibility for the movement of London traffic. When he had asked
who was responsible for traffic in the capital he had been given a 'list as
long as my arm'.
