FT  02 DEC 92 / Whitehall unions discuss links
TALKS have started between two of the largest Civil Service unions about
closer co-operation that might lead to a merger.
The leaders of the 50,000-strong Inland Revenue Staff Federation and
100,000-strong National Union of Civil and Public Servants insist that the
talks are not formal merger discussions.
The core membership of the NUCPS is in Customs and Excise and, combined with
the Inland Revenue employees, a merged union would cover almost all
government revenues. The biggest obstacle is that the Inland Revenue would
not approve of it and might de-recognise a combined union.
The two unions have different political traditions. The IRSF has a moderate
leadership and the NUCPS has, until recently, been dominated by left-wing
Labour and Communist sympathisers.
NUCPS, unlike the IRSF, has been losing members heavily and is carrying a
large deficit.
All Civil Service unions face upheaval because of the contracting out of
government work and devolution of pay bargaining. Mr Clive Brooke, IRSF
leader, yesterday predicted that within five years all Civil Service unions
would be in a single federation.
A federation in which unions retain their independence but share certain
functions such as research and media relations was launched yesterday by the
IPMS Civil Service union, the CMA postal managers union and the STE telecom
managers union.
