SUMMARY: 

As directed in the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993, the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress adopted
the rules and regulations of the Tribunal that were found in 37 CFR chapter III on an interim basis with only technical
changes. It later issued revised rules and regulations. The Office failed to amend one of the existing Copyright Office
regulations and also erred in several sections of the revised interim regulations. The Office is making only technical
changes to correct those errors.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On December 17, 1993, the President signed into law the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993 (Reform Act).
Pub. L. No. 103198. Effective immediately upon enactment, the Reform Act amended the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.,
by eliminating the Copyright Royalty Tribunal and transferring its responsibilities and duties to ad hoc copyright
royalty panels, to be administered by the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office. The copyright royalty panels
will be convened by the Librarian of Congress for limited times for the purpose of adjusting rates and distributing
royalties collected under the compulsory licenses of the Copyright Code. 

See 

17 U.S.C. 111, 115, 118, 119, and Chapter 10.



The Reform Act eliminated the Copyright Royalty Tribunal and directed the Librarian of Congress to adopt immediately
the rules and regulations of the Tribunal in their entirety. We adopted the Tribunal's regulations with certain technical
amendments as interim regulations on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67690). In one part of these interim regulations we changed
the terms ``Copyright Royalty Tribunal'' and ``Tribunal'' wherever they appeared to ``copyright arbitration royalty
panels and/or Librarian of Congress''. We did not change any references to the Tribunal in our own regulations at that
time.
On May 9, 1994, we issued interim regulations in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 23964) amending the interim regulations we had adopted on December 22, 1993. In the amended regulations of May
9, 1994, we made errors in 253.8(e); 255.3(g)(1); 259.1; 259.2, 259.3(d)(e)(f); and 259.4(a)(b)(d).
In the December 22, 1993, amendments, we had changed the designations ``Copyright Royalty Tribunal'' and ``Tribunal''
to ``copyright arbitration royalty panels and/or Librarian of Congress''. We failed to recognize all of these changes
when we revised the interim regulation on May 22, 1994, and inserted ``Copyright Office'' in some sections. However,
instead of amending the existing terms ``copyright arbitration royalty panel and/or Librarian of Congress'' we
made these amendments to the already deleted terms ``Copyright Royalty Tribunal'' and ``Tribunal'' or ``CRT''.
This document will correct the errors found in the May 9, 1994, document.
Also, we did not earlier amend 201.16 (a) and (b)(3)(iii) of our regulations to add ``the former'' in front of
Copyright Royalty Tribunal in 201.16(a) and change ``Copyright Royalty Tribunal'' to ``copyright arbitration
royalty panels and/or Librarian of Congress'' in 201.16(b)(3)(iii). This rule is issued as a final rule for
201.16 (a) and (b)(3)(iii) and a correction of the document of May 9, 1994.
