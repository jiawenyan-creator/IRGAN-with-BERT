SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: RUNNING 
The Del Mar city council gave organizers of the San Diego Marathon two weeks to 
devise a suitable traffic-control plan, thus breathing life into a race which 
last week appeared doomed when city managers of three cities denied it 
special-use permits. 
If organizers can find a solution to a Sherriff's manpower shortage and can 
allow for residents West of Old Highway 101 -- over which the race will be run 
on Dec. 9 -- to get around runners, then the council will overturn the city 
manager's decision, according to Lynn Flanagan, race director. 
If Del Mar reverses its city manager's decision, Flanagan hopes the councils of 
Solana Beach and Encinitas will do the same. The three cities contract for 
service through the same Sherriff's substation in Encinitas. JOHN GEIS
