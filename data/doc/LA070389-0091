LOCAL; 
ABORTION FOES IN ORANGE COUNTY CELEBRATE SUPREME COURT RULING 
As did their colleagues across the nation, anti-abortion activists in Orange 
County exulted today over the U.S. Supreme Court's decision imposing tough new 
restrictions on a woman's right to the procedure. 
"We're pleased to see the court has taken a significant step toward the 
protection of women from exploitation and their children from murder," said 
Russell Neal, an Orange County spokesman for Southern California Operation 
Rescue. 
Although the court's decision on a Missouri case is not expected to have any 
immediate effect locally, pro-choice advocates in the county lambasted the 
verdict, calling it the first salvo in what promises to be a prolonged war over 
the issue. 
"It means we need to press our point a little harder, a little more vocally," 
said Margie Fites Seigle, executive director of Planned Parenthood of Orange 
and San Bernardino Counties. "We will do that by encouraging pro-choice persons 
to write to their legislators to let them know that reproductive rights should 
remain a choice for all women in California."
