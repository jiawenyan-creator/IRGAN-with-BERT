FT  03 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): No let-up in region's
record-breaking run
SHARE prices edged down on position squaring ahead of today's national
holiday and the Nikkei average ended marginally lower on arbitrage-related
selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index lost 57.00 at 19,381.24 after registering a day's low of
19,342.03 and high of 19,549.15. The focus of attention was once again East
Japan Railway, which finished Y3,000 firmer at Y495,000, after moving
between Y491,000 and Y501,000.
Volume remained low, at 210m shares against 197m, and falls led rises by 518
to 438, with 199 issues unchanged, although the Topix index of all first
section stocks put on 2.12 at 1,621.87. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
gained 1.13 at 1,288.99.
The market remained generally resilient to news of the financial crisis at
Muramoto Construction, an unlisted contractor, which filed for court
protection on Monday with debts of Y590bn.
Daiwa Bank, Muramoto Construction's leading creditor, declined Y50 to
Y1,180. However, elsewhere in the banking sector, Sakura Bank rose Y10 to
Y1,700 and Fuji Bank Y20 to Y2,360. Real estate and construction companies
were also lower, with Mitsui Fudosan down Y20 to Y1,290, Shimizu falling Y15
to Y853 and Sato Kogyo off Y10 at Y760.
Sumitomo Metal Mining retreated Y6 to Y830 after weak interim earnings on
Monday, and as margin traders, who had bought the stock six months earlier
on rising gold prices, liquidated holdings.
The rise in JR East helped other railway issues, Seibu Railway improving
Y150 to Y3,900.
Consumer electronics stocks were higher on bargain hunting. Matsushita
Electric Industrial firmed Y10 to Y1,470 and Sony Y10 to Y4,970. Toyota
Motor, which rose on foreign buying on Monday, shed Y30 to Y1,870 on
profit-taking.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 21.34 to 21,489.77 in volume of 12m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets continued their record-setting ways. Manila was closed.
HONG KONG again set a record closing peak, although late profit-taking had
wiped out much of the day's gain. The Hang Seng index was finally 13.72
ahead at 9,642.91, after reaching 9,716.38.
Profit-takers began the day by dragging the index down 68 points before
major buyers regained the upper hand, although buying slowed as the index
topped the 9,700 level.
Second and third liners led the active list: they were sought by retail
investors who have been trying to avoid expensive blue chips.
SINGAPORE picked up late in the day, taking the Straits Times Industrial
index 18.17 higher to a record 2,123.85. The newly listed Singapore Telecom
eased 14 cents to SDollars 4.00.
BANGKOK added another 2.4 per cent, with the banking sector selected by
investors. The SET index rose 31.59 to 1,357.75 in turnover of Bt26.7bn.
Among the actives, Thai Farmers Bank gained Bt7 at Bt117 and Bangkok Bank
Bt10 at Bt182.
NEW ZEALAND remained firm following good half-year results from Telecom,
which rose to an all-time high of NZDollars 4.69 immediately after the
announcement, but then fell back to NZDollars 4.57, down 3 cents on the day.
The NZSE-40 index closed at a four-year peak of 2,203.09, up 3.59 points, in
turnover of NZDollars 56.7m.
AUSTRALIA retreated for the first time since October 25, with the All
Ordinaries index losing 7.1 to 2,125.3. Turnover was ADollars 337.05m. A
weaker bullion price contributed to the change of sentiment and the golds
index fell 36.0 to 2,173.6.
Foster's Brewing, the day's most active stock, added 6 cents at ADollars
1.54, while BHP lost 6 cents to ADollars 17.80 and Western Mining 10 cents
to ADollars 5.46.
KUALA LUMPUR closed higher but trading was subdued due to investor caution
and trading restrictions by some stockbroking firms. The composite index
advanced 5.31 to 972.36.
Malaysian Airline System gained MDollars 1.30 at MDollars 7.55 amid
speculation that the government planned to place shares it holds in the
group. Malaysian International Shipping, in which the government also has a
stake, rose 55 cents to MDollars 7.20.
SEOUL finished lower as sales by institutions of issues with low
price-to-book ratios won a tug-of-war with buyers of blue chips in the
manufacturing sector. The composite index shed 2.34 to 759.42 in turnover of
Won941.48bn.
