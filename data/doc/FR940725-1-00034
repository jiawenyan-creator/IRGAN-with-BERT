Section 222(a) provides for a ``floating minimum'' for the allocation of formula grants to States and Territories
that is tied to the total appropriation level for Title II in a given fiscal year. For Fiscal Year 1993, the total appropriation
for Title II of the JJDP Act (other than Parts D and E) was less than $75 million. As a result, the ``floating minimum''
formula grant allocation for any State was legislatively established at a minimum of $325,000 and a maximum of $400,000
for States, and $75,000 and $100,000 for Territories, with no State or Territory receiving less than its Fiscal Year
1992 allocation. The Congressionally stated purpose of this formula was to increase the funds available to the minimum
allocation States and Territories. In order to ensure that this Congressional intent is maximized, the Fiscal Year
1993 formula grant allocations held the non-minimum States and Territories at their Fiscal Year 1992 funding levels,
allocating the increased Fiscal Year 1993 formula grant funds to the minimum States and Territories on a prorata basis.

For Fiscal Year 1994, the total appropriation for Title II (other than Part D) exceeds the $75 million threshold. Consequently,
the ``floating minimum'' formula grant allocation for any State in Fiscal Year 1994 is established at a minimum of
$400,000 and a maximum of $600,000. OJJDP proposes to implement the amended language in Section 222(a)(2)(B) to provide
for a minimum allocation of $600,000, based on fund availability: ``*** not less than $400,000, or
such greater amount, up to $600,000, as is available to be allocated ***'' All non-minimum States
will also receive an increased formula grant allocation in Fiscal Year 1994. 
Proposed State formula grant allocations for Fiscal Years 1993 and 1994 have been provided to all States and Territories.
The precise procedure used by the budget staff of the Office of Justice Programs to calculate State formula grant allocations
is available upon request. 


Collocated Juvenile and Adult Facilities 


Section 223(a)(14) of the JJDP Act requires that juveniles be removed from adult jails and lockups. OJJDP policy No.
911401, July 16, 1991, sought to clarify the existing OJJDP regulatory requirements for establishing the
existence of a separate juvenile detention facility where such facility is located in the same building or on the same
grounds as an adult jail or lockup. 
OJJDP's initial policy on collocated juvenile and adult facilities was established by an OJJDP ``Position Statement
on Minimum Requirements of Section 223(a)(14) of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, as amended,''
which was published as a Notice in the 

Federal Register

 on January 17, 1984. Four criteria were established in that policy publication, each of which had to be met to ensure
the requisite separateness of juvenile and adult facilities. The criteria were subsequently incorporated into
the Formula Grants regulation the following year (See 50 FR 119, 2555025561, June 20, 1985). The July 16, 1991
OJJDP policy reiterated each of the four criteria, and sought to clarify a number of specific implementation mechanisms
that would be acceptable to OJJDP while remaining within the parameters of each criterion. 
The clarifications in OJJDP Policy No. 911401 have been the subject of continued concern and controversy in
the juvenile justice community. In addition, the 1992 Amendments substantially revise one of the four criteria (separate
staff) for determining whether a separate juvenile detention facility exists. For these reasons, the Administrator
deems it essential to provide interested parties with an opportunity to comment on each of the four collocated facility
criteria.
