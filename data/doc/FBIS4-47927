  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali has proposed the 
withdrawal of 2,000 UN soldiers in Mozambique by May. In a 
report on UN Operations in Mozambique, Unomoz, Butrus-Ghali 
says, however, other reductions before October elections are not 
convenient. In its last resolution on Mozambique, the Security 
Council requested the UN secretary general to present proposals 
for the gradual withdrawal of the soldiers. About 800 Italian 
soldiers who were stationed in the Beira Corridor left 
Mozambique in April, and about 200 others are still in the 
country.
