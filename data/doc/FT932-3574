FT  14 JUN 93 / Imposed deal for Ulster is ruled out
SIR PATRICK Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday ruled out any
attempt by Britain to force a new system of government on the province - in
spite of the refusal of Unionist politicians to join fresh 'round-table'
talks, Ralph Atkins writes.
Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, are to meet
on Wednesday as part of the twice-yearly meetings between the two intended
to improve relations between the countries.
But Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two main Unionist
leaders, have hardened their opposition to talks. Mr Molyneaux said past
political initiatives had increased uncertainty in the province, putting
people's lives at risks. He opposed 'these circus operations for
international consumption'.
On BBC Television Sir Patrick reaffirmed his commitment to finding agreement
between nationalist and unionist communities.
