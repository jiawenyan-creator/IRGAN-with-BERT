 

(1) Registering for PACS employment is a requirement for consummation of their early retirement under section 4403
of Public Law 102484 or section 561 of Public Law 103160.

(2) Early retirees must provide a copy of their confirmation DORS mini-resume to their servicing military personnel

(3) Subsequent PACS employment is encouraged but not required.

(4) Working in a DoD-approved Federal public service organization may subject him or her to dual compensation restrictions
of 5 U.S.C. 5532.

(5) DoD-approved PACS employment qualifies the Service member who is retired under section 4403 of Public Law 102484
or section 561 of Public Law 103160 for increased retired pay effective on the first day of the first month beginning
after the date on which the member or former member attains 62 years of age. The former Service member must have worked
in DoD-approved PACS employment between the date of early retirement and the date in which he or she would have attained
20 years of creditable service for computing retired pay, and have retired on or after October 23, 1992 and before October
1, 1999.

(6) It is the early retiree's responsibility to ensure that the DMDC is advised when the early retiree's PACS employment
starts, and of any subsequent changes.

(d) Military personnel offices shall ensure a copy of the confirmation DORS mini-resume is filed in the permanent
document section of the Service record of Service members who retire early.

(e) DMDC shall maintain the PACS Personnel Registry, which includes information on the particular job skills, qualifications,
and experience of registered personnel.

(f) DMDC shall maintain the PACS Organizational Registry, which includes information regarding each organization,
including its location, size, types of public or community service positions in the organization, points of contact,
procedures for applying for such positions, and a description of each position that is likely to be available.

(g) PACS Organizations shall use DD Form 2581 (appendix B of this part) and DD Form 25811 (appendix C of this part)
to request registration on the PACS Organizational Registry. Instructions on how to complete the forms and where
to send them are on the forms.

(h) DMDC shall register those organizations meeting the definition of a PACS organization and include them on the
PACS Organizational Registry. For organizations that do not appear to meet the criteria, DMDC shall refer the request
to the Transition Support and Services Directorate, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Personnel and
Readiness. The Transition Support and Services Directorate may consult individually on an ad hoc basis with appropriate
agencies to determine whether or not the organization meets the validation criteria. For organizations which are
denied approval as a creditable early retirement organization and which request reconsideration, the Transition
Support and Services Directorate will forward that request to the next higher level for a final determination. DMDC
shall advise organizations of their status.
