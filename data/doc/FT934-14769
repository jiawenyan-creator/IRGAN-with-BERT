FT  15 OCT 93 / Kurdish violence forces Mobil to halt its operations
MOBIL Oil of the US has suspended operations in Turkey's south-east region
after a series of violent attacks and attempts at extortion by the rebel
Kurdish Workers' party (PKK).
The decision, which follows the kidnapping in August of seven local staff,
underlines the growing instability in the Kurdish-speaking area, where the
PKK is fighting a violent campaign for independence. The men were
subsequently released.
Mobil said it was no longer prepared to put its employees at risk and would
not meet the extortion demands by the PKK.
The latest incident, on a rig near the refinery town of Batman, followed
four earlier attacks. In one incident, three Mobil engineers were singled
out and shot by rebels of the PKK. 'It is clear that it is Mobil the company
that is now under active threat,' said Mr Roy Johnson, Mobil's production
manager for Turkey.
Turkey's domestic production, although still small, accounts for around 20
per cent of its crude needs, according to industry sources.
The Kurdish region is by the far the most important production region, with
TPAO, the state oil exploration company, producing around 56,000 barrels a
day. The other main producer, with around 14,000 b/d, is Shell, the UK-Dutch
oil major. Company officials say Shell's rig near Batman has been attacked
twice in the last year.
