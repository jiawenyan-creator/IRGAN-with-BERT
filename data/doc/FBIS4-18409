<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Instigation Against Jews"] </F>
  [Text] According to information obtained by the North 
Rhine-Westphalian Office for the Protection of the Constitution, 
the anti-Semitic attacks by Republikaner Chairman Franz 
Schoenhuber against Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central 
Council of Jews in Germany, are part of a systematic campaign. 
Fritz-Achim Baumann, chief of the North Rhine-Westphalian 
Office for the Protection of the Constitution, said that the 
Republikaner are relying on anti-Semitic instigation because, as 
a result of the tightening of the asylum law, the issue of 
foreigners' policy can no longer be used to polarize the 
population, in the view of the right-wing extremists. 
Constitutional Protection knows of so-called sample speeches, 
which "have obviously been formulated by the party's Executive 
Committee." In these speeches representatives of the Jewish 
communities are denounced as "chief German haters." One of 
these sample speeches says that Chancellor Helmut Kohl "put on 
the cap to satisfy Mr. Galinski." Heinz Galinski was Bubis' 
predecessor as chairman of the Central Council of Jews in 
Germany.
