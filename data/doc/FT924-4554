FT  02 DEC 92 / Europe's executives expect gloomy year ahead
LEADING European companies forecast a gloomy new year of low growth and
rising inflation and unemployment, according to a survey of business opinion
in the seven biggest European Community economies published today.
Only 38 per cent of leading European business executives believe their
company's prospects will improve during the next 12 months, while 19 per
cent think the position will worsen.
The survey - the UPS Business Monitor - was conducted for the US-based
delivery company United Parcel Service by Harris Research. Interviews were
carried out in seven countries - Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, Spain and the UK - after Europe's September currency upheavals.
The findings show how concern over flagging economic dynamism and the
faltering pace of European integration has forced companies to lower their
sights for 1993.
There has been a sharp rise in pessimism since the spring. When surveyed in
February and March, 55 per cent of business leaders thought their company
would do better during the coming 12 months, and only 6 per cent believed
the position would get worse.
This means that the 'optimism index' (the gap between optimistic executives
and pessimistic ones) fell from 49 points in March to 19 in the autumn.
Business chiefs across the continent foresee a small increase in inflation
next year in all countries except the Netherlands. Unemployment is expected
to rise by 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points in most countries, while no country
is thought likely to experience growth of more than 1.9 per cent.
Companies in Spain, the UK, Italy and Germany all forecast growth of 1.2 per
cent or less in their countries' economies next year. Companies in the
Netherlands and France are slightly more optimistic, expecting expansion of
1.9 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively.
Executives in Germany are most gloomy about next year's prospects, with 22
per cent saying their company's position will improve in the next year, and
33 per cent forecasting deterioration. There has been a striking decline in
German optimism since March, when 36 per cent saw an improvement against
only 11 per cent forecasting deterioration.
In spite of the restrained outlook for British growth, UK executives are
most optimistic about an upturn in prospects, reflecting the view that the
two-year recession in the UK may be about to end. Of British executives
surveyed, 60 per cent said they thought their companies would do better
during the next 12 months, while only 8 per cent said they would fare worse.
However, this relative confidence marked a decline in optimism since March,
when 74 per cent foresaw improvement and only 4 per cent deterioration.
Across the other EC countries, business confidence has also registered a
steep fall since March. The 'optimism index' fell from 39 to 6 in Belgium,
from 57 to 25 in Spain, from 49 to 14 in France, from 51 to 19 in Italy and
from 39 to 17 in the Netherlands.
Although German companies are the most pessimistic about the next 12 months'
prospects, the medium-term outlook is seen as much brighter - particularly
by respondents outside Germany. Seventy-one per cent of companies tipped
Germany as likely to show strongest growth during the next three years,
while 48 per cent believed France would be in this position, putting it in
second place behind Spain. There was virtually unanimous belief (among 91
per cent of respondents) that Germany can overcome the challenges of
reunification.
The UK businessmen display much more confidence in British prospects than do
their competitors abroad. Among UK respondents, 33 per cent expect Britain
to show strongest economic growth during the next three years, while only 12
per cent of their counterparts on the continent agree.
Italy is expected to show weakest economic growth during the next three
years, according to 51 per cent of all respondents, and 54 per cent of
Italian business people.
The UK came second among the countries judged to face poorest growth
prospects, ranked in this position by 48 per cent of all respondents, but by
only 30 per cent of the British.
One factor underlying optimism among businessmen is the advent of the single
market. European companies hope to benefit as the single market comes into
effect next year, in spite of doubts about ratification of the Maastricht
treaty.
However, 45 per cent of respondents forecast that customs procedures and
controls at borders will not disappear in 1993. Although this indicates that
hopes about the precise impact of next year's changes have been scaled down,
a large majority (67 per cent to 21 per cent) believes that movement of
goods within the EC next year will become easier.
Support for the single market is uniformly strong among the countries
surveyed, but there is scepticism about whether single market directives are
being implemented equally in all member states. Italy is viewed as the worst
offender.
