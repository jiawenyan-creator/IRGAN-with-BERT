<DOCTITLE>Polestar Capital, Inc.; Issuance of a Small Business Investment Company License</DOCTITLE>



On March 23, 1994, a notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 13755) stating that an application has been filed by Polestar Capital, Inc., 200 Randolph Drive, Chicago, Illinois
60601, with the Small Business Administration (SBA) pursuant to Section 107.102 of the Regulations governing small
business investment companies (13 CFR 107.102 (1994)) for a Transfer of Ownership and Control and Capital Reorganization
of Amoco Venture Capital Company.

Interested parties were given until close of business April 22, 1994 to submit their comments to SBA. No comments were
received. 

Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, after
having considered the application and all other pertinent information, SBA has approved the Transfer of Ownership
and Control and Capital Reorganization of Polestar Capital, Inc., under the following terms and conditions, effective
April 29, 1994.

(1) At this time, subject to number two (2) below and current regulations, your application does not address the 3 percent
Preferred Stock Buy Back Program or the Preferential Payment Distribution to Amoco Corporation (``AMOCO'').

(2) No distributions, including the Preferential Payment Distribution, could be made to any shareholder or Amoco
without full repayment of the accrued dividends outstanding owed to the Small Business Administration (``SBA'')
for your outstanding 3 percent Preferred Stock. Provided that Polestar Capital, Inc. (``PCI'') is in compliance
with SBA regulations, after the payment of the accrued but unpaid dividends owed to SBA, then PCI could make distributions
to other shareholders and to Amoco as long as PCI had the ability to make additional distributions in compliance with
all SBA regulations.

(3) Once the final regulations were completed for the Preferred Stock Buy Back, PCI would be eligible to apply under
the then current existing regulations. PCI could not request terms or conditions that were utilized in the pilot program,
if such conditions have been changed for the final program. Amoco Corporation has indicated that they do not desire
and would not apply for the 3 percent Preferred Stock Buy Back Program prior to the actual change of ownership and control.
For the purposes of the 3 percent Preferred Stock Buy Back, PCI would agree that it could not claim distressed status
under the Buy Back regulations.

(4) Any future sale or conversion of a controlling interest (50 percent or more of the common stock) of the common stock
of PCI would continue to be subordinated to the accrued but unpaid interest and principal of the Small Business Administration's
(``SBA'') outstanding 3 percent Preferred Stock, and would require under existing regulation SBA's prior approval.
