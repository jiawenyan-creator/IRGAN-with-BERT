FT  12 JAN 94 / Slaughters tops list of takeover legal advisers
Slaughter and May, a City of London firm of solicitors, was the leading
legal adviser to those involved in UK public takeovers last year, it was
disclosed yesterday.
The firm advised companies or financial advisers in 13 deals worth Pounds
1.78bn according to Acquisitions Monthly magazine, which ranks law firms by
the value of the takeovers in which they acted as advisers.
Slaughters' position in the league follows its involvement as adviser to
merchant banks in a number of media deals.
The firm advised Hambros on Carlton Communications' Pounds 758m offer for
Central Independent Television. It was also involved in the Pounds 99m sale
of Thames Television to Pearson and is now involved in helping London
Weekend Television fight off Granada's Pounds 600m bid.
Herbert Smith was ranked second for its involvement in 15 deals worth Pounds
1.48bn. The firm acted for Central on the Carlton deal and for Owners Abroad
in its successful defence against the Pounds 283m hostile takeover bid from
rival operator Airtours.
Clifford Chance was placed third with six transactions worth Pounds 1.32bn.
The firm's good showing is partly to its involvement in Carlton's bid for
Central and the Pounds 242m Whitbread-Whitbread Investment deal.
Takeover activity remained depressed during 1993. The 20 most active UK law
firms acting for companies as opposed to financial advisers were involved in
91 UK public takeovers with a combined value of only Pounds 6.5bn compared
with 92 deals worth Pounds 23bn in 1992.
These figures illustrate the dramatic decline in UK public takeovers since
the mergers-and-acquisitions boom of the late 1980s. In 1989 the top 20 law
firms were involved in 263 deals worth Pounds 137bn.
Lawyers seem confident that the climate is right for an upturn in mergers
and acquisitions during 1994, but they warn that companies are much more
cautious than they used to be and that there still appears to be little
appetite among institutional investors to back significant acquisitions
strategies.
