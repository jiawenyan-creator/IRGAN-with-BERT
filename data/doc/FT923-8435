FT  11 AUG 92 / Observer: Right move?
Is Stephen Mulholland, the abrasive managing director of Times Media (TML),
the South African media group, about to follow in the footsteps of the late
tycoon Robert Holmes a Court and cricketer Tony Greig and try and make his
mark in Australia?
Speculation is rife that he is about to take off round the world to head the
Fairfax publishing empire in Australia. Although he has acknowledged that he
has been approached by 'an Australian publisher', he said he was happy in
South Africa. He has, however, sold out of TML where he was previously the
largest individual shareholder.
Mulholland would be in his element in the land of plain speaking. A robust,
self-made man with outspoken free-market views, he is notorious for his
short temper and a manner abrupt to the point of rudeness. Some who have
worked for him regard him as a crude bully; others have been stimulated by
his no-nonsense, can-do attitude.
The former editor of the weekly Financial Mail was promoted in 1986 to try
to rescue TML's stricken predecessor, South African Associated Newspapers
(SAAN), which had been bled dry by losses incurred at the Rand Daily Mail
and the Sunday Express, both closed in 1985. He succeeded immediately and
the group has made handsome profits.
While shareholders may approve of his tenure, journalists are more
sceptical. Many equate Mulholland with the triumph of profit over principle
and hold him responsible for a general retreat from the liberal ideals
upheld by the Mail and the Express.
Sounds just the man for the job. Funny it's taking so long to appoint him.
