FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Ascii to receive Y16bn in fresh
loans
ASCII, the Japanese software and publishing company, has reached final
agreement with its banks that will lead to Y16.4bn (Dollars 133m) in fresh
loans to the company.
Yesterday's announcement removes a cloud from the company's future. Ascii
has been negotiating with its banks since late last year to raise funds to
repay Y12bn in convertible bonds due at the end of the financial year.
In addition to funds to repay the bonds, Ascii has raised Y4.4bn in working
and investment capital, of which Y3.5bn has been paid to the company.
Its bankers, which include the Industrial Bank of Japan, Fuji Bank, Sakura
Bank, Yasuda Trust Bank, Kyowa Saitama Bank and Mitsubishi Bank, have,
however, evidently extracted promises from the company to cut costs and trim
loss-making operations. The company said yesterday this would not affect its
film-making subsidiary.
Ascii was founded by three university students in 1978 and has grown quickly
into Japan's largest independent software house, but its financial troubles
appear to have stemmed diversification out of its core businesses.
The downward revision in earnings estimates for Matsushita Electric
Industrial reported in last Wednesday's paper covered the half year ending
next month, not the full fiscal year as reported.
