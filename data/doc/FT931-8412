FT  19 FEB 93 / Technology: New propellant flies high - Worth Watching
Gunpowder, the essential ingredient in today's fireworks, could soon be
replaced by a safer alternative.
Gunpowder is used as the lifting charge to propel the firework into the sky.
Now researchers at the Cranfield Institute of Technology, working for
Standard Fireworks, have developed an equally effective propellant which is
bound with a polymer which makes it less sensitive - and therefore safer -
and less expensive.
Cranfield's Alan Bailey has also developed an economical method of making
the coloured 'stars' that shoot out of roman candles based on memories of
jelly babies being made in a sweet factory.
There the jelly was poured into a mould of cornflour, which formed the outer
coating of the sweet. In the pyrotechnic version the cornflour is replaced
by 'igniter' material, which coats the metal pellets. Cranfield Institute of
