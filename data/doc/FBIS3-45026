  [Text] Beijing, January 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Vice-President Rong Yiren expressed the hope here today that 
China and Zimbabwe would tap the great potential for bilateral 
cooperation in political, economic, cultural and other fields, 
and further promote their ties of friendship. 
  Rong made the remarks at a meeting with Zimbabwean 
parliament 
speaker Nolan Chipo Makombe and his party at the Great Hall of 
the People. 
  Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, Sino-Zimbabwean 
relations in every field have developed steadily, and there have 
been frequent contacts at all levels, Rong said. 
  He expressed the belief that the current visit by Makombe 
would further promote the friendly ties between the two peoples, 
the two governments and the two parliaments. 
  China and Zimbabwe are both developing countries, Rong said, 
adding that they share common or similar views on major 
international issues and that they can continue to cooperate 
with each other in this regard. 
  Makombe expressed his agreement. 
  The Zimbabwe Government and its people are grateful to China 
for its support and assistance, Makombe said, adding that the 
visit was aimed at expanding the ties between the two 
parliaments and the two governments. 
  In response, Rong said China has provided Zimbabwe with some 
assistance within its means. Yet, China is still a developing 
country and the assistance is very limited. 
  He expressed the wish that in the future the two countries 
would further enhance their mutually beneficial cooperation in 
the economic and technological fields. 
  Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of China's National People's 
Congress Standing Committee, was present at the meeting.
