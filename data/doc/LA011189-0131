2 INNOCENT BYSTANDERS STRUCK BY STRAY BULLETS 
Two Santa Ana men in their 20s were in stable condition Tuesday after they were 
struck by stray bullets from a shooting in which they were not involved, police 
said. 
A Santa Ana police officer was writing a traffic ticket at about 7 p.m. Monday 
at the intersection of McFadden Avenue and Raitt Street when he heard several 
gunshots. Thinking someone was possibly shooting at him, the officer requested 
assistance, Santa Ana Police Sgt. Collie Provence said. 
When officers arrived in an alley near 700 S. Raitt St., they found Miguel 
Rosas, 24, of Santa Ana, who had been shot once in the buttocks, Provence said. 
Witnesses told police that another victim, Fredrico Briseno, 20, had been shot 
in the neck and was taken by friends to a hospital. 
"It appears that both victims had been hit by stray bullets fired by (people) 
in an unrelated fight that the victims were not involved in," Provence said. 
"(It also) appears that none of the gunshots had been fired at the officer, and 
the gunshots the officer heard go by him were stray rounds." 
Police believe that the weapon used was a small-caliber pistol. Officers did 
not have any suspects, and the shooting was under investigation to determine if 
it was gang-related, Provence said.
