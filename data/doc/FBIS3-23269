  [Excerpt] Baghdad, March 5 (AFP)--An Iraqi daily called for 
an alliance with Libya and Sudan on Saturday [5 March] to oppose 
"imperialism and Zionism" following the Hebron massacre. 
  The Babil newspaper, run by President Saddam Husayn's eldest 
son 'Uday, said it was "desirable for the leaders of Iraq, Libya 
and Sudan to hold a summit meeting ... and adopt a common 
stance" to meet the challenges facing Arabs in the wake of the 
February 25 massacre, when a Jewish settler gunned down dozens 
of Moslem worshippers. 
  Such an alliance was "necessary ... due to the complete 
inertia of the Arab League and its subservience to the wishes of 
traitors among the Arab leaders." 
  Babil said "only armed struggle can lead to freedom," and 
called on "all those concerned about the future of Palestine to 
declare that the Palestinian autonomy accord died in Hebron."
