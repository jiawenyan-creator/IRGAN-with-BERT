FT  13 JUL 93 / Intel's second quarter yields record results
INTEL, the world's largest maker of computer chips, yesterday reported
record revenue and earnings for the second quarter. It said it had shipped
more than 10,000 Pentium chips, its new high performance microprocessor.
Revenue for the second quarter rose 61 per cent to Dollars 2.13bn (Pounds
1.4bn) from Dollars 1.32bn in the same period last year. Net income was up
167 per cent at Dollars 569m, or Dollars 1.30 per share, compared with
Dollars 213m or 50 cents per share in last year's second quarter.
Earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations, but failed to reach the
highest estimates. Intel's share price fell slightly yesterday to Dollars 55
1/2 at midday, down from a Friday close of Dollars 56.
'We had an excellent quarter. Intel486 microprocessor volume continued to
expand and shipments of Pentium processor-based systems began,' said Mr
Andrew Grove, president and chief executive.
For the first six months of 1993, Intel's revenues rose 62 per cent to
Dollars 4.15bn, from Dollars 2.56bn last year. Net income surged 181 per
cent to Dollars 1.12bn or Dollars 2.53 per share, versus Dollars 397m or 93
cents per share.
First half earnings exceeded the Dollars 1.07bn the company earned for the
whole of 1992. Per-share earnings were restated to reflect a 2-for-1 stock
split in May, 1993.
