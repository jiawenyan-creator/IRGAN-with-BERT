THE SIDELINES; 
TENNIS' TEDDY TINLING DIES, 79 
Teddy Tinling, the man who revolutionized women's tennis wear and became a 
leading official on their tournament circuit, died today at age 79. 
Tinling died while being treated for a respiratory complaint in a Cambridge 
hospital, the hospital announced. 
The flamboyant Englishman's most celebrated, and controversial, moment came in 
1949 when he shocked the Wimbledon Establishment by designing lace-trimmed 
panties for a U.S. player, (Gorgeous) Gussie Moran. 
Tinling designed outfits for such Wimbledon champions as Maureen Connolly, 
Louise Brough, Doris Hart and Maria Bueno. He also acted for a number of years 
as the liaison man between players and officials at Wimbledon.
