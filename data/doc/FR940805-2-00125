 

4. The client eligibility requirements of rule 2053 reflect the SEC's recognition that certain high net worth
clients have the capacity to bear the perceived additional risks of performance fees, as well as the ability to protect
themselves adequately against the potential abuses of performance fees. Applicant is unable to rely on the rule because
the non-qualifying trusts do not meet the $500,000 under management or $1,000,000 net worth requirement. However,
applicant believes that exemptive relief from section 205(a)(i) is appropriate because: (a) the individuals charged
with making the investment decisions for applicant and the non-qualifying trusts satisfy the net worth requirements,
are financially sophisticated, and are fully able to assess the potential risks of performance fees; (b) the trustees
and custodians of the non-qualifying trusts are either close family members or long-term family employees, have
substantial assets invested in applicant and are therefore subject to the same risks as the beneficiaries; and (c)
the net worth of each beneficiary of the non-qualifying trust exceeds $1,000,000. Applicant believes the beneficiaries
of the non-qualifying trusts are wealthy investors who, together with the trustees and custodians, can understand
the effect on their investment of performance-based compensation and bear the potential risks of such fees.

5. Because those exercising investment authority for the non-qualifying trusts have such intimate and strong familial
relationships to the beneficiaries, applicant believes it is not unreasonable to presume that the commonality of
such interest will result in the decision-maker behaving in the best interests of the beneficiaries. Except for the
requested exemption for the non-qualifying trusts and custodianships, the requirements of rule 2053(b)
are satisfied in all other respects. Thus, applicant believes that granting the requested exemption is appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the Advisers Act.
