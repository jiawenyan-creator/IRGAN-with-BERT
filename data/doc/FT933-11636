FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Quebecor Printing foothold
QUEBECOR PRINTING, the biggest subsidiary of the Quebecor publishing group,
is buying 80 per cent of Fecomme, a Paris-based commercial offset printer,
for USDollars 14m. Fecomme has annual sales of Dollars 40m and three
printing plants.
This is Quebecor Printing's second attempt to gain a European foothold, and
the company says it plans further acquisitions.
Quebecor Printing is North America's second-largest commercial printer and
recently expanded into Mexico.
Sears Canada, the second-biggest retailer in Canada, reduced its losses in
the second quarter. But the company expects to be in the black by year-end,
despite the sluggish Ontario market.
The second quarter loss was CDollars 18.9m (USDollars 14.8m), or 20 cents a
share, against a deficit of CDollars 29.2m, or 34 cents, on revenues of
CDollars 892m, down 4.5 per cent.
