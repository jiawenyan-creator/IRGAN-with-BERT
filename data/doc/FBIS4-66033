  [Text] The Turkish side is continuing its lack of political 
will and its unacceptable delaying tactics regarding the 
acceptance of the 21 March document. On its side, the Cyprus 
Government, by showing its goodwill, has exhausted all limits. 
  This statement was made by Foreign Ministry Spokesman 
Konstandinos Bikas, who concluded by noting that the UN 
secretary general's report, expected to be submitted soon, will 
record the actual situation.
