  [Text] Bratislava, April 23 (CTK) -- A new political party 
-- the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS) was founded today 
through a merger of the Alternative of Political Realism (APR) 
of Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik and the Alliance of Slovak 
Democrats (AD) of former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko. The two 
parties' delegates agreed to the move at a merger assembly in 
Bratislava. 
  Moravcik has been proposed DEUS chairman, Knazko is likely 
to 
become the first deputy chairman. Other deputy chairmen would 
be Deputy Premier Roman Kovac, Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus, 
and Viliam Vaskovic, vice-president of the presidium of the 
National Property Fund (FNM). Voting on the above candidates is 
planned for the afternoon. 
  DEUS intends to push for the interests of people who want to 
live in a civic society, which respects civic freedoms, 
pluralist democracy, the market economy and freedom of trade. 
  According to a recent poll, the APR and the AD together have 
9 per cent of electoral preferences, and are the third strongest 
political grouping in Slovakia, after the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and the Democratic Left Party (SDL).
