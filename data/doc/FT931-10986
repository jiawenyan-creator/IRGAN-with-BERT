FT  05 FEB 93 / Lloyd's disbands committees in radical shake-up
LLOYD'S of London yesterday announced a radical overhaul of its complex
committee structure as part of efforts to improve management and cut costs.
The insurance market will disband 31 of 48 committees that advise or act on
behalf of the council, the market's governing body. Their functions will be
taken over by new market and regulatory boards.
Mr David Rowland, chairman, said the changes represented a 'very substantial
change in the way we handle our affairs' and would bring Lloyd's into line
with standard corporate practice.
Mr Rowland said members of the two new boards would be asked to take
individual responsibility for areas of work - ranging from training to
registration of agencies and brokers - formerly handled by committee. These
individuals would be accountable to the council.
Mr Rowland said Lloyd's had been 'bedevilled for years' by its committee
structure. Representatives of agencies and brokers spent too much time on
committee business. The committees were also a 'drain' on the resources of
the corporation, which administers and regulates Lloyd's.
The changes are part of an extensive review of business practices at
Lloyd's, started when Mr Peter Middleton became chief executive last
September.
Lloyd's announced late last year that 200 of the 2,200 jobs at the
corporation would go as part of a Pounds 26.6m budget cut. The market's
agency structure - which links Names with their syndicates - is among a
number of areas under review by the market board, which expects to announce
details of a 'business plan' for Lloyd's in the second half of April.
Lloyd's announced that 100 syndicates intended to insure against terrorist
damage as part of a new mutual company being formed by the UK insurance
industry.
