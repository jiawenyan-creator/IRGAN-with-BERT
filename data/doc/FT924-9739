FT  04 NOV 92 / Observer: Peripatetic pen-pushers
If you are wondering about the City analyst who has been turning in those
hefty profit warnings on your company, Citigate may be able to help.
The PR pundits who last week, with Price Waterhouse, published the third
annual Who's Who of Analysts, have just finished reading the tea-leaves on
the information gathered during the course of the directory's compilation.
The stereotype teenage scribblers emerge roughly as follows:
They are male (86 per cent), probably married (64 per cent), and
Oxbridge-educated (24 per cent). A staggeringly well-prepared 16 per cent
have read economics, with the next most popular degree (5 per cent) business
studies. Recruiters obviously pay attention to star signs, because a pushy
and determined 11 per cent are Aries, whereas only a complex, introverted 6
per cent are Scorpios. They are in their mid-30s, and are most interested
(what an uninspired lot) in travel, music and golf.
Their pressured existence notwithstanding, Messrs Average Analyst are big
achievers in the marital stability stakes - with a nationally highly
atypical O84 per cent divorced. The same cannot be said, however, of their
record on the employment continuity front.
Of course, we did know that analysts were an itinerant bunch - shoved from
pillar to post by their employers these days as much as being desperately in
search of the bigger bonus. But Citigate can now reveal that, among those
analysts at firms which appear in both the 1989 and the 1992 surveys, only a
paltry 31.5 per cent have not changed sides in the intervening three years.
'Think of the savings for the pension funds,' mused one scribbler, the
fruits of whose research has landed on his clients' desks from a number of
different addresses.
