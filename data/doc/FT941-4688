FT  10 MAR 94 / Dorrell to aid investment flow
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, yesterday raised
the prospect of alterations to the tax structure to improve the flow of
funds from savings to investment.
Speaking at a Confederation of British Industry seminar, Mr Dorrell set out
the objectives of his review of savings and the movement of funds through
the economy, announced by the chancellor last summer.
The purpose of the review is to examine the relationship between savings and
investment and to ask how best to allocate capital efficiently within the
economy.
'We need to consider the extent to which we are prepared to use the tax
system to encourage a wider menu of options for financing business,' said Mr
Dorrell.
In his speech to CBI members he highlighted a number of areas of weakness in
the economy. These included:
Manufacturing accounts for a relatively small share of economic activity.
The medium-size business sector is relatively undeveloped, particularly
compared with Germany.
There is evidence that it is difficult to raise significant amounts of
capital for high-tech start-ups in Britain.
Dividend payout ratios appear to be relatively high in the UK,
The financial secretary said the review needed to ask how well institutional
shareholders - which play a crucial role in capital markets - functioned.
Investors in the venture capital trusts, announced in the November Budget,
will be allowed tax relief on up to Pounds 100,000 a year, under proposals
in a government consultative document.
Published yesterday, the document suggests the trusts should be taxed and
structured in a broadly similar way to investment trusts.
