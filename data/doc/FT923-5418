FT  01 SEP 92 / International Company News: Hafnia turns in loss of
DKr3.87bn in first half
HAFNIA HOLDING, the Danish insurer which suspended payments on August 20,
yesterday announced a first-half loss of DKr3.87bn (Dollars 686m) compared
with a DKr530m profit in the previous corresponding period.
The deficit was due primarily to a DKr2.15bn loss on its shareholdings in
Swedish insurer, Skandia, and Danish insurer, Baltica.
Negotiations are continuing with both companies to find ways of disposing of
these holdings, the company said yesterday.
A fall in the value of other securities caused a further loss of DKr655m.
The holding company's assets were transferred in August to a new holding
company, Hafnia Holding 1992, which left the debt in the former holding
company, which is in the hands of the receivers.
'This construction gives Hafnia a much better chance of continuing its
business than a traditional suspension of payments,' the company said.
The model chosen enables the parent company to provide financial support to
its subsidiaries.
This would not have been possible under a traditional suspension, said the
group.
The new holding company has equity capital of DKr5.9bn.
High administrative costs and substantial loss provisions against
engagements by Hafnia Marine &amp; Industrial Insurance were additional factors
in the first-half collapse.
Last week, the group announced the dismissal of 524 employees in Denmark, or
about one-fifth of total staff in Denmark.
Reductions are also being made in staff at Economic, the group's UK insurer.
The result in the second half would depend on two factors, success or
otherwise in efforts to sell the shareholdings in Baltica and Skandia and
developments in the Danish share and bond markets, the company said.
