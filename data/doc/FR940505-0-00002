SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations by adding new provisions designed to implement
the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA). The EAJA provides for the award of fees and expenses to certain individuals
and businesses that prevail in agency formal adjudicatory proceedings in which the agency's position is determined
not to have been substantially justified.

I. Background 


The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) became law on October 21, 1981 (5 U.S.C. 504). The EAJA authorizes agencies to
award attorney fees and other expenses to parties that prevail over an agency in certain agency proceedings under
specified circumstances. Generally, for an award to be made, the proceeding must be one that is ``required by statute
to be determined on the record.'' 

See, Ardestani 

v. 

U.S. Department of Justice, 

____ U.S. ____, 112 S.Ct. 515 (1991). 
On October 28, 1981 (46 FR 53189), the NRC published a proposed rule designed to implement the EAJA in the 

Federal Register

. However, serious doubt developed as to the need for the regulations. A significant consideration in this regard
was the impact of a statutory bar against the use of funds appropriated to the NRC ``to pay the expenses of, or otherwise
compensate, parties intervening in regulatory or adjudicatory proceedings.'' This provision first appeared in
the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 1981 (Pub. L. No. 966367, Sec. 502, 94 Stat. 1344, 1345
(1980)), and has continued to appear each year in subsequent NRC appropriation acts. In addition, case law developed
in the 1980's indicating that the Commission would receive judicial support if it determined that no NRC license proceeding
of any kind is covered by the EAJA. 
With the enactment of the Inspector General Act Amendments of 1988 (Pub. L. 100504, 1102 Stat. 2515), which
established an Office of the Inspector General in the NRC, the NRC became subject to the Program Fraud Civil Remedies
Act (PFCRA), 31 U.S.C. ch. 38. Hearings under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act are expressly covered by the EAJA,
necessitating the issuance of EAJA regulations by the NRC. However, because of the length of time that had gone by since
the NRC issued the 1981 proposed EAJA rule, the Commission replaced it with a new proposed rule, published on August
2, 1993 (58 FR 41061). The new proposed rule was essentially similar to a model rule suggested by the Administrative
Conference of the United States (ACUS) for agency adoption. (May 6, 1988, 51 FR 16665.) 


II. Responses to Comments Received


In response to the August 2, 1993 proposed rule, the NRC received one set of comments from ACUS and one set from the Nuclear
Management and Resources Council (NUMARC). The NRC's consideration of the comments follows. 


A. Time Deadlines 


1. Decision on the Petition for Increase of Maximum Rate for Attorney Fees




Comment. 

ACUS recommended that the rule provide a specific time frame for agency action on a petition for rulemaking to increase
the maximum rate for attorney fees. 


Response.

 The EAJA provides a $75 hourly ceiling on attorney fees, but allows agencies to raise the statutory ceiling by regulation.
The proposed rule provides that any person may file with the Commission a petition for rulemaking to increase the $75
maximum hourly rate for attorney fees, and refers to 10 CFR 2.802 and 2.803 for the procedures to be followed with respect
to such petitions. Neither the proposed rule nor 10 CFR 2.802 nor 10 CFR 2.803 provides a specific time frame for agency
action on the petition for rulemaking. A sentence has been added to 10 CFR 12.107 requiring the Commission to determine
what action it will take on the petition within 90 days after the petition is filed.
