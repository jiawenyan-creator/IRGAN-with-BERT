SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
History


On April 4, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to provide additional
airspace to accommodate arrival/departure aircraft transitioning between the en route and terminal areas in southeastern
Oregon (59 FR 15670). Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the
term ``transition area,'' and certain airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the
earth are now Class E airspace areas. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. Interested
parties were invited to participate in the rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal.
No comments were received. This action is the same as the proposal except for a typographical error discovered and
corrected herein in the coordinates for La Grande/Union County Airport. The coordinates for this airspace docket
are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace is published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June
17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).
The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.


The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class E airspace at La Grande, Oregon. The FAA has
determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and
routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
