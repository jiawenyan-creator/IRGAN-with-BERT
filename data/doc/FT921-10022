FT  08 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses early gains
as futures fall
SHARE PRICES trimmed early gains on a lack of fresh news ahead of the
weekend, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average rose 2.20 to 22,107.12, up 0.4 per cent on the week,
after a high of 22,373.08 and a low of 22,103.42. Continued
arbitrage-related buying pushed the index up in the morning but a fall in
futures prices in the afternoon prompted arbitrageurs to unwind their
positions.
Volume was steady at 200m shares. Advances led declines by 522 to 470 with
156 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 3.83
to 1,627.42 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.96 to 1,243.44.
Dealers dominated the market, while institutional investors remained on the
sidelines. 'Institutions have placed a lot of buying orders at the lower
levels, but no one wants to buy or sell at current prices,' said Mr Masami
Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Highly-priced, small capitalisation stocks, which had risen recently on
short-term buying, ran into profit-taking. Sega Enterprises fell Y100 to
Y13,900 and Keyence declined Y600 to Y11,300.
Sharp, the most active issue of the day, rose Y60 to Y1,430. The electronics
company saidrecently that it would sell high definition television sets at
Y1m, one-quarter of the current average prices. Sharp also announced a
semiconductor partnership with Intel, the US semiconductor maker, to develop
flash memory devices, a smaller and lighter semiconductor chip which can be
erased and reprogrammed.
Electronics makers fell on profit forecast downgradings. Hitachi fell Y5 to
Y898 and Toshiba by Y9 to Y635.
Bridgestone, the tyre maker, rose Y20 to Y1,150 on reports that Firestone,
its US subsidiary, would make a profit in the latter part of this year.
Speculators focused on Aids-related issues. Meiji Milk Products, which is
developing an anti-Aids drug, lost Y9 to Y900 on profit-taking after an
initial rise, but Okamoto Industries, the prophylactic maker, rose Y22 to
Y955.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 37.37 to 23,691.20 on small-lot selling late
in the day, in volume of 52.4m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker lost
Y500 to Y11,300.
Roundup
THE TWO remaining markets to reopen after the Chinese New Year, Hong Kong
and Taiwan, went in different directions yesterday.
HONG KONG climbed in heavy trading, the Hang Seng index closing 39.28 higher
at 4711.37, its second consecutive record high, for a 2.4 per cent rise on
the week. The index is up 9 1/2 per cent this year. Turnover hit HKDollars
2.8bn, its heaviest in two weeks, compared with Monday's half-day HKDollars
1.64bn.
Expectations of an interest rate cut, a new year rally, political
indications from China, and the sheer momentum of the recent rally were all
given credit for the gains.
TAIWAN tumbled in its first day's trading since it hit its 1992 high on
January 30, the weighted index losing 154.26 points, or 2.9 per cent to
5237.37 in turnover down from TDollars 56.6bn to TDollars 38.3bn.
Some brokers said that this was a technical correction, others that it was
also a reaction to Premier Hau Pei-tsun's call last week for a crackdown on
speculation.
The central bank is also expected to resume money market operations to
tighten liquidity next week.
KUALA LUMPUR saw buying by Malaysian corporations, supplemented by
government-controlled institutions and short-term investors as the composite
index ended up 14.03, or 2.4 per cent, at 589.84, 3.4 per cent higher on the
week.
BANGKOK featured a strong rally by Bangkok Land for the second straight day
as the SET index rose 8.99 to 780.08, 2.3 per cent better on the week, in
turnover of Bt12.4bn.
JAKARTA reported active local buying as the official index gained 7.16, or
2.5 per cent to 294.22, up 4.2 per cent on the week.
BOMBAY's bull run collided with rumours of a build-up of troops along the
border with Pakistan. The BSE index dropped 114.88, or 5 per cent to
2,194.48, although share prices were reported to be recovering after hours,
as the rumours subsided.
