  [Text] Lhasa, May 29 (XINHUA) -- The Public Health 
Department of Lhasa city, capital of China's Tibet Autonomous 
Region, has adopted a variety of methods in recent years to 
improve the sanitary conditions for local Tibetan residents. 
  The city has more than 280,000 farmers and herdsmen in the 
surrounding rural areas. As the drinking water in the area 
lacks iodine and selenium, the city has invested more than three 
million yuan since 1990 to build nearly 400 water supply 
stations with water supply pipes and deep wells. 
  The local government is also persuading and helping local 
villagers to build lavatories. Now more than 3,600 household 
lavatories have been built. 
  The Public Health Department has shot several video tapes 
including "water and public health" and "women's and children's 
hygiene" and broadcast them in rural areas to heighten sanitary 
knowledge. 
  A book about hygiene was written and has become part of a 
compulsory course for primary school pupils in the area.
