FT  02 JAN 93 / Chirpy GMTV greets the nation
'A CONVENTIONAL breakfast show this isn't,' claimed the anchorman. At just
after 6am on New Year's Day not too many viewers were around to dispute this
proud boast for Good Morning Television, which yesterday took over the
breakfast franchise from TV-am.
On the first morning of ITV's Big Bang the GMTV formula for greeting the
nation appeared thoroughly conventional - cheerful, fast-paced, and
resolutely populist.
On Thursday, the last rather lugubrious morning for TV-am, one of the
sillier tributes paid was that the programme had stood for 'very visual
colour'. The set of GMTV is certainly highly visual - a sunburst-yellow
lounge with pink sofas and an Impressionist still-life.
The presenters are under 40 and as confident and chirpy as sparrows.
Predictably, the top news story of the morning was Princess Diana on the
Caribbean island of Nevis. GMTV had its own royal-watcher there who gushed
predictable twaddle. Items on Somalia and Slovakia came later.
Body culture looks like being an important ingredient in the morning recipe,
and not only features on health and exercise. A female fashion presenter
modelled stretchy black underwear in the studio and a female travel reporter
will do much of her work in a swimsuit.
Evidently GMTV has no aspirations to challenge its audience's intelligence.
The technology reporter ducked an explanation of how potatoes can contain
electricity by saying dismissively: 'Oh, it's all chemistry and that sort of
thing.' But it was a slick, confident debut.
Carlton Television's first contributions have been desperately banal.
Yesterday afternoon's Surprise Party, presented by Michael Parkinson, was a
reworking of This Is Your Life.
Richard Branson as the mystery personality was taken unctuously through his
glorious career.
