FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Division makes Pounds 9.6m cash call
Division, the Bristol-based virtual reality computer technology company, is
raising Pounds 9.6m through a 3-for-10 rights issue of up to 10.1m shares at
100p each.
The shares closed 13p up at 133p yesterday.
At the same time, Division, which was floated on the Stock Exchange in May
last year at 40p a share, estimated that it would carry a pre-tax loss of
not more than Pounds 1.44m in the year to October 31, against a Pounds
503,000 deficit last time.
The full-year loss, which reflects heavy investment in product development
and marketing, was foreshadowed at the interim stage.
The company said yesterday that sales for the second half of the year, 'have
followed the trend of earlier years with strong underlying growth
continuing.'
Turnover for the year is expected to have more than doubled to Pounds 5.27m
(Pounds 2.08m), boosted by strong growth in the group's blue-chip customer
base.
Mr Charles Grimsdale, managing director, said the new funds would be used
'to provide additional working capital and support the company's anticipated
growth, including future products.'
Since the flotation last year, which raised about Pounds 5m, Division has
made considerable progress in the development of new virtual reality
products and in particular, specialised 3-D graphics technology.
Last December it launched a new high-power graphics accelerator, based on
technology licensed from the University of North Carolina.
The VPX accelerator uses thousands of tiny micro-processors working in
parallel to compute images on a screen and has been sold mainly for
engineering, training and scientific applications.
The issue has been underwritten by Albert E Sharp.
