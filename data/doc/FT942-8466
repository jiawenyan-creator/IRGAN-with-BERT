FT  20 MAY 94 / People: Baker and Harris leave Herring Baker Harris
Herring Baker Harris, a troubled surveying company, yesterday announced that
Michael Baker and Simon Harris, who founded part of the group, are leaving
the business.
'They feel they would like to go back to doing their own thing in their own
way,' said Jeremy Pratt, finance director.
Baker, 47, and Harris, 46, will remain directors until January 31 1995, but
they have already relinquished their executive responsibilities. They are in
discussions with the company about the enforcement of restrictions in their
contracts, which prevent them from setting up in competition within a year.
Baker and Harris became directors of the combined group in December 1991,
following the merger of Herring Son &amp; Daw with Baker Harris Saunders, a
company with offices in London, New York, Los Angeles and Denver.
The rationale of the merger was to increase Herring Son &amp; Daw's exposure to
agency work. However, the company encountered problems, particularly in its
US operations, and made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 430,000 for the year to
January 31.
'In our business the strengths of the group are greater and the interests
more important than those of any individual,' says Nick Owen, the chairman.
'The departure of Messrs Baker and Harris will not have an impact on our
core areas of activity in rating, agency and investment, where the client
base remains very strong throughout the group.'
Herring Baker Harris has no plans to change its name. The shares closed down
7p to 41p.
