FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Nykredit takes 15% holding in
Bikuben
Nykredit, the largest of the Danish mortgage credit institutions, is to take
a 15 per cent stake in Bikuben, the country's third largest bank.
The mortgage group will invest DKr540m (Dollars 88.5m) to acquire a 5 per
cent stake from Bikuben, which will offer a further 10 per cent through a
direct share issue at DKr188 a share.
The agreement means Bikuben will use its branch network to recommend
Nykredit's mortgage loans.
In return, Nykredit, which has similar arrangements with 54 banks, will
refrain from setting up a retail banking operation.
Bikuben recently announced a programme to cut its staff and branch network
to strengthen its earnings over the next three years.
The agreement between Bikuben and Nykredit is a response to the challenge by
the two big banks, Den Danske Bank and Unibank, which together have a
two-thirds market share in Danish banking services.
Both have set up their own mortgage credit subsidiaries, which are growing
fast, although their market shares are still in low single-digit figures.
The purchase will make Nykredit the largest single shareholder in Bikuben,
and give it the maximum stake a single shareholder may own in the bank,
according to Bikuben's articles of association.
Nykredit will also obtain two seats on Bikuben's supervisory board.
