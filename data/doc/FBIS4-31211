  [Text] In connection with a statement made by Serbian 
Radical Party Chairman Vojislav Seselj in Novi Banovci, that all 
Croats ought to be evicted from Serbia, the Democratic Alliance 
of Vojvodina Croats issued a public statement today saying: 
  The Democratic Alliance of Vojvodina Croats vehemently 
protests against Seselj's statement and appeals to all Croats in 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to not be afraid, as Seselj 
is only providing the International War Crimes Tribunal with new 
evidence against himself. Seselj is simplifying consequences of 
the disintegration of the communist system and is offering 
solutions through ethnic cleansing, i.e. genocide, in order to 
reopen the circle of violence and conflicts and thus prolong the 
time in which violence would rule over reason, ethics, and 
morals, says the statement of the Democratic Alliance of 
Vojvodina Croats that was made public in Subotica today.
