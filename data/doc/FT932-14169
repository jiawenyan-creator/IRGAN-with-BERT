FT  20 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Coverage of new issues
includes yield spreads
STARTING today, the Financial Times' daily coverage of new issues in the
international bond market is being extended to include yield spreads, where
relevant.
In the new international bond issues table, the numbers shown (in basis
points) are the yield spreads at which each issue was launched over the
relevant benchmark government bond. The coupon and maturity of the benchmark
are shown in brackets after the spread: where further details are necessary,
they will be shown in a note. The spreads are supplied by the lead managers
of each transaction.
Details of prices and fees are being amended to reflect the prevalance of
the fixed-price reoffer method of selling bonds in the Euromarket. For bonds
sold using the fixed-price reoffer system, the price shown for each bond is
the price at which they are offered to investors (an 'R' next to the price
indicates this method of pricing). For these issues, the fees paid to
underwriters will be shown at the reoffer level: they indicate the fees
earned by underwriters if the bonds are sold at the reoffer price.
For other issues, the price shown is the issue price, with the full fees for
underwriters if the bonds were sold at that price.
