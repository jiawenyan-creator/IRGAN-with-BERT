FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Saab Auto looks to save SKr2bn
SWEDEN's Saab Automobile said yesterday it would cut 2,000 jobs in a bid to
improve productivity and restore profits to its operations. The aim is to
achieve cost savings of SKr2bn (Dollars 335m).
The worst-hit facility will be the group's main Trollhatten plant, where
1,650 jobs, or more than 20 per cent of the workforce, will be cut. A
further 330 jobs will be shed at the company's Gothenburg and Sodertalje
operations.
Saab, which is jointly owned by Saab-Scania and General Motors of the US,
said it had been forced to take action because of the poor sales outlook and
the losses it continued to sustain.
Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, who took over as chief executive in September,
said: 'We are losing more than one million dollars a day. These actions are
necessary to safeguard Saab's future.'
The group said it made a loss of SKr1.34bn in the first nine months, 36 per
cent less than the SKr2.11bn deficit in the same 1991 period. But the loss
worsened in the third quarter to SKr541m from SKr522m a year ago, and the
full year result is expected to be in line with the SKr2.2bn loss sustained
last year.
Sales in the first nine months were higher at 66,800 units, compared with
64,700, but the forecast for the full year is unchanged at 87,500. Next year
output is expected to total just 80,000 units.
