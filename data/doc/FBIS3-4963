  [Text] Sendai, March 3 KYODO -- Japanese apple growers 
outraged over the expected opening of the market to apples from 
the United States staged a protest rally in Sendai on Thursday[3 
March], warning that cheap imports would result in the collapse 
of domestic production. 
  Tokuei Kimura, chairman of the Apple Growers' Association of 
top-producing Aomori Prefecture, accused the government of 
neglecting domestic producers by lifting the ban without taking 
sufficient precautions. 
  "The current quarantine system does not prevent infested 
imports," Kimura told some 500 apple growers from all over the 
nation. 
  Following the rally the apple growers staged a demonstration 
in the city center. 
  Tokyo officially opened its apple market in 1971 but 
continued to ban imports from the U.S., saying there was not 
enough proof they do not carry insects or viruses. 
  A similar ban on apples from New Zealand was lifted last 
June 
on grounds that they meet quarantine regulations. Frustrated 
U.S. growers have said they would seek trade sanctions against 
Japan. 
  In an effort to end the decades-long apple dispute, Tokyo 
said it would import U.S. apples from this fall at the earliest 
following a revision of quarantine checks.
