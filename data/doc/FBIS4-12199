  [Text] Pakistan has told the United States that it will 
never compromise on its vital security matters by unilaterally 
revising its nuclear program. This was conveyed by the chief of 
the Army Staff during his talks in Washington with senior U.S. 
officials including Defense Secretary William Perry, National 
Security Adviser Anthony Lake, and Deputy Secretary of State 
Strobe Talbott. He made it clear that Pakistan will not 
consider U.S. proposals on nuclear nonproliferation in South 
Asia until India also accepts them. Bilateral military 
cooperation between Pakistan and the United States and 
cooperation in security matters also came up during these 
meetings. 
  The Army chief apprised the U.S. authorities of Pakistan's 
security concerns, especially India's increasing military 
capability, and its effects on Pakistan's vital interests. He 
told the U.S. authorities that India is amassing weapons, 
thereby widening the military imbalance in the region. It will 
harm South Asian regional security and further heighten the 
existing tension in the region.
