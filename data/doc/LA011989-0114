WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA; 
DEVELOPER'S PLEA: NOT GUILTY 
Developer Abby Sher has pleaded not guilty to opening a museum-and-restaurant 
complex without proper permits, and a trial has been scheduled for Feb. 15, the 
city attorney's office reported. 
The plea was entered Tuesday in Municipal Court. 
Sher faces 15 counts of criminal violation of municipal codes stemming from a 
variety of art preview shows and open houses she allowed to be held at her 
Edgemar complex on Main Street last year. 
The city contends that she did not have occupancy and fire permits and, in some 
cases, did not have a proper business license. 
The complex houses the private Santa Monica Museum of Art and space for a 
restaurant.
