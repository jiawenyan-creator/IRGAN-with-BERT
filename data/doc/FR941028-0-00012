On July 28, 1994, the Commission issued a final rule

1

 in the above referenced proceeding (Order No. 567) which removed from the Commission's regulations certain natural
gas regulations related to natural gas producer regulation that were either obsolete or nonessential in light of
the decontrol of wellhead prices. Among others, part 270 was removed. This order addresses eight requests for rehearing
of the July 28, 1994 final rule.

The issue raised on rehearing is whether the Commission should have eliminated 270.203(c) of the Commission's
regulations. That section included in the definition of first sale all sales by an affiliate of an interstate pipeline,
intrastate pipeline, or local distribution company. Rehearing applicants contend that, as a result, the Commission
has improperly deprived affiliated marketer sales of their status as deregulated first sales under the Wellhead
Decontrol Act.


II. Background


Section 2(21) of the NGPA defines a first sale. Sections 2(21) (A) (i)(iv) and (B) set forth a general definition
of a first sale that excludes sales of affiliates of inter- and intrastate pipelines and local distribution companies
(LDCs) from the first sale definition unless the affiliate is selling gas it produced. However, section 2(21)(A)(v)
grants the Commission authority to define, as a first sale, any sale that does not qualify under sections 2(21)(A)
(i)(iv) ``in order to prevent circumvention of any maximum lawful price established under this Act.''
In 1979, in Order No. 58 implementing the NGPA, the Commission exercised its NGPA section 2(21)(A)(v) authority to
define all sales by pipeline affiliates as first sales. That definition was set forth in 18 CFR 270.203(c). Specifically,
270.203(c) provides that any sale by an affiliate of an interstate pipeline, intrastate pipeline, or LDC is
a first sale under the NGPA unless the Commission determines not to treat it as such. The Commission explained that
the reason for such treatment of affiliate sales was to prevent circumvention of the NGPA maximum lawful prices because
otherwise an entity could avoid first sale treatment by becoming an affiliate of a pipeline.

 Thus, although sales by interstate pipeline marketing affiliates generally would not qualify as first sales under
NGPA sections (21) (A) (i)(iv) and (B), they came to be defined as first sales by reason of 270.203(c).

Regs., Regulations Preambles 19771981 30,101 at 30,722 (1979). Although Order No. 58 was overturned
in Public Service Commission v. Mid-Louisiana Gas Co., 463 U.S. 319 (1983), the Commission continued the first sale
status for affiliate sales in Order No. 391, FERC Stats.  Regs., Regulations Preambles 19821985 30,588

</FOOTNOTE>


The Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989 repealed as of January 1, 1993, the entire Title I of the NGPA which contains
the ceiling prices. However, the Decontrol Act did not remove nor modify NGPA section 2(21), including the authorization
for the Commission to define as first sales those sales that would not otherwise qualify for such status.
Order No. 567 removed from the Commission's regulations certain natural gas regulations related to natural gas producer
regulation that the Commission considered obsolete or nonessential in light of the decontrol of wellhead prices.
These included the 270.203(c) definition of a first sale.
On rehearing of Order No. 567, the petitioners urge the Commission to retroactively reinstate 270.203(c).
They argue that the removal of 270.203(c) adversely affects marketing affiliates of interstate pipelines
by placing them at a competitive disadvantage in relation to non-regulated non-affiliated marketers. They assert
that the removal of the regulation means that affiliated marketer sales will no longer qualify as deregulated first
sales under the Wellhead Decontrol Act and that they will become subject to Natural Gas Act (NGA) price and non-price
regulation. They contend that the blanket marketer certificates that would apply under the NGA are not equivalent
to deregulation and are always subject to change or termination by the Commission. They assert that treatment as non-regulated
first sales is essential to continue fair competition among affiliated and non-affiliated marketers.
Finally, the parties contend that the Commission has failed to satisfy the requirements of the Administrative Procedure
Act (APA) by removing 270.203(c) without public notice or opportunity to comment.
