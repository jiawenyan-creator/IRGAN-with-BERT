FT  12 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Gold price finds support after
hitting six-week low - Market Report
The GOLD price dipped to the lowest level since the end of August at the
London bullion market yesterday before struggling back up a little in what
one dealer described as 'a bit of a dead cat bounce'.
'But at least it seemed to have found a level and may even be trying to
break through on the upside,' he added as the price closed at Dollars 388.25
a troy ounce, down Dollars 2.25 on the day and Dollars 4.45 on the week so
far, but Dollars 2.75 above its lunchtime low.
Bullion's shaky morning was prompted by a lacklustre performance on Monday
and Australian producer and commission house selling finding the market
long, dealers said.
They added that disillusionment had set in for the longs after the price
failed to get through Dollars 400 an ounce when apparently well primed two
weeks ago and to a lesser extent last week.
'It may pick up from here,' one suggested. 'It needed this to clear out the
tired longs.'
London Metal Exchange COPPER prices staged a sharp mid-afternoon rally after
hearing that the cheapest offer to the US Mint at its tender yesterday was
Dollars 2,575 a tonne, confirming that high premiums ruled in the US market,
dealers said.
Short-covering and speculative buying saw the three moths price climb from
an early low of Dollars 2,464 a tonne to close at Dollars 2,486, still down
on its earlier high of Dollars 2,506 and Dollars Dollars 5.50 below Monday's
close.
Dealers said copper earlier fell under speculative and stop-loss selling but
appeared to find support below its medium term trendline at Dollars 2,470.
They noted that a big fall in LME stocks had been reported in the morning as
metal continued to be shipped from Europe to the premium US market.
At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures shrugged off an early plunge
to end the day significantly higher, helped by a short-covering rally and
increased roaster buying. At the close the January position was quoted at
Dollars 3,533 a tonne, Dollars 87 up on the day and Dollars 183 above the
morning low.
The early fall was prompted by a weak close on Monday in New York. But
traders said that they then noticed increased roaster and trade buying.
'Being a lot cheaper, they will be a lot more comfortable buying at these
levels,' one explained.
OIL prices moved in a fairly narrow range as uncertainty about the
implications of the Gulf crisis for future supply led dealers to adopt a
cautious stance.
