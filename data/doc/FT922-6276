FT  26 MAY 92 / Azeri talks with Armenia brought forward
AZERBAIJAN and Armenia are to meet on Thursday, a month earlier than
proposed by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), in
an attempt to find a solution to continuing hostilities in the region.
Mr Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, who is on a two-day visit
to Moscow, said yesterday that a meeting had been arranged by the CSCE ahead
of the proposed Minsk conference, tentatively set for June 29.
Mr Hikmet Cetin, Turkey's foreign minister, warned that if a meeting was
left any later it would allow Armenia to consolidate its recent military
gains, particularly in the Lachin corridor from Armenia to the enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh, where more than 1,500 people have been killed.
This week's meeting could have a vital bearing on Mr Demirel's standing at
home, where he is criticised by opposition parties and the press for his
cautious approach to the conflict.
Continuing hostilities also pose a challenge to Turkey's regional ambitions
just three weeks after Mr Demirel's successful week-long tour through
central Asia, where he sought to reaffirm Turkey's cultural, linguistic and
religious links with ethnic Turks.
Mr Demirel will have found President Turgut Ozal's recent call for Turkish
troop intervention unhelpful. But the leader is under growing pressure amid
Azeri claims that Armenian forces have stepped up attacks on Nakhichevan,
the autonomous Azeri territory bordering Turkey and Iran.
'The status quo of Nakhichevan cannot be changed without the consent of
Turkey. I hope no one should dare it,' Mr Demirel said in Moscow yesterday,
in a clear warning to Armenian nationalists .
Thursday's meeting is due to be attended by officials from the US, France,
UK and Russia, A venue has still to be decided.
