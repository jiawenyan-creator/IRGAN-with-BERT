NATION; 
TREASURY TO BORROW $17 BILLION 
The Treasury Department said today it will borrow $17 billion on an emergency 
basis early next week so it can pay Social Security benefits to 38.9 million 
retirees and avert an unprecedented government default. 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the emergency borrowing will enable 
monthly Social Security checks to go out on schedule Nov. 3 regardless of 
whether Congress breaks a deadlock and passes an increase in the national debt 
limit. 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) denounced the emergency 
action as "obviously a transparent political move to enhance the effort to get 
a capital-gains tax cut. There apparently is no limit to what they'll do" to 
reach that goal.
