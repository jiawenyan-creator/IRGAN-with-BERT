  [Text] Beijing, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin encouraged the Red Cross Society of China (RCSC) to 
contribute more to world peace and development. 
  Jiang, also general secretary of the Central Committee of 
the 
Chinese Communist Party and the honorary director of the Red 
Cross Society of China, made the remarks during his meeting with 
the representatives attending the on-going 6th National Congress 
of the RCSC here today. 
  The president said that the RCSC, as an international 
organization engaging in humanitarian work in line with the 
basic principles of the International Red Cross Organization, 
has contributed much to China's development and become more and 
more popular among the people. 
  Jiang urged governments at all levels and the whole society 
to give their full support to RCSC members. 
  Grassroots organizations under the RCSC should learn from 
foreign experience in their work in accordance with practical 
domestic conditions, and emancipate their minds and work harder 
to promote the development of the Red Cross Society of China. 
  Chinese Premier Li Peng, away from China on his Central 
Asian 
tour, sent a message to the Congress, expressing his concern for 
the development of the Red Cross Society of China. 
  The RCSC, founded 90 years ago, now has 20 million members.
