  [Excerpt] Yesterday, Defense Minister Matio Enriquez said 
in response to the rebels' claims that the military might have 
perpetrated the attack on the San Juan Bridge, located on the 
Atlantic coast highway: "The only thing I can say is that I 
cannot conceive of anything as absurd as the URNG [Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity] communique" on the San Juan Bridge 
attack. 
  He reiterated that the military had exerted itself to 
restore 
traffic along that important highway; adding he does not believe 
law-abiding people are capable of perpetrating terrorist attacks 
like the most recent one. He also pointed out that the URNG 
admitted on several occasions it considers bridges, electric 
towers, or GUATEL [Guatemalan Telecommunications Enterprise] 
pylons as military targets. "I do not believe the military or 
any other Guatemalan group could created another terrorist 
faction because we are genuinely striving to achieve peace 
rather than to increase poverty and polarization," he added.
