HONIG TO SEEK TAX HIKE ON 'SUPER RICH' 
State schools Supt. Bill Honig has announced plans to seek a 1992 ballot 
initiative to raise the taxes of the "super rich" unless the governor and 
Legislature act first on the proposal. 
"We should raise (state) taxes by 5% on the top 1% of families in this state," 
Honig said Thursday as he introduced the idea at a California Taxpayers' Assn. 
meeting. Honig said the 5% increase would affect families making more than 
$208,560 a year who pay less in combined federal and state taxes than those who 
earn $70,000 or more. Honig said his proposal would raise $2 billion a year to 
finance California's future education, transportation and health care needs. If 
he follows through with his plan, Honig probably would have to seek a ballot 
initiative, given Gov. George Deukmejian's steadfast opposition to tax 
increases.
