FT  08 JUN 94 / World Trade News: UK wins big HK contracts
The building boom in Hong Kong shows little sign of slackening for British
companies with the award of two further orders for construction on projects
worth a combined Pounds 110m, writes Andrew Taylor, Construction
Correspondent.
Tarmac in a joint venture with Kumagai Gumi, the large Japanese construction
company, has won a Pounds 55m contract to design and built a new rail tunnel
under the harbour linking Hong Hong island with the West Kowloon peninsula.
Taylor Woodrow, another UK group, in a separate deal, is to manage the
Pounds 60m redevelopment of Kowloon station.
