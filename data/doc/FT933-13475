FT  19 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: M3 in focus
IT IS likely to be another tense week in European currency markets as
speculators look for signs of weakness in the ERM's defences, writes
Stephanie Flanders.
Their first opportunity may be the June figures for German money growth, due
out early this week, and the provisional figures for the German cost of
living index, which may be released on Friday, or early next week. Both will
have a bearing on whether the Bundesbank thinks it can cut official rates at
its July 29 council meeting, something which some dealers believe the ERM
needs if it is to survive.
Dealers will be trying to gauge the Bundesbank's commitment to support the
French franc and the Danish krone. Some market participants think that the
Danish government could be forced to devalue, even if the franc-D-Mark
parity survives.
Denmark's determination to resist speculators could cause problems for its
economy. The country is in recession while its year-on-year inflation rate
has fallen to 0.9 per cent. However, the Danish National Bank is raising its
key deposit and discount rates to 9.25 per cent from 7.25 per cent to give
the currency extra support.
Another possible victim of speculative pressure is the Belgian franc, which
could join the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo on the ERM's
'speculative fringe'.
Meanwhile, events in Europe could distract attention from Japan, where
yesterday's election result will have done little to banish the political
instability which has been casting a shadow over the yen.
Once again, the beneficiaries of Japanese and European uncertainty are
likely to be the Swiss franc, the dollar, and sterling. Neither Britain nor
the US has data out this week which is likely to change the muted
bullishness of recent weeks, although the chairman of the Federal Reserve's
annual testimony before Congress tomorrow and Thursday will doubtless
trigger theorising about future US interest rate movements.
