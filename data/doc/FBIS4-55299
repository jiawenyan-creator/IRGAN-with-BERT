  [Text] After their new meeting today the representatives 
of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] and the Civic 
Alliance for the Republic [GOR] declared that they have similar 
positions on the personnel and structural changes in the 
cabinet, our reporter Mariya Tsenkova reports. The final 
variant is expected on 13 or 17 May at the latest. 
  Ahmed Dogan and Aleksandur Tomov think that voting for the 
renewed cabinet could coincide with an agreement of the 
political forces to officially announce the date of the next 
parliamentary elections. Today or tomorrow the DPS will have 
consultations with the Bulgarian Socialist Party, while 
Aleksandur Tomov will meet tomorrow with representatives of the 
Alternative Social Liberal Party, Prime Minister Berov, and 
President Zhelev.
