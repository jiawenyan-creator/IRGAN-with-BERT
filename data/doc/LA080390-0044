THE LEGACY OF ART SEIDENBAUM 
I have a sense of personal loss but also a feeling that that is dwarfed by a 
community loss. Art's was a voice of sanity and enlightenment and above all 
judiciousness and compassion in an era of rampant ignorance and inane 
prejudices. Overall, a Renaissance man in a time when they're very scarce.
