  [Excerpts] While condemning the silence of the 
international community on the Rwandan tragedy, we cannot fail 
to deplore today the attitude of the African community, notably 
that of the Organization of African Unity, OAU. 
  Against all expectations, the latter has just accepted that 
the illegal government of criminals sits within the OAU. 
Yesterday we talked about the presence of two Rwandan 
delegations in Tunis, that of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] 
and that of the illegal government, for the 60th meeting of 
African foreign ministers, in preparation for the 30th summit of 
heads of state and governments of OAU member countries. [passage 
omitted] 
  To the great disappointment of the international community, 
the foreign ministers' meeting accorded support to the 
self-proclaimed government of Sindikubwabo. The RPF delegation 
will only participate in the summit of heads of state and 
government of OAU member countries as simple invitees of the OAU 
secretary general. [passage omitted]
