THE STATE 
An Oakland man who witnesses said wanted to make traffic move faster so one of 
his passengers could get to a bathroom was charged with fatally shooting 
another motorist on a freeway. Darryl Ray Poole, 19, of Oakland, is being held 
in Oakland's city jail without bail. He is accused of killing Lawrence 
Ellingsen, 53, on the Nimitz Freeway on Dec. 3 as Ellingsen and his wife, 
Sherri, were driving home to Newark after celebrating their 29th wedding 
anniversary. A bullet pierced the rear window of their car and struck him in 
the head. Mrs. Ellingsen managed to gain control of the car and steer it to the 
side of the road. She called her husband's death "so unrealistic. . . . To 
shoot at someone going 60 to 65 m.p.h. because someone had to go to the 
bathroom? I just can't imagine what kind of people we're dealing with."An 
anonymous phone tip led to Poole's arrest, police said.
