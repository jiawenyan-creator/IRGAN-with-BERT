FT  21 DEC 93 / Job seekers 'still face age barrier'
Employers are failing to recognise a skills gap at the lower end of the jobs
market which could be plugged by the use of older workers, a survey of
personnel officers by recruitment agency Brook Street says.
The survey showed that while employers were becoming slightly more receptive
to the recruitment of the over-35s there remained a deeply entrenched
tendency to recruit from people aged 18 to 35.
