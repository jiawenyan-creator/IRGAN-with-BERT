  [Text] We have just received the letter that Alija 
Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
has sent to members of the UN Security Council [UNSC] and the 
Council chairman (?for April). 
  Esteemed Sir, by the decision of Security Council Resolution 
Number 824 that your country also voted for, Gorazde was 
proclaimed a protected zone. However, on 30 March, the Serbian 
aggressor launched an offensive on this town, using artillery 
and tanks. Using their huge advantage in weapons and military 
hardware, Karadzic's Serbs have already taken some villages on 
the outskirts of the protected zone, setting to fire everything 
they reached. The exact toll among civilians is still not 
known, but it is certainly very high. 
  Esteemed Mr. Ambassador, in compliance with the seriousness 
of the situation, please demand for Resolution 824 to be 
consequently implemented, for further attacks at Gorazde to be 
immediately stopped, and for the attackers to be forced to 
withdraw to the lines that the protected zone had at the time it 
was proclaimed, that is, on 5 May 1993. 
  This is written in the letter President Izetbegovic sent to 
the chairman and members of the Security Council.
