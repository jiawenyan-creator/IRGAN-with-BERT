FT  12 JUN 92 / Observer: Exceptions to the rule
At a time like this, publishers surely ought to be trampling over one
another for the story of the heir to the throne's romantic liaison with his
former housekeeper.
Not so, however, when the heir concerned is the pretender to the throne of
France, Henri, Count of Paris. There apparently isn't much of a market
either for revelations about the private lives of the royalty of other
continental countries.
Take the Netherlands, for instance, where the liveliest such issue is the
health of Prince Claus, the German-born husband of Queen Beatrix. Although
he has lately resumed his official duties, he went to hospital in 1991 for a
recurrence of the depression for which he was treated in a Swiss clinic in
the early 1980s. He also has a mild form of Parkinson's disease.
Then again, Sweden's King Carl-Gustav is known to suffer from dyslexia. But
despite being married to the popular Queen Silvia, also German-born and a
graduate of the Munich interpreters' school, he is scarcely a hot topic, not
least because his duties these days do not even extend to opening
parliament.
Nevertheless the Dutch and the Swedish royals are controversial figures by
comparison with their counterparts in Germany, which hasn't had a monarch
since the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm after the First World War. The last
time the Kaiser's heirs caught public attention was four years ago, when one
of his great-nephews shot himself near an Austrian lake after finding his
wife dead from a drugs overdose.
All of which raises the question of whether, regardless of the Danes,
creeping Euro-harmonisation will eventually threaten the British royal
family with similar obscurity - and, if so, how the House of Windsor would
look on the prospect of dropping not just out of the headlines, but out of
the news altogether.
