FT  13 AUG 92 / Labour to oppose Scottish 'tap tax'
THE LABOUR PARTY yesterday promised to campaign vigorously against water
privatisation in Scotland.
It also challenged the government to explain why what it called the English
water 'disaster' should be extended northwards.
Mr Tom Clarke, shadow Scottish secretary, called on Mr Ian Lang, Scottish
secretary, to explain why further water privatisation did not appear in the
Conservative party's manifesto for the general election.
Mr Clarke said water privatisation had led to a 50 per cent increase in
bills, cost the country Pounds 7bn, resulted in nearly 1m court summonses
from private water companies and landed thousands of consumers in debt.
Water in Scotland is supplied by regional councils, whose future is
uncertain under local-government reorganisation.
Last week the government appointed an Edinburgh merchant bank as consultant
on the future of the industry, a move believed to foreshadow some degree of
privatisation.
Opposition parties say the 'tap tax', as they call it, is a political issue
that may meet a hostile reaction among even government supporters.
Mr Clarke said: 'With no hint of privatisation plans in the Tory manifesto
at the last election, and no arguments to be made for privatisation in the
light of the disastrous experience of privatisation in England and Wales, we
will argue there can be no case for a sell-off in Scotland.'
The Labour campaign will include demands that the government should
concentrate on making Scottish water cleaner and safer, 'not private and
more expensive'.
The government accused Labour of 'crying foul' long before a decision had
been taken. Sir Hector Monro, Scottish office minister, said Labour was
'scraping around' for an issue to unite warring factions within the party,
rather than addressing the real needs of the water industry.
