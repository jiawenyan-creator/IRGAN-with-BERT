  [Text] The final countdown has started for liftoff of 
Japan's next-generation H-2 rocket at Tanegashima Space Center 
in Kagoshima Prefecture on 1 February. The rocket is 50 meters 
long and 4 meters in diameter. It is a purely Japanese-made, 
practical large-scale rocket. 
  It is capable of launching a satellite of up to two tons, 
which is four times as heavy as past Japanese rockets. If 
everything goes well, the H-2 rocket will lift off four days 
from now -- at 0700 on 1 February.
