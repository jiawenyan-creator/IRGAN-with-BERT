FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Vickers close to revealing partner for
Rolls-Royce
Vickers, the engineering group, expects to announce a partnership around the
end of this year between its Rolls-Royce luxury cars business and another
leading motor manufacturer.
Its shares rose 4p to 183p, bringing the increase to 12 per cent over the
past fortnight. Companies speculatively linked with the UK group include the
German manufacturers Daimler-Benz and BMW.
Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers' chief executive, told investment managers
yesterday: 'Looking to the longer term for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, we all
accept that this business will need a partner. A partner who can bring
technology, components and support new models in the latter half of the
1990s.
'We expect steady growth in volumes and in particular I am confident we will
eventually see improvement in both the US and Japanese markets.
'We have an unrelenting programme to continue to improve efficiency at the
Crewe site. We will continue to produce new model variants, low-volume and
exclusive niche cars. This market can be expected to produce a significant
contribution to the overall business performance in the next few years.'
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars recently announced that sales were 2.2 per cent ahead
at 1,051 vehicles in the third quarter and said this kept it on course for a
successful last quarter.
