SUMMARY: 

Under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, PL 92463, EPA gives notice of a one-day meeting of the Information Resources
Management (IRM) Strategic Planning Task Force. The IRM Task Force is a special task force formed under the Environmental
Information and Assessment (EIA) Committee, which is one of the standing committees of the National Advisory Council
for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT). NACEPT provides advice and recommendations to the Administrator
of EPA on a broad range of environmental policy issues, and the EIA Committee examines issues associated with the gathering,
dissemination, and use of environmentally related data and information.



The IRM Task Force was formed to provide recommendations on key elements that EPA should include in an Information
Resources Management Strategic Plan for the Agency. The meeting is being held to discuss issues associated with implementing
the recommendations in the final report of the Task Force.


Scheduling constraints preclude oral comments from the public during the meeting. Written comments can be submitted
by mail, and will be transmitted to Task Force members for consideration.
