P.M. BRIEFING; 
BLOOMINGDALE'S STILL FOR SALE 
Campeau Corp. denied a published report today that it had changed its mind 
about selling Bloomingdale's, its flagship New York department store chain. 
"It's unfounded," Campeau spokeswoman Carol Sanger said of an article in 
Britain's Financial Times that reported the Canadian retailer had abandoned its 
attempts to sell the prestigious Bloomingdale's because of the inadequate level 
of offers received. 
"There's been no change" in Bloomingdale's status, Sanger said. 
Campeau put Bloomingdale's up for sale more than three months ago to ease the 
parent company's cash crunch and expected it to fetch up to $1.5 billion. 
Campeau bought the department store chain two years ago.
