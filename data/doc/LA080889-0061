CENTRAL BANK FORECASTS 5.1% GROWTH FOR JAPAN 
The Japanese economy is estimated to grow a net 5.1% in fiscal 1989, which ends 
next March 31, boosted by brisk capital investment and personal spending, a 
senior official of the Bank of Japan said. 
"The economy is likely to continue to be energetic at least until next spring," 
Tatsuya Tamura, director of the central bank's Economic Research and Statistics 
Department, told reporters. 
Tamura based his prediction on healthy capital investment and individual 
consumption. 
The government has projected this year's economic growth at 4%.
