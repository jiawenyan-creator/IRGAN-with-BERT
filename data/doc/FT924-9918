FT  03 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: BCI to issue CDs to help
widen funding flexibility
BANCA Commerciale Italiana (BCI), one of Italy's leading banks, is launching
a Certificate of Deposit programme worth up to Dollars 1bn on the US market
in a further widening of its borrowing options.
The CDs, issued by BCI's New York branch, will be in either 'senior' or
'subordinated' form and can be in a variety of currencies.
Maturities on the paper, to be issued in either fixed or floating-rate form,
will be up to 30 years.
The latest deal resembles the highly flexible Dollars 750m Euro-depositary
receipt programme the bank inaugurated in March, which involved maturities
of between three months and 30 years and a variety of currencies.
The new transaction, organised by Merrill Lynch, has four leading US
investment banks as agents.
