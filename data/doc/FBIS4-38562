  [Text] Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has said that he 
deeply regrets that the United States linked aid to Turkey to 
certain conditions. We do not consider this a friendly act, he 
said. 
  Demirel who is on an official visit to Ukraine, was asked by 
a journalist whether this U.S. move had anything to do with the 
fact that the National Security Council did not discuss the 
Poised Hammer issue. Demirel replied: Naturally, we deeply 
regret the United States linking aid to Turkey to human rights, 
terrorism, and the Cyprus issue. We do not consider this a 
friendly act. 
  Demirel pointed out that it is natural to struggle when 
faced 
with such developments, and that the Poised Hammer cannot be 
discussed under such conditions. He stressed that the National 
Security Council did not discuss the Poised Hammer, whose 
mandate will end at the end of this month.
