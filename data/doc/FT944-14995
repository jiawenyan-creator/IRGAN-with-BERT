FT  20 OCT 94 / Probe urged into alleged payments to Tory MPs
The government was last night urged to investigate fresh allegations of
'sleaze' after reports connecting two more Tory MPs with 'cash for
questions' payments.
The allegations, published in today's Guardian newspaper, concern Mr Neil
Hamilton, the trade and industry minister, and Mr Tim Smith, the Northern
Ireland minister.
Mr Stuart Bell, a Labour trade and industry spokesman, said in the Commons
that, according to the report, a leading parliamentary lobbyist was paid
thousands of pounds for parliamentary questions to be tabled by the two men
at Pounds 2,000 a time.
The questions were about the takeover of Harrods, the London department
store, and were reported to have been tabled in the late 1980s at the height
of the battle between Lonrho and the House of Fraser. Mr Hamilton and Mr
Smith were backbench MPs at the time.
Mr Bell added: 'They were both named in the article as recipients of
payments passed to Ian Greer Associates by Mohammed al-Fayed, the owner of
Harrods, on top of Pounds 50,000 on a parliamentary lobbying campaign.'
He called for an urgent statement from the prime minister on the report.
Mr Hamilton could not be reached for comment last night. The Northern
Ireland Office said Mr Smith had no comment. A Downing Street spokesman
declined to make any immediate comment on the accusations.
The report came as a parliamentary inquiry into allegations that Tory MPs Mr
Graham Riddick and Mr David Tredinnick accepted payment for tabling
parliamentary questions was thrown into chaos after seven Labour MPs
withdrew because it is not to be be held in public.
Meanwhile, another powerful committee of MPs decided not to investigate
allegations that Mr Mark Thatcher, the son of the former prime minister,
received Pounds 12m in commission from an arms deal negotiated by the
British government in the 1980s.
