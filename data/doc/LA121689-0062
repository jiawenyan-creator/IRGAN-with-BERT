GIFT SUGGESTION 
Red Cross Blood Services officials are sounding a call for volunteers willing 
to make holiday donations of blood so that an adequate supply can be assured 
through the always-critical period from Christmas to early January. 
The San Francisco earthquake brought an extraordinary response in Los Angeles 
and Orange counties, with donations about 7,000 units above normal. As a 
result, the local Red Cross has a 10-day supply on hand just before Christmas. 
This contrasts with the crisis last year when there was only a one-day supply 
and some surgeries had to be canceled. It is to avoid a repetition of that 
problem, and to overcome the usual slackening of donations over the holidays, 
that the appeal has been sounded for donations Dec. 26 through Jan. 6. 
Volunteers may arrange appointments at a donor center or bloodmobile near their 
home by calling (213) 739-5290 for Los Angeles County or (714) 835-5381 for 
Orange County.
