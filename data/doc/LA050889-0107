5 POLITICIANS DIE IN CRASH OF SWEDISH PLANE 
A small commuter plane crashed and exploded as it landed at a coastal airport 
today, killing all 16 people on board, including five Swedish politicians. 
The twin-engine Beechcraft 99 was on a regular flight from Stockholm's 
international Arlanda airport to this coastal town 150 miles south of Stockholm 
when it crashed. 
Radio Sweden said most of the 14 passengers were part of an official delegation 
due on a visit to Osckarshamn, which houses Sweden's largest nuclear power 
plant. 
Among those aboard were three members of Parliament, Anna-Greta Wohlin, Anders 
Andersson and Hans Rosengren, former legislator Klas Renfeldt and the former 
Stockholm party boss of the governing Social Democrats, John-Olle Persson, the 
radio reported.
