  [Text] Moscow, March 17 KYODO -- Russian Security Ministry 
troops on Wednesday [16 March] night forcefully took away the 
former mayor of Vladivostok from his office in the municipal 
government building, Russian prosecutors said Thursday. 
  The ex-mayor Viktor Cherepkov was dismissed for alleged 
bribery, but had rejected to leave the office. 
  ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY earlier reported that Security 
Ministry 
troops had detained the mayor after taking over his office. 
  Cherepkov was indicted last month on a charge of taking a 3 
million ruble payoff and an Omega wristwatch in exchange for 
providing favors to a man who was planning to increase business 
interests in the port city, said the prosecutors for the Russian 
Far East Maritime Region. 
  Cherepkov has persistently denied the charge of wrongdoing. 
  Following the indictment, he was stripped of his position 
until a Russian court hands down a ruling on the case. 
  During the one-month period, Cherepkov has defied the orders 
of a local court and prosecutors to vacate his office, and the 
purpose of the raid was to force him out, the prosecutors said. 
  The troops also dispersed many of Cherepkov's supporters who 
had gathered at the municipal government building, apparently 
fearing that security forces might try to break in.
