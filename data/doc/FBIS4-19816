  [Text] Cologne (DPA) -- The Federation of German Industry 
(BDI) expects economic development to revive this year but it 
also expects the number of working people to decline sharply. 
This is said in the economic report of the top association from 
Cologne, published on Wednesday [20 April]. According to the 
BDI's assessment, in the course of the year domestic demand will 
not expand to any degree worth mentioning, but expectations of a 
further speedy improvement in exports are certainly justified. 
  The trend toward a certain increase in stocks, which can be 
seen everywhere now, supports cautious optimism. Prospects for 
a strong stimulation of the economic development, however, 
remain limited. 
  Even if the economic development is favorable, the reduction 
of unemployment in western and eastern Germany will remain "the 
outstanding economic policy problem of the next few years," 
according to the BDI economic report. It is inconceivable that 
this problem will be overcome without a strong increase in 
investment, the report says. 
  According to this top industrial association, the growth 
process in the new laender has accelerated. The increase in 
domestic demand for industrial goods has improved tangibly and 
is spreading to an ever larger number of branches.
