FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Milan SE appoints first
director-general
THE MILAN stock exchange has appointed its first full-time managing
executive to oversee operations as a further step in its gradual
modernisation and reorganisation.
Mr Benito Boschetto, formerly secretary-general of Milan's chamber of
commerce, is to be the stock exchange's first director-general, answering to
the recently-created council formally responsible for running the market.
The appointment marks a further gradual reinforcement of the market as an
independent entity, rather than just a trading floor loosely run by
stockbrokers.
Italian equity trading has been thoroughly overhauled over the past three
years. The changes have seen the virtual disappearance of small,
undercapitalised stockbrokers and the creation of stronger and transparent
broking companies.
The reforms have also affected the organisational structure of the bourse,
which used to be run by a committee of leading private stockbrokers.
Although independent brokers are still represented on the new council,
created last December, the body comprises a much broader spectrum of market
participants, including the big banks.
