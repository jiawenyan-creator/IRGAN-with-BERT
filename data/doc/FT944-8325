FT  21 NOV 94 / Blair presses worker rights
Individual workers must be empowered with a minimum legal framework of
rights if they are to survive and prosper in the flexible labour market, Mr
Tony Blair told a trade union conference at the weekend.
The Labour party leader, outlining the future relationship between a Labour
government and the unions, said governments 'cannot and should not do it
all'.
He added: 'It is up to the trade unions themselves to take advantage of the
opportunities.
'They have a responsibility to adapt to the new circumstances and
realities.'
He said that unions had to speak up as effectively for part-time female
workers as they did for the full-time male worker. Such part-time women
would be a growing feature of the increasingly flexible labour market.
Mr Blair said there was 'a bond of belief' between Labour and the trade
unions that was 'more than a few lines in a rule book'.
He added: 'Unions know and accept that from a Labour government they can
expect fairness not favours. But fairness will be a big advance on the open
hostility they have had from governments over the past 15 years.'
Mr Blair praised the UCW postal union for its campaign which helped defeat
the government's Post Office privatisation plans.
He also praised the GMB general union for securing a European works council
at United Biscuits. He said this had made 'a mockery of the government's
opt-out from the social chapter'.
