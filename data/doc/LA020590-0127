NAMES IN THE NEWS; 
REPORTER, 10, GETS CRUISE SCOOP 
Ten-year-old Sarah Lawing went where no other journalist had gone before in 
obtaining an interview with Tom Cruise on the set of "Day of Thunder," his new 
movie about a race car driver. 
When she heard that Cruise was filming the movie near her family's farm in Long 
Creek, N.C., the reporter for Long Creek Elementary School's News and Neighs 
wrote the actor seeking an interview, according to this week's People magazine. 
The star of "Born on the Fourth of July," "Rain Man" and "Top Gun" had turned 
down previous requests but gave Sarah her first interview. Her only previous 
story, about "a really big snowflake," had not required an interview. 
During the five-minute interview, Cruise said he first became interested in 
acting at age 7 and said he thought "very strongly" about living in Long Creek 
in southwestern North Carolina.
