  [Excerpts] As you heard in our recent newscast, the entire 
Bugesera area is currently in the hands of the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF]. Only Ngenda commune had previously remained, but 
it was captured yesterday. [passage omitted] It is in Ngenda 
that the Rwabayanga pit was found. News reached us saying that 
Rwabayanga was full of dead bodies. However, in Ngeda, the RPF 
was able to rescue people who were still hiding. Those 
government troops which are still fighting, those who had 
survived, fled yesterday to Muyira Commune in Butare. 
  However, government troops continue to damage the public 
infrastructure. The troops left after demolishing the Rwabusoro 
Bridge. This is a big bridge which links Ngenda Commune in 
Bugesera to Muyira Commune in Butare. The RPF is trying to 
rebuild the bridge, but those familiar with it say that it will 
not be easy. It is said that the Rwabusoro [words indistinct] 
and it took four years to build the bridge. [passage omitted]
