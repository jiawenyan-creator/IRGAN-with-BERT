RIGHT TO WORK 
The members of Los Amigos observed with interest Laguna Beach Mayor Robert F. 
Gentry's recent statements supporting the rights of all people to seek gainful 
employment. We are specifically referring to his view that people are first of 
all human beings and should be treated in a just and humane manner, whatever 
their color or national origin. 
Gentry's candor and public openness is a hopeful sign to those of us who view 
with disgust the use of plainclothes police officers to entrap and arrest 
people whose only "crime" is the desire to find work so they can feed 
themselves. It is hoped that other mayors will use the Laguna Beach approach to 
the problem of day laborers rather than follow the model established north of 
Laguna Beach. 
The desire of people all over the world to come to the United States of America 
is nothing new to us, but it is not without its accompanying problems. Since 
most all of us have immigrant heritage, we should all be more understanding of 
this latest surge of immigration and seek to find humane solutions to the 
problems that develop from it. 
It seems to us to be morally right to treat all people first as human beings 
and then seek humane and just ways to deal with other issues. We teach these 
new entrants into the "American Dream" what liberty and justice for all means 
by the way we implement these principles in our political practices.
