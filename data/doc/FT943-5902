FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Financial items boost Skanska
Skanska, the Swedish construction and property group, yesterday reported a
30 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits to SKr1.52bn (Dollars 196m).
The rise came in spite of a weaker Swedish construction market and was
achieved due to lower net interest costs, reduced exchange losses on loans
and increased income from dividends.
Operating profit before financial items was SKr1.32bn, after including a
SKr234m gain on the sale of investment and development properties. The
figure was 7 per cent lower than a year ago when operating profits of
SKr1.43bn included a SKr37m gain from property sales.
The group has already exceeded the SKr1.12bn profit it reported for the
whole of 1993. Its second-half figures will include SKr880m in revenues
following the winding-up of Protorp, the investment company.
Revenues climbed to SKr14.9bn from SKr14bn. However, the group relied on a
strong expansion of its international construction business, where revenues
climbed to SKr3.9bn from SKr2.4bn, to offset the downturn in domestic
construction, where revenues fell to SKr6.7bn from SKr7.4bn.
