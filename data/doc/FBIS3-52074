  [Text] (DYN) -- The province of Corrientes will only ratify 
the fiscal pact if the government reschedules its 600 million 
dollar debt, Governor Raul Romero Feris said yesterday. 
  The governor added that the issue will be decided, one way 
or 
the other, when a reply is received from the government on 
Wednesday. 
  Yesterday afternoon Romero Feris held a meeting in 
Government 
House with Presidential Chief of Staff Eduardo Bauza and Economy 
Secretary Ricardo Gutierrez, who have scheduled a new meeting to 
take place when Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo returns from 
the economic summit in Switzerland. 
  The governor pointed out that signing the fiscal pact, with 
the consequent abolishment of the gross income tax, means a loss 
of some four million pesos a month to the province until 
alternative revenue-generating measures can be implemented. 
  The former federal trustee in Corrientes Ideler Tonelli had 
signed the fiscal pact last year but the measures has to be 
approved by the provincial officials who took office on 10 
December. 
  Although Romero Feris said that the government was showing a 
"favourable attitude" he warned that if solutions aren't found 
soon social issues in Corrientes could become troublesome.
