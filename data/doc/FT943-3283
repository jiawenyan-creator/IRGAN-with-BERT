FT  15 SEP 94 / Germany can keep PCP ban
Germany can continue its ban on pentachlorophenol (PCP), the disinfectant
used for wood preservation and textile treatment, the European Commission
said yesterday. The ruling will appeal to ecology-conscious Sweden, which is
about to hold a referendum on EU membership. It means countries can apply
higher environmental standards than their EU partners in selective areas,
despite the general requirement for harmonisation in the internal market.
Last May, the European Court of Justice declared void the original
Commission decision to uphold Germany's PCP ban. Yesterday, the Commission
justified its second decision by referring to unusually high PCP levels in
Germany.
