FT  16 MAR 92 / Construction Contracts: Providing services for M25
MOSS CONSTRUCTION SOUTHERN has been awarded a Pounds 13.2m contract to
design and construct the first motorway service areas on the southern
section of the M25 motorway for RoadChef.
The site is located at Clackett's Lane, on the Kent - Surrey border, between
junctions five and six near Westerham. It spans both sides of the motorway
and will be the largest service project on the motorway network. The project
will create over 350 full-time jobs.
The design, management and co-ordination of the contract will be handled by
Moss Construction operating from Cheltenham, while the on-site construction
programme, scheduled for completion in 15 months, will be undertaken by
Wallis, based at Bromley.
Both Moss and Wallis are part of the regional construction network of the
CHB Group.
RoadChef's contract to develop and operate the Clackett Lane services was
awarded last year.
