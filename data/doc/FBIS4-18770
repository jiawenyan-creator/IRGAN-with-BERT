  [Text] Umberto Bossi went to Pontida to face tens of 
thousands of Northern League supporters, perhaps as many as 
50,000. Silvio Berlusconi, on the other hand, went to Rome 
where he attended the congress of Marco Pannella's Reform Party. 
Once again this Sunday has been full of political issues 
dominated by the two major partners in the Freedom Alliance, who 
along with Gianfranco Fini's National Alliance, should give us a 
government following the vote that took place on 27 and 28 March. 
  Bossi confirmed that the Northern League would be part of 
the 
next government, but he laid down certain conditions: 
federalism, the free market, and antitrust laws to take power 
away from the partiocratic state and from the elite business 
dynasties. These conditions are called the Pact of Pontida and 
were pledged by the 181 Northern League parliamentarians. Bossi 
warned that if things do not change within the space of six 
months, the League would leave the government and northern Italy 
would go it alone. 
  Now we turn to Rome, where Silvio Berlusconi took the 
opportunity of stressing that the Alliance that won the 
elections was not right-wing but centrist. The leader of Forza 
Italia undertook to become the messenger of good sense and good 
government and to steer the Alliance towards the center. He 
said that he wanted an efficient government supported by a 
working majority. He also called for the reform of the 
electoral system with single member constituencies being 
contested in one round with a first-past-the-post system. 
Berlusconi called for the abolition of the proportional 
percentage of seat allocations.
