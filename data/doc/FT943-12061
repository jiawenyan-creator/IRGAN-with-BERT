FT  27 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Gencor/Shell
Gencor has been trying to buy Royal Dutch/Shell's mining interests for over
a year, so it is a relief that a deal has finally been struck. Untangling
the web of pre-emption rights surrounding assets held in joint ventures has
been the main sticking point. Shell has also had to supply Dollars 300m of
low-cost finance to get the deal away. It is a measure of the forces driving
both sides that these problems have been overcome. Gencor badly wanted a
deal which would propel it into the top tier of international mining
companies. Shell has realised what BP acknowledged back in 1989: that oil
companies bring nothing to mining.
The question is whether yesterday's deal will do for Gencor what the
acquisition of BP Minerals did for RTZ. Much turns on commodity prices.
While RTZ took a gamble on the copper price and won, Gencor is placing a
similar bet on aluminium. Since it is buying near the bottom of the
commodities cycle, the odds appear to be heavily stacked in Gencor's favour.
While there are risks of a price correction, the recovery trend is clear.
Integrating its new mining assets with aluminium smelting and stainless
steel manufacture in South Africa should also bring benefits.
It is not clear that Gencor's big step on to the international scene will be
enough to entice foreign fund managers. Complex cross-holdings, poor
liquidity and the cumbersome mechanism of the financial rand are all reasons
for international funds to steer clear. If these barriers come down, though,
Gencor may have just lifted itself towards the top of the shopping list.
