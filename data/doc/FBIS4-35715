Negotiating With Israel"] 
  [Excerpt] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- 
Well-informed sources in Tehran emphasized yesterday that Syria 
has informed Iran of its intention to enter into "fundamental 
negotiations that could lead to a peaceful settlement with 
Israel." 
  Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Nateq-Nuri, who was reelected yesterday 
as speaker of the Iranian Majles, said that his country has been 
informed of Syria's plans in this connection, "and we know the 
motive behind its choice of this course." Nuri pointed out that 
signing a peace treaty with Israel would be a "grave mistake" by 
Syria and could "harm its reputation." However, he stressed 
that that "would not lead to the severance of diplomatic 
relations between Tehran and Damascus." 
  Analysts describe Nateq-Nuri's remarks about the Syrian 
position as the beginning of a marked transformation in Iranian 
policy. [passage omitted]
