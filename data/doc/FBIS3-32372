<F P=106> [Report by William Cespedes from the Presidential Palace; </F>
from the "Radio Reloj Newscast;" -- live] 
  [Text] President Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier says that 
satisfactory progress is being made in negotiations with Mexico 
for a free trade agreement. Yesterday afternoon Calderon talked 
with his Mexican colleague Carlos Salinas de Gortari on the 
phone. We need to tie up certain aspects related to the field 
of agriculture, even though President Calderon says that both 
Mexico and Costa Rica have partially yielded to arrive at an 
agreement, which should be the case in any negotiation. 
  The sugar topic was resolved at the beginning of the week. 
There have also been agreements on the topic of meat, which 
only leaves pending dairy products and derivatives as well as 
other agricultural products of great demand in the Mexican 
market. President Calderon added: 
  [Begin recording] [Calderon] All this is very important in 
our negotiations with Mexico. I had the opportunity to talk 
with President Salinas; he in turn spoke to his minister. I did 
the same with [Economy and Industry] Minister [Roberto] Rojas. 
Thus, any minor differences that could possibly remain, 
especially with industrial products, could be solved if we all 
give in a little. 
  Minister Rojas feels very optimistic. He has scheduled the 
last work session with Don Jaime Serra Puche, Mexican commerce 
and industrial development secretary, for 14 February -- the 
last meeting at the ministerial level. We expect white smoke to 
emerge and enable us to announce a new treaty. 
  The topic of agriculture, which is being studied by the 
deputy agriculture ministers, is pending. Our deputy 
agriculture minister was in Mexico. I am waiting for a meeting 
next week between [Agriculture and Livestock] Minister [Juan] 
Lizano and Professor [Carlos] Hank Gonzalez, Mexican agriculture 
and hydraulic resources secretary, to reach a final agreement on 
the topic of agriculture. I feel very optimistic. I believe 
that we have now moved ahead substantially and it is very 
possible that we can have the draft ready in February. 
  [Cespedes] In what specific areas in the industrial field 
did 
Costa Rica give in? 
  [Calderon] No, it is not that we gave in. Well, all of us 
have yielded a little. Since formal talks began three years ago 
both Mexico and Costa Rica have yielded a bit from their 
original stance. This is normal for any negotiation between two 
sides. If both sides had chosen to remain inflexible, we would 
have never been able to reach an agreement. 
  [Cespedes] [question indistinct] 
  [Calderon] This is precisely where a very satisfactory 
formula has emerged; we are just waiting for Mexico to ratify it. 
  [Cespedes] What is the formula? The meat topic? 
  [Calderon] The sugar topic is practically resolved. This 
leaves only the meat and dairy products. The reports I have 
seem to indicate that the meat topic is practically resolved. 
Anyway, these are the details that I am precisely expecting to 
receive from the agriculture minister with an updated report. 
[end recording] 
  President Calderon expects to sign the free trade agreement 
with Mexico before the end of March. This treaty will allow 
Costa Rica to penetrate a market of 90 million inhabitants where 
most Costa Rican agricultural products are very well accepted 
and are much in demand, which will in turn benefit the Costa 
Rican economy.
