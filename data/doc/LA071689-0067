ABSENTEE OWNERS, NEGLECTED HOMES 
A sad change is rapidly spreading throughout my hometown of Arcadia, a "City of 
Homes." 
I'm not referring to the ostentatious, overbuilt, $1 million-plus houses that 
have been popping up here like giant, gaudy mushrooms, but to the increasing 
number of vacant, uncared-for homes that have evidently been bought for 
speculation by absentee owners. 
Some of these are obviously cared for: plants watered, lawns mowed and papers 
picked up. Many others are left to decay, month after month, while papers pile 
up, lawns and even trees die, and waist-high weeds take over otherwise withered 
yards. These eyesores can be found on street after street, looking worse and 
worse as the months pass and the weeds grow. 
Is our city alone with this blight? Why aren't these absentee owners made to 
tidy up . . . and keep up? 
Seems we've gone from being a gracious "City of Homes" to a growing "Ghetto of 
Vacant Houses."
