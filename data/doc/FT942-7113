FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Founders cede control of French
advertising firm
Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit (BDDP), the French advertising group, yesterday ended
a long struggle to retain its independence. Its four founders announced they
were ceding control of the company to a consortium of institutional
investors in a FFr700m (Dollars 124.1m) rescue package.
BDDP, which has expanded rapidly to become one of France's largest
advertising agencies since its creation 10 years ago, has come under intense
pressure during the recession. It has been searching for capital to reduce
its debt for some time.
The deal means the four founders, led by Mr Jean-Claude Boulet, chairman,
will now own 15 per cent of the group, rather than their current combined
share of 55 per cent. The rest of the equity will be divided between ESI, an
investment fund, and a group of banks including Banque Nationale de Paris
and Credit Lyonnais.
After the restructuring, BDDP's debt will be reduced to FFr300m from FFr1bn.
