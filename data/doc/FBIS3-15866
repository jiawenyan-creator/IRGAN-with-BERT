  [Text] Riga, Mar 08, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima 
(parliament) Defense and Interior Affairs' Committee discussed 
Tuesday [8 March] compensations for families whose supporters 
have perished during the mandatory armed service in the former 
Soviet army. 
  Around 200 such families need material assistance in Latvia, 
according to figures at the disposal of the committee. 
  The committee decided to send the collected files for 
Cabinet 
consideration, said its secretary Anita Stankevica. 
  The necessary funding could be demanded from Russia during 
bilateral talks or the Latvian Government could allot the money 
from the state budget, the committee said. 
  The future task of the committee is to gather information 
about people who were crippled while in the Soviet Army. Then, 
the group will contact assistance funds in Germany which offer 
financial help to Latvian citizens disabled in the Soviet Army.
