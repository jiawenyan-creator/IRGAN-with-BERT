FT  22 DEC 93 / Greece's constitutional study fails to impress
Greece yesterday proposed setting up a committee of 'wise men' to study a
future European constitution when it takes over the presidency of the
European Union in the New Year, but the plan met a cool response.
Britain, France and Germany yesterday all expressed polite reservations
about the idea floated in Brussels by Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greek minister
for European affairs.
The idea of opening up a 'post-Maastricht debate' on the future of the EU
has been circulating recently, driven partly by fears that the 12-strong
Union could become unwieldy if it takes in Austria, Finland, Sweden and
Norway.
Mr Pangalos, an outspoken Greek socialist, said his idea of a high-powered
independent group of constitutional experts was modelled on the 'Dooge
committee', which paved the way for the 1985 Single European Act creating an
integrated market by 1992.
He added that he was frustrated by recent debate about the institutional
impact of enlargement, because it focused on secondary issues such as the
number of European Commissioners and the balance of voting power between
large and small states.
He suggested that the committee could produce a report for heads of
government at the European summit in Corfu in June, well in advance of the
scheduled 1996 conference which will review Maastricht. 'It is better to
have talks about institutional questions now rather than have the question
rise up continually like the Loch Ness Monster,' he said.
Greece takes over the EU presidency on January 1.
