FT  18 FEB 93 / Unemployment in the UK: A scar that will persist for years
to come - Britain faces the certainty of 3m unemployed. If the figure is not
reached today, it soon will be. More chilling is the fact that the total
will remain high after economic recovery
IF unemployment does not pass 3m in today's headline figures it will next
month. The prospect of another year of sluggish growth means the jobless
total will grow well into next year.
Yet the attention-grabbing fall and rise in the level of unemployment over
the last few years obscures the more chilling feature of Britain's record:
the rising level of unemployment that persists whether the economy is in
recession or growing fast.
While the pace and timing of the recovery is hotly disputed, no City
economists expects unemployment to return to pre-1970s days when fewer than
1m were out of work:
Optimists such as Mr Kevin Gardiner at SG Warburg Securities expect
unemployment to peak at 3.2m in the fourth quarter of this year and to fall
below 3m in early 1995.
Pessimists such as Mr Gerard Lyons of DKB International expect a sickly
recovery to push unemployment to a peak of 3.6m in 1995 and keep it above 3m
throughout the next decade. Either way painfully high unemployment levels
are here to stay for years.
Why is the underlying level of unemployment so much higher today than 20
years ago? Britain's repeated rollercoaster rides between boom and recession
make it tempting to blame government mismanagement for persistently high
unemployment, especially after three wrenching recessions in fewer than two
decades.
But while the UK has had much deeper recessions than its European
counterparts, it is not alone in being dogged by persistently high and
rising unemployment, even though the rise in continental European
unemployment may have occurred less spasmodically.
Britain's unemployment rate has risen by more than that in any other member
of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries over the past two
years.
However,a the rate started rising from a lower level than in most of the
country's European counterparts, and is even now barely above that in
recession-bound France.
The standard explanations for persistently high unemployment - powerful
trade unions, generous unemployment benefits or an immobile workforce - do
not fit well with Britain's 1980s experience.
The Thatcher government deregulated the labour market, making it easier to
hire and fire workers, and encouraged a large rise in female employment; it
saw trade union membership fall and the number of strikes decline; it cut
the level of unemployment benefits relative to average wages; and more
workers than ever before bought their houses and moved between regions.
Yet at the peak of the late 1980s boom, when skilled and unskilled vacancies
across the country had recovered to their levels of the late 1970s,
unemployment remained higher than in any other post-war decade.
The explanation lies in the attributes and the aspirations of the unemployed
themselves. Technological change and competition from low-cost producers in
developing countries has reduced the demand for unskilled labour other than
in low wage, often part-time employment. These jobs, often in the service
sector, have been mainly taken by female entrants into the labour market.
Meanwhile, the demand for the services of unskilled men has collapsed, at
least at wages they are willing to accept. Most of the long-term unemployed
in the 1980s were male, lived and worked in the industrial heartlands of the
north of England and had no educational qualifications.
Many of these men have slipped off the unemployment count and are now
officially counted as economically inactive.
The mythology of the current recession suggests that this time round it is
architects, lawyers and other middle-class professionals in the south-east
who are suffering. But this a misleading caricature.
Like all myths, there is some element of truth behind it. Unemployment has
risen much faster in the south than in the north and has hit
mortgage-holders harder than people who live in rented accommodation.
Unemployment rates for professional workers have risen, while they barely
changed in the 1980-81 recession; and unemployment rates have risen for all
groups, regardless of educational qualifications. The fear of unemployment
among professional and indebted home-owners is also partly to blame for the
lack of recovery.
Yet the professions and service sectors have not taken the brunt of this
recession. Employment in service industries has fallen by a little under
500,000 since the recession began, but manufacturing employment has fallen
by over 700,000. The unemployment rate for people who worked in
manufacturing has risen by 5.8 percentage points since 1989 compared with
2.4 percentage points in banking and finance. Unemployment rates have risen
much faster for men and young people than women, and for people in unskilled
blue or white-collar occupations than professionals.
The recession is spreading the effect of falling demand for low skill labour
to the south and to the service sector. Even when recovery comes, many of
these lost jobs will only return at increasingly low wages. It is the poorly
educated, not the frightened middle classes, who will still be bearing the
brunt when this recession is just a painful memory.
