  [Text] Dushanbe January 8 TASS -- Tajik leader Imamali 
Rakhmanov has expressed concern over the intensified Afghan 
internal military and political conflicts in a letter sent on 
Friday to the U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. His 
concern is prompted by the fact that unrest in the neighbouring 
country has led to new aggravation of the situation on 
Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan. 
  The Tajik military point out that a new surge of tension on 
Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan is due to the deteriorating 
military and political situation in Afghanistan, where different 
groups are clashing also in the northern provinces bordering on 
Tajikistan. It is in these provinces that major Tajik armed 
opposition forces are concentrated. Taking advantage of the 
Afghan unrest, they have stepped up their own activity aimed at 
reaching their own ends. 
  According to military sources in Dushanbe, the current 
situation along parts of the border between Tajikistan and 
Afghanistan is increasingly tense because of such armed 
provocations by Tajik opposition forces acting from the Afghan 
territory. 
  Russian border guards early on Saturday suppressed one of 
the 
growing number of attempts by groups of opposition militants to 
cross the border from Afghanistan to Tajikistan towards Shaartuz 
in the Pyanj border guard detachment zone. 
  Military sources, however, say more attempts of this kind 
are 
likely to follow soon in the same zone. For this reason extra 
steps are being taken to prevent such attempts. Border troops 
are being reinforced in the area controlled by the 12th frontier 
post of the Moscow border guard detachment where armed 
provocations are on the rise too.
