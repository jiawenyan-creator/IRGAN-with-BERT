  [Text] The Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] is to 
establish its own radio station, possibly as early as the middle 
of next month. The Volksfront has recently bought 13 steel 
high- tension masts from Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission], 
which it will convert into radio transmission antennas. Its 
planned FM service will stretch from Hartbeesfontein in the 
western Transvaal, through the Orange Free State to 
Bloemfontein, and from there to Upington in the northern Cape. 
  In addition to Radio Pretoria, which is still broadcasting 
illegally, four radio transmitters were recently set up in the 
Orange Free State, and a fifth is being built in Bethlehem. 
According to an Eskom spokesman, the high-tension masts were 
purchased for 350 rands each, possibly at an auction or by 
tender.
