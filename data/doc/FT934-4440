FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Labels depress Tinsley Robor
Tinsley Robor, the printing and packaging group, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 12,000 for the six months to September 30, against losses of Pounds
132,000. For the full year to March 1993 the group returned to the black
with Pounds 15,000.
Ongoing losses at Howards Printers, the label printing subsidiary, continued
to depress group results, Mr John Rose, chairman, said. Elsewhere trading
continued at tight margins with volumes maintained but expected growth had
not materialised.
The new specialist music industry printing plant at Uden in the Netherlands,
completed its first orders in August, Mr Rose said. Start-up costs of Pounds
206,000 were included in the results.
Most of the Pounds 1.9m capital expenditure during the period related to the
Uden plant. Spending in the second half would be much reduced, he said.
Turnover grew from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 13.1m. Losses per share were cut
to 0.2p (0.4p).
