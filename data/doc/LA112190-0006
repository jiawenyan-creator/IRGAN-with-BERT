ACCIDENTS IN ANGELES FOREST 
This article really chaps my hide! Signs listing every possible danger? There 
is already a plethora of man-made signs, i.e., graffiti, trash and destruction 
of flora by boobs who should get their recreation in MacArthur Park or 
Disneyland. 
How about signs in really dangerous areas? Example: "Jogging in the freeway 
lanes may be injurious to your health." 
And get off the backs of the fine people of the Forest Service. In 30 years of 
hiking, picnicking and camping in the Angeles, I have found them to be helpful, 
friendly and dedicated. Dealing every day with willful destruction, druggies, 
drunks, speeders, illegal shooters, lack of funds and lack of personnel is no 
picnic.
