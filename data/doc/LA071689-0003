KTTV should be complimented for airing the funeral mass of Cardinal Timothy 
Manning live and without commercials on June 29. The ceremony was handled in a 
dignified and informative manner by the stations' commentators. Channel 11 did 
the Los Angeles community a fine public service by preempting its regular 
programming to air an important and affecting event.
