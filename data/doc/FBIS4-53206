  [Text] Moscow, May 17 (YONHAP) -- Among the North Korean 
loggers having escaped from their logging camps in Siberia, 
those wishing to come to South Korea are known to number about 
90. 
  A source at the South Korean Embassy here said on Tuesday 
the 
number was obtained in a careful study of the records of those 
loggers who have thus far expressed wishes to resettle in South 
Korea. 
  The source said, however, there is no way to know how many 
loggers had escaped Siberian logging camps to date as both 
Russia and North Korea do not disclose their number. 
  Meanwhile, another source said North Korea had asked Russia 
to arrest and hand over about 40 of escaped loggers under the 
Russia- North Korea legal assistance agreement. 
  Besides, North Korean secret agents in Russia and other CIS 
(Commonwealth of Independent States) countries have stepped up 
activities to search and apprehend escaped loggers since Seoul 
announced a plan to allow them to resettle in South Korea, the 
source said.
