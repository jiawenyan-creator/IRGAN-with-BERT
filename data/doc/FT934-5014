FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Performance-related pay changes
The chancellor put forward a number of changes to focus tax relief more
closely on schemes which encourage genuine PRP for a business' employees,
and to prevent its exploitation.
The chancellor proposes to make changes to two aspects of the tax relief for
PRP. Both will come into effect in relation to PRP schemes registered on or
after today.
The changes are:
To increase, in certain circumstances, the upper limit on profits which an
employer may disregard in calculating PRP; and also to ensure that that
limit is applied to a consistent measure of profits, taking one year with
another;
To ensure that PRP payable to employees in special schemes (PRP schemes for
particular units within a business) is not disproportionately greater than
PRP paid under other schemes to employees in the same business.
