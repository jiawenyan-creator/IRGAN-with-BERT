FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Intrum Justitia sees static result
Shares in Intrum Justitia, Europe's leading debt collector, yesterday fell
28p to close at 100p after warning that the declining value of Nordic
currencies and a delay in recovery in Switzerland would hit profits for this
year.
In September the group, based in the Netherlands and listed in London,
reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 6.81m to Pounds 7.47m for the six
months to June 30.
However, the group said annual profits after tax would be 'approximately the
same as for 1992, which is below current market expectations'.
Last year pre-tax profits were ahead 26 per cent at Pounds 16m. The final
dividend of 2p made a total for the year of 3p. The group still expects to
recommend an increase in the final dividend this year.
