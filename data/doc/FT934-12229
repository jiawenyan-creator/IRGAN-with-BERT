FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (3): The clouds
begin to lift - The banking industry is looking forward to a year of
recovery in 1995
NOW that the dust has settled after the successful privatisation of Banque
Nationale de Paris (BNP), the talking point in French banking circles has
moved back to that old favourite, Credit Lyonnais, and to how much longer
Jean-Yves Haberer can cling on to the chairmanship.
Mr Haberer has already hinted that he is on his way out. He recently
confirmed that he was considering the offer of another public sector post
which is rumoured to be the chairmanship of Credit National.
The favourite candidate to succeed him at Credit Lyonnais is Jean
Peyrelevade, now head of Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest
French insurance group.
The choice of Mr Peyrelevade looks suspiciously like a calculated piece of
political spite on the part of the centre-right Balladur government. Mr
Peyrelevade was a socialist appointee, but he is far too influential in
French financial circles for the government to fire him.
The chairmanship of one of France's biggest and most glamorous banks is too
prestigious a position to be refused, but it also involves the unenviable
task of tackling Credit Lyonnais' financial problems and hauling the bank
back into the black.
Luckily for Mr Peyrelevade, or for whoever else takes the helm, the worst
may well be over for Credit Lyonnais and its fellow French banks. The French
banking industry has had a tough two years due to the painful combination of
a sluggish credit market and the need to make hefty provisions on falling
property values and sour corporate loans.
The clouds are now lifting. The French economy is still in recession, the
credit market has yet to respond to the recent reductions in interest rates
and the corporate sector remains under intense pressure. But the situation
has stabilised and recovery is now in sight.
'I feel that we're at the bottom of the economic cycle,' said Michel
Pebereau, chairman of BNP. 'Our small corporate clients are less pessimistic
and there has been a slight improvement in the residential property market.
The economy ought to recover progressively from early next year.'
The revival of the banking sector is likely to lag a little behind the rest
of the economy. One catalyst for its recovery will be an upturn in demand
for credit, which should start to improve against the backdrop of the
Balladur government's steady reductions in interest rates. However the
trauma of the recession, the first in France since the mid-1970s oil shocks,
is likely to make companies cautious about borrowing money.
Consumers are in a similar state and are likely to remain nervous for as
long as the toll of job losses continues to rise.
'It will take time for confidence to recover both in the corporate sector
and among consumers,' said Sheila Garrard, European banking analyst at
Lehman Brothers in London. 'There is usually a time lag between the end of a
recession and a banking recovery. But this recession seemed to hit the
French banks very fast, so they may well recover quickly.'
The speed of the banks' recovery could be checked by the constant threat of
fresh competition from the French post office and other financial services
groups, notably the insurers. Conversely the banks should soon benefit from
the impact of the productivity progammes implemented in the early 1990s,
when they shed staff and invested in new technology.
However the main trigger for the banks' revival will be a reduction in the
high level of provisions they have had to make in recent years. Almost all
the banks faced heavy writedowns in 1992 because of the downturn in the
commercial property market and the steep increase in business failures among
smaller corporate clients.
Credit Lyonnais, which went into the red last year, has also been burdened
by its exposure to a string of corporate catastrophes such as the Maxwell
media empire and MGM, the stricken Hollywood film studio.
The property market has stabilised this year. But the rate of business
failures is still frighteningly high. Some banks, including BNP and Paribas,
have also faced writedowns on sovereign loans, although the provisioning
problem was mitigated in the first half because of the banks' windfall
trading profits on currency and equities.
Ms Garrard of Lehman Brothers expects the level of provisions to stabilise
next year and to return to 'a more normal level' next year. 'Investors have
already written off 1993 for the French banks and, according to recent
chairmen's statements, we can expect more of the same in 1994,' she said.
'But everyone expects 1995 to be a year of recovery.'
Meanwhile the banks are adopting a restrained approach on the strategic
front. Even Credit Lyonnais, which pursued an aggressive policy of lending
and international expansion under Mr Haberer in the late 1980s, sees the
mid-1990s as a period for consolidation.
The new chairman's top priorities will be to stabilise the group and repair
its balance sheet so that it is in a suitable state for privatisation.
Marc Vienot, chairman of Societe Generale, has made it clear that, although
he might expand the group's industrial banking activities, he favours
caution on the international front.
Paribas is still licking its wounds by cutting costs and slowly pruning out
peripheral interests after the trauma of its first-ever loss in 1991.
Meanwhile Mr Pebereau sees his strategy at BNP as evolutionary, rather than
revolutionary. His international plans centre on developing BNP's
partnership with Dresdner Bank of Germany. After BNP's privatisation the two
banks have been awaiting the European Commission's approval before
finalising the terms of their proposed share swap.
They may then, according to Mr Pebereau, consider linking up with other
European banks, albeit on a commercial basis, not through equity exchanges.
'We just couldn't go out and buy a bank in each country within the European
Community, it would be too costly and complicated,' he said. 'The Dresdner
agreement enables us to expand within Europe without getting involved with
dangerous and expensive investments.'
