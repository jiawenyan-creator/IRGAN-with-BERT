NEWPORT BEACH DUKES END TRIP BY FALLING TO THE STARS 
The Newport Beach Dukes won only one set and lost to the New Jersey Stars, 
26-16, Sunday in a Team Tennis match at Florham Park, N.J. 
The Dukes (5-2) took a lead in the first set of the match, when Amy Frazier and 
Sophie Amiach defeated Billie Jean King and Linda Harvey-Wild, 6-2, in women's 
doubles. 
The Stars (2-5) rallied first behind Harvey-Wild, who defeated Frazier, 6-5 
(5-3 in the tiebreaker). 
Frazier had not lost a set in six previous singles matches. John Sullivan and 
Shane Barr then beat Marty Davis and Roger Smith, 6-3, in men's doubles to tie 
the score at 14-14. 
It was the only loss of the Dukes' five-match Eastern trip, but Coach Greg 
Patton was disappointed it didn't end more successfully. "We can't afford to 
lose to the weaker teams," Patton said. "That team was 1-5, but they caught us 
at the right time."
