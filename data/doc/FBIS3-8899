  [Text] Warsaw, 17 Mar--Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] 
leader Aleksander Kwasniewski was asked today by "Radio Three" 
what he thinks about the alleged dilemma of the president, who 
appears to be thinking of whether or not to sign the budget as 
preelection promises have not been fulfilled. Kwasniewski 
replied that the "president, who on several occasions promised 
us various programs and failed to fulfill any, should show more 
patience in judging the implementation of programs by the 
four-month-old government." 
  "The president has more programs to explain after over three 
years in office," Kwasniewski added, at the same time calling 
for a renunciation of disputes and a search for a basis of 
cooperation between the government, the coalition, and the 
president. 
  The SLD leader also said that "by not signing the budget, 
the 
president will make Poland look ridiculous, especially in a 
situation in which we have an agreement signed with the London 
Club and in which the budget has helped us to win the necessary 
confidence of the world."
