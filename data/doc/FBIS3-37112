  [Text] Ankara February 11 TASS -- Armenia should leave 
Azeri lands without any conditions, Azerbaijani President Geydar 
Aliyev told a press conference in Istanbul on Friday. 
  The Azerbaijani leader said that "some states and groups" 
render a material and moral support to Armenia. "This makes the 
fight to liberate our territory tougher," Aliyev stressed. 
"Azerbaijan seeks to resolve the problem by peaceful means, but 
Armenia wants to resolve it by force and bring Azerbaijan to the 
knees," the Azerbaijani president noted. 
  Azerbaijan did not request Turkey to render military 
assistance. The two sides agreed about "supplies of wheat and 
granting of credits, as well as capital investments in the 
economy of Azerbaijan," Aliyev emphasised said. 
  The Azerbaijani leader noted that Azerbaijan itself will 
resolve military questions, but would like to "take advantage of 
prestigious military academies in Turkey to train experienced 
officers for the Azeri Army." The president said that his visit 
to Turkey was "very useful" from the point of view of the 
development of "friendly and fraternal relations" with the 
Turkish Republic. 
  Geydar Aliyev is expected to leave Turkey on Friday.
