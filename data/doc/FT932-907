FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: BfG sees break-even despite debt
provisions
BfG BANK, the German bank which is majority-owned by Credit Lyonnais of
France, predicted yesterday that it would break even for the year after
making provisions for bad and doubtful corporate and sovereign lending.
This would be the first time in years that the bank would be able to achieve
such a result, having been burdened since the late 1980s by high provisions
against eastern bloc loans, by exposure to problem company loans and more
recently by the costs of rationalisation, according to Mr Paul Wieandt,
chief executive.
As previously reported, total losses last year amounted to a net DM1.15bn
(Dollars 679m), while operating profits were DM187m after DM144m in the
previous year.
Mr Wieandt said that total profits for the first half of the current year
had risen by 11 per cent against the comparable period last year.
He said he hoped the positive trend would continue in the rest of the year
and was confident of controlling bad debts despite the deterioration in the
economic climate.
