THE SIDELINES; 
JAPAN DEFEATS U.S. GOLF SQUAD 
Pat Moore of North Carolina fought to a 70-70 tie with Japan's Shigeyuki 
Maruyama today, but Japan beat the U.S. team by six points in the JAL 
NCAA-Japan Collegiate Golf Championships. 
It was Japan's third title since the series began in 1975. 
Breaking an 18-18 tie after two rounds, Japan won seven of the 12 final-day 
matches for a final score of 33-27. A victory was worth two points and a tie 
one. 
Maruyama of Nihon University, the Beijing Asian Games gold medalist, took the 
men's individual honors with a three-round total of 209.
