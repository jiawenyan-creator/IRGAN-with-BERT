  [Text] Following the vote on defense funding, [Defense 
Minister] Janez Jansa in his function as president of the Social 
Democratic Party sent an open letter to Dr. Janez Drnovsek, 
prime minister and president of the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDS], in which he points out the violation of the principles 
and provisions of the coalition agreement. 
  In the letter he informs Dr. Drnovsek that during his visit 
to the South African Republic, LDS deputy Janez Kopac announced 
his opposition to the government amendment that increased the 
so-called Defense Tolar, and that defense funds have been capped 
by 6 billion tolars, which allowed the budget to remain within 
the limits outlined in the budget memorandum. 
  Jansa warns that the Social Democratic Party, besides some 
social demands, also made its support for the budget conditional 
on the passing of government amendments. The parliamentary 
decision -- enclosed with the letter is a computer printout of 
the vote -- in his words directly influences state's safety, 
social development, and the pace of drawing closer to the 
European Union and NATO. 
  On behalf of the Social Democratic Party, Jansa therefore 
asks Drnovsek whether the coalition agreement is still valid, 
that is to say, whether the LDS will propose changes. He also 
asks whether the coalition will withdraw the 1994 budget 
proposal and start a new coordination round or whether the 
entire procedure was merely a farce aimed at reducing defense 
funds as much as possible. He also asks Drnovsek about future 
measures to secure at least relatively normal functioning of the 
coalition. At the same time Jansa asks him to convene a meeting 
of all the coalition partner leaders as soon as possible.
