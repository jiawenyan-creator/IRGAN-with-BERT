FT  24 MAY 93 / Israel jobs move for Palestinians
THE Israeli cabinet yesterday allocated 30m shekels (Pounds 7m) to create
20,000 jobs in the occupied territories for Palestinians barred from
entering Israel since the closure order was issued almost two months ago,
writes our Jerusalem Correspondent.
The cabinet rejected left-wing ministers' calls for the introduction of
unemployment pay for tens of thousands of Palestinians who are being kept
away from their jobs in Israel since the closure began.
The growing hardship in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip is
attracting increasing international criticism. The US, which sees chances
for progress in the Middle East peace process ebbing away, called on Israel
over the weekend to ease conditions.
