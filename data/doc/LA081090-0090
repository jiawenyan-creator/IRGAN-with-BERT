ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; 
SURVEYS WILL ASK RESIDENTS' CONCERNS 
In an effort to shape the future of Buena Park, 30,000 surveys are being 
distributed this week asking residents what they think of the city. 
The questionnaires are part of Vision 2010, a citywide planning project 
recently approved by the City Council. 
"What we are trying to do is get a survey into the hands of every resident, one 
per household," said Andy Rich, chairman of the special task force overseeing 
the project. "We are looking for perceptions." 
As many as 10 resident committees may be formed to study issues found to be 
most critical, Rich said. 
The questionnaires kick off a yearlong campaign to get residents and business 
owners involved in the city's planning process. Since June, a committee of 10 
people selected by the council have worked to launch the project. The 
questionnaires are due by Aug. 24, but officials estimate that recommendations 
to the City Council won't be completed until next June. 
The survey, which is being distributed in two local newspapers, asks residents 
open-ended questions such as what is good about the city, what needs improving 
and what Buena Park should be like in 20 years. 
A questionnaire in Spanish will also be circulated, Rich added. 
Committee member Phil Walsh said 94 surveys have been returned so far and that 
the major concerns cited were traffic, gangs and graffiti. LYNDA NATALI
