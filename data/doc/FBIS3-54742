  [Text] The four terrorists arrested last Monday [27 
December] in the outskirts of Makhachkala, Dagestan, were 
brought on Wednesday night to Rostov-on-Don, where they 
kidnapped a group of school children last week. The Rostov 
Interior Department informed INTERFAX that the terrorists were 
being detained at a preliminary investigation prison in the 
city. The investigation is expected to continue in the new year. 
  According to INTERFAX reporters, on Thursday the local 
administration is planning a reception for the participants in 
the operation to release the hostages. 
  Meanwhile, the Chechen Interior Ministry has informed 
INTERFAX that not a single dollar banknote has been found on the 
territory of the Chechen republic: The terrorists claimed that 
they scattered banknotes flying over the republic. Earlier 
reports said several banknotes were found near Mineralnye Vody. 
It is believed that the terrorists scattered the banknotes when 
they flew on a helicopter from Mineralnye Vody to Makhachkala 
with the purpose of misleading law enforcement bodies.
