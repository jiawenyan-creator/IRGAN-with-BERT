FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Goodyear earnings at top end of
forecast
Third-quarter earnings at Goodyear, the US tyre maker, reached Dollars 1 a
share in spite of a fall in profit margins. The figure was at the top of the
earnings range forecast by the company a fortnight ago, writes Richard
Waters. Operating income in the tyre business fell Dollars 11m from a year
ago, to Dollars 250m, while sales grew from Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 2.7bn.
The company blamed the decline in margins on pressure to hold down prices,
higher rubber costs and the effects of Brazil's new economic adjustment
plan.
After the end of the quarter, Goodyear imposed price increases of between 3
per cent and 4.5 per cent.
Income in the general products segment fell Dollars 16m to Dollars 31.3m,
while oil transportation rebounded from a small loss to a Dollars 7.9m
profit.
However, due to a Dollars 32m fall in overhead and interest costs, overall
net income rose 11 per cent to Dollars 151.3m, on sales up 7 per cent.
