CAN OFFICIALS AND DEVELOPERS TALK? SURE, JUST DO IT IN PUBLIC 
I recently appeared before the Planning Commission on a controversial zoning 
matter. 
The issue was rather complicated with many subtleties so I sought Planning 
Commissioner Douglas Leavenworth's counsel prior to the public hearing. 
Even though the issue was very important to 65 homeowners, it wasn't a major 
item in the specific plan. 
Nevertheless, Mr. Leavenworth graciously extended to me a two-hour conference 
in order to review the many aspects of this issue. Later, the matter was 
satisfactorily settled before the Planning Commission. 
I am impressed with Commissioner Leavenworth's sincerity, integrity, and his 
willingness to take extra time to fully understand the many issues on which he 
must make decisions. Needless to say, I was disappointed and distressed to read 
your editorial (Aug. 17) claiming Commissioner Leavenworth has an "attitude 
problem." 
Are we talking about the same planning commissioner -- one who has an excellent 
reputation for serving Orange County diligently and honestly for many years? 
How could such a person be defiant or insensitive to the responsibilities and 
public trust of his position? 
I applaud The Times' efforts to uncover and clean up the self-serving and 
cheating politicians or bureaucrats. However, our system works because of the 
honesty and integrity of the majority of the people in our political and 
bureaucratic structure who day in and day out carry on the responsibilities of 
their positions for the good of our community. 
Commissioner Leavenworth is in the forefront of this group. We would indeed be 
the loser if he was replaced for a minor oversight which has now been 
corrected.
