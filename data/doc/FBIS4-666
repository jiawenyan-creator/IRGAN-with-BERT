  [Text] Colonel (Van de Weghe) of the Belgian Army says that 
the Rwandan Army leadership is prepared to enter into talks with 
the rebels about a truce. Even a joint government is not ruled 
out. Here is Colonel (Van de Weghe) being interviewed by Urbaan 
de Bekker: 
  [Begin recording] [Van de Weghe] Yes, indeed, there is a 
communique of a group of Rwandan higher officers, including the 
Rwandan Army chief. They state that they are prepared and that 
they wish to reach a cease-fire and even would want to form a 
provisional government together with Patriotic Front 
representatives. Until now this is of course a piece of paper, 
a statement. We must naturally hope that this will effectively 
turn into reality on the ground. 
  [De Bekker] It 's true that Colonel (Van de Weghe) is 
acquinted with some of the Rwandan officers but does not know, 
or does not yet know, to what extent the entire command and the 
entire Rwandan Army is bound by this communique. Nevertheless, 
it appears to be an important attempt to put an end to the 
atrocities and the violence in Rwanda. [end recording]
