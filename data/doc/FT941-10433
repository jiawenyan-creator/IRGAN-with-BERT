FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Molson links hardware side with
US warehouse
Molson, the diversified Canadian brewing group, has defused a potential
threat to its retail hardware business by forging a partnership with Home
Depot, the US retail warehouse operator.
Home Depot will pay CDollars 200m (USDollars 149.2m) for a 75 per cent stake
in the joint venture, to be known as The Home Depot Canada. Molson will hold
the remaining 25 per cent.
Home Depot Canada will take over and expand the Aikenhead's chain of
home-improvement warehouse stores currently wholly-owned by Molson.
Aikenhead's has seven outlets, each with about 125,000 sq ft of selling
space, and stocking some 35,000 items.
Aikenhead's has operated without serious competition, but faced a threat
from Home Depot, which had planned to set up its own operation in Canada.
Mr Bernie Marcus, Home Depot chairman, said the deal with Molson provided an
opportunity to penetrate the market 'more quickly and more profitably'.
The partnership aims to expand Aikenhead's to 50 outlets, including seven
new stores within the next 12 months.
Home Depot, with 269 stores in the US, is the latest of several US
warehouse-store operators to move into Canada. With huge volumes, direct
deals with manufacturers, and cheap premises on the outskirts of cities,
they are able to undercut traditional retailers.
