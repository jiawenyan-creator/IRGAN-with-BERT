FT  29 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Great Portland
Great Portland Estates is at pains to stress the generosity of Mr Richard
Peskin, its chairman, in giving up Basil &amp; Howard Samuel. Doubtless, there
is considerable sacrifice involved since Mr Peskin has long paid himself a
handsome salary from Samuel which has the exclusive contract to manage Great
Portland's rental properties. But the sacrifice is difficult to measure
since no one knew how much Mr Peskin was actually receiving. All that can be
said is that his remuneration under the new arrangements is so extravagant
that he must have been on to a very good thing indeed.
Not only is he to receive a Pounds 375,000 one-off payment. He also gets a
new managing director's salary of Pounds 325,000 fixed for two years without
any apparent connection to performance. On a three-year rolling contract, he
would cost Pounds 1m to sack. Institutions can claim some satisfaction that
the notice period is shorter than the five years prescribed before. But
there can be little happiness with a deal that so mocks the Cadbury spirit.
Great Portland will not separate the roles of chairman and chief executive
and lacks strong non-executive directors from outside the property scene. Mr
Peskin may feel he has made a great sacrifice. But the corporate governance
is not yet good, and he can still amply afford champagne at lunchtime.
