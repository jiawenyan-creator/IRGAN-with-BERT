SHORT TAKES; 
ACTOR BEGLEY BOOSTS RECYCLING 
Ed Begley Jr. says he has been into recycling since 1970 and recently refused a 
ride in an NBC limousine during a promotional tour for his new TV series, 
"Parenthood." 
Instead, Begley said in the November issue of Redbook, he rode his bike from 
his San Fernando Valley home to the Century City studio. 
"It's late. But it's not too late," said the former "St. Elsewhere" star, who 
is on the boards of seven environmental organizations and recycles everything 
from newspapers to metal products. 
"People have to realize that they can turn this around quicker than they think. 
How? By exercising their voting power and their purchasing power."
