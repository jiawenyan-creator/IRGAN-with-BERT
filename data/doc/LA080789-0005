RUNNING RED LIGHTS 
Within weeks of moving to Los Angeles I realized that there are only two rules 
that govern traffic flow on the streets here: 
1. Red lights and green lights are optional. 
2. Yellow means speed up. 
Anarchy reigns on the streets of Los Angeles and Frankel was absolutely right 
to question our ability to comply with the more invasive forms of regulations 
on the horizon. Traffic and police authorities should heed well his call for 
enforcement of existing laws. 
But as individual drivers we must also make a commitment to obey these laws, no 
matter how much it hurts our pride and our drive time.
