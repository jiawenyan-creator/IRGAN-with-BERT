<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Suspension and referendum order.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule suspends all the provisions applicable to pears and certain nomination provisions under Federal Marketing
Order (M.O.) No. 917. This rule also directs that a referendum be conducted among eligible pear producers in California
to determine whether they favor continuance of the pear provisions under M.O. 917. This suspension is being implemented
because the California Bartlett pear industry is now using a California State pear program, and is no longer using
the pear provisions under M.O. 917.

 
</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE:

 The suspension becomes effective April 4, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
This rule is issued under the provisions of section 8c(16)(A) of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937,
as amended (7 U.S.C. 601674), hereinafter referred to as the Act; and of 917.42 (b) of Marketing Order
No. 917 (7 CFR Part 917) regulating the handling of fresh pears and peaches grown in California, hereinafter referred
to as the order. 


The order authorizes minimum grade, maturity, quality, and size requirements; container size, pack, and marking
requirements; and reporting and special purpose shipment requirements. The order also provides for the establishment
of production and marketing research, market development, and paid advertising. 
The referendum will be conducted in accordance with the procedure for the conduct of referenda to determine whether
continuation of the order's pear provisions is favored by producers, who during the representative period were engaged,
in the State of California, in the production of pears covered by the order. The procedure applicable to the referenda
is the ``Procedure for the Conduct of Referenda in Connection with Marketing Orders for Fruits, Vegetables, and Nuts
Pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as Amended'' (7 CFR Part 900.400 

et seq.

). The representative production period for the conduct of such referendum is hereby determined to be June 1, 1994,
through November 30, 1994. The referendum will be conducted within the period beginning December 1, 1994, and ending

February 15, 1995. 
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.
