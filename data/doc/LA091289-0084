METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CLOUD-SEEDING PUT BACK ON AGENDA 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum plans to ask the Board of Supervisors today to 
consider reviving cloud-seeding in Los Angeles County, more than a decade since 
the rainmaking program was discontinued after complaints that it caused 
devastating mudslides in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. 
"I believe it is essential that every feasible measure to increase our precious 
water supplies must be thoroughly examined," Schabarum said. 
Water officials do not see an immediate danger of a water shortage. But Jay 
Malinowski, spokesman for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California, said: "If we have a dry winter, there could be serious problems 
next summer." 
Cloud-seeding was carried out over the San Gabriel Mountains throughout the 
1960s and most of the '70s, but the county halted the program in 1978 after 
numerous lawsuits were filed, claiming that the seeding intensified a major 
storm that killed 11 people and caused $43 million in property damage from 
mudslides. 
The county prevailed in each of the damage suits.
