FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Heineken shrugs off European
sales drop
Heineken, the Dutch brewer, shrugged off declining beer consumption in
Europe, its most important market, to post a 12 per cent increase in net
profit before extraordinary items in 1993.
Net profit rose to Fl 519m (Dollars 270m) before extraordinaries from Fl
463m in 1992, on turnover up 1.2 per cent at Fl 9.05bn.
If extraordinary items are included, total net profit fell because Heineken
booked a one-off extraordinary gain of Fl 101m on a Singapore land sale in
1992 but it showed no extraordinary gains in 1993.
Although the world beer market stagnated last year and Europe suffered a 5
per cent decline in consumption, the Dutch brewer managed to post higher
profits on normal business operations because of the relatively stronger
performance of its higher-margin premium beers and the effects of its
continuing cost-cutting measures.
Another factor in the rise was the drop in interest charges to Fl 2m from Fl
34m a year earlier, reflecting the company's high net cash flow.
In Europe, which accounts for about 75 per cent of Heineken's sales,
turnover fell by an unspecified amount but the rate of decline was below the
market's 5 per cent contraction, enabling the company to bolster its overall
market share. European beer consumption was hit by bad summer weather and by
the adverse economic climate.
The company, whose flagship Heineken brand is the best-selling imported beer
in the US, said exports to the US rose 'significantly' last year, as did
sales in China, Hong Kong and Vietnam.
Heineken, which is to pay an unchanged 1993 dividend of Fl 3.50, forecast a
further increase in net profit in 1994. It said it expected an extraordinary
net gain of Fl 58m this year on the sale of its 50 per cent stake in a
distilled spirits joint venture, Bols Benelux, to Bols Wessanen.
