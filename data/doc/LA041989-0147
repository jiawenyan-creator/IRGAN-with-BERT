BUSH PLANNING $10-BILLION CUT IN ARMS: CHENEY 
President Bush will announce a $10-billion cut in the U.S. military budget next 
week despite a promise to keep the Pentagon in step with inflation, Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney said today. 
Cheney, attending a NATO meeting in Brussels, said Bush had agreed with 
congressional leaders to chop $10 billion from the 1990 defense budget proposed 
by President Ronald Reagan before he left office in January. 
He told reporters that that would be a 0.9% real reduction from current levels. 
Bush earlier had planned to cut only $6.3 billion from the $315.2-billion 
Reagan proposal. 
The Pentagon "probably did better this year by the compromise up front" rather 
than getting into a long battle with Congress later in the year, Cheney said. 
Fifth in a Row 
While the cut would be the fifth real reduction in a row for U.S. military 
spending, Cheney said it is not as severe as earlier reductions. 
He refused to specify where cuts will be made, saying he expects Bush to make 
the announcement next Tuesday. 
But Defense Department officials have said that Cheney intends to cancel the 
Marine Corps' new V-22 tilt-rotor troop transport aircraft, delay the Army's 
LHX light helicopter program and transfer at least 24 Navy frigates to the 
reserve force. 
Cheney said Bush will also announce his spending proposal for the "Star Wars" 
anti-missile defense program and for mobilizing U.S. land-based strategic 
nuclear missiles. 
Cheney said he does not know whether Bush will opt for mounting 10-warhead MX 
missiles on rail cars or for development of a new Midgetman single-warhead 
missile -- or a mix of the two.
