FT  01 AUG 94 / Delors strong in French poll
Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing president of the European Commission and leading
Socialist contender in the French presidential race, could beat Mr Jacques
Chirac, the centre-right leader and mayor of Paris, in next year's
presidential elections, but would lose to Mr Edouard Balladur, prime
minister, according to the latest opinion poll.
The poll commissioned from the IFOP research consultancy for yesterday's
Journal du Dimanche newspaper, puts Mr Balladur in first place in the
presidential stakes, with the support of 17 per cent of the public, followed
by Mr Delors with 14 per cent and Mr Chirac with 11 per cent. Mr Bernard
Tapie, the beleaguered left-winger whose furniture last week was confiscated
by his bank, has held on to fourth place although the flood of publicity
over his financial problems now seems to be affecting his popularity.
Support for Mr Tapie has fallen to 7 per cent from 10 per cent over the past
month, according to the poll.
