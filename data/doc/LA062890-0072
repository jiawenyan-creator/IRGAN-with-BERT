WESTSIDE DIGEST: MARINA DEL REY; 
NEW BOAT SLIPS CONSIDERED 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will study the feasibility of building dozens 
of new boat slips along the main channel in Marina del Rey. 
The county Board of Supervisors this week approved the $100,000 study to 
determine whether 20 acres of new slips can be built in the small-craft harbor 
without inhibiting boat traffic. 
County administrators said that under the proposal, up to 100 new slips would 
be built, but the precise number has not been determined. 
The county will also consider combining smaller boat slips in existing 
anchorages to create berths for larger vessels. Ted Reed, director of the 
Department of Beaches and Harbors, said most vacant slips in the harbor now are 
for boats of less than 30 feet, while demand for larger slips is increasing. 
The marina's 6,200 boat slips are operated by private anchorages, which pay 25% 
of their gross income to the county as rent for the publicly owned property.
