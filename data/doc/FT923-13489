FT  13 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Pioneering social audit from Traidcraft
TRAIDCRAFT, the Gates-head-based distributor of third world goods, has
published a pioneering social audit of the company to accompany its accounts
for the 1991-92 year.
Including redundancy costs of Pounds 45,000, the pre-tax loss for the 12
months to end-March was reduced from Pounds 118,000 to Pounds 23,000.
The social audit was a preliminary document attempting to assess the wider,
non-financial impacts of the company on its customers and employees which
should be ready by the time of the next annual report, according to Mr
Richard Evans, external affairs director.
While a growing number of companies are producing statements on
environmental policies and impacts, the Traidcraft report attempts to go
much further in analysing the company's impact.
The audit - which was prepared by the directors - shows that 68 per cent of
total sales of Pounds 5.39m were of goods from the third world last year,
compared with 98 per cent of total sales of Pounds 830,000 in 1982.
It reports a planned 10 per cent reduction in gas consumption during the
current year and discusses its use of recycled materials.
The audit also shows a staff turnover of 4 per cent, excluding 16 of the
redundancies from the workforce of 134 at the beginning of the last
financial year. It says there are no employees from ethnic minorities, but
two registered disabled staff.
It also lists 65 working days for executives and managers taken up with
training.
There are about 3,750 non-voting current shareholders.
