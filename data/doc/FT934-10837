FT  03 NOV 93 / Recruitment: How living costs vary worldwide - Survey shows
that at least 40 other cities rank ahead of London in expensiveness league
AT LAST the multitudinous globetrotters among the FT's readership can cease
tapping their hooves impatiently, not to mention telephoning to demand
'where is it?' What they've been waiting for is in the table down to the
right: the latest indicators of international living costs as calculated by
the P-E International consultancy.
The reason why they are appearing two months later than usual is that the
consultancy has expanded its regular survey to include far more than basic
cost data. To compensate for the delay, however, it is allowing the Jobs
column not only to print extracts from the study several days ahead of
official publication, but to give figures for 75 different places around the
world instead of 60 as before.
That is still barely more than half the number, 143 cities in 118 countries,
covered by the study. Anyone wanting information on other places should
contact Joanna Pawulska-Saunders of P-E's centre for management research at
Park House, Wick Rd, Egham, Surrey TW20 0HW; tel (0)784 43441, fax (0)784
437828. The price of the report is Pounds 500.
My table gives three figures for each of the cities included. The first is
an indication of the local cost of a 'basket' of goods and services
typically bought by executives, and represented by an index based on London
prices at 100. Next comes the most recent official rate of inflation to hand
when the data were compiled. The third - the exchange rate at which the
other currencies have been converted to sterling - will strike most readers
as having an antique and in some cases nostalgic look. After all, 172.75 yen
and even 1.52 US dollars are appreciably more than Pounds 1 will buy now.
The explanation is that the rates of exchange given in the table are those
which prevailed on the date when the original information on price levels
was collated: to wit, April 5. And my excuse for refraining from adjusting
them is not just pressure of work, but also a foreboding based on past
experience that, had I done so, something would have happened to change them
all again in hours. For instance, the appearance of the indicators three
years ago co-incided with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and my update of them
the following January with the onset of the Gulf war.
Besides, although the cost-index figures in the table reflect the April
exchange rates, there is a simple way of adjusting the indices in line with
changes in currency values. Except in countries with soaring inflation, of
course, the prices of the sorts of goods and services covered by the survey
change only slowly. So the basic cost data collected last spring should in
most cases remain a tolerable guide to reality until at least the end of the
year.
To compensate for currency-market movements in the meantime, all that is
needed is a two-step calculation. First take the exchange rate given in the
table, and divide it by the rate currently in force. Then multiply the
result by the table's index figure and, hey presto, you are up to date.
As an example, since the yen rate was down from 172.75 to 160.25 last Monday
night, Tokyo's index was up from 179.8 to 193.8, and Osaka's from 172.1 to
185.5. So whereas the difference between them from the Brits' angle was
previously 7.7 points, it is now 8.3 - the same as the gap between London's
100 and the 91.7 of Birmingham, which is included in the study for the first
time.
Another innovation is that the latest report provides some compensation for
a weakness affecting all surveys of world living expenses that I have come
across to date. It is that, because of the difficulty in devising an
internationally consistent yardstick of housing costs, the surveys take no
account of that important outlay at all.
While the same remains true of the indices I've printed, P-E has joined with
the Hamptons Relocation consultancy - which operates world-wide from its
base in Swindon - to give information on accommodation costs in 46 cities.
Here is a sample, showing the typical range of monthly rents apparently
charged for an unfurnished three-bedroom apartment (prices in sterling at
the exchange rates of April 5):
