SPIES AND NATIONAL SECURITY 
Espionage has become big business. In his article, Christopher says, " . . . 
Spying has endangered our national security to such a breathtaking extent that 
we can all be thankful that war did not break out while some of our most 
sensitive secrets were compromised." 
Perhaps. But maybe the truth is just the opposite. 
Perhaps the reason that the Cold War never turned hot was because our secrets, 
as well as the Soviets' were compromised. (We have our spies, too.) It's not 
impossible that the acts of those agents provided each of us with enough "hard" 
information about the other's abilities to prevent a suicidal act.
