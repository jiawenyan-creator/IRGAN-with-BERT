  [Text] Belgrade, April 12 (TANJUG) -- One of the two U.S. 
F-18s which attacked Serb positions near Gorazde on Monday 
bombed the centre of the city by mistake killing a large number 
of civilians, says SRNA, the news agency of the Bosnian Serb 
Republic. 
  SRNA cites a radio message sent by a U.N. observer in 
Gorazde 
to the pilot of the aircraft and adds that this was also 
confirmed by several citizens of Gorazde who managed to reach 
the Serb positions. 
  According to SRNA, the blast killed many civilians and 
caused 
considerable material damage. 
  Moslem Sarajevo Radio on Monday evening said that the Serb 
shelling left 160 people wounded and 62 dead. 
  U.S. NATO-assigned warplanes on Sunday and Monday launched 
air strikes on Serb positions close to Gorazde, Moslem enclave 
in southeast Bosnia-Herzegovina. The number of victims is as 
yet unknown. 
  Bosnian Serb Republic Vice-President Biljana Plavsic said on 
Monday that the victims were Serb civilians and that Serb 
children had been bombed by sophisticated laser technology. 
  The United Nations months ago ruled Gorazde a safe area, 
together with five other zones in Bosnia. Although it was set 
to be demilitarized, this city served as a starting point of a 
major 10,000-strong Moslem offensive against the Serbs. 
  According to U.N. reports, the Gorazde battles were provoked 
by the Moslems.
