  [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- Russian nationalist leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy expressed today his solidarity with 
Valentin Varennikov, a leader of the 1991 abortive Soviet coup, 
who is now at trial by the military panel of the Supreme Court. 
  Varennikov was the only ringleader of the attempted coup who 
refused to accept parliament's amnesty in February and insisted 
that a court investigation of his case goes on. 
  Zhirinovskiy appeared in the court-room on Tuesday to make a 
joint statement with Varennikov saying that a special 
perliamentary commission should control the general prosecutor's 
office investigating the case.
