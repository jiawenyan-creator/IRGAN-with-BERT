FT  30 SEP 93 / Sharif associate killed in Punjab
MR Ghulam Hyder Wyne, a former chief minister of Punjab province and a close
associate of Mr Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister, was assassinated
yesterday by gunmen near the city of Mian Chunun in central Punjab, writes
Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad.
The killing raised concern over security in the run-up to elections next
Wednesday.
Ms Benazir Bhutto and Mr Sharif are both campaigning to make a political
comeback.
Mr Wyne was dragged from his car and shot after the vehicle was fired on and
stopped. His driver and two other passengers sustained serious injuries,
police said last night. The killing was condemned by politicians loyal to
both Mr Sharif and Ms Bhutto.
Investigators indicated the killing might have been a personal attack. An
injured passenger has apparently identified a gunman, which led the police
to discount political motives.
