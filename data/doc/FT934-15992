FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Shares in Campari fall on Pounds 3.1m loss
Reflecting the impact of recession, devaluation of sterling and delivery
problems with suppliers, Campari International, the designer and marketer of
leisure wear, incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.1m for the first half of
1993, against profits of Pounds 1.03m.
Mr Christopher Cheng, chairman, said that against the background of a
hostile trading climate in the majority of the group's markets 'we do not
anticipate a return to profitability until the second half of 1994 at the
earliest'.
The shares reacted strongly and closed 49p down at 93p.
There is no interim dividend - last year's was 3.25p - and directors are to
delay a decision on any payment until preliminary results next March.
Turnover was Pounds 20m (Pounds 18.73) but Mr Cheng explained that after
eliminating currency translation effects and the impact of sales by new
operations in France and Italy on a like-for-like basis it was 6 per cent
lower.
Losses per share amounted to 29.01p (7.27p earnings).
Mr Cheng stated that profit margins were squeezed by the continuing impact
of recession, particularly in the UK where the group was unable to pass on
cost increases arising from the weakness of sterling.
