  [Text] Blagoveshchensk, 15 Jun -- At a meeting with Amur 
Oblast officials today, Russian President Boris Yeltsin spoke 
about the strategic purpose of reducing the strength of the 
Russian Army from three million servicemen to one and a half 
million. 
  Speaking about the provision of the Russian Army with 
technical equipment, the president said it did not need much 
equipment, but it needed mobile weapons which could compete on 
international market. 
  Boris Yeltsin spoke about an intention to share the arms 
markets for selling Russian military equipment and said that 
following the Malaysian example, Thailand and Australia would 
also be buying Russian weapons. "There are no ideological 
obstacles to this," Boris Yeltsin stressed.
