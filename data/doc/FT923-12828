FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: Fininvest profit hit by
Mondadori purchase
FININVEST, the media, retailing and investment group controlled by Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the Italian magnate, saw 1991 net profits fall 68 per cent to
L61.3bn (Dollars 54m).
The sharp reduction reflected the effects of absorbing Mondadori, the
publishing group purchased last year. As a result, the group's net debt rose
21 per cent last year to L2,938bn, higher than forecast by analysts, and
compares with net assets of L1,178bn.
The Mondadori purchase also underlined that last year's growth in sales was
generated by acquisitions. The group's consolidated turnover rose 33 per
cent from L7,561bn to L10,096bn. With Mondadori stripped out sales growth
was down to 14 per cent.
Fininvest, which is Italy's third-largest private group after Fiat and
Ferruzzi-Montedison, invested heavily, with L1,158bn spent on cinema and
television rights to support its core media business. The group said 1992
consolidated turnover could be L12,300bn.
Despite the stagnant state of the Italian economy, the group said increased
efficiency led to a 10 per cent rise in operating profits to L544bn.
However, this was not reflected in after-tax profits because of growing
financial costs.
The Berlusconi family controls all but 10 per cent of minority stakes in the
group's two publicly-quoted companies, Mondadori and Standa, the store
chain. The group, Europe's largest media empire after Germany's Bertelsmann,
gave no hint of any flotations.
The group's media activities have come under the scrutiny of the media
ombudsman in Italy after newspaper editors and other television competitors
claimed Mr Berlusconi was stifling competition and manipulating the
advertising market. Mr Berlusconi is currently contesting a ruling that
would cap television advertising receipts which could entail a potential
loss of L300bn in advertising receipts.
