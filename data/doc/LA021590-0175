ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
WAVE-A-THON WILL BENEFIT MUSEUM 
A fund-raising effort for the new Huntington Beach International Surfing Museum 
is under way, involving surfers and the numbers of waves they can ride in two 
hours. 
The first Wave-A-Thon solicits pledges for a donation for each wave a surfer 
can ride within that time. 
Surfers are allowed to pick any date or time of day between now and Feb. 26, 
the cutoff date for the event. The sponsor, Bleu Ice Sportswear, is donating 
prizes to the top fund-raisers. 
Money generated from the Wave-A-Thon will be used for lighting, carpets and 
exhibits in the surfing museum, which is scheduled to open June 16 at 411 Olive 
Ave. in downtown Huntington Beach. 
Anyone wanting to take part in the Wave-A-Thon may call (714) 960-3483 for 
information and pledge forms.
