MORNING REPORT: MUSIC 
Opera in the Amazon: Opera will be performed in the heart of the Amazon rain 
forest for the first time in more than 80 years when the legendary Teatro 
Amazonas reopens Saturday after a three-year, $8-million restoration. 
The theater was built in the city of Manaus in 1896 at the height of Brazil's 
rubber boom. But the theater staged its last opera in 1907, when Brazilian 
rubber began losing its markets to Southeast Asian exporters. Opening night of 
Opera Brasil will feature excerpts of "Guarany," an opera by Carlos Gomes. 
Placido Domingo will appear in "Carmen" on March 29. BETH KLEID
