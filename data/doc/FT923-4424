FT  07 SEP 92 / Observer: Weekend in Bath
It is six years since Britain last held the EC presidency. But judged by the
weekend's meeting of finance ministers in Bath, those charged with running
the show have not forgotten how to entertain.
Take for instance the official outing for participants' spouses to Wells
Cathedral. No problem there, you would think, except that - as the local
paper gleefully pointed out - Norman Lamont is buried there. This was not a
bad joke at the expense of the British chancellor's funereal briefing style,
but the final resting place of Sir Norman Lamont, a local MP from an
earlier, more civilised era.
The present Norman Lamont, by contrast, got a much rougher ride. Whenever
the Chancellor stepped out of the peace and quiet of the finance ministers'
meeting, he was barracked by protesters ranging from the right-wing Freedom
Association to the Revolutionary Communists.
The meeting closed in the shadow of balloons launched from near the city
centre. As observers were quick to point out, they sent a mixed signal to
the earth-bound ministers and the EC economy: buoyant, drifting, or - given
that the meeting overran by more than an hour - just full of hot air?
