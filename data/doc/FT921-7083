FT  25 FEB 92 / Letter: Finance - the common ground between management
disciplines
Sir, There is some truth in Mr Willis' reply (Letters, February 20) to the
suggestion by Mr Akio Morita, chairman of Sony, that accountants should not
lead industry.
As with all generalisations, examples can be found to prove the point, but
neither Mr Willis nor Mr Morita can deny that the only real common ground
between disciplines in any business, whether in engineering or not, is
finance.
Relations with the workforce are not entirely influenced by money but the
level of the pay packet will always be an inescapable factor. How is a
company to afford competitive pay if it ignores the economics of its
products and markets?
A similar question arises over investment in the development of new
products. It is not enough to let ideas from the grass roots be turned into
products without considering the common ground of money where today's
investment is tomorrow's profit. Not many businesses will prosper without
these and other financial disciplines.
Certainly, vision and leadership in business is an essential ingredient for
success in the UK as well as in Japan and some accountants at the helm of
British industry lack such skills and could be criticised for detachment and
'short termism'.
However, the FT's report (February 20) of losses at Sony suggests the
emphasis on technology in management may not offer a foolproof solution
either.
Perhaps Mr Morita is wishing now he had a better balance between finance and
other skills in his boardroom.
