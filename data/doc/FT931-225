FT  31 MAR 93 / Trade unions see membership fall
MEMBERSHIP of all independent trade unions fell by more than 320,000 in 1991
to just under 9.5m, while union assets increased by Pounds 26m to Pounds
661m in the same period, the Certification Office, which regulates the
activities of unions and employers' organisations, says.
In its annual report the office says gross income for unions increased 10.3
per cent to Pounds 619.6m in 1991 while gross expenditure rose to Pounds
597.9m. The average annual contribution per union member was Pounds 53.22p.
The gross income of employers' associations rose 9.5 per cent to Pounds 165m
with expenditure increasing by about the same amount to Pounds 157m.
The number of members of TUC-affiliated unions is about 7.7m, so nearly 2m
union members are in non-TUC unions. The only two unions to grow in 1991
were Nalgo, the local government union, which grew 16,000 to 760,000, and
the teachers' union NASUWT which grew 11,000 to 180,000.
More than Pounds 4m was paid to unions last year by the office under the
statutory ballot refund scheme, which covers most of the cost of ballots and
which is being phased out over the next three years.
The office refused a certificate of independence to the staff association
formed at the GCHQ government communications centre after the banning of
TUC-affiliated Civil Service unions at the centre. The Employment Appeal
Tribunal upheld the office's decision.
