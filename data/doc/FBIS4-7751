  [Text] Bucharest, April 5 (AFP) -- Romanian Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu said Tuesday it was unacceptable that 
Russia should billet peacekeeping troops in former Soviet 
republics that are now independent states. 
  In an interview with AFP, Melescanu said Russian 
peacekeeping 
operations should be carried out only in accordance with the 
United Nations and the countries involved. "The presence of 
Russian military forces in countries that have declared their 
independence is a principle that we cannot accept," he said. 
  Russian troops are stationed in neighboring Moldova where 
separatists of Russian origin have declared a republic. Romania 
has historic and cultural ties with Moldova. Most of Moldova 
belonged to Romania until the area was annexed by the former 
Soviet Union in the 1939 peace pact between Stalin and Hitler. 
  "We understand Russia's worry about the Russian minorities 
that live in former Soviet republics. But for their protection, 
European diplomatic mechanisms must be emphasized instead of 
military means," Melescanu said. 
  There is to be a summit meeting between Russian and Romania 
later this year.
