FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major's rating continues to slip
MR JOHN MAJOR'S standing as prime minister continues to slump, according to
a Gallup poll published today in the Daily Telegraph.
Only 27.9 per cent are satisfied with his performance - a fall of nearly
half since the general election 11 months ago. Nearly a third of voters,
31.6 per cent, now think Labour leader Mr John Smith would make the best
prime minister.
