  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has 
again urged Turkey to use weapons supplied through German 
military aid exclusively within the scope of the NATO mandate of 
the Turkish armed forces. In a letter to his Turkish 
counterpart, Hikmet Cetin, published in Bonn today, Kinkel wrote 
that Cetin should see to it that the relevant agreement of June 
1992 was complied with. 
  The German foreign minister referred to the fact that 
politicians and the media kept claiming that weapons supplied by 
Germany were being used inside Turkey in the fight against the 
banned Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) contrary to the terms of 
the agreement. The Turkish Government knew "that this problem 
has considerable influence on the shaping of bilateral 
relations," Kinkel said.
