FT  14 MAY 94 / 450 jobs to be cut at GEC Alsthom
GEC Alsthom, the Franco-British power and transportation equipment group, is
cutting 450 UK jobs, Andrew Baxter writes. It says the restructuring is
designed to 'meet changing market conditions and combat strong international
competition'.
The cuts, in the company's power plants and traction businesses, are its
biggest since 1991 when it shed 900 jobs and closed its power equipment
plant at Larne, Northern Ireland.
The latest retrenchment, along with redeployment, will halve the company's
workforce at Trafford Park, Manchester, to 750. But there will be a net gain
of 130 jobs at Preston and 180 at Rugby.
GEC Alsthom Traction, which makes propulsion and power-supply systems for
railway rolling stock, is cutting 220 jobs at Manchester and 130 at Preston,
and moving 260 commercial, engineering and administrative workers from
Trafford Park to Preston.
Mr Douglas Gadd, chairman of GEC Alsthom in the UK, said rationalisation of
propulsion unit production around one plant had been under discussion for
some time. The move partly reflected the imminent British Rail privatisation
and the resulting 'absolute shortage of orders'.
