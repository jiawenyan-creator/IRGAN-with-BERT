  [Text] Tehran, April 20, IRNA -- Majlis Vice-Speaker, 
Hojjat ol-Eslam Hasan Rowhani and Bosnian Ambassador to Tehran, 
Omar Bahman here Wednesday [20 April] called on Islamic states 
to escalate their efforts to end the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Speaking at the meeting, Rowhani held the United Nations and 
the superpowers responsible for the tragic events in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "It was beyond one's imagination that an organization which 
should safeguard the rights and security of nations would act in 
such a way that encourages the aggressor." 
  The United Nations generously handed over to others a large 
part of a country which it has already recognized while the real 
owners of the country have a small portion which is under siege 
of Serbs, he said. 
  Referring to the intolerable situation in Bosnia, Rowhani 
said this is while big powers have all necessary means to stop 
such brutal bloodletting. 
  Rowhani, who chairs Majlis foreign policy committee, also 
referred to Washington's empty warnings of air strikes against 
Serbian forces and armaments. 
  "But," he said, "we saw American officials raise the threat 
of air strike tens of times but after that they spoke in such a 
tone to make Serbs realize that they were not practically 
serious about those threats." 
  Rowhani voiced Iran's readiness to help the defenceless 
people of Bosnia and called on Bosnian ambassador to convey the 
condolence of the Iranian Government and people to the Bosnian 
nation and government for the tragic developments in that 
country. 
  Bahman said in response that what was happening in Bosnia 
and 
Gorazde was an orchestrated conspiracy aimed at wiping out the 
Muslim nation, Islamic culture and history.
