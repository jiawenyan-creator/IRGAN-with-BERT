Applicant's Representations


1. Invesco, a registered open-end investment company, filed a declaration pursuant to rule 24f2 under the
Act to register an indefinite amount of shares under the Securities Act of 1933.


2. An investment company that has filed a declaration under rule 24f2 must file annual notices with the SEC and
pay share registration fees for shares sold in the previous fiscal year. If the rule 24f2 notice is filed within
two months after the close of the investment company's fiscal year, the amount of the registration fee is based on net
sales (new sales minus redemptions) in the year in question. If the rule 24f2 notice is not filed within two months,
the registration fee is based on gross sales (with no credit for redemptions). At the latest, the rule 24f2 notice
along with the appropriate registration fee must be filed within six months after the end of an investment company's
fiscal year.
