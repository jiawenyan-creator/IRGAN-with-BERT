TENNIS ROUNDUP; 
NAVRATILOVA, CAPRIATI WIN IN 2ND ROUND 
Martina Navratilova, hobbled by a hamstring injury, and Jennifer Capriati each 
fought off challenges from unseeded opponents Wednesday to advance to the third 
round of the Italian Open in Rome. 
Navratilova defeated Australia's Rachel McQuillan, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2, and 
14-year-old Capriati outlasted Susan Sloane, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5). 
The top-seeded Navratilova, wearing a bandage around her left thigh, showed 
little movement over the red clay of the Foro Italico. 
"I'm playing it day by day," she said. "I can't go 100%. I'm playing at about 
three-quarter speed." 
Capriati, who turned pro in March and is seeded 12th, had beaten Sloane, 6-4, 
6-1, at Hilton Head, S.C., last month in her third pro tournament. In another 
match, third-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain Kristin Godridge of 
Australia, 6-1, 6-1. 
Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union faces a fine after failing to show for his 
match at the $1-million German Open at Hamburg, West Germany. 
Chesnokov, seeded eighth, was scheduled to face West German Udo Riglewski in a 
second-round match, and officials replaced him with Lars Jonsson of Sweden. 
Unseeded Jimmy Arias of the United States beat Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland, 
6-4, 2-6, 6-2, and Henri Leconte of France downed Jordi Arrese of Spain, 6-4, 
1-6, 6-2. 
Third-seeded David Wheaton avoided becoming the fifth seeded player to lose in 
the U.S. Clay Court championships at Kiawah Island, S.C., rallying to beat 
qualifier Craig Campbell, 1-6, 6-3, 7-5.
