  [Text] Moscow November 29 TASS -- "Russia might initiate 
the use of nuclear weapons under certain conditions. This is 
envisaged in its military doctrine which has proclaimed the 
nuclear deterrence to be the backbone of its military policy and 
the means of deterring not only nuclear but conventional wars as 
well. At the same time Russia pledges not to use nuclear 
weapons first," said Professor Sergey Rogov, deputy director of 
the Institute for the U.S. and Canada Studies and president of 
the Centre of National Security and International Relations at a 
news conference held in the Russo- American information centre 
on Monday. 
  Rogov said that the document reflects a more open approach 
to 
problems of national security than the one earlier practiced by 
the soviet political and military leadership. Rogov described 
such an approach as "a tangible step in declarative nuclear 
strategy."
