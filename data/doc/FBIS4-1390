  [Text] [Announcer Patricia Glyn] Our reporter has arrived 
at Jan Smuts Airport. Hendrick Martin is on the line to us from 
there now to give us an update on the bomb which occurred there 
earlier this morning. Hendrick, hello. How close are you to 
where the bomb actually exploded? 
  [Martin] Well, I'm on the spot where the bomb exploded, on 
the inside of the airport building. It's actually just outside 
the windows on the second floor, a sort of parking area, it's 
just opposite the international departures hall. A lot of 
damage has been done. The windows are smashed. The ceiling has 
fallen in in several places. Even from the ground floor 
outside, some of the windows were shattered, and you can also 
parts of the ceiling hanging down. 
  [Glyn] Hendrick, our news bulletin at nine implied that 18 
people had been injured. Do you have an update on that number 
for us, and have they been taken to hospital? 
  [Martin] There seems to be conflicting reports on this. One 
of the fireman said 18 people had been injured, but according to 
the managing director of the airport, Mr. (Braam Loots), only 
nine people were injured and only one of them seriously injured. 
And the police say there were no fatalities. Now at this stage 
everybody who has been injured has been removed. The airport 
has actually been opened, and most of emergency vehicles have 
departed already. 
  [Glyn] Hendrick, the injured, were they were passengers or 
people merely seeing others off in the international arrivals 
hall? 
  [Martin] I can't give you specifics on that. What I can say 
is that one of the witnesses, one of the people who was actually 
injured, very slightly, but he was injured in the blast, and he 
saw what was happening. He and a number of people with him, all 
of them employees of the airport, and they seem to have been 
injured, he mentioned a figure of four or five people. I think, 
if I look at the damage, I think some people who may have been 
passengers could have been injured as well because of the damage 
on the inside of the building. This is were passengers collect 
for their departures. 
  [Glyn] So Hendrick let me get this straight, the bomb was 
planted in a car outside the international arrivals hall, but 
the distance between where the car was parked and the hall was 
merely a matter of meters, was it? 
  [Martin] That's how it looks. According to this witness, he 
told me his whole story. He saw a white Peugeot vehicle and he 
saw smoke coming from the boot of this car. He had two traffic 
officials with him, they also saw it, and they tried via radio 
to contact, to get help, to get someone to come and look at 
this, and he said the next moment there was a tremendous blast, 
and it is literally just on the other side of the window. 
  [Glyn] Now did this person also see the man that the police 
are looking for, some chap with red hair who was taken away, or 
drove away in a Toyota Corolla? 
  [Martin] No, he didn't see anybody, at least he didn't 
mention seeing anybody, but another witness apparently did see 
someone running away from the area, and apparently the police 
are in the process of compiling an identikit based on the 
description of the person. 
  [Glyn] Hendrick, thank you very much.
