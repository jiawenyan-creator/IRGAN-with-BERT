FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Toyota to create US parts
facility
TOYOTA, the leading Japanese carmaker, is to invest more than Dollars 75m in
the US to create a new North American parts operation with the aim of
increasing the use of replacement parts purchased in the US to more than 50
per cent by 1995.
Of this sum,Dollars 67m will be invested in a new parts warehouse in
Ontario, California, which is planned to begin operations by early 1996. The
remainder will be invested in new parts ordering and distribution systems.
The facility, which will be one of the largest Toyota parts centres in the
world, will have a stock of around 200,000 different components.
Toyota said that the new organisation would cut the lead-time for supplying
parts to its North American distributors from 40 to seven days by moving
replacement parts inventories from Japan to the US. Distributors' parts
inventory would also be cut by Dollars 100m.
Toyota's domestic production of cars and commercial vehicles in Japan fell
by 3.8 per cent last year to 3,931,341, the company reported in Tokyo.
Domestic car output declined by only 0.3 per cent to 3,171,311, while truck
and bus production dropped steeply by 16 per cent to 760,030.
Overseas vehicle output rose sharply, however, with a 14.1 per cent increase
to 764,292 helped largely by the expansion of production in North America.
In Europe, Toyota opened its first car assembly plant in December with the
start-up of its Pounds 700m plant located in the UK.
Toyota's total vehicle exports from Japan declined marginally by 0.3 per
cent to 1,698,236, but of this total car exports rose by 3.6 per cent to
