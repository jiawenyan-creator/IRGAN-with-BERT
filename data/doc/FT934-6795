FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: 'Investor fatigue' affects latest Lloyd's
trust offers
Just one third of the shares allocated to private investors in the
Angerstein Underwriting Trust, the Lloyd's investment trust, were taken up.
Separately, only 62 per cent of the shares on offer to intermediaries were
taken up in Abtrust Lloyd's Insurance Trust.
The figures highlight the difficulties in attracting investor interest in
such high numbers to take advantage of the introduction of corporate capital
to Lloyd's, the insurance market.
NatWest Markets, which sponsored the Angerstein trust, said that 67.5m of
the 75m shares on offer had been placed with institutional and other
investors. Of the 22.5m shares available to the public, 7.7m were taken up.
The offer was not underwritten, but 67.5m of the shares were placed with
institutions, with a 'clawback' for those which investors took up.
Mr Chris Huggins, a director, said: 'It's always disappointing when you
don't get all the money you wanted. Investors are showing general tiredness
with the new issues market. Relative to other Lloyd's trusts, we think this
is pretty good.'
Abtrust received applications for 4.6m of the 7.5m shares offered to
intermediaries. The full 30m share subscription was placed, with clawback
for that available to intermediaries. It will raise Pounds 28.35m net.
Mr Christopher Holdsworth Hunt, a director of Peel Hunt, the sponsors, said:
'We suffered a bit of investor fatigue. The orange has been squeezed dry.
But in the circumstances we are happy.'
