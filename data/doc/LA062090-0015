MORNING REPORT: OPERA 
Dame Sutherland Rings Down the Curtain: Dame Joan Sutherland says she wants to 
be remembered for her voice in its prime, so she has withdrawn from her 
December appearances in Covent Garden, which were to have been the last of her 
career. The 63-year-old diva had been cast in the role of Rosalinde in "Die 
Fledermaus." Instead, her final opera appearance will be in Sydney on Oct. 2 in 
"Les Huguenots," Royal Opera House officials said. GREG BRAXTON
