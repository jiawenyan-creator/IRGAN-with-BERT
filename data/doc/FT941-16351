FT  11 JAN 94 / Vocational body hits back at jibe
The quango responsible for developing the new system of vocational
qualifications in England and Wales yesterday hit back at a senior academic
who described the system as a 'disaster of epic proportions'.
The National Council for Vocational Qualifications said in a 36-point
statement that a report from a team headed by Professor Alan Smithers of the
Centre for Education and Employment Research at Manchester University, was
'inaccurate and misleading'.
The council and Prof Smithers disagree over the work-based national
vocational qualifications (NVQs) and the general national vocational
qualifications (GNVQs) which are intended to be 'vocational A-levels'. Prof
Smithers claimed yesterday that he had received several hundred letters and
telephone calls, and that most has said: 'Thank goodness somebody has spoken
out.'
Prof Smithers claims that the new qualifications are based on what a student
can do, with little formal regard for knowledge or theory acquired about the
subject. Written examinations are, for example, not compulsory for NVQs.
The council said it had received support from many organisations. It said
that, if candidates were unable to present evidence of competence through
performance alone, it might be necessary to collect evidence of their
possession of 'the essential underpinning of knowledge and understanding'.
