  [Excerpts] Regional cooperation between states, as well as 
our demonstrated unwillingness to join this cooperation with 
regard to security issues, was another much debated topic during 
the trip by Madelaine Albright and John Shalikashvili in the 
four states of Central and East Europe. Jiri Payne, chairman of 
the foreign committee of the Chamber of Deputies, told our 
correspondent Miroslav Repka the following: 
  [Begin recording] In your opinion, should the Czech Republic 
take an independent course of action in joining the Partnership 
for Peace project or should it be done jointly, within the 
Visegrad Group? 
  [Payne] The initiative itself is formulated in such a way 
that every state is to take an independent course of action. 
Every state has to decide for itself on the speed with which it 
wants to progress in the cooperation. [passage omitted] [end

  [Announcer] Jiri Dienstbier, former foreign minister and 
present chairman of the Free Democrats, voiced a somewhat 
different opinion on the participation of individual states of 
the Visegrad Group in the Partnership for Peace. 
  [begin Dienstbier recording] Of course, I believe that each 
of these Central European countries has to create its own 
internal conditions for joining the structures of the developed 
world, including NATO. However, I also strongly believe that, if 
these four countries take a joint course of action, they will, 
either jointly or individually, achieve this much sooner. If the 
four countries keep quarreling and outdoing each other while 
trying to prove who is better and who is worse, there is no 
guarantee of a desired achievement. [end recording]
