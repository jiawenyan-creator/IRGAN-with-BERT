  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has received Mate 
Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign minister, who 
is on an official visit in Ankara, at the Cankaya Mansion. 
  According to a statement issued by the Press Center of the 
President's Office, Granic thanked Turkey for its support and 
constructive stand in solving the problems associated with the 
dissolution of Yugoslavia. Granic stated that despite the swift 
implementation of the Croatian-Bosnian agreement signed in 
Washington, the Bosnians and the Croats are forced to flee their 
homes because of continuing Serbian attacks. Granic invited 
Demirel to Zagreb and Sarajevo. 
  Demirel, in turn, stated that establishing peace in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina will prevent the clashes from spreading to Kosovo, 
Sandzak, Vojvodina, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM], and the rest of the Balkans. 
  Demirel stated that he will be very happy to visit Zagreb 
and 
Sarajevo at a [word indistinct] time when he can contribute to 
the peace process.
