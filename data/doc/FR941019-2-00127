 



Situation: 

The United States has many military bases and other facilities located in other countries. These facilities procure
substantial goods and services from suppliers in the host country. In country X, it comes to the attention of the local
U.S. military base commander that bids to supply certain construction services have been rigged.


Discussion: 

Sales made by a foreign party to the U.S. Government, including to a U.S. facility located in a foreign country, are
within U.S. antitrust jurisdiction when they fall within the rule of Section 3.13 above. Bid-rigging of sales to the
U.S. Government represents the kind of conduct that can lead to an antitrust action. Indeed, in the United States this
type of behavior is normally prosecuted by the Department as a criminal offense. In practice, the Department has whenever
possible worked closely with the host country antitrust authorities to explore remedies under local law. This has
been successful in a number of instances.

If, however, local law does not provide adequate remedies, or the local authorities are not prepared to take action,
the Department will weigh the comity factors, discussed in Section 3.2 

infra, 

and take such action as is appropriate.

3.2COMITY


In enforcing the antitrust laws, the Agencies consider international comity. Comity itself reflects the broad concept
of respect among co-equal sovereign nations and plays a role in determining ``the recognition which one nation allows
within its territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation.''
<FOOTCITE>60</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, in determining whether to assert jurisdiction to investigate or bring an action, or to seek particular remedies
in a given case, each Agency takes into account whether significant interests of any foreign sovereign would be affected.

The Agencies have agreed to consider the legitimate interests of other nations in accordance with the recommendations
of the OECD and various bilateral agreements, see Section 2.9 

supra.
</FOOTNOTE>


In performing a comity analysis, the Agencies take into account all relevant factors. Among others, these may include:
(1) the relative significance to the alleged violation of conduct within the United States, as compared to conduct
abroad; (2) the nationality of the persons involved in or affected by the conduct; (3) the presence or absence of a purpose
to affect U.S. consumers, markets, or exporters; (4) the relative significance and foreseeability of the effects
of the conduct on the United States as compared to the effects abroad; (5) the existence of reasonable expectations
that would be furthered or defeated by the action; (6) the degree of conflict with foreign law or articulated foreign
economic policies; (7) the effect on foreign enforcement; and (8) the effectiveness of foreign enforcement.
The relative weight that each factor should be given depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. With respect
to the factor concerning foreign law, the Supreme Court made clear in Hartford Fire


<FOOTCITE>62</FOOTCITE>
 that no conflict exists for purposes of an international comity analysis in the courts if the person subject to regulation
by two states can comply with the laws of both. Bearing this in mind, the Agencies first ask what laws or policies of the
arguably interested foreign jurisdictions are implicated by the conduct in question. There may be no actual conflict
between the antitrust enforcement interests of the United States and the laws or policies of a foreign sovereign.
This is increasingly true as more countries adopt antitrust or competition laws that are compatible with those of
the United States. In these cases, the anticompetitive conduct in question may also be prohibited under the pertinent
foreign laws, and thus the only possible conflict would relate to enforcement practices or remedy. If the laws or policies
of a foreign nation are neutral, it is again possible for the parties in question to comply with the U.S. prohibition
without violating foreign law. Of course, the Agencies take into account comity factors beyond whether there is a
conflict with foreign law. For example, in deciding whether or not to challenge an alleged antitrust violation, the
Agencies would, as part of a comity analysis, consider whether one country either encourages a certain course of conduct
or wishes to leave parties free to choose among different strategies, while another opts to prohibit some of those
strategies.

</FOOTNOTE>


In lieu of bringing an enforcement action, or course, the Agencies may consult with interested foreign sovereigns
through appropriate diplomatic channels to attempt to eliminate anticompetitive effects in the United States.
If, however, the United States decides to prosecute an antitrust action, such a decision represents a determination
by the Executive Branch that the importance of antitrust enforcement outweighs any relevant foreign policy concerns.
<FOOTCITE>63</FOOTCITE>
 The Department does not believe that it is the role of the courts to ``second-guess the executive branch's judgment
as to the proper role of comity concerns under these circumstances.
<FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>
 To date, no Commission cases have presented this issue. It is important also to note that in disputes between private
parties, many courts are willing to undertake a comity analysis.

Illustrative Example I




Situation: 

A group of buyers in one foreign country decide that they will agree on the price that they will offer to suppliers of
a particular product that they procure from overseas. Major suppliers of that product are located in the United States
and the agreement results in substantial loss of sales and capacity reductions in the United States.


Discussion: 

From a jurisdictional point of view, the FTAIA standard appears to be satisfied because the effects on U.S. exporters
presented here are direct and the percentage of supply accounted for by the buyers' cartel is substantial given the
fact that the U.S. suppliers are ``major.'' The Agencies, however, would also take into consideration the comity
aspects presented before deciding whether or not to proceed.
Consistent with its consideration of comity and its obligations under various international agreements, the Agencies
would ordinarily notify the antitrust authority in the cartel's home country. If that authority were in a better position
to address the competitive problem, and were prepared to take effective action to address the adverse effects on U.S.
commerce, the Agencies would consider working cooperatively with the foreign authority or staying their own remedy
pending enforcement efforts by the foreign country. In deciding whether to proceed, the Agencies would weigh the
factors relating to comity set forth above. Factors weighing in favor of bringing such an action include the substantial
harm caused by the cartel to the United States and the fact that the foreign parties purposefully availed themselves
of the benefits of doing business in and with the United States.


3.3Effects of Foreign Government Involvement


Foreign governments may be involved in a variety of ways in conduct that may have antitrust consequences. To address
the implications of such foreign governmental involvement, Congress and the courts have developed four special
doctrines: The doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity; the doctrine of foreign sovereign compulsion; the act of
state doctrine; and the application of the 

Noerr-Pennington 

doctrine to immunize the lobbying of foreign governments. Although these doctrines are interrelated, for purposes
of discussion the Guidelines discuss each one individually.


3.31Foreign Sovereign Immunity


The scope of immunity of a foreign government or its agencies and instrumentalities (hereinafter foreign government)
<FOOTCITE>66</FOOTCITE>
 from the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts for all causes of action, including antitrust, is governed by the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (``FSIA'').
<FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>
 Subject to the treaties in place at the time of FSIA's enactment, a foreign government is immune from suit except where
designated in the FSIA.
<FOOTCITE>68</FOOTCITE>



<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
66

</FOOTNAME>
Section 1603(b) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 defines an ``agency or instrumentality of a foreign
state'' to be any entity ``(1) which is a separate legal person, corporate or otherwise; and (2) which is an organ of
a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, or a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned
by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof; and (3) which is neither a citizen of a State of the United States
as defined in Section 1332 (c) and (d) of [Title 28, U.S. Code], nor created under the laws of any third country.'' 28
U.S.C. 1603(b) (1988). It is not uncommon in antitrust cases to see state-owned enterprises meeting this definition.

(d) Acquired rights to U.S. property,
(e) Committed certain torts within the United States, or agreed to arbitration of a dispute.
