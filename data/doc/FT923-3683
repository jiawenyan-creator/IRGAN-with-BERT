FT  11 SEP 92 / Arctic seas show 'no N-radiation'
THE first Western researchers to investigate the Arctic waters north of
Russia for nuclear waste said yesterday that preliminary tests showed no
radiation from such waste believed dumped by the Soviet Union, AP reports
from Oslo.
A Norwegian-Russian team returned to Kirkenes in Arctic Norway yesterday
after a three-week expedition in the Kara Sea, a formerly closed area near
Russian naval bases and a nuclear weapons test site, the Norwegian news
agency NTB reported.
A Norwegian official said the scientists were only allowed to take samples
at 11 points selected by the Russians, and were denied access to the most
interesting areas.
Greenpeace has claimed that the Soviets dumped 17,000 containers of atomic
waste, as well as 15 nuclear reactors, in the Arctic oceans. Mr Aleksander
Mikhailov, a nuclear safety official in the Russian port of Murmansk, has
said that the Soviet Union dumped radioactive waste in the Kara Sea as
recently as last summer.
