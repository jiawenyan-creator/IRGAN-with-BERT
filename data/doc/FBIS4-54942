  [Text] The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], which was 
victorious in the first round of the elections, maintains the 
right to decide who is to be prime minister, Zoltan Gal, head of 
the MSZP deputies in the previous parliament, has said. He 
added that the MSZP would not begin coalition talks before the 
second round. 
  MSZP Executive Deputy Chairman Imre Szekeres said that every 
election alliance collapsed after the first round and that the 
liberal bloc accord did not endanger the efforts of the 
Socialists to find a coalition partner. 
  The same view was expressed by MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn, who 
is recovering in the hospital and who said his health was better 
now than during the past days. 
  Gabor Kuncze, member of the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ] and candidate for prime minister, said that the SZDSZ 
had a chance in the second round to halt the sweeping victory of 
the Socialists and to prevent the continuation of a covert one 
party system in Hungary. The SZDSZ's candidate for premier did 
not reply to the question of whether they were willing to form a 
coalition with the Socialists, but he immediately added that the 
MSZP would certainly be unable to form a government alone. 
Gabor Kuncze expressed the hope that the individual 
constituency candidates of the Federation of Young Democrats and 
the Agrarian Alliance would withdraw their candidacies in favor 
of the SZDSZ in the second round.
