FT  10 JUN 92 / Lafontaine fights for his political survival
MR OSKAR Lafontaine, enfant terrible of Germany's opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) and lately candidate for German Chancellor, was
yesterday fighting for his political life.
For an hour in front of the parliament of his native Saarland, the abrasive
and frequently mischievous deputy leader of the SPD sought to prove that he
was not guilty of bending the rules of official pension rights to gain a
tidy windfall of around DM100,000 (Pounds 34,364).
He even produced two charts, with red lines and black lines to show his
actual and potential income, to prove that he was facing nothing more than a
'dirty character assassination campaign' by his political opponents.
The charge against Mr Lafontaine, raised to the level of a no confidence
debate in the Saarland parliament, where he is prime minister, is that he
managed to draw a full pension from the age of 42, in addition to his
ministerial salary, thanks to his former position as mayor of Saarbrucken.
The accusation, first published in the magazine Der Spiegel, comes on top of
a series of reports about extravagant spending by the tiny German state,
which is dominated by declining coal and steel industries.
The magazine reported that the Saarland premier, aged only 48, had
nonetheless drawn a pension as mayor on top of his DM18,000 monthly salary
and DM7,000 monthly expenses as a member of parliament.
Mr Lafontaine now must wait until tomorrow to see if he will survive the
probable vote of no confidence.
