  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel expects the NATO summit in Brussels on 10 January to make 
a decision of general principle on the expansion of the alliance 
to include the states of East and Central Europe. Germany would 
act as an advocate for these countries in this process, Kinkel 
assured his Polish counterpart Andrzej Olechowski in Bonn today 
during talks lasting about two hours. However, complete 
membership will not happen quite as fast as the Central and East 
European countries wish. Cooperation without the guarantee of 
mutual assistance is conceivable, to start with. Joint 
maneuvers could also be considered. 
  Olechowski said his country wants to join NATO so that 
Poland 
can get out of the "grey zone." History had shown that if 
Poland stays in that zone, the consequences could be disastrous. 
Poland expects the NATO summit to offer it definite and 
specific prospects for membership. However, the Poles are also 
aware that systems as complex as NATO cannot be joined 
"overnight." Poland also does not want Russia to feel isolated 
by Poland's membership of NATO.
