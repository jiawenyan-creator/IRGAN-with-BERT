FT  14 DEC 94 / Bank bail-out under fire
Japan's trade minister has attacked a central bank-led rescue of two
troubled credit companies in remarks which analysts said reflected concern
about using public funds to bail out financial institutions. 'If I had been
told about the recent rescue package before the announcement, I would not
have agreed to that,' Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto (left), minister of international
trade and industry, told a news conference. The Bank of Japan, in its first
such emergency bail-out of private lending institutions, announced on Friday
that it would join private banks to set up a bank to rescue two ailing
credit companies saddled with bad loans - the bulk inherited from the
bursting of the nation's late 1980s 'bubble' economy. The central bank said
the Tokyo-based institutions, Anzen Credit Bank and Tokyo Kyowa Credit
Association, had total bad assets of Y100bn (Pounds 641m).
