SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS; 
CONNORS LEADS HART TO VICTORY OVER EL MODENA 
In a matchup of junior quarterbacks, Hart High's Ryan Connors outperformed El 
Modena's Jose Prado to lead the Indians past the Vanguards, 14-7, in the 
quarterfinal round of the Southern Section Division III playoffs. 
Hart (9-3) will play top-seeded Esperanza, a 31-7 winner over Leuzinger, in the 
semifinals next Friday night. 
Connors completed 14 of 25 passes for 218 yards and a touchdown, although three 
passes were intercepted. Prado was nine for 16 for 134 yards with one 
interception and fumbled inside the Hart one to end a scoring opportunity in 
the second quarter. 
Connors started the game quickly. After Hart took the opening kickoff, he 
passed 50 yards to Doug Distaso and then 30 yards to Brian Bernier for the 
touchdown with just 34 seconds elapsed. 
El Modena (8-4) answered at the end of the first quarter on a two-yard 
touchdown run by Adam Garcia and had another chance to score moments later. 
After the kickoff, El Modena's Tim Gray intercepted at the Hart 45 and returned 
the ball almost to the goal line. But on first down and inches, Prado fumbled 
the snap, and Hart recovered on the El Modena 3. The Vanguards never again 
threatened. 
Hart finally broke the tie with a 12-play, 70-yard drive. HEATHER SMALLEY
