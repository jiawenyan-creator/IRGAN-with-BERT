  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] announced on 10 January that it will start to phase out 
the wide-ranging voluntary export restraint [VER] governing 
textile exports to the United States, the European Union (EU), 
and Southeast Asia in 1994. It plans to reduce export permit 
applications, numbering 310,000 annually at present, to 50,000 
in 1995, representing an 84-percent cut. 
  The agreement reached at the new multilateral trade 
negotiations (the Uruguay Round) provides for the abolition of 
the VER on textiles in 10 years. The MITI has decided to do 
away with the VER ahead of schedule. 
  Japan continued to impose the VER even after the Japan-U.S. 
textile agreement (1974-1991) and the multilateral fiber 
agreement (MFA) had expired "to avoid friction." However, Japan 
made the decision to end the restriction because it has now 
become an importer of textiles, and its textile exports cannot 
compete with those of developing countries. 
  In concrete terms, numerical quotas for exports to the 
United 
States and the EU, except for certain synthetic fibers, will be 
scrapped by the end of 1994, switching to a simple export permit 
system. The VER covers 95 percent of Japanese textile exports 
to the United States. MITI plans to reduce this to 28 percent 
of the total by 1995. 
  Furthermore, the following steps will be taken to promote 
eventual complete liberalization: 1) The permit system will be 
abolished for textile exports to Southeast Asia by the end of 
1994; 2) exports to Canada will move from numerical restrictions 
to a permit system in 1994, and the permit system will also be 
scrapped by the end of 1994; and 3) the permit system will be 
abolished for exports to East Europe and the Middle East by the 
end of 1994.
