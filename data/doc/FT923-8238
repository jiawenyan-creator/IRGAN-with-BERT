FT  12 AUG 92 / UN hears charges against Iraqis
BRITAIN called on the Iraqi government last night to end its blockade of
Kurdish enclaves in the north, halt repression of Shia Moslems in the south
and allow the United Nations to operate freely throughout the country.
At a special meeting of the UN Security Council, Sir David Hannay, the UK
delegate, termed 'horrific' reports of attacks on Shia villages in the
southern marshes, including for the first time bombing by the Iraqi air
force.
Mr Max van der Stoel, former Dutch foreign minister now serving as a special
UN human rights investigator, told the Council that the only way to avoid a
'new human tragedy' was through a massive international aid programme.
At present, Baghdad's policy made it virtually impossible for relief
organisations to operate. This was in violation of UN resolutions, and
thousands of lives were at stake.
Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari, the Iraqi delegate, scoffed at the charges, calling
them 'half-truths'.
The Council adjourned without taking formal action, but members agreed to
keep the problem under review.
Diplomatic sources said the meeting was in part an effort to impress on
Baghdad the need to renew a 'memorandum of understanding' for continuing UN
operations, including a presence of some 500 UN guards.
