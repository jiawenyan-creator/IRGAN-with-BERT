FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Regionals' results confirm
strength of US banking
THREE large regional US banks - the Bank of New York, Keycorp and
Continental Bank - reported strong growth in third-quarter earnings
yesterday, providing fresh evidence that the nation's banking industry
remains in robust health.
The Bank of New York, the 17th-largest in the country, reported a 45 per
cent rise in profits to a record Dollars 151m.
Return on equity, an important measure of profitability, climbed to 15.95
per cent, from 12.65 per cent last year
The bank said that several factors had contributed to the improvement,
including contributions to earnings from the recently-acquired National
Community Banks group and from 62 branches bought from Barclays Bank of New
York.
Other positive factors included strong fee income - especially from the
processing of credit cards and securities - and a widening in interest rate
spreads, which followed a further shift in the bank's asset mix toward
high-yielding assets and a reduction in the level of non-performing assets.
Keycorp reported a 31.4 per cent improvement in its third quarter profits to
Dollars 102.6m, and return on equity of 18.44 per cent, up from 16.01 per
cent a year earlier.
The New York State-based bank will join forces next year with Society
Corporation of Cleveland in a Dollars 3.9bn merger that will create the
country's 10th largest bank.
It said that fee income rose almost 9 per cent to Dollars 117.6m in the
quarter.
Contributions from two recently-acquired banks lifted its average earning
assets to Dollars 28.9bn and its net interest income to Dollars 389.9m.
Continental Bank of Chicago reported a 28 per cent jump in third-quarter
profits to Dollars 68m, and return on equity of 16.4 per cent, up from 14.4
per cent in 1992.
The highlights of the quarter were big increases in trading profits and
equity investment revenues.
In New York, Bank of New York shares closed down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 56
7/8 , while Keycorp was down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 36 1/8 and Continental
had slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 28.
