FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: WPP sees recovery as profits fall 89% after
exceptionals
MR MARTIN SORRELL, chief executive of WPP Group, the marketing services
company where shareholders approved a capital restructuring last week, said
that there were some early signs of a recovery in media advertising.
He said he had been encouraged by the group's trading in recent months,
although it was hard to tell whether that might be a pulling forward of
business because of the Olympic Games. New business billings of Pounds 475m
(Pounds 440m) were won in the first half.
His comments accompanied interim results which were in line with forecasts
made in the restructuring circular. WPP shares rose 1p to 38p.
Profits before exceptional items were Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 13m), in line
with the forecast of profits in excess of Pounds 14.2m.
Net exceptional charges of Pounds 12.7m, compared with gains of Pounds 3m
from asset sales, included costs of Pounds 13.5m associated with the
refinancing. That left a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.82m (Pounds 16m).
Turnover was up 6.2 per cent to Pounds 2.5bn (Pounds 2.35bn) and group
revenues rose 3.3 per cent to Pounds 601.1m.
The US and UK operations, which make up two thirds of the business, suffered
revenue falls of 2 per cent and 5 per cent respectively, but rose by 6 per
cent in continental Europe and 8 per cent in the rest of the world.
Margins fell slightly from 6 per cent to 5.8 per cent, and Mr Sorrell said
he aimed to cut staff costs as a proportion of revenues and reduce excess
property costs. Staff numbers fell by 5 per cent to 20,631.
Losses per share were 8.9p (nil) but on a pro-forma basis, taking account of
the restructuring, and before exceptional items, earnings per share would
have been 5.1p or 2.7p fully diluted.
