MISSING MANNERS 
Recently we attended a concert at the Universal Amphitheater and we were 
surrounded by talkers and smokers. 
Why these people pay good money to talk through a concert is beyond me. But 
could they please do it somewhere else? Some of us actually buy concert tickets 
to hear the concert. 
We asked the smoker to put out his cigarette since it was a nonsmoking 
auditorium, and he wanted to fight over it. I had to get an usher, who escorted 
him outside to finish smoking. When he returned he had the nerve to ask for our 
binoculars. Did I miss something here?
