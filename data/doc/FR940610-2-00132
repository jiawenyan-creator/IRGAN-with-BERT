The Department notes that Prohibited Transaction Exemption (PTE) 831 (48 FR 895, January 7, 1983) a class exemption
for mortgage pool investment trusts, would generally apply to trusts containing single-family residential mortgages,
provided that the applicable conditions of PTE 831 are met. NatWest and its affiliates request relief for single-family
residential mortgages in this exemption because it would prefer one exemption for all trusts of similar structure.
However, NatWest and its affiliates have stated that they may still avail themselves of the exemptive relief provided
by PTE 831.

Guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificates are mortgage-backed securities with respect to which interest
and principal payable is guaranteed by the Governmental National Mortgage Association (GNMA), the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), or the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA). The Department's regulation
relating to the definition of plan assets (29 CFR 2510.3101(i)) provides that where a plan acquires a guaranteed
governmental mortgage pool certificate, the plan's assets include the certificate and all of its rights with respect
to such certificate under applicable law, but do not, solely by reason of the plan's holding of such certificate, include
any of the mortgages underlying such certificate. The applicant is requesting exemptive relief for trusts containing
guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificates because the certificates in the trusts may be plan assets.

3. Commercial mortgage investment trusts may include mortgages on ground leases or real property. Commercial mortgages
are frequently secured by ground leases on the underlying property, rather than by fee simple interests. The separation
of the fee simple interest and the ground lease interest is generally done for tax reasons. Properly structured, the
pledge of the ground lease to secure a mortgage provides a lender with the same level of security as would be provided
by a pledge of the related fee simple interest. The terms of the ground leases pledged to secure leasehold mortgages
will in all cases be at least ten years longer than the term of such mortgages.

Trust assets may also include obligations that are secured by leasehold interests on residential real property.

Trust Structure


4. Each trust is established under a pooling and servicing agreement between a sponsor, a servicer and a trustee. The
sponsor or servicer of a trust selects assets to be included in the trust. These assets are receivables which may have
been originated, in the ordinary course of business, by a sponsor or servicer of the trust, an affiliate of the sponsor
or servicer, or by an unrelated lender and subsequently acquired by the trust sponsor or servicer.
On or prior to the closing date, the sponsor acquires legal title to all assets selected for the trust, establishes
the trust and designates an independent entity as trustee. On the closing date, the sponsor conveys to the trust legal
title to the assets, and the trustee issues certificates representing fractional undivided interests in the trust
assets. NatWest, or one or more broker-dealers (which may include NatWest), acts (or may act in the future) as underwriter
or placement agent with respect to the sale of the certificates. In addition, NatWest anticipates privately placing
certificates on both a firm commitment and an agency basis.
Certificateholders are entitled to receive monthly, quarterly or semi-annually installments of principal and/or
interest, or lease payments due on the receivables, adjusted, in the case of payments of interest, to a specified rate_the
pass-through rate_which may be fixed or variable.
When installments or payments are made on a semi-annual basis, funds are not permitted to be commingled with the servicer's
assets for longer than would be permitted for a monthly-pay security. A segregated account is established in the name
of the trustee (on behalf of certificateholders) to hold funds received between distribution dates. The account
is under the sole control of the trustee, who invests the account's assets in short-term securities which have received
a rating comparable to the rating assigned to the certificates. In some cases, the servicer may be permitted to make
a single deposit into the account once a month. When the servicer makes such monthly deposits, payments received from
obligors by the servicer may be commingled with the servicer's assets during the month prior to deposit. In no event
will the period of time between the receipt of funds by the servicer and deposit of these funds in a segregated account
exceed 45 days. Furthermore, in those cases where distributions are made semi-annually, the servicer will furnish
a report on the operation of the trust to the trustee on a monthly basis. At or about the time this report is delivered
to the trustee, it will be made available to certificateholders and delivered to or made available to each rating agency
that has rated the certificates.
5. Some of the certificates will be multi-class certificates. NatWest requests exemptive relief for two types of
multi-class certificates: ``Strip'' certificates and ``fast-pay/slow-pay'' certificates. Strip certificates
are a type of security in which the stream of interest payments on receivables is split from the flow of principal payments
and separate classes of certificates are established, each representing rights to disproportionate payments of
principal and interest.

It is the Department's understanding that where a plan invests in REMIC ``residential'' interest certificates to
which this exemption applies, some of the income received by the plan as a result of such investment may be considered
unrelated business taxable income to the plan, which is subject to income tax under the Code. The Department emphasizes
that the prudence requirements of section 404(a)91)(B) of the Act would require plan fiduciaries to carefully consider
this and other tax consequences prior to causing plan assets to be invested in certificates pursuant to this exemption.


</FOOTNOTE>


``Fast-pay/slow-pay'' certificates involve the issuance of classes of certificates having different stated maturities
or the same maturities with different payment schedules. Interest and/or principal payments received on the underlying
receivables are distributed first to the class of certificates having the earliest stated maturity of principal
and/or earlier payment schedule, and only when that class of certificates has been paid in full (or has received a specified
amount) will distributions be made with respect to the second class of certificates. Distributions on certificates
having later stated maturities will proceed in like manner until all the certificateholders have been paid in full.
The only difference between this multi-class pass-through arrangement and a single-class pass-through arrangement
is the order in which distributions are made to certificateholders. In each case, certificateholders will have a
beneficial ownership interest in the underlying assets. In neither case will the rights of a plan purchasing certificates
be subordinated to the rights of another certificateholder in the event of default on any of the underlying obligations.
In particular, if the amount available for distribution to certificateholders is less than the amount required to
be so distributed, all senior certificateholders will share in the amount distributed on pro rata basis.

</FOOTNAME>
If a trust issue subordinate certificates, holders of such subordinate certificates may not share in the amount distributed
on a pro rata basis. The Department notes that the exemption does not provide relief for plan investment in such subordinated
certificates.
