MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO 
Same Ol' Morning: Don't set your alarms to watch the new longer version of 
KCBS' local morning news. Last week KCBS-TV Channel 2 announced plans for an 
hourlong newscast that would bump the "CBS Morning News" at 6:30 a.m., but the 
announcement was too hasty. CBS executives did not approve the plan, and KCBS' 
30-minute news program will continue per usual, a station spokeswoman said.
