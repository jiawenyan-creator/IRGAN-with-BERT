FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sale charge and falling prices
push Noranda into red
NORANDA, the big Canadian resource group, has run into the red with a
first-half loss of CDollars 30m (USDollars 23.4m), or 32 cents a share,
against profits of CDollars 49m, or 10 cents, last time.
The group has been hit by declining commodity prices and a CDollars 30m
charge on the sale of its 49 per cent stake in MacMillan Bloedel. Revenues
were CDollars 2.6bn, down from CDollars 4.3bn, reflecting the MacMillan
Bloedel disposal.
The second-quarter loss this year equalled 7 cents a share against a profit
of 9 cents. The lower Canadian dollar and lower interest expense partly
offset weak prices for metals, papers and oil and gas.
The sale of the MacMillan stake has reduced Noranda's long-term debt to
CDollars 2.9bn.
Loblaw, Canada's biggest grocer, had a second-quarter profit of CDollars
24.3m, or 28 cents a share, up from CDollars 10.8m, or 11 cents. Sales were
CDollars 2.16bn, against CDollars 2.12bn. Price competition in western
Canada and a US strike hurt results.
Torstar, the publishing group, earned CDollars 2.6m, or 6 cents a share, in
the second quarter, down from CDollars 12.6m, or 31 cents. Revenues were
CDollars 229m, against CDollars 218m. A weak advertising market adversely
affected the Toronto Star newspaper, while books improved slightly.
Fletcher Challenge Canada earned CDollars 6.1m, or 5 cents a share, in the
fourth-quarter to end-June, against a loss of CDollars 20.1m, or 30 cents, a
year earlier. For all 1993, FCC made a loss of CDollars 24.2m, against a
loss of CDollars 43.5m, on revenues up 28 per cent at CDollars 1.23bn.
Falconbridge, Canada's second biggest nickel producer, has sold its 62 per
cent control of Falconbridge Gold, its remaining gold mining subsidiary, for
CDollars 22m. The buyer is Kinross Gold, a new Toronto mining group, for
CDollars 22m. With the deal go producing mines in Zimbabwe and at Timmins in
northern Ontario.
Kinross is buying 8.2m Falconbridge gold common shares and a CDollars 7.4 m
convertible debenture. Kinross is 25 per cent held by Placer Dome and 23.5
per cent by Dundee Bankcorp. The two companies will have 1993 gold
production of about 150,000 oz.
Kinross has said it would like to buy the remaining 38 per cent of
Falconbridge Gold.
