FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Canada airlines deadlock
Air Canada and Canadian Airlines have failed to settle their quarrel over
airline industry restructuring after nearly three weeks of face to face
negotiations.
'The parties have very serious business differences that remain unresolved,'
said Mr Stanley Hartt, the lawyer called in by both sides to act as a
facilitator.
The deadlock means several key issues will go before the courts, while
Canadian Airlines and PWA, its parent company, arrange CDollars 213m
(USDollars 159m) of interim financing to stay in business until they receive
a CDollars 246m equity infusion from American Airlines.
The talks focused mainly on the jointly-owned Gemini reservation system.
Canadian Airlines must switch to American's Sabre system to qualify for the
equity infusion.
Air Canada maintains Canadian Airlines is contracted as a Gemini shareholder
until 1997.
Canadian Airlines is making a new offer to settle the Gemini issue, but
refused to disclose details until Air Canada has studied it.
It said the deadline for American's equity infusion has been extended to
June 30 1994. American would get 25 per cent control of Canadian Airlines in
return.
Canadian Airlines plans to find ways of exiting from Gemini without causing
its collapse.
If Air Canada refuses the latest undisclosed offer, Gemini would be
dissolved and recreated in another form since it owns Canada's largest
private telecommunications system.
Air Canada has offered in excess of CDollars 1.1bn, including CDollars 250m
cash, for Canadian Airlines' foreign routes. It includes CDollars 250m in
cash and up to CDollars 800m in relief of debt or lease obligations for
three Boeing 747 and five Boeing 767 aircraft.
