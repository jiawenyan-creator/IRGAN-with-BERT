FT  28 OCT 93 / Firm backing for Airbus reform call
BRITISH Aerospace and Deutsche Aerospace yesterday backed a call by the
managing director of Airbus Industrie that the four-nation consortium be
reorganised.
Mr Jean Pierson had called for work to begin on 'reforming the structure' of
Airbus. If this did not happen urgently, Airbus risked losing clients to
more efficient competitors, said Mr Pierson.
Backing this call, an executive in one of the Airbus partners said that Mr
Pierson's open expression of support for moves to transform Airbus from a
consortium into a limited company meant that the change 'might come sooner
than some expect'.
Airbus is a consortium made up of France's Aerospatiale, British Aerospace,
Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (Casa) of Spain and the Deutsche Airbus unit
of Germany's Daimler-Benz. Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) said that Mr Pierson
was echoing a call by its head, Mr Jurgen Schrempp.
The company said the four Airbus partners would discuss Mr Pierson's
initiative and make a decision on the timing of a move to a limited company
status.
BAe said it had been pressing for such a change for several years. The
change would mean Airbus would take over the legal ownership of its own
assets, currently the property of the consortium partners.
This would allow for better cost control, said BAe. The company pointed out,
however, that the structure of the consortium had allowed the company to be
created and prosper.
It is now the world's second biggest passenger aircraft maker behind Boeing
and ahead of McDonnell Douglas, both of the US.
Mr Pierson said on Tuesday that 1993 'had been a disaster' for the
organisation, with falling orders.
