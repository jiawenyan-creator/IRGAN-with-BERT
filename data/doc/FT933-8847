FT  13 AUG 93 / Pension-at-50 option for miners
MINERS WILL now be able to receive a pension-at-50 option after the
Mineworkers' Pension Scheme yesterday accepted British Coal's proposed
changes in the mining industry's occupational pension scheme.
The age at which the adjusted pension can be paid is to be reduced from 55
to 50.
It will be backdated to cover miners who have left the industry since March
1 last year but who did not receive an immediate pension on doing so.
