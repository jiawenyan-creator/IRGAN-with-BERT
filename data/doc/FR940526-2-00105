 

Runzheimer excluded expenditure data for homeowning families without a mortgage because they were not typical of
homeowners in the base area or in the allowance areas with the largest concentrations of federal employees.
The 1988 CES was also used to identify which home-maintenance items to price and to establish the relative importance
of those items.


4.2.2Development of Housing Profiles


To compare housing costs accurately in all locations, Runzheimer constructed a model to measure housing costs under
six different circumstances; that is, we identified six typical housing profiles and matched these profiles to three
income levels, as shown in the table below. Runzheimer and OPM agreed that at least one criterion for the owner profile
should be the square footage of the home and at least one criterion for the renter profile should be the number of bedrooms
in the rental unit. The profiles for homeowners and renters are:

732 1,700 sq. ft. detached house.

1Defined as ``Total rooms_Bedrooms_Baths and representative size.'' Total rooms excludes bathrooms, hallways,
entrance areas, and closets but includes bedrooms, living room, family room, kitchen, formal dining room, and den/study.
The representative size is roughly the midpoint size for the range of housing surveyed at the income level.

2Row houses may be used in Northeast Washington, DC, where the availability of single family detached homes is limited.

4.2.3Living Community Selection


Runzheimer surveyed the same living communities and data sources for the summer 1993 survey as it did for the 19921993
study with the following exceptions:
