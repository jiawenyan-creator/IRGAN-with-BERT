FT  22 SEP 92 / World News In Brief: Convicted consultant 'devastated'
Hospital consultant Nigel Cox, left, said he was 'devastated' at being given
a one-year suspended jail sentence for ending the life of a terminally ill
patient. Dr Cox, 47, said: 'It seems somewhat harsh to criminalise me for
doing my best in what were quite exceptional circumstances.' He said he
would continue to see his patients 'if and until there is a hearing by the
General Medical Council'.
