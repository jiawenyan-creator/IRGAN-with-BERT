  [Text] Moscow April 1 TASS -- A number of State Duma 
factions opposed today Thursday's suspension of the SOVETSKAYA 
ROSSIYA newspaper's release by the Pressa Publishing House for 
systematic non-payments for printing services and paper. 
  The Communist, Agrarian and "Russian Way" Factions described 
the printers' demand for payment as "unlawful persecution and 
publishers' racket".
