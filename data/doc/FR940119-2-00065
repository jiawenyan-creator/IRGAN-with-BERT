Revised Schedule of Remuneration for the UCX Program



Under section 8521(a)(2) of title 5 of the United States Code, the Secretary of Labor is required to issue from time
to time a Schedule of Remuneration specifying the pay and allowances for each pay grade of members of the military services.
The schedules are used to calculate the base period wages and benefits payable under the program of Unemployment Compensation
for Ex-servicemembers (UCX Program).

The revised schedule published with this Notice reflects increases in military pay and allowances which were effective
in January 1994.

Accordingly, the following new Schedule of Remuneration, issued pursuant to 20 CFR 614.12, applies to ``First Claims''
for UCX which are effective beginning with the first day of the first week which begins after April 2, 1994.
