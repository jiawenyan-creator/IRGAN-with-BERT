 

The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive.
Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would
not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft
in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD
is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the
required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD.

A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft
must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA
makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining
those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial.
When the FAA, as in this AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that this cost-beneficial level of safety
is no longer being achieved and that the required actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this
level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this AD would
be redundant and unnecessary.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Adoption of the Amendment



Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration
amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows:



PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES



1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89.



39.13


[Amended]



2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:






941209Boeing:

 Amendment 398937. Docket 93NM139AD.






Applicability: 

Model 747 series airplanes, line positions 001 through 200 inclusive, certificated in any category.



Compliance: 

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.

To prevent rapid decompression of the airplane and the inability to carry fail-safe loads, accomplish the following:

(a) Within 1,000 flight cycles after the effective date of this AD, and thereafter at the intervals specified in paragraphs
(a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this AD, perform inspections at the upper lobe skin panel lap joints in accordance with
Boeing Service Bulletin 747532307, Revision 2, dated October 14, 1993:

(1) Perform a detailed external visual inspection to detect cracks and evidence of corrosion (bulging skin between
fasteners, blistered paint, dished fasteners, popped rivet heads, or loose fasteners) in accordance with the service
bulletin. Repeat that inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 2,000 flight cycles until the modification
required by paragraph (e) of this AD is accomplished.

(2) Perform a high frequency eddy current inspection (HFEC) to detect cracks in the skin at the upper row of fasteners
of the skin panel lap joints forward of body station (BS) 1000 in accordance with the service bulletin. Repeat that
inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 4,000 flight cycles until the modification required by paragraph
(e) of this AD is accomplished.

(3) Perform a HFEC inspection to detect cracks in the skin at the upper row of fastener holes of the skin panel lap joints
aft of BS 1480 to 2360 in accordance with the service bulletin. Repeat that inspection thereafter at intervals not
to exceed 6,000 flight cycles until the modification required by paragraph (e) of this AD is accomplished.

(b) If any crack is found during any inspection required by this AD, or if any corrosion is found for which material loss
exceeds 10 percent of the material thickness, accomplish paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this AD in accordance with
Boeing Service Bulletin 747532307, Revision 2, dated October 14, 1993.

(1) Prior to further flight, repair any crack or corrosion found, in accordance with the service bulletin.

(2) Within 18 months after accomplishing the repair, accomplish the ``full'' modification described in the service
bulletin for the remainder of any skin panel lap joint in which a crack is found, or in which corrosion is found that exceeds
10 percent of the material thickness.

(c) If no crack is found during any inspection required by this AD, but corrosion is found for which the material loss
does not exceed 10 percent of the material thickness: Accomplish paragraph (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this AD for the entire
affected skin panel lap joint in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747532307, Revision 2, dated
October 14, 1993.

(1) Within 500 flight cycles after accomplishing the inspection during which the corrosion was found, and thereafter
at intervals not to exceed 500 flight cycles until the ``full'' modification required by paragraph (c)(2) of this
AD is accomplished: Perform a HFEC inspection to detect cracks of the corroded skin panel lap joint, in accordance
with the service bulletin.

(2) Within 36 months after accomplishing the inspection during which the corrosion was found: Accomplish the ``full''
modification in accordance with the service bulletin.

(d) The inspections required by this AD shall be performed by removing the paint and using an approved chemical stripper;
or by ensuring that each fastener head is clearly visible.

(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this AD, prior to the accumulation of 20,000 total flight cycles, or within
the next 1,000 flight cycles after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later: Accomplish the modification
described in the service bulletin as a ``full'' modification of the skin panel lap joints at the locations specified
in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this AD, as applicable, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747532307,
Revision 2, dated October 14, 1993. Accomplishment of this modification terminates the repetitive inspection requirements
of paragraph (a) of this AD.

(1) For airplane line numbers 001 through 058, inclusive: Modify the skin panel lap joints at Stringer 12 (left and
right), station 520 to 1,000; and Stringer 19 (left and right), station 520 to 740.
