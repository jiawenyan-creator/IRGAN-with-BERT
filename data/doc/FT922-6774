FT  21 MAY 92 / Milan scandal tests Swiss bank secrecy
BANKERS in Lugano have been advised to take legal action to avoid providing
information on accounts held by Italian citizens under investigation by
magistrates in the corruption scandal in Milan.
The decision could embarrass the Swiss authorities, who in recent years have
opened a chink in the country's banking secrecy laws in cases involving
drugs or terrorism.
The move followed a special session of a committee of the Bankers'
Association in the Swiss canton of Ticino, which met on Tuesday to consider
a request from local magistrates for details on various Italian account
holders.
Magistrates in Lugano, which has traditionally served as an off-shore
banking centre for rich northern Italy, have been co-operating with their
Italian counterparts in investigations concerning construction projects in
the city.
The Milanese magistrates have been able to follow a trail of financial
transactions, estimated at up to L150bn (Dollars 120m), part of which is
believed to have gone through accounts in the Swiss city. However, the
requests for information have put both Swiss magistrates and bankers to the
test. They could create a test case on Swiss banking secrecy.
Local bankers have questioned whether the criterion of 'recycled funds',
drawn up in relation to money stemming from drugs and terrorism, is
applicable in the Milan case, which involves a largely institutionalised
form of corruption involving leading figures from the city's main political
parties.
