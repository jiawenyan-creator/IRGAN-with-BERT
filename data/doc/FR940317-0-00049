SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the GOA 
exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce 
according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the 
GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation
and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and
672. 


In accordance with 672.20(c)(1)(ii), the allocation of Pacific cod for the inshore component in the Central
Regulatory Area, GOA, was established by the final 1994 groundfish specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994),
as 28,125 metric tons (mt). 
The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), 
has determined, in accordance with 672.20(c)(2)(ii), that the allocation of Pacific cod total allowable
catch for the inshore component in the Central Regulatory Area, GOA, soon will be reached. The Regional Director established
a directed fishing allowance of 23,625 mt, with consideration that 4,500 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed
fishing for other species in the Central Regulatory Area. The Regional Director has determined that the directed
fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific cod by operators
of vessels catching Pacific cod for processing by the inshore component in the Central Regulatory Area, effective
from 12 noon, A.l.t., March 16, 1994, through 
12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be 
found in the regulations at 672.20(g).
