 

FMC miscalculations that result in excessively high V

 speeds could result in accelerate-stop distances that exceed planned takeoff distances, which may lead to the airplane
departing the end of the runway during a high speed rejected takeoff.

Since the unsafe condition described is likely to exist or develop on other McDonnell Douglas Model MD11 and
MD11F series airplanes of the same type design, the FAA issued telegraphic AD T941951, on September
14, 1994, to supersede AD 940807 and to require a revision to the FAA-approved AFM to ensure that the flight
crews verify the accuracy of data provided by the FMC under all conditions. The AD also requires that V speeds be manually
entered into the FMC.

This is considered to be interim action. The manufacturer of these airplanes, in concert with the manufacturer of
the FMC, is currently developing new software that will address the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. Once this
software is developed, approved, and available, the FAA may consider additional rulemaking.

Additionally, subsequent to the issuance of telegraphic AD T941951, the FAA discovered that a typographical
error appeared in the listing of affected part numbers for the Honeywell FMC's. The part numbers were inadvertently
listed as ``4059040906, 907, and 908.'' The correct part numbers are ``4059050906, 907,
and 908.'' (These correct part numbers were listed correctly in the preamble to the telegraphic AD and in the
previously-issued AD 940807.)

Since it was found that immediate corrective action was required, notice and opportunity for prior public comment
thereon were impracticable and contrary to the public interest, and good cause existed to make the AD effective immediately
by individual telegrams issued on September 14, 1994, to all known U.S. owners and operators of McDonnell Douglas
Model MD11 and MD11F series airplanes. These conditions still exist, and the AD is hereby published
in the 

Federal Register

 as an amendment to section 39.13 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) to make it effective to all persons.
Additionally, this AD revises the telegraphic AD by correcting a typographical error in the listing of FMC part numbers.



Comments Invited



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire.

Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under
the caption 

ADDRESSES. 

All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed.

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94NM160AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption


ADDRESSES.
