FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Write-off cuts Benson to Pounds 65,000
Pre-tax profits of Benson Group, the Wolverhampton-based engineer, fell from
Pounds 817,000 to Pounds 65,000 in the six months to November 30.
The outcome came on turnover up from Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 12.6m and was
after interest payable of Pounds 267,000 (Pounds 269,000) and a transfer to
reserves of Pounds 763,000 to restore goodwill written off in 1989 on an
acquisition since disposed of.
Mr Richard Phillips, chairman, said that during the period much had been
done to improve the quality of earnings in the group's principal businesses.
Profits at the operating level, at Pounds 1.1m, were in line with
expectations and just ahead of last year's figure.
Since the period-end the company had formed a joint venture with Siemens -
Benson Building Technology Systems - and has acquired Diffusion
Environmental Systems from the API Group, he added.
Losses per share came out at 0.04p (0.55p earnings) and the interim dividend
is unchanged at 0.1p.
