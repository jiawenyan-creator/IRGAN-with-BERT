FT  05 OCT 92 / The week ahead
RESULTS DUE
MORE bad news from the recession in construction, property and housing
sectors is expected on Thursday with three victims reporting results.
Higgs and Hill took exceptional charges of Pounds 20.9m and reported a
pre-tax loss in the year to December 31, and is expected to post minimal
interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 500,000-Pounds 800,000. The interim
dividend will likely be slashed to 1.5p (6p).
Ibstock Johnsen, the brick and building materials manufacturer, has also
been having a tough time. Interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m-Pounds 4m
(Pounds 7.2m) are forecast. Its interim dividend also looks under pressure
and could be cut to 1p or even a halfpenny (2.25p). However hopes are
brighter for Tilbury Douglas. Interim profits of Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 6.7m)
are expected and the 10 1/2 p dividend looks safe. The company is expected
to maintain its reputation as one of the few in the construction sector to
be coming through the recession relatively unscathed.
Grampian Holdings, the Scottish mini-conglomerate which set the ball rolling
in the bidding for Macarthy last year, is expected to show on Wednesday an
interim profit on its continuing activities of Pounds 2.5m, down from Pounds
3.4m.
The picture is complicated by the sale of the Mitre business, maker of
footballs and other sporting goods. The largest part of Grampian is the
animal pharmaceuticals division. The performance of the tourist retailing
side is traditionally biased towards the second half.
