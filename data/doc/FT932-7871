FT  21 MAY 93 / Technology: Coded message for lost property - Worth Watching
When disaster strikes - a fire or a bomb - it is difficult to match the
items retrieved from the wreckage to its owner.
An asset management system using bar codes, developed by the Australian
company Hardcat Systems, could make life easier.
Hardcat is a relational database which holds information relating to assets
and cross refers them.
So floppy discs could be labelled with a bar code cross-referenced to the
code of the PC on which they would be used. Hardcat: Australia, 03 696 0188;
UK, 0276 855555.
