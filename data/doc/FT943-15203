FT  11 JUL 94 / People (Names in the News): Cleghorn's sugared path
Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, has been
through a turbulent period over the past three years, writes Bernard Simon.
More upheavals are probably in store following the appointment of John
Cleghorn as the bank's chairman and ceo.
Cleghorn, aged 52, is more brusque but also more down-to-earth than his
urbane predecessor Allan Taylor, who is retiring after 45 years with the
bank. While Taylor is known throughout the bank as Mr Taylor, Cleghorn - who
frequently travels economy class - is simply John.
Cleghorn, an accountant who started working life as a sugar trader in his
native Montreal, has been with the bank for 20 years. His path to the top
became clear eight years ago when he was named president. RBC, with assets
of CDollars 168bn and 47,000 employees, was hit hard by the recession. In
particular, it took a heavy knock from sour loans to the troubled
real-estate and forest-products industries.
More recently, however, falling interest rates, a halting economic recovery
and a strong contribution from the securities business have brought a
turnround. The bank produced a 17 per cent return on equity in the first six
months of its current fiscal year.
Cleghorn spearheaded the acquisition last year of Royal Trust, a failing
trust and loan company. Although the bank swallowed a CDollars 300m charge
to cover the cost of integrating Royal Trust, Cleghorn won praise for
bringing the two institutions together in a relatively trouble-free way.
After he takes over as ceo on November 1, Cleghorn is expected to flatten
the bank's hierarchy and bring more young executives into the top ranks.
Among the issues confronting them will be RBC's failure to carry out its
goal of making a sizeable US acquisition. The bank has so far maintained
that nothing has been available south of the border at a reasonable price.
