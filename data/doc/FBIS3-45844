  [Text] Shanghai, January 20 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai is 
expected to be built into China's largest state bonds market 
this year, according to Wei Wenyuan, general manager of the 
Shanghai Stock Exchange. 
  He said the stock exchange has been authorized by relevant 
departments to implement this year's issue of state bonds 
through a trading and clearing center. 
  He also disclosed that a plan for an open bonds market to 
overseas investors has been brewing, with its aim to introduce 
more foreign funds. 
  Before 1992, the bonds trading volume in Shanghai accounted 
for 30 percent of the country's total. 
  After a year's slowdown, the city decided to recover the 
market in 1993, as a step to restoring its status as a financial 
center for the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Wei said the Shanghai Stock Exchange will open further in 
the 
field, after its successful experiment in state bonds settlement 
last year. 
  He was confident about the prospect of the market, because 
it 
is important for the country in fund collecting and in 
macro-control of banking savings, currency supply and resources 
allocation.
