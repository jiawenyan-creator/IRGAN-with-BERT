  [Text] Taipei, May 16 (CNA) -- A group of independence 
activists on Monday [16 May] vowed to push for the drafting of a 
new constitution, defying warnings by government officials and 
the ruling Kuomintang that doing so would add to the tension 
between Taiwan and Mainland China. 
  Legislator Huang Huang-hsiung of the Democratic Progressive 
Party [DPP], Taiwan's largest opposition party, told the press 
that "the committee of the Taiwanese Constitution movement" will 
hold its second meeting on June 24-25 to discuss the matter. 
  The committee, comprising the World United Formosans for 
Independence (WUFI) and some other independence organizations, 
also plans to carry advertisements in Taiwan's five newspapers 
on Tuesday asking for public submissions on a national anthem 
and flag for the "new republic." 
  An interior ministry official said the committee, created 
last year, has not registered with the government and is 
therefore an illegal civilian body. He said any action taken by 
the organization to promote secessionism would be against the 
law, but he did not elaborate. 
  Chien Han-sheng, chairman of the Kuomintang Taipei 
Committee, 
when asked to comment on the committee's efforts, said: "It 
will create confusion and tension across the Taiwan Strait." 
  Li Ying-yuan, WUFI secretary-general, rebuffed the criticism 
and said the committee will go ahead with its plan as scheduled 
regardless of the government's response.
