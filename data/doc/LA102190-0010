OUTTAKES: SUPER DAVE, THE MOVIE 
Super Dave Osborne, the daredevil stunt man who always fails so dramatically -- 
and comically -- has vaulted from NBC's "Van Dyke and Company" (1974) to 
Showtime's "Bizarre" (1979-1984) to his current variety show, "Super Dave," on 
the cable network. Just last week, he turned up in new Nike network spots aired 
during the World Series. 
And to prove that you can't keep an inept daredevil down, the deadpan Super 
Dave -- actually, Emmy Award-winning writer-performer Bob Einstein -- will now 
attempt a leap to the big screen. 
"We have a deal with Columbia to do a Super Dave movie," reveals Einstein, 
brother of actor-director Albert Brooks. 
Likely premise: a movie-within-a-movie that has serious-minded Super Dave 
turning down a fictitious studio's offer for him to make a wild, 
action-aventure -- but then stumbling into a real-life one anyway. 
In his Showtime series, with new episodes due in January, Einstein spends half 
the program meticulously setting up a daredevil stunt that inevitably 
backfires, crushing or mangling the "Super One." The feature film will exploit 
the same running gag. 
"Negotiations are finished," says Alan Blye, Einstein's writing partner and 
executive producer. "It's now a matter of sitting down and doing it, finding 
the time between the television show and other responsibilities." Daniel Cerone
