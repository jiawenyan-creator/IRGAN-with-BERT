FT  23 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Guinness to invest Pounds 53m at Park Royal
brewery
GUINNESS, the UK-based international drinks group, is planning to invest
Pounds 53m in rebuilding its main UK brewery at Park Royal in West London.
The investment will be phased over four years, with the bulk of expenditure
in the first two to three years. Mr Bill Spears, Guinness's director of
public affairs, said the group planned to used existing banking facilities
to fund the investment.
Guinness's debt will rise only marginally as a result. The group reported
borrowings of Pounds 1bn in its annual results on Thursday, with gearing at
just over 50 per cent. Pre-tax profits rose by 13 per cent to Pounds 956m
for the year to December 31, 1991.
The investment programme, which is due to begin in the next few months, will
mean only a fractional increase in the brewery's capacity of 3m hectolitres
 -or 500m pints - a year, said Mr Spears.
The main benefit would be in reducing costs through improving efficiency and
quality control. 'There is every reason to believe that there will be a
significant reduction in costs per hectolitre,' he said.
The programme will also mean the eventual loss of some of the 1,300 jobs at
the 60-year-old brewery, although Mr Spears said it was too early to
quantify the number of redundancies.
Employee representatives endorsed the plan two weeks ago. 'They appreciate
there will be job losses,' Mr Spears said, 'but also that the plan will
secure in the much longer term the jobs which remain.'
Guinness plans to use the investment programme as a opportunity to increase
efficiency and improve working practices, he said.
The brewery, which is situated on a 30-acre site and produces Guinness
stout, Harp lager and Kaliber, the low alcohol beer, would become the 'most
technologically advanced in the UK' as a result of the investment, Mr Spears
said.
