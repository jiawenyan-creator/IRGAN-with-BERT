FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Corporate Services calls for Pounds 7.5m
Corporate Services, the USM-traded human resources group, yesterday
announced the acquisition for Pounds 10m of three businesses, to be funded
by a Pounds 7.5m rights issue.
Mr Jeffrey Fowler, chairman, said the acquisitions were in line with CSG's
core business of contract labour, employment services and training, and
would be profitable from the outset.
CSCT Holdings, which supplies training courses principally for counsellors
in both the public and private sector, will be acquired for Pounds 4m.
It has guaranteed profits of Pounds 750,000 for the year to April 5. CSCT is
currently the only company in the UK with full accreditation from the
Associated Examining Board.
HeMan Contracts, a supplier of contract labour for the construction
industry, has been bought from Rentokil for Pounds 3m. It incurred a pre-tax
loss last year, but is now profitable.
MTS Group Holdings, which provides technical personnel for the engineering
sector, is being bought for Pounds 3m.
CSG was formed by the reverse takeover of Southwest Resources by Mr Fowler's
ADG in 1990.
Mr Fowler said: 'We spent very heavily on systems and management controls,
and are capable of taking on twice the current level of business on the
existing management resources.'
It has launched a chain of small acquisitions, and Mr Fowler said the
company had paid an average acquisition cost of four times first year
profits.
Following the latest acquisitions, the group should achieve Pounds 80m in
revenues, with about 60 per cent coming from contract labour, and the
remainder fairly evenly split between training and employment services.
The rights is at 52p, on a 5-for-12 basis.
