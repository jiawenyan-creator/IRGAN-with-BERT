FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Wolseley confounds forecasters
THE SHARE price of Wolseley rose 18p to 692p yesterday as the rapidly
expanding UK building materials group again confounded forecasters with
higher than expected profits for the year to July 31.
Pre-tax profits rose by a third to Pounds 121.1m (Dollars 182m) from Pounds
91.3m. Analysts had expected between Pounds 110m and Pounds 115m.
Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman and managing director, said recession had
eased, particularly on the US east coast and the UK.
The figures included 'surprisingly encouraging first-time results' from
Enertech, the Swedish oil and gas burner manufacturer acquired for Pounds
45m in April, which made a trading contribution of Pounds 2.6m.
Other acquisitions made during the year contributed Pounds 1.1m. A currency
benefit added Pounds 5.5m, up from Pounds 0.7m.
The group also reduced costs, although Mr Lancaster gave no details. 'We
have run this business lean and mean for 30 years, and we just run it lean
and mean all the time,' he said.
Turnover increased by 27 per cent from Pounds 1.95bn to Pounds 2.5bn,
including Pounds 69.4m from acquisitions. Of the total, Pounds 1bn derived
from building distribution in Europe; Pounds 1.2bn from building
distribution in the US and Pounds 278.5m from European manufacturing and
other activities.
Mr Lancaster described UK recovery as 'patchy'.
Earnings per share rose from 26.27p to 33.6p. A final dividend of 9.75p
(against 9.45p) is proposed, taking the total for the year to 13.3p, from
12.55p.
