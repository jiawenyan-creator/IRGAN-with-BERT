  [Text] Maseru April 14 SAPA -- Lesotho soldiers on Thursday 
[14 April] night freed four cabinet ministers they had taken 
hostage earlier in the day, a Western diplomat said. He said 
the ministers of justice, education, natural resources and trade 
and industry had been released unharmed. They are Trade 
Minister Shakhane Robong Mokhehle, Natural Resources Minister 
Monyane Moleleki, Education Minister Bethuel Pakalitha Nosisili 
and Justice Minister Kelebone Albert Maope. 
  It was still unclear which soldiers had carried out the 
"arrests", which the diplomat said appeared to have taken senior 
military officers off guard. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Selometsi Baholo was killed earlier on 
Thursday. The diplomat said the circumstances of his death, 
which may have been accidental, remained unclear. The Lesotho 
military is understood to have an outstanding demand for a 100 
per cent pay increase. 
  Diplomats in Maseru said it appeared the military leadership 
had been caught unawares by the kidnapping by lower ranks. 
  Maseru was quiet during the day and on Thursday night. 
  Lesotho's army is understood to have an outstanding demand 
for a 100 per cent wage increase.
