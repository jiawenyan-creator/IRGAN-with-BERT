ARREST ORDER ISSUED FOR CRAZY EDDIE IN STOCK PROFITS CASE 
A federal judge issued an arrest warrant today for Eddie Antar, telling 
marshals to "spare no expense" to locate the founder of the Crazy Eddie chain 
so that he can explain his refusal to hand over $52 million in alleged illegal 
stock profits. 
"I have given this man seven, 14, I believe 16, days to comply with this 
court's order to repatriate the money and to turn it over to a 
trustee-receiver," U.S. District Judge Nicholas Politan said, finding Antar in 
contempt. 
"I ask you to spare no expense. I want this man found." 
Antar's lawyers produced an affidavit signed Tuesday, in which he asserted his 
Fifth Amendment right to avoid testifying against himself. But the judge said 
the privilege could only be taken in person. 
"We're not in a paper chase here. We're in a human chase," Politan said.
