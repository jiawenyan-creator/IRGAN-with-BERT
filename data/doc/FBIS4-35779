<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab, official in </F>
charge of the communications and post portfolio in the 
Palestinian Authority, by Sa'id Mu'addi on 2 June; place not 
given; from the "With the Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab, on your 
way back to the [self-rule] area from Tunis, you met in Jordan 
with Jordanian Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali. What 
took place at this meeting? 
  [Al-Ashhab] The meeting was a courtesy call in our capacity 
as the first [Palestinian] officials arriving in Amman after 
completing the formation of the Palestinian National Authority 
[PNA]. It was a get-acquainted call. We requested to his 
excellency the prime minister that each of the Palestinian 
officials meet with his counterpart in the Jordanian Government 
ministries. 
  The prime minister welcomed this idea, and gave directives 
for meetings with our counterparts in the Jordanian Government 
on the following day. And this, in fact, took place. I met 
with officials from the [Jordanian] Telecommunications 
Corporation and the Ministry of Communications. Likewise, my 
colleague Dr. 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi met with his counterpart the 
[Jordanian] minister of youth. Ilyas Frayj met with the 
minister of tourism. Dr. Zakariya al-Agha met with officials 
from the Ministry of Housing. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Abd-al-Hafiz: What is the Jordanian attitude 
and position on extending aid to the PNA in various fields? 
  [Al-Ashhab] In fact, they expressed great hospitality, and 
said they are ready to extend all that we request. We have 
actually begun to coordinate with them. This is a natural 
matter because, as you know, Jordan used to have a presence here 
[in the occupied territories] before 1967. As an 
institutionalized state, Jordan has wide experience and room for 
coordination with us at the beginning of our work as a PNA. 
  We also agreed to exchange personnel for training, so that 
people from the West Bank will go to institutions in Amman to 
receive training in various fields. We also requested that 
experts be sent from Jordan to the West Bank, so that we can 
cooperate with them on establishing the new Palestinian 
Authority. 
  [Mu'addi] What urgent aid can Jordan extend to the 
Palestinians in this stage? 
  [Al-Ashhab] Jordan can extend aid in various fields. This 
is a new experience for the Palestinians and we need 
cooperation, coordination, and aid from our brothers in the East 
Bank. Naturally, they will not withhold from us anything we 
request in various fields. [passage omitted]
