LOCAL; 
$32-MILLION LOTTO PRIZE EXPECTED 
Nobody won the midweek Lotto jackpot, and state lottery officials estimated 
today that Saturday's grand prize could reach $32 million. 
Wednesday marked the third drawing in a row that the Lotto jackpot went 
unclaimed. Eight tickets had five of six winning numbers plus the bonus to win 
the ticket-holders $323,596 each. The winning numbers picked Wednesday night by 
a Lotto machine for the twice-weekly "Lotto 6-49" game were: 4, 8, 11, 18, 24, 
47 and the bonus number, 23.
