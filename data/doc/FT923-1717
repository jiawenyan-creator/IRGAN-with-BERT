FT  22 SEP 92 / Tube train drivers reject work plan
ASLEF, the train drivers' union, yesterday rejected London Underground's
plan to overhaul working practices, saying that it failed to compensate
drivers fully for the changes.
Aslef said it would ballot members on industrial action should London
Underground try to impose the plan, seen as the most radical for 40 years,
without union agreement.
The two other rail unions, the RMT and the TSSA white-collar workers union,
have told London Underground they need more time to study the plan and
consult their members.
London Underground had set September 30 as the deadline for responses after
a week of intensive negotiations intended to kick-start the stalled talks.
London Underground has offered staff a total of 5.8 per cent in compensation
but the plan means that 29 per cent of the 21,000 staff will suffer a
reduction in wages after two years.
Aslef is asking for pay rises of up to 19 per cent to ensure that the 2,341
train staff affected receive half the amount of money, between Pounds 12.75m
and Pounds 13.56m, that it calculates London Underground will save by
shedding 5,000 staff over five years.
Previous attempts to shake up working practices have failed partly because
of the highly unionised workforce and partly because of the importance of
the network for the London economy.
The three rail unions are meeting in London today to discuss the
negotiations.
Mr Gwynn Evans, London Underground's head of employee relations, said: 'Any
union which leads its members into a dispute over a package as good as ours
and in the current economic climate where many people are just happy to have
any job would be less than wise.'
