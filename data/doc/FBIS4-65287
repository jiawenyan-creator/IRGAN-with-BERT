  [Text] German citizen Hans Koschnick, the European Union 
[EU] administrator of the Bosnian city of Mostar, is in our 
country. First thing this morning he met the foreign minister, 
and now he is meeting Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas. 
Now we go over to Pedro Fernandez Cespedes. Good afternoon. 
  [Cespedes] Good afternoon. While waiting for Croats and 
Muslims to complete the initial agreement that is now being 
discussed in Vienna, Foreign Minister Javier Solana has offered 
Hans Koschnick, the EU administrator of the city of Mostar and 
former mayor of Bremen, all the help that Spain could possibly 
give so as to establish a close working relationship. 
  [Begin Solana recording] The EU has a lot at stake here. Why 
is there so much at stake? Because we have taken on a vast 
responsibility, that of pacifying a city and then rebuilding it. 
And we are not talking about just any city, it is the second 
city in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the first one being Sarajevo -- 
the second one is Mostar. And it has its own specific problems. 
[end recording] 
  [Cespedes] Spanish businessmen will work toward the 
rebuilding of Mostar, a city they have already visited. This is 
going to be the reward for the big effort made by Spain in 
former Yugoslavia. Fifty Civil Guardsmen might take part in the 
future police force deployed in the capital of Herzegovina 
[Mostar]. This would happen if it is decided that the police 
force is 400 men strong. 
  However both the defense minister, who will meet Mr. 
Koschnick this afternoon, and Javier Solana would like to see EU 
participation in this contingent be as small as possible 
considering that there are already Spanish Blue Helmets in the 
area. 
  [Begin Solana recording] And then we shall try to see the 
old 
security forces, the former police force, reestablished -- try 
to restore them so that they learn to live together and that 
will be a first step towards real pacification. [end recording]
