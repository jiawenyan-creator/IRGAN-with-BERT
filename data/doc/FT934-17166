FT  02 OCT 93 / Offer near for BBC service
A MANAGEMENT buy-out team is about to make an offer for the Executive
Business Club, the specialist television subscription service in
receivership. It was the founding programme on BBC Select, which broadcasts
subscription programmes to specially adapted video recorders in night hours.
Lancashire Enterprises, the Preston-based venture-capital group, is believed
to be interested in backing the company.
The club broadcasts management training programmes covering everything from
sales to the importance of cash flow.
In June Management TV International, the company behind Executive Business
Club, ran into cash problems of its own, coinciding with a decision by the
BBC not to expand BBC Select.
According to receivers Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the company has an estimated total
deficit of more than Pounds 2.5m, although this does not include
intellectual property rights in films which were written off when made.
Coopers has called a meeting of unsecured creditors at its Manchester office
on October 14.
Management TV International has Pounds 300,000 share capital, Pounds 200,000
of which was provided by the BBC.
