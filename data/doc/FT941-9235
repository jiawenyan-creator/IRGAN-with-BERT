FT  16 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Gatt target date eludes top traders
The world's four biggest traders - the US, the European Union, Japan and
Canada - plan to submit their final tariff schedules to Gatt within the next
few days, effectively concluding their market access negotiations under the
Uruguay Round of global trade talks.
The formal deadline for submission of schedules was yesterday. However,
trade officials said a few days' delay would not affect the timetable for
checking and printing schedules before the Uruguay Round package of trade
accords is signed in Marrakesh in April.
Hopes that Japan would agree to zero tariffs on wood and white spirits were
dashed during last week's meeting in Washington between President Bill
Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister. The US, EU and
Canada have withdrawn their offers to scrap tariffs on these items.
Tokyo has agreed to cut wood tariffs, now as high as 20 per cent, to about 6
per cent and copper tariffs will be halved to around 3 per cent.
