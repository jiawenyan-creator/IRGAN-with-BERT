FT  23 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lola accelerates growth away from the race
track
Lola, the British racing car maker, has signed its first aerospace
engineering contracts and is embarking on an expansion programme designed to
transform it into a public company within the next four years.
Mr Eric Broadley, chairman and founder of the Huntingdon,
Cambridgeshire-based company whose single seaters have dominated North
America's most prestigious IndyCar championship for much of the past decade,
has developed a strategy to triple the company's Pounds 12m a year turnover
and take it into mainstream automotive engineering as well as aerospace.
The company employs 160 at its two operating divisions in Huntingdon, but
this number is expected to grow as the strategy develops.
Mr Broadley, who owns 75 per cent of Lola Cars, said expansion outside of
motor racing would be based on the skills in chassis engineering,
aerodynamics and composite plastics technology that Lola has built up over
three successful decades of participation in most senior categories of motor
racing except Formula One grand prix.
Lola has signed several aerospace engineering contracts, including the
developments of parts for British Aerospace and Westland, the helicopter
concern recently acquired by GKN, the engineering and industrial services
group.
Mr Broadley regards aerospace as particularly compatible with the racing car
industry, in which the UK is the acknowledged world leader.
Aerospace requires high technology, low-volume production in which fast
response times during development are important - and which are fundamental
to racing car concerns because of the very nature of competition.
Much of Lola's expansion effort is being directed towards the rapidly
growing and technology hungry Pacific Rim region. Implicit in that is the
expectation that Lola will be able to stay ahead, in technology terms, of
the Asia-Pacific 'tiger' countries like Korea.
