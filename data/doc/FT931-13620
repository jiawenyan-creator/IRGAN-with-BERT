FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Anglo-American lifts profits
ANGLO-AMERICAN, the world's largest gold producer, increased attributable
profits at its gold operations by 33 per cent to R202.7m (Dollars 66m) in
the December quarter from the preceding three months to September.
Gold production rose 2 per cent to 66,399kg, while average revenue for the
quarter was R34,040 per kg, a 3 per cent rise from the previous quarter.
Average unit costs were reduced by 1 per cent to R26,387 per kg.
Announcing the group's results, Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of the gold and
uranium division, said he was bullish about gold price prospects. He noted
that large sales of gold reserves by the Dutch central bank had failed
substantially to depress the price at the end of last year, adding: 'We
think that's a sign that the gold market is quite capable of absorbing quite
large tonnages of gold'.
He believed further sales of gold reserves would keep the price in a narrow
band until the end of the year, when he expected a 'considerable
improvement'. 'There should be a genuine long-term upward shift in the gold
price towards the end of the year as the world economy improves,' he said.
Mr Lionel Hewitt, the division's managing director, said Freegold's 25.8 per
cent increase in attributable profit, which rose to R75.5m, was driven by an
increase in gold production and higher revenue.
Vaal Reefs recorded a 7.7 per cent rise in attributable profit for the 1992
year, rising to R212.2m. Production and revenues were flat, but costs were
slightly down, yielding the profit increase.
At Western Deep Levels, attributable profit for the year to December fell by
20.1 per cent to R86.4m.
