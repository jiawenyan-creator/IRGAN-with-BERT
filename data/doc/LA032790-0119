ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 
MALATHION SPRAYING DATES ANNOUNCED 
The Mediterranean fruit fly spray zone that takes in nearly all of Garden 
Grove, half of Westminster and parts of seven other cities will get its fourth 
application of malathion Thursday. 
In Orange County's other spray zone -- an area covering eight square miles in 
Brea, La Habra and Fullerton -- a scheduled round of spraying was cancelled 
Monday night because of fog and mist. 
Each zone is scheduled for two more sprayings: 
* April 16 and April 30 for the Brea area. 
* April 19 and May 3 for the Garden Grove area. 
A new supply of sterile Medflies is on its way to help fight the infestation, 
and state officials now say they expect to end the aerial spraying by May 9 -- 
a month ahead of schedule. 
However, the accelerated schedule was announced last week before two Medflies 
were discovered in Diamond Bar and Riverside. 
Agriculture officials have not scheduled any sprayings in response to those 
discoveries, the first in weeks, but they have set more traps in the areas 
where the two Medflies were found. It is not clear how the discoveries will 
affect the eradication effort, officials said. 
Spraying Schedule 
State agriculture officials this week announced new aerial spraying dates for 
areas thought to be infested with the Mediterranean fruit fly. These are 
expected to be the last sprayings. Under an accelerated schedule aimed at 
ending the controversial eradication effort by May 9, the Southland spray areas 
will be hit every 14 days beginning in April. Here are the Orange County areas 
affected and the dates of spraying: 
1. Brea: (An eight-square-mile area that includes parts of Brea, La Habra and 
Fullerton): Monday, April 16 and April 30 
2. Garden Grove: (A 36 square-mile area that includes virtually all of Garden 
Grove, about half of Westminster and parts of Anaheim, Orange, Santa Ana, 
Huntington Beach, Cypress, Los Alamitos and Stanton): Thursday, April 19 and 
May 3
