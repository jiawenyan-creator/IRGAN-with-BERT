FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Euromoney
Euromoney Publications, the publisher and training and conference organiser,
yesterday announced it was to acquire a 67 per cent stake in Raven Fox, a
fellow publishing company which specialises in the business to business
international travel retail market.
Euromoney will make an initial payment of Pounds 3.8m followed by a deferred
payment of up to Pounds 1.5m, dependent upon Raven's profits in the year to
end-December 1994.
Euromoney will acquire the balance of the equity in 1996, for which a
further performance-related payment is payable dependent upon Raven's
profits in the 1995 year.
The total consideration will not exceed Pounds 8.14m, although the directors
of Euromoney estimate that it will probably fall in the region of Pounds 7m.
In the year to December 31 1993 Raven Fox made a pre-tax profit of Pounds
654,000. Net assets at that date amounted to Pounds 884,000.
Euromoney, whose ultimate holding company is Rothermere Investments, in May
this year raised some Pounds 20m via a placing to fund its aggressive
acquisition policy.
