FT  14 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Ford pursues Polish plan
Ford of the US appears to be proceeding with plans to build a factory in
Poland to make seat covers for its west European car assembly plants, writes
Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. The plant would be built at Plonsk, 50km
north of Warsaw; preliminary work has started on a 14.3 hectare site Ford
recently acquired in the town.
The purchase was arranged by Property Services International, a Warsaw-based
real estate company representing Healey and Baker of the UK and Cushman and
Wakefield of the US. The Dollars 50m (Pounds 28m) project could bring 1,000
jobs to Plonsk which has 24,000 inhabitants and a 25 per cent unemployment
rate.
Ford representatives yesterday refused to comment on their plans in Poland,
saying they were still at an 'exploratory' stage and there was 'no sort of
an agreement' in place on the project.
