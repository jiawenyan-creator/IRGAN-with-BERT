FT  02 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Arbitration sought in rail dispute
LEADERS of the TSSA union for white-collar rail workers decided yesterday to
seek arbitration in their dispute with British Rail about a 7 per cent pay
offer.
British Rail indicated that it was prepared to agree to attend talks at the
Railway Staff National Tribunal, the industry's final appeal board.
Aslef, the drivers' union, has also asked for arbitration over a similar
offer.
The RMT, the largest rail workers' union, is recommending members to vote
for industrial action without first seeking arbitration.
The RMT and TSSA will today attend talks at Acas, the conciliation service,
with management of London Underground in an attempt to resolve a dispute
over planned job losses.
