FT  07 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: What should the ratio be of top to
low wages?
Sir, It is one of the curiosities of current economic debate that basic
questions are no longer asked, for instance, how can we get a more sensible
distribution of the labour input needed by a modern economy? Why have
recessions?
Here is another current example - what spread of earnings is needed in a big
company, from cleaner to chief executive, to provide adequate incentives? Is
the ratio 1 to 30, 1 to 50, 1 to 100, or what? Does it have to keep moving
up towards 1 to infinity?
It is a question which the incestuous remuneration committees of large
companies never ask - incestuous, because the non-executive director of
company A is likely to be the chief executive of company B, so that anything
which pushes up top salaries will be to his advantage when his turn comes
round. All we have are highly selected comparisons usually with Americans,
never with Japanese, where the spread from bottom to top is much smaller.
Actually, high pay probably makes chief executives lazier - once they have
bought their yachts, they have to spend time on them.
If there is to be a cabinet sub-committee on this question, perhaps one
member of it might raise this simple basic question - what should the ratio
be?
