  [Text] Lome, 13 Feb (AFP)--On 13 February, the Rally of the 
Togolese People [RPT], which supports President Eyadema, said 
the common front formed by the opposition for the second round 
of parliamentary elections on 20 February was a "facade 
coalition." 
  In a communique sent to AFP in Lome, RPT stated that the 
front "will only last about as long as other opposition accords, 
and at the first chance it will break up and give way to 
disorder." 
  According to the former sole party, "the people's main 
concern is to give the head of state a comfortable parliamentary 
majority in order to avoid a return to the wave of 
sociopolitical disturbances and unending strikes." 
  The Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] and the Togolese 
Union 
for Democracy [UTD], which will be representing the opposition 
in the second round, formed a common front on 11 February for 
the 20 February elections. 
  On 11 February, all the moderate opposition parties, 
including the six parties which did not make it in the first 
round, called for "general mobilization" against President 
Eyadema's supporters. They also called on the people to vote 
for UTD and CAR candidates. 
  The presidential group candidates obtained 35 seats in the 
first round of elections on 6 February. The opposition obtained 
22 seats in the first round but will obtain 12 other seats on 20 
February since CAR and UTD candidates will be contesting the run 
off.
