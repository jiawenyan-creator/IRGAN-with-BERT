BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE 
Campaign Funds: The U.S. senators caught in the web of controversy over their 
aiding Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan would help the former operators of the 
Irvine-based S&amp;L if they would return more than $175,000 in campaign funds, 
some observers say. 
As one lawyer put it, the money would go back to its donors -- Charles H. 
Keating Jr., his family and associates, many of whom could use the pocket 
change to help defend themselves against a civil bank fraud lawsuit that 
regulators filed against them after Lincoln collapsed. 
The senators argue that they did nothing wrong, and three of them -- Alan 
Cranston (D-Calif.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio) -- have so 
far refused to return campaign funds contributed by the Keating group. 
The others -- Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) -- 
have returned a total of more than $125,000. 
Keating is chairman of American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, which was the 
owner of Lincoln. American Continental filed for bankruptcy April 13, and 
regulators seized Lincoln the next day.
