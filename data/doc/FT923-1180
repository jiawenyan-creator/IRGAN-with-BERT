FT  24 SEP 92 / Letter: Training delay bad for unemployed
Sir, The government wants employment training to be more tightly restricted
to people who have been unemployed for more than six months ('Training
obligation for jobless ruled out', September 23). But common sense, research
evidence and good 'outplacement' practice indicates that help, guidance and
re-training are most needed and most effective immediately after or even
before the impact of unemployment. The damage to individuals and the economy
of this delay must outweigh any saving of public expenditure.
It is like the ambulance service restricting service to those accident
victims who have not walked away or found other help for more than six
hours. Now, there's a thought for the Treasury]
