FT  20 NOV 93 / Waste groups slam Tupe 'confusion'
WASTE DISPOSAL contractors will assume they must take on existing workforces
on unchanged pay and conditions when bidding for local authority contracts,
following new trade association guidance.
The decision by the National Association of Waste Disposal Contractors
conflicts with government advice that there is no need to assume that the
controversial Transfer of Undertakings (Public Employees) Regulations of
1981, known as Tupe, apply to competitive tendering.
Mr Steve Webb, policy director for the association, said the decision was
necessary because 'some authorities were using the confusion to suit
themselves and they would apply Tupe when they wanted to and not when they
didn't'.
He said the government had added to the confusion by failing to make a firm
statement on the issue. 'The only thing we seemed able to do was to adopt a
policy that we would assume that Tupe does apply. That at least puts some
levels of certainty into the situation.'
Mr Webb said the association was confident its members would continue to win
local authority contracts even if they did not make swift savings through
redundancies or pay reductions.
The environment department said the association was free to tender on this
basis if it wished, but 'the legal position remains that private contractors
cannot determine just like that whether Tupe applies'.
The Association of Metropolitan Authorities welcomed the association's
decision as 'a belated recognition that Tupe at least exists'.
However, Ms Lesley Courcouf, the AMA's Tupe specialist, said it should be
left to local authorities to say whether Tupe applied.
