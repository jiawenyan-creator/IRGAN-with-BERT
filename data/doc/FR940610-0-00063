Valuation of charitable remainder unitrusts having certain payout sequences for transfers for which the valuation
date is after November 30, 1983, and before May 1, 1989

_(1) 

In general. 

Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, in the case of transfers made after November 30,
1983, for which the valuation date is before May 1, 1989, the present value of a remainder interest that is dependent
on a term of years or the termination of the life of one individual is determined under paragraphs (d)(3) through (d)(6)
of this section, provided that the amount of the payout as of any payout date during any taxable year of the trust is not
larger than the amount that the trust could distribute on such date under 1.6643(a)(1)(v) if the taxable
year of the trust were to end on such date. The present value of the remainder interest in the trust is determined by computing
the adjusted payout rate (as defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section) and following the procedure outlined in
paragraph (d)(4) or (d)(5) of this section, whichever is applicable. The present value of a remainder interest that
is dependent on a term of years is computed under paragraph (d)(4) of this section. The present value of a remainder
interest that is dependent on the termination of the life of one individual is computed under paragraph (d)(5) of this
section. See paragraph (d)(2) of this section for testamentary transfers for which the valuation date is after November
30, 1983, and before August 9, 1984.

changed, and the decedent died after November 30, 1983, without regaining competency to dispose of the decedent's
property, or died within 90 days of the date on which the decedent first regained competency, the present value determined
under this section of a remainder interest is determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) and paragraphs (d)(3)
through (d)(6) of this section, or 1.6644A(c), at the option of the taxpayer.
