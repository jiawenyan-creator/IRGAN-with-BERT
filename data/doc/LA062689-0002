A TIME OF DANGER; 
BLIND SPOT IS A MENACE FOR SURFACING SUBMARINES 
Carefully, deliberately and by the book, the crewmen maneuvered the U.S. Navy 
submarine up from the depths of the Mediterranean Sea. They listened to the 
sonar for telltale noises. Nothing. The order was given to climb. 
As the periscope poked above the surface, the looming image of a 100,000-ton 
tanker came into focus, dead ahead. 
"He was so big that even head-on, bow-on . . . we couldn't hear his screws 
(propellers) through his hull, so we didn't know he was there," recalled 
retired Vice Admiral Patrick J. Hannifin. "We came up and went down in a 
hurry." 
Hannifin's submarine escaped harm's way during the near-collision, which 
occurred more than a decade ago in the Mediterranean Sea. Two weeks ago, off 
the coast of Los Angeles, the crew of the submarine Houston was not so 
fortunate. The crew of the tugboat Barcona was less fortunate still. 
The nuclear-powered Houston, on standby for filming of the motion picture "The 
Hunt for Red October," a fictional saga of a Soviet submarine skipper's 
defection to the United States, snagged the Barcona's steel tow cable and 
yanked the tugboat backward and under in less than a minute. One crew member 
drowned and two others survived. 
A Navy spokeswoman at the Houston's home port in San Diego called the incident 
"freakish," but the submarine only two days later, operating in roughly the 
same waters, sliced through a trawler's fishing net. The Navy says both 
incidents are under investigation. 
Navy officials have left many questions unanswered in the two recent accidents 
off the Southern California coast involving the Houston, a fast-attack 
submarine. But evidence has emerged that at least one of the incidents occurred 
while the Houston was in a blind spot similar to the one described by submarine 
experts interviewed last week. 
Strange as it may seem to civilians, submarine experts say that highly 
sophisticated Navy submarines sometimes travel through the oceans of the world 
nearly blind to what is around them. In fact, during some maneuvers the 
submarine captain operates with a blind spot not unlike a driver changing lanes 
on a freeway. 
Under Navy policy, submarines rarely use the sensitive "active" sonar systems 
on board because in order to do so they must emit signals that could reveal 
their location. Instead, they rely on "passive sonar," which means carefully 
listening for the sound of engines, clanking chains or any other auditory 
clues. 
No Noise, No Detection 
But if a vessel is not making any noise, there is little chance that the 
submariners will detect it. 
"It's quite extraordinary," said Angus Peetz, a research aide to George 
Foulkes, a member of the British Parliament who has pressed for a full-scale 
investigation of similar sub incidents off the British Isles. "They can hit 
targets 2,000 miles away, but they can't spot a fishing boat above them." 
While the issue of sub collisions is something relatively new to California 
mariners, it has been a growing controversy in Britain and Ireland. Members of 
both the British and Irish parliaments are demanding to know what role 
submarines may have played in the "mysterious" disappearances, sinkings and 
snaggings of several dozen fishing boats in the Irish Sea, resulting in the 
loss of more than 100 lives since 1980. 
Officials with the U.S. and British navies have said that their submarines have 
not been involved in fatal incidents in the area. However, officials in both 
navies have confirmed details of collisions and several snaggings involving 
submarines and civilian vessels. 
The collisions, naval experts say, illustrate a point that remains true today: 
Surfacing from the deep is a maneuver that challenges even the most experienced 
skippers with the highest-tech gadgets on board. 
Most Vulnerable Time 
"It's that time when the submarine is most vulnerable," said Hannifin, who was 
commander of all U.S. and NATO submarines in the Mediterranean from 1971 to 
1973, then went on to become the director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "He's 
really blind. The problem is that a submarine completely submerged can't see 
anything. 
"It can hear, but it can't see. It can hear a fishing boat, for example, if the 
fishing boat is running its engines. What it can't hear are fishing nets or 
barges being towed, because barges don't make any noise." 
In order to minimize the chances of running into another vessel, submarines 
generally travel well below the surface. When it is time to ascend, they move 
swiftly to periscope depth. 
"There is a period, truly, of uncertainty as you go through this transition 
from the deep submerged state to a shallow submerged state, and so you very 
carefully search around," said Capt. Thomas C. Maloney, retired commanding 
officer of a nuclear-powered submarine of the same class as the Houston. 
"You maneuver the ship to see if there's some target behind you," Maloney said, 
"and then you very quickly try to bring the ship up so you can look out through 
the periscope." 
Maloney described the transition period as a tension-filled time and compared 
it to an automobile on a freeway. "Once in a while, you get ready to change 
lanes and all of a sudden you find there's somebody in your blind spot," 
Maloney said, "even though you thought you've done a pretty careful search." 
Masked Sounds 
Such events occur rarely, Maloney said, and explanations vary. Sometimes 
another loud ship in the distance masks the sound of the closer ship, he said. 
Or sometimes it's simply a sailboat that was making no detectable noise. 
Still, active sonar, which is capable of detecting silent objects, is rarely 
used. Using passive sonar, a submarine crew member simply listens for noises, 
but with active sonar, the operator can send out sound waves that will bounce 
back to the submarine with a "ping" if it strikes an object. 
The active system works best in detecting totally submerged objects, Maloney 
said, but is less reliable when aimed at the surface. Depth, water conditions, 
surface waves and other variables all can generate sonar "clutter" that cuts 
down on reliability, he said. 
The overriding reason that active sonar is rarely used, however, is security. 
"When you use active sonar, you give your position away," said James Bush, a 
retired Navy captain and former submarine commander who now works with the 
Washington-based Center for Defense Information. 
Active sonar is generally reserved for "battle situations," Bush said. "You're 
going to shoot a torpedo at him anyway, so why not make sure you know exactly 
where he is." 
In any case, Bush and others said, it is highly unlikely that any sonar system 
would detect a fishing net. Navy officials confirm that fishermen from around 
the world have been reimbursed for nets and catches lost when submarines 
accidentally sliced through them, but precise figures were not made available 
last week. 
Bernard Moffat, general secretary of the Celtic League, an organization that 
fosters cooperation among the Celtic areas of the British Isles, has been 
monitoring military activity in the narrow, relatively shallow and heavily 
fished strip of sea between Ireland and mainland Britain known to submarine 
crew members as "Rat's Run." 
100 Civilian Deaths 
Since 1980, he said, there have been 21 disappearances of civilian vessels and 
more than 100 civilian deaths. The incidents have occurred in calm-to-moderate 
sea conditions, and Moffat claims that at least some of them probably are 
linked to submarines. 
In 1982, the British Navy paid damages after the submarine HMS Porpoise sank a 
fishing boat. All crew members were rescued. 
But U.S. submarine involvement in other accidents is less certain. Moffat 
acknowledges that "we can't say they're definitely linked to submarines," but 
he insists that "in almost all cases, the incidents occurred in what are listed 
on admiralty charts as designated submarine exercise areas." 
U.S. Navy officials confirm only a handful of close encounters in the Irish 
Sea. 
In April, a British trawler named Laurel was apparently snagged by an American 
sub off the Isle of Man. The U.S. Navy released a report saying only that the 
crew had no indication of the snagging, but minor paint scrapes found on the 
sub "were assumed to be the result of the snagging." An investigation is 
continuing, the Navy said. 
Three months earlier, U.S. officials say, a surface collision occurred between 
a U.S. submarine and the fishing vessel New Dawn. Authorities are awaiting a 
resolution with the insurance company representing the boat owner. 
Net-snagging incidents in 1987 prompted the U.S. Navy to pay out more than 
28,000 British pounds in damages to the owners of the British fishing vessels 
Heroine and Summer Morn.
