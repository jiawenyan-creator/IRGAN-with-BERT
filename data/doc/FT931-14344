FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Carlsberg-Tetley starts trading
CARLSBERG-TETLEY, the Pounds 510m joint venture formed by the merger of the
UK brewing, distribution and wholesaling operations of Allied-Lyons and
Carlsberg, began trading yesterday.
The merger, given the government go-ahead less than two months ago after a
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry, creates a third force in the UK
brewing industry.
Carlsberg-Tetley, with an output of 6.2m barrels of beer a year from its six
breweries, will have an 18 per cent share of production, rivalling Bass with
23 per cent and Courage with 20 per cent.
The company, with an annual turnover of Pounds 1.1bn and profits of about
Pounds 100m, has a strong portfolio of brands, including Carlsberg Pilsner,
Skol and Castlemaine lagers, each with sales of 1m barrels, and Tetley, the
UK's best-selling ale.
Mr Don Marshall, Carlsberg-Tetley's managing director, said yesterday that
the partnership would also benefit from the combination of distribution
systems. Allied's strength in direct sales to the pub trade in the Midlands
and northern England was complemented by Carlsberg's focus on wholesalers
and other brewers, particularly in London and southern England.
The company is closing seven of its 32 depots with a loss of up to 100 jobs.
No brewery closures are planned. Allied has recently closed its Romford
plant and its smallest brewery at Alloa, which was considered in danger of
closure, will now brew Carlsberg for outlets in Scotland.
