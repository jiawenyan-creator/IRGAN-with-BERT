FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Bokaemper to head Forte hotels
Forte has appointed Mr Stefan Bokaemper, a senior executive with
Inter-Continental Hotels, to head its luxury hotels division.
The appointment of Mr Bokaemper follows Forte's failure earlier this year to
persuade Mr Willi Bauer, former general manager of the Savoy Hotel, to take
the job. Mr Bauer said the post would have involved too much travelling.
Mr Bokaemper is currently Inter-Continental's executive vice-president in
the Asia-Pacific region. He has been with the company for 26 years and will
become managing director of Forte's exclusive hotels division. This is made
up of 16 hotels, including the Hyde Park Hotel in London, the George V in
Paris, the Ritz in Madrid and the Sandy Lane in Barbados.
Mr Rocco Forte, Forte's chairman, has said he would like to merge the
division with the Savoy group's hotels. Forte holds a majority of the
Savoy's shares but a minority of voting shares.
Forte is also in talks to take over the management of Ciga, the
Italian-based luxury hotels group.
