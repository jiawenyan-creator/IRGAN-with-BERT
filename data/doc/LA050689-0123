ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CYPRESS; 
POLICE CHASE, CAPTURE SUSPECT FLEEING IN CAR 
Police and sheriff's deputies chased a car thought to be stolen for several 
miles early Friday, then opened fire when the driver tried to run them down in 
a parking lot, authorities said. 
The suspect, a 23-year-old Los Angeles man whose name was not immediately 
released, was taken to Long Beach Memorial Hospital for treatment of injuries 
suffered when the car crashed and for a possible gunshot wound, Cypress Police 
Lt. John Schaefer said. 
The suspect faced possible assault charges for allegedly attempting to ram 
officers with the car, which turned out not to have been stolen, Schaefer said. 
A Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy tried to stop the driver about 2:30 a.m. 
near Atlantic and Alondra boulevards in an unincorporated area of the county 
near Compton because he believed the car was possibly stolen. The driver, who 
was alone in the car, fled with the deputy in pursuit. Compton police joined 
the chase, Schaefer said. 
The chase lasted more than 10 miles and ended in Cypress when the driver 
crashed in a parking lot in an industrial area. The driver then put the car 
into reverse and accelerated toward the deputy and Compton officers, who fired 
several shots. 
No officers were hurt.
