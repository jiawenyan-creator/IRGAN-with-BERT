  [Text] Sofia, January 10 (BTA) -- A final agreement 
between Bulgaria and the London Club may be expected by the end 
of July if both sides are efficient, Bulgarian Finance Minister 
Stoyan Aleksandrov said today before leaving for Frankfurt for 
the second two-day round of the negotiations between this 
country and the commercial creditor banks of the London Club. 
  The forthcoming round continues the one held last November, 
when the two parties reached an agreement in principle for some 
50 percent reduction of Bulgaria's nearly $12,000 million 
foreign debt to the private creditors of the London Club. Then 
the sides agreed to meet again on January 11 to finalize the 
agreement. 
  The Bulgarian delegation to the negotiations also includes 
Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank Chief Chavdar Kunchev and Agency 
for Economic Coordination and Development Chief Ventsislav 
Antonov. 
  The agreement in principle envisaged that Bulgaria initially 
pay 5 percent of the interest due for the second, third and 
fourth quarter of 1993. Before the agreement is concluded this 
country should pay $10 million interest rate monthly plus an 
$865 million initial payment. One million U.S. dollar loans 
expected from international financial institutions will help the 
debt settlement. 
  According to Foreign Debt Management Committee member 
Ventsislav Antonov, certain problems are likely to pop out in 
the negotiations. Unless curbed, the steep rise of the U.S. 
dollar may turn out to be a stumbling block. The U.S. currency 
went up by 10 points last week. Other problems may arise if the 
cabinet allows an aggravation of the macroeconomic parameters or 
if the 1994 national budget does not comply with the 
IMF-approved frame work and the stand-by arrangement fails. 
  Bulgaria suspended payments on its foreign debt in March 
1990.
