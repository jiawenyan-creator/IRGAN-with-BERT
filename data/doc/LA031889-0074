STATISTICALLY SPEAKING, BOGGS IS BETTER OFF SINGLE 
If Wade Boggs, who has the fourth-highest batting average in major league 
baseball history at .354, hit .221 when his wife was with him and .341 when 
Margo Adams was around, he'd better stay away from both of them. 
They're killing his lifetime batting average.
