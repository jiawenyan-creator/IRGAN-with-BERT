FT  18 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Upgrade lifts Warburg
A LARGE upgrading in its profits forecast by French-owned stockbroker Credit
Lyonnais Laing (CLL) was the trigger for another outstanding performance by
SG Warburg, regarded as one of the UK's leading merchant banks and
integrated securities houses. Warburg is heavily involved in the forthcoming
ICI rights issue and is global co-ordinator of the third issue of BT shares.
At the close of business SG Warburg shares were 28 ahead at a record closing
high of 701p. Earlier, the stock had touched an all-time intraday peak of
704p. Turnover amounted to 301,000 shares.
Mr Neil Baker, merchant banks analyst at CLL, said he had lifted his
estimate of pre-tax profits for the year to the end of March 1993 from
Pounds 131.2m to Pounds 154.2m - the top of the market range - and his
estimate for the year to end-March 1994 from Pounds 182m to Pounds 267m.
Most analysts' estimates for the 1993-94 year are said to be below Pounds
200m.
Mr Baker said the key to the upgrading of his forecasts for the bank was an
expected upturn in the performance of Warburg's investment banking
operation. 'The shares are cheap on a prospective price/ earnings multiple
of nine times against a market p/e of 14 times,' added Mr Baker.
Another booster for Warburg shares came from the stock's probable elevation
to the FT-SE 100 Index, possibly after the next scheduled meeting of the
FT-SE steering committee on June 9.
