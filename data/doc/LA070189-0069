MARCOS STILL SEMI-COMATOSE AFTER OPERATION 
Former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos remained semi-comatose and on a 
dialysis machine Friday after removal of a malfunctioning transplanted kidney, 
a hospital official said. 
"The condition has not worsened since yesterday (Thursday). He remains 
semi-comatose, but is responding to pain, but not command," Eugene Tiwanak, St. 
Francis Medical Center assistant administrator, said. 
Doctors Thursday removed the kidney -- which Marcos received in a transplant in 
1984 -- because his body had begun rejecting the organ. They hoped the 
operation would clear the massive infection that has gripped the ailing, exiled 
leader. 
Marcos' temperature was down to about 100 degrees, which Tiwanak called a 
favorable sign. It had been as high as 104 degrees before the operation. 
Marcos, 71, will have to undergo dialysis daily, said Tiwanak. Marcos remains 
on a respirator in the hospital's intensive care unit.
