  [Text] The Commonwealth special envoys to Lesotho told 
journalists that the warring factions of the Lesotho armed 
forces have agreed to lay down their arms. They said they have 
agreed with the two factions that they should return their 
weapons to their respective barracks. The public is notified 
that as from now there will be a movement of military vehicles 
in the streets of Maseru. The Commonwealth delegation is, 
however, continuing its task of reconciling the two warring 
factions of the army.
