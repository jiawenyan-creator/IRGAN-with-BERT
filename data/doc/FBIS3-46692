  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 3 KYODO -- The government has begun to 
study the possibility of implementing income and residential tax 
cuts worth 7 trillion yen as part of new pump-priming measures, 
the MAINICHI SHIMBUN reported Monday. 
  This is in response to a protracted recession and rising 
calls for greater income tax cuts from ruling coalition and 
opposition parties, the mass-circulation daily said. 
  The government also intends to carry out the tax reductions 
two years ahead of a hike in the 3 percent consumption tax, it 
said, quoting government sources. 
  The sources were also quoted as saying the government is 
taking account of talks between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton scheduled for February 
11 in Washington. 
  At the talks, the United States is expected to urge Japan to 
whittle down its huge trade surplus by boosting domestic demand, 
the daily said. 
  The government is coordinating views within the ruling 
parties to implement more than 6 trillion yen worth of income 
and residential tax cuts while the finance ministry has 
expressed its intention of raising the consumption tax from 3 
percent to 7 percent from April 1995. 
  The opposition Liberal Democratic Party, however, is seeking 
10 trillion yen worth of such tax reductions. 
  Moreover, some members of Shinseito [Japan Reneewal Party], 
the second-largest of the ruling coalition parties, are also 
calling for 10 trillion yen worth of tax cuts while the Social 
Democratic Party, the largest of coalition parties, is opposed 
to the consumption tax hike.
