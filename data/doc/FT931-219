FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Opposition ready to attack on tax
LABOUR has begun amassing its ammunition to attack the government over the
changes to direct taxation in the Budget.
It will force ministers to spell out the consequences for different income
groups of the measures announced a fortnight ago.
Some opposition spokesmen are conscious that the row over the decision to
levy Value Added Tax on domestic fuel from next April has distracted
attention from the significant changes to taxes on people's income.
Attention was particularly drawn to the freezing of tax allowances, the one
per cent increase in National Insurance contributions, and cutting to 20 per
cent the rate at which mortgage interest relief can be claimed.
Labour spokesmen are determined to use the detailed discussion on the
finance bill in the Commons to turn the spotlight on how those changes
measure up to the government's pledges on direct taxation. Some of their
colleagues, however, do not believe that the issue will become high-profile
until the NI rises actually take effect in April next year.
The bill is expected to be debated in the Commons at the end of this month,
and there will then be a few days of detailed discussion in which all MPs
can take part before the bill goes for consideration in a committee.
But the introduction of the 20 per cent tax rate and its expansion in this
year's March Budget has meant that altogether, the combined tax and national
insurance liability of the lower half of taxpayers is less under the
proposed regime for 1993-94 than it would have been had the tax regime in
1987-88 been continued.
Answering questions from Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow social security
secretary, Mr Stephen Dorrell, the Treasury financial secretary, said
yesterday that the tax and NI liability for the bottom 20 per cent of
taxpayers was Pounds 1.7bn, compared with indexation of the 1987-88 regime
which would have been Pounds 2.3bn.
