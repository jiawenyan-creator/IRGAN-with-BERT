FT  24 JAN 92 / World Trade News: LA angers Sumitomo
SUMITOMO of America, a US subsidiary of the Japanese company, has accused
the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission of cancelling a Dollars
122m (Pounds 67.4m) contract to buy railway carriages 'for
non-business-related reasons'.
This comes as the latest demonstration of Americans' growing resentment over
the US trade imbalance with Japan.
The contract was for the Green Line, a 23-mile, 14-station line, scheduled
to go into operation in 1995, is part of a 30-year, Dollars 150bn mass
transport system for Los Angeles County.
Under mounting public pressure to keep jobs and funding in the US, the
county transportation commission reversed its December decision to place the
contract with Sumitomo, which supplied rail cars for the first stage of the
system.
Despite an eleventh-hour plan by Sumitomo to make General Electric of the US
a 'substantial participant' in its bid for the project, the transport
commission voted unanimously to withdraw the contract.
Mr Kenji Miyahara, president of Sumitomo of America, said the termination
indicated Japan-bashing.
