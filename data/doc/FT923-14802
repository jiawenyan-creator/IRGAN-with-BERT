FT  06 JUL 92 / International Company News: Germany eases CP issuance
THE Bundesbank is liberalising further the German capital markets by making
it easier for foreign companies to issue commercial paper.
From August 1, foreign companies will be able to make D-Mark commercial
paper issues without having to set up a special German offshoot. Also,
German branches of foreign banks will be able to lead manage issues in
D-Marks.
The Bundesbank said its moves took account of the single European market and
recent developments in international capital markets. The commercial paper
market in Germany has grown rapidly since restrictions were removed last
year.
But the central bank said it still held to its 'anchor principle' under
which the market for D-Mark issues is based in Germany. It intended to
safeguard its minimum reserve requirements in the interests of monetary
policy.
These requirements mean banks have to hold a proportion of their deposits at
the Bundesbank, free of interest. Minimum reserves are obligatory for issues
by banks, domestic and foreign, with a maturity of under two years.
Previously, the Bundesbank said, the two-year minimum maturity rule had not
differentiated between banks and non-banks. Foreign companies will now be
able to issue D-Mark bonds with shorter maturities.
The Bundesbank repeated its opposition to money market funds, which it
believes would subvert its monetary policy.
