  [Excerpt] Sao Paulo -- Of the five presidents invited for 
the inauguration of the Tiete and Parana Rivers interconnection, 
only Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and Paraguayan 
President Juan Carlos Wasmosy arrived at this city this morning 
to travel to the work area. The Brazilian press expressed 
surprise at Wasmosy's presence during this time of social 
agitation in our country. Presidents Carlos Menem of Argentine, 
Luis Alberto Lacalle of Uruguay, and Itamar Franco himself 
considered the inauguration of minor importance and excused 
themselves from attending with the Sao Paulo governor, giving 
scheduling as their reason. The presidents of Paraguay and 
Bolivia are the only presidents who will be present at this 
afternoon's ceremony. [passage omitted]
