  [Text] In a goodwill message to the nation, the head of 
state, General Sani Abacha, said the lessons of the festival [Id 
el Kebir] which are selflessness, readiness to share, care for 
the less fortunate in the society, and sacrifice, should serve 
as guide for all Nigerians. He said the nation needs, now more 
than ever before, Nigerians who are willing to offer sacrifice 
to ensure the survival of the nation and the revival of the 
economy. 
  Referring of the delegates election coming up on Monday [23 
May], Gen. Abacha appealed for understanding and cooperation of 
all patriots, to enable his administration lay a solid 
foundation for democracy in the country. He specifically called 
on champions of democracy not to disrupt genuine and patriotic 
steps being taken to restore democratic rule in Nigeria. 
  To those who may be planning to cause trouble during the 
delegates election, the head of state said he hopes such persons 
are aware of the consequences of such actions. He assured 
law-abiding citizens of adequate protection as they file out on 
Monday to exercise their inalienable right. He said Nigeria is 
greater than any individual, and people should not allow those 
he described as disgruntled and self-seeking individuals to 
plunge the country into chaos and anarchy.
