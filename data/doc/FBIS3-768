<F P=106> [Statement issued by the office of the chief minister of </F>
kwaZulu, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, on 13 March on the SAPA PR Wire 
Service] 
  [Text] The TEC [Transitional Executive Council] and the 
South African Government have illegally removed President Lucas 
Mangope from office in Bophuthatswana and this should send 
warning signals to all democrats as to the intentions of the ANC 
[African National Congress]/SACP [South African Communist 
Party]/SA [South African] Government/NP [National Party] 
alliance. It appears that opposition to the fatally flawed 1993 
constitution, as amended, will be smashed by whatever means, 
including orchestrated mob violence and anarchy under the guise 
of popular uprising. 
  President Mangope has been overthrown not by violent, 
looting, demonstrators under the control of the ANC/SACP but by 
the South African Government, in league with the ANC/SACP, in 
terms of powers which they have given themselves. 
  It is significant that at no stage during this week's 
turmoil 
did the ANC/SACP/SA Government deplore the criminal activities 
of those engaged in public murder and mayhem. This deliberate 
plan to oust an elected leader was plain for all to see and now, 
staggeringly, it is being applauded by some here and abroad as a 
triumph for democracy! The facts are that this action has 
placed South Africa on a slippery slope to chaos. 
  By removing President Mangope in this manner, democracy has 
already been dispensed with in South Africa and I fear for our 
future. The right to disagree with the ANC/SACP/SA 
Government/NP alliance is being ruthlessly snuffed out. The 
right to intellectually oppose and to resolve differences 
democratically, stifled by the manipulators of baying mob 
violence and the tactics of terror and intimidation. When will 
administrative decree become the order of the day throughout 
South Africa, as it is now in Bophuthatswana? 
  There appear to be indications that the same strategies are 
being devised for action in kwaZulu/Natal. All I can say is 
that kwaZulu/Natal is not Bophuthatswana. We are intent on 
seeking democratic ways and means of reaching constitutional 
agreements, in the best interests of our citizens and to the 
satisfaction of his majesty the king of the Zulu nation, based 
on consensus and compromise and a peaceful way forward. 
  Recent events in Bophuthatswana shame South Africa and 
reveal 
the clenched fist of the ANC/SACP/SA Government/NP alliance 
acting in tandem. For this they are now praised by their 
supporters here and abroad, but for how long? By their actions 
they have placed the people of our country in grave danger with 
their contempt of our laws and international standards of 
conflict resolution. I appeal to the international community to 
use all the resources at its disposal to warn the ANC/SACP/SA 
Government of the consequences of their action.
