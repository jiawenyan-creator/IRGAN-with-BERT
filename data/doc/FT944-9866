FT  14 NOV 94 / Gyngell in talks on taking the helm at Yorkshire TV
Mr Ward Thomas, chairman of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television, will have
informal talks this week with Mr Bruce Gyngell, former TV-am chairman, about
the possibility of Mr Gyngell taking over at Yorkshire.
The present Yorkshire chairman is not, however, planning to retire until
spring 1996 so the aim is to have a successor in place rather than go for an
early handover.
Since 1992, when he lost the breakfast television franchise to GMTV, Mr
Gyngell has been running Channel Nine in Australia. He is believed to be
interested in a return to UK television.
Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, was for a time a possible
successor to Mr Thomas. Talks were initiated by Mr Grade and it is believed
that a proposition involving the allocation of shares to Mr Grade was put to
Yorkshire. The deal was that the Channel 4 chief executive would become
chairman and chief executive of Yorkshire in return for 5 per cent of the
equity.
The retirement plans of Mr Thomas roughly coincided with the end of Mr
Grade's existing contract at Channnel 4. But the deal, which would have
given Mr Grade a stake worth about Pounds 10m, was vetoed by the
representatives of Yorkshire's two large minority shareholders - Mr Frank
Barlow, managing director of Pearson (owner of the Financial Times), and Mr
Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada.
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, which has to pay about Pounds 1m a month to the
government following the tenders for new ITV licences and had financial
troubles caused by overtrading in advertising sales, will announce this week
that it is back in profit.
Some City analysts such as Hoare Govett had been predicting a loss of Pounds
1.5m.
It is believed the company made a Pounds 5m profit in the second half which
will contribute to a modest profit for the year as a whole.
