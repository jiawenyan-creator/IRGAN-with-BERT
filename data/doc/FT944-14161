FT  25 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Pakistan's PM reaches out to Turkmenistan
Pakistan tomorrow launches an effort to expand its trade with the former
Soviet republics in central Asia with the arrival of Ms Benazir Bhutto, the
prime minister, in Ashkabad, the capital of Turkmenistan.
The three-day visit, Ms Bhutto's first to the region, precedes plans to take
a first convoy of trucks with Pakistani goods through Afghanistan to
Turkmenistan, later this month.
Pakistan has been trying to expand trade with the newly independent region
for almost three years. But continued fighting in Afghanistan has disrupted
previous efforts. However, a visit last month to parts of Afghanistan by
interior minister Naseerullah Khan Babar has enabled Islamabad to arrange
deals with local warlords, who have given assurances of safe passage in
return for still undecided local taxes, senior officials said.
Under the plan, the trucks will leave the border post at Chaman, in the
Pakistani province of Baluchistan, before entering Afghanistan and then
Turkmenistan via the western Afghan city of Herat. 'Vested interests can
help to turn the situation to our favour. When some Afghans realise that
there's money in this affair, they'll co-operate,' said a senior government
official.
Pakistan hopes to export small consumer items such as soap, toothpaste,
garments and leather products, which are apparently in short supply in
ex-Soviet republics. In return, Islamabad wants to explore opportunities for
the import of gas and oil from Turkmenistan and neighbouring countries.
Mr Ahmed Mukhtar, Pakistan's commerce minister, said that the prime
minister's visit would open the way for trade but that it was up to business
men to seek opportunities. More than 200 businessmen were expected to
accompany Ms Bhutto to participate in a Pakistani export exhibition.
From Turkmenistan's side, the government of Mr Saparmurad Nayazhov has
already expressed an interest in discussing the oil pipeline.
