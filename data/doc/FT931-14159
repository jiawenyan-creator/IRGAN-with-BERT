FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lottery campaign for charity status
A CAMPAIGN to make the government change its proposals for a national
lottery and to give the organisation charitable status won backing from Tory
MPs yesterday.
Sir Ivan Lawrence, Conservative chairman of the Commons home affairs
committee, was among Tories endorsing the National Lottery Campaign. The
campaigners argue that charitable status will make the national lottery
independent of government and ensure its exemption from taxation.
The heritage department argues that there would be no benefits from
charitable status.
The campaign was accompanied by signs of friction among Labour MPs, who were
keen to oppose the lottery proposals. About 110 Labour MPs have written to
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, calling on the opposition party to oppose the
national lottery bill when it is debated in the Commons on Monday.
