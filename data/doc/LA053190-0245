SHORT TAKES; 
AUSSIE ROCKERS ON N.Y. STREETS 
Australian rock band Midnight Oil took their music and environment theme to the 
streets, performing amid the skyscrapers of midtown Manhattan for a lunchtime 
crowd. 
"We've got a mega-crisis on our hands that we all have to approach," lead 
singer Peter Garrett said after Wednesday's performance. 
"We've got a crisis that our leaders, corporations and governments have a prime 
responsibility to address seriously." 
The band is on a U.S. tour to promote their new album, "Blue Sky Mining." 
Although they have been performing for 10 years, their U.S. breakthrough wasn't 
until 1987 with their hit song "Beds Are Burning" from their album "Diesel and 
Dust." 
Their songs concentrate on the ecosystem, world peace and corporate greed. At 
the invitation of Midnight Oil, the environmental group Greenpeace sets up 
information tables at each concert. 
Garrett is also an attorney and president of the Australian Conservation 
Foundation, the country's leading advisory board on problems of national 
heritage and environment. 
"We can't just do a one-day Earth Day," Garrett said.
