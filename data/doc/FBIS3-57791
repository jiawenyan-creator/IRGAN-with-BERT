  [Text] Paris, Dec 30 (AFP) -- Two Iranians wanted by the 
Swiss authorities for the murder of an Iranian opposition leader 
have been expelled to Iran "for reasons of national interest", 
the prime minister's office said here late Thursday [30 
December]. 
  Mohsen Sharif Esfahani, 37, and Ahmad Taheri, 32, were 
expelled Wednesday, said the office of French Premier Edouard 
Balladur. 
  The pair were suspected of involvement in the April 1990 
murder near Geneva of Kazem Rajavi, brother of Mas'ud Rajavi, 
leader of the People's Mujahidin, an armed group opposed to the 
Iranian authorities.
