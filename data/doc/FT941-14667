FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Proteus link prompts 42p share price rise
Proteus International, the USM-traded computer-aided molecular modelling
group, has signed an agreement with American Home Products to design and
develop bio-logicals and pharmaceu-ticals as animal vaccines and
therapeutics for the global market.
The news prompted a 42p rise in Proteus shares to 472p.
The alliance with AHP, the world's fourth largest pharmaceutical company
ranked by total sales and the third largest in veterinary products, is
intended to be a multi-product joint venture that will con-centrate on a
wide range of potential animal health products - including lytic peptides as
enhancers of and substitutes for current antibiotics.
AHP has an animal health product range of some 200 products. It had total
sales of about Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.4bn) in 1992, of which Dollars 4.5bn
was in human and animal pharmaceuticals.
Under the terms of the agreement Proteus becomes the research arm of Fort
Dodge Laboratories, the centre of AHP's animal healthcare activities.
At present, the worldwide market for surgical neutering of dogs and cats
alone is over Dollars 700m a year. Proteus's immunocastration product, which
will be available through AHP, could 'greatly increase' the size of this
market.
