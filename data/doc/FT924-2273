FT  14 DEC 92 / Female condom set for US approval
FEMIDOM, the British-invented female condom, has been recommended for swift
approval by an advisory committee of the US Food and Drug Administration,
Paul Abrahams writes.
That would enable a rapid launch of the product in the world's largest
market.
The FDA obstetrics and gynaecology devices committee said the device, known
in the US as Reality, should prove significant in slowing the spread of the
HIV virus that causes Aids.
The committee had been concerned about the device's effectiveness but new
evidence showed the HIV virus was unable to permeate the condom's sheath.
The condom is also 88 per cent effective as a contraceptive, according to
Chartex International, the UK manufacturer.
The product is to be marketed in North America and Mexico by the US group
Wisconsin Pharmacal.
Femidom, a pliable polyurethane sheath which lines the vagina, was launched
in the UK in September. It is also marketed in Switzerland and Austria and
is due to be launched in the Netherlands next month.
