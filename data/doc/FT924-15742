FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Shake-up at IBM's Japanese unit
IBM Japan, the Japanese subsidiary of the US computer group, yesterday
announced a corporate restructuring to increase the operational autonomy of
its marketing divisions.
The company said Mr Takeo Shiina, president, would become chairman and chief
executive, while Mr Kakutaro Kitashira, vice-president, would become
president in January.
Under the restructuring, IBM Japan's general business division, which is in
charge of marketing to middle-sized companies and personal users, becomes a
wholly-owned subsidiary with a separate profit and loss account.
The services business division becomes a subsidiary. Expanding services to
customers has become an important focus of IBM's efforts to grow in the
Japanese market.
The Japanese parent will be responsible for large corporate customers, for
IBM's Asia Pacific technical operation, and for general staff functions.
The moves follow the restructuring of IBM's worldwide operations to
decentralise group functions into independent business divisions and
subsidiaries.
IBM named Mr James Bartlett, formerly of Philips Electronics, to manage the
mobile computing business at IBM Personal Computer, the company established
a month ago to develop new products and services, Reuter reports.
