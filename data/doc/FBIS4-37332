  [Text] Cairo, June 20 (AFP)--A UN special envoy on Monday 
[20 June] announced the end of his mediation effort here between 
the warring Yemeni sides after failing to broker a ceasefire in 
their civil war. 
  Former Algerian foreign minister Lakhdar Brahimi told AFP 
"there will be no meetings today with the Yemeni parties" after 
a fruitless day of discussions on Sunday. 
  Brahimi said he would meet Arab League secretary general 
'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid before leaving on Tuesday for New York, 
when he will report back to UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. 
  He had met separately with the northern and southern 
delegations on Sunday, but they refused to hold a joint session 
and there was no agreement on how to set up a ceasefire 
mechanism. 
  The southerners later announced that they were pulling out 
of 
the talks because Brahimi's meeting with their rivals had failed 
to produce results. 
  The southerners also charged that the northern team had no 
mandate to agree to a ceasefire. 
  Seventy-nine people had been killed and 248 wounded by late 
Sunday in a four-day barrage of the southern bastion of Aden by 
northern forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  Brahimi was sent on a fact-finding mission in line with a UN 
Security Council resolution adopted on June 1 calling for an 
immediate ceasefire. 
  The north has insisted that a joint military commission 
should be set up to oversee a truce in the war which broke out 
on May 5. 
  But the south has accused Sanaa of playing for time in the 
hope of continuing its assault on Aden, capital of a breakaway 
state declared by southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid on May 21.
