  [Text] Washington, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Japan urged the United 
States on Monday [28 February] to further rationalize the use of 
military facilities in Okinawa Prefecture, Japanese officials 
said. 
  Ichiro Yoneyama, head of the Defense Facilities 
Administration Agency, made the request in meetings with Winston 
Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific 
affairs, and Stanley Roth, deputy assistant secretary of defense 
for East Asia and the Pacific. 
  Yoneyama particularly raised the issue of port facilities in 
Naha where the U.S. military faces continuing pressure from 
local authorities to hand over the naval base in the provincial 
capital. 
  Both Lord and Roth expressed their understanding of the 
Okinawan people's feelings and pledged their efforts to resolve 
the base issue through cooperation with Japanese authorities, 
the Japanese officials said.
