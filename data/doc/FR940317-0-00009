 

The marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular fiscal year
apply to all assessable olives handled from the beginning of such year. Annual budgets of expenses are prepared by
the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of this marketing order, and submitted to the Department
for approval. The members of the Committee are handlers and producers of California olives. They are familiar with
the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and are thus in a position
to formulate appropriate budgets. The Committee's budget is formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus,
all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input.

The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of olives. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will provide sufficient
income to pay the Committee's expected expenses.

The California Olive Committee met on December 14, 1993, and unanimously recommended a total expense amount of $3,748,290,
for its 1994 budget. This is $928,530 more in expenses than the previous year. The increase is primarily due to additional
funding for market development.

The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $27.21 per ton for the 1994 fiscal year, which is
$1.46 more in the assessment rate from the 1993 fiscal year. The assessment rate, when applied to anticipated shipments
of 101,000 tons, would yield $2,748,210 in assessment income. This, along with approximately $1,000,000 from the
Committee's authorized reserves will be adequate to cover estimated expenses.

Major expense categories for the 1994 fiscal year include $1,150,000 for the market expansion program, $990,860
for consumer affairs, and $173,730 for salaries. Funds in the reserve at the end of the fiscal year, estimated at $300,000
will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses.

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly
offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS
has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the fiscal year for the Committee began January 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment
for the fiscal year apply to all assessable olives handled during the fiscal year; 

(3) handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting; and (4) this interim
final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization
of this action.
