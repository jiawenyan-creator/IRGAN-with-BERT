YUGOSLAV TEEN UPSETS 4TH-SEED KENT CARLSSON IN GERMAN OPEN 
Teen-ager Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia upset defending champion Kent Carlsson 
of Sweden 7-5, 4-6, 6-1 in the second round of the German Open men's tennis 
tournament today. 
Carlsson, seeded fourth, was the highest-ranked casualty on the red clay of 
Hamburg's Rothenbaum club in today's action. 
Ivanisevic, 16, was a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open and a semifinalist 
at the Nice tournament last month. 
Another seed was ousted when Jan Gunnarsson of Sweden defeated Andrei Chesnokov 
of the Soviet Union 6-4, 6-3. 
Chesnokov was seeded 13th after winning the Nice event and last week's Bavarian 
Open in Munich. 
Chesnokov said he was tired after a 10-hour train ride from Munich to Hamburg. 
He then opened another round in the growing dispute between some Soviet tennis 
players and their federation. 
Under Soviet Tennis Federation regulations, Soviet professionals are requested 
to turn over most of their hard-currency earnings to the federation. 
The first to rebel was Natalia Zvereva, the seventh-ranked woman player in the 
world, and she was later joined by Chesnokov. The two want to keep a larger 
portion of their prize money. 
Chesnokov told reporters that a first round of talks between Zvereva and Soviet 
tennis officials failed to produce an agreement, but he said he hopes for a 
compromise.
