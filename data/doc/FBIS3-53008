  [Editorial Report] Tripoli Libyan Television Network in 
Arabic at 1949 GMT on 7 January carries a 66-minute recorded 
speech by Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi "to the 
masses of Surman and Abu 'Isa" on 2 January. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi says that with this speech he is concluding his 
visits to various parts of the country. He says that the world 
has witnessed the reaction of the Libyan people and how they are 
rallying in defense of their country and rights. The Libyans 
have not attacked another country, nor interfered in other 
people's affairs. We live on our land and want peace with 
others. He again asks how the author of The Satanic 
Verses can be received by Western leaders. If we hold out 
the olive branch to them, they will not accept. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi then recalls how the Libyan people resisted 
Italy. The people refused to submit. He says the Libyan people 
will not surrender despite the weapons the West has. The West 
asks why the Libyans meet with Abu Nidal, Jibril, etc. We meet 
them because these people are strugglers fighting for their 
land. George Washington fought the British as Abu Nidal is 
doing. Regarding the IRA, al-Qadhdhafi says that Libya meets 
the IRA just as the British meet the IRA in secret. The West 
says Kurds in Iraq have rights but Kurds in Turkey don't -- this 
is because Turkey is with the West. Imperialist circles are 
against all those who refuse to surrender. They want to make 
profits at our expense. We will triumph because our enemy looks 
for profit. No matter what we do these people do not want our 
friendship.
