<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change
Relating to Adoption of New Rule 123A.46</DOCTITLE>


September 27, 1994.


On February 22, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a proposed rule change to adopt a new Rule 123A.46 pertaining to members' representation of multiple orders.

The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34343 (July 11, 1994), 59
FR 36243 (July 15, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.
Currently, the NYSE Rules do not place any limitations upon members who represent orders for more than one customer
at the same time and on the same side of the market. New Rule 123A.46 will require such members and member organizations
(including ``upstairs'' trading personnel) to inform customers if their orders may not receive an execution in time
priority of receipt, or may not receive an equal or proportional split.
For example, if a broker was representing three not held orders to buy stock, one for 100,000 shares, and two for 50,000
shares each, and the broker executed a trade for 12,000 shares, the broker will be permitted under Rule 123A.46 to (1)
allocate all 12,000 shares to the customer who entered the order first (time priority), (2) split the trade equally
by giving 4,000 shares to each customer, or (3) split the trade proportionally to the customer orders, 

i.e.,

 6,000 shares, 3,000 shares and 3,000 shares. Under these circumstances, the new rule will not require NYSE members
to make a disclosure to its customers. However, if the execution would be split in any other manner, the member will
be required by Rule 123A.46 to disclose this information to its customers prior to representing the multiple orders,
unless the terms of the order provides for a different split.
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission believes that new NYSE Rule 123A.46 will benefit investors by requiring that they are informed of the
manner in which their orders will be executed should a member represent multiple orders on the same side of the market.
The rule specifies that in this situation, members may execute the customer orders in time priority of receipt, or
split the execution equally among the orders or proportionally based upon the size of the orders. If members who represent
multiple orders on the same side of the market allocate executions in any other manner, they must first inform their
customers. Customers would then have the ability to withdraw their orders if they so desire.
The Commission believes that requiring members to notify customers if their orders may be executed other than in the
specified manners allows investors to better monitor the representation of their orders and helps to ensure that
their orders are being handled fairly and equitably. By requiring such executions or notification to customers,
investors are assured that their orders will not be executed in a manner which they believe may be disadvantageous
to their interests.

In this regard, the Commission recently approved a proposal by the NYSE that placed limits on intra-day trading by
floor brokers. The Commission stated in its approval of these intra-day trading limitations that it is not inconsistent
with the Act for a self-regulatory organization to limit certain types of trading activity in order to minimize interference
with the execution of public customer orders and preserve the quality of its market. See Securities Exchange Act Release
No. 34363 (July 13, 1994), 59 FR 36808 (July 19, 1994). The discussion in that approval order is incorporated herein
by reference.

It is Therefore Ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule change (SRNYSE9403) is approved.
