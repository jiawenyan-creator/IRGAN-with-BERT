FT  01 OCT 94 / Profitability hits five-year high
The profitability of UK industrial and commercial companies increased last
year reaching its highest level in percentage terms since 1989, figures
released yesterday by the Central Statistical Office show, Philip Coggan
writes.
The figures show companies' net rate of return, as measured by the ratio of
operating surpluses, or profits, to the capital stock employed. For
industrial and commercial companies, the rate of return was 8.4 per cent in
1993, up from 7 per cent in both 1991 and 1992.
Corporate profitability remains well below the 10 per cent recorded in 1988,
and the all-time peak of 12 per cent in 1964. But the rates of return earned
in 1991 and 1992 were above those recorded in the two previous recessions in
1975 and 1981.
If North Sea companies are excluded, the rate of return recorded last year
was lower, at 7.8 per cent. Manufacturing companies earned a return of just
5.8 per cent. However, both sectors recorded improvements over the returns
earned in 1991 and 1992.
