FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: ICI continues its disposal programme
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's largest manufacturer, yesterday
continued its disposal programme with the sale of the Canadian fert-ilisers
business, Nitrogen Products.
The business was sold to Terra Industries of Sioux City, Iowa. Terms were
not disclosed. However, it is understood that the operations, which included
a 430,000 tonne a year anhydrous ammonia manufacturing plant in Sarnia,
Ontario, and 32 farm service centres called Agromarts, were sold for more
than Pounds 25m. In 1991, they had a turnover of about Pounds 115m.
Nitrogen Products and Agromarts, which supplied Ontario and neighbouring US
states, employed about 550 staff.
In 1991, the group attempted to sell its domestic fertiliser business, with
sales of Pounds 450m a year, to Kemira of Finland. However, the deal was
blocked by the UK government.
