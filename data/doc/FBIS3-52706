<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab, member of </F>
Palestinian team pressing PLO for reforms; place and date not 
given -- recorded; carried within the "With the Events" program] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab, the talks 
with the PLO leadership and the its Executive Committee on PLO 
reforms have ended in Tunis. What decisions or recommendations 
were issued at the end of these talks? 
  [Al-Ashhab] As a matter of fact, we came to Tunis to discuss 
a memorandum presented to the Palestinian leadership two or 
three weeks prior to our arrival in Tunis. As you know, this 
memorandum was signed by 120 Palestinian figures from inside and 
outside [the occupied territories]. We found understanding on 
the part of the Palestinian leadership of these demands. Some 
demands were immediately approved and a mechanism was created to 
implement them. We found that some other ideas were referred to 
PLO institutions. We asked for activating these institutions so 
they could assume their role in implementing what was contained 
in the items of this memorandum. 
  [Mu'addi] What are the ideas to which the PLO leadership has 
responded? 
  [Al-Ashhab] In fact, we stressed national dialogue and 
asserted the need to unify all components of the PLO Executive 
Committee. As you know, some PLO members announced that they 
were freezing their membership. Some of them withdrew and 
others resigned. We asked the leadership to issue a statement 
calling for unified ranks and the return of those brothers to 
the PLO Executive Committee. After this statement, a committee 
under Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi will be set up. This committee will 
contact those brothers, and we will attain this demand for the 
return of those people to the PLO ranks.
