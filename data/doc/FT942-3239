FT  15 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading
Stock index futures overcame early weakness to make strong gains on the day
as the sector responded to US retail sales and consumer price data, writes
Joel Kibazo.
Active selling dominated initial trading in the Liffe FT-SE 100 contract
after it opened at 3,003. As the selling continued, the contract fell to a
low of 2,992 in the first hour of business.
The recovery in UK gilts and European bonds helped to steady the contract
and the return of mid-morning buyers saw it regain some strength. This
gained momentum with the covering of short positions by independent traders.
The US data appeared to dampen the market's recent fears on inflation,
encouraging further buying, but it was the strong response to the figures on
Wall Street which generated a squeeze in June. At the day's peak it touched
3,044 and was at a premium to cash before coming off the top to end at
3,039, at parity with cash. Traders rolled forward positions and volume in
the near month contract reached 22,345 lots, while that in September, which
becomes the lead contract on Friday, was 7,852.
In traded options, turnover returned to more favourable levels, reaching
31,629 lots, of which 10,018 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 5,845 in
the Euro FT-SE. National Power led the stock options at 1,735 contracts.
