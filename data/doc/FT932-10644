FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Imasco sees growth in earnings
IMASCO, the Canadian financial services, tobacco, fast-food and retailing
group, expects 'reasonably good growth' in earnings for 1993 in spite of a
slow first half, said Mr Purdy Crawford, chairman.
The second quarter would be tough, he added, but the second half of 1993
would be healthier.
The company's performance would be affected by loan provisions made by
Canada Trust, the financial services arm, which along with Imperial Tobacco
were Imasco's biggest subsidiaries. The group is 40 per cent held by BAT
Industries of the UK.
Imasco's first-quarter profit was up 5 per cent, but CT's contribution was
reduced by the provisions.
'CT is highly conservative in its provisions and has retained its top credit
rating right through the recession,' Mr Crawford added. He said that the
retailing side had been under pressure but should improve in the second
half. In addition, the improvement at Hardee's, the US fast-food chain, was
continuing.
Imasco's share of the Canadian legal cigarette market was 67 per cent and it
was resuming normal exports after complying with a federal request for
restraint in 1992.
Mr Crawford said that increased smuggling in tobacco products was due to
high Canadian taxes. The restraint reduced Imasco's exports but failed to
affect contraband traffic because smugglers found cigarettes from other
sources.
Imasco has made a deal for Philip Morris to market Canadian-made cigarettes
in the US.
