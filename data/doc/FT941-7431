FT  24 FEB 94 / Restructuring costs force Mitsubishi to cut forecast
Mitsubishi Corporation, Japan's largest trading group, yesterday cut its
profits forecast for the current year because the restructuring it announced
last year would cost much more than expected.
Recession in Japan has also affected trading.
The group warned that it expected net income to fall to a mere Y3bn (Dollars
27.77m) in the year to March, from Y15.3bn.
It had previously forecast only a small reduction to Y15bn this year, its
third annual profit decline.
The main reason is Y80bn of provisions for selling or closing unprofitable
businesses identified in a review of its 600 subsidiaries and affiliates.
Mitsubishi said this compared with Y66bn of provisions in 1992-93 and would
enable the group to start the coming year with a clean balance sheet.
Some of the businesses Mitsubishi bought during its investment excesses in
the late 1980s have turned sour, a problem faced by several leading Japanese
companies during this recession.
Mitsubishi Corporation, which includes oil and fuels, heavy industrial
goods, metals and textiles, is one of several of Japan's keiretsus -
families of companies linked by equity cross-holdings - to reassess their
alliances in the light of recession.
Last year the group disbanded its capital markets division and reorganised
20 to 30 companies including clothing suppliers in Italy and chemicals
interests in Indonesia.
The economy is still difficult and management will continue to monitor asset
quality, said Mitsubishi.
Mitsubishi said capital gains on the sale of securities would cover some of
the restructuring charges.
It expected annual turnover to be unchanged Y14,000bn and planned to
maintain the annual dividend at Y8 per share.
