RECORD RACK: STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN &amp; DOUBLE TROUBLE "IN STEP." EPIC ***: 
ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE(POOR) TO FIVE(A CLASSIC) STARS 
As the last big discovery by the late John Hammond, Vaughan rightly dedicates 
his latest effort to the pioneering record producer and talent scout who died 
two years ago. Vaughan hopscotches between the blues, jazz and rock that his 
benefactor mined so successfully in discoveries from Benny Goodman and Billie 
Holiday to Dylan and Springsteen. Vaughan doesn't take any quantum leaps beyond 
the raucous roadhouse blues and rock he has traversed already in three studio 
albums and one live recording, but he can still set fire to a guitar quicker 
than you can say "Jack Flash." The closing tune, "Riviera Paradise," seems 
designed to show that Vaughan can shine in low gear as well as overdrive, but 
the nearly 9-minute, moody excursion waffles between introspective blues and 
lazy lounge jazz, falling too often on the snoozy side of the street. Mostly, 
though, it's blazing business as usual. RANDY LEWIS
