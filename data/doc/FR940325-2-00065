[GSA Bulletin FTR 12]


March 17, 1994.


To: Heads of Federal agencies
Subject: Reimbursement of higher actual subsistence expenses for travel to Augusta (Richmond County), Georgia



1. 

Purpose.

 This bulletin informs agencies of the establishment of a special actual subsistence expense ceiling for official
travel to Augusta (Richmond County), Georgia, due to the escalation of lodging rates during the annual Masters Golf
Tournament held there. This special rate applies to claims for reimbursement covering travel during the period April
4, 1994, through April 10, 1994.
2. 

Background.

 The Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) (41 CFR chapters 301304) part 3018 permits the Administrator of
General Services to establish a higher maximum daily rate for the reimbursement of actual subsistence expenses of
Federal employees on official travel to an area within the continental United States. The head of an agency may request
establishment of such a rate when special or unusual circumstances result in an extreme increase in subsistence costs
for a temporary period. The Secretary of Transportation (DOT) requested establishment of such a rate for Augusta
to accommodate employees who perform temporary duty there and experience a temporary but significant increase in
lodging costs due to the escalation of lodging rates during the annual Masters Golf Tournament. These circumstances
justify the need for higher subsistence expense reimbursement in Augusta during the designated period.
3. 

Maximum rate and effective date.

 The Administrator of General Services, pursuant to 41 CFR 3018.3(c), has increased the maximum daily amount
of reimbursement that may be approved for actual and necessary subsistence expenses for official travel to Augusta
(Richmond County), Georgia for travel during the period April 4, 1994, through April 10, 1994. Agencies may approve
actual subsistence expense reimbursement not to exceed $210.00 ($184.00 maximum for lodging and a $26.00 allowance
for meals and incidental expenses) for travel to Augusta (Richmond County), Georgia, during this time period.
4. 

Expiration date.

 This bulletin expires on September 30, 1994.
