FT  21 JUL 92 / Midland ends fees for supplying cash
MIDLAND BANK said yesterday that it had halted an initiative by local
managers to charge for supplying small businesses with cash across the
counter.
The move followed a letter from the bank's Sheffield area office to hundreds
of Midland's business customers in the Yorkshire area, including publicans
and shopkeepers, telling them that they would have to pay for all cash
supplied across the counter.
Small businesses in Dewsbury and Barnsley were indignant that they would be
charged Pounds 1.50 per Pounds 100 of cash exchanged, with a minimum of
Pounds 2 per transaction. Customers without a Midland account would be
charged more.
Payment would have been deducted from the customer's account the following
day or taken in cash at the time the money was handed over.
Midland said yesterday: 'It was a local area initiative. We don't want to be
too specific about who took the decision, because it might cause
embarrassment, but it was stopped by head office as soon as they heard about
it.'
