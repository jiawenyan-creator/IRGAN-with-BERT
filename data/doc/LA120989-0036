EVEN IN VICTORY, SOME FIND REASONS TO COMPLAIN 
After the Raider coaching change and the resurgence of Raider football, I 
couldn't understand why only 40,000 fans would attend the next several games. 
I found out why last Sunday, as I was one of the 90,000 fans who attended the 
Denver game. 
Either the Raider coaching staff is stupid or they are quitters. When you are 
behind, 10-6, and you have a first-and-10 on your 30-yard line with 30 seconds 
remaining, it is permissible to attempt to advance the ball! 
Whadaya know? The Raiders won anyway. I saw fans leaving in the fourth quarter 
while the game was tied. Some fans are quitters, too.
