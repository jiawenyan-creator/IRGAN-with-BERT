FT  22 MAR 94 / People: Derwent Valley Foods
Paul Revell is the new managing director of Derwent Valley Foods,
manufacturer of one of the more successful snackfood brands to be invented
in recent years.
Revell (left) had a ten-year stint with United Biscuits before joining DVF,
most recently as commercial director of McVitie's (UK). UB bought DVF in
February 1993 for Pounds 24m. Before his job with McVitie's, Revell worked
in another UB branch, KP Foods. A decade's experience of snackfood brands
will be useful for Revell's steerage of DVF's Phileas Fogg snacks, a premium
range including eccentric nibbles such as Tortilla Chips and Punjab Puri.
DVF's founder and former managing director, Roger McKechnie, has stepped
down from his chairmanship of the company though stays on as a non-executive
director. He set up DVF in 1982; by 1986 it was joint winner of a Business
Enterprise Award.
McKechnie has now ploughed some of his Pounds 2m cash from UB's acquisition
of DVF into a new venture called the Medomsley Road Seed Capital Company,
which - as its name implies - provides seed capital for start-up companies
in the north-east of England.
