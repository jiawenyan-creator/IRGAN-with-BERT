FT  10 SEP 93 / BT offers 1.9% pay increase
BT YESTERDAY said it had made a 'final' pay offer of 1.9 per cent to 110,000
engineers and clerical workers.
The increase, backdated to July 1, would take a technical officer's maximum
pay from Pounds 17,770 to Pounds 18,108 and a clerical officer's maximum pay
from Pounds 13,840 to Pounds 14,103.
Mr Peter Archer, director of employee relations, said that the company
believed the offer was reasonable. 'Although 1992-93 was a relatively good
year, there is a continuing need for us to reduce costs in real terms and
not to mortgage our future by awarding unrealistic pay increases on rates
which are already high by comparison with our competitors,' he said.
The National Communication Union, the main BT union, said it would meet on
Monday to consider the offer.
