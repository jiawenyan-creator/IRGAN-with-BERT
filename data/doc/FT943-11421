FT  30 JUL 94 / P&amp;O threat over animal welfare
P&amp;O, one of the largest cross-Channel ferry companies, yesterday threatened
to stop transporting vehicles carrying animals for slaughter unless European
farm ministers agreed on improved standards.
The company set next October as the deadline for an 'imminent prospect' of
European Union legislation to deal with the mounting controversy over
conditions for live export.
Lord Sterling, P&amp;O chairman, said last night that the company had acted
after reviewing legislation on animal transport standards. This had shown
that there was 'no way' these could be enforced.
P&amp;O's decision follows an increasingly vociferous campaign by animal-rights
groups against the conditions in which sheep and cattle are transported to
continental slaughterhouses. Animals often travel for several days in packed
lorries without food or water. Last month, Mr Alan Clark, the former trade
minister and campaigner against animal cruelty, joined other activists in
calling for a boycott of cross-Channel ferry companies which transported
animals for slaughter.
Lord Sterling said that his decision to put pressure on government was not
out of concern for the damage that a boycott might do to his company. 'It's
deeper than that,' he said. 'There are certain subjects that go beyond
commercial considerations.'
Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, said the government was
determined to make progress on the issue without causing unfair disadvantage
to British farmers. But 'those urging precipitate action would do nothing to
protect travelling animals in the long term, and would impose an immediate
damaging effect on a trade already going through a difficult period'.
