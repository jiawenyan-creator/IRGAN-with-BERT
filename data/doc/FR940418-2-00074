Title:

 Laboratory Performance Evaluation Studies for Water Analyses (EPA No. 0234.05; OMB No. 20800021). This ICR
requests an extension to an existing information collection. 


Abstract:

 Pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act (Public Law 93523) 40 CFR parts 141 through 142, and the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92500), the EPA's Environmental Monitoring Systems
Laboratory (EMSL-CIN) must conduct performance evaluation (PE) studies on laboratories that routinely analyze
several types of water samples. There are three types of PE studies that are conducted:



(1) Water Pollution (WP) Studies, which provide EPA with information on laboratories producing critical data for
regulatory purposes, and to support the wastewater certification programs administered by many States; 
(2) Discharge Monitoring Report-Quality Assurance (DMR-QA) Studies, which provide EPA with an objective estimate
of the analytical capability of laboratories performing self-monitoring analyses, as required in major National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits; and
(3) Water Supply (WS) Studies, which support the drinking water laboratory certification program administered
by the States.
On a routine basis, EMSL-CIN will distribute samples containing concentrations of chemical that are unknown to the
receiving laboratory. The laboratory analyzes the samples and reports their results by completing the appropriate
EPA form and returning it to EMSL-CIN for evaluation. EMSL-CIN sends each laboratory a copy of their performance evaluation
that includes the data they submitted to EMSL-CIN, the true values of the related study and PE limits, and an evaluation
for each reported value. 
The results are used by EPA, State, and private laboratory personnel to identify and correct analytical deficiencies
of laboratories, thereby improving the data quality of their monitoring operations. WP and WS study results can be
decisive in the laboratory certification process, and DMR-QA study results are used to target NPDES laboratories
with apparent analytical problems for on-site inspection by EPA or State regulatory personnel.


Burden Statement:

 Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 8 hours per response including
the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing information sources, and completing and reviewing the
collection of information.


Respondents:

 Businesses or other for-profit organizations, non-profit institutions, small businesses or organizations, State
and local organizations.


Estimated Number of Respondents:

 17,700.


Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent:

 1.


Frequency of Collection:

 Semiannually for WP and WS Studies, annually for DMR-QA Studies.


Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents:

 141,550.
Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other 

aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for 
reducing the burden, to:




Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (2136), 401 M Street, SW., Washington,
DC 20460.




and
