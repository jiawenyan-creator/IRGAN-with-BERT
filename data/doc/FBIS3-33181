  [Text] In 1993, more than 100 tons of fuel-oil were saved 
by the biogas plants in Ciego de Avila Province in response to 
the instructions given of taking advantage of renewable energy 
sources. At the closing of 1993, Ciego de Avila Province had 12 
biogas units in use and it is expected that they will increase 
that figure as part of the generalization of an initiative that 
is being implemented in that province. 
  The biogas plants use leftovers obtained from sugar mills or 
cattle manure to produce methane gas which is used for cooking 
at work center cafeterias and homes, for lighting at dairy 
farms, as well as in the metallurgic industry. The largest 
biogas plant in Cuba was built on the island of Turiguano and it 
has the capacity of generating 2,000 cubic meters of methane gas 
per day through the process of fermenting the manure obtained 
from a nearby cattle ranch.
