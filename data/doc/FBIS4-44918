<H5>  5. Technical Guidance </H5>
  As was stated in Chapter 1, the research laboratories 
affiliated with AIST share basic research with each other. One 
of the responsibilities of AIST is to widely disseminate the 
technology and know-how that has been accumulating over many 
years. 
  In the meantime, AIST research laboratories have been 
receiving strong demands for technical assistance and 
consultation regarding fundamental and basic research. 
  Therefore, in 1957, AIST decided to open a technical 
assistance center in its main headquarters. Later, it opened 
technical assistance centers at affiliated research 
organizations. Those parties desiring technical assistance 
should contact a technical assistance center (or technical 
exchange and promotion center) at any of the AIST research 
laboratories. 
  In accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations Governing 
Inventions Made with AIST Technical Assistance, which was 
approved by the Diet on February 25, 1972, each research 
laboratory must exchange written confirmations with the 
organizations with whom it is rendering assistance concerning 
how inventions pertaining to said technical assistance will be 
administered given the possibility of an invention. 
  AIST has established what are called liaison committees to 
facilitate research exchanges, help with staff training, and 
build cooperation with public examination and technology 
centers. These were first formed in 1954 in order to raise the 
technological level of local industries, particularly growth 
industries, and to place more emphasis on R&amp;D in local public 
research institutions.
