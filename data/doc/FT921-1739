FT  23 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Brent Walker rescue moves a step nearer
THE Pounds 1.65bn refinancing marathon at Brent Walker appears to be finally
drawing to a close with lawyers working over the weekend to incorporate the
final changes to documentation as requested by the leisure group's bank-ers.
Mr John Leach, Brent Walker's finance director, said the group expected
official agreement from the banks on the refinancing by next Tuesday, when
bond holder and shareholder resolutions on the plan expire.
However, Mr Leach sounded a note of caution - well aware that the Brent
Walker negotiations, which began in November 1990, have been some of the
longest and most tortuous in UK corporate history. 'I will believe it is
done when it is done,' he said.
If there is a last-minute hitch, the group will have to call another
extraordinary meeting for shareholder approval of the plan which aims to
convert Pounds 250m of secured bank debt into ordinary and preference
shares. Such a move could throw the refinancing into doubt and push Brent
Walker into receivership.
There are four major agreements which need final approval from Brent
Walker's 50-odd banks. A final draft had been sent to bankers last week and
was returned with nothing more than adjustments to the documentation, said
Mr Leach. The final documentation was expected to have been sent to the
banks today.
Bankers to William Hill, the bookmaking chain bought from Grand Metropolitan
for Pounds 679m in 1989, are also expected to give their official approval
to the refinancing.
The dispute with GrandMet over payments on William Hill had been sidelined,
said Mr Leach. 'There has been no progress on GrandMet. We have agreed to
let negotiations continue.'
