FT  06 JUL 92 / Observer: Enough Frost - Ed
Hello, good morning and welcome back. It was rather surprising to read two
long and flattering centre page features about the same media star, David
Frost, the day after each other in The Independent on Saturday and The
Independent on Sunday.
The kind interpretation is that the clash demonstrates the robust editorial
independence of the supposedly integrated stable-mates. Even so, it tends to
make some investors nervous when one side of the business is not telling the
other what it is doing.
