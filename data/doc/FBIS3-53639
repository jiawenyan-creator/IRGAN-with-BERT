  [Text] Islamabad (PPI) -- A Foreign Office spokesman said 
here on Monday that the Pakistan-Afghanistan border has not been 
closed and it is open for those Afghan nationals, who are 
traveling on valid visas. Those people who want to come without 
any visa, however, will not be allowed to enter Pakistan. The 
spokesman added that seriously wounded persons have been allowed 
to enter Pakistan even without visas or other relevant documents. 
  The spokesman said Pakistan is cooperating with UN relief 
agencies to supply food and other relief materials to Afghan 
refugees in Jalalabad, and a big convoy carrying food and other 
materials will leave for Jalalabad on Tuesday. He disclosed 
that Pakistan will set up a hospital camp at Jalalabad to 
provide medical aid to those wounded in the battle. He added 
that Pakistan is providing every possible assistance to the 
Afghan refugees in Jalalabad. 
  The spokesman said that fighting is taking place only in 
Kabul; other areas are peaceful and, hence, the people wounded 
in Kabul can be moved to other areas for medical treatment. 
There is, therefore, no justification for opening the Pakistani 
border for Afghan nationals trying to enter the country without 
any visa. He said Foreign Secretary Shaharyar M. Khan has met 
the UN representative on Afghanistan and assured him of 
Pakistan's help in providing aid to Afghanistan. The foreign 
secretary has also met the high commissioner for Afghan refugees 
in this regard.
