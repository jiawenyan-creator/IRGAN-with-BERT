THE WORLD 
Iran accused high-ranking officers and a senior Foreign Ministry official of 
being members of a U.S. espionage ring whose exposure was announced last week. 
IRNA, the Iranian news agency, said that Bahman Aqaei, Foreign Ministry expert 
on legal affairs, had been working for the CIA since 1983. It also named half a 
dozen other military officials as senior officers in the ring, which it said 
had passed information to Iraq during the Persian Gulf War. A White House 
spokesman has said that Washington is unaware of any such ring.
