THE WORLD; 
MEXICO UNIONISTS FACE TRIAL 
A judge ordered 46 leaders of Mexico's oil workers union to stand trial on 
charges of arms smuggling and corruption, and a union official said that arrest 
warrants have been issued for as many as 35 others in a further crackdown on 
the powerful labor organization. Police last week arrested the 46, including 
union boss Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, in a move to abolish graft in the top 
ranks of the union. Judge Jose Luis Garcia Vasco denied bail to 18 of the 46 
and postponed bail hearings for Hernandez Galicia and three others until later 
this week. Union attorney Carlos Castro Esparza said he expects additional 
arrests soon as new warrants are served.
