FT  17 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Nafta to be signed as opponents start
campaign
US OPPONENTS of the North American Free Trade Agreement, due to be signed in
Washington today, are about to launch an advertising campaign against it.
Critics of the US-Canada-Mexico deal say it is 'a wrecking ball' aimed at
the US economy and a potential environmental disaster.
The Mexican government wants Nafta passed as soon as possible: it expects a
current deficit of Dollars 20bn this year and sees it as essential to
attract foreign capital.
The Economic Strategy Institute in Washington yesterday recommended
far-reaching changes in the agreement. It wants US textile quotas from other
exporting nations shifted to Mexico in order to prevent job losses in the US
industry.
