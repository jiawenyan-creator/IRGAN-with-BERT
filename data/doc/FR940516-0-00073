<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its adjudication regulations concerning presumptive service
connection for certain diseases resulting from exposure to ionizing radiation during military service. Congress
has added cancer of the urinary tract to the list of radiogenic conditions for which presumptive service connection
is authorized, but did not indicate which entities it considers part of the urinary tract. This amendment is intended
to define the term ``urinary tract'' for VA purposes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 VA published in the 

Federal Register

 of October 5, 1993 (58 FR 5179899) a proposed amendment to 38 CFR 3.309(d) to define the term ``urinary tract''
for purposes of implementing the presumption of service connection for urinary tract cancers based on exposure to
ionizing radiation established in the Radiation Exposure Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102578. Interested
parties were invited to submit written comments on or before November 4, 1993. Since no comments were received on the
proposed rule, the final rule is adopted as proposed, effective October 1, 1992, the date provided by Public Law 102578.



The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601612. The reason
for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and
final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604.




The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program numbers are 64.104 and 64.109.
