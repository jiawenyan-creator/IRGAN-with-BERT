SANTA MONICA WOMAN GETS BACK BABY, A PARROT SHE'S HAD 40 YEARS 
Magda Wilson's Baby is home again. The 80-year-old Santa Monica woman who 
suffered a heart-wrenching loss July 1 when the outspoken parrot she had owned 
for nearly 40 years was apparently stolen outside her apartment was reunited 
with her pet late Monday night. 
"He just ate and ate and ate, and when he was done, he said, 'You wanna go to 
bed? You wanna go to bed?' He was so tired," Wilson said today. "I'm very happy 
now." 
Wilson got Baby back after a young woman identified only as "Blanca" put her in 
touch with a man who had apparently purchased the bird on the Santa Monica 
Pier, police said. After a weekend of negotiations, the parties met Monday 
night in front of a house on Pacific Coast Highway where the man, who remains 
unidentified, gave Wilson her parrot in exchange for a reimbursement of the 
$100 purchase price.
