  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota -- (Gustavo Alvarez Larrazabal), 
the controversial mayor of the city of Tulua, has celebrated the 
withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Juanchaco area and issued a 
special decree calling for the full hoisting of the flag, which 
was at half-mast up to today. 
  He has announced simultaneously he will preside over a 
ceremony at the main plaza to hoist the flag to the top of the 
mast at the City Mayor's Office. The flag had been hoisted at 
half-mast when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers arrived. 
  In the municipal decree, the city mayor said he trusts 
foreign soldiers will never again arrive there without complying 
with legal requirements.
