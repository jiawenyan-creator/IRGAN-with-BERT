  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 26 (YONHAP) -- Seoul has asked 
Washington not to extend the visa of former presidential aide 
Kim Chong-hwi nor grant him permanent residentship, Vice Foreign 
Minister Hong Sun-yong said Wednesday. 
  "We requested that the United States be prudent in extending 
his visa or giving him residentship in consideration of the fact 
that Kim once served in diplomacy and national security and that 
he is implicated in an irregularity," Hong said. 
  Washington formally confirmed Wednesday morning that Kim has 
applied for permanent residentship. 
  "It was a preliminary confirmation," he said. "It's 
preliminary because Washington has not given any details other 
than that Kim has applied, such as where or how he applied." 
  Seoul officials say they do not know Kim's whereabouts. The 
former top presidential secretary for diplomacy and national 
security left for the United States last April as a guest 
researcher at the Heritage Foundation. 
  He has virtually been in hiding since reports in Seoul that 
he took bribes from lobbyists selling arms to Korea for its 
Yulgok (military modernization) project. 
  Hong suggested Seoul could go beyond seeking U.S. refusal of 
residentship, commonly called a "green card," saying his 
ministry will have to consult with the Justice Ministry on 
whether to make additional requests to Washington. 
  Sources said that one possible request would be to have the 
Americans investigate Kim. 
  Washington officials told Seoul via the South Korean Embassy 
that they will take Kim's case into consideration and make a 
prudent decision after internal consultation. 
  "There are many legal aspects to consider," Hong said. "The 
decision will take time."
