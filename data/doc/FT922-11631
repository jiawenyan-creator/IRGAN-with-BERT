FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Ralston may spin off baking
subsidiary
RALSTON Purina, the consumer products company which last week acquired Ever
Ready, the UK battery business, from Hanson for Dollars 227m, is considering
spinning-off of its baking subsidiary to shareholders.
Ralston said the aim of the move was 'to enhance shareholder value by
focusing more specifically on its other core businesses'.
The subsidiary, Continental Baking Company, claims to be the nation's
largest wholesale baker of fresh delivered bread and sweet baked goods, and
makes about 250,000 direct sales calls and deliveries each day. Its brands
include the Wonder bread products and Twinkies cupcakes.
The bakery business was bought by Ralston in 1984 from ITT, the
conglomerate.
In the year to end-September, the company had sales of Dollars 1.97bn, and
total assets of Dollars 765m. Its operating profit was Dollars 140m, after
environmental and restructuring charges of Dollars 17m.
The 'demerger' plan will be reviewed by directors of Ralston, based in St
Louis, on May 28.
Even if it is approved, tax clearances and other technical matters will have
to be resolved, and the transaction would probably not take place for
another nine to 12 months.
Ralston said the move would probably involve a dividend of up to Dollars
600m being paid from Continental Baking Company to Ralston.
Ralston's proposed moves come amid a modest spate of demergers in the US -
ranging from Union Carbide, with its industrial gases business, to Dial
Corporation with its financial services division.
The bakery market in the US - in common with the UK - is a mature industry,
with total sales of Dollars 7.4bn and static volumes in 1991. Continental
saw lower volumes in 1991, although higher margins meant operating profit
was flat.
