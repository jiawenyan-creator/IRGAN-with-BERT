METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CATHOLIC BISHOPS URGE IMMIGRATION LAW 
REVIEW 
California's Roman Catholic bishops, meeting Friday in Los Angeles, unanimously 
adopted a resolution urging Congress to review the employer sanctions section 
of an immigration law that a General Accounting Office report says has caused 
"widespread discrimination" against foreign-looking but legal American 
citizens. 
The resolution, submitted by Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony to two 
dozen bishops, welcomed the federal report on the 1986 Immigration Reform and 
Control Act released Thursday in Washington. 
"Employer sanctions have not only threatened (employment rights), but have 
created an atmosphere of fear, mistrust and blatant employment discrimination," 
the bishops' statement said.
