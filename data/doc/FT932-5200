FT  04 JUN 93 / Observer: Management man
Could Tim Hely Hutchinson, founder of Headline Books, be the new Paul Hamlyn
of British publishing? Having just agreed a Pounds 49m takeover of the
125-year-old publishers Hodder &amp; Stoughton, he was refreshingly modest when
Observer popped the question yesterday.
He stresses that he is not nearly as innovative as the fabulously wealthy
Hamlyn, founder of Octopus Books and creator of a whole new consumer
publishing sector. 'I'm only a manager,' says Hely Hutchinson, whose father,
the Earl of Donoughmore, will be non-executive chairman of the enlarged
group.
Whereas Hamlyn is reckoned to be worth Pounds 180m, Hely Hutchinson only
owns 3 per cent of Headline, which just about makes him a millionaire. But
he is almost as young as Hamlyn was when he sold his first business to Cecil
King's IPC in 1964 and thereby coined his initial million.
Given that he is nearly 30 years younger than 67-year-old Hamlyn, and
probably running the second largest independent publisher after Macmillan,
young Tim is not doing too badly.
