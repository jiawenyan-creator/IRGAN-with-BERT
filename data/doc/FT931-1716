particularly in the UK and Belgium. On a like-for-like basis turnover fell
by about 5 per cent.

(Pounds 8.6m) representing end-year gearing of 25 (26) per cent.

(Pounds 38.9m) but operating profits in the home market slumped to Pounds
4.15m (Pounds 7.09m) reflecting a particularly weak market in the final
quarter and high investment costs in new sites.

with the business in Belgium in particular lifting its operating profit to
Pounds 2.11m (Pounds 1.37m) on turnover which grew to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds
9.43m).
Overall, 41 per cent of group operating profits came from outside the UK and
Ireland compared with 23 per cent in 1991.

completed shortly after the of the year and resulted in an extraordinary
loss of Pounds 4.8m, including Pounds 2.2m of goodwill transferred from
reserves.
