FT  19 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
Australian wool prices have continued to show an easier tendency this week.
Declines have been sharpest among finer Merinos, but throughout the range of
categories there have been varied and erratic changes from day to day. Much
depends on the quality of the offering, and overall there is a tendency for
this to fall off towards the end of the selling season, especially when
drought has been a factor in many areas. The AWC market indicator declined
to 610c on March 18, against 638 a week before. The market setback is being
accepted without undue concern, since it folows a good rise in February.
