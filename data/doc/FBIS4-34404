  [Text] Presidential candidates Samper and Pastrana are 
touring Colombia hours before the election. M-19 [19 April 
Movement] leaders Otti Patino, Gloria Quinceno, Eduardo Chavez, 
and German Rojas have told their followers they should not vote 
for Ernesto Samper, because what the country wants is a 
government of unity, not a party government. 
  [Begin Pastrana recording] I condemn any attempt to buy 
votes, no matter what. We want an open and clean election, and 
that is exactly for what we are going to fight. We are going to 
work to defeat the old policy, those who believe that by buying 
consciences and votes they can reach power. [end recording] 
  Regarding the Liberal Party, Juan Diego Jaramillo expressed 
his support today for presidential candidate Ernesto Samper. 
Meanwhile, Samper said he is not worried about the tie the 
recent polls are indicating. 
  [Begin Samper recording] Polls do not worry me. They 
indicate a tie, but if you compare these polls with other polls 
you will see there is an upward trend, and I believe that trend 
will benefit me during the 19 June election. [end recording]
