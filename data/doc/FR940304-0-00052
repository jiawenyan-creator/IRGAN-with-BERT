 

Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not require any information collection activities and therefore no approval is necessary under the
Paperwork Reduction Act.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96354) requires the Federal Government to anticipate and reduce the
impact of regulations and paperwork requirements on small businesses. The primary impact of this final rule is on
State governments and individuals. Therefore, we certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities because it affects benefits to individuals and payments to States. Thus,
a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.
