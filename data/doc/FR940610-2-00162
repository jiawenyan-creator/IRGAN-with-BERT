June 3, 1994.



On March 10, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SRNYSE9408) under section 19(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Notice of the proposed rule change was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 18, 1994, to solicit comments from interested persons.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 No comments were received by the Commission. This order approves the proposal.

I. Description of the Proposal



The proposed rule change will allow the NYSE to implement its On-Line Comparison System (``OCS''). With OCS, NYSE
clearing members will be able to submit trade data on listed stocks to NYSE on trade date for initial comparison. Implementation
of NYSE's same-day comparison will be in a phased-in approach similar to that which was used to implement next-day
(``T+1'') comparison of NYSE transactions.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE's target date for full implementation of trade-date comparison is June 30, 1995. The NYSE filed this proposal
with the Commission to provide the NYSE community with almost eighteen months advance notice in order to afford them
time to plan and implement the operational changes that may be necessary.

</FOOTNAME>
In March 1989, the Commission approved the NYSE's Rule 130. That rule, which was used to implement overnight comparison
over the eighteen months following its approval, established the principle that ``regular way'' transactions in
listed stocks, rights, and warrants must be compared or closed out within one business day after the trade date. Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 26627 (March 14, 1989) 54 FR 11470 [File No. SRNYSE8836] (order approving
proposed rule change).

</FOOTNAME>
The NYSE has distributed to its members a circular, dated January 29, 1994, describing implementation of trade date
comparison.

</FOOTNOTE>


Beginning on June 1, 1994, the NYSE will require its member clearing firms to submit to it periodically during the trading
day trade data for transactions in listed stocks, rights, and warrants effected on the NYSE for ``regular way,''
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 ``next day,''
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 ``cash,''
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 and ``seller's option'' settlement.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Trade data for transactions in listed stocks traded on an ``issued,'' ``when issued,''
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 and ``when distributed''
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 basis also will have to be submitted periodically during the trading day. The NYSE's existing Overnight Comparison
System will be the main processor of the data submitted for initial comparison. Accordingly, the NYSE has changed
that system's name to the On-Line Comparison System and will continue to use the same acronym of OCS. Compared trades
will be submitted by the NYSE to a ``qualified clearing agency''
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 to complete the clearance and settlement process.

A ``when issued'' stock refers to a stock which trades after the date of issue but before the certificates have been
issued. NYSE Rule 440B.16; D. Scott, Wall Street Words 385 (1988).

A ``when distributed'' stock refers to a stock which trades after the date of issue but before the certificates have
been issued. NYSE Rule 440B.16; D. Scott, Wall Street Words 385 (1988).

<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
For this purpose, the term ``qualified clearing agency'' means a clearing agency that is registered under the Act,
that maintains facilities through which NYSE trades may be compared or settled, that has agreed to supply the NYSE
with data in connection with the NYSE's compliance duties under the Act, and that has agreed to establish rules and
procedures to facilitate comparison of transactions as provided in NYSE Rule 130. NYSE Rules 130, Supplementary
Material .10, and 132, Supplementary Material .10.

</FOOTNOTE>


Implementation of trade-date comparison will require clearing firms to meet three general requirements. First,
they will have to suppress certain comparison data submissions to qualified clearing agencies as the NYSE locks-in
additional trades. Second, they will have to submit their comparison data to the NYSE for comparison rather than to
a qualified clearing agency. Third, they will have to submit virtually all comparison data to the NYSE during the trading
session rather than after the close of trading.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
While the NYSE's ultimate goal is to lock-in all trades electronically and to have all trades compared during the trading
session, as a practical matter, there will be trades at the close or immediately before or after the close that are not
submitted for comparison during the trading session. This will be especially true in the early stages of the proposal's
implementation. Conversation between Harry F. Day, Counsel-Regulation, NYSE; Stanley Jacoby, Trade Comparison
Specialist, Post Trade Services, NYSE; and Thomas C. Etter, Jr., Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Commission
(May 27, 1994).

</FOOTNOTE>


As mentioned above, the implementation of trade date comparison will use a phased-in approach, which the NYSE found
successful in implementing T+1 overnight comparison. Beginning June 1, 1994, NYSE clearing members will be required
to submit trade data directly to OCS within two hours of trade execution. In August or September of 1994, clearing members
will be required to submit trade data within one hour of execution. In October of 1994, clearing members will be required
to make on-line, real time submissions of trade data. These time frames are flexible and may be altered by the NYSE as
it evaluates clearing firms' abilities to comply. The NYSE intends to monitor closely the implementation of each
phase and will not implement a new phase until it is satisfied that no significant operational problems exist.
