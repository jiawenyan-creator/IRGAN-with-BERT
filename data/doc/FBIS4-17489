  [Text] Belgrade, 24 Apr -- Radovan Karadzic, president of 
the Serb Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Momcilo Krajisnik, 
head of the Serb Republic parliament, received in Pale today an 
official Russian parliamentary delegation, headed by Nikolay 
Bezborodov, deputy chairman of the State Duma Defense and 
Security Committee. 
  During the course of the conversation, the leaders of the 
Serb Republic expressed gratitude to the Russian 
parliamentarians for their arrival at the critical moment of the 
declaration of the NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs. 
  At a time when an agreement is being concluded with the 
representatives of the United Nations on localizing the pocket 
of conflict in Gorazde, they are again presenting us with an 
ultimatum, threatening the use of force and thus trying to 
impose on us decisions which are alien to us, M. Krajisnik, the 
parliamentary chairman, said during the conversation. 
  At the same time, he expressed the hope that the Russian 
parliamentarians would take an objective view of the situation 
and would make the correct conclusions. 
  The head of the Russian delegation said that the deputies, 
who represent the majority of the factions in the Duma, in many 
ways agree with the Serbian side's view of what is happening and 
the ways of solving urgent problems. The speediest 
establishment of peace is the chief element toards solving the 
Bosnian crisis, N. Bezborodov said. He also stressed the 
importance of lifting the sanctions, saying that once the 
delegation had returned to Moscow with its report, the Duma will 
continue its debate on the question of sanctions.
