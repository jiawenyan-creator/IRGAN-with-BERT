FT  03 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: WMC to cut nickel production
WESTERN Mining Corporation (WMC), the Australian metals producer, has
confirmed production cuts at its Western Australian nickel operations in
response to low world nickel prices.
The company has also announced that its Chibougamau gold/copper mine in
Canada will be put up for sale. WMC directors said yesterday the company's
nickel division was operating at a loss at current nickel prices.
Directors did not spell out the exact extent of nickel production cuts
likely for the current full year, but they said operational changes would be
made at both the Kambalda and Leinster complexes.
'The nickel division will continue with its previously-announced long-term
expansion and cost-reduction strategy with the objective of lowering total
costs below Dollars 2.50 per pound,' they said.
'Every endeavour is being made to urgently reduce current spending and
enhance WMC's competitive position. The nickel division operations will
remain under review having regard to the continuing necessity to reduce
costs and the fluctuations in the nickel price.'
The Chibougamau oper-ations were marginally economic and could not be
sustained at current metal prices. If a sale could not be completed by
January 31 1993, the operations would be closed and site reclamation
commenced, the company said.
The Australian Mining Industry Council (AMIC) has released figures
indicating that net profits of Australian mining companies fell 27 per cent
in the 1991-92 year to ADollars 1.87bn (USDollars 1.2bn).
It was the industry's second consecutive year of significant decline, with
earnings peaking at Dollars A4.33bn in 1990. It was also the industry's
lowest level of profits since 1987.
