  [Text] Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien has said the 
next PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] candidate for 
president will have sufficient time for his electoral campaign. 
He has also said he is sure the federal elections will be held 
as scheduled. Chretien has said the Mexican Government and 
people acted coolheadedly after Luis Donaldo Colosio's 
assassination. 
  [Begin Chretien recording, in English fading into Spanish 
translation] I do not think the crisis will last long. I am 
under the impression Salinas' party will appoint a candidate 
very soon and that the struggle will continue until August. [end 
recording] 
  In a news conference held at the Canadian Embassy, Chretien 
has said no final decision has been made on the presence of 
Canadian observers in the federal elections. The prime 
minister, who has already departed, has said he is not offering 
Mexico any special assistance for the time being, because 
Mexico's financial market is stable.
