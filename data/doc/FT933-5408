FT  03 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: No proper recognition or advocacy for
UK's scientists/engineers (1)
Sir, I looked at the complex issues involved in John Authers' well-reasoned
article ('Discipline in need of a better chemistry', August 28) wearing
three different hats. I am a chartered engineer with more than a decade's
experience in industry; I have just finished a management doctorate
searching for better ways to support technical innovation; and I am at
present an unemployment statistic finding few people interested in promoting
technical innovation.
Industry seems to care little whether or not its engineers have science
degrees, and even less about their innovative ideas. Those who speak for the
engineering professions, despite some admirable advocacy, still lapse into
complacency at times - witness the Engineering Council's lack of clear
guidance on innovation.
As for government, its chosen solution seems to be to support science by
cutting art - like some manic doctor who tries to increase the patient's red
blood cell count by killing off the white cells that combat disease.
Perhaps the truth is that the rhetoric of blame is easier than the language
of real action. We need to innovate - to promote new products,
organisational changes, and 'lean' manufacturing methods. Neither art nor
science alone can provide the answer - we need the liberal arts to teach us
to spot the rhetoric of inaction, just as we need science to allow us to
replace it with real and effective action.
