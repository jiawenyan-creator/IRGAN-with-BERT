ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; 
POLICE GIVE WARNINGS ON MINOR WARRANTS 
A new Costa Mesa police policy allows people caught with outstanding 
misdemeanor warrants to get a warning rather than a trip to jail, a top police 
official said Thursday. 
Under a policy adopted by the department, only people who received a warrant 
for skipping an appearance in Harbor Municipal Court will get hauled off to see 
the judge, Police Capt. Tom Lazar said. All others are simply warned to clear 
up their warrants and set free, unless officers from the department that 
originally arrested them want to come and get them. 
Without the change of policy -- it was quietly instituted about two months ago 
-- Costa Mesa officers would have to drive prisoners wanted for violations in 
other jurisdictions directly to County Jail, sharply reducing patrol time, 
Lazar said. 
For years, Costa Mesa officers avoided the drive and wait at the central jail 
by simply dropping off warrant violators at Harbor Court. There, all of those 
whose warrants were issued in other Municipal Courts would be held in a 
marshal's lockup to await a sheriff's bus for a ride to jail. 
But during the summer, the Sheriff's Department stopped providing the bus 
service for warrant violators. 
Sheriff's Lt. Richard J. Olson said the service was stopped because the 
prisoners would have to wait hours before receiving medical checks upon their 
arrival at the main jail. Without the checks, the Sheriff's Department could be 
exposed to legal liability if a prisoner were later found to be seriously ill 
or injured. 
Harbor Court handles cases originating in Costa Mesa, Newport Beach and Irvine.
