WELLMAN'S TOUCHDOWN: SHADOW OF DOUBT 
Regarding the photo in The Times on Nov. 25 showing Gary Wellman's knee 
supposedly touching the end zone inbounds, I find it interesting that there's a 
shadow under Wellman's knee. How could his knee be touching the ground and 
still have a shadow under it? 
Moreover, if his knee was as inbounds as the photo supposedly shows, it would 
not correlate with the TV picture. 
Let's face it: The TD should not have been allowed.
