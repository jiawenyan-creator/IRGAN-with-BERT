FT  20 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Marina accepts 180p offer from Yattendon
Tst
Marina Developments, which operates 16 marinas and is involved in related
housing and commercial sites, is being taken over by Yattendon Investment
Trust, the Iliffe family's private company.
The recommended cash offer of 180p a share, announced after the market
closed Friday, values Marina at Pounds 31.2m. A full loan note alternative
will be available. Marina's share price was unchanged at 98p.
Yattendon, where Mr Robert Iliffe is chairman, had built up a 24.5 per cent
stake prior to the deal. It has acceptances for another 15 per cent.
Marina incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.3m in the half year to September
30.
Mr Philip Mason, the managing director, said it would have taken some time
to restore a realistic level of earnings and to return to paying a dividend.
Marina's net debt was about Pounds 50m, compared with net assets in March of
Pounds 118.5m.
