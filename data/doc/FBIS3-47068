  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- Japanese shipbuilders are 
worried that the capacity expansion by South Korean shipbuilders 
could spark a global discount race for new orders, industry 
sources said Monday [10 January]. 
  The sources said the Japanese industry plans to raise the 
issue at high-level negotiations in Tokyo in March with its 
South Korean officials. 
  They said the South Korea's Hyundai group conglomerate plans 
to complete a new facility for construction of large-sized oil 
tankers by 1995. 
  Samsung, another industrial giant, reportedly is set to 
start 
construction of a large-scale dockyard this month, they said. 
  South Korean shipbuilders apparently are trying to 
strengthen 
their position as the world's leading shipbuilding nation by 
capitalizing on a slump in the Japanese shipbuilding industry 
resulting from the yen's appreciation, they said. 
  The South Korean shipbuilding industry received a record 
high 
of new shipbuilding orders aggregating 9.52 million gross tons 
in 1993, replacing Japan as the world's leading shipbuilder for 
the first time. 
  The sources said that Japanese shipbuilders have refrained 
from expanding their production capacity because of a global 
surplus.
