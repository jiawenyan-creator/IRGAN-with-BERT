Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), that the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget
approval for extensions on the following previously approved rules and forms:

Rule 17Ad15 requires transfer agents to establish written standards for the acceptance or rejection of guarantees
of securities transfers from eligible guarantor institutions. There are approximately 800 registered transfer
agents subject to the rule's recordkeeping requirements. The average burden for each transfer agent is approximately
40 hours annually, for a total annual burden of 32,000 hours.

Rule 17f1(b) requires reporting institutions to register with the Commission or its designee to participate
in the Lost and Stolen Securities Program. Approximately 600 respondents incur an average of one-half burden hour
annually to comply with this rule, for a total annual burden of 300 hours.

Rule 17f1(c) and Form X17F1A require reporting institutions to report lost, stolen, missing,
and counterfeit securities to a centralized database. Approximately 23,000 reporting institutions file approximately
667,000 Forms X17F1A. The Commission estimates that the average burden for each form is 5 minutes, resulting
in a total annual burden of 55,583 hours.

Rules 17h1T and 17h2T impose reporting and recordkeeping requirements on broker-dealers that are
associated with other entities, other than natural persons. Approximately 250 broker-dealers are subject to the
rules. It is estimated that the average burden for each firm is approximately 14 hours annually, or a cumulative burden
of 3,500 hours.

Direct general comments to the Desk Officer for the Securities and Exchange Commission at the address below. Direct
any comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated average burden hours for compliance with the Commission rules
and forms to David T. Copenhafer, Acting Director, Office of Information Technology, Securities and Exchange Commission,
450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549 and Desk Officer for Securities and Exchange Commission, Project
Numbers 32350409, 32350032, 32350037, and 32350410, Office of Management and Budget,
Room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20503.
