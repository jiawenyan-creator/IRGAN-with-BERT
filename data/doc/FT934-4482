FT  03 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Hanson's house sale
The alchemy which allowed Hanson to remain burdened with debt and yet
receive interest income is waning. Lower interest receivable in yesterday's
figures is the prelude to a nasty reversal next year, as the assumption of
Quantum's debt and falling income on sterling deposits start to bite.
Without action the interest bill will rise by around Pounds 275m. The need
for disposals to pay down debt suddenly looks more urgent.
Floating house building interests in the UK and US makes good sense.
Housebuilders generate little cash even on the upswing, since profits are
generally ploughed back into land. The prospectus will tell whether Hanson
has been reinvesting in this virtuous manner since it acquired Beazer Homes
in 1991. The size of the land bank will determine the final price. While
stock markets are taking a rosy view of recovery, though, Hanson will raise
more from flotation than trade sales, though the disposals should meet
Hanson's Pounds 500m existing overall target.
How much more is required depends on the strength of recovery. Even if
profits rise modestly from here, utilisation of provisions set up against
Beazer and Peabody - and the Pounds 540m cash cost of the dividend - will
leave little scope for debt reduction. That might explain the decision not
to raise the pay-out yesterday. The 5 per cent fall in the shares is similar
to the treatment meted out to BOC last month for taking the same decision.
Hanson's status as a yield stock cuts both ways.
