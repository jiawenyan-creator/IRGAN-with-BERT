SUIT BLAMES 2 DEATHS ON RACISM BY FIRE CHIEF 
Blacks in a small Georgia town have filed a lawsuit in federal court charging 
their local fire chief and several firefighters, who they allege are members of 
the Ku Klux Klan, were responsible for the deaths of two black children. 
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed Thursday, who include the parents of the two 
children and local black leaders in the town of Blakely, allege their fire 
department's response time is much slower to fires in black neighborhoods than 
to those in white neighborhoods.
