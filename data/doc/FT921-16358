FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 122m provisions force FNFC to loss
of Pounds 33.7m
FIRST NATIONAL Finance Corporation, the troubled consumer finance and
commercial banking group, plunged to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 33.7m in the
year to October 31 after making provisions of Pounds 122m against bad debts
on second mortgages and other consumer and commercial lending. The loss
compared with a taxable profit of Pounds 36.4m in 1990.
There is no final dividend on the ordinary shares (8.5p). FNFC also passed
the interim dividend and any decision about restoring dividend payments is
unlikely to be taken until later this year.
Losses came to 13.4p per share (earnings 18.3p) and net assets per share
were 113p, down from 125p.
The total stock of FNFC's provisions now stands at Pounds 160m or about 10
per cent of its total loan book.
Mr Richard Langdon, chairman, said yesterday: 'The year has seen a depressed
property market, which has affected all aspects of our business as most
others have found who are engaged in lending money on property security.'
During the year, FNFC sold Pounds 206m of its loans to two continental banks
to boost its capital resources.
The sale was intended to reassure shareholders after the group's shares
tumbled from 104p in early October to 54p in three days.
Mr Langdon said that the group would have been all right even without the
sale of managed assets.
Yesterday the group's shares rose 7p in fairly active trading to close at
37p, after the market was encouraged by remarks from Mr Langdon of signs of
a fall in default levels and an expected recovery in the second half of the
year.
Total lending at the year-end was Pounds 1.65bn, of which Pounds 1.3bn was
consumer loans and Pounds 350m commercial. During 1991 FNFC did Pounds 430m
of new business of which Pounds 380m was consumer finance. There was a net
reduction of Pounds 32m in arrears during the autumn.
Group turnover, excluding banking business, totalled Pounds 58.3m (Pounds
59m).
There was a tax credit of Pounds 12.3m (charge Pounds 6.25m).
Only 250 of the group's 300,000 personal customers had their homes
repossessed by the group during the year, though this probably understates
the true extent of its clients' distress as most lending is on a second
mortgage basis.
Mr Langdon, who will be 73 in June, plans to retire after seven years as
FNFC chairman after the group's annual meeting in late February.
He will be succeeded by Mr Martin Mays-Smith, a former director of Kleinwort
Benson who is also chairman of Norwich &amp; Peterborough Building Society.
