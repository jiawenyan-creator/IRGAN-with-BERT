FT  18 AUG 94 / Observer: Frank discussions
The Washington rumour mills have been working overtime discussing which
members of the US Treasury team would be thrown to the wolves as a result of
the Whitewater affair. However, one official who should still be standing
when the dust settles is Frank Newman, 52, BankAmerica's former chief
financial officer.
Newman, the softly spoken undersecretary for domestic finance, is tipped to
take over from Roger Altman as number two to Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury
secretary. The other undersecretary, Larry Summers, has shown little
interest in the banking and regulatory issues that tend to take up much of
the deputy's time, and is expected to stay on the international affairs
beat.
There has been gossip that one of the White House's top economics officials,
such as Bo Cutter, who spearheads the foreign trade team, might be moved
across the road to Treasury. But Bentsen may well feel that another channel
of communication to the White House is the last thing he needs at the
moment. Newman earned his spurs helping nurse BankAmerica back to health in
the 1980s. Restoring faith in the US Treasury may test his skills to their
limit.
