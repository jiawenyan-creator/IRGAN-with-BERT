FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Enso-Gutzeit buys stake in
Veitsiluoto
Enso-Gutzeit said last night that it was strengthening its operations in the
Finnish pulp and paper sector by buying a 35 per cent stake in Veitsiluoto,
a state-owned forestry company, for FM1.5bn (Dollars 324m).
The move will make Enso one of Europe's leading producers of fine papers and
newsprint.
The government retains a majority stake in Veitsiluoto but has given Enso an
option to buy the holding if it decides to sell.
Mr Matti Vuoria, secretary-general of Finland's Ministry of Trade and
Industry, said Enso had defeated a rival bid from Metsa-Serla, one of its
domestic rivals, because it had made 'a clearly better offer'.
Enso will pay FM1bn directly to the state and use the remaining FM500m to
strengthen Veitsiluoto's equity. The government holds 33.7 per cent of the
capital and 52.1 per cent of the votes in Enso.
The sale is politically sensitive because Veitsiluoto's operating units are
based in the north of Finland and are important for local employment. Enso
has undertaken to study the feasibility of making a big investment at Oulu,
where Veitsiluoto has recently commissioned a new fine-paper machine.
Veitsiluoto made a FM150m loss after financial items in 1993 on turnover of
FM4.82bn.
Enso yesterday reported a FM872m profit after financial items for the first
eight months, compared with a FM186m profit in the same 1993 period. Sales
advanced to FM11.3bn from FM10.2bn.
Mr Jukka Harmala, chief executive, said the improving trend would continue
in the final four months, giving the group a 'much better' full-year profit
than last year's FM406m. 'Prices for paperboard and for standard and
speciality newsprint will be raised during the final four months,' he said.
The group announced FM650m in new investments. The biggest project, worth
FM400m, involves the construction of a pulp plant and process water
treatment plant.
