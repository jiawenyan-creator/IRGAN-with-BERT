MARCOSES USED 'JANE AND JOHN' PSEUDONYMS, WITNESS TESTIFIES 
A witness at the fraud trial of Imelda Marcos testified today she removed 
documents from the former Philippines first lady's palace that revealed Marcos 
and her husband kept Swiss bank accounts registered under false names. 
The witness, Dr. Angelita Reyes, said she went to the Malacanang Palace in 
February, 1986 -- shortly after Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his 
wife fled the "People Power" revolution that elevated Corazon Aquino to the 
presidency -- and rifled through some of the papers the couple left behind. 
Among the documents Reyes said she found were signature cards indicating the 
Marcoses had at least two Swiss bank accounts under the pseudonyms "John Lewis" 
and "Jane Ryan." 
Imelda Marcos, 60, is on trial for allegedly plotting with her late husband to 
divert money stolen from the Philippines treasury into real estate and art 
investments in Manhattan and around the world.
