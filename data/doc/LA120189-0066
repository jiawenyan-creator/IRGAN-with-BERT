COURT RULES AGAINST BUS DRUG SEARCHES 
A divided Florida Supreme Court declared random drug searches of commercial 
buses unconstitutional, saying the practice invited comparisons to Nazi Germany 
and communist countries. The court, in a 4-3 decision that overturned six drug 
convictions, said the practice violated state and federal constitutional 
protections against unlawful search and seizure, even though the goal -- 
stopping the flow of illegal drugs -- was admirable. "The intrusion upon 
privacy rights caused by the Broward County policy is too great for a democracy 
to sustain," Justice Rosemary Barkett wrote in the majority opinion.
