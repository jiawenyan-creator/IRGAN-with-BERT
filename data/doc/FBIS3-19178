<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by announcer </F>
Franz-Olivier Giesbert in the studio -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Giesbert] Edouard Balladur 
announced yesterday in Bosnia that [Defense Minister] Francois 
Leotard and you will make proposals to render air response 
effective. What does that mean? 
  [Juppe] It means that the situation today is not 
satisfactory. Both the legal apparatus -- that is the UN 
Security Council resolutions -- and the operational apparatus -- 
that is NATO forces, planes in particular -- are ready. 
  [Giesbert] The problem is timing, then, the 60-minute gap, 
more or less, between the moment when the decision to respond is 
made and the moment when it is actually put into effect. 
  [Juppe] Yes it is, maybe a little bit more than that. Timing 
is one problem but the desire is another. It seems that those 
in charge on the ground, who represent the UN secretary general, 
are not ready to use force whenever necessary. But it is 
necessary. In spite of last month's developments in the war in 
the former Yugoslavia, things are still very confused on the 
ground and dangerous -- as we unfortunately saw in the case of 
the 19th French soldier to be killed. The task we are carrying 
out there, in the former Yugoslavia. [sentence as heard] We 
must be faster and we must be more determined to use force 
whenever it is necessary. 
  [Giesbert] Today the initiative you have taken with regard 
to 
the former Yugoslavia has not really been very successful. Are 
you not a little frustrated? It seems that all this will 
eventually end up with a Serb victory. They control 70 percent 
of the land and they will return only what they want to return. 
  [Juppe] This is absolutely untrue. All the peace plans which 
have been prepared -- including the efforts we are making now -- 
have stipulated that the Serbs will have to withdraw and will be 
able to occupy 49 percent of the territory at most. This is 
what was said in the European Union plan. Why should I be 
frustrated? As I told you, we were at a turning point one month 
ago. Sarajevo is now coming back to life. Croats and Muslims 
are holding talks and making progress. It is true that in some 
places, in Bihac in particular, tension is still running high. 
This is why we should have two goals: We should be much 
stricter and much faster. I do not want to repeat what I think 
of the use of force. Second, I think we should try to stick the 
pieces of the diplomatic process together. Today, negotiations 
are being held in many places. We should all sit around a table 
again: Russians, Americans, and Europeans. If the three parties 
involved refuse to sit at that table, we will not really have a 
global solution. [passage omitted]
