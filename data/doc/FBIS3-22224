  [Text] Environment Minister Andres Tarand met a delegation 
of the ``Greenpeace'' environment protection organisation 
yesterday. Heads of the ``Greenpeace'' hazardous waste group 
Kevin Stairs and the Baltic Sea group Rune Leithe-Eriksen 
attempted to convince the minister to adopt stricter measures 
against import of hazardous waste. 
  Estonia has joined the Basel convention on the transport of 
hazardous waste and its national requirements are even stricter 
than those of the convention. But Estonia has been opposing a 
total ban, which would prevent import of any materials. Tarand 
pointed out that the Tallinn Water Treatment Plant uses certain 
titanium waste which comes under the intended ``Greenpeace'' 
ban. The Estonian Green Movement intends to hold a news 
conference today to express its opinion.
