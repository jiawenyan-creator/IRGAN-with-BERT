RALPHS' BONDS DEPRESSED BY CAMPEAU FEARS 
Investors are still cool to the junk bonds of Ralphs Grocery Co., even as a 
growing chorus of analysts are expressing confidence in the supermarket chain. 
Concerns were raised by the Chapter 11 bankruptcy court filing Jan. 15 by two 
of Ralphs' sister companies in the troubled Campeau Corp. organization, 
Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores. 
Even though Ralphs was not included in the bankruptcy case and is considered in 
relatively good financial shape, the company's bonds have fallen on worries 
that the chain will be dragged into the Campeau morass. 
The bonds, which traded as high as $97 per $100 in face value in mid-January, 
have moved down into the mid-$70s during the past two weeks and posted a 
closing bid of $74.50 on Friday. 
Worried investors have pointed to the possibility that Compton-based Ralphs 
will face big tax bills if the Internal Revenue Service demands payment from 
Campeau for $350 million in deferred taxes. Another concern stems from the 
deferred gains taxes of more than $200 million that could be triggered if 
either of the big investors with claims on Ralphs' assets -- Olympia &amp; York 
Developments or Ohio real estate developer Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. -- take over 
the chain. 
Analysts and company officials, however, say there is no more than a remote 
chance that Ralphs will be hit by either of those problems. 
Sheila O'Connell, an analyst with the Duff &amp; Phelps investment firm in 
Chicago, said the Ralphs bonds have been hurt by the overall weakness in the 
junk bond market, too. She predicted that Ralphs bond prices would stay 
depressed until the junk bond market improves or the company can provide 
further assurances to investors.
