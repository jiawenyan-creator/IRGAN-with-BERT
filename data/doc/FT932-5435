FT  03 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Property stocks advance
THE BURGEONING appetite among investors for property shares was further
whetted yesterday when British Land unveiled a partnership with Mr George
Soros, the US investment specialist, sending property shares soaring and
leading the London market sharply higher. Almost overshadowed by the new
joint venture were British Land's results, described by one analyst as
'scintillating', as well as its Pounds 132m 4-for-17 rights issue.
British Land shares galloped forward on news of the Soros deal announced at
the opening of the session, which some institutions underweighted in
property stocks took as a signal that the recovery in the property market
had been duly sanctioned. But dealers said that the large trading volumes of
some leading stocks masked a series of agency crosses. Marketmakers were
also caught out by the developments and stock shortages underpinned some of
the rises.
While many analysts continued to caution over embracing the sector
wholesale, arguing that quality differentials among the long-depressed
stocks were highly significant, yesterday's rises were indiscriminate.
British Land jumped 46 to 344p - its highest level for three years - on
turnover of 4.5m. Hammerson, long considered a potential target for British
Land, was immediately thrown back into the bid limelight, its shares
climbing 11 to 349p. Elsewhere, Land Securities surged 30 to 583p, Brixton
Estates 20 to 218p, while the second liners also caught the mood and forged
ahead strongly. Estate agent Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith, in which the
British Land chairman has an 11 per cent stake, jumped 8 to 42p.
The Soros move into the UK commercial property market, via the link with
British Land, triggered a strong upsurge in bank stocks. Barclays, believed
to have the largest exposure to commercial property in the UK, jumped 11 to
467p with a substantial 8.9m shares changing hands, the heaviest
single-day's turnover for some weeks.
