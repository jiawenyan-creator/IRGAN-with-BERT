GRECO-U.S. TALKS RESUME 
Greece and the United States on Monday began their 16th round of talks on the 
future of U.S. military installations in Greece, officials said. At stake are 
the future of four major U.S. military bases and about 20 smaller 
installations, which have functioned on Greek soil under a five-year agreement 
that expired in December.
