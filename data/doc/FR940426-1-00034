 

III. Implementation of Exchange Act Provisions in the Context of 
Securities Offerings


Securities offerings involve risk and uncertainty.

20

 The Commission has recognized that the pricing of an offering is not an exact science and that regulation of the market
activities of parties with an interest in the outcome of an offering presents ``intensely practical problem(s).''

21

 From its earliest days, the Commission and its staff have been called upon to implement the antimanipulation provisions
of the Exchange Act in the context of securities offerings.

22

 Sections 9(a)(2) and 15(c)(1) were interpreted to require a broad prohibition of trading during a distribution by
persons interested in the distribution.

IV. The Trading Practices Rules 


A. 1955 Rulemaking 


Rules 10b6, 10b7, and 10b8 were proposed for comment in May 1954,

24

 reproposed in April 1955,

25

 and adopted in July 1955.

26

 From the outset, the Trading Practices Rules reflected the framework established by the Commission during the preceding
twenty years interpreting section 9(a)'s prohibitions on manipulative conduct, and consist of a broad trading prohibition
with exceptions thereto. In the following four decades, the Commission and staff have administered the Trading Practices
Rules and related antimanipulation rules within this framework.
