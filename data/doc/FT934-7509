FT  19 NOV 93 / Technology: Bringing home the Beaujolais Nouveau - Worth
Watching
US military technology combined with British computer expertise helped Lotus
cars bring home the Beaujolais this week.
As the race got under way to bring the Beaujolais Nouveau from Lacernas,
north of Lyon, to Margate on the UK's south coast, one of the 55 cars
carried a notebook PC which had the ability to plug into US military
satellites to help navigate.
The Lotus Esprit S4 was equipped with a Carrera Technology notebook PC with
navigation software from Nextbase. Trimble Navigation provided the plug-in
equipment to enable the Lotus navigator to pinpoint the car's position on
the map of France to within 100m. Carrera Technology: UK, 071 830 0486.
