FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Marston Thompson up 21%
Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the regional brewer, raised first half profits
by 21 per cent to Pounds 11.5m as reciprocal trading agreements with
national brewers contributed to a 4 per cent increase in beer volumes.
Mr Michael Hurdle, chairman, said he was optimistic about a satisfactory
outcome for the year though the profit increase in the second half was
likely to be lower.
'With few signs of an upturn in the economy, conditions in the brewing
industry remain difficult and continue to become increasingly competitive,'
he added.
Earnings per share during the six months to September 25, grew 19 per cent
to 8.71p (7.3p) and the interim dividend is raised from 1.45p to 1.6p.
Operating profit rose from Pounds 9.58m to Pounds 11.8m on turnover ahead 11
per cent at Pounds 70.1m (Pounds 63.2m).
Beer volume sales outside the company's own pubs increased by 14 per cent
with benefits from the reciprocal agreements with national brewers, growing
sales of canned draught Pedigree, and a 30 per cent rise in marketing
expenditure.
'The increase in external sales is a highly encouraging result in an area
that we see as having further growth potential,' Mr Hurdle said.
Sales in Marston's own estate declined 3.4 per cent. The managed houses
showed good growth - liquor sales 14 per cent ahead, food sales 16 per cent
higher and retail trading profits growing 25 per cent - but trading
conditions remained difficult for some tenanted pubs.
A long period of decline in volume sales to free houses was arrested and
sales were ahead at the half year. Free trade loans were Pounds 500,000
higher but a Pounds 700,000 provision was also made for bad debts.
Capital expenditure in the first half totalled Pounds 21.8m, including
Pounds 12.7m on pub acquisitions.
