METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BONNER SWORN IN AS HEAD OF FEDERAL DRUG 
AGENCY 
Robert C. Bonner, who was a federal judge and U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, on 
Thursday was sworn into office as head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in 
Washington. 
Reminding those at the ceremony that the drug crisis has been building for more 
than 20 years, Bonner said, "It is going to take at least five years, and 
perhaps more, of steady effort and involvement by all segments of our society 
to work our way out of it." 
Bonner took the oath of office from Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia before 
about 300 people gathered at DEA headquarters. 
Bonner, 48, had been a U.S. district judge since June 16, 1989. Before that, he 
was the U.S. attorney for five years. He was assistant U.S. attorney in Los 
Angeles from 1971 to 1975. 
President Bush nominated Bonner to succeed John C. Lawn, who retired in March 
after five years at the DEA's helm. The Senate approved the nomination by voice 
vote on July 27.
