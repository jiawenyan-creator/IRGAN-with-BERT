  [Text] TALLINN, Apr 13, BNS -- Maj. Aare Evisalu, chief of 
control center, and Maj. Edgar Aaro, head of service department 
of the Estonian border guard, met today with Gen. Viktor 
Kostenko, commander of Russian border guard's Pskov unit, to 
discuss the strengthening of border regime on the temporary 
borderline between the two countries and the issue of illegal 
immigrants, including Kurds. 
  Evisalu told BNS the two parties agreed in principle on 
simplifying border crossing regulations for the people living on 
both sides of the southeast Estonian border. 
  "We didn't sign any documents, since the decision officially 
rests with the Estonian and the Russian governments," Evisalu 
said. 
  Officials from the Narva cordon of the Estonian border guard 
and Russia's Ivangorod cordon continue tomorrow talks to resolve 
the fate of the Kurds detained in Estonia. 
  "Kostenko agreed that the return of the Kurds to Russia 
should be solved at border guard, not foreign ministry, level," 
the Estonian officer said. 
  Today's meeting also touched on the April 1 incident when 
two 
unidentified Russian-speaking assailants killed one and wounded 
two Russian border guards near the Pechory railway station on 
the Russian side of the border. 
  "I asked Kostenko about his opinion on an article in the 
April 5 issue of the Russian IZVESTIA newspaper, which claimed 
that the assailants came from and fled to Estonia," Evisalu told 
BNS. "Kostenko said it was one of the (Russian side's) working 
hypotheses, which facts haven't corroborated so far, and that 
the article was a piece of journalistic fantasy."
