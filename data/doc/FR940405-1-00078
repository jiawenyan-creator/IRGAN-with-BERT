1Risks are expressed as number of cases per 1,000 workers at risk.

2The annual risk is estimated assuming that the prevalence of air-conditioned office buildings in the U.S. is 70 percent.

3Assumes 45 years of occupational exposure and is calculated as 1-(1-p

45

, where p is the annual risk.

4Defined as headaches that either require medical attention or restrict activity.

5Defined as runny nose, stuffy nose, dry/irritated throat and dry/irritated/itchy eyes and being severe enough
to either require medical attention or restrict activity.
