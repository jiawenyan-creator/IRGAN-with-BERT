Achievements of Institute 11 Pass Appraisal''] 
  [Summary] Six infrared (IR) technology achievements of 
MEI's Institute 11 recently passed formal appraisal. These 
achievements include the following: development of 160-element 
and 60-element long-wavelength linear-array photoconductive 
HgCdTe IR detectors, development of a 128-element InSb CID 
[charge-injection device] linear focal plane array (FPA), 
research on 60-element high-power throttling cooler technology, 
and research on 60-element and 32-element microdewars. The two 
HgCdTe IR detectors meet late-80s international standards (main 
performance indicators), while the InSb CID FPA is at the 
domestic state-of-the-art. The 60-element high-power throttling 
cooler technology study is on a par with advanced foreign 
standards and includes the first domestic use of an 
Ar-N[.sub]2[/] gas mixture in a cryocooler. Finally, all 
technical indicators for the all-metallic-structure 60-element 
and 32-element microdewars meet or exceed contract requirements; 
the 32-element model is designed to be used interchangeably with 
the igF5.2 self-regulating throttling cryocooler.
