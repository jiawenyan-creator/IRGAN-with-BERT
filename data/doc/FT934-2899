FT  11 DEC 93 / Ban on rice imports remains for now
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, has been forced to
postpone for a second time an official decision on lifting the ban on rice
imports, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Mr Hosokawa had intended to make an announcement yesterday, but was forced
to reschedule because of opposition from the socialist party, a member of
the seven-party coalition.
Japan is expected to agree to accept limited imports for six years and then
introduce tariffs.
