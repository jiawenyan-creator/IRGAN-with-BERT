THE SIDELINES; 
EX-SOONERS JAILED IN DRUG CASE 
A federal judge has sent two former University of Oklahoma athletes to prison 
for helping former Sooners quarterback Charles Thompson sell cocaine. 
U.S. District Judge Ralph Thompson sentenced former football player John Green, 
25, of Detroit to 16 months and former Sooner track runner Lamont Harris of 
Dallas to 18 months. 
The judge also ordered Monday that the two be supervised for three years after 
release and receive drug treatment. 
Thompson, serving time in a Texas federal prison after pleading guilty in 
April, 1989, to a cocaine conspiracy charge, testified during the two 
ex-Sooners' trial that he arranged the sale of 17 grams of cocaine on behalf of 
Green and Harris.
