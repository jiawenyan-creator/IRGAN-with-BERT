  [Text] On the night of 24 January, 2,000 people and 600 
ANKI [National Army of Independent Cambodia] soldiers gathered 
in Samraong District of Oddar Meanchey Province. They were 
angry with [FUNCINPEC General] Nhoek Bunchhai, other ANKI 
commanders, puppet commanders Prum Samen, Long Sopheap, and Eng 
Sopheap, commanders of special units Kanti, Di, and Chan, and 
the other evil commanders who have plundered their salaries and 
people's rice and oppressed and forcibly recruited people to 
fight and die on their behalf. The people and soldiers jointly 
attacked these elements who were enjoying their drinking, 
killing or wounding a number of them. Nhoek Bunchhai fled from 
the scene. The people are chasing him. 
  At the same time, the ANKI soldiers deserted the battlefield 
and stopped fighting because they have not been paid, had no 
rice nor medicine, and did not want to die for nothing. They do 
not want to serve the Vietnamese and Vietnamese puppets any 
more. They would rather go back home to farm and earn a living 
for their families than die for the puppets.
