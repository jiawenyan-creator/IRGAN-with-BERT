large-volume purchase by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which has 
awarded its bid to Maurice J. Sopp &amp; Sons of Huntington Park. 
The Police Department, which uses Chevrolet Impala and Caprice patrol cars, 
plans to use six of the new cars for patrol and three for administrative 
duties, according to a staff report.
