FT  05 MAR 92 / Police teargas Nairobi protestors
Kenyan riot police fired teargas at crowds of stone-throwing demonstrators
in Nairobi yesterday in the second day of protests over the clubbing by
police of women hunger strikers, Reuter reports from Nairobi.
Gangs of youths set ablaze unmarked cars, believed to belong to government
security agencies, and hurled bricks at police around a main bus terminal.
The unrest is the worst confrontation between police and anti-government
demonstrators since President Daniel arap Moi gave way to pressure at home
and abroad last December and said the country would switch to a multi-party
system.
