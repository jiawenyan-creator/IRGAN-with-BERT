  [Text] Minsk, February 15 (TASS) -- The political strike 
scheduled for today failed, as the majority of Minsk enterprises 
are working in a normal regime. The car plant has a day-off due 
to the absence of spares. 
  A rally of participants in a political strike began at 11 
A.M. Today [0800 GMT] on Minsk Nezavisimost Square to attract 
4,000 local residents, much less than it was expected. 
  People's deputies, representatives of parties, movements and 
labor collectives demanded resignation of the current 
authorities, creation of a coalition government and early 
parliament elections. 
  Speakers of the one-hour-long rally, including 
representatives of the Minsk tractor plant and Soligorsk miners, 
criticized the government and the parliament for economic 
crisis, corruption of high places and low wages and salaries. 
An average plant salary is enough to buy several kilos of 
sausages. 
  Then the rally participants moved from the government 
building to the Supreme Soviet to hand over their demands to 
parliament leaders. 
  A proposal on universal elections of the Belarussian 
president will be put forward at a parliament session to begin 
in a week, parliament speaker Mechyslaw Hryb told a meeting with 
representatives of the strikers. If the parliament supports the 
proposal the elections can be held in late May-June. It will 
also be necessary to adopt a new Belarusian constitution, as the 
current fundamental law does not provide for presidency. 
  The Belarusian leader said he is ready to initiate a 
republican referendum on presidential rule. 
  A meeting of the Supreme Soviet Presidium will consider 
demands of the strikers on Thursday. "If these demands are an 
ultimatum, I do not accept ultimatums," said Hryb.
