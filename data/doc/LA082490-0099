SAN DIEGO SAILORS IN TITLE CHASE 
Only one point separates David Houser of the Coronado Yacht Club, Mike Hare of 
Houston and Brett Davis of St. Petersburg, Fla., going into today's final race 
of the single-handed Laser class in the U.S. Yacht Racing Union/Rolex National 
Junior Championships at Newport Beach. 
Davis started slowly in the five-day, 10-race series but won four consecutive 
races before placing second in the ninth race Thursday. 
With low score winning, Hare is now the leader with 22 points to 22 3/4 for 
Houser and 23 for Davis. 
First place is worth three-quarters of a point, and subsequent places equate to 
their positions. 
Bill Hardesty of the Mission Bay Yacht Club, with crewman Paul Ware, slipped to 
fourth -- their worst finish all week -- in the first of two Flying Junior 
races but won the second to retain first overall with two races remaining 
today. 
Hardesty is 3 1/2 points ahead of second-place Jesse Andrews of the American 
Yacht Club in Rye, N.Y. Third place is 15 1/2 points behind Andrews. 
Scott Elting of Houston took over the lead in the Etchells 22 fleet when Jory 
Twist of the host Newport Harbor Yacht Club was disqualified for a premature 
start in Thursday's first race. Manning Montagnet of Pass Christian YC in 
Mississippi also started early but won the next race, with Twist second. 
Twist dropped to third overall, four points behind Elting, but still has a 
chance to win with his performance in today's two races under the scoring 
system. 
The fleets enjoyed their strongest wind conditions of the week, 10 to 15 knots. 
Class winners here will be members of the U.S. junior national team. BOB DUKE
