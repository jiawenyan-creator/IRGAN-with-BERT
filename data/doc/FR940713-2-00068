ACTION:

 Notice to extend FMR public comment period.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Notice advises the public that HUD is extending the public comment period for the FMRs until October 14, 1994 in
order to give PHAs in FMR areas with small rental housing inventories the opportunity to use the new survey guide HUD
has recently developed.


HUD is also announcing in this Notice that there will be two final FMR publications again this year. The first publication
will make the proposed FMRs for all areas effective on October 1, 1994. The second publication, to be issued late in
the year, will announce revised final FMRs for the areas for which HUD has made a determination that the rental housing
surveys submitted provided a sufficient basis for such revision.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 8(c)(1) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 requires the Secretary to publish FMRs periodically, but
not less frequently than annually, to be effective on October 1 of each year. On June 23, 1994, HUD published the proposed
Fiscal Year (FY) 1995 FMRs with a 60-day public comment period to August 22, 1994.


With this Notice, HUD is extending the public comment period until October 14, 1994 to ensure that PHAs and other interested
parties who wish to use the new rental housing survey guide will have sufficient time to do so.
The guide is intended for PHAs administering Section 8 programs in small FMR areas, for whom the formal Random Digit
Dialing (RDD) methodology would not be cost effective. It enables a PHA to carry out a rental housing survey by itself,
for a fraction of the cost of a formal RDD. The guide provides instruction on how to choose the best, most cost-effective
means of surveying the rental housing stock in the FMR area. It describes survey options and provides specific advice
and guidelines for conducting valid surveys and submitting comments in accordance with statistical requirements.
The simplified methods presented in this guide offer the least costly means of obtaining valid FMR estimates for public
housing agencies that manage under 500 Section 8 units in FMR areas with under 5,000 total rental units. Even the smallest
PHAs might wish to review this guide for its suggestions on how to develop representative samples and conduct statistically
acceptable surveys.
HUD is not mandating use of the new guide for PHAs in small FMR areas or use of the RDD method for larger areas. However,
it is strongly urged that commenters consider these approaches because they are much more likely to result in an end
product that is acceptable to HUD.
Copies of the new survey guide are available from HUD USER, at (800) 2452691. Questions concerning the guide
may be directed to HUD field office economists.
