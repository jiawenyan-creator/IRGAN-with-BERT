FT  02 JUN 92 / Beregovoy survives vote by a whisker
FRANCE'S two-month-old government narrowly survived a no-confidence motion
yesterday when the opposition, unusually backed by the Communists, fell just
three votes short of toppling Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister,
Reuter reports from Paris.
The centre-right opposition called the motion against the minority Socialist
government in protest at European Community agriculture policy reforms, but
also used it to voice wider opposition to France's integration with the rest
of Europe.
Pro-European centrist deputies, including Mr Raymond Barre, a former prime
minister, did not vote for the motion which only just failed to gain the 289
votes needed for a majority in the 576-seat national assembly.
