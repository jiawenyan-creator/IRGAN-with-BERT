RAIDERS: IT'S AS IF THEY NEVER LEFT; 
MOVES: ONCE AGAIN, THE INERTIA OF EIGHT YEARS IN LOS ANGELES OVERCOMES DAVIS' 
IMPETUS TO RELOCATE. 
To those cities and politicians who have wheeled and dealed, dreamed and 
schemed, comes this latest bulletin: Owner Al Davis signed a contract Tuesday 
to keep the Raiders in Los Angeles, ending a three-year bidding war that has 
come full circle and left in its wake the ruination of careers, dreams and -- 
in the case of Irwindale -- just plain ruins. 
Xavier Hermosillo, come on out of that Irwindale gravel pit. You'll always have 
the summer of 1987, when you landed the deal to bring the Raiders to your cozy 
little town by the freeway. 
Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson, sorry that fourth term is doomed. Just remember 
how big you were for those few moments in March, when the prodigal Al Davis 
agreed to come home. 
Dear Sacramento, one year ago you were really looking smart. You still are. And 
so was that $50 million you offered those Raiders. 
Finally, to Tom never-give-up-hope Bradley: Was Tuesday as sweet as Jan. 18, 
1980, when it was disclosed that the Raiders would replace the Rams at the 
Coliseum? 
Davis and Spectacor Management Group, the private firm that manages the Los 
Angeles Coliseum, agreed Monday to a 20-year lease in exchange for a privately 
financed, $145-million renovation of the Coliseum. This includes stadium 
improvements the Raiders claimed they were promised when they moved here from 
Oakland in 1982. 
In addition, it is said the Raiders will receive $32 million in advance cash 
payments from Spectacor and forgiveness of a $10-million debt the team owes the 
Coliseum Commission. 
But with all the fanfare, there is still a catch: The contract could be void in 
a few years if Spectacor does not produce an environmental impact report 
allowing the multimillion dollar renovation of the Coliseum and raise the 
private financing to ,pay for it. 
Plans to renovate the 67-year-old Coliseum call for retention of the historic 
existing exterior walls. The interior, however, will be drastically altered to 
include the following: 
 -- A reduction in stadium capacity from 92,500 seats to 70,000 for Raider 
games and 85,000 for USC games. Davis said Tuesday he actually wants only 
65,000 seats. 
 -- Construction of as many as 250 luxury boxes at mid-level of the stadium and 
15,000 club seats. 
The environmental impact report is expected to take a year. Reconstruction 
would begin after the 1991 Raider and USC seasons. During the 1992 season, both 
USC and the Raiders will have to play elsewhere. Speculation is the Raiders 
will play at Dodger Stadium and USC at Anaheim Stadium. 
The longstanding dispute between the Raiders and the Coliseum was resolved last 
week when the commission, which no longer runs the facility, voted to drop its 
$58-million breach of contract suit against the Raiders if the team signed an 
agreement to stay. 
That suit was filed after the Raiders announced in August of 1987 that they 
intended to move to Irwindale, where officials offered to build a stadium in a 
gravel pit. But the controversy created by Davis and his team started much 
earlier. 
Here's Davis and his Raiders recording history in The Times headlines: 
 Raiders Defy League, Court, Head for L.A. (March 2, 1980) -- Not yet. The City 
of Oakland claimed eminent domain and the state Supreme Court sent the trial to 
Superior Court. A court order blocked the Raider move, and the team played in 
Oakland through the 1981 season. 
 Rozelle Antitrust Theory: From Here to Antiquity (Aug. 19, 1982) -- A federal 
court jury in May issued a $49-million judgment in antitrust damages against

Gouging (Aug. 27, 1982) -- Even before the first game, fans were on Al Davis.

showed up Aug. 29, 1982 for the Raiders' first home game, an exhibition victory 
over the Green Bay Packers. After the game, Lyle Alzado said: "I thought it 
(the fans' reception) was good. It's L.A. Either you like it and understand it, 
or you don't. I like the L.A. people. They're crazy." 
 Raiders to Be Paid $4 Million: Coliseum Board Sees 'Moral Obligation' to Al 
Davis (Feb. 2, 1984) -- Even though the Raiders won the Super Bowl in January, 
at least one county official was prophetic about giving Davis $4 million before 
he signed a final contract: "This could mean that Davis could move the Raiders 
tomorrow, take the $4 million and pay no penalty," said Donavan Main, then the 
principal deputy county counsel. 
It's Official: Davis Signs Contract to Keep Raiders in L.A. (Dec. 9, 1984) --
