FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: Italy in new move to cut costs
of borrowing
ITALY'S treasury has received the go-ahead to issue domestic debt in a
variety of foreign currencies, providing an important new weapon in its
battle to reduce borrowing costs and the budget deficit.
The deficit, expected to be about L155,000bn (Dollars 104.8bn) this year,
represents almost 11 per cent of gross domestic product. Although a variety
of new borrowing instruments have been introduced in the 1990s to extend
maturities and reduce debt servicing costs, the huge accumulated debt
continues to overshadow attempts to cut spending.
The treasury will also be allowed to accept government securities in lieu of
cash from investors buying shares as part of the privatisation programme.
The move should help smooth the way for the government's ambitious asset
sales and help overcome contraints on the domestic stock market.
No details have been given of what type of bonds will be acceptable for
swapping into equity.
