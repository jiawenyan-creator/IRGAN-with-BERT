  [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- Comrade Kim Chong-il, 
supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, replied to a 
letter from Corporal Kim Chol-chin and Private 1st Class Kim 
Kyong-chol of the Korean People's Security Forces, who came back 
after they fell unconscious, caught in a storm, on the West Sea 
of Korea in January and were detained by the enemy. 
  The autographic reply letter says: 
  "The motherland is proud of such fine sons as you. 
  I firmly believe that you will glorify your life in the 
noble 
cause of defending the party and the country, cherishing the 
precious experience you got in the enemy-controlled area. 
  Kim Chong-il." 
  In their letter to Comrade Kim Chong-il the two soldiers 
said 
it was thanks to the rockfirm faith and will instilled in them 
by General Kim Chong-il and to his loving care that they could 
come back to the bosom of the general, at last, winning the 
fight with the enemy. 
  "With the unshakable faith that we are sure to win as long 
as 
you are with us, dear General, we rose up in confrontation with 
the enemy, firmly determined to come back to you, come to you 
even in death, if we could not come alive," they said. 
  They said the enemy tried to appease them with money and 
honeyed words in an effort to take them off from the bosom of 
General Kim Chong-il, but they kept the faith as his soldiers to 
the end and thus were embraced in his bosom again with honor. 
  "When we saw in the enemy-controlled area the enemy tremble 
for fear of you, dear General, our conviction of certain victory 
grew a hundred, nay, a thousand times, the conviction that our 
general is the greatest in the world and we will win as long as 
there is you, General Kim Chong-il, with us," they said. 
  The two soldiers pledged to remain loyal to General Kim 
Chong-il in whatever storm, even though the world may change 
hundreds of times, and become the first bombs of the 5 million 
bombs in safeguarding him.
