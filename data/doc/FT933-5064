FT  06 SEP 93 / Graduate job prospects continue to deteriorate
EMPLOYMENT prospects for new graduates have worsened again, figures released
today show.
The proportion of graduates finding long-term employment by the end of the
year in which they left university fell to 43 per cent last year.
It was the fifth successive annual fall, figures from the Universities'
Statistical Record show. In 1986-87, 60 per cent of graduates found
long-term jobs. The latest figure is lower than the 49.5 per cent reached in
the trough of the last UK recession in 1980-81.
Last year the proportion believed to be totally unemployed, without even
temporary work, rose from 9.4 per cent to 10.6 per cent.
Graduates also shifted away from industry - the destination for 23 per cent,
down from 25 per cent the year before - and towards commerce - up 1
percentage point to 31 per cent.
Employers' organisations, including the Confederation of British Industry,
predict that companies will start to recruit graduates again before economic
recovery is fully under way, and graduate recruiters earlier this summer
detected a 'small but discernible upturn' in demand. This has yet to be
reflected in any figures.
Only 'old' universities, and not the former polytechnics which have become
universities, are included in these figures.
The number of students graduating from education courses fell 2.4 per cent
last year, the Universities Statistical Record shows. All the other subject
groups registered a rise, with an average of 6.3 per cent.
