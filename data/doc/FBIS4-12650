  [Text] Negotiations involving Sudan's warring factions 
today hit a snag when one of the groups refused to be signatory 
to a treaty they were scheduled to endorse. 
  The treaty involves passing a decree to a free passage of 
relief food supplies and humanitarian assistance to the war 
affected areas in southern Sudan. Reliable sources at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs where negotiations are still going 
on, told KTN that two groups, the SPLA [Sudan People's 
Liberation Army] mainstream and Sudanese Government had agreed 
to sign the document but the other faction, SPLM [Sudan People's 
Liberation Movement] declined to be part of it. 
  SPLM alleged that there had been alterations in the treaty, 
thereby demanding that unless the alterations were removed they 
would not be signatories. The negotiations, which were chaired 
by the minister of research, science and applied technology, 
Zachary Onyonka, were also attended by United Nations Operation 
Lifeline Sudan representative and IGADD [Intergovernmental 
Authority on Drought and Development] representatives. By the 
time we went on air negotiations were still going on.
