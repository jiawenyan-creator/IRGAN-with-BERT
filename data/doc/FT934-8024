FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nedcor to expand in Africa
FOLLOWING similar forays into Africa by some of its competitors, Nedcor,
South Africa's fourth largest banking group, has announced a series of
initiatives to increase its presence on the continent.
Nedcor Bank, a subsidiary of Nedcor, has entered into a strategic alliance
with Societe Financiere pour les Pays d'Outre-Mer (SFOM), to combine forces
in Africa.
SFOM, a Swiss-based holding company, has major shareholdings in banks in 14
countries in Africa with a strong presence in West and Central Africa. It is
owned by Banque Nationale de Paris, Dresdner Bank and Banque Bruxelles
Lambert.
Nedcor Bank and SFOM have also agreed, with effect from October 1 1993, to
combine forces in Namibia by merging Namibian Banking Corporation and
Commercial Bank of Namibia.
The merged bank will be jointly managed by the two partners, which hold an
88 per cent stake, and will be known as The Commercial Bank of Namibia. It
will be the third largest bank in Namibia with total assets of R725m
(Dollars 166m).
Nedcor Bank has also agreed to acquire an effective 16 per cent strategic
stake in the Merchant Bank of Central Africa, one of Zimbabwe's premier
banks, in partnership with other major shareholders including SFOM, NM
Rothschild and Hill Samuel.
Nedcor Bank said that, given South Africa's inexperience in the rest of the
continent, it had been decided to forge relationships with other banks that
had greater experience in the region. The group saw its business in Africa
as the provision of bankings services and support to its corporate and
commercial customers doing business in Africa.
