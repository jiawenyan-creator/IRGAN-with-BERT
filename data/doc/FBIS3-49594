  [Text] Sofia, January 11 (BTA) -- Bulgarian Defence 
Minister Valentin Aleksandrov allegedly handed in his 
resignation last Friday [7 January] after a heated argument with 
the president, 24 CHASA says, quoting an "excellently informed 
source." 
  This move was on the agenda of a cabinet meeting yesterday, 
but the minister withdrew his resignation after a long talk with 
the prime minister. Mr. Aleksandrov neither confirmed nor 
denied the press reports of a row between him and President 
Zhelev. According to the press, the delegation of extraordinary 
powers to the president's military office has provoked the 
scandal. The defence minister did not agree to the army being 
commanded by two authorities, 24 CHASA, says, commenting on the 
possible causes of Mr. Aleksandrov's resignation. According to 
observers, the pressure put on Valentin Aleksandrov was intended 
to wear down his resistance to the replacement of General Lyuben 
Petrov, chief of the General Staff of the Army, 24 CHASA adds. 
  "Zhelev Models Military Office in Royal Fashion," the 
Socialists' daily DUMA says in a frontpage headline. The daily 
also writes about differences between the defence minister and 
President Zhelev on the powers of president's military office.
