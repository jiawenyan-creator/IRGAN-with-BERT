FT  03 AUG 94 / Good managers hard to keep
Three-quarters of senior executives of building societies believe that
management capability will be a serious constraint for a significant number
of small societies during the next five years, according to a survey
published today, Alison Smith writes.
While this is a view more strongly held among executives of the largest
societies, more than half of senior executives in small societies - with
assets of less than Pounds 1bn - also admitted that attracting and retaining
enough good managers was a significant obstacle to be overcome. Mr John
Wriglesworth, societies analyst at UBS who compiled the survey with Mortgage
Finance Gazette, said: 'That admission amounts to signing their own death
warrants, and putting themselves up for grabs by large societies.'
The survey shows a bleaker view than five years ago, reflecting growing
competition in retail financial services and the secotor's increasing
complexity. In the earlier survey, just 45 per cent saw management
capability as a serious constraint for small societies.
The latest survey shows disenchantment with estate agency. In 1989, 97 per
cent of executives expected significant numbers of large societies to
acquire estate agents: now only 10 per cent expect them to do so.
