  [Text] The Philippines will be forced to send troops to 
North Korea if war breaks out there. This was revealed by 
Senator Blas Ople, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. He emphasized that the country, being a member of 
the United Nations, should lead in sending troops to North 
Korea. Ople also asked the government to take appropriate 
action to safeguard the estimated 40,000 Filipinos in Korea [as 
heard]. 
  Meanwhile, Senator Rodolfo Biazon, former Armed Forces of 
the 
Philippines chief, hopes the current situation in Korea will not 
result in war.
