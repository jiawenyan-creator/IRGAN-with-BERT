FT  07 FEB 94 / EU strives to open way for new members
European Union foreign ministers meet in Brussels today and tomorrow to
start the final stretch of negotiations aimed at bringing Austria, Sweden,
Finland and Norway into the Union by next January.
This is the main set-piece of a meeting that is expected also to include
consideration of a more robust stance on Bosnia.
For the enlargement deadline to be met, a deal on agricultural and regional
aid subsidies, plus the linked issue of how much the four applicants should
contribute to the EU budget, must be struck before the end of this month.
In addition, Austria wants greater environmental guarantees on EU truck
traffic through its Alpine passes, while Norway is still at odds with the 12
over management of its fisheries resources and Oslo's sanctioning of whale
and seal pup hunting.
The current Greek presidency of the EU has scheduled extra ministerial
meetings with the four for February 21-22 and February 24-28, in what still
looks like an ambitious attempt to conclude the enlargement talks.
'This is a serious attempt to finish the negotiations,' one senior EU
diplomat said, but 'it is perfectly possible that these negotiations will
not come to a conclusion in February.'
The 12, however, have at last endorsed the line taken by European Commission
negotiators on farm subsidies, broadly backing the Brussels approach to
regional aid for the four.
The Commission wants the generally much higher Nordic and Alpine subsidies
to agriculture realigned at EU levels immediately on entry, with the
difference paid as direct compensation to farmers.
All the candidates but Sweden, allied with traditionalists in the powerful
Commission agriculture directorate, prefer the border rebates that were used
to iron out farm subsidy differences until the internal market came into
effect last year.
Ministers are also set to take steps to strengthen relations with eastern
Europe.
