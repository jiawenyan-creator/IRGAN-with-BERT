FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Lowe warns on second six months
LOSSES WERE reduced to Pounds 162,000 at Robert H Lowe in the six months to
April 30, but the company said problems in its childrens' wear division
would affect the second half.
The improvement at the pre-tax level came from sales of Pounds 15.5m (Pounds
15.8m) and compared with a deficit last time of Pounds 396,000.
Interest payable fell to Pounds 624,000 (Pounds 799,000) reflecting reduced
borrowings after last October's rights issue. Losses per share were 0.95p
(8.27p).
Rationalisation measures at the childrens' wear division reflected a sharp
reduction in forward demand.
