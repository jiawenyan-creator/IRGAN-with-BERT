U.S. MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO EL SALVADOR 
The Bush Administration's double standard has never been more odious and 
obvious than by its criticism of El Salvador's leaders for their cover-up and 
failure to prosecute those responsible for the killing of the six Jesuit 
priests. 
In the meantime, this same Administration is doing a "soft shoe" on the arrest 
of a Mexican citizen, apparently by the DEA, in Mexico and his removal to the 
United States, all illegal and in violation of Mexican sovereignty. 
In short, how can we "read my lips" when one talks out of both sides of the 
mouth?
