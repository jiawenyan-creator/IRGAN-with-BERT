Facepiece tests; minimum requirements.


(a) The complete gas mask will be fitted to the faces of persons having varying facial shapes and sizes.
(b) Where the applicant specifies a facepiece size or sizes for the gas mask, together with the approximate measurements
of faces they are designed to fit, the Institute will insure that test subjects suit such facial measurements.
(c) Any gas mask parts which must be removed to perform the facepiece or mouthpiece fit test shall be replaceable without
special tools and without disturbing the facepiece or mouthpiece fit.

in his instructions will be used before each test specified in paragraph (e) of this section, and in 84.125.
(e) (1) Each wearer will enter a chamber containing 100 p.p.m. isoamyl acetate vapor for a half-mask facepiece and
1,000 p.p.m. isoamyl acetate vapor for a full facepiece or mouthpiece.
(2) The facepiece or mouthpiece may be adjusted, if necessary, in the test chamber before starting the tests.
(3) Each wearer will remain in the chamber for 8 minutes while performing the following activities:
(i) Two minutes, nodding and turning head;
(ii) Two minutes, calisthenic arm movements;
(iii) Two minutes, running in place; and
(iv) Two minutes, pumping with a tire pump into a 28 liter (1 cubic foot) container.
