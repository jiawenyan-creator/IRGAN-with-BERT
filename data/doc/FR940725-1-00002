<RINDOCK>RIN 3150AD94 </RINDOCK>


Environmental Review for Renewal of Operating 
Licenses 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Supplemental proposed rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing a supplement to the proposed rule concerning the environmental
review for renewal of operating licenses. The supplement would revise the definition of purpose and need for the proposed
Federal action that will be used in the environmental review of applications for renewal of nuclear power plant operating
licenses. This action was developed in response to public comments on the proposed rule. The redefinition presented
in the supplement to the proposed rule would also affect the identification of alternatives to the proposed action
that will be considered in environmental reviews for license renewal.

 
</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Submit comments by September 8, 1994. Comments received after this date will be considered if it is practical to do
so, but the Commission is able to assure consideration only for comments received on or before this date.

Background 


On September 17, 1991 (56 FR 47016), the NRC published in the Federal Register proposed amendments to its environmental
protection regulations, 10 CFR Part 51, that would establish new requirements for the environmental review of applications
to renew operating licenses for nuclear power plants. Concurrently, the NRC published NUREG1437,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 a draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) that contained the analysis which NRC proposed to codify in
10 CFR Part 51. In commenting on the proposed rule and the draft GEIS, a number of States expressed dissatisfaction
with the treatment of need for generating capacity, alternative energy sources, and certain other issues. They expressed
strong concerns that the proposed rule would intrude adversely on traditional State regulatory authority over these
matters. They expressed concern that designation of need for generating capacity and alternative energy sources
as Category 1

 issues would substantially eliminate public participation, would adversely affect independent State consideration
of these matters, and would inadequately provide for use of current, project specific information.

Category definitions:
Category 1_A generic conclusion on the impact has been reached for all affected nuclear power plants.
Category 2_A generic conclusion on the impact has been reached for all nuclear power plants that fall within defined
bounds.
Category 3_A generic conclusion on the impact was not reached for any nuclear power plant.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission instructed the NRC staff to develop an options paper for responding to these State concerns, to solicit
State views on the options, and to present these options to the Commission. To facilitate discussion of these matters
the NRC staff developed an options paper entitled ``Addressing The Concerns Of States And Others Regarding The Role
Of Need For Generating Capacity, Alternative Energy Sources, Utility Costs, And Cost-Benefit Analysis In NRC Environmental
Reviews For Relicensing Nuclear Power Plants: An NRC Staff Discussion Paper.'' A 

Federal Register

 notice (January 18, 1994; 59 FR 2542) announced the scheduling of three regional workshops and the availability of
the options paper.
