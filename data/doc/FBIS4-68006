Moscow"] 
  [Text] Mariupol -- Mariupol security service staffers have 
caught and exposed a group of foreign citizens who were 
intending to carry out an act of international terrorism in 
Moscow. The "guests" had manufactured an explosive device with 
a large fragmentation radius. 
  In an exclusive interview with a correspondent for the 
newspaper PRIAZOVSKIY RABOCHIY Colonel Dmitriy Chernousenko, 
deputy chief of the Ukrainian security service's administration 
for Donetsk Oblast, said: 
  "The plans of the arrestees included committing an act of 
terrorism in respect of one of the embassies located in Moscow. 
I cannot yet give specific data, but the assumption of a `Near 
Eastern connection' is not devoid of grounds. We have informed 
the special services of interested foreign states about this 
arrest."
