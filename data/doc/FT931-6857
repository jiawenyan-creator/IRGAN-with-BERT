FT  26 FEB 93 / Observer: Family affair
The House of Warburg must be feeling pretty pleased with itself because of
its role in the ICI demerger.
Leaving aside the accolades that will be heaped on a couple of S G Warburg
directors, John Walker-Haworth and Rory Tapner, for earning the firm some
very fat fees, Warburg can also point with pride to Goldman Sachs' Jon
Aisbitt, the other financial adviser. He honed his early merchant banking
skills at Warburg.
And don't forget John Mayo, finance director of Zeneca, the demerged drug
company - who just happens to have been recruited from Warburg. If only
ICI's Sir Denys Henderson had not decided to hog both chairmanships, it
might have been possible to find a job for Warburg chairman Sir David
Scholey. But then again that might have been just a little too incestuous.
