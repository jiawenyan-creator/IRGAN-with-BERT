FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Fokus Bank extends recovery
Fokus Bank, Norway's third largest commercial bank, said yesterday that
first-half profits after loan losses rose to NKr178.9m (Dollars 26m), up
from NKr145.8m a year earlier. Lower costs and reduced loan losses
compensated for losses on securities, it stated.
Mr Bjarne Borgersen, the bank's acting managing director, described the
result as 'very satisfying'. The figures consolidate the recovery achieved
last year when the bank reported its first profit for four years.
Fokus was taken over by the state in 1991 during Norway's biggest banking
crisis since the second world war.
Net loan losses for the period fell to NKr32.3m from NKr174.7m, ahead of the
bank's own projections, as total non-performing loans tumbled from NKr2.7bn
to NKr2.09bn.
Expenses were reduced by NKr63.8m to NKr450.3m as part of a sustained
cost-cutting exercise.
This year's turmoil in bond markets provided the main drag on the
performance. Fokus said it suffered a NKr27.0m net loss on securities after
making a profit of NKr89.9m in the first half of 1993.
