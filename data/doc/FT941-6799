FT  28 FEB 94 / International Company News: Smugglers hurt Tabacalera
Tabacalera, Spain's partly-privatised tobacco monopoly, hopes profits will
recover by at least 30 per cent this year after a 47 per cent fall in the
parent company's 1993 pre-tax earnings to Pta10.70bn.
Mr Pedro Perez, chairman, blamed a fall in the volume of the company's
cigarette sales largely on a thriving contraband business, estimated to take
15 per cent of the market, but said a crackdown on smuggling appeared to be
working.
Consolidated group profits plunged to Pta6.71bn (Dollars 48m) from
Pta20.05bn. After tax, the fall was even sharper, with the 1993 result of
Pta3.12bn standing at just a quarter of the previous year's level. Group
sales were almost 5 per cent down at Pta666bn.
This partly reflected disposals in the food sector but also a fall of more
than 7 per cent in the number of cigarettes sold through the group.
The company estimated that 650m packets of cigarettes were being smuggled
into Spain annually, mainly sold through bars and cafes.
Other factors hitting profits were a shift to cheaper brands - reflecting
increased tax on tobacco products - and the increased cost of
dollar-denominated raw materials.
Mr Perez, formerly state secretary for the economy, said he intended to
reduce operating costs by 10 per cent this year.
Tabacalera is 52 per cent owned by the state, with some 38 per cent held by
foreign investors, mainly financial institutions.
