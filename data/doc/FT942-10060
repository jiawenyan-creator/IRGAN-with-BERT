FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Ex-Celsis chief to sue for wrongful
dismissal
Mr Tony Martin, who was dismissed as chief executive of Celsis, the
biotechnology company, on March 31, is suing the company for wrongful
dismissal and defamation.
A statement issued on his behalf said that 'although his lawyers had tried
to negotiate terms with the company, he was afraid that discussions had made
little headway'.
Mr Martin said: 'I have no alternative now but to defend my reputation and
to demonstrate that there were no grounds on which my employment contract
could be terminated without notice.'
'Unless some of the founding shareholders allow executive management to
manage, I fear my head will not be the last to roll,' he said.
The founding shareholders are Mr Chris Evans and Mr John Morris. Both are
non-executive directors with 26 per cent and 17 per cent stakes
respectively.
Celsis said that it was 'disappointed' in Mr Martin's statements which would
'intensify the dispute'.
