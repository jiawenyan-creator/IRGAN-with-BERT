700 PROTEST U.S. AID TO EL SALVADOR 
Holding paper crosses bearing the names of six Jesuit priests murdered this 
week in San Salvador, about 700 people marched to MacArthur Park for a rally to 
protest the U.S. government's financial involvement in El Salvador's escalating 
civil war. The high turnout for the mile-long march was fueled by concern after 
a week of intense guerrilla warfare in El Salvador culminated in the murders of 
the priests in the capital city, said organizers who have frequently held 
rallies that have drawn fewer people. "I haven't come out for a long time to 
protest," said painter Antonio Bernal. "But things have gotten so bad that we 
have to do as much as we can to stop the killings."
