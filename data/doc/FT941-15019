FT  18 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Proton clinches order
Proton, the Malaysian car manufacturer, has won its first export order in
Indonesia. Under a memorandum of understanding signed in Jakarta, Indonesia
will import 1,500-3,000 Protons, which will be used as taxis.
The Proton sale forms part of a complex trade and investment deal being
negotiated by Malaysia and Indonesia.
Under agreements signed during a visit to Indonesia last week by Mr Anwar
Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister and finance minister, Malaysia
will contribute Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m) to a joint venture capital company
which will seek to develop small and medium-scale industries in Indonesia.
There are also talks on a possible sale to Malaysia of Indonesian transport
aircraft.
