FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: AGF issues warning for second
half
Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the French insurance group, warns that
second-half profits are likely to be below those of the first half due to
the impact of the economic recession and freak weather conditions in France,
writes Alice Rawsthorn from Paris.
Mr Michel Albert, chairman, said the 1993 results 'would definitely be less
than double' the outcome in the first half when it made static net profits
of FFr1.41bn (Dollars 241m).
However, Mr Albert stressed that he was not overly concerned about the
outcome for the full financial year. He said he was reasonably optimistic
about AGF's performance in spite of the tough economic environment.
AGF, which is a candidate for privatisation and had until recently been less
badly affected by the French recession than its competitors, made net
profits of FFr1.5bn on consolidated sales of FFr59bn in 1992.
