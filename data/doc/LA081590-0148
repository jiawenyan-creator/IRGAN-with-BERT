WORLD; 
NEPALESE LINE UP TO BUY FUEL 
Fearing that the Persian Gulf crisis will create new oil shortages in their 
Himalayan kingdom, Nepalese formed long lines today to buy fuel for their cars 
and homes. 
With memories of the cutoff in oil supplies by neighboring India fresh in their 
minds, people started lining up for kerosene, the only source of cooking and 
heating fuel, as soon as dawn broke over the mountaintops. 
Reports of rationing in India reached the Nepalese capital, and motorists today 
backed up in long lines at Nepal Oil Corp. facilities, the sole distributors of 
petroleum products in the Himalayan nation. 
Housewives and children carrying plastic cans waited in the long lines even 
though an official of the state-owned NOC said the stock of kerosene is 
adequate to meet the country's needs for a long time. 
NOC buys crude oil from the gulf countries for hard currency but its 
counterpart in India, the Indian Oil Co., handles the delivery.
