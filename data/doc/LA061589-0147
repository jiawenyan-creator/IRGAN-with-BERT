KEEP THAT MOTOR RUNNING: FANS CHASE PISTONS 
The Detroit Pistons returned in triumph Wednesday as about 2,000 broom-toting, 
screaming fans helped them celebrate their first National Basketball Assn. 
championship. 
Standing in a humid drizzle, the crowd chanted, "Bad Boys! Bad Boys!' -- the 
team's adopted nickname -- as the private jet touched down at Willow Run 
Airport. Not even jet engines could drown out the chants as the jet, Round Ball 
One, rolled to a stop. 
Players walked along the cordoned-off crowd, grasping hands, high-fiving and 
exchanging greetings. But they had to scramble back to the plane when the crowd 
broke through the cordon and swarmed toward the jet. 
The aircraft's engines were restarted and the jet taxied several hundred feet 
away so the Pistons could get on a waiting bus. 
But the players didn't mind. 
"There's no feeling like this," center James Edwards said. "I've seen how my 
friends are after winning the world championship, and now we've got one." 
"I don't know how I feel," said forward John Salley. "It's hit us, but it 
hasn't hit us. We're champions now. We came in with the right attitude, stayed 
modest, stayed humble. 
"We're the Bad Boys." 
The Pistons completed their sweep of the Lakers on Tuesday night, 105-97.
