  [Excerpts] Kisumu, 25 May (KNA) -- The government has 
assured the consumers of resources based on the Kenyan side of 
the Lake Victoria that they have nothing to fear and should 
continue with their activities as usual. 
  Reacting to various press reports to the effect that 
thousands of decomposing corpses being swept into Lake Victoria 
through River Kagera was a big environmental risk, Nyanza P.C. 
[provincial commissioner] Mr. J.K. Kaguthi stressed that 
available scientific fact confirms that the Lake Victoria waters 
of the Kenya side were safe, including the popular species of 
fish such as Tilapia and Nile Perch. [passage omitted] 
  The team [as received] noted the chances of our fish or our 
waters being contaminated or polluted as a result of the 
decomposing bodies from the Kagera River mouth are remote and 
people should continue eating their fish. The government noted 
that all relevant agencies, including the provincial security 
committee, marine and medical experts will continue to monitor 
the situation when the need arises.
