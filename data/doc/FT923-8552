FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: Strong sales help Chugai to beat
forecast
CHUGAI Pharmaceutical, a leading Japanese drug company, yesterday reported a
sharp rise in interim profits for the first six months to June, thanks to
strong sales of its blood and body-fluid agents.
Chugai's non-consolidated pre-tax profits rose 50 per cent to Y5.8bn
(Dollars 45.5m), some Y2bn higher than it forecast. Operating profits soared
97.7 per cent to Y6.7bn, on a 7.1 per cent rise in overall sales to Y68.8bn.
Net profits rose 6.1 per cent to Y2bn.
Sales of Chugai's blood and body-fluid agents, including Epogin, a renal
anaemia remedy, surged 77.7 per cent to Y15.8bn. However, sales of metabolic
agents fell 9.6 per cent to Y12.1bn.
The company reported extraordinary losses of Y1.3bn related to the
liquidation of Chugai-Upjohn, a Chicago-based joint venture with Upjohn, the
US pharmaceutical group.
For the year to December, Chugai expects a 32.3 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Y14bn, a Y2bn increase from its previous estimates, on a 8.8 per
cent increase in sales to Y145bn. Net profits are expected to rise 33.2 per
cent to Y5.5bn, Y500m higher than initial projections.
Showa Denko, a leading Japanese chemicals manufacturer, suffered a 76.7 per
cent fall in first-half pre-tax profits as weakening sales compounded the
burden of settling US lawsuits related to a dietary supplement, writes
Gordon Cramb in Tokyo.
Showa Denko wrote off Y19.9bn in the six months to June, of which Y12.3bn
went to patients in the US who had alleged that its L-Tryptophan nutritional
compound caused blood disorders and muscle pains. The remainder was absorbed
by legal fees and in providing for a research fund.
On sales 15.6 per cent down at Y259.9bn, taxable profits in the six months
to June were Y2.84bn. Net earnings were 43.9 per cent lower at Y1.09bn.
