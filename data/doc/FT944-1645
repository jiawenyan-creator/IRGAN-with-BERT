FT  19 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: News round-up - Hong Kong
Share prices are expected to move higher this week, after the Hang Seng
index's climb through the 8,000-point level last week, writes Louise Lucas.
The index picked up 4.8 per cent last week and closed on Friday at 8,166.39,
although turnover remained thin. However, the index is unlikely to breach
8,500 because of the negative view being taken of the property market, which
claims an exposure of some 40 per cent on the index.
The sector was not encouraged by last week's withdrawal of a building plot
at auction in the face of no bids, while fears over China's spiralling
inflation have also taken a toll.
Late last week, the market took heart from gains on Wall Street, and a
belief that the US Federal Open Market Committee may not raise interest
rates tomorrow, but instead wait until the new year.
The bargain hunting and short-covering sparked by last Thursday's recovery
are likely to recur if interest rates are not lifted, although brokers
continue to warn against seeing any bounce as a convincing recovery.
