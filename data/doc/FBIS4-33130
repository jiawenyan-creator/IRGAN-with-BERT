<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno; from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Guillermo Alvarez Bajares, Central Information 
Office [OCI] director, has confirmed the resignation of Asdrubal 
Batista from the post of economic reform minister. 
  [Briceno] OCI Director Guillermo Alvarez Bajares has 
provided 
the information but declined to comment on the reasons that 
prompted Batista to resign, as contained in a letter addressed 
to President Rafael Caldera. Alvarez has said the president will 
not appoint a new minister for this portfolio, and he dismissed 
the possibility that Batista's resignation reflects a serious 
crisis within the economic cabinet. He contradicted himself in 
this regard when he said there were differences of opinion with 
the former head of the Reform of the National Economy Ministry. 
  [Begin Alvarez recording] It is clear, and you have cited 
the 
fact on many occasions, certain differences within the economic 
cabinet emerged some weeks ago; this is something one cannot 
hide. As I said at the beginning, we have sought to help in this 
way to make the president and the economic cabinet demonstrate 
to the country a coherence greater than the one they have been 
exhibiting thus far. This conflicts with the differences that 
have caused some damage to the image of the country in terms of 
image and opinion. [end recording]
