  [Text] Seoul, April 5 (YONHAP) -- North Korea sent a letter 
to the United States in late March, saying it is willing to 
accept further inspection of its nuclear sites by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) if the U.S. withdraws 
a precondition of exchanging special envoys between Seoul and 
Pyongyang, a senior government official here said on Tuesday. 
  Washington has called on North Korea to exchange special 
envoys between Seoul and Pyongyang as a precondition to resume a 
third round high-level talks between the U.S. and North Korea. 
  North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu sent the 
letter to the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, 
the official said. 
  Both Kang and Gallucci are chief negotiators of North Korea 
and the U.S., respectively, at the high-level talks between 
North Korea and the U.S. 
  The U.S. Government informed South Korean Foreign Minister 
Han Sung-chu of the North Korean proposal, who visited the U.S. 
recently, and Han and his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher 
discussed the matter, but gained no conclusion, the official 
said.
