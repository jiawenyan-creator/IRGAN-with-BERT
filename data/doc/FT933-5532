FT  02 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
PROFIT-TAKING in the derivatives, the first signs of which was seen on
Tuesday, gathered momentum yesterday sending the futures contract into
retreat, writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening trade in the September contract on the FT-SE 100 at 3,102 turned
out to be lower than many traders had predicted, setting the tone for the
rest of the morning.
Continuous selling mainly from independent traders saw September not only
test the 3,096 resistance level, but to actually break through it to fall to
a day's low of 3,078.
However, during the afternoon, a firm Wall Street helped dealers turn more
positive and sporadic buying from some of the larger institutions helped
September reduce earlier losses, and pull the under lying cash market
higher.
It finished at 3,094, 14 lower than its previous close and about 7 points
ahead of its fair value premium to cash. Volume in September was 9,465,
while that in the December contract was just over 2,000 contracts.
The traded options had a lacklustre session in which volume declined to
21,602, against Tuesday's 29,659. Around half of the day's total was dealt
in the index options with 8,151 in the FT-SE 100 and a more modest 2,181
lots done in the Euro FT-SE 100.
Ladbroke was the busiest stock option ahead of today's figures, trading
2,181 contracts.
