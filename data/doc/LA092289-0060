THE WORLD; 
SAUDIS EXECUTE 16 SHIITES 
Sixteen Shiite Muslims from Kuwait were beheaded in Saudi Arabia for exploding 
two bombs in Mecca last July at the height of the Muslim pilgrimage to the holy 
city, the Saudi Interior Ministry said. A statement carried by the official 
Saudi Press Agency said 10 of those beheaded were of Iranian origin and two 
were of Saudi descent. The statement implicitly blamed Iran for the attacks, 
which killed a man and wounded 16 others. The explosions occurred despite tight 
security during the annual hajj, or pilgrimage, attended by about 1.5 million 
Muslim pilgrims from around the world.
