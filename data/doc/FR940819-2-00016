DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection
of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35).



Agency: 

Bureau of the Census.


Title: 

Feature and Address Reference Source Assessment Survey (FARSAS).


Form Number(s): 

GEOMAF1.


Agency Approval Number: 

None.


Type of Request: 

New collection.


Burden: 

2,656 hours.


Number of Respondents: 

7,967.


Avg Hours Per Response: 

20 minutes.


Needs and Uses: 

For the 2000 decennial census, as well as other census programs, the Census Bureau is building on its 1990 census address
list to create a permanent and continuously maintained Master Address File (MAF). We will link this national inventory
of living quarters to the Census Bureau's Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER)
data base. The existence of such a linked address/geographic file for the nation will provide important opportunities
for the Census Bureau's research and demographic programs. The Census Bureau currently solicits the participation
of local governments and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in a cooperative arrangement to determine
the locations of missing addresses and streets to assist us in maintaining the TIGER data base. For those not wishing
to participate we will conduct the FARSAS to help us determine both the availability and usefulness of reference materials
we can use to update the TIGER data base for those areas. On the basis of information collected during FARSAS we will
be able to resolve nonmatching cases from the geocoding process.


Affected Public: 

State or local governments.


Frequency: 

One time only.


Respondent's Obligation: 

Voluntary.


OMB Desk Officer: 

Maria Gonzalez, (202) 3957313.
