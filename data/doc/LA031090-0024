DUCHESNAYS CAN'T CATCH SOVIET SKATERS 
He wore a torn striped shirt with a tie. She wore a tattered red dress. If 
there was a sequin or a feather on the ice, it was left behind by a previous 
ice dance team. 
Skating a freestyle program Friday night at the world championships that 
depicted the difficulties of daily life for peasants in South America, the 
innovative brother and sister team of Isabelle and Paul Duchesnay earned the 
most perfect scores of 6.0 in a major competition since British dancers Jayne 
Torvill and Christopher Dean in 1984. 
But even though the Duchesnays' daring freestyle program was a winner, they 
settled for second place. They could not overcome the lead defending champions 
Marina Klimova and Sergei Ponomarenko of the Soviet Union built in winning the 
first two phases of the competition. 
In contrast to the Duchesnays, Klimova and Ponomarenko skated a traditional 
program to "My Fair Lady." The reaction of the capacity crowd of 9,500 at the 
Halifax Metro Centre was exactly that: fair. The Duchesnays received a 
five-minute standing ovation. 
Even though they represent France, the Duchesnays were raised in Canada. They 
have become the most popular skaters since Torvill and Dean, who won four world 
championships (1981-84) and an Olympic gold medal in 1984. All nine judges gave 
them perfect scores for artistic impression after that performance. The 
Duchesnays received five 6.0s for artistic impression here.
