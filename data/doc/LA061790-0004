OUTTAKES 
Bo Derek's first film in five years -- "Ghosts Can't Do It" -- recently 
materialized in 16 cities across the country, grossing a paltry $25,000 in two 
weeks. But the actress professes no anguish, admitting the "little $3-million 
movie" could have gone straight to video. 
"It's a nice, intimate entertainment," she tells us, "which means it's 
difficult for it to compete theatrically." 
Produced by Bo with husband John Derek -- who's also the writer, director, 
editor and cinematographer -- "Ghosts" is already down to half a dozen 
theaters. At present, Triumph Releasing doesn't have an L.A. showing scheduled. 
The film is a May-December romance in which screen hubby Anthony Quinn dies and 
returns as a ghost in search of a young, virile male body to inhabit. There's 
nudity -- Bo's -- and a cameo by Donald Trump. 
As for Bo and John's real-life May-December marriage (she's now 33 to his 63): 
"Everything's going well. We're working together -- which is what we want." 
They're developing more projects, she says, but she's also "having talks" about 
working in a "mainstream" movie without him. 
"I'm more capable now. I think I could handle it," says the woman who became an 
instant celebrity with the 1979 film "10." 
Does she think her career's been sliding ever since? 
"Not at all. I was so unready for all that happened with '10.' I decided I 
wanted to become the master of my own destiny. I've been learning about 
producing films these last 10 years. And getting the financing. 
"I've broadened my horizons." Pat H. Broeske
