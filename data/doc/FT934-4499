FT  03 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Dealing with late payers (1)
Sir, While the adverse impact which late payment of trade debt has on
company cash flows cannot be denied, we can hope that the government
undertakes an objective assessment of all the causes before being seduced
into seeing the statutory right to interest on late payment as a panacea.
Working in this area for clients both large and small, we continue to find
that many of the causes of late payment lie within the seller's own sales
and delivery process. This includes, for example, poor specification of
contractual terms and failure to invoice, or invoice correctly, until well
after supply. Looking inwardly and addressing internal operating
deficiencies may prove harder than placing all responsibility for late
payment on to the customer but, in our experience, this approach has always
achieved reductions of more than 50 per cent in overdue debt outstanding.
Of course there are managements which are bad payers as a matter of intent,
and sellers need the means to secure swift and just redress. However, for
small businesses, in particular, the existing legal process is seen as slow
and cumbersome, with the likely result not expected to accord with the
resources required to achieve it. Rather than adding more legislative
burdens to inadequate mechanisms, the government would do better to make the
existing legal process in this area work more effectively for the plaintiff.
