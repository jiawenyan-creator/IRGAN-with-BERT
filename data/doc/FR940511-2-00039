<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

DOE announces that pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1), it intends to award a nomcompetitive
financial assistance grant to the state of Nevada, Department of Human Resources (NDHR), for providing environmental
oversight and monitoring initiatives, which will ensure the DOE Nevada Operations Office compliance with applicable

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The state of Nevada, NDHR, will develop programs for oversight to ensure compliance with applicable federal, state,

The state of Nevada will assume a more substantive role in overseeing DOE's compliance with state environmental laws,
and to help assure the citizens of Nevada that DOE operations do not constitute a health hazard.

thereby precluding DOE provisions of support to another entity.

The term of this grant is for five years and will commence July 1, 1994, and end June 30, 1999. The total estimated cost
