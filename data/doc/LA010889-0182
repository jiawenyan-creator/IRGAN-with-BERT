SITUATION REGARDING TENURE AT UC IRVINE 
Regarding the article "Blacks, Women Charge UC Irvine With Prejudice" (Dec. 
18): 
As one of the relatively few minority graduate students at UC Irvine, it was 
disheartening for me to read about the experiences of the women and men who 
were denied tenure and other promotions at UCI. Apparently the University of 
California motto, "Let there be light," does not apply to UC Irvine's faculty 
promotion policies.
