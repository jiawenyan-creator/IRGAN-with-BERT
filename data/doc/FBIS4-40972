  [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- After signing the NATO 
"Partnership for Peace" plan and a bilateral protocol Russia 
will equally cooperate with "major European, leading partners in 
European and global security", Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev told mass media chiefs on Tuesday before departing for 
Brussels where he is to sign the two documents on Wednesday. 
  He added that the "Russia-NATO" protocol reflects the status 
of Russia as a superpower. 
  Kozyrev categorically denied allegations that Russia claimed 
a "special status" in the partnership programme. "We are as 
equal a member of the UN as, say, the State of Fiji. All 
countries have an equal legal status in the framework of the 
(NATO) partnership, whether it is a mighty nuclear power, like 
the USA, or Belgium with its two or three divisions", he said.
