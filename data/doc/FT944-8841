FT  18 NOV 94 / Hong Kong airport land deal
Hong Kong cleared another hurdle yesterday in its quest for a comprehensive
agreement with China on building a modern airport and railway. The
Sino-British Land Commission agreed the terms by which the land occupied by
the airport and its connecting railway will be vested in the two government
corporations responsible for the project. The land will be released as part
of the commission's annual land grants over the coming three years as the
need for it arises. Sales of the land are expected to help finance the whole
project to the tune of HKDollars 20bn (Pounds 1.6bn).
The agreement comes ahead of deliberations today in the colony's Legislation
Council on a government request for HKDollars 23bn in funds for the project.
The council is expected to support this request, which will clear the way
for the Mass Transit Railway Corporation to award formally many works
contracts it had only let provisionally. These are expected to total in
excess of HKDollars 15bn and will cover such items as rolling stock.
Britain and China have yet to agree the detailed terms by which the MTRC and
the Provisional Airport Authority will be permitted to borrow a further
HKDollars 23bn of funds. The Hong Kong government hopes agreement can be
reached by the end of the year.
