Harry Rudolph III of La Jolla shot a six-under-par 65 at the Los Serranos Golf 
and Country Club in Chino Tuesday to lead the 79th Southern California 
qualifying for next month's state amateur championship. 
The final round of the 36-hole event will be played today. 
The top 100 golfers from Tuesday's opening field of 400 made it into the second 
round and the top 43 from that field will qualify for the championship, which 
begins June 25 at Cypress Point Golf Club on the Monterey Peninsula. 
Rudolph, who plays for Oklahoma State, shot a 34 on the front side and a 31 on 
the back nine over the 6,292-yard, par-71 North Course at Los Serranos. 
A stroke behind Rudolph was Daniel Baker of Mission Viejo. At 67 were Chris 
Anderson of West Covina and Paul Mohler of Villa Park. Kevin Eden of Granada 
Hills shot a 68 and Mike Blum of Seal Beach, Trevor Jones of Pasadena and Paul 
Holtby of Simi Valley were at 69. 
Half of the field played on the tougher, 7,007-yard, par-74 South Course. They 
were led by Bob Imlay of San Diego, who shot a three-under 71. Craig Ballard of 
El Toro and Jim Myers of Oceanside had 72s and Kevin Claborn of Brea, Mike 
Bestor of Laguna Niguel and Scott Schweizer of Placentia were tied at 73. 
The players will switch courses for today's round. RICH TOSCHES
