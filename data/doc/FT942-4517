FT  09 JUN 94 / Price war hits small shops says Northern
Northern Foods, the UK dairy and foods manufacturer, warned yesterday that
the fall in UK food prices - caused by the supermarket price war - was set
to continue.
Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman, reporting a small improvement in full-year
pre-tax profits to Pounds 157.2m, said: 'In the short term, I can see no
let-up in price deflation. I suspect low inflation will be an element in the
food industry for the foreseeable future. This means the industry may be
going in the opposite direction from the economy.'
He said food deflation, the first the UK had experienced since the 1930s,
was running at around 2 per cent. Since the country entered the Common
Market in 1972, food inflation had averaged 10-15 per cent a year.
As a result of aggressive price-cutting by the big supermarkets, Northern's
doorstep deliveries of milk fell 12 per cent over the year, while van
deliveries of food to small shops dropped 15 per cent. But sales to its four
biggest customers - Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway - rose 6
per cent, and now accounted for 34 per cent of group turnover. Sales to
Marks &amp; Spencer showed their biggest ever rise in volume, though not in
value.
Mr Haskins said that despite the sharp fall in home milk sales - likely to
be repeated this year - the system of doorstep delivery in the UK was not
under immediate threat. 'I'm more concerned about small shops,' he said.
'There could be serious social problems if there are no small shops in this
country, and the way things are going there won't be any.'
Despite the price war, he said, 'I see no reason why our record of
continuous growth should be in jeopardy this year.'
On sales up 1 per cent at Pounds 2.05bn, operating profits fell 1 per cent
to Pounds 178.8m. Operating profits from dairy were Pounds 88.9m (Pounds
92.0m), from convenience foods Pounds 45.6m (Pounds 44.4m), from meat
products Pounds 18.0m (Pounds 20.2m) and from grocery products Pounds 26.3m
(Pounds 24.2m).
Lower interest costs left pre-tax profits up 2.6 per cent at Pounds 157.2m.
Earnings per share were up 2.1 per cent at 20.51p, while the dividend was
raised 4.8 per cent to 8.8p, after a 5.3p final. Northern's shares rose 4p
to 212p.
