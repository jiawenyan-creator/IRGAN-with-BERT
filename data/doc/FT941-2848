FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Dawsongroup advances 67% to Pounds 7.9m
Dawsongroup, the Milton Keynes-based commercial vehicle hire and
distribution company, lifted pre-tax profits by 67 per cent for the year
ended December 31.
Mr Peter Dawson, the executive chairman who holds almost 65 per cent of the
shares, said that the performance proved that the company had pursued the
right strategy through the recession.
Profits were up from Pounds 4.75m to Pounds 7.92m. Turnover grew by 14 per
cent from Pounds 46.7m to Pounds 53.3m, and operating margins rose from 19.2
per cent to 24.2 per cent.
Earnings per share rose from 10.4p to 17.3p. A final dividend of 3p is
proposed, giving a total of 4.5p (3p).
Mr Dawson, who today resigns as executive chairman to become chairman and
managing director of a new Dutch division, said the group was continuing to
make progress to broaden its customer base.
The group has two main divisions - truck and trailer rentals and a large
Volvo truck dealership.
The rentals division's profits before tax were 77 per cent ahead from Pounds
4.21m to Pounds 7.45m on turnover up 8 per cent at Pounds 36.6m (Pounds
34m).
Mr Michael Williams, who took over as chief executive in November, said the
key factor in the rentals division performance had been the utilisation and
hire rates on short-term rentals for both trucks and rentals.
The average short-term truck fleet was 11 per cent down, while utilisation
was 4 percentage points ahead at 76 per cent. The average short-term trailer
fleet was 14 per cent ahead, with utilisation maintained at 83 per cent.
The size of the contract hire fleet, which contributes 40 per cent of
revenue, had been maintained. In contrast, the portable cold store fleet
grew by 40 per cent and doubled turnover to Pounds 2m.
Pre-tax profits for the commercial vehicles division fell from Pounds
534,000 to Pounds 475,000 on turnover sharply up from Pounds 23m to Pounds
35.3m.
Mr Dawson said he expected to see continued growth in the coming year. The
two-week old international division, which he is heading will operate in the
cold store and trailer markets, and hopes to have 25 units in each market by
the year end.
