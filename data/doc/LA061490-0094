New York Yankee pitcher Pascual Perez needs arthroscopic surgery on his right 
shoulder and will likely miss the rest of the season, according to the team's 
physician. 
Perez, who signed a three-year, $5.7-million contract last winter, underwent a 
CAT-scan on Wednesday to determine whether he'd pitch again this year. 
In three starts for the Yankees, Perez was 1-2 with a 1.29 earned run average.
