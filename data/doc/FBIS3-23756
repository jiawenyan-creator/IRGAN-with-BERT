<F P=106> [Unsigned article: "Attempts To Solve the Housing </F>
Problem Are Being Made Through Private Construction"] 
  [Text] Moscow's government is taking very uncommon steps in 
trying to cut down, at least somewhat, the number of persons on 
the housing waiting list. As MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS found out, 
the Northeast Administrative Okrug has begun an unusual 
experiment to introduce a new form of cooperation in housing 
construction. 
  The idea of this experiment is that persons on the list who 
do not want to wait endlessly for housing may organize 
themselves into collectives and seek investors or organizations 
which may want to undertake the construction of housing units. 
An indispensable condition for this kind of construction is that 
the investor must allocate 50 percent of the living space to 
persons on the housing waiting list. 
  Persons on the waiting list will look for housing 
construction areas themselves and will have to coordinate their 
activities only with the local prefecture. 
  If this experiment proves successful, this kind of 
construction cooperation will take place in every part of Moscow.
