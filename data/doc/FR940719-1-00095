27. Section 75.371 is amended by revising paragraphs (b), (s), (z) and (bb) to read as follows: 



75.371

Mine ventilation plan; contents. 



* * * * * 



(b) Planned main mine fan stoppages, other than those scheduled for testing, maintenance or adjustment, including
procedures to be followed during these stoppages and subsequent restarts (see 75.311(a)) and the type of device
to be used for monitoring main mine fan pressure, if other than a pressure recording device (see 75.310(a)(4)). Alternative
methods for testing fan signals and automatic closing doors in lieu of stopping the main mine fan. (see 75.312(c)
and (d)). 



* * * * * 



(s) The locations and frequency of the methane tests if required more often by 75.362(d)(1)(iii) (see 75.362
(d)(1)(iii). 



* * * * * 



(z) The locations where measurements of methane and oxygen concentrations and air quantities and tests to determine
whether the air is moving in the proper direction will be made to evaluate the ventilation of nonpillared worked-out
areas (see 75.364 (a)(1)) and the effectiveness of bleeder systems (see 75.364 (a)(2)(iii). Alternative
methods of evaluation of the effectiveness of bleeder systems (75.364 (a)(2)(iv)). 



* * * * * 



(bb) The location of ventilation devices such as regulators, stoppings and bleeder connectors used to control air
movement through worked-out areas (see 75.334(c)(4)). The location and sequence of construction of proposed
seals for each worked-out area. (see 75.334(e))

28. The Agency is asking for comments on paragraph (r) of 
75.371 which is identical to the text published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 15, 1992 (57 FR 20925). This paragraph is being reproposed and republished for the convenience of the readers
to read as follows: 



75.371 



Mine ventilation plan; contents. 



* * * * * 



(r) The quantity of air and ventilation controls that will be provided during the installation and removal of mechanized
mining equipment (see 75.325(d)). 



* * * * * 



29. Section 75.372 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(3) and adding paragraphs (b)(19)and (b)(20) to read as follows:




75.372 



Mine ventilation map. 



* * * * * 



(b) * * * 

(3) All known mine workings that are located in the same coalbed within 1,000 feet of existing or projected workings.
These workings may be shown on a mine map with a scale other than that required by paragraph (a) of this section, if the
scale does not exceed 2,000 feet to the inch and is specified on the map. 



* * * * * 



(19) The entry height, velocity and direction of the air current at or near the midpoint of each belt flight where the
height and width of the entry are representative of the belt haulage entry. 

(20) The location and designation of air courses that 
have been redesignated from intake to return for the purpose of ventilation of structures, areas or installations
that are required by this subpart D to be ventilated to return air courses, and for ventilation of seals. 



* * * * * 



30. Section 75.380 is amended by revising paragraphs (d)(3), (d)(4)(ii), (d)(5), (f) and (i)(2); and by adding paragraph
(d)(4)(iii) to read as follows: 



* * * * * 



75.380 



Escapeways; bituminous and lignite mines. 



* * * * * 



(d) * * * 

(3) Maintained to at least a height of 5 feet from the mine floor to the mine roof, excluding the thickness of any roof
support, except that the escapeways shall be maintained to at least the height of the coalbed, excluding the thickness
of any roof support, where the coalbed is less than 5 feet. In areas of mines where escapeways pass through doors, the
height may be less than 5 feet, provided that sufficient height is maintained to enable miners, including disabled
persons, to escape quickly in an emergency. In areas of mines developed before November 16, 1992, where escapeways
pass over or under overcasts, or undercasts the height may be less than 5 feet provided that sufficient height is maintained
to enable miners, including disabled persons, to escape quickly in an emergency; 



* * * * * 



(4) * * * 

(ii) Where the route of travel passes through doors or other permanent ventilation controls, the escapeway shall
be at least 4-feet wide to enable miners to escape quickly in an emergency, or 

(iii) Where the alternate escapeway passes through doors or other permanent ventilation controls or where supplemental
roof support is required, and it can be demonstrated that sufficient width is maintained to enable miners, including
disabled persons, to escape quickly in an emergency. 

(5) Located to follow the most direct, safe and practical route to the nearest mine opening suitable for the safe evacuation
of miners; and
