FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Micro Focus shares surge on news of 25%
advance
Shares in Micro Focus, the Berkshire-based software house, rose 242p to
close at Pounds 10.65 following an encouraging first quarter which suggests
the company may be successfully moving from slow growing mainframe products
to fast developing networked systems.
Over the past year the share price had fallen steeply following anxieties,
especially in the US, about its trading prospects in the light of a shift
among customers away from mainframes.
The company made a profit before tax of Pounds 2.9m in the quarter ended
April 30, a 25 per cent advance on the Pounds 2.31m recorded last time.
Revenues rose from Pounds 16.5m to Pounds 20.2m, a 24 per cent improvement.
Growth in costs and expenses was held to 22 per cent. Earnings per share
were 23 per cent ahead at 13.8p (11.2p).
Although Micro Focus shares are traded extensively in the US as ADRs, the
company does not usually issue quarterly reports.
It said it was considering stock incentive plans for its staff; the
quarterly state-ment complied with Stock Exchange regulations on price
sensitive information in order to be able to implement these plans.
Mr Paul O'Grady, chairman, said it was an encouraging start to the year. The
company had prevented further erosion in its earnings and he believed
profits before tax for the second half of 1994 would be greater than the
first half.
Micro Focus develops software tools which make it easier for programmers to
write programs for large scale systems. Revenues from the company's core
mainframe products grew only 4 per cent, but represented 39 per cent of the
total, down from 47 per cent in the previous year.
There was healthy growth in networking products, where revenues grew 36 per
cent to reach 37 per cent of total revenues.
