  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- The banking system will see 
a net liquidity surplus of 4.10 trillion yen in June, the Bank 
of Japan (BOJ) said Friday [27 May]. 
  The projected surplus, excluding government bond issuance, 
reflects a 6.20 trillion yen net inflow of treasury funds, 
against a net drainage from the system of 2.10 trillion yen in 
cash. 
  The 4.10 trillion yen surplus compares with a 3.99 trillion 
yen net surplus seen a year earlier. 
  The central bank said the cash outflow will be caused by 
summer bonus payments for civil servants and private-sector 
employees. 
  The outstanding cash balance is projected to increase 5.7 
percent at the end of June from a year earlier. 
  Redemption of government bonds, meanwhile, will be a major 
booster for treasury fund inflows, the bank said.
