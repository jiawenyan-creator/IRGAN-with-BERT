SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department (MHTD), will prepare an environmental
impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to upgrade U.S. Route 50 to a dual-lane facility starting 0.7 mile west of Routes
D and T in Cole county and continuing to a point west of the cityof Sedalia in Pettis county. The EIS will also include
U.S. Route 65 through the city of Sedalia. A location study will run concurrently with the preparation of the EIS and
will provide definitive alternatives for evaluation by the EIS. The proposed action will accomplish several goals
(1) improve safety and capacity for through traffic on U.S. Route 50, (2) to study the need for a dual-lane bypass around
the cities of Sedalia, Syracuse, Tipton, California, and St. Martins and (3) promote economic development for the
counties involved in the cities mentioned above.





1. The proposed project begins at 0.7 mile west of Routes D and T in Cole county and continues to a point west of the city
of Sedalia in Pettis county. The project is approximately 70.0 miles in length. The proposed facility will provide
a four-lane, limited-access roadway with at-grade intersections or interchanges at major arterial crossroads.

2. Alternatives under consideration include ``build'' alternatives north and/or south of the existing route that
could be either parallel or on relocation. Other alternatives include transportation management options as well
as a ``no build'' alternative.

3. To date, preliminary information has been issued to local officials and other interested parties. The scoping
process was initiated with federal, state, and local agencies at a scoping meeting on October 11, 1994. Further public
meetings and hearings will be held. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action is addressed
and all significant issues are identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments
and questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or to the MHTD at the addresses
provided above.

 

Issued on: November 3, 1994.
