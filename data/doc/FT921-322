FT  30 MAR 92 / International Company News: Fermenta tumbles
FERMENTA, the Swedish industrial group, reported a loss of SKr1.23bn
(Dollars 206m) in 1991, after financial items, compared with a loss of
SKr599m last time, writes Sarah Webb.
The group said Independent, its troubled financial subsidiary which it sold
in March 1992, was partly responsible for the losses.
