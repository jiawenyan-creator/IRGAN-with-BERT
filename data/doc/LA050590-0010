GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION 
Georgia -- now there's an enlightened state. In Georgia the only requirements 
for gun ownership are an assertion of sanity and a driver's license. 
(And, of course, the price of the gun.) One then instantly qualifies for 
possession of a killing weapon and becomes the proud owner thereof -- no 
inconvenient waiting. 
And that's exactly what happened when a mental patient treated for "homicidal 
tendencies" bought a gun, hours after his release from a mental hospital. He 
then went on a shooting spree, killing and wounding (Part A, April 26). 
Gov. Joe Frank Harris, reacting to public furor, conceded that the shootings do 
make a strong statement for gun control, at which time pragmatism apparently 
struck, and in a brilliant conclusion stated, "I'm not sure any gun control 
could prevent something like this from happening." 
The good ol' boys in the NRA must jus' love Georgia to death.
