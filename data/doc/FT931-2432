FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: SEC backs changes to sales of
mutual funds
AN IMPORTANT change in the way in which mutual fund shares are sold in the
US could be in the offing.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission, the securities industry watchdog,
yesterday voted to propose a rule change which would allow investors to buy
shares in mutual funds - the US equivalent of the UK's unit trusts - through
advertisements in newspapers and magazines.
At present, investors can only buy shares in a mutual fund after seeing the
full official offering document for the investment vehicle.
This contrasts sharply with the situation in the UK, where 'off-the-page'
advertising by unit trust companies is commonplace.
The proposed rule change, however, would only apply to funds which have been
registered with the SEC for two years or more, and investors would receive a
full prospectus with confirmation of their order.
Advertisments would also be subject to the same legal liability provisions
as traditional prospectuses.
The proposed rule change, which has been published for comment, would not
require Congressional approval.
