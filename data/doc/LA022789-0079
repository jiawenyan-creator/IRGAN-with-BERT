ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
SANTA ANA; 
FIRE HITS EMPTY HOUSE; DAMAGE PUT AT $20,000 
A fire attributed to transients or children caused $20,000 in damage to an 
unoccupied house Sunday night, Santa Ana fire officials said. 
The blaze at 5404 W. 4th St. was reported at 6:21 p.m. and brought under 
control about 10 minutes later, Battalion Chief Jess Hernandez said. 
"When I say the damage was about $20,000, I mean to the structure itself, 
because the house was abandoned," Hernandez said. "There was just trash inside 
the house." 
While the cause of the fire is unknown and under investigation, Hernandez said 
that "it was probably started by transients or kids." 
The fire erupted in a rear room of the single-story, single-family home, 
Hernandez said. The blaze did not spread to any other structures, and no 
injuries were reported.
