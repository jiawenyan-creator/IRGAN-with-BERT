IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
MENOPAUSE TIED TO HEART ILLS 
Menopause appears to increase the risk of heart disease for women by causing 
harmful changes in their cholesterol levels, researchers at UC San Diego 
reported last week in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
The researchers tested 541 healthy women before they went through menopause in 
1983 and 1984 for a variety of factors believed associated with an increased 
risk for heart disease. When they later compared the 69 women who went through 
menopause in the next 2 1/2 years to those who did not, the menopausal women 
had about twice the increase in their blood levels of low-density lipoprotein. 
LDL is known as "bad cholesterol" because it tends to accumulate inside artery 
walls, setting the stage for heart attacks. The menopausal women also had a 
significant drop in their levels of high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, a form of 
cholesterol thought to help reduce LDL levels. 
Women usually go through menopause in their 50s, when their ovaries stop 
producing the female hormone estrogen. From staff and wire reports
