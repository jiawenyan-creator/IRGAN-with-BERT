FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Sumitomo Rubber's pre-tax
profits up 2.8 per cent
SUMITOMO Rubber, Japan's third-largest tyremaker and parent of Dunlop in
Europe and the US, lifted pre-tax profits 2.8 per cent to Y4.8bn (Dollars
38m) in the first half to June, writes Gordon Cramb.
Parent company revenues were 2.3 per cent ahead at Y123.4bn. Although
falling sales of new cars in Japan left demand for its tyres unchanged,
sales of its golf and tennis goods improved by 3.1 per cent.
Non-tyre sales - which also include marine equipment and office machinery -
accounted for a record 37.7 per cent of its overall business.
Profit growth is forecast to be more sluggish for the full year, up 0.5 per
cent before tax at Y11.6bn on a 4.2 per cent rise in sales to Y265bn.
