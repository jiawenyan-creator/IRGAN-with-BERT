FT  18 NOV 94 / Cardoso gears up for drive on reform
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's president-elect, yesterday promised
to deliver 'sustainable' economic development and said the victories of
candidates from his Social Democracy party (PSDB) in this week's state
elections showed voters wanted a 'more modern, more open' economy.
Mr Cardoso, who takes office on January 1, was speaking after Tuesday's
elections in which the PSDB won six out of 27 governorships, including the
three most important states. Political analysts say the party's strong
performance, and Mr Cardoso's easy win in the presidential race last month,
has given him an exceptional opportunity to push ahead with reform of
Brazil's economy and government.
Mr Cardoso said his advisers were working on detailed reform proposals,
which would be announced closer to his inauguration. He the first priority
would be to continue the struggle against inflation. Inflation has fallen
this year thanks to a new currency, the Real, which Mr Cardoso helped plan
when finance minister. He said a 'series of measures' were needed to reform
the public finances.
As well as tax and social security reform, his advisers are thought to be
planning a shake-up of the government administrative machine and overhauls
to the nearly bankrupt state banking system.
He said he would announce his cabinet 'around the end of December' and
wanted a mixture of technical and political experience.
Mr Cardoso said he would soon begin talks with the leaders of other
political parties to build a working majority in Congress. He is especially
interested in attracting the support of the so-called 'ethical wing' of the
Democratic Movement (PMDB), the country's largest political party.
