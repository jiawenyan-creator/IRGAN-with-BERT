FT  11 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Some MGN allocations to be scaled down
SOME allocations of shares in Mirror Group Newspapers are to be scaled down
with the Pounds 142.5m offer for sale being oversubscribed by a hair's
breadth.
Samuel Montagu, financial adviser to the flotation, said yesterday that
applications for a total of 121.92m shares had been received, making the
offer of 114m shares seven per cent oversubscribed.
The public subscribed for about Pounds 85m worth of the shares sold in the
UK offer. Institutions accounted for the balance of the applications.
Apart from employees who get priority treatment and will have applications
satisfied in full, people who asked for more than 1,500 shares are being
allocated only 90 per cent of those sought.
Everyone else will get all the shares for which they applied.
Only about 10 per cent of applications were for more than 1,500 shares,
advisers said.
A family company of Mr Robert Maxwell, chairman of Mirror Group Newspapers,
has disposed of 49 per cent of the shares in MGN through the UK public offer
and an accompanying Pounds 98m international placing.
Attention will now focus on how the shares, offered at 125p each, will
perform when they make their debut on the stock market next Friday, two
working days earlier than originally scheduled.
Share certificates are due to be posted next Thursday.
