FT  10 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
CONTINUED speculation about a big rights issue, coupled with a poor outlook
for the UK economy, led to consistent selling in the futures, writes Joel
kibazo.
Signs of what lay in store for the rest of the session were much in evidence
when trading in the March contract on the FT-SE opened 5 points below
Monday's close of 2,874.
Independent traders started selling the contract right at the start of
business as the talk of an impending rights issue intensified. They were
later joined by two of London's leading securities houses. The continued
weakness of sterling and a mixed set of economic data not only sent March
falling further but also helped to pull the underlying cash market lower.
The afternoon only brought more selling as dealers focused on a poor Wall
Street opening, and the contract fell to the day's low point of 2,813
half-an-hour before the close.
It was then that short covering by several traders led to a turnround in the
fortunes of March and it recovered some of the earlier drop. It ended at
2,833, a fall of 41 from Monday's close. Strong arbitrage activity
throughout the session resulted in good turnover of 12,092 lots.
The traded options saw volume of 35,247 contracts, of which 11,292 were
dealt in the FT-SE 100 option contract and 2,783 lots in the Euro-FT-SE 100
contract. British Steel was the most active stock option.
