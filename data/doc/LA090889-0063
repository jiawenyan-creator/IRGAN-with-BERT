METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN PLEADS GUILTY IN HOUSING SWINDLE 
An Anaheim woman pleaded guilty Thursday to embezzling $83,000 in government 
money intended for poor tenants being displaced from their South Los Angeles 
homes -- a swindle federal prosecutors said illustrates the kind of oversight 
that has mushroomed into the scandal at the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development. 
Juanita Maria Tachvighi, 44, admitted that she stole HUD funds that should have 
been paid to 10 families who were being ousted from their apartments by a 
rehabilitation project, Assistant U.S. Atty. Adam Schiff said. 
Tachvighi, who has agreed to repay the money, pleaded guilty in U.S. District 
Court in Los Angeles to five counts of embezzling federal funds and three 
counts of theft of government property. She faces up to 80 years in prison and 
a $2-million fine. 
Tachvighi had contracted with a Los Angeles County agency to provide relocation 
services for the tenants whose apartment building had been targeted for 
renovation. But between July, 1986, and early 1988, according to Schiff, she 
funneled many of the agency's checks into her own bank account, leaving tenants 
to struggle with debts and higher rents.
