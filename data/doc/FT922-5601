FT  29 MAY 92 / Younger urges split in SE functions
THE LONDON Stock Exchange should separate its commercial and regulatory
activities more sharply to avoid confusing its users, Mr George Younger,
chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, said yesterday.
Mr Younger also called on the exchange to consult its users more actively to
'avoid repeating the mistakes that were made with Big Bang'.
His comments in a speech in Glasgow are the most out-spoken to have come
recently from a senior UK banker. They reflect growing frustration in the
financial community at the exchange's delay in resolving the long-running
internal debate over its future strategy.
Mr Younger pointed to the 'inherent conflict' between the exchange's
commercial ventures, such as its company news service, and its regulatory
functions. They should be separated clearly 'so customers should always know
whether they have an obligation to comply with a Stock Exchange request or
whether they are dealing with the Stock Exchange on a commercial basis'.
Some companies have complained that the exchange has used its position as a
regulator to discourage them from sending price-sensitive announcements to
rival news services, which has been allowed since early this year.
Mr Younger went on to warn that Taurus, the much-delayed paperless
settlement system, although necessary, was likely to be 'an expensive burden
on all concerned'.
Mr Younger, a former Conservative defence secretary, also suggested that
some of the exchange's functions, such as clearance and settlement, would
best be handled by other bodies.
He said: 'There are various other international centres where these are run
by co-operatives, with all interested parties being involved in policy and
operational procedures.'
