PEDESTRIAN DIES AFTER BEING HIT BY CARS ON FREEWAY 
A pedestrian died Monday evening after being struck by several vehicles on the 
Ventura Freeway in Calabasas, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
The accident occurred at 6 p.m. on the eastbound Ventura Freeway east of 
Parkway Calabasas, said CHP Officer Robert Strong. 
The identity of the victim had not been determined because of the battered 
condition of the body. "We assume it was a male," said Capt. Richard Leitch of 
the Los Angeles County Fire Department. 
Witnesses told authorities "they'd seen someone walking along the freeway," 
Leitch said, but investigators found no abandoned car.
