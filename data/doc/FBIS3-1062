  [Text] Springfield, Orange Free State March 17 SAPA -- 
South Africans aiding the Angolan Army in its war against the 
rebel UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola] movement were doing so without the support, assistance 
or approval of the South African Government or defence force, 
Minister of Defence Kobie Coetsee said on Thursday [17 March]. 
"We do not tolerate dogs of war," he told reporters during an 
election campaign swing through the southern Orange Free State. 
  Mr Coetsee was reacting to earlier radio reports which 
quoted 
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi as saying thousands of South African 
troops were aiding Angolan Government troops in the north-east 
of the country. Mr Coetsee said any SADF [South African Defense 
Force] members tendering their services to Angolan Armed Forces 
were in contravention of the Defence Act for showing allegiance 
to a foreign army.
