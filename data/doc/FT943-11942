FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: US defence groups fail to match
market view
Martin Marietta and Loral, two US defence companies, reported markedly
different results for the three months to June, a period in which both were
buoyed by contributions from recent acquisitions.
Martin Marietta failed to meet market expectations with a 31 per cent
advance in net income, to Dollars 162m. Earnings per share of Dollars 1.29,
fully diluted, were ahead of last year's 99 cents but well short of some
market expectations.
Meanwhile, Loral's earnings of 65 cents a share were ahead of last year's 48
cents and above what the market had been looking for.
Martin Marietta's figures in the second quarter were the first to include
contributions from the space systems division of General Dynamics it
acquired in May. Despite this, sales fell 5 per cent from a year before, to
Dollars 2.5bn.
The figures were helped by a Dollars 50m fee paid by Grumman after Northrop,
another defence company, stepped in to upset their planned merger earlier
this year. This was offset in part by a Dollars 37m pre-tax charge for cost
overruns on a jet engine programme.
Loral, meanwhile, reported net income of Dollars 55m on sales of Dollars
1.3bn, compared with Dollars 40m on sales of Dollars 850m a year ago.
Mr Bernard Schwarz, chairman and chief executive, said the company expected
earnings growth for the year as a whole to exceed 20 per cent. The latest
figures showed 'solid programme performance and strong margins,' he said.
