  [Text] The Havana City water company has informed the 
people that because of problems in the water pumping system in 
the Cuatro Caminos supply station, there will be a water 
shortage tomorrow, 18 June, in several municipalities in Havana 
City. 
  Water supply will be suspended from 0600 to 1800 in the 
zones 
of Cotorro, Guanabacoa, and La Habana del Este. The municipality 
of Cotorro, the town of Cuatro Caminos, and its outskirts will 
be affected. In Guanabacoa, the water shortage will affect the 
areas around Monumental Avenue, from the Central Highway to the 
towns of Santa Fe and Bacuranao; and in the municipality of La 
Habana del Este, the localities of Guiteras, Cojimar, and the 
Alamar development zone. 
  The Havana water company apologizes for the problems this 
shortage might cause. It adds that once the repair work is 
finished, the water service will be gradually reestablished.
