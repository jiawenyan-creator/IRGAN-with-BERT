REBOUND? Freedom Bowl ticket sales have declined since 1986 (above) when 
hometown UCLA played. The turnout has been even smaller, for 20% of 
ticketholders typically do not attend. . . . But organizers think the trend 
will be reversed at Saturday's game in Anaheim. About 52,000 tickets had been 
sold, including 10,000 donated to local military bases, and officials say 
game-day sales could bring the game close to a sellout. Bob Schwartz and Len
