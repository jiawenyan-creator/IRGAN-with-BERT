SPIRITUAL BENEFITS 
I fail to understand the logic of the biased headline "Religion is Big Business 
at the Shrine of Lourdes" (Dec. 3), based on the article by Phillippe Naughton. 
I had the privilege of visiting Lourdes twice, spending up to 12 hours a day in 
prayer and public devotions -- even forgoing lunch in order to treasure each 
spiritual moment. 
Pilgrims visiting Lourdes are there for the spiritual benefits. In the 
religious domain of Lourdes, one may obtain blessed candles and mass offerings 
can be made. Neither is obligatory and there are no collections. The church has 
nothing to do with the commercial aspects outside the grotto grounds.
