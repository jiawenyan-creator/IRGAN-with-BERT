  [Text] Over 3 kilos of heroin were seized by police 
yesterday and an Italian arrested. 
  Pasquale Palumbo told customs authorities at the 
Greek-Turkish border that he had nothing to declare. But a 
thorough search of his car revealed a 3.150 kilos of heroin. 
The drugs were discovered packed in 12 small packages and 
hidden in the car's footboards. 
  Four or five grams of hashish were also found in Palumbo's 
pockets. Customs authorities confiscated the drugs and Palumbo 
was taken to Alexandroupoli's court in Thrace.
