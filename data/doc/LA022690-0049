The president of soccer's governing body wants rule changes to accommodate 
television for the 1994 World Cup, the first to be played in the United States. 
Joao Havelange, president of the International Federation of Association 
Football, was quoted Sunday in Rio de Janeiro as saying games should be divided 
into four 25-minute quarters instead of two 45-minute halves to allow more 
commercials.
