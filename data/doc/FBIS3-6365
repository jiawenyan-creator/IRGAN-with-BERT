  [Text] Parti Bersatu Rakyat Sabah [Sabah United People's 
Party], PBRS, which was launched yesterday, has submitted its 
application to join Barisan Nasional [BN or National Front]. 
  It was handed over by Pro-tem President Datuk Joseph Kurup 
to 
BN Chairman Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed at the Prime 
Minister's Office. Kurup told a news conference later that Dr. 
Mahathir gave his support to the application by PBRS. Their 
talks also touched on the position of Datuk Dr. Jeffrey 
Kitingan, the assemblyman for Bingkor, who yesterday was said to 
have backed the formation of PBRS but was reported today to be 
preparing to set up his own party. 
  PBS [Sabah United Party] state assemblymen have, meanwhile, 
indicated that they are to join Barisan Nasional. The deputy 
chief minister of Sabah, Datuk Bernard Dompok, accompanied by 10 
others conveyed a message to Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim when they 
called on the deputy prime minister in Kuala Lumpur this 
afternoon. 
  Speaking to newsmen after the meeting, Datuk Bernard Dompok 
said they have planned to set up a new party which will apply to 
join Barisan Nasional. He also said that he will talk to other 
former PBS leaders, including Datuk Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan about 
the plan.
