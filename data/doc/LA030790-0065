THE TIMES POLL; 
TEMPORARY HALT IN MEDFLY SPRAYING IS WIDELY BACKED 
Most Californians think the Deukmejian Administration should temporarily halt 
the aerial spraying of malathion until more studies can be conducted into 
possible health hazards of the pesticide, according to the Los Angeles Times 
Poll. 
During the moratorium, citizens think, the state should use "safer methods" of 
trying to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly -- presumably by releasing 
larger numbers of sterile Medflies. 
The Times poll represented the first statewide measure of public opinion about 
malathion spraying in Los Angeles and Orange counties. Telephone interviews 
were conducted with 2,058 California adults from Feb. 24 to March 1. The margin 
of error was three percentage points in either direction. 
Asked whether they thought there should be a temporary halt to the Medfly 
spraying or if it should be continued, 57% of those interviewed favored a halt 
-- and 36% said they felt "strongly" about their view. Only 35% believed the 
spraying should continue. The remaining 8% were not sure. 
Even in the Central Valley -- which as the state's biggest producer of crops 
stands to lose the most from a widespread Medfly infestation -- the majority of 
people favored a moratorium. Every region of California, in fact, supported a 
moratorium. Los Angeles County was the most adamant, with 62% demanding a halt 
to the spraying. 
Across the state, a spraying moratorium was supported particularly by political 
liberals, younger people, blacks and Latinos. But business executives were less 
opposed to spraying than the average. And Republicans generally tended to be 
more sympathetic toward the spraying.
