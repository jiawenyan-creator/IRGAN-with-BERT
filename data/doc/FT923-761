FT  26 SEP 92 / Markets: European shares slump
European share prices were hit this week by the continued turmoil in the
currency markets with speculators turning their attention to the French
franc. The Paris market was 2 per cent down on the week and Frankfurt DAX
index fell 4.8 per cent. Shares in Milan, Amsterdam and Brussels also fell
but the worst effects were seen in Sweden, where short term interest rates
are still set at 50 per cent, and the stock market fell by 8 per cent over
the week.
