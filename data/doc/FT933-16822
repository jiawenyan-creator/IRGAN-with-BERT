FT  01 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: US deal boosts Hanson
TURNOVER in Hanson jumped to 21m after the market was enlivened by the news
that the international conglomerate is to acquire Quantum Chemical, the US
Polyethylene and industrial chemicals group, in an agreed Dollars 3.2bn
deal.
Excited market watchers said the move may be the first signs of the return
of big corporate deals after a four year absence. Hanson shares, which had
eased to 222p just before the mid-afternoon announcement, closed 4 ahead at
226 1/2 p.
Hanson is paying Quantum share holders by issuing 42m American Depositary
Receipts(ADRs) and will also assume Dollars 2.5bn of debt, to be refinanced
at lower levels. It later indicated it would be making a saving of Dollars
125m in the first year.
Analysts said the issuing of ADR's will raise the level of US holdings in
Hanson to around 27 per cent. The company has indicated it would like to see
that level at around 50 per cent, as the US contributes around half of the
group's earnings.
Mr Zafar Khan at Strauss Turnbull said: 'This is a very good deal as Hanson
has managed to buy Quantum at the bottom of the cycle and there should be
big gains with the recovery in its markets. What is more, Hanson has the
balance sheet to deal with the huge debt that comes with the acquisition.'
