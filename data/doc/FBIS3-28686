  [Text] Fukuoka, Feb. 9 KYODO -- The head of Japan's most 
powerful business lobby on Wednesday [9 February] called on the 
government to implement sweeping tax reforms. 
  Speaking at a news conference in this southwestern city of 
Kyushu, Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren) said, "the government needs to figure 
out ways, with a public consensus, to secure financial sources 
to cover tax cuts, taking full account of the rapid aging of 
Japanese society." He was referring to the government's 
decision Tuesday to slash income and other taxes worth 5.47 
trillion yen as part of a pump-priming package aimed at lifting 
the flagging economy out of the doldrums. 
  The government is to form a consultative body to discuss the 
funding question for enactment by the end of the year. 
  Hiraiwa sought an early implementation of the 15.25 trillion 
yen economy-boosting package, saying a delay would sap its 
effect on the economy.
