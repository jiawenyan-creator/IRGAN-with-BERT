FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Argentine sale set to raise
Dollars 130m
Argentina is poised to raise more than USDollars 130m with the sale of the
government's remaining minority stake in the semi-privatised electricity
generator, Central Puerto.
Strong demand allowed the government on Monday to raise its maximum price
for the shares by 8 per cent, to Dollars 5.40. However, economy minister Mr
Domingo Cavallo announced on Tuesday that the government would offer its 30
per cent stake at Dollars 5.30 a share.
Mr Cavallo fixed the price slightly below the ceiling in order to attract
longer-term buyers and to deter speculation. However, analysts expect
trading in the Buenos Aires 'grey' market to be fierce, given that the issue
was heavily oversubscribed.
The government sold 60 per cent of Central Puerto for Dollars 92.2m in April
1992 to a consortium led by Chilgener of Chile. The company's employees hold
the remaining 10 per cent.
The next semi-privatised company in line for stock market flotation is
expected to be Central Costanera, a larger generator, which could be ready
for an international offering in December.
The government is expected next year to offer its minority stakes in 10 gas
transport and distribution companies.
Argentina plans to raise Dollars 750m next month from the sale of global
bonds, the proceeds of which will be used to refinance maturing debt.
Officials had earlier indicated that the offering would be around Dollars
500m. Pricing of the bonds should be detailed next month.
