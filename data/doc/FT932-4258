FT  10 JUN 93 / Export shake-up strategy unveiled
EXPORT promoters, strategic alliances, one-stop shops, a list of 80 priority
markets, and 'a strategic reappraisal of how government and the private
sector can work more closely together' are at the heart of the British
Overseas Trade Board's forward plan, David Dodwell writes.
The plan was presented yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary. Defining competitiveness as a matter of 'incremental excellence',
Mr Heseltine pointed to the 'comprehensive deregulation' at the Department
of Trade and Industry that was intended to provide 'the most competitive
climate within which industry can operate'.
The reorganisation involves civil servants taking direct responsibility for
export promotion to specific markets, and an eventual total of 100 'export
promoters' seconded from industry to link small and medium-size companies to
specific markets. The forward plan identifies western Europe, North America,
Japan and the Asia Pacific rim as top priority areas, along with
environmental goods and services.
