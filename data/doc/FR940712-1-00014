<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to supersede two 
existing AD's that require repetitively inspecting the 
universal joints and universal rivets on British 
Aerospace (BAe), Regional Aircraft Limited, HP 137 Mk1, 
Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes, and 
replacing any damaged part, and limiting the in-service 
life of the torque tube shaft assembly. Jetstream 
Aircraft Limited has introduced an improved flap torque 
shaft assembly that includes universal joints that are 
not life limited. The Federal Aviation 
Administration's policy on aging 
commuter-class aircraft is to eliminate or, in certain 
instances, reduce the number of certain repetitive 
short-interval inspections when improved parts or 
modifications are available. The proposed action would 
require installing this improved flap torque shaft 
assembly in place of the repetitive inspection and life 
limit requirements of the two existing AD's. The 
actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to 
prevent failure of the flap torque shaft assembly, 
which could result in asymmetric flap deployment and 
loss of control of the airplane.
