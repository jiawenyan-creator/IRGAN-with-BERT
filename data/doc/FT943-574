FT  28 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy fall in Sharelink
Lingering worries that the recent poor performances and extreme turbulence
in bond and equity markets could have taken a heavy toll on dealing profits
around the trading desks of the City's merchant and clearing banks suddenly
increased after Sharelink, the Birmingham-based stockbroker, warned that it
would make a Pounds 500,000 interim loss.
Sharelink plunged 51 to an all-time low of 187p - compared with a peak 434p
reached in November last year - following the warning of the loss, which it
said was caused by expenditure on development projects. More worrying for
market analysts was news that low UK market volumes throughout the first six
months of the financial year had caused Sharelink to trade at below break
even for the first third of the year. But the company said it expected to
make operating profits of Pounds 200,000 for the first half.
The Sharelink news caused ripples of selling among other stocks involved in
market trading activities. Smith New Court, London's leading marketmaking
firm, retreated 14 to 400p.
Merchant banks were affected by a bearish research note published by NatWest
Securities which took the view that the market is expecting too much in
terms of mergers and acquisition activity.
Mr Stephen Kirk, NatWest Securities' merchant banks analyst, said: 'Future
profits are likely to disappoint and we retain our negative stance on the
sector.' Schroders, which dropped 30 to 1403p, is NatWest's only straight
sell in the sector, although it recommended reducing holdings in Kleinwort
Benson, marginally firmer at 467p, and Hambros, a penny easier at 268p.
