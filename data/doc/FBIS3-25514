  [Text] Harare -- A row between farming neighbours, one 
black and the rest white, has led to a scathing attack by 
President Robert Mugabe on whites in Zimbabwe, whom he has 
accused of still practising racism. Mugabe, who went to the 
Marondera area to tour a black-owned commercial farm, reminded 
whites that they must accept the reality of defeat or else the 
government would take "appropriate measures." These are taken 
to mean appropriation of their land. Mugabe, noting that some 
white farmers had provided decent accommodation and conditions 
of services for their labourers, said thousands of farmworkers 
were still living in squalor. He accused racial bigots of 
practising slavery. He said the process of acquiring land for 
black resettlement had not really started, but added that land 
redistribution was not meant to deprive white farmers of all 
their land. 
  The lone black large-scale farmer complained that his white 
neighbours were hostile and that they alleged a dam on his 
property had not been built properly
