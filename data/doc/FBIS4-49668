  [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- China's Minister of 
Justice Xiao Yang said here today that China is aiming to bring 
its law business in line with international practices in a short 
period of time. 
  Addressing the '94 China International Business Law Seminar, 
Xiao pointed out that in the near future, China should develop 
more self- disciplined law offices, loosen the restrictions on 
such offices, and gradually turn them into independent corporate 
bodies. 
  He also called for establishing a new regulatory system, 
under which legal associations can play a major role in legal 
business management, and leave the justice administrative 
departments to conduct macro-control. 
  About 100 experts from China, France, Germany, Italy, the 
United States, Macao and Taiwan attended the two-day seminar. 
  They will exchange opinions on foreign-related tax laws, 
corporate law, investment law, intellectual property law and new 
trends for worldwide legal business.
