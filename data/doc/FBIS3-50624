  [Excerpts] Asked about the impact on the members of the 
Armed Forces of having a civilian as their commander in chief, 
General Lino Cesar Oviedo said: "If we remain within that 
command, it is because we are happy and content; otherwise we 
would ask for retirement." 
  Gen. Oviedo, who is the Army commander, pointed out that an 
officer who is part of the organization (referring to the Armed 
Forces) accepts being there because he is satisfied and content. 
[passage omitted] 
  Asked if he continues firm in his loyalty to President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy, Oviedo said that should be taken for granted. 
  Oviedo added: "If we are under his command, we have no other 
alternative. All those under his command are loyal to him. The 
rules of the game ask for absolute loyalty, respect for the 
Constitution and the laws." [passage omitted]
