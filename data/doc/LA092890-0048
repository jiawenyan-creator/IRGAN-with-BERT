YOM KIPPUR 
The most solemn day on the Jewish calendar is Yom Kippur (yome kih-POOR). The 
Day of Atonement, which will be observed this year from sundown today to 
sundown Saturday, concludes the 10 High Holy Days of self-scrutiny and 
repentance. 
* TRADITION: According to rabbinical accounts, it is the day on which Moses 
came down from Mt. Sinai with the second set of Commandment tablets and 
announced God's pardon of the people for worshiping a golden calf. Mentioned in 
the biblical book of Leviticus (23:26-32) along with other holy days, Yom 
Kippur has come to be observed as a day of fasting, rest, meditation and prayer 
for God's forgiveness. 
* OBSERVANCES: Religious Jews will excuse themselves from their workplaces 
during the 24-hour period of Yom Kippur. Synagogue services tonight will 
feature the Kol Nidre recitations, which start with the cancellation of all 
unfulfilled promises to God made rashly or unwittingly during the previous 
year. Synagogues will be at their fullest for a series of daytime services 
Saturday; members have made their reservations far in advance, but some temples 
will have unassigned seating. Rites end with the sounding of the shofar, a 
ram's horn, and the traditional prayer, "Next year in Jerusalem."
