FT  15 JUN 92 / Observer: Over-fished
There can be few banking names in the City which have the same mystique as
that of Glyn, Mills &amp; Co.
It disappeared inside the Royal Bank of Scotland empire a long time ago, but
its reputation as a breeding ground for future bank chairmen lingers on.
Perhaps it is no great surprise then that the dear old TSB should recruit a
new chairman for its loss-making Hill Samuel merchant bank from the Glyn,
Mills stable. John Sclater, who is relieving TSB chief executive Don
McCrickard at the Hill Samuel helm, is the latest in a long line of bankers
who passed their institute exams at Glyn, Mills.
He is in good company. Sir Jeremy Morse, the current chairman of Lloyds
Bank, and Sir Eric Faulkner, his immediate predecessor, both came from Glyn,
Mills, and both did a good job in their subsequent careers. Even so, there
is a danger that Sclater's appointment may look a bit incestuous.
After all, Sir Richard Lloyd, who chaired Hill Samuel before McCrickard took
over in March 1991, is another old Glyn Mills' cadet. Meanwhile students of
the City's old boy network will note that Sclater was appointed to the board
of Union Discount by Alex Ritchie, another ex-Glyn Mills man, who used to
head Grindlays with Nigel Robson, who just happens to sit on the TSB board.
Doubtless, they are all first rate chaps, but if the TSB really wants to
strengthen the management of its wayward merchant bank, it could do worse
than start fishing in less well-trawled waters.
