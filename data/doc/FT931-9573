FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Fiat-Impresit to take large
holding in Lain
FIAT-IMPRESIT, the construction and civil engineering arm of Fiat, is
reorganising its operations in Spain in a complex deal that could represent
a partial disinvestment from its Spanish activities.
Fiat-Impresit is buying a substantial stake in Construcciones Lain, one of
Spain's 10 biggest building concerns. The holding, to be taken through a
capital increase by Lain, will be 'significant, but not controlling', Fiat
said. Lain is understood to have bought Fiat-Impresit's 33 per cent share in
Hasa, the parent company of one of Spain's largest construction groups,
Huarte, yesterday.
The operation would appear to release cash for Fiat-Impresit, which is
selling a substantial stake in a large company for at most a similar-sized
participation in a smaller one.
Fiat said the deal was designed to increase co-operation between
Fiat-Impresit and Lain in the established construction business.
Fiat-Impresit will take its stake in Lain via a Pta5.4bn (Dollars 46m)
capital increase by the Spanish company. Fiat will make a public tender
offer of Pta10 each for share rights linked to the transaction.
