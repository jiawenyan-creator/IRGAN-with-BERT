FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz silent on
controversy
DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's largest industrial company, yesterday refused to be
drawn into the controversy generated by remarks from a board director of the
Deutsche Bank.
Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, director of the Deutsche Bank responsible for corporate
finance, on Wednesday said both groups wanted to see Deutsche's stake in
Daimler reduced from the current level of 28 per cent.
Daimler said yesterday that Mr Edzard Reuter, chief executive, had held
discussions with Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's chief executive and his
predecessor, Mr Alfred Herrhausen, over the level of the holding. But
Daimler insisted that there were no talks on the issue and no plans for the
stake to be cut.
Mr Schmitz told investors on Wednesday that 'there are those in the bank who
may feel sorry not to have got out (of Daimler-Benz shares) when the price
was better'. 'There is a consensus within the bank and Daimler Benz that it
is in the interests of both entities that the stake does not remain at 28
per cent for too long'.
Although Mr Schmitz said there were no immediate plans to cut the stake, the
report of his comments triggered a fall in Daimler's share price by DM8.10
to DM606.20. It recovered after Deutsche Bank put out a statement repeating
that there was no intention to sell the stake and Mr Schmitz's remarks had
been misinterpreted, closing at DM613.50.
