FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: Red Baron's descendant does
battle at FO
Mr Hermann von Richthofen, Germany's ambassador to the UK, is an unfailingly
polite figure with an affection for most things British, writes David Marsh.
A distant relative of the Red Baron, the celebrated first world war fighter
ace, he enjoys relating accounts of his visit to an Oxford men's outfitters
where the owner insisted that his ancestor still owed money from a
long-forgotten clothing bill.
Mr von Richthofen's civilised manner and his experience - he was the German
Foreign Ministry's political director before he took up his London post -
have stood him in exemplary stead on the diplomatic circuit. He has been a
persistent advocate of the German government's proclaimed ambition of
forging European unity - above all, to prevent further fragmentation and
decline in the east.
His diplomatic mildness has not always endeared him to his ultimate master,
the rough-and-ready Chancellor Helmut Kohl. But Mr von Richthofen has
arguably been the best possible choice to represent united Germany on the UK
stage. He has been on particularly active duty during the past two years
trying to correct British prejudices about a resurgent united Germany.
Privately, he remains surprised by the ease with which anti-German
resentment flows to the surface of British politics and the media. He cannot
have enjoyed being called in by the Foreign Office yesterday to hear the
British government's concern at the embassy's 'deliberate decision' to
release Mr Schlesinger's document.
Mr von Richthofen, however, realises that politics demands an element of
play-acting. Even now that he has been told of Whitehall's displeasure,
neither his elegance nor his composure is likely to be too sorely ruffled.
