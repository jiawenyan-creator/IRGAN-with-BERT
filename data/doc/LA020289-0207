U.S. CAPTURES FIRST ALPINE GOLD 
Californian Tamara McKinney gave the United States the first gold medal awarded 
at the World Alpine Ski Championships, recording a respectable third-place 
finish in the downhill today to win the women's combined title. 
McKinney, who had been second in Sunday's combined slalom behind Swiss 
superstar Vreni Schneider, overtook Schneider with a surprisingly competent 
downhill, which is not her specialty.
