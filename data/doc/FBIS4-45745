6513]: "Chengdu Using Microorganisms To Treat Heavy-Metal 
Wastewater"] 
  [Text] Experts in the Chinese Academy of Sciences Biology 
Institute have developed the first successful new method for 
using microorganisms to treat industrial wastewater that 
contains chromium and other heavy metals. In actual use in a 
demonstration project using microorganisms to treat wastewater 
from electroplating at Jingjiang Electric Motor Plant, they have 
obtained excellent results in purifying wastewater and 
recovering heavy metals. Now, this project, which is a project 
to attack key problems in the State Science and Technology 
Commission's Eighth five-Year Plan, has passed examination and 
acceptance by experts in Chengdu directed by the Chinese Academy 
of Sciences. 
  In use, this method mixes selected excellent quality and 
high 
efficiency bacteria with heavy-metal wastewater that absorb 
water like a piece of bread and cause the heavy metals to 
precipitate at the bottom of the tanks. Inspection by 
environmental protection departments indicates that the rate of 
removing heavy metals from wastewater is as high as 99.7 
percent, with a heavy metal recovery rate of more than 80 
percent without causing secondary contamination. The treated 
water completely conforms to the discharge standards stipulated 
by the state.
