WORLD; 
MAN SHOOTS 2 AT SCHOOL, KILLS SELF 
A young man opened fire on a brother and sister today in a courtyard of a high 
school in this Paris suburb, seriously wounding both of them and then killing 
himself, officials said. 
Samir Doulim shot Abil Jbali and Jbali's half-sister Ilham Jbali, before 
turning his pistol on himself, assistant prosecutor Michele Requin said. The 
brother and sister, both in their 20s, were rushed from Paul Langevin Lycee to 
two Paris hospitals. 
All three victims are of Moroccan origin. There were reports that Doulim was 
related to the Jbalis, but the reports could not be confirmed by officials.
