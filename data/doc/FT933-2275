FT  20 SEP 93 / Birt defends BBC licence fee
THE BBC has gone on the offensive to try to defend the value of its licence
fee, which raises about Pounds 1.5bn a year.
Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, speaking at the Cambridge Convention of
the Royal Television Society at the weekend, called on the government to
preserve the value of the licence fee and continue to link it to the retail
prices index.
The government is expected to decide in November on the level of the
licence, currently Pounds 83 for a colour television, for the last three
years of the BBC's present royal charter.
'I don't believe that the organisation can sensibly be pushed further,' Mr
Birt said. In addition to Pounds 100m savings this financial year, savings
of Pounds 50m were planned for next year and Pounds 25m the year after. 'The
time will come - and it's not too far away - when major efficiency savings
on the BBC are no longer possible. At that point preserving, let alone
developing, our programme services will be at an end, unless there is a real
increase in the licence fee.'
At the convention Mr Leslie Hill, chairman and chief executive of Central
Independent Television, re-opened the issue of changes in ownership in ITV -
a possibility being considered by the government.
Without relaxation of the rules that prevent any of the nine largest ITV
companies taking each other over, British commercial television would be
increasingly dominated by US, continental European and possibly Japanese
companies.
