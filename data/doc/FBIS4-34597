  [Text] The National Defense Secretariat has denied that it 
is contemplating the purchase of three AH-15 [as heard] Super 
Cobra attack helicopters, as was reported Thursday in Washington. 
  In a two-paragraph communique, the Defense Secretariat noted 
that it has not taken any official steps to obtain such military 
equipment. U.S. officials had said that Washington had not 
approved the request for the acquisition of such armaments, 
considering the arrival of the equipment as untimely in view of 
the current situation in Mexico. 
  The Defense Secretariat said the Army and Air Force's 
modernization plans do not contemplate the purchase of this type 
of equipment and that no efforts to this effect have been made 
with the U.S. Government.
