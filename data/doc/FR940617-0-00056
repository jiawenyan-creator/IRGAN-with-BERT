<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the regulations for delegations of authority relating to general
redelegations of authority from the Associate Commissioner of Regulatory Affairs to certain FDA officials in the
Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). The redelegation provides these officials with authority to
grant or deny certain citizen petitions for exemption or variance from medical device tracking requirements. This
action is being taken to facilitate expeditious handling of citizen petitions. FDA is also issuing a conforming amendment
to the medical device tracking regulations to make the regulations consistent.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA is amending the regulations in 5.31 

Petitions under part 10

 (21 CFR 5.31) by granting the authority to the Director and Deputy Directors, CDRH, and the Director, Office of Compliance
(previously known as the Office of Compliance and Surveillance), CDRH, to issue responses to citizen petitions submitted
in accordance with 10.30 and 821.2(b) (21 CFR 10.30 and 821.2(b)) requesting an exemption or variance
from the provisions of part 821 concerning medical device tracking requirements. FDA is making a conforming amendment
to 821.2(b), which currently lists only the Director, Office of Compliance and Surveillance, CDRH, as authorized
to issue such responses, to add the Director and Deputy Directors, CDRH. 


Further redelegation of the authority delegated is not authorized. Authority delegated to a position by title may
be exercised by a person officially designated to serve in such position in an acting capacity or on a temporary basis.
This document is issued as a final rule because the rulemaking requirements in 5 U.S.C. 553 do not apply to rules of agency
organization, procedure, or practice.
