  [Text] Kerkyra (Corfu), 23 Jun -- As soon as Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin arrived on the Greek island of Kerkyra 
(Corfu) today, he told journalists at the airport that he was in 
a good and well- disposed mood. 
  Answering a question from ITAR-TASS about the significance 
of 
the forthcoming signing of an agreement on partnership and 
cooperation between Russia and the European Union, Yeltsin 
stressed that this document "signifies the unblocking of 
Russia." He noted that there really had been discrimination 
against Russia, and Europe would be the first to "unblock this 
situation." 
  The Russian president recalled with regret that the United 
States' discriminatory measures against Russia were still in 
force. Among other things, the so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment 
still applies.
