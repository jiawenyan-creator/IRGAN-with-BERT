 

(g) Geographic area of applicability; 

(h) Monitoring requirements and responsibilities;

(i) Remedial action responsibilities including funding; and 

(j) Provisions for protecting the mitigation bank in perpetuity.




Agency participation in a wetlands mitigation banking agreement may not, in any way, restrict or limit the authorities
and responsibilities of the agencies. 



7. An appropriate methodology, acceptable to all signatories, should be identified and used to evaluate the success
of wetland restoration and creation efforts within the mitigation bank and to identify the appropriate stage of development
for issuing mitigation credits. A full range of wetland functions should be assessed. Functional evaluations of
the mitigation bank should generally be conducted by a multi-disciplinary team representing involved resource
and regulatory agencies and other appropriate parties. The same methodology should be used to determine the functions
and values of both credits and debits. As an alternative, credits and debits can be based on acres of various types of
wetlands (e.g., National Wetland Inventory classes). Final determinations regarding debits and credits will be
made by the Corps, or other appropriate permitting agency, in consultation with Federal resource agencies. 

8. Permit applicants may draw upon the available credits of a third party mitigation bank (i.e., a bank developed and
operated by an entity other than the permit applicant). The section 404 permit, however, must state explicitly that
the permittee remains responsible for ensuring that the mitigation requirements are satisfied. 

9. To ensure legal enforceability of the mitigation conditions, use of mitigation bank credits must be conditioned
in the section 404 permit by referencing the banking agreement or section 404 permit establishing the bank; however,
such a provision should not limit the responsibility of the section 404 permittee for satisfying all legal requirements
of the permit.

Regulatory Guidance Letter (RGL 933)



RGL 933

Issued: September 13, 1993, Expires: not applicable



Subject: 

Rescission of Regulatory Guidance Letters (RGL) 905, 907, and 908




1. On 25 August 1993 the final ``Excavation Rule'' was published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 45008) and becomes effective on 24 September 1993. This regulation modifies the definition of ``Discharge
of Dredged Material'' to address landclearing activities (see 33 CFR 323.2(d)); modifies the definitions of ``Fill
Material'' and ``Discharge of Fill Material'' to address the placement of pilings (see 33 CFR 323.2(e) and (f) and
323.3(c)); and modifies the definition of ``waters of the United States'' to address prior converted cropland (see
33 CFR 328.(a)(8)). 

2. Therefore, RGL 905, Subject: ``Landclearing Activities Subject to Section 404 Jurisdiction''; RGL 907,
Subject: ``Clarification of the Phrase `Normal Circumstances' as it pertains to Cropped Wetlands''; and RGL 908,
Subject: ``Applicability of section 404 to Pilings''; are hereby rescinded effective 24 September 1993. Furthermore,
although RGL 905, Subject: ``Landclearing Activities Subject to section 404 Jurisdiction'' expired on 31
December 1992 it should continue to be applied until 24 September 1993. 

3. In addition, RGL's 905, 907, and 908 as of 24 September 1993 will no longer be used for guidance
since the guidance contained in those RGL's has been superseded by the regulation.
