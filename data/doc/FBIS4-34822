  [Text] The Democratic Left party is requesting a sincere 
dialogue between Indians and the government. The Democratic Left 
has criticized the government and the Social Christian Party on 
the agrarian law. The Democratic Left says the country currently 
is in a situation of increasing violence, which leads to a 
delicate security situation. The Democratic Left says that the 
agrarian law should be repealed in order to pave the way for a 
sincere dialogue. 
  [Begin recording of unidentified speaker] I want to say that 
the Democratic Left warned well in advance of the danger of 
imposing on the Indians, who are our fellow countrymen, a bill 
benefiting the traditionally privileged groups, who are 
represented in this case by Agriculture Minister Mariano 
Gonzalez. We think it is time for the government to seriously 
consider the measures it has adopted and to find adequate 
channels for restoring tranquillity in the country. [end

  The Democratic Left has stated its support of the 
Confederation of Indian Nationaliaties of Ecuador. It does not 
agree, however, with the violence and acts of vandalism promoted 
by some Indians in the Ecuadoran mountain provinces.
