FT  12 SEP 92 / Nalgo workers resume strike after court victory
WORKERS at Newham Council in London went back on strike yesterday after
their union won its appeal against a High Court order to call off the
industrial action.
The legal move was the first by a Labour-led council against a trade union
using Conservative employment laws. The High Court's order, made earlier
this month, would if upheld have had important implications for what a trade
union could do before a ballot on industrial action.
Mrs Justice Ebsworth, in granting Newham Council an injunction against the
union, said it was 'clearly arguable' that the union promoted the strike
call before the ballot and was in breach of Section 7(3) of the Employment
Act 1990.
The act says there must be no call for or authorisation of action before a
ballot.
Nalgo, the public-services union, had promoted localised strikes against
compulsory redundancies before balloting its whole membership.
Nalgo said the judgment meant that unions would be prevented from balloting
on whether to escalate action during the course of a dispute - an outcome it
said that parliament could never have intended when drafting the act.
Three Court of Appeal judges set aside Mrs Justice Ebsworth's provisional
ruling.
Lord Justice Woolf said Nalgo, while demonstrating that it wanted industrial
action to be extended, was not calling on members to strike.
Workers at Newham decided to renew the indefinite action which has cost
Nalgo more than Pounds 1m in strike pay.
The union was awarded costs for the original High Court action and for the
appeal.
Newham Council was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords, but is
applying to the Law Lords for leave to appeal.
