  [Text] There are 90 Basic Cooperative Production Units 
[UBPC] in Havana Province. Forty-eight of these tend sugarcane, 
29 miscellaneous crops, 10 tobacco, and three specialize in 
citrus. Candido Palmero, first secretary of the Communist Party 
of Cuba [PCC] in Havana, stressed to the plenary of the first 
provincial meeting of UBPC that in this first phase, crop 
tending efforts were better and there was a reduction of 37 
percent in the labor force. Under new concepts, this labor force 
was unnecessary. 
  Participants in the first provincial UBPC meeting are 
discussing -- in six work committees -- problems regarding 
finances, services, and the role the PCC, unions, and officials 
should play. Palmero urged UBPC members to produce for the 
people and not veer from the guidelines drafted by the PCC 
Politburo. 
  [Radio Reloj at 2045 on 21 January adds that the main goal 
of 
the meeting is to discuss positive and negative trends seen to 
date and that the sugar and agriculture ministers are in 
attendance, as are Politburo members Jose Ramon Machado Ventura 
and Carlos Lage.]
