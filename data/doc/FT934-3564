FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: 3i demonstrates 'robust portfolio' with 10%
rise
3i, the UK's largest investment capital provider, yesterday reported a 10
per cent increase in net assets to 618p per share in the six months to
September 30.
Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive, said the improvement demonstrated 3i
had a 'robust underlying portfolio' and provided a 'strong indication of the
financial performance of the sector in which we operate'.
The group is to pay an interim dividend of 4.7p (3.3p) to its shareholders,
the UK clearing banks and the Bank of England. The 42 per cent rise brings
the interim back in line with recent increases in the final dividend which
have not been matched at the interim stage, the group said.
The total return - a combination of dividend revenue less costs and net
interest, realised investment profits and the appreciation of the unrealised
portfolio - was Pounds 151m compared with a fall of Pounds 73.8m in the
first half of 1992.
Pre-tax revenue rose from Pounds 18.8m to Pounds 37.6m helped by a swing in
the interest line from a net charge of Pounds 11.3m to a Pounds 2.4m credit.
Two indications of the improved welfare of the smaller companies that 3i
serves came from the dividend earned figure and the level of provisions.
Dividend income rose from Pounds 44.4m to Pounds 51.4m and net provisions
fell from Pounds 46.9m to Pounds 19.2m. Mr Larcombe said the lower
provisions level showed 'the underlying portfolio is no longer
deteriorating.'
Within the total return, revenue rose from Pounds 16m to Pounds 28.2m,
partly reflecting the recovery in dividends, but also a reduced interest
bill as the flow of new investments slowed. Mr Brian Larcombe, finance
director, said the deal flow had begun to pick up again four months ago.
The group made after tax realised investment profits of Pounds 30.6m,
compared with losses of Pounds 16.2m including provisions, in the first half
last year. This equated to realisation profit over cost of Pounds 62.1m,
against Pounds 35.8m in the comparable period of 1992.
3i invested Pounds 138m in 264 investments in the period, compared with
Pounds 200m in 414 projects in the first half of last year.
Shareholders' funds were up from Pounds 1.19bn to Pounds 1.48bn.
