FT  11 MAR 94 / Nigeria postpones political reforms
Nigeria's military regime has postponed indefinitely the national
constitutional conference, scheduled for early this year, Paul Adams writes
from Lagos.
It was to be the basis for a political reform programme promised by General
Sani Abacha when he seized power last November. A commission set up nearly
two months ago to organise the conference sent a preliminary report this
week to the head of state which contained only one specific recommendation:
to hasten the building of accommodation for the delegates in the capital
Abuja.
