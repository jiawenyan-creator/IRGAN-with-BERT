  [Excerpts] Ba'labakk, Lebanon, June 9 (AFP) -- Pro-Iranian 
Hizballah guerrillas released six Lebanese men and a retired 
Syrian soldier hours after kidnapping them in Syrian-controlled 
eastern Lebanon, Syrian military officials said Thursday. 
  They were freed overnight Wednesday after the Syrian 
military 
command in the al-Biqa' Valley threatened to arrest Hizballah 
militants in retaliation, the officials said. 
  The men were seized in the Ba'labakk region after three of 
them were seen taking photographs outside the home of 
Hizballah's former secretary general Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli. 
  Two of the men were identified as Lebanese expatriates who 
had returned to their home villages after long stays in the Gulf 
state of Qatar and the United States. [passage omitted] 
  Moslem fundamentalist leaders have charged that the 
commandos 
were assisted by local accomplices. 
  Hizballah has been on alert since June 2 when Israeli 
warplanes killed 32 guerrilla trainees on a base near Ba'labakk.
