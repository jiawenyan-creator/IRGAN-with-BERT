FT  18 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics in Brief
TRADE: Britain's financial-services sector should be one of the main
beneficiaries from the new agreement between the European Community and the
European Free Trade Association, Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, told the
Commons last night.
He envisaged that the agreement would lead to 'significant economic gains'
for industry and consumers. There would be free movement of capital,
services, goods and people.
Welcoming the agreement, Ms Joyce Quin, Labour trade spokeswoman, emphasised
that the parties to the agreement should seek to promote world trade as a
whole and to dispel ideas of a 'fortress Europe'.

Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, said the use of the guillotine was
necessary because of Labour 'filibustering' in committee stages.
