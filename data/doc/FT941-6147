FT  03 MAR 94 / Vosper in talks with Swans' receivers
Vosper Thornycroft, the Southampton-based shipbuilding and engineering
group, confirmed yesterday that it is in talks with the receivers of Swan
Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder.
Mr Martin Jay, Vosper's managing director, said the discussions with
receivers Price Waterhouse were 'exploratory and tentative at this stage'.
He declined to give details of his company's intentions towards Swan Hunter,
in receivership since last May, or to say whether it had been spurred into
discussions by a likely bid for Swans from Vosper's French rival,
Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie. Teams from Vosper and CMN have been
at Swan's Wallsend premises this week.
Swan Hunter union leaders were yesterday uneasy about Vosper's apparent
interest. 'Our concern would be that they've come in to delay the situation
with regard to CMN, and in doing so CMN may very well canter on somewhere
else,' said Mr Dick Gonzalez, leader of the Confederation of Shipbuilding
and Engineering Unions at Swans.
Last summer, responding to a letter from Swans' unions, Mr Jay wrote that
his company had spare capacity at its yards on the south coast and therefore
no interest in the purchase of Swan Hunter.
Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle East, said yesterday that Vosper
could now have sound commercial reasons for acquiring Swan Hunter, which has
slimmed since receivership from nearly 2,500 employees to 1,038. But, he
added, Vosper might be only interested in Swans' intellectual property.
Vosper, with cash reserves of about Pounds 60m and a Pounds 600m order book,
exports 95 per cent of its output. It has strong overseas order prospects,
including eight patrol boats for Kuwait, for which it is competing against
CMN and German-owned Lurssen.
