  [Text] President Francois Mitterrand received the 
delegations to the Conference on Stability in Europe at the 
Elysee Palace this evening. During his speech, the president 
pleaded for the creation of institutions capable of promoting 
peace and anticipating conflicts in the old continent. 
  [Begin recording] [Mitterrand] The system relies on the good 
will of states. A strong desire for bilateral or, if necessary, 
multilateral agreements is therefore necessary among countries 
which for centuries have been used to fighting each other, and 
which run the risk of seeing the unbearable order which reigned 
across Europe for so long replaced by a disorder which would 
soon be equally unbearable. 
  As no one wishes to impose his way, one must resort to the 
old principles of every civil, even civilized society, which are 
those of mutual consent. We must resort to dialogue, to 
negotiation, to treaties, to pacts, and to contracts. [end
