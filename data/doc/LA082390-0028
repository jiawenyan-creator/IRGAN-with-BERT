L.A. COUNTY REDISTRICTING PUT ON HOLD 
There was only one major flaw in your editorial "Slow Down and Get It Right" 
(Aug. 18) regarding the redistricting for the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors. 
The three-man conservative majority on the board is not now nor has it ever 
been ready to reach a settlement. 
It is content to squander millions of taxpayer dollars on this and other 
lawsuits. It has an unlimited fund of money (the taxpayers), so why not? If 
these men had to use their own personal funds, they would be reasonable and try 
to reach an equitable settlement. 
Those millions of dollars belong to the people of Los Angeles County and should 
have been used to promote the people's welfare, education and mental 
well-being. Five supervisors for a county the size of Los Angeles is absurd. 
The Los Angeles City Council has more members.
