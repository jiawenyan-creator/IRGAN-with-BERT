  [Text] Kiev, 27 May -- Ukrainian Presidential Aide Nikolay 
Mikhalchenko has denied Russian media reports about a statement 
he is supposed to have made on the possibility of introducing 
presidential rule to Crimea. In an exclusive interview with 
ITAR-TASS today, he said that on 31 May, the Ukrainian Supreme 
Soviet may resume debating the Crimean question as the 10-day 
deadline for bringing the Crimean constitution into line with 
that of Ukraine, as set by the Ukrainian Parliament, is running 
out. 
  "It is impossible to predict today what decisions the 
Supreme 
Soviet will take or to talk about specific steps," Nikolay 
Mikhalchenko said. At the same time, he added that "Ukrainian 
legislature does not provide for introducing presidential rule. 
Therefore, anyone who talks about it is deliberately tricking 
the public."
