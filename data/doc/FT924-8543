First Leisure, which runs attractions ranging from the Blackpool Tower to
ten-pin bowling centres, snooker clubs and discotheques, has appointed a
marketing director with a background in advertising, video rental and music
sales.
Mark Nicholls, 35, was previously UK marketing and programming director at
Blockbuster, the biggest US video rental company. Blockbuster this year
became the biggest video rental company in the UK when it bought Cityvision,
operators of the Ritz chain. Earlier jobs included head of marketing at
Virgin Retail, and seven years in advertising, where clients included Forte,
Citroen, Mitsubishi, McDonald's and Greenpeace.
John Conlan, First Leisure's chief executive, said Nicholls' Virgin and
Blockbuster experience would stand him in good stead: 'We are essentially in
the business of retailing entertainment.'
