  [Text] Japan and the United States ended two days of 
negotiations on the insurance sector at the economic framework 
talks on 2 June. While the two governments have refused to 
disclose details of the discussions, they seem to have failed to 
reach agreement on what should be used as objective criteria to 
gauge the openness of the market in the insurance sector, and 
special consideration for foreign insurance companies in 
relation to deregulation measures on the "third sector" 
insurance covering injury, nursing services, and so forth. The 
two countries will resume negotiations in Tokyo before the end 
of June, and are expected to start working on the wording of the 
agreement in the next round of talks. However, a final 
agreement may still take some time. 
  According to the Ministry of Finance, discussions in the 
past 
two days confirmed points of agreement reached as of last 
February, and the Japanese negotiating team explained the main 
points of the ongoing process of amending the Insurance Business 
Act to pave the way for insurance system reform. 
  Regarding objective criteria and problems related to the 
third sector insurance, both sides limited themselves to an 
affirmation of their basic positions. "Concrete issues were not 
discussed," (according to a senior Finance Ministry official). 
The United States did not present any new demands during the 
discussions either. 
  The U.S. side also agrees that "there is still a lot of work 
to do before an agreement can be reached," (according to a 
Department of Commerce official). There is a possibility that 
the negotiations may experience rough sailing on the issue of 
objective criteria.
