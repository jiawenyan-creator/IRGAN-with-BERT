FT  07 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Bromsgrove may launch offer for GW Thornton
BROMSGROVE Industries, the Birmingham-based specialist engineering
conglomerate, yesterday looked to be about to make an agreed bid for GW
Thornton, the Sheffield-based engineering company.
Both companies asked for their shares to be suspended, Bromsgrove 'pending
an announcement' and Thornton because of discussions which may lead to a
bid.
Bromsgrove shares were unchanged on the Friday close at 131p for a
capitalisation of Pounds 56.5m. Thornton's suspension price of 150p, again
unchanged, valued the company at Pounds 9.9m.
If the deal goes ahead, it will be Bromsgrove's second acquisition in a
month. During December it made a Pounds 2.8m cash and shares takeover of
Imbach Group, taking it into environmental engineering.
Thornton's main business is precision forgings for the aerospace industry, a
neat fit with Bromsgrove's existing aerospace engineering interests.
Bromsgrove, in its half year to last September, and Thornton, in its full
year to September, both managed to increase trading profits in aerospace
markets in spite of a general downturn in the industry.
Thornton has been expanding its interests in the orthopaedic market, a
sector where Bromsgrove has no involvement.
During the year to last September Thornton made pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.6m on turnover of Pounds 12.3m. In the six months to September 30
Bromsgrove reported profits of Pounds 3.5m pre-tax on turnover of Pounds
39.4m.
