U.S. DIPLOMATS IN JORDAN, SUDAN ADVISED TO LEAVE 
The State Department today added Sudan and Jordan to a list of six other Middle 
East and African countries where Americans connected to U.S. embassies are 
being ordered home or permitted to return voluntarily as a result of "unstable 
conditions" related to the Persian Gulf. 
A U.S. official said these conditions have intensified following the decision 
of the U.N. Security Council to set a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraqi troops to 
withdraw from Kuwait. 
All non-essential personnel and dependents of U.S. government personnel are 
being asked to leave Jordan and Sudan "well before the Jan. 15 deadline," the 
announcement said. The State Department also recommended that U.S. citizens 
defer travel to the two countries. 
The decisions concerning the six other countries had been announced earlier. 
Those countries are Yemen, Mauritania, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar 
and Saudi Arabia's Eastern province. 
There has been strong pro-Iraqi sentiment in both Jordan and Sudan. 
The statement indicates concern over the possibility that pro-Iraqi sentiment 
in the eight countries could be directed at U.S. diplomatic offices. Large 
anti-American demonstrations have taken place in the Sudan and Jordan.
