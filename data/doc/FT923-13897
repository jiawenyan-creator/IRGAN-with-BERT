FT  10 JUL 92 / Democrats demand US-Iraq probe
SENIOR Democrats in the US Congress yesterday demanded the appointment of a
special prosecutor to investigate claims that Bush administration officials
had committed crimes in aiding President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, before his
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
The demand for an investigation is likely to prove a political embarrassment
to President George Bush, who has denied any wrong-doing by his
administration.
The request was in a letter from 20 Democratic members of the House
judiciary committee, sent yesterday to Mr William Barr, attorney-general. It
said a special prosecutor should investigate alleged attempts 'to conceal
from Congress information about potential criminal activity'.
Republican members of the committee have accused Democrats of a witch-hunt
against Mr Bush. They say a special prosecutor would be a waste of money.
Mr Jack Brooks, the conservative Texan Democrat who chairs the committee,
denied yesterday that the call for a special prosecutor was related to
electoral politics. He said the request was not an attempt to second-guess
the administration's policy of 'tilting' toward Iraq in its war with Iran in
the 1980s.
