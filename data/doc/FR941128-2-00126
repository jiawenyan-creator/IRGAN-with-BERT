In the matter of TAW29,543 McKenzie, Tennessee, TAW29,544 2660 Oregon St., Oshkosh,
Wisconsin, TAW29,544A 2748 Oregon St., Oshkosh, Wisconsin, TAW29,544B 2728 Oregon
St., Oshkosh, Wisconsin, TAW29,544C 164 W. 28th St., Oshkosh, Wisconsin.




In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on March 29, 1994, applicable to all workers of Oshkosh B'
Gosh's facilities at McKenzie, Tennessee; 2660 Oregon Street and 2748 Oregon Street in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The Notice
was published in the Federal Register on April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17570).

The Department reviewed the certification for the workers of the subject firm. New findings show that two distribution
centers in Oshkosh, Wisconsin (2728 Oregon St and 164 W. 28th Avenue) which handle mostly domestic corporate merchandise
from McKenzie and Camden Tennessee and Oshkosh, Wisconsin closed in September, 1994. The Camden plant was certified
under petition TAW28,622.

The intent of the Department's certification is to handle all workers of Oshkosh B'Gosh who were affected by increased
imports of children's and men's workwear bibs, jackets and jeans. 

The amended notice applicable to TAW29,543 and 29,544 is hereby issued as follows:




All workers of Oshkosh B'Gosh, McKenzie, Tennessee (TAW29,543), who became totally or partially separated
from employment on or after January 31, 1993 and all workers of Oshkosh B'Gosh 2660 Oregon Street (TAW29,544);

(TAW29,544C) in Oshkosh, Wisconsin who become totally or partially separated from employment on or
after February 15, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.
