FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: EIO close to victory in bid for St Andrews
Trust
ECCLESIASTICAL Insurance Office is close to victory in its bid for St Andrew
Trust, the smaller companies' investment trust, despite institutional
opposition to the offer.
At the first closing date last Friday, EIO had acceptances of 7.8 per cent.
Together with its existing stake of 40.27 per cent, that lifts its interest
to 48.07 per cent.
The bid is technical, designed to give EIO a 50 per cent plus stake in St
Andrew so that it can equity account the holding for EC capital adequacy
purposes.
However, institutions such as British American Film Holdings have argued
that the offer, at 93 per cent of formula asset value, does not pay a
sufficient premium for control. 'If EIO wins control, it won't have the same
interest as the rest of the shareholders,' argued Mr Jonathan Woolf of BAFH.
Mr George Prescott of EIO said yesterday: 'We've been associated with the
trust for a number of years. We believe we've always taken the interests of
all shareholders into account.'
The offer has been extended until January 22.
