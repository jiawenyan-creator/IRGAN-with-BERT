  [Text] Army reform "is going tough, lagging behind the 
plans we drew up, but it is still going," Russia's Defence 
Minister Pavel Grachev told Interfax on Wednesday. Yet, he 
stressed that "over almost two years Russia had managed to 
create a strong army," although, by his admittance, not the army 
he dreams about. 
  At this complex time for the Russian army, Grachev remarked, 
about 16,000 Russian servicemen are on peaceful duties in 
Georgia, Moldova, Tajikistan and other countries in CIS and 
elsewhere. 
  He recalled that several days ago Russian troops 
demonstrated 
their power in former Yugoslavia, where they marched along bad 
roads in heavy snow and after covering 500 kilometers ahead of 
time reached Bosnia's capital Sarajevo. 
  "I have met with foreigners in CIS and other countries, and 
I 
can say that they are sympathetic toward our army," the 
minister said. 
  The Army and Navy Day, observed on February 23, is a holiday 
not only for servicemen but for the entire people, Grachev 
stressed. "Those who slander the army are simply ignorant people 
or those who hate not only the army but our Russia," the defence 
minister declared.
