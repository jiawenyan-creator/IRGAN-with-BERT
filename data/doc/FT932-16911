FT  03 APR 93 / Councils may lose control over grants
THE government is planning to strip local councils of their responsibility
for administering mandatory student grants and fees.
Under the new scheme, parents and students would have to apply for grants to
a centralised agency. This agency could be combined with the Student Loans
Company, which runs the government loans system introduced in 1990 to
supplement student maintenance grants.
Over the longer term, some ministers believe the work should be carried out
by the private sector, and combining the administration of student loans and
grants would be the first step. Transferring the task to the private sector
could be achieved by privatising the loans company.
Councils could also lose responsibility for awarding discretionary student
grants, which might be turned into scholarships to be awarded by the
colleges themselves.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, hopes to legislate in the next
parliamentary session, but his bill has not been given a firm place in the
programme. The cabinet, which will decide soon after Easter what bills
should proceed in autumn, wants a legislative programme to unite Tory
backbenchers.
Mr Patten's proposals are strongly backed by the Treasury, which believes
that a centralised agency would provide better value for money.
This decision to remove a further task from local authorities is likely to
undermine the new spirit of co-operation between central and local
government which Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, has been seeking
to promote.
Although councils act only in processing government money under the present
arrangements for mandatory student grants, the move may be seen as a further
blow to the status and role of local authorities.
