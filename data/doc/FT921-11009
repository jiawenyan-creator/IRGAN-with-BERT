FT  03 FEB 92 / Observer: Hog's back
Steel yourselves for another six weeks of winter, warned denizens of
Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, yesterday when Phil the groundhog saw his shadow
as he emerged from his burrow, and went back again.
For long a local hero, the weather-forecasting rodent will soon achieve fame
on the silver screen. Shooting starts next month on 'Groundhog Day', and
Bill Murray, the film's leading (human) actor, showed up at the burrow on
Gobbler's Knob for rehearsal.
