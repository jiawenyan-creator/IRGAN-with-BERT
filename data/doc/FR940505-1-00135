 



EPA is proposing to adopt the enhanced in-use compliance 
program described in Appendix I, Section C. EPA also requests 
comments on all aspects of its proposal and on any other 
approaches to further reduce in-use emissions.

Activities.

 (1) Introduction. The litigation which resulted in today's FIP proposal 
arose at least in part from a feeling in California that the 
emission regulation of certain sources was not keeping pace 
with the attainment needs of California areas or with the 
stringency of control imposed on other sectors of the 
California economy. For today's FIP proposal, EPA is 
proposing controls for these sources, and this section details 
the mixture of new engine standards and innovative market- 
based controls that will be proposed. 

The table below (``1990 Base Year Inventory of National 
Transportation Sources'')
<FOOTCITE>73</FOOTCITE>
 details the level of emissions from 
national transportation sources in each of the FIP inventories 
for the 1990 base year. The information contained in this 
table illustrates that while these sources are not as large as 
other mobile sources, their contribution to the emissions 
inventories warrants control by EPA.

The inventories for locomotives are derived from assuptions made by EPA based on inventories acquired from the Booz-Allen
reports entitled: 

Locomotive Emissions Study

 and
