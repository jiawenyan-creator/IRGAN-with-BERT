FT  13 OCT 94 / Pension growth set to beat price rises
State pensions could be raised next year at a slightly higher level than the
current rate of inflation for pensioners' households, official figures
yesterday indicated.
But family credit, income support and housing benefit are likely be raised
by slightly less than headline inflation.
The government uses September's inflation data each year to calculate the
rate at which some benefits should be raised next April, but employs
slightly different measurements of inflation for others. State pensions,
along with other payments such as unemployment, maternity and sickness
benefits, are raised according to the rate of annual growth in the all-items
retail prices index.
If the chancellor raises them in the November Budget according to
September's rate of inflation, next year's pensions should be raised by 2.2
per cent. This compares with a level of inflation for pensioners' households
of 1.9 per cent in the third quarter.
Rises in family credit, income support and housing benefit are usually
related to a a different index known as ROSSI, excluding rent, mortgage and
council tax, which was 1.8 per cent in September.
