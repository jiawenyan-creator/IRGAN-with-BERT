FT  22 FEB 93 / Police to probe alleged Pounds 6m fraud on Salvation Army
THE METROPOLITAN and City Police Company Fraud Squad is expected to launch a
formal investigation this week into the disappearance of Dollars 8.8m
(Pounds 6.19m) from the Salvation Army.
The inquiries come as investigators continue to search for details of
Islamic Pan American Bank, which is named in a writ issued by the charity as
part of its efforts to recover the missing funds.
The July 1992 edition of the Bankers' Almanac, a standard reference book
published in the UK, says the bank is based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with
nine representative offices around the world. The bank has been under police
investigation since last summer and is on the warning list of the US banking
regulator.
Senior Argentine banking sources said they had never heard of the bank,
which is not registered with the Central Bank of Argentina.
The Bank of England said yesterday that Islamic Pan American Bank does not
have a presence in the UK.
Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, will examine the suggestion in the
almanac that it acts as auditor to the bank. PW says the bank is not a
client of any of its South American member firms.
In a letter to the Financial Times today, the Salvation Army says it has
been advised by its lawyers not to make public any further details of the
circumstances surrounding the alleged fraud.
It has emerged that the officer suspended without pay pending an internal
investigation is Colonel Grenville Burn, a public affairs officer. No
allegations of fraud have been made in connection with him.
