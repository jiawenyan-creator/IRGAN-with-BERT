METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
COUNCIL OKS BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS 
The Long Beach City Council on Tuesday approved an ordinance outlawing the 
local sale of semiautomatic assault weapons, while reaffirming its support of a 
statewide ban on the sale of the military-style guns. 
The measure, which would go into effect a month after its scheduled second 
reading next week, bans the sale of such semiautomatic weapons as the AK-47, 
the AR-15 and the Uzi. Unlike a ban recently adopted in Los Angeles, however, 
it does not make possession of the weapons illegal, prompting several council 
members to concede that the ordinance is weak. They nonetheless argued that it 
was better than nothing and approved it, 8 to 1. Councilman Jeffrey A. Kellogg 
voted against the proposal, saying, "I'm not to support this because the state 
can do it better." 
The ordinance makes it a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail 
and a fine of $1,000, to sell semiautomatic rifles or carbines that accept 
magazines of 20 or more rounds, as well as shotguns that hold more than six 
rounds. 
Since a gunman killed five Stockton schoolchildren with an AK-47 in January, 
several cities in Los Angeles County have passed local assault weapon bans, 
including Los Angeles, Compton, Carson and Lynwood.
