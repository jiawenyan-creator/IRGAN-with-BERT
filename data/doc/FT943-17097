FT  01 JUL 94 / Warning of war in Croatia
A senior US diplomat said yesterday that former Yugoslavia could soon be
engulfed by a renewed war inside Croatia, where a ceasefire between Serbs
and Croats is looking tenuous. The warning was issued by Mr Peter Galbraith,
the US ambassador to Zagreb. He warned that in the event of a renewed war,
the Croatian army could be crushed by better armed and more numerous Serb
fighters who would be backed by Belgrade. 'The danger of a new war remains,'
said Mr Galbraith during a visit to Osijek, north-eastern Croatia.
Complaining about Serb intransigence during peace efforts and the absence of
progress in international mediation, Croat officials are threatening to
seize back nearly one-third of their republic's territory which is under de
facto Serb control. If they fail to gain control over the 'state', which
severs Croatia in half, Croat political and military leaders say they will
not renew the UN mandate. Zagreb says the UN presence has simply frozen Serb
military gains, carved out during the six-month war in 1991, although
diplomats believe the 14,000 strong force has prevented an all-out conflict.
