  [Text] A new search for missing in action [MIA] from the 
Vietnam war began on Thursday with the participation of more 
than 100 American specialists. It is the second biggest search 
since the lifting of the United States trade embargo. 
  They will conduct interviews of local people, and undertake 
excavations in 15 provinces and the three large cities of Hanoi, 
Ho Chi Minh City, and Haiphong. 
  Lieutenant Colonel John Cray, chief of the United States MIA 
Bureau in Hanoi, said that over the past six weeks, American 
specialists visited 10 prisons but did not find any evidence of 
the Americans detained after the war.
