  [Text] China's first artificial island -- the Dagang oil 
field Zhangjuhe artificial island -- recently achieved a 
high-output industrial flow of oil and gas. 
  The Zhangjuhe artificial island is located on the southeast 
coast of the village of Zhangjuhe, Qikou Township, Huanghua 
City, Hebei Province, 4000 meters offshore. The complex is a 
round steel caisson measuring 11 meters in height; it weighs 
more than 700 tons and covers an area of 2,826 square meters. 
The `island' can accommodate 72 wells. The first well began 
drilling in early August 1993. 
  Today, three exploratory wells have been drilled at 
Zhangjuhe 
and one of them -- the Zhanghai 2-1 well -- recently hit a 
high-output industrial oil and gas flow with a daily output of 
1,565 cubic meters of natural gas and 74.74 cubic meters of 
crude oil. 
  The success of the exploratory wells at Zhangjuhe illustrate 
the fact that China has reached a new stage in shallow ocean oil 
exploration.
