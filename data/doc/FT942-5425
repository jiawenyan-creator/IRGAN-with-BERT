FT  04 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities ahead in wake of
jobs data
Wall Street
US share prices pushed ahead yesterday after the release of an ambiguous set
of data on May employment conditions, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.23 higher at 3,772.22, while
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 2.48 at 460.13. Volume
on the NYSE was a moderate 270m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 1.31 better at
441.84, and the Nasdaq composite added 2.88 to 742.38.
The government's report on labour market conditions last month defied easy
interpretation, as did the subsequent reaction of the financial markets.
The headline figure was favourable for investors looking for signs of a
cooling economy and evidence that could delay the Federal Reserve's next
move to tighten interest rates. An increase of 191,000 in non-farm payrolls
was well below the forecasts of analysts, which centred on a gain of
275,000.
But there was bad news, too. The initial estimates of March and April
payrolls were revised upwards, leaving the gain over the three months a
little stronger than expected.
More troubling, the unemployment rate showed a surprising drop to 6.0 per
cent, from 6.4 per cent the previous month. The 6.0 per cent level was
especially worrying, because it is cited by many economists as the effective
point of 'full employment'. It set off alarm bells about the potential for
higher wages as employers compete for scarce workers.
Initially, longer-dated bonds, which are especially sensitive to inflation,
jumped on the payroll data, but quickly reversed direction as traders
digested the rest of the report. By the time equities started trading at
9.30, the long bond was moderately lower, and the Dow fell 15 points.
However, there were more surprises. Minutes after the NYSE's opening, the
long bond began to rally, climbing nearly a point by midday and holding
there. Analysts were at loss to provide an adequate explanation for the
second turnround. Sliding commodity prices provided some support.
Nevertheless, stocks took the bait, shifting direction and pushing securely
into positive ground. The Dow industrials were held back somewhat by General
Motors which sank Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 52 1/2 in brisk trading. The car
maker announced that it would convert an issue of preferred stock into
common shares. International Business Machines, off Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars
61 7/8 , was another drag on the Dow.
Offsetting the declines, 3M added Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 51 3/4 and Sears
put on Dollars 1 to Dollars 51.
In other retailing stocks, Wal-Mart gained Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 23 7/8
after announcing plans to expand into Argentina and Brazil. JC Penney
dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 48 1/4 .
Bausch&amp;Lomb plunged Dollars 8 1/8 , or nearly 20 per cent, to Dollars 41 3/8
.
Canada
Toronto prices close mixed in quiet end-of-the-week trading. The TSE-300
composite index edged up 0.44 points, or 0.01 per cent, to close at
4,281.02, but declining issues outnumbered advances 395 to 311. Volume was
47.42m shares, down from yesterday's 54.23m and trading value fell to
CDollars 553.2m from CDollars 568.1m. Among gold issues, American Barrick
dropped  1/2 to 32  5/8 and Placer Dome lost  1/4 to 31.
The mining group posted the day's biggest increase, up 1.2 per cent.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo vaulted 6.7 per cent in moderate trade after domestic
and foreign players returned to the market on renewed optimism ahead of the
implementation of a new currency, the real, on July 1.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares ended up 1,695 at 26,960
points. Turnover was CR399.7bn (Dollars 205.8m).
