  [Excerpt] Ankara--Amendment of the Montreux Convention, 
which regulates passage through the Turkish straits, is out of 
the question, officials from Turkey's Foreign Ministry said on 
Wednesday [16 March]. Officials say it is impossible to alter 
provisions of the Montreux Convention, which was signed on 20 
July, 1936 by Turkey, Russia, Britain, France, Bulgaria, Greece, 
Japan and Italy and concerns freedom of passage through the 
straits. However, they point out that a process for amending 
the convention should be set in motion to prevent this freedom 
of transit from leading to environmental damage. They note that 
work launched two years ago is still continuing and that the 
recent collision between the two Greek Cypriot vessels at the 
Black Sea entrance to the strait on Sunday night and similar 
incidents in the past have encouraged more work on the subject. 
Drawing attention to moves which give the impression that 
Turkey is in a way suspending the right of freedom of passage 
through the straits or is obstructing the exercise of that 
right, officials stress that no such situation exists. They 
note that subjecting vessels to certain rules and regulations 
and removing freedom of passage are two different issues. They 
add that including Russia, many countries and oil companies have 
been informed about the new safety rules for the straits which 
will be put into effect on July 1. They note that contrary to 
press reports, Turkey has not received any final objection or 
veto from Russia. [passage omitted]
