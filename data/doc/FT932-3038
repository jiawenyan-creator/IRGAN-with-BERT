FT  16 JUN 93 / Observer: Fighting fit
As the smoke starts to disperse over the Tottenham Hotspur Football Club
battle ground, the casualty list does not appear to be quite as long as
expected.
General Portfolio, the Harlow-based insurance company, for example, reports
that it has not been damaged by events. It will continue to flog insurance
policies to Spurs supporters for another 14 months at least, even though the
deal was set up by ousted chief executive Terry Venables.
Venables did the deal with GP because he liked the look of its national
sales director, Bob Patmore, a former star of the Tottenham youth team. But
GP spokeswoman Valerie McKirdy stresses that it had not been a personal deal
but a three-year agreement signed with one of the Tottenham Hotspur
companies. 'We are certainly not aware of anything to suggest that the
agreement is not continuing,' she says.
To be fair, GP is quite practised in dealing with the sensibilities of new
owners. A wholly-owned subsidiary of a French company, it continues to use a
logo of the Duke of Wellington.
