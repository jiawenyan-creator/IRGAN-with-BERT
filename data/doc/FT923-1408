FT  23 SEP 92 / Patten hint on airport finance
Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, hinted yesterday he was losing
patience over finance for the colony's airport project, Simon Holberton
reports. Hong Kong's main Chinese and English language newspapers have
carried reports that China would reject Mr Patten's revised financing plans
for settling the six-month dispute.
Mr Patten said that it was not possible to work indefinitely on new plans
for China to consider. One which maximised Hong Kong's ability to raise debt
had been rejected and now an alternative means of funding the HKDollars
167.3bn (Pounds 12.7bn) project was in doubt.
The reports, believed to emanate from a senior official of the Xinhua News
Agency in the colony, said China objected to using funds from land sales for
the project.
