  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 1 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic has denied reports by foreign agencies that 
Bosnian Serbs shelled Sarajevo on Friday. In connection with 
agency reports that four civilians were killed and several 
others wounded in Sarajevo, Karadzic told TANJUG that this was a 
new attempt by the Moslems ruthlessly to manipulate the 
international public. 
  "Anyone in the world who has followed this bloody civil war 
at all could have guessed that the Moslem side would stage some 
New Year's gift to the international audience," said Karadzic. 
  "This is by now largely a crime against one's own people, 
which the Moslem leadership has been perpetrating constantly, 
and the international public should finally expose it by 
publishing the naked truth that Moslems do not care even for 
their own citizens since their slogan is -- the end justifies 
the means," said Karadzic. 
  In the meantime, the Bosnian Serb parliament late on Friday 
temporarily ended a regular session. It was ruled that a report 
on the peace talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina, which were held in 
Geneva and Brussels in December, and a debate on this major 
subject of the current session be put off for the next session, 
which has been scheduled for January 10.
