THE WORLD 
Rescue aircraft, taking advantage of a break in a severe Arctic snowstorm, 
managed to land at the North Pole where eight explorers had been briefly 
stranded. The team, led by Robert Swan of Britain, reached the roof of the 
world after a 600-mile, 56-day journey. The rescue planes flew the explorers to 
their base at Eureka on Ellesmere Island on their way home. Because of poor 
weather conditions, the three Twin Otter aircraft had been unable to pick up 
the group as scheduled, and all of the team members suffered frostbite on their 
feet and faces. Members of the expedition, launched to draw attention to global 
pollution, planted a U.N. flag at the North Pole on Sunday, organizers of the 
Icewalk organization said.
