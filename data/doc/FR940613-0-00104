 

STATE: NEW MEXICO 


COMBINATION: Truck tractor and 2 trailing units_LCV 
LENGTH OF THE CARGO-CARRYING UNITS: Not applicable 
MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE GROSS WEIGHT: 86,400 pounds 


OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS: The cargo-carrying length restriction does not apply to this combination. The length of
each trailing unit is limited to 28.5 feet. This describes a two trailing unit vehicle whose operation is guaranteed
by the STAA of 1982 regardless of inter-unit spacing. As long as each trailing unit is 28.5 feet long or less, cargo-carrying
length is not restricted. This combination is listed as a LCV because it can exceed the 80,000-pound threshold established
in the Congressional definition. The 86,400-pound gross weight limit is grandfathered for New Mexico. 


WEIGHT: 

Single axle = 21,600 pounds. Tandem axle = 34,200 pounds. Load per inch of tire width = 600 pounds. The total gross weight
with load imposed on the highway by any vehicle or combination of vehicles where the distance between the first and
last axles is less than 19 feet shall not exceed that given for the respective distances in the following table:
