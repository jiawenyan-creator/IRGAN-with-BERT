FT  13 JAN 93 / Observer: Trendy
What does one make of Burton's latest management gimmick? Only a week after
the retailer announced that it was cutting 2,000 full-time jobs and creating
3,000 part-time ones, Burton has issued 250 of its retail store managers
with About Time, a new book on part-time working by Patricia Hewitt, deputy
big cheese of the Institute for Public Policy Research, Lord Hollick's
socialist think-tank.
Burton stresses that the Pounds 9.95 tomes are not intended as farewell
presents but are meant to educate. No doubt Hewitt will be chastened by the
fact that the biggest interest in her book so far has come from a pillar of
the capitalist establishment seeking an alibi for getting rid of people.
