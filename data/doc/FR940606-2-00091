<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and Order Granting
Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 4 to a Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Size of Orders Eligible for Entry
in the Auto-Ex System</DOCTITLE>


May 27, 1994.


On October 15, 1993, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b4 thereunder,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 a proposed rule change to permit the PSE's Options Floor Trading Committee (``OFTC'') to increase, in one or more classes
of multiply-traded equity options, the size of orders eligible for entry into the PSE's Automatic Execution System
(``Auto-Ex'') to the extent necessary to match the size of orders eligible for entry into any other exchange's automated
execution system.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Notice of the proposed rule change appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on December 22, 1993.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. The PSE subsequently filed Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed
rule change on December 21, 1993, Amendment No. 3 on March 28, 1994, and Amendment No. 4 on May 25, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 This order approves the proposal, as amended.

Under Auto-Ex, eligible small public customer market or marketable limit orders are routed through the system and
automatically executed at the prevailing market quote. Currently, Auto-Ex applies to orders of 10 contracts or less.

Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3, contained various changes to the proposed rule change as originally filed; however, these
changes were withdrawn and superseded by Amendment No. 4 to the proposed rule change. See Letter from Michael Pierson,
Senior Attorney, PSE, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Derivatives and Equity Oversight, Division of Market Regulation,
Commission, dated May 25, 1994 (``Amendment No. 4''). In Amendment No. 4, the PSE also proposes to adopt Rule 6.87(c)
which would provide that firms entering orders for execution on Auto-Ex may not divide them up in order to make their
parts eligible for entry into Auto-Ex.
</FOOTNOTE>


The PSE proposal adds Commentary .01 to PSE Rule 6.87(a) relating to the operation of Auto-Ex in equity options. Interpretation
.01 would permit the OFTC to increase, in one or more classes of multiply-traded equity options, the size of orders
eligible for entry into Auto-Ex to the extent that other options exchanges permit such larger-size orders in multiply-traded
equity options of the same class or classes to be entered into their own automated execution systems.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal further provides that any such increase in the order eligibility size will be conditioned on PSE's filing
the specific terms of the increase for immediate effectiveness under section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act. The proposal
requires that the PSE include in any such filing, representations that Auto-Ex has the capacity to accommodate the
increase in the order eligibility size. Such representations shall cover systems capacity as well as the market-making
capacity of market-makers participating in Auto-Ex.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Any proposed increase that is initiated by the PSE and not made in response to matching an increase effectuated by another
market would have to be filed with the Commission for review under section 19(b) of the Act.

Any proposed increase that is initiated by the PSE and not made in response to matching an increase effectuated by another
market would have to be filed pursuant to sections 19(b)(1) or 19(b)(2) of the Act.

The PSE represents that it has more than adequate market-making capacity to handle any reasonably expected increase
in orders. Telephone conversation between Michael Pierson, Senior Attorney, Market Regulation, PSE, and Brad Ritter,
Attorney, Office of Derivatives Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, on March 15, 1994.
</FOOTNOTE>


Finally, the proposal would add Rule 6.87(c) which would prohibit the splitting of orders for purposes of making the
parts eligible for entry into Auto-Ex. The Exchange believes this is necessary in order to comply with the purpose
behind the Auto-Ex system which is to allow for the execution of small customer orders. Additionally, when large orders
are split and then routed through Auto-Ex, market makers do not have the opportunity to adjust their markets to reflect
the order flow. Finally, the PSE believes that this provision is consistent with the rule adopted by the Chicago Board
Options Exchange (``CBOE'') regarding orders routed through its Retail Automatic Execution System (``RAES'').

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
6 and 11A.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission notes that the proposed rule change is substantively identical to a proposal recently
approved by the Commission relating to RAES at the CBOE.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes that the rationale supporting approval of the CBOE proposal applies equally to the PSE's
proposed rule change. In particular, the Commission continues to believe that the development and implementation
of the Auto-Ex system provides for more efficient handling and reporting of orders in PSE equity options through the
use of new data processing and communications techniques, thereby improving order processing and turnaround time.
