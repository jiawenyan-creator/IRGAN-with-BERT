BILL TO BAN NEWS VENDING OF PORN BURIED 
Worried about possible infringement on First Amendment guarantees of free 
speech, a state Senate committee on Tuesday moved to bury a bill that would ban 
the sale of sexually explicit tabloids from sidewalk news racks. 
The intent of the measure, sponsored by Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport 
Beach), was to keep pornography out of the hands of minors. 
Backed by the county of Los Angeles and the state PTA, Ferguson's bill called 
for curtailing the sale of the sex newspapers from coin-operated racks. 
Ferguson's measure gained surprising support from some civil libertarians in 
the Assembly, which passed it in January, and seemed to be gaining 
behind-the-scenes momentum on the Senate side before Tuesday's hearing. 
But the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 5 to 4 to stop the Ferguson bill in 
its tracks and instead hold onto it for interim study -- a move that many 
acknowledged was the death knell for the controversial measure this year. 
In voting to hold the bill over for study, Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) cited 
possible legal problems with the bill's restrictions against the vending 
machine sales of any publication showing seven specific sexual acts. Such 
restrictions could be held to violate the First Amendment, he said. 
"I'm sympathetic to families trying to inculcate values that they believe in 
their children," Lockyer said. "I'm not sure that state intervention in 
people's lives is the way to accomplish that." 
Ferguson, however, said his measure was aimed only at relocating the sale of 
the explicit tabloids, not regulating their contents. 
"It might be more obvious to them if there's a loophole in the law that allowed 
liquor, whiskey, to be sold from a vending machine from which they (minors) had 
access," Ferguson said. "They would quickly see that that's a loophole, and 
they would do away with it."
