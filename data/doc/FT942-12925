FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Freeport back in the black
Freeport-McMoRan, one of the world's biggest producers of copper, gold,
sulphur and phosphate fertiliser, moved back into the black in the first
quarter. Net income, after gains and charges, was Dollars 12.37m, or 9 cents
a share, against a loss of Dollars 55.35m or 39 cents last time.
The group was helped by higher sales volumes, a copper price protection
programme, higher gold prices, lower cash production costs and improved
phosphate fertiliser volumes and prices. Revenues rose to Dollars 449.6m
from Dollars 300.8m.
Freeport sold 155.7m lb of copper and 201,300 troy ounces of gold in the
quarter, compared with 138.1m lbs and 140,300 ounces. It expects to produce
720m lbs of copper and 800,000 ounces of gold in 1994 as a whole.
Nearly all copper production is covered by a programme that ensures a
minimum of 90 cents a lb, compared with yesterday's London Metal Exchange
three-month price of 87 cents. Lower ore grades pushed up copper cash
production costs from 50.2 cents a lb to 59.4 cents.
Fertiliser sales rose from 495,000 short tons to 534,000 tons, while sulphur
sales climbed from 465,000 long tons to 516,000 tons. Oil and gas sales were
up from 433,000 barrels to 823,000 barrels.
