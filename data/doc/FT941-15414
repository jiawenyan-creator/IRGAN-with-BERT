FT  15 JAN 94 / Warning of more coal mine closures
British Coal yesterday warned that more closures among the remaining 22
operating pits were inevitable.
But Mr Andrew Horsler, commercial director, said that the programme of
restructuring was nearing its end.
Meanwhile a management buy-out team at the Betws pit in south Wales said it
hoped to resume mining this spring after British Coal indicated that it was
the preferred candidate to operate the mine.
