SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The primary purpose of consultation is to provide information and to discuss options available to the Department
of the Interior under the NPR, the Federal Workplace Restructuring Act, and other reorganization or downsizing directives.
A packet of information for the January meetings will be distributed to Federally recognized Indian Tribes by the
Bureau area office local contact person. The packets will also be available at each meeting. Some of the parameters
imposed by the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of the Interior have been set forth in a tribal leader

Written comments should be mailed in sufficient time to be received on or before January 31, 1995, to the Bureau of Indian

Following the consultation, the Bureau will finalize its streamlining implementation plan which incorporates
the consultation comments, the mandates of the Office of Management and Budget, as well as the Department of the Interior
and the Congress. To the extent feasible and under the constraints of existing federal mandates to downsize and streamline,
the BIA will make a good faith effort to integrate and incorporate tribal concerns and recommendations into the final
implementation plan which must be submitted to the Department of the Interior by February 28, 1995. 

Travel to the consultation sessions will be paid by the tribal participants.
