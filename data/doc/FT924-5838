FT  25 NOV 92 / EC industry ministers defer decision on Spanish government
European Community industry ministers yesterday deferred until next year a
politically sensitive decision on Spanish government plans for restructuring
the Spanish steel industry, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. The ministers
urged Madrid to continue bilateral discussions with individual member states
about the controversial proposals, which would maintain steelmaking in the
volatile Basque country.
Several hundred steelworkers from northern Spain demonstrated outside the
council headquarters in Brussels (picture above) as Mr Claudio Aranzadi,
Spanish industry minister, attempted to convince his colleagues that the
plan was acceptable. But, according to diplomats, only Italy gave tentative
backing. British officials said there had been a consensus among other
states that the promised capacity cuts were too low. Greater cuts might
threaten the core proposal to build a new steel-mill at Bilbao.
Any decision on the plan would have to be unanimous and ministers were not
expected to take such a drastic step yesterday. But Commission officials
believe that if the issue is not resolved soon, Madrid may try to go ahead
with the restructuring without EC approval.
Ministers were also unable to take a formal position on Commission proposals
to grant financial and commercial support to the whole EC steel industry
under the European coal and steel treaty.
