FT  25 AUG 94 / Kremlin rebuffs Sevastopol
Russian officials yesterday rebuffed the attempt of Sevastopol, the Crimean
port city, to declare itself a part of Russia earlier this week. A political
gift to Kiev on the day Ukrainians are celebrating their third anniversary
as an independent state, Russia's move is another indication of the thaw in
relations between the two Slav neighbours. 'Russian politicians do not plan
to take advantage of Ukraine's internal problems and warm their hands over
the hardships of others,' Mr Mark Urnov, an adviser to Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, said yesterday. The city council of Sevastopol, home port to
the contested Black Sea Fleet and part of a region which elected an openly
separatist president in January, has proclaimed the city Russian territory.
Kiev said the move had no legal force but chose not to take any punitive
actions.
