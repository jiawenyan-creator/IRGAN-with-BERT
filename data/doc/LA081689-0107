ARUM DROPS NUNN AFTER FIGHTER'S LACKLUSTER VICTORY OVER BARKLEY 
Michael Nunn, who failed to sell out the 11,000-seat arena Monday night in Reno 
and was lackluster in his defense of the International Boxing Federation 
middleweight championship against Iran Barkley, was dropped Tuesday by promoter 
Bob Arum, one fight short of the expiration of their contract. 
Arum said Monday that he had not wanted the fight in the Lawlor Events Center 
at the University of Nevada Reno, where it drew an embarrassingly small crowd 
of 5,900. Even worse, there were more boos than cheers when Nunn was given a 
majority decision, and most outspoken of all was Arum, who derisively called 
Nunn "an ESPN fighter" afterward. 
Said Dan Goossen, Nunn's manager: "(Nunn) wasn't sharp . . . but I was a little 
disappointed over Arum's comments. . . . "Bob and I came to an understanding a 
few weeks ago that we'd go our separate ways after this fight. We had one more 
Arum fight left under our contract, but we've both agreed to end our 
relationship." 
Arum was in San Francisco Tuesday, promoting his Dec. 7 Leonard-Duran fight, 
and could not be reached for comment. EARL GUSTKEY
