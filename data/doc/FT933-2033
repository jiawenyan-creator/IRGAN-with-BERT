FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Geevor revival plan gets boost after rights
oversubscribed
THE PLAN to revive Geevor, the tin mining company, as a coal mining concern
received a boost yesterday when a Pounds 1.75m rights issue was 50 per cent
oversubscribed. The new company is being led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, the
former commercial director of British Coal, to run pits no longer wanted by
the state-owned company.
The placing and rights issue, underwritten by Guinness Mahon, paves the way
for a reconstruction of Geevor and a settlement with its creditors who will
convert debt into shares.
The new group will include UK Consolidated Mining, which owns a lease on
Cwmgwili, an anthracite mine in South Wales. The company is being acquired
through an issue of Pounds 2m of shares. Mr Edwards will also reverse his
own company, Coal Investments, into Geevor, and take over as group executive
chairman. Coal Investments has the tender rights for five British Coal
mines.
Geevor, whose shares have been suspended for 18 months, will now regain its
listing and be renamed Coal Investments plc. Details are to be approved at
an EGM around October 20.
The proceeds of the rights issue will be used mainly to redevelop Cwmgwili.
If Coal Investments succeeds in its bid for British Coal pits it will
probably return to the shareholders for more money, Mr Edwards said
yesterday. British Coal is expected to announce the results of the tender in
the coming weeks.
Mr Edwards said he was confident that it would be possible to create a
successful coal business in the UK despite the recent upheavals.
