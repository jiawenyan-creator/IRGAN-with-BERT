  [Excerpts] Brother 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, deputy 
chairman of the Presidential Council, yesterday made inspection 
visits to several residential areas in the capital, Aden, which 
had been subjected to the random barbarous bombardment by the 
forces of the Sanaa regime. [passage omitted] 
  The brother deputy chairman of the Presidential Council also 
inspected one of the mosques damaged by the destructive and 
barbarous bombardment. Addressing citizens who had gathered in 
the area, he expressed astonishment at the fatwa issued by the 
Sanaa regime's ulema in contradiction with our pure Islamic 
faith in that it divides the Yemenis into the house of Islam and 
the house of polytheism [dar al-islam wa dar al-shirk]. [passage 
omitted] 
  Brother 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, the deputy chairman of 
the Presidential Council, went on in his address to the 
citizens, to deal with the foreign political stance. He said 
the political leadership had responded positively to the 
initiative of Mr. Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the UN envoy, regarding the 
cease-fire and a delegation from the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen had accordingly left for Cairo for discussions on this 
matter as a positive response to the initiative.
