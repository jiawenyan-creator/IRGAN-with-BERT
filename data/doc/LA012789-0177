IN BRIEF; 
JAPAN HOLDS '88 INFLATION TO 0.7% 
Japan announced today that inflation for the year came to 0.7%, a figure 
greeted with relief by economists who had worried that brisk economic growth 
and a new sales tax might push up prices. 
They said the figure, the third straight year of inflation of less than 1%, 
points to low inflationary pressures for 1989 as well, with lower costs of 
imports dampening domestic prices and keeping a lid on inflation. 
Prices fell 0.3% in December from the previous month and rose 1% from a year 
earlier, the government's Management and Coordination Agency said. 
The month-on-month decline in December was caused mainly by a sharp fall in 
prices of fresh vegetables and seaweeds, the government said. 
Many economists expect Japan's consumer price increases to hold below 2% this 
year, a level that presents no threat to the economy. 
"If consumer prices were climbing 3% or 4%, we would have problems. But with 
prices going up between only 1% to 2% this year, there is no need for worry," 
said chief economist Toshiaki Kakimoto at Sumitomo Bank. 
Kakimoto sees consumer prices gaining 1.6% in 1989. Forecasts by other 
economists range between 1.4% and 1.9%.
