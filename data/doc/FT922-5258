FT  01 JUN 92 / Investment boost seen in the west Midlands
FOREIGN companies in the west Midlands are planning to increase their
investment this year, according to a survey published today by accountants
KPMG Peat Marwick and the West Midlands Development Agency. The survey of
344 companies employing 68,000 people uncovered capital expenditure plans
this year totalling Pounds 147m. About two thirds of the investment will
come from companies owned in the US, Germany and Japan.
Although half the respondent companies this year expect an increase in
turnover, broadly reflecting the sentiment of domestic companies, the
recession led more than two in five foreign companies to report results
worse than they had originally expected.
Foreign companies have thus been caught up in the difficulties of the
engineering industry, highlighted over the past two years in the domestic
sector by a progressive rundown in the number of people employed.
