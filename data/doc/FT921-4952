FT  06 MAR 92 / Appointments: Tyree quits Salomon for Lehman
American Daniel Tyree, who has left Salomon Brothers after 17 years, is to
become vice chairman of Lehman Brothers International, where he will be
running the day-to-day aspects of the investment bank's London-headquartered
business.
Tyree, 43, who insists he left Salomon because he was 'ready for a change
after 17 years', says he looked carefully for a firm where he wanted to
spend the rest of his working career.
Among the wave of resig-nations hitting the Wall Street firm, Tyree's is one
of Salomon's more high profile losses. As head of the high yield bond
business in New York for the past two years, he has successfully brought the
firm up the league tables following the demise of Drexel.
Between 1987 and 1989, Tyree was based in London as head of Salomon's
worldwide investment banking operations outside the US.
Lehman says the appointment is designed to supplement its management team in
Europe. Tyree explained yesterday that he would be working closely with
Steven Spiegel, current chairman and ceo of Lehman Brothers International,
who will concentrate on developing the firm's overall European business.
