SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



On December 14, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 65336) the final results of administrative review of the antidumping duty order on silicon metal from Argentina
(57 FR 48779, September 26, 1991). The review covered the period March 29, 1991 through August 31, 1992.

Since Silarsa did not respond to the Department's request for cost of production and constructed value information,
for the final results we relied on best information available (BIA) for Silarsa. As BIA, we used the dumping margin
petitioners had constructed by using the information on the record of the review.

Subsequent to the publication of the final results, we received timely allegations of ministerial errors from Silarsa.
Silarsa requested that we correct certain claimed errors in the calculation of Silarsa's cost of manufacturing (COM)
and constructed value (CV), which affected the final margin we assigned to Silarsa. Silarsa pointed out that, contrary
to basic accounting principles, the Department had erroneously double-counted the cost of materials by adding ``1992
WIP (work in process)'' and ``1992 Finished Goods'' to Silarsa's ``1992 Purchases''.

In response, petitioners stated that Silarsa's request was without foundation. Petitioners noted that the Department
assigned Silarsa a BIA rate of 54.97% because Silarsa terminated its participation in the review only after the Department
initiated a sales-below-cost investigation based on petitioners' allegations. Petitioners further asserted
that the arguments raised by Silarsa in its clerical error allegation did not constitute the type of ministerial error
discussed in 19 CFR 353.28(d), which covers ministerial errors of a clerical or arithmetic nature.

Petitioners contended that Silarsa argued its case in its rebuttal brief and in its December 23, 1993, clerical error
allegation. In petitioners' view, this attempt by Silarsa to bring its post-decision reargument of its case under
the guise of allowing for identification of ministerial errors is an abuse of that rule and should be rejected.

On March 2, 1994, the Court of International Trade (CIT), in 

Silarsa S.A. 

v. 

United States 

(Court No. 940100030), issued an order remanding the final results of the 19911992 administrative
review of the antidumping duty order on silicon metal from Argentina for the correction of ministerial errors. We
agreed with Silarsa and the CIT that certain inventory items were double-counted in petitioners' calculation of
Silarsa's cost of materials. On March 17, 1994, the Department submitted its redetermination on remand to the CIT.
On March 24, 1994, the CIT affirmed the Department's redetermination on remand.



Amendment to the Final Results of Review



As a result of our correction of this ministerial error, we have determined that the weighted-average margin for Silarsa
for the period March 29, 1991 through August 31, 1992 is 24.62 percent.

Accordingly, the Department will determine, and the Customs Service will assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate
entries. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service.

Furthermore, a cash deposit of 24.62 percent will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise produced
by Silarsa and entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the publication date of this notice.
The cash deposit requirement for manufacturers/exporters other than Silarsa specified in the final results of this
administrative review remain unaffected by this amendment.

This notice is published pursuant to section 751(f) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and 353.28 of the Department's
regulations.
