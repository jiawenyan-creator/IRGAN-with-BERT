NEWPORT BEACH; 
DAMAGES SET AT $150,000 AS FIRE SWEEPS 6,300-SQUARE-FOOT HOME 
An early-morning fire partially destroyed a house under construction in an 
exclusive Newport Beach area Thursday, causing estimated damages of $150,000, 
authorities said. 
Firefighters were called to the scene at Ocean Beach Drive in the Spyglass Hill 
area about 2:20 a.m. after officers in a Newport Beach police helicopter 
spotted flames from the two-story structure, police spokesman Bob Oakley said. 
About 25 firefighters brought the blaze under control but not before one-third 
of the building was gutted. Investigators believe that the fire was started 
accidentally by a plumber's torch, Battalion Chief Ray Brown said. 
Brown said the owner of the 6,300-square-foot home estimated its value at $1 
million. 
The blaze was about half a mile from a home on Port Ramsgate that was damaged 
in a fire Wednesday. 
That residence, located across a greenbelt from a street plagued with fires the 
last 10 months, sustained $25,000 worth of damages. The cause of the fire is 
still under investigation, Brown said.
