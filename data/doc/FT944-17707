FT  06 OCT 94 / Lufthansa joins Rushdie curbs
Lufthansa, the German airline, has refused to carry British author Salman
Rushdie because it considered him a security risk, the Tageszeitung
newspaper reported yesterday. British Airways has a standing ban on carrying
Rushdie as a passenger for security reasons. Alleged blasphemy in his book,
The Satanic Verses, led to the Iranian death threat. The Tageszeitung said
the airline refused to carry Rushdie when the author visited Germany in
August last year and in October 1993. Reuter, Bonn
