FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Life Style Care to join market
Life Style Care, the nursing home group which specialises in caring for
elderly mentally infirm patients, is seeking funds for expansion through a
June flotation expected to value the group at between Pounds 20m and Pounds
25m.
The company is coming to market next month through a placing which is
expected to raise about Pounds 10m. Proceeds will be used to pay down
estimated net debt of Pounds 6m.
Life Style was formed in 1987 by Mr Ramesh Sachdev, the accountant and
property dealer who is now chief executive, and his wife, Pratibha.
Mr Sachdev's family is expected to sell only a small part of its 85 per cent
holding to raise some Pounds 2m. The two remaining shareholders - Eagle Star
and Gresham Trust - are also expected to retain the bulk of their holdings.
The company operates in the north and north-west of England and the
Midlands, but is thought to be keen to take advantage of lower property
prices in London.
It has 14 homes, all of which are freehold, with 564 beds. Occupancy rates
over the past two years have been 96 per cent.
In the year to June 30, Life Style reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m
on sales of Pounds 5.3m. Pre-tax profits for 1994, which will be forecast in
the flotation prospectus, are expected to show a significant increase, the
company said.
