NEWSWIRE: JOHNSON WILL GO TO USC 
El Toro High School's Rob Johnson, among the top high school quarterbacks in 
the Southland, has made an oral commitment to attend USC and is expected to 
sign a national letter of intent with the Trojans Feb. 6. 
Johnson, a 6-foot-5, 210-pound senior, was the top-rated quarterback in Orange 
County last fall, passing for 2,207 yards and 25 touchdowns while completing 
71% of his passes in 10 regular-season games. 
An all-county wide receiver as a junior, Johnson became the first player in 32 
years to make the team at different positions. He was Orange County athlete of 
the year for 1989-90 after earning all-league honors in football, baseball and 
basketball. 
A right-handed pitcher, Johnson said he would play both football and baseball 
at USC. 
"I was recruited by some great schools, but the situation at USC was best for 
me," Johnson said. "I like the (football) coaching staff, the quarterback 
situation; their offense is similar to El Toro's, and the baseball facilities 
are great." 
Johnson's older brother, Bret, and current USC quarterback Todd Marinovich 
played for rival schools at El Toro and Capistrano Valley in 1986-87. Bret 
played two seasons at UCLA before transferring to Michigan State, where he will 
be eligible next season. TOM HAMILTON
