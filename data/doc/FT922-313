FT  29 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Hobson cuts losses and calls for Pounds 2m
via rights
HOBSON, the USM-quoted toiletries and homecare equipment manufacturer, is
raising up to Pounds 2m through a rights issue. It also announced a reduced
pre-tax loss of Pounds 210,000 and that it was in the early stages of making
an acquisition.
More than 40m shares are being offered on 1-for-1 basis at 5p. The shares
closed at 7 3/4 p on Friday down 1 1/4 p on the day.
The issue is being underwritten by Hawknote with the limitation that it does
not exceed a 55 per cent stake in the enlarged capital.
Mr Richard Thompson, Hobson's chairman is a director of Hawknote.
The loss, for the year to March 31, compared with a deficit of Pounds
270,000 on turnover of Pounds 6.35m (Pounds 2.68m).
The company said that the toiletry manufacturing side continued to suffer
from the recession and sales were short of expectations.
No improvement was expected until the economy improves.
Trading in physical commodities increased significantly after September 1991
and has continued to make a positive contribution.
Losses per share came out at 0.52p (0.74p).
If Hawknote increases its holding as a result of the underwriting to more
than 30 per cent, Mr Richard Thompson will resign as director of Hawknote
and Thompson International, Hawknote's parent, and Hobson will cease to
conduct its commodity trading through Muirpace, a Thompson offshoot.
And the Takeover Panel has waived the obligation for Hawknote to make a bid.
Hawknote undertakes to cut its holding below 30 per cent within 12 months.
If Hawknote holds more than 48 per cent then it will be able to buy more
shares without incurring further obligations to make a general offer to
shareholders.
