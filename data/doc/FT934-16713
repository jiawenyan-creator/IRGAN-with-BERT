FT  05 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: BNP's bargain price
It was always a safe bet that the first French privatisation stocks would be
priced cheaply to guarantee success. But the FFr240 a share price tag
attached to BNP dropped off the bottom of most investors' ready reckoners.
With so much at stake, the government clearly felt it could take no chances.
The generous retail allocation suggests it was especially keen to entice
private investors who were badly burned after the earlier wave of French
privatisation. Still, BNP's new shareholders will have to be patient. The
bank, which last reported a 61 per cent fall in interim net profits, may not
return to growth until 1995.
Some distinctly Gallic twists to privatisation appeared yesterday which are
likely to characterise the whole programme. The incestuous clutch of French
industrial groups to appear on BNP's share register will doubtless help
ensure the stability the government so craves. French companies with huge
debts may see additional attractions to buying stakes in one of their main
creditors.
One intriguing aspect, though, is the emergence of foreign investors as core
shareholders, with the Kuwait Investment Authority, Roche, and GE of the US
most striking among them. BAT Industries, too, was among the favoured few.
Its financial services arm no doubt relished the chance to buy a worthwhile
chunk of one of Europe's biggest banks. But its tobacco business was
probably just as keen.
With the state-owned tobacco monopoly Seita soon to be privatised, what
better opportunity could BAT have had to win friends and influence in
France's financial corridors?
