FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Bollore plans asset disposals
after slipping into the red
BOLLORE Technologie, the heavily-indebted French industrial group, will
remain in the red this year but says it is hoping to improve its financial
position by making asset disposals.
Mr Vincent Bollore, chairman, told a shareholders' meeting in Paris that the
group had been hit by the poor performance of SDV, its lossmaking shipping
division.
He warned that SDV was unlikely to return to profit before the start of 1994
because of the 'catastrophic situation in the international shipping
business'.
SDV made a loss of FFr500m (Dollars 87.5m) last year, dragging the group
into the red. Bollore made a net loss of FFr358m in 1992 against net profits
of FFr81m in 1991. The group hopes to sell the entire SDV fleet, which is
worth FFr2.5bn, to its banks.
Mr Bollore said that SDV's situation would continue to be 'bad' in 1993. The
group's other interests - in paper, transport, petrol and tobacco - had all
remained profitable in the first few months of this year.
However, Bollore, which made provisions of FFr900m last year, expects to
have to make further write-downs in 1993.
The group hopes to raise around FFr350m this year by selling other
non-strategic assets, having made FFr1bn from disposals in 1992.
Mr Bollore envisaged making sales in the paper division as well as in
shipping.
The proceeds of the disposals will be used to reduce Bollore's debt, which
stood at FFr7.5bn at the end of 1992, compared with shareholders' funds of
FFr3.8bn. by
