FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Dresdner, BNP postpone plans for
share exchange
DRESDNER Bank and Banque Nationale de Paris of France, which last year
finalised terms for a co-operation agreement, have postponed their plans for
a share exchange until after BNP's forthcoming privatisation, write David
Waller in Frankfurt and Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
Both Mr Wolfgang Roller, chief executive of Dresdner, and Mr Rene Thomas,
chairman of BNP, stressed that the co-operation agreement remained intact
and also reaffirmed their commitment to implementing the share swap, which
is intended to involve the two banks taking up to 10 per cent of each
others' equity. However, BNP said the exchange had been delayed until after
privatisation, as its valuation would be different as a private sector
company.
The proposed share swap is still subject to the approval of shareholders of
both banks and must also be approved by the European Commission competition
authorities.
