IN BRIEF; 
DOLLAR ENDS MIXED IN EUROPE 
The dollar ended mixed in European trading today after a round of central bank 
intervention dampened the currency's strength. Gold prices were mixed. 
Foreign exchange dealers said the absence of any strong policy statements 
arising from the Group of Seven industrialized nations meeting in Washington on 
Friday provided the foundation for a further strengthening of the dollar. 
But the bullishness was dampened by intervention from the Federal Reserve, West 
German Bundesbank and other European central banks, which sold dollars and 
diluted the impact of the currency's rise. 
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
rose 0.43 yen to close at 129.70. Later in London it was quoted at 129.60 yen. 
In London, one British pound cost $1.7345, cheaper for buyers than the $1.7410 
exchange rate late Friday. 
Gold bullion was trading in London at a bid price of $388.95 a troy ounce, up 
from $388.25 bid late Friday. 
In Zurich, the bid price was $387.50, down from $389.90 bid late Friday. 
Financial markets were closed in Hong Kong on today for the Chinese Lunar New 
Year holiday. They reopen Thursday.
