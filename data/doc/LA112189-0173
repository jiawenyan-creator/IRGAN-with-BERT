THE SIDELINES; 
MEMPHIS STATE COACH FIRES SIX 
Memphis State football Coach Chuck Stobart, ending his first season with the 
Tigers with a 2-9 record, has fired six assistant coaches. 
Stobart inherited the assistants when he replaced former Memphis State Coach 
Charlie Bailey in June. Bailey resigned a month earlier during an investigation 
by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. that put the Tigers on three years 
probation. The NCAA said Bailey advised a player to lie about an improper 
summer job supplied by a school booster. 
Stobart dismissed the assistants Monday but did not say when he planned to 
replace them. 
Released by Stobart were offensive coordinator Darrell Dickey, defensive 
coordinator Pete Kuharchek, running backs coach Palmer Hossler, defensive line 
coach Tom Turchetta, defensive ends coach Jim Taubert and secondary coach Fred 
Manuel.
