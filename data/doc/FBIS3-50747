  [Text] Army Minister Zenildo Zoroastro has ruled out any 
possibility of a coup in Brazil. There is no risk of 
Fujimorization in Brazil, the minister said, noting that 
President Itamar Franco has already said everything that had to 
be said on the subject. 
  The military ministers had thought about releasing a note 
denying the statements by Justice Minister Mauricio Correa. The 
ministers, however, preferred not to promote greater controversy 
on the subject.
