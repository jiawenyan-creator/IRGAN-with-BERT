  [Text] Concerning the latest arrests of the leaders of the 
Party of Democratic Action [SDA] in Sandzak by the Serbian and 
Montenegrin police, we express our strongest condemnation and 
protest, reads a statement by the SDA of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Using the pretense of armed rebellion and endangering the 
territorial integrity of the self-styled Yugoslavia, the 
authorities of this unrecognized country have been terrorizing 
and persecuting Muslims in an unprecedented way, particularly 
prominent people and members of the SDA. This fascist state has 
been conducting ethnic cleansing for a long time now in an 
attempt to force the members of other nations to emigrate, and 
thus create a pure national state for the Serbian people alone. 
  We appeal to the relevant international institutions to send 
their representatives to Serbia and Montenegro, and to undertake 
every possible action to halt this criminal persecution, and 
ensure the observance of civil freedom and rights -- in 
accordance with standards of international law -- for all the 
nations on the territory of the so-called Yugoslavia. 
  This was said in a statement by the SDA of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
