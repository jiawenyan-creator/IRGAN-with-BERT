 

The applicant maintains that this proposed fee arrangement complies with PTCE 774. However, there is one difference
from PTCE 774 requested by the Bank for which an exemption is required. In this regard, one of the requirements
of PTCE 774 has been that any change in any of the rates of fees would require prior written approval by the Second
Fiduciary of the Plans participating in the Funds. The applicant maintains that where many Plans participate in a
Fund, the addition of a service or any good faith increase in fees could not be implemented until written approval of
such change is obtained from every Second Fiduciary. The applicant proposes an alternative which the Bank maintains
provides the basic safeguards for the Plans and is more efficient, cost effective, and administratively feasible
than those contained in PTCE 774. 




It is represented that in the event of an increase in the rate of any investment management fees, investment advisory
fees, or similar fees, the addition of a Secondary Service for which a fee is charged, or an increase in the fees for Secondary
Services paid by the Funds to the Bank over an existing rate that had been authorized by the Second Fiduciary, the Bank
will provide, at least thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation of such additional service or fee increase,
to the Second Fiduciary of all the Plans invested in such Fund a written notice of such additional service or fee increase,
(which may take the form of a proxy statement, letter, or similar communication that is separate from the prospectus
of the Fund and which explains the nature and amount of the additional service or the nature and amount of the increase
in fees). In this regard, such increase in fees for Secondary Services can result either from an increase in the rate
of such fee or from the decrease in the number or kind of services performed by the Bank for such fee over that which had
been authorized by the Second Fiduciary of a Plan. It is represented that providing notice in this way will give the
Second Fiduciary of each of the Plans adequate opportunity to decide whether or not to continue the authorization
of a Plan's investment in any of the portfolios of the Funds in light of the increase in investment management fees,
investment advisory fees, or similar fees, the additional Secondary Service for which a fee is charged, or the increase
in fees for any Secondary Services. In addition, the Bank represents that such fee increase will be disclosed to the
Secondary Fiduciaries in a supplement to the Fund's prospectus in the case of an increase in fees for investment management,
investment advisory, or similar services and in the Fund's Statement of Additional Information in the case of an additional
Secondary Service for which a fee is charged or an increase in the fees for Secondary Services. 
10. It is represented that the written notice of an additional service for which a fee is charged or a fee increase, as
described in paragraph 9 above, will be accompanied by a Termination Form, as defined in paragraph (i) of section III,
and by instructions on the use of such form, as described in paragraph (m) of section II, which expressly provide an
election to the Second Fiduciaries to terminate at will any prior authorizations without penalty to the Plans. In
addition, it is represented that the Second Fiduciary will be supplied with a Termination Form annually during the
first quarter of each calendar year, beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year that begins after the date
the grant of this proposed exemption is published in the 

Federal Register

 and continuing for each calendar year thereafter, regardless of whether there have been any changes in the fees payable
to the Bank or changes in other matters in connection with services rendered to the Funds. However, if the Termination
Form has been provided to the Second Fiduciary in the event of an increase in the rate of any investment management fees,
investment advisory fees, or similar fees, an addition of a Secondary Service for which a fee is charged, or an increase
in any fees for Secondary Services paid by the Fund to the Bank, then such Termination Form need not be provided again
to the Second Fiduciary until at least six months have elapsed, unless such Termination Form is required to be sent
sooner as a result of another increase in any investment management fees, investment advisory fees, or similar fees,
the addition of a Secondary Service for which a fee is charged, or an increase in any fees for Secondary Services. 
The Termination Form will contain instructions regarding its use which will state expressly that the authorization
is terminable at will by a Second Fiduciary, without penalty to any Plan, and that failure to return the form will be
deemed to be an approval of the additional Secondary Service or the increase in the rate of any fees and will result in
the continuation of all authorizations previously given by such Second Fiduciary. It is represented that termination
by any Plan of authorization to invest in the Funds will be effected by the Bank selling the shares of the Fund held by
the affected Plan within one business day following receipt by the Bank, either by mail, hand delivery, facsimile,
or other available means at the option of the Second Fiduciary, of the Termination Form or any other written notice
of termination. If, due to circumstances beyond the control of the Bank, the sale cannot be executed within one business
day, the Bank shall have one additional business day to complete such sale. 
11. It is represented that the rates paid by each of the portfolios of the Funds to the Bank for services rendered may
differ depending on the fee schedule for each portfolio and on the daily net assets in each portfolio. The investment
advisory fees paid to the Bank by the Funds will be based on the different fee rates of each of the portfolios into which
the assets of the Plans are allocated. For example, for services provided to the Money Market Portfolios, the California
Tax Free Fund, and the Tax Free Fund, the Bank receives the following fees from HighMark based on each portfolio's average
daily net assets: (a) .40% of the first $500 million; (b) .35% of the next $500 million; and (c) .30% of the remaining
average daily net assets. For services provided to the Non-Money Market Portfolios, the Bank receives the following
fees from HighMark based on each portfolio's average daily net assets: (a) 1.00% of the first $40 million; and (b) .60%
on the remaining average daily net assets. It is represented that the Bank currently allocates investments by the
Plans among the portfolios offered by HighMark, and proposes to continue to allocate the assets of the Plans among
the portfolios of HighMark and/or any of the Funds under the terms of this proposed exemption.
