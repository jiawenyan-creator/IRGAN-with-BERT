CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SACRAMENTO; 
NON-SEXIST NAME EATS UP MANPOWER 
Sacramento public works officials say they were just having some fun when they 
started a contest to find a non-sexist term for manholes. But since the word 
got out, people from Florida to Canada have been lighting up the City Hall 
switchboard. 
Some of them want to know about "the women who are taking over the City 
Council," said council receptionist Sibyl Winterberger, adding that most 
callers just made "lewd and offensive suggestions." Mayor Anne Rudin called it 
"a tempest in a manhole." Meanwhile, contest organizers said some "half-decent" 
suggestions for manhole replacements have come in. "We've got 'road hole,' 
'street hole,' 'confined space' and 'person entry and exit port,' " said senior 
engineer Randy Witt. "Some of them, though, just don't roll off the tongue the 
way 'manhole' does."
