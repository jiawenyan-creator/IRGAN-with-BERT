COOK IT LIGHT: TOMATOES: THE MEAT OF A SIMPLE PASTA SAUCE 
I look forward each year to the time when fresh basil is readily available 
because it is a necessary ingredient in my own favorite pasta sauce. This sauce 
is made with raw tomatoes, and in Italy it is called by a variety of names. 
On menus it is sometimes called Pasta Pomodoro Cruda, which means simply pasta 
with raw tomato sauce. This dish is also called Pasta Margherita and Pasta a la 
Checca. In Tuscany, the sauce is spread on toast as an appetizer or hors 
d'oeuvre. 
The secret to success in this recipe is to allow the tomatoes to drain for at 
least two hours. This concentrates their flavor and makes a much tastier sauce. 
A trick I learned in Italy is to freeze vine-ripened tomatoes when they are at 
their peak so you will have truly flavorful tomatoes all year. Then, to peel 
them, just put them in warm water and they literally pop out of their skins. 
FRESH TOMATO AND BASIL SAUCE 
2 pounds ripe tomatoes 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
2 cloves garlic, minced

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
1/4 teaspoon crushed dried red pepper, or to taste 
Cooked pasta 
Plunge tomatoes in boiling water 10 seconds to remove peel easily. Drain 
tomatoes, then peel and dice. There should be about 4 cups. Sprinkle with salt 
and mix well. Place salted tomatoes in colander and allow to drain 2 hours. 
Combine garlic, basil leaves, parsley, olive oil and black and red peppers. Add 
drained tomatoes and mix well. Serve over pasta. Makes 3 cups sauce or 6 
(1/2-cup) servings.
