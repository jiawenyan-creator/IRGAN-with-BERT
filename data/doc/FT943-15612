FT  08 JUL 94 / Litigation activity forecast to change
Lawyers are forecasting changes in litigation business over the next five
years. They expect litigation in the property, construction, banking and
fraud sectors to grow most quickly, while cases in insolvency and personal
injury are expected to increase less quickly, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
The forecasts come from a national survey of litigation specialists by KPMG
Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm. KPMG has built a forensic accountancy
section of 70 expert witnesses and investigators on the back of what it says
is a litigation boom.
Nearly 80 per cent of 105 lawyers in the survey predicted overall growth in
litigation of 25 per cent by 1999. This compares with the 80 per cent growth
that KPMG says the market experienced in the last five years.
The survey says one reason the market is growing is the greater awareness of
litigation opportunities, partly because of marketing by lawyers. It adds
that the increasing complexity of commerce is also a factor.
