SOLUTIONS TO A CHRISTMAS DILEMMA 
The answer to "What can non-Christian children do?" is enjoy the festival and 
join in the fun. 
We enjoyed all cultural festivals held in the streets of New York. The same 
enjoyment should apply in the schools. The Oktoberfest, Chinese New Year, Mardi 
Gras, Italian, Greek, Irish, etc., all festivals should be respected, preserved 
and enjoyed in America. People spend thousands of dollars and time their 
vacations to coincide with foreign festivals. We are lucky, we have them in our 
own back yard.
