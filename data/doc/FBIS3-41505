  [Text] Britain will be allowed to delay or relax EC 
pollution standards for drinking water, bathing beaches and 
rivers. 
  Mr. Major confirmed in the Commons last night that the 
European summit in Brussels had agreed to repeal the 10-year-old 
bathing and drinking water directives and replace them with less 
intrusive regulations, enabling ``broad, general standards'' to 
be applied at national level. 
  Seventeen EC directives have been withdrawn or amended in 
the 
purge of legislation, part of an Anglo-French initiative to 
apply the principle of ``subsidiarity'' to laws which gave 
Governments little flexibility. 
  Two key EC directives on water quality remain in force: one 
aimed at reducing pollution from nitrates and another on urban 
waste water treatment, which Mr. Clarke, Chancellor, said 
recently would cost Britain &pound;10 billion to implement 
instead 
of the original estimate of &pound;2 billion. 
  According to Mr. Yeo, Environment Minister, water 
bills--forecast to rise by up to &pound;100 by the end of the 
century in some areas--would now rise more slowly. 
  Mr. Major said other Governments were listing EC laws to 
axe. 
``We are determined to maintain high standards, but we are 
determined, too, to simplify European legislation, to make it 
less intrusive and leave more room for national choice.'' 
  However, officials stressed that the extent to which Britain 
would be allowed to relax standards for drinking water was not 
clear, as new directives had to be agreed in the spring. 
  ``We cannot repeal EC laws simply because we think the 
standards are set too high,'' said one. ``The aim is to simplify 
decision-making and meet the Maastricht Treaty requirements that 
as much legislation as possible is conducted at national level 
unless it can be shown that it would be more effective at EC 
level.'' 
  The cull of EC directives has been led by Mr. Major and Mr. 
Clarke, against the advice of Mr. Gummer, Environment Secretary, 
who has said it would be politically unpopular to be seen 
dismantling EC pollution controls. 
  Ministers argued yesterday that there would not be a fall in 
Britain's standards. 
  Mr. Yeo said the Government would be using the new 
flexibility to determine its own standards for drinking water, 
incorporating the latest advice from the World Health 
Organisation on relaxing the standard for some pesticides. 
Britain provides water in excess of the present EC pesticides 
standards to 14.5 million people. The WHO recommends, however, a 
five-fold tightening of standards for lead, one of the most 
toxic substances. 
  Mr. Yeo said: ``I see it as part of my job to protect 
consumers against the extraordinary demands of some of the Green 
lobbies, who have the Brussels bureaucrats totally in their 
power and who are pressing ahead with demands for improvements 
which have no scientific or medical basis at all.'' 
  ``We do not want to waste money on things that have no 
benefit to the consumer.'' 
  Mr. Chris Smith, Labour environment spokesman, called the 
legislative changes a disaster. ``This is a smokescreen for 
saying the Government wants lower standards because they want 
lower costs. What this represents is a major step away from the 
fight against pollution.'' 
  Mr. Andrew Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, 
said: ``The idea that the British Government can be trusted on 
its own to ensure compliance with the highest standards to 
protect the quality of our rivers or drinking water is a joke.''
