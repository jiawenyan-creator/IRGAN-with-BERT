VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA; 
SCHOOL DISTRICT PLANS CUTBACKS 
Faced with a potential $1.2-million budget shortfall, Ventura Unified School 
District administrators announced proposed cutbacks Tuesday for the 25-school 
district, including layoffs, a hiring freeze and reductions in district 
programs. 
Unveiled at Tuesday night's school board meeting, the proposed layoffs would 
affect 15 district employees, including five administrators and two assistant 
principals at the district's two high schools. 
The proposed cutbacks, which also include trimming such programs as the visual 
program, would pare the entire $1.2-million shortfall from the district budget. 
The district is facing the potential deficit because of a proposal by Gov. 
George Deukmejian to trim the state budget allocation for education. Deukmejian 
has proposed cutting the annual 4.95% cost-of-living increase for California's 
elementary and secondary schools to 3%. 
The district's estimated $1.2-million deficit is based on a 4.2% cost-of-living 
increase, a figure educators hope will be the compromise reached when the state 
budget is finalized. If the 3% increase should be instituted, district 
officials estimate, an additional $500,000 in cuts will be necessary. 
Richard Averett, an assistant superintendent, said the proposed cutbacks, while 
harsh, are not unusual. School districts statewide are scrambling to bring 
their budgets in line with decreased revenues, Averett said. 
The Ventura Unified Board of Education will decide whether to implement the 
cutbacks at its May 8 meeting. KEN McALPINE
