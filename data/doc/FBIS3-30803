  [Text] The defense positions of the free Brcko territory 
came under attack again last night. The Serb aggressor fired 
heavily with Brovings, antiaircraft guns and M-84 machine guns 
at the entire defense line of the free Brcko territory. The 
heaviest fire was directed last night at the central part of the 
Brcko front, where the enemy pounded our positions with 60-mm 
and 82-mm mortars from armored combat vehicles. 
  The grouping of the aggressor's forces is continuing, but 
the 
enemy has serious problems with his manpower. At 1820 last 
night a new clash took place and small arms fire was exchanged 
among chetniks in Spomenik near Brod, the chetniks being those 
who had previously burned down Muslim houses at Brod.
