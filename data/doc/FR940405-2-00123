105. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 91.70(a) and 91.82(b).



Project/Activity: 

City of Woonsocket, Rhode Island and City of New Bedford, Massachusetts. Waiver of the submission deadlines of the
FY 1993 Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) and the FY 1992 CHAS Annual Performance Report. City
of East Providence, Rhode Island. Waiver of the FY 1992 CHAS Annual Performance Report deadline.



Nature of Requirement: 

Subpart G. Section 91.70(a) of the CHAS final rule provides that a housing strategy must be submitted annually between
October 1 and December 31, with December 31 being the deadline for submission. Subpart H, Section 91.82(b) of the CHAS

Granted By: 

Don I. Patch, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Grant Programs, CG.



Date Granted: 

March 4, 1993.



Reasons Waived: 

Waivers were granted for good cause. Each city requested an extension to the date of submission for their CHAS Annual
Plan and/or Performance Report. Otherwise, they would lose FY 1993 funding for all programs that require an approved
housing strategy as a condition for funding. Undue hardship would result if HUD applied authorized sanctions and
suspended funding of existing programs in these communities. Such action would deprive low and moderate income persons
of the benefits of HUD-funded programs. Woonsocket was granted an 8 day extention for the CHAS and the Performance
Report since the Mayor was unavailable to sign the documents by the deadline. New Bedford was granted an 8 day extension
for the CHAS and a 67 day extension for the Performance Report. East Providence was granted a 64 day extension for the
Performance Report submission. Both cities report the need for the waivers was due to their oversights or incomplete
understanding of the HUD requirements.




106. 

Regulation: 

24 CFR 92.150(a).



Project/Activity: 

City of West Palm Beach, Florida. Waiver of the deadline for submission of a HOME Program Description for FY 1993.



Nature of Requirement: 

Subpart D, 92.150(a) of the HOME Interim Rule requires that each participating jurisdiction submit its Program
Description for a fiscal year to HUD within 45 days of HUD's publication of the HOME formula allocations. For fiscal
year 1993, the due date for Program Descriptions was March 15, 1993.



Granted By: 

Don I. Patch, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Grant Program.



Date Granted: 

March 15, 1993.



Reasons Waived: 

The City was unable to get the application and program description approved by the City Commission prior to the deadline.
The City was advised that, in future years, it should anticipate the deadline and be sure the HOME Program Description
approval is included on the Commission's agenda in a timely manner.
