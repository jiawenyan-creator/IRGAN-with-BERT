FT  23 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weakness abroad outweighs a
little Irish comfort
AFTER firming on Friday following the Irish 'yes' vote on the Maastricht
treaty, markets weakened yesterday after Tokyo's steep overnight decline,
writes Our Markets Staff.
The Irish referendum result had given traders a brief moment of comfort
following the Danish 'no' earlier in the month which seemed to have
effectively derailed hopes for closer economic union.
There was general agreement among analysts yesterday that whatever muted
euphoria had been generated by the Irish referendum result had been
dissipated by the start of trading.
Mr Sushil Wadhwani of Goldman Sachs said he did not expect European bourses
to move decisively higher until the French referendum on Maastricht had been
held. He also pointed out that there was uncertainty over Germany's attitude
towards Maastricht, with the possibility that the German government might
seek to make amendments.
PARIS erased most of Friday's gains as a domestic newspaper poll showed that
only 29 per cent of investors were bullish about the stock market. Weakness
in the Matif, as arbitrageurs covered their positions following the
government's FFr140m bond swap plan announced on Friday, also weighed on
share prices.
The CAC 40 index dropped 28.15 or 1.5 per cent to 1,885.77 in turnover of
FFr2.4bn, of which around FFr421m was generated by a block trade in BSN and
FFr297.5m in Lyonnaise des Eaux.
Dealers said that the block trades were likely to have been executed by an
insurance company in order to realise a profit in one fund, and transfer the
stock to another fund. Lyonnaise fell FFr6 to FFr522 and BSN lost FFr12 to
FFr1,080.
Michelin dropped FFr7.50 to FFr191.50 on rumours, denied by the company,
that it was about to have a FFr12bn rights issue.
FRANKFURT saw the DAX index close just 2.25 lower at 1,770.64 after a 1.36
decline to 704.12 in the FAZ at midsession, and share prices moved little in
the post-bourse. Turnover fell from DM13.9m, inflated by the expiry of
derivatives contracts, to just DM4.4bn.
Volkswagen's drive for volume in the European mass car market, reflected in
a 17.5 per cent market share in the first five months of 1992, was marked by
a small rise in the shares which closed just DM1.60 higher at DM403.70.
Mr Reinhard Fischer, head of European research at Paribas Capital Markets,
observed that VW shares had already produced a 20 per cent gain relative to
the DAX index since the start of 1992. He added that VW's marketing costs
were shooting up, and that Paribas saw earnings on a declining trend over
the next two years.
MILAN rose on dealers' hopes that a government would be formed this week.
However, a further rise in interest rates, reflecting higher bond yields and
the lira's weakness, acted as a brake on the market. The Comit index rose
4.69 to 474.57 in turnover estimated at between L80bn-L90bn after L79.5bn.
Fiat rose L137 or 2.6 per cent to L5,452 as professionals and institutions
bought the stock in anticipation of a stock market rally when the new
government is announced. On the screen market, the state telephone company
Sip remained the most heavily dealt stock, gaining L4 to L1,304 in volume of
3.4m shares.
ZURICH heard that hopes of an economic recovery in the first quarter of 1992
had not been fulfilled, and the SMI index lost 22.4, or 1.2 per cent to
1,846.9.
Roche recovered some early losses after the group said that its Hivid AIDS
drug had received FDA approval for use in combination with Wellcome's
Retrovir. The certificates, which headed the active list, ended SFr40 easier
at SFr3,330 after SFr3,310.
AMSTERDAM declined in sluggish trade, the CBS Tendency index losing 0.20 to
125.20 in turnover of some Fl 400m.
Volmac fell Fl 3.40 or 12.6 per cent to Fl 23.50 with just 18,000 shares
traded: the software group reported disappointing profit figures after the
close on Friday. KLM's weakness continued, down Fl 1.10 to Fl 37.20, on
nervousness that the transatlantic price war may affect earnings.
Profit-taking in Heineken saw the shares off Fl 2.00 at Fl 166.20.
MADRID fell in line with other markets, the general index losing 3.08 to
246.41. Trading in Ercros, the chemicals group, was suspended at Pta177
after the chairman announced his resignation. Its shares have lost 33 per
cent over the last month.
STOCKHOLM eased but a large block trade in the pharmaceutical company,
Astra, accounted for more than half of turnover which climbed from SKr430m
to SKr837m. Astra shares became free of foreign ownership restrictions
yesterday; the A ended SKr1 lower at SKr543 on in SKr547m as the
Affarsvarlden General index fell 4.2 to 924.7.
In COPENHAGEN, the central bank's weekend promise to meet Unibank's
liquidity requirements, following rumours about the bank's financial
soundness, stabilised the share price which closed up DKr2 at DKr158. The
All-Share Index slipped by 1.69 to 316.93, writes Hilary Barnes.
Danisco fell by DKr25 to DKr733 following a report that the company is being
investigated by the EC in connection with allegations of a price cartel in
the European sugar market. Danisco's annual results for 1991-92 are due
today.
TEL AVIV hit a new record, anticipating decisive results from today's
Israeli general elections and contradicting opinion polls which have
projected a deadlock. The blue chip share index rose 2.48 to 137.22 in
turnover of 92.2m shekels.
