FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Leif Hoegh earnings rise to
NKr117m
LEIF HOEGH, one of Norway's biggest shipowners, yesterday reported it had
increased first-quarter net profit to NKr117m (Dollars 17.6m) from NKr97m
last year and forecast that profit, after financial items, for the year as a
whole would show an improvement.
Group net revenue was lifted by NKr9m to NKr414m, as operating profit rose
by NKr11m to NKr101m. The company's share price rose by NKr3 to NKr94 on the
Oslo bourse yest-erday.
Hoegh said it expected operating profit for 1993 to emerge at around
NKr350m, up from the NKr309m of 1992. The shipowner said it was satisfied
with the first-quarter performance and that its financial position was
strong.
Norgeskreditt, the private sector mortgage company, said first-quarter
pre-tax profit rose more than threefold to NKr81.7m from NKr26.9m, helped by
higher gains on securities and an increase in net interest income.
Norgeskreditt said plans to become a commercial bank, announced earlier this
year, had been approved by shareholders. It expects banking operations to
commence by the end of this year.
Group first-quarter net interest income rose to NKr73.1m from NKr45.9m, as
gains on bonds and securities increased to NKr34.5m from NKr0.5m. Loan
losses rose to NKr11m from NKr9.3m.
Jyske Bank, Denmark's fourth largest bank, has reported an increase in
first-quarter profits before bad loan provisions to DKr363m from DKr158m a
year ago.
Earnings from interest and fee income increased by 8 per cent to DKr474mn.
