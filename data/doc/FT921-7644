FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Setback for Dublin glass manufacturer
Ardagh, the Dublin-based glass manufacturer, incurred its first setback in
many years with a fall from IPounds 2.35m to IPounds 2.1m (Pounds 1.95m) in
taxable profits for the 26 weeks to December 24.
The result was struck on turnover little changed at IPounds 17.3m compared
with IPounds 17.4m last time.
Mr R Ian Morrison, chairman, said that economic recovery worldwide was
proving more elusive than originally predicted and was tending to have an
adverse impact on the performance of the glass industry throughout Europe.
The interim dividend has been maintained at 0.725p from earnings of 5.36p
(5.63p).
