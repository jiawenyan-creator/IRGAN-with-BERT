<F P=106> [By Huang Tien (7806 3944): "Beijing To Release Wang Juntao </F>
on Bail for Medical Treatment"] 
  [Text] An informed source has revealed that the mainland 
Chinese authorities are considering releasing Wang Juntao in 
response to U.S. concerns about human rights on mainland China. 
In the meantime, the Beijing authorities have contacted the 
United States to investigate the possibility of sending Wang 
Juntao to the United States for medical treatment, but the 
request has been rejected by the U.S. side. 
  Information has it that Tian Qiyu, vice minister of public 
security in Mainland China, while exchanging views on human 
rights issues with visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary Shattuck 
early this month, proposed releasing Wang Juntao on bail and 
sending him to the United States for treatment of his liver 
disease. Shattuck's counterproposal was that it is more 
suitable for Wang Juntao to stay at home for treatment. 
  It is said that the reason the United States turned down the 
request to send Wang Juntao to the United States was because the 
U.S. side is worried that Beijing intended to expel 
pro-democracy activists from the country into "exile" abroad in 
an attempt to alleviate pressure from public opinion and reduce 
the outcry from opposition groups within Mainland China.
