  [Text] Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- The second-day session 
of the International Chuche Idea Seminar on Independence, Peace 
and Friendship was held in New Delhi on April 9. 
  A course of lectures was given at the session. 
  Hwang Chang-yop, secretary of the C.C. [Central Committee], 
the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the Korean Social 
Scientists Association, and Shuhachi Inoue, director general of 
the International Institute of the Chuche Idea, gave lectures on 
the respective subjects "Present Era and Ideal of Mankind" and 
"Inevitabilities of the Downfall of Capitalism and Victory of 
Socialism". 
  Pointing out that socialism is a true society of people 
whose 
master is the popular masses, Shuhachi Inoue stressed it is 
clearly verified by Korea's socialism, the embodiment of the 
chuche idea. 
  He explained why Korea's socialism is growing stronger and 
ever-victorious even under the present complicated situation in 
which socialism has suffered setbacks and capitalism revived in 
some countries. 
  He stressed the need to remain loyal to the great leader 
President Kim Il-song, founder of the immortal chuche idea, and 
dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, guide of the socialist cause, for the 
victory of the human cause of socialism and the cause of 
independence and to effect a new turn in propagandising and 
disseminating the chuche idea. 
  The seminar continues.
