FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Charge eliminates T-D Bank's
earnings
TORONTO-DOMINION Bank's first-quarter earnings were virtually wiped out by
the costs of absorbing an ailing Canadian trust company, higher loan
writedowns and losses on securities investments.
The bank reported earnings of CDollars 1m (USDollars 700m), equal to a loss
of 2 cents a share, in the three months to January 31, compared with income
of CDollars 106m, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier.
The latest figure includes an after-tax charge of CDollars 79m related to
restructuring required by the purchase of the 154-branch Central Guaranty
Trust.
TD also posted a CDollars 22m loss on its securities investments.
Loan loss provisions rose to CDollars 150m from CDollars 120m, due largely
to the continued difficulties of some Canadian corporate customers.
Non-performing loans stood at CDollars 1.7bn at end-January, up from
CDollars 1.6bn a year earlier, including a 69 per cent jump in troubled
loans to large domestic customers.
Assets stood at CDollars 81bn on January 31, up from CDollars 69.5bn a year
earlier. The bank noted that its capital-to-assets ratio of 9.4 per cent
remains well above regulatory guidelines.
National Bank of Canada reported first-quarter net profits of CDollars 45m,
or 28 cents a share, down from CDollars 50m, or 32 cents, a year earlier,
writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Return on average assets of the country's sixth-largest chartered bank was
0.46 per cent against 0.53 per cent. However, performance improved from the
previous quarter. Interest margins contracted because of bigger volumes of
non-performing loans, volatile interest rates and higher levels of cash
resources. But assets grew, especially in retail business.
The brokerage unit had lower profits. Loan loss provision for the latest
quarter was CDollars 75m and for the full fiscal year is estimated at
CDollars 300m.
Total assets at January 31 were CDollars 41.6bn, up CDollars 1.6bn from
end-October 1992.
