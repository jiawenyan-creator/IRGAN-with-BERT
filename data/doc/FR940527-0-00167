 

Two commenters agreed with OSM's proposed deletion of 779.22(b) in its entirety. They felt that much of the
information required under this provision will already be contained in the application through other applicable
provisions. 
 
a. Former 779.22(b)(1) required a description of the type of mining method used at any previously mined area.
To the extent that the applicant is able to submit the required cross sections, maps, and plans of prior mining operations
within and adjacent to the permit area under existing 30 CFR 779.25(a) (5) and (8), the regulatory authority can determine
from this information the type of mining methods which were used. OSM agrees with the one comment received regarding
the deletion of 779.22(b)(1) that the information provided by this section has historically been of minimal benefit.

 
b. Former 779.22(b) (2) and (3) required a description of the coal seams or other mineral strata mined
and the extent of coal or other minerals removed from the previously mined area. This information can easily be calculated
by the regulatory authority from other information required to be submitted by the applicant under 30 CFR 779.25(a)
(3), (4), (8), and 30 CFR 780.11(a). OSM agrees with the one comment received regarding the deletion of 779.22(b) (2)
and (3) that the information provided by these sections has historically been of minimal benefit. 
 
c. Former 779.22(b)(4) required a statement of the approximate dates of previous mining activities. In its
1979 rules, OSM did not require the precise dates of these activities because of the acknowledged difficulty of obtaining
such information with any degree of accuracy (44 FR 15041, March 13, 1979). In practice, information as to the approximate
dates of previous mining activities has proven to be generally unnecessary. The only time that the approximate dates
of previous mining activities might be necessary is when the applicant intends to reclaim in accordance with the requirements
of 30 CFR 816.106. Under those circumstances, the applicant is required by the authority, that of 30 CFR 773.15(c)
and (c)(12), to affirmatively include in the permit application information as to the cessation dates of previous
activities. The regulatory authority must then find in writing that the site of the proposed operation is a ``previously
mined area'' as defined in 30 CFR 701.5. Accordingly, the continuance of 779.22(b) serves no useful regulatory
purpose. 
 
One commenter opposed this deletion claiming that the information of 779.22(b)(4) is necessary when judging the
success at 30 CFR 816.116(5). As this section is nonexistent, the apparent intended reference is 30 CFR 816.116(b)(5).
OSM rejects this comment as there is no clear relationship between the approximate date of premining operations required
under 779.22(b)(4) and establishment of the baseline level of vegetative cover before redisturbance required by
816.115(b)(5). As it is, there is more than sufficient information required under the other permit application provisions
of 30 CFR parts 779 and 780 for the regulatory authority to fulfill its responsibilities under 816.116(b)(5).

 
d. Former 779.22(b)(5) required a statement of the premining land use for lands previously affected by mining
to the extent such information is available. Final 780.23(a)(1) will include this requirement among its provisions.
One commenter supported the proposed deletion of 779.22(b)(5) on the basis that the scope of information required
by that section served little useful purpose. Another commenter contended that because the same historical land
use information required by 779.22(b)(5) would also be required by proposed 780.23(a)(1), the stated purpose of
the rulemaking of eliminating or reducing paperwork would not really be accomplished. In partial response to this
comment and as discussed above, OSM decided not to finalize the expanded reporting requirement of proposed 780.23(a)(1)
but instead retain that section's existing, less burdensome requirements. This necessitated the inclusion of former
779.22(b)(5) in final 780.23(a)(1) in order to ensure that 515(b)(2) and 508(a)(2)(A)
of the Act are implemented and that the land use of previously mined land is described. This description helps to ensure
the restoration of the land affected by mining will be to the same or higher or better land use than existed prior to any
mining as required by the Act. The permit applicant's historical land use reporting burden continues to be reduced
as the consolidation of requirements into final 780.23(a)(1) eliminates duplicative reporting requirements.

 
2. This rulemaking deletes 30 CFR 779.22(c) which required a description of the existing land uses and land use classifications
under local law of the proposed permit area and adjacent areas. While OSM considers the information required by this
provision to be important land use information, it is essentially the same information required by former 780.23
(a)(4) and (b) redesignated in the final rule as 780.23 (b)(3) and (c). These redesignated sections
provide that the application indicate the consideration given to making the surface mining activities consistent
with applicable State and local land use plans and programs as well as comments on the proposed use by applicable State
and local agencies.
