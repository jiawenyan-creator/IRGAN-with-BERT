FT  27 JAN 93 / Unit trust funds at record Pounds 63.88bn
FUNDS UNDER management in the unit trust industry reached a record high of
Pounds 63.88bn at the end of last year,even though investors made net
repurchases in December, Philip Coggan writes.
Strong stock markets pushed up the figure, which compares with Pounds
55.15bn at the end of 1991.
The Unit Trust Association said December's net repurchase figure of Pounds
24m came after a change in the tax position of life companies. Some life
companies previously found it convenient to hold investments in their unit
trust subsidiaries. Tax changes have forced them to switch holdings into
directly-managed funds.
Private investors are still buying unit trusts. Net sales to them were
Pounds 93m in December - the most popular sectors were UK equity income and
money markets - as society rates fell.
