  [Text] During a telephone conversation with Colombian 
Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, Cuban President Fidel Castro 
denied reports from Bogota about a recent meeting held in Havana 
with Colombian guerrillas. Fidel Castro stated that neither 
Alfonso Cano, Ivan Marquez, nor Bishop Nel Beltran were present 
at the solidarity meeting held in Havana on 27 and 28 January as 
the Bogota newspaper EL TIEMPO falsely reported.
