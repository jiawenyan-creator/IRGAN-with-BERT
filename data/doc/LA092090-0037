SCHOOL FUNDS 
This state is most populous in the nation. If California were an independent 
nation, it would rank in the top 20 financially. 
Yet we have politicians who year after year hold our children as pawns in their 
schemes to get back at one another. The recent statements and actions of our 
leaders in Sacramento are those of spoiled brats, schoolyard bullies, and they 
would not be tolerated in classrooms. 
Gov. Deukmejian proudly stated that during his Administration education 
spending has risen 65%. This use of figures to cloud the issue again reflects 
his true commitment to education. How does the governor answer these simple 
yes/no questions: Does the state spend 65% more per student now than it did 
eight years ago? Has the state allocated funds to allow schools to keep pace 
with the rising costs of textbooks, supplies, fuel, etc.? There are many other 
simple questions which could be asked, but the answer to all is no.
