FT  09 OCT 92 / Denktash occupation plan draws UN fire
THE NEW UN co-ordinator on Cyprus yesterday criticised a Turkish-Cypriot
plan to move people into an area abandoned by Greek Cypriots, Reuter reports
from Nicosia.
Mr John Maresca said the measure did not contribute 'a positive attitude'.
He was answering a question on a plan, disclosed by Mr Rauf Denktash, the
Turkish-Cypriot leader, on Tuesday, to house foreign students in buildings
in Varosha, a deserted suburb of the Turkish-held coastal town of Famagusta.
The Greek-Cypriot inhabitants of Varosha fled their homes when the Turkish
army invaded the island in 1974. Turkey has 30,000 troops in the occupied
northern third of the island.
The government of Cyprus protested to the United Nations about the Varosha
plan yesterday. However, Mr Maresca, speaking after meeting President George
Vassiliou of Cyprus, said he thought progress was possible in the next round
of UN-sponsored talks in New York on October 26.
