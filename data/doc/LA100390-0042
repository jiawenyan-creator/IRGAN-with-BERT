Chopin in Warsaw: Young pianists from 30 countries have gathered in Warsaw for 
the 12th Frederic Chopin Piano Competition. The winner -- the best of 220 
contestants -- will be announced Oct. 21 and will join a list of laureates such 
as Martha Argerich of Argentina and Garrick Ohlsson of the United States. For 
the first time, contestants are being asked to pay their hotel bills to help 
the Solidarity-led government meet its share of the $1 million bill. BETH KLEID
