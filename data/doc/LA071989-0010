HERRICK ESTABLISHED CLEVELAND TRADITION 
While visiting friends in the San Fernando Valley recently, I followed the 
hiring of Marc Paez as the new basketball coach at Cleveland High with great 
interest. As an alumnus and a member of the 1981 City Section 3-A champion 
Cavalier basketball team, I find it interesting that your staff writers give 
Bob Braswell credit for "establishing one of the most highly regarded programs 
in the state." 
Bob did a fine job at Cleveland and should be given credit for his efforts. It 
was, however, Coach Greg Herrick who built and developed the Cleveland 
basketball program to its present status as a prep power. Coach Herrick was the 
guiding force behind the success of Bob Braswell, and Bob maintained the fine 
tradition that Coach Herrick left behind. 
Coach Herrick taught me many things in the two years that I played for him and 
he has likewise positively influenced many other young men in his years at 
Cleveland -- including Bob Braswell. Give "Braz" his due, but when you talk 
about the establishment of the Cleveland dynasty, all credit should be laid at 
the feet of my coach -- Greg Herrick.
