U.S. FAILS TO RESOLVE ISSUE OF AIDING JAPAN JET PROJECT 
High-level talks among U.S. government agencies have so far failed to resolve 
trade questions over proposed U.S.-Japanese cooperation on Japan's new FSX 
fighter, Administration officials said today. 
The Bush Administration is examining a decision made last year by the outgoing 
Reagan Administration, which came after years of wrangling, to let General 
Dynamics Corp. help Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries build a new jet based 
on the General Dynamics' F-16. 
But opponents of the proposed $8-billion deal, including members of Congress, 
have cautioned that the cooperation would give Japanese aerospace industry a 
major boost in its competition with U.S. defense firms. 
Officials said a meeting held Friday on the FSX included representatives from 
the White House, National Security Council, U.S. Trade Representative's office 
and the State, Defense, Commerce, Labor, Energy and Treasury departments. 
Published reports have said questions about the deal are being raised by the 
Commerce Department and the trade representative's office. The Bush 
Administration has not yet sent notification to Congress that it intends to go 
through with the technology transfer deal.
