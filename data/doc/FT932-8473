FT  19 MAY 93 / Accountants back merger of institutes
THE UK's six principal accountancy bodies face the prospect of merger if
they follow the views of their members canvassed in a poll conducted earlier
this year.
The findings of the survey, due to be released today, show an overwhelming
majority in favour of 'rationalisation' of the profession.
That could lead to greatly increased co-operation and ultimately to the
merger of the existing professional bodies, each with their own
qualifications and different letters after the names of their members.
Nearly three quarters of a sample of 7,000 of the UK's 200,000 accountants
said rationalisation was necessary, with 43 per cent strongly favouring
reform. Just 19 per cent opposed a change.
The bodies affected are the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, the Institute
of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, the Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants, the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants and the
Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.
Publication of the survey results, conducted by the market research agency
Tenet Consulting, has been delayed following debate between the bodies over
the way to present the results.
Executives and elected officials have been highly sensitive to the subject
of mergers because several previous attempts to reduce the number of bodies
have failed in the last few years. The poll shows that members of the
Scottish Institute - who resisted a merger with the English Institute in
1989 - were the only ones with more opposition than support for
rationalisation.
Cipfa members, who rejected a merger with the ICAEW in 1990, have shifted to
favouring rationalisation. The bodies are to announce a working party to
consider the options, chaired by Mr David Bishop of KPMG Peat Marwick, past
president of the certified accountants, which will report back in July.
