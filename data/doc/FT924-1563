FT  17 DEC 92 / IBM share price falls on payout warning
SHARES in International Business Machines plunged for the second successive
day yesterday as Wall Street analysts sharply lowered their earnings
forecasts in the light of Tuesday's announcement of deepening problems at
the world's largest computer manufacturer.
Many analysts said this week's restructuring announcement, which will
include 25,000 job losses and capacity cutbacks in 1993, might still be
inadequate to turn IBM around - even though it came on top of 40,000 job
cuts in 1992 and numerous other packages that were supposed to revitalise
the company.
Some analysts advised clients to sell the stock, which only a few years ago
was regarded as the bellwether of the US market.
The shares dropped Dollars 4 1/4 to close at Dollars 51 7/8 with IBM being
by far the most actively traded stock. The shares plunged 11 per cent on
Tuesday and stood nearly 50 per cent below the 1992 high of Dollars 100 3/8
.
IBM is to take a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.9bn) fourth-quarter charge to cover
its restructuring - bringing to Dollars 11.4bn its workforce and capacity
cut charges in 1992 - and it says its fourth-quarter operating results will
be about break-even, well below Wall Street forecasts.
Analysts said the company seemed to be on course for 1992 operating earnings
per share of around Dollars 2.50, and a loss after charges of around Dollars
4.75bn, which would be the largest by a US company, topping General Motors'
Dollars 4.45bn loss in 1991.
With IBM warning that poor business conditions will continue in 1993, many
analysts said they expected the company to record a first-quarter loss. Its
new earnings estimates for 1993 ranged from between Dollars 1.75 and Dollars
3.75, against a mean forecast before Tuesday's news of about Dollars 5.70.
Most analysts said the company was too fond of blaming economic conditions
while failing to react quickly to shifts in demand away from mainframe
computers to desktop models. One said it still needed to cut a further
50,000 employees.
The plunge in the share price was partly because of IBM's warning that its
Dollars 4.84 annual dividend was no longer secure. Its previous insistence
that it had no plans to cut the high yielding payout had helped put a floor
under the stock.
