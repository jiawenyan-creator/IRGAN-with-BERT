SEATTLE'S HUNTHAUSEN 'DELIGHTED,' 'RELIEVED'; 
VATICAN REVIEW CHANGED LITTLE, BISHOP SAYS 
Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen said that a five-year Vatican review of the 
Seattle Roman Catholic Archdiocese did not lead to fundamental changes in its 
operations. 
Hunthausen, who came under fire from Catholic conservatives and at one time 
temporarily lost his authority over annulments and in several other church 
activities, appeared with Seattle's coadjutor Archbishop Thomas Murphy at a 
news conference Wednesday. 
A day earlier, the Pope's U.S. representative announced that an apostolic 
commission that reviewed Hunthausen's leadership had completed its work. 
"We're delighted. We're relieved. We're pleased," Hunthausen said. "We're going 
to have a party." 
"I'm not sure the ministry has changed," said Hunthausen, 67, who added that 
the ministry was never in violation of Rome's teachings "in the broad sense." 
A statement issued by Archbishop Pio Laghi in Washington, D.C., chief papal 
representative in the United States, said Hunthausen "has indicated that he, 
along with Murphy, will continue to address the issues which have been of 
concern to the church." 
After Hunthausen came under fire from conservatives, the Vatican in 1985 
removed his authority in five areas where he was accused of diverging from 
church teachings, including ministry to homosexuals, liturgical matters and 
marriage annulments. An auxiliary bishop was named to perform those duties. 
When that situation proved unworkable, Hunthausen's authority was restored in 
early 1987 and Murphy was named coadjutor archbishop. 
Hunthausen has a national reputation for outspokenness on peace issues and the 
poor.
