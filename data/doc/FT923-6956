FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Accountancy book gets mixed reception as
sales soar
REACTION TO the book Accounting for Growth took several turns yesterday as
sales continued to escalate in City bookshops.
Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, which has as clients a number of
companies highlighted in the book, denounced it as 'misleading'.
The firm said the book's suggestion that companies using these techniques
were more likely to fail was 'unsupportable and highly dangerous,' and
raised 'serious questions over the quality of analysis in the City.'
Mr Terry Smith, the author, was suspended as head of UK research at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house, after pressing ahead with publication
of the book. It highlights a number of accounting practices used by
companies which he claims help improve their profits or reduce gearing on
the balance sheet.
Mr Smith has received a number of letters of support from investment
institutions.
Meanwhile, Mr Peter Smith, director of investments at Equity and Law, the UK
insurers, said he would insist that all seven of his UK fund managers read
the book. 'I want my chaps' eyes to be as wide open as they need to be.'
However, Interbrand, a firm specialising in valuing brands on company
balance sheets, was last night preparing a memorandum attacking the book for
circulation to more than 100 of its clients.
The negative reaction has, however, continued to have a positive effect on
sales.
Random House, the book's publisher, said it had last night authorised a
third print run of 4,000 copies, bringing the total number produced in
paperback to 16,000. Copies of a hardback version are now also on sale and
the publishers are considering expanding this print run of 750 copies.
