FT  16 MAY 92 / International Company News: Size of Fiat dividend cut
surprises
FIAT, the Italian cars and industrial group, surprised analysts yesterday
with a deeper than expected cut in its dividend for 1991.
The company cut its ordinary share dividend by almost 38 per cent to L230
from L370 in 1990. The payment on savings shares was cut by L140 to L260.
Net profits after minority interests fell to L1,114bn (Dollars 894.8m) from
L1,613bn. The result caused some confusion, largely because of the
unexplained drop in minority interests to L162bn from L523bn.
At the pre-tax level, around half of the L1,690bn profit made last year was
accounted for by extraordinary items, notably the sale of the Telettra
subsidiary.
Turnover rose by 1.4 per cent to L58,029bn. This figure includes Ford New
Holland, acquired last year and consolidated from May. Stripped of this
purchase, Fiat turnover fell by 1.3 per cent to L56,488bn.
Fiat, chaired by Mr Giovanni (Gianni) Agnelli, said the lower earnings
stemmed from slower economic growth and cut-throat competition at a time of
heavy investment.
Profits at the cars unit fell to L386bn from L751bn on turnover of L27,506bn
against L27,675bn. Unit sales slipped by 3 per cent to 2.06m.
Results in industrial vehicles, divided between Iveco (trucks) and NH
Geotech (farm and construction equipment), spotlighted the crisis in both
sectors.
Fiat's losses have been exacerbated by acquisitions in both areas. Swollen
by the purchase of Enasa in Spain, Iveco swung to a loss of L82bn, from
profits of L65bn. A L155bn loss at Ford New Holland hit Geotech, which
reported a a divisional loss of L452bn, up from L238bn. Losses at the
Magneti Marelli car components unit rose to L144bn from L35bn.
