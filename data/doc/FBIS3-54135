  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin says that any 
agreement with the Palestinians must ensure Israel's security 
and defense needs. Beilin told Qol Yisra'el that both Israel 
and the Palestinians would like to keep to their agreed 
timetable, and he believes this is possible. He foresees an 
agreement with the Palestinians within two weeks. 
  Regarding Syria, Beilin hoped that President al-Asad would 
not allow the death of his son to interfere with his declared 
desire to reach a peace settlement during the coming year. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1105 GMT on 23 January 
carries a live interview with Beilin, in which he is asked 
whether Israel can sign an agreement with Syria without knowing 
what its future regime holds for us. Beilin responds: "We rely 
on ourselves. That has always been our answer, regardless of 
whether we are signing an agreement with al-Sadat, 'Arafat, or 
any other leader. We are not disbanding our security forces, 
and we will make arrangements which contain sufficient 
guarantees so that even if there is a change in regime it will 
not affect us."]
