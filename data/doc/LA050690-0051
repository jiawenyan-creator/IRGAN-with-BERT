REPLACING QUAYLE WITH BAKER 
The Times article is interesting and insightful but you should not have stopped 
just there. 
The man who engineered the way for two Presidents, while concurrently placing 
himself in a variety of career-advancing government positions, is far too 
creative to allow his long-time friend and current President to select as his 
first running mate someone who could keep the mantle of supreme power away from 
Baker for an additional eight years. 
The real thinking, begun long ago -- and by Baker himself -- probably was: 
"I've done chief of staff, I've done Treasury, while I'm Vicar of State, I'll 
make sure that my last steppingstone to the presidency will be only temporarily 
occupied by a disposable VP." 
Such a man as President could be an ominous force in the White House. But is 
that good, or bad?
