FT  26 MAR 93 / World News in Brief: Loyalists murder five men as IRA bomb
victim dies
Terrorist violence continued unabated in Northern Ireland yesterday as the
IRA's Warrington bombing claimed another life. In Castlerock, north Antrim,
loyalist gunmen murdered four Roman Catholics arriving for work on a
building site. A fifth man was seriously injured. The outlawed Ulster
Freedom Fighters admitted the shootings and threatened to step up their
violence. Hours later, another Roman Catholic died after a shooting in a
west Belfast shop.
The killings came on the day 12-year-old Timothy Parry, who caught the full
force of the Warrington bomb blast last Saturday, died in Liverpool. In
their first joint statement on terrorism, Cardinals Basil Hume and Cahal
Daly, heads of the Roman Catholic church in England and Wales and Ireland,
condemned the Warrington bombing as 'barbaric'.
