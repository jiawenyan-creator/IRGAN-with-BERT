FT  16 APR 94 / Consumers 'less willing to buy'
Consumer confidence fell in March, reflecting potential unease before this
month's tax increases, a survey by the Birmingham Midshires Building Society
says.
The poll, by ICM Research, asks consumers about their intentions to make
substantial purchases, such as a car, a TV or a cooker, over the next six to
12 months. The figures are then converted into an index, which fell from 108
in February to 105 in March (August 1991=100).
