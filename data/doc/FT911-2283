FT  01 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Pledge on brewing industry
THE LABOUR Party promised a 'fresh start' review of competition, consumer
choice, and prices in the brewing industry, Philip Rawstorne writes.
Government orders introduced after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
report on the industry, had 'failed to stem the tide of takeovers and
closures,' said Mr Doug Henderson, a Labour trade and industry spokesman.
'The brewing industry is being carved up between giant retailing chains and
increasingly large brewers,' he said.
Government changes had done nothing to to cut the price of a pint or give
consumers greater choice of beers. Price rises in the brewing industry had
been 'staggering'.
Retail prices increased by 142 per cent between March 1979 and March 1991.
Beer prices rose by 222 per cent over the same period, he said.
