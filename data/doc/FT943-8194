FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Raine raises Dollars 40m for US building
offshoot
Raine, the UK housebuilder and contractor, has raised Dollars 40m (Pounds
25.8m) through a US private placement to help reduce the currency exposure
of West Venture, its Californian subsidiary.
The placement, arranged earlier this week by NatWest Markets, replaces a
Dollars 35m borrowing facility which was due to expire this year.
Funds from the placing will be held by the UK parent group, which oversees
West Venture's spending on its programme of building starter homes.
In the half year to December 31, the Californian housing operation reported
losses of Pounds 605,000, against profits of Pounds 819,000 previously.
Mr Peter Parkin, chairman, said the use of more structured financing would
considerably assist the subsidiary's longer term development.
The issue of 8.7 per cent guaranteed senior notes to Teachers Insurance &amp;
Annuity and John Hancock Mutual Life also marks a partial shift in strategy
from reliance on relatively short-term borrowings to more medium and
long-term finance.
It follows the group's decision last year to take on a 5-year syndicated
loan for Pounds 50m.
The two deals are expected to reduce Raine's dependence on borrowing
facilities maturing within one year. Last year such borrowing represented
Pounds 85.1m of the group's total facilities of Pounds 196.6m.
