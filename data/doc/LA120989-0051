BOESKY GETS A HAIRCUT, MOVES TO HALFWAY HOUSE IN BROOKLYN 
Wall Street inside trader Ivan F. Boesky is out of prison and serving the last 
part of his three-year sentence on the outside as a resident of a halfway 
house. 
Boesky reported to the Brooklyn Community Corrections Center on Wednesday. 
Boesky was sentenced Dec. 18, 1987, and has served his sentence at the minimum 
security prison at Lompoc, Calif. The former Wall Streeter was scheduled for 
release April 4, 1990. 
Boesky has shed the shaggy beard and long hair he was spotted sporting last 
month on a furlough in Connecticut. His beard and hair had been trimmed when he 
was seen returning to the halfway house in a rented auto just before the 6 p.m. 
deadline. 
If Boesky finds work, his curfew stretches to 9 p.m., and he will be eligible 
for a weekend pass. The once-powerful stock speculator, who agreed to pay $100 
million in penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle civil 
charges, would have to turn over 25% of his earnings to the halfway house.
