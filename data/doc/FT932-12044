FT  30 APR 93 / Collor to face corruption trial
BRAZIL's disgraced former President Fernando Collor is to undergo a criminal
trial for corruption which could lead to eight years in prison.
The Supreme Court voted unanimously on Wednesday night to admit the charges
recommended by the Attorney General against Mr Collor and eight of his
associates.
Mr Collor, who was suspended from office last September and impeached in
December on accusations of benefiting from a massive kickback scheme, will
be the first major Brazilian politician to undergo trial for corruption.
The Supreme Court decision is regarded as an important landmark towards
breaking the country's notorious reluctance to pursue high-level corruption.
But Mr Sydney Sanches, President of the Supreme Court, warned that it would
be a long trial. 'I think it will take more than a year because there are
many accused and lots of witnesses to hear,' he said.
Mr Collor will be tried for 'passive' corruption. The others facing trial
include Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's former campaign treasurer and
alleged frontman, and Mr Claudio Vieira, Mr Collor's former private
secretary, both accused of passive and active corruption, and suppression of
evidence.
The police chief heading investigations on the 'Collorgate' case has also
recommended charges against Ms Zelia Cardoso de Mello, the first economy
minister of the Collor government.
The main evidence in the case consists of the so-called corruptogram files
stored in Mr Farias's computer, now in police custody. These contain
detailed lists of kickbacks for government contracts.
