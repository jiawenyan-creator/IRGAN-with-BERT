  [Excerpts] The European Union [EU] will have three new 
members following the enlargement approved at a long and 
intensive session, which went on into the early hours of the 
morning. The EU will grow to 15 members with the agreement 
reached with Sweden, Finland, and Austria. [passage omitted] The 
Spanish minister of foreign affairs has stressed the importance 
which this enlargement has for our country. He also referred to 
the agreement signed in Washington by the Croats and Muslims: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The foreign affairs minister 
described as magnificent the Croat-Muslim agreement, the best 
news we have received in the past few months. In the early 
hours of Monday morning, Javier Solana learned that the 
negotiations were going well in a telephone conversation with 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Foreign Minister 
Solana says that peace is beginning to spread. 
  [Begin Solana recording] Allow me to say, too, however, that 
this is good for our Blue Helmets. Our Blue Helmets are 
deployed in a zone, the southern zone, that is the zone where 
this peace agreement is going to come into effect. So they are 
going to be able to carry out humanitarian work in better 
conditions, they are going to run fewer risks. I should also 
like to convey, therefore, a message of calm to the families who 
have troops there, because this agreement is also good for our 
blue helmets. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] With regard to the enlargement of the EU the 
Spanish Government takes a very positive view of the agreement 
reached last night with Finland, Austria, and Sweden because, 
according to Foreign Minister Solana, besides permitting an 
economically and politically stronger Europe, Spain's objectives 
have been saved. The foreign affairs minister stressed that our 
fruit and vegetables are going to find new markets, doubling 
their exports in some of them. Finally, however, there remains 
a warning to Norway. 
  [Begin Solana recording] We are left with a serious dispute 
with Norway, which is the fishing dispute. I have to say with 
the utmost clarity that, if this is not resolved, Norway will 
not be able join the EU.
