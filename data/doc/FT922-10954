FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Dow Corning suffers 15% decline
DOW Corning, the 50-50 joint venture between Dow Chemical and Corning that
is the world's biggest manufacturer of silicone breast implants, yesterday
reported a 15.6 per cent decline in first-quarter earnings, reflecting
charges related to the implants.
The Michigan-based company, which last month said it would withdraw from the
silicone implant business, had net income of Dollars 36.3m on sales of
Dollars 484m, against Dollars 43m on sales of Dollars 452m in the first
quarter of the previous year.
In the latest quarter, the company had Dollars 24m of expenses related to
breast implants, which Dow Corning said 'contributed largely to the
reduction in profits'.
A change in accounting standards contributed Dollars 16.4m towards Dow
Corning's earnings in the latest quarter.
Earlier this month the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sharply
restricted the use of silicone gel breast implants after an advisory panel
concluded that the devices had not been proved to be safe.
Mr Edward Steinhoff, chief financial officer, said the company does not
expect the breast implant issue to continue to affect profits at the same
rate.
Mr Steinhoff said the company's first-quarter sales parallelled the gradual
economic upturn in the US.
'Other major economies are slowing, however, but our good geographic balance
is helping Dow Corning maintain steady revenue growth,' he said.
Mr Steinhoff said sales growth in the US had been led by general silicone
activities.
'While the economic picture in Europe is gloomy now, we are well-poised to
take advantage of that area's longer-term prospects for growth with a
Dollars 300m expansion to our facilities in Barry, Wales,' Mr Steinhoff
added.
