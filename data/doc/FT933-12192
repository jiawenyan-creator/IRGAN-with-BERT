FT  26 JUL 93 / Change to injury payments law urged
AN EARLY day motion calling for changes to the law on compensation for
people injured at work is due to tabled in the Commons today, Diane Summers
writes.
The motion, piloted by Mr Keith Bradley, Labour social security spokesman,
and signed by 100 MPs, calls for section 22 of the 1989 Social Security Act
to be repealed. This allows the Department of Social Security to reclaim
welfare benefits paid to victims who win more than Pounds 2,500 damages in
legal cases against their employers.
The Trades Union Congress, which has been campaigning for the law to be
changed so that victims keep all the money awarded, says present rules
depress compensation levels and encourage insurers to delay cases. The TUC
argues that damages reclaimed by the DSS are awarded as compensation for
disablement, or as punitive damages.
