SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA; 
LOAN FOR ARMORY CENTER 
The Pasadena Board of Directors approved a $180,000 interest-free loan and a 
grant of $36,350 for the new Armory Center for the Visual Arts at its meeting 
Tuesday. 
The money will cover unanticipated costs arising from the renovation of the 
56-year-old National Guard building at 145 N. Raymond Ave. The center operates 
an art gallery and children's art program rent free in the city-owned building, 
which it rehabilitated and now maintains. 
Center Director Elisa Greben Crystal said the center received sufficient 
three-year fund-raising pledges to pay for the $630,000 renovation but lacked 
$184,716 due now for work already completed. The city also should pay for 
$36,350 worth of ceiling repairs because city officials failed to secure 
California Conservation Corps workers as promised, Crystal said. 
Mayor William Thomson and Director Bill Paparian objected to the grant and 
loan, saying that the city is also being asked to provide $84,568 to the Day 
One anti-drug program and $75,000 to Pasadena Planned Parenthood. 
The board agreed to fund the three but put a hold on aid to other nonprofit 
social service agencies until a city policy is formulated.
