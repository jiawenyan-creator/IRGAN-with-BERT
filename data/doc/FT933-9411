FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Charter Medical sells hospitals
CHARTER Medical, the US hospitals company which emerged from Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection last year, yesterday announced the Dollars 340m sale
of 10 hospitals as part of its efforts to reduce borrowings.
The sale of the 10 general acute care hospitals, to Quorum Health Group,
will leave the company with 78 psychiatric hospitals and a focus on mental
health care, Charter said.
Following its move to pay off Dollars 50m of senior debt recently, Charter
said the disposal would leave it with Dollars 429m of debt. In the three
months to the end of June, Charter's operating profits edged ahead on higher
turnover, from Dollars 63.5m to Dollars 66.3m.
However, the amortisation of charges related to its financial restructuring
last year, which followed a disastrous leveraged buy-out in 1988, led to a
net loss for the period of Dollars 5.3m. The amortisations will continue
until the end of 1995, Charter said.
Mr Mac Crawford, chairman, said: 'The sale is consistent with Charter's
previously-stated objective of reducing debt and its continued focus on
being a major provider of mental health care services.'
