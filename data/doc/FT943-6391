FT  30 AUG 94 / Germany warned by OECD on privatisation
Germany was yesterday warned by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) that it needed to privatise more quickly and sweep
aside subsidies which are costing around DM135bn (Pounds 55.7bn) a year,
writes Michael Lindemann. With inflation likely to fall to less than 2 per
cent by the middle of 1995, the OECD annual report also suggested there was
further scope for the Bundesbank to cut interest rates. 'Given the expected
disinflationary pressures and weak demand there is still a certain amount of
room for further interest rate cuts in order to shore up the recovery,' the
report said.
The Bundesbank should also provide a more comprehensive explanation of its
reliance on the broad money supply (M3) as a precursor of inflationary
pressures to avoid any 'erosion of confidence'. Uncharacteristically strong
language was also used to criticise the centralised wage bargaining system,
which effectively sets a minimum wage and keeps unemployment unnecessarily
high, and the government was urged to promote greater wage and working time
flexibility in the public sector. Other indicators suggested that the
economy's revival was making good progress and that only a worldwide rise in
interest rates and the continued strength of the D-Mark, already a thorny
subject with industry, could jeopardise the German recovery.
