"Sowing Under Threat"] 
  [Text] In connection with the crisis which has developed in 
the agro-industrial complex deputies of the Russian Federation 
Federal Assembly Federation Council have adopted an appeal to 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Government Chairman Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. It states, in particular: 
  "...In the space of two years the volume of agricultural 
production in Russia has fallen to 65-70 percent of the average 
annual level during 1986-1990. Seed production and pedigree 
livestock breeding have been destroyed. In terms of the numbers 
of cattle, hogs, and sheep the Russian Federation has been 
`thrust back' to the level of the sixties and seventies." 
  "...Owing to the inadequate growth in the prices of 
industrial and agricultural output, practically all farms have 
ended up insolvent. The implementation of all types of work 
connected with preparing for spring sowing has now been totally 
halted because of the financial crisis." 
  The Federation Council deputies ask the country's leadership 
to "examine without delay an entire package of questions to 
ensure the equivalent exchange of agricultural and industrial 
output and a radical change in tax, credit, and investment 
policy with regard to the agricultural sector." "It is 
extremely necessary for real state assistance to be given to the 
agro-industrial complex in the form of credit and 
material-technical resources before the start of the spring 
field work and with due regard for the seasonal nature of this 
work," the appeal states.
