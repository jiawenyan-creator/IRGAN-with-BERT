FT  08 DEC 93 / Latin America incomes 'need restoring'
Two out of every five Latin American city-dwellers are poor, while three in
five of the rural population live in poverty, according to a UN study
published recently, David Pilling writes from Santiago.
Throughout the 1980s income distribution worsened significantly as countries
adjusted to the effects of the debt crisis, according to the Social Panorama
report produced by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean (Cepal).
'This did not only affect homes on low incomes, deepening their poverty, but
also hit the middle classes who lost out relatively in terms of income
distribution.' The task of restoring middle class living standards is 'more
difficult and lengthy' than that of eradicating extreme poverty, according
to Cepal, since it requires much greater resources.
In the short term, Cepal says, governments need to tackle three areas:
restoring salaries in the formal sector to pre-1980s levels, raising
productivity and conditions in the informal sector and strengthening
inadequate social security and pension provisions.
'By different means and with varying intensity, Latin American governments
have made advances on all three fronts, although much remains to be done,'
the report says.
In the medium term, governments must develop 'human resources' through
fairer access to education, tackling youth unemployment and expanding
resources in rural areas.
