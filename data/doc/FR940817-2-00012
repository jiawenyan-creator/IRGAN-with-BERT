Commissioner of Customs, 


Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.




Dear Commissioner: Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854); and in
accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit,
effective on September 1, 1994, entry into the United States for consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption
of cotton textile products in Categories 347/348, produced or manufactured in Myanmar and exported during the period
beginning on September 1, 1994 and extending through August 31, 1995, in excess of 131,659 dozen.

Imports charged to this category limit for the period September 1, 1993 through August 31, 1994 shall be charged against
that level of restraint to the extent of any unfilled balance. Goods in excess of that limit shall be subject to the limit
established in this directive.

In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for
consumption to include entry for consumption into the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
