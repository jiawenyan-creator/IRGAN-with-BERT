VALDEZ PITCHES A PERFECT GAME FOR RIVERSIDE 
Right-hander Rafael Valdez pitched a perfect game Thursday night, the third in 
California League history, as the Riverside Red Wave beat the Reno Silver Sox 
2-0 in a class-A game at Riverside. 
Valdez (10-5) struck out eight. The 21-year-old from the Dominican Republic 
threw three balls to four batters, including a 3-0 count to one. He struck out 
three of those batters and got the other to pop out. 
Right fielder Tim McWilliams ended the game with a diving catch of Brian 
Bosco's looping fly ball. 
McWilliams went 4 for 4. The Red Waves scored their runs in the sixth inning on 
consecutive one-out singles by McWilliams, Guillermo Velasquez and Mike 
Humphreys, and a sacrifice fly by Isiah Clark.
