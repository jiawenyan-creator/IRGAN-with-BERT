FT  22 MAR 94 / Two Israeli soldiers killed by Hizbollah guerrillas
Hizbollah guerrillas yesterday killed two Israeli soldiers and two allied
militiamen in a series of attacks against Israel's occupation zone in south
Lebanon, Reuter reports from Marjayoun. Israeli reprisal shelling killed a
12-year-old schoolgirl and wounded 22 other school-children in the market
town of Nabatiyeh, witnesses said. Guerrillas firing anti-tank rockets and
machine guns ambushed an Israeli army patrol in the Rihan area just inside
the 15km deep zone. The pro-Iranian Hizbollah said five Israeli soldiers
were killed or wounded in the ambush.
