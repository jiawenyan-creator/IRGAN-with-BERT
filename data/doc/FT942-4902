FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: France warned on hotels bid
Forte of the UK yesterday received a boost in its battle to win control of
the Meridien hotel chain, as the European Commission appeared to warn the
French government against political interference in the sale.
Forte is pitted against Accor, the French hotel group, for control of
Meridien, which is 57 per cent owned by Air France. Forte's bid, supported
by the Meridien management, values the chain at FFr1.8bn (Dollars 317m).
Accor has submitted a bid which values it at FFr1.6bn, with the cash to be
provided by Prince al-Waleed of Saudi Arabia. The prince last week also
announced he would buy up to 24 per cent of the Euro Disney theme park.
Air France has referred the rival bids to the privatisation commission, an
independent body which advises the French government on privatisation
issues. The referral was seen as evidence of strong pressure on Air France
to sell Meridien to a French buyer.
The European Commission's warning appears in a letter to the French
government carried in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
The letter contains the Commission's comments on the French government's
plan to provide a FFr20bn capital injection to Air France.
It says: 'The Commission needs to be assured that the government will allow
Air France's management to run the companies of the group solely according
to commercial principles. . . . In this context, the Commission would refer
particularly to the disposal of certain non-core assets.'
Mr Gerard Pelisson, Accor's joint chairman, said Accor's bid should succeed,
even on purely commercial grounds. Forte declined to comment.
