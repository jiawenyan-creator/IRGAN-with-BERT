FT  29 JAN 94 / Beijing warns UK sharply on trade
China has issued its most pointed warning that the continuing row over Hong
Kong threatens commercial relations with Britain.
Miss Wu Yi, China's foreign trade minister, told reporters yesterday:
'Britain's unfriendly and unco-operative attitude in Hong Kong will
certainly affect normal trade.'
Her remarks were less equivocal than other official statements on the
subject, and indicate that China may be preparing to increase commercial
pressures on Britain.
The minister added it was not China's wish that business relations
deteriorate. 'This is not what we want to see. It is not the responsibility
of the Chinese side.'
British businessmen in Beijing say they are nervous about possible fall-out
from the continuing bitter argument over the democracy plans for Hong Kong
by the governor there, Mr Chris Patten. So far, though, there have been few
conspicuous examples of discrimination against UK companies.
One exception was the failure of British companies in a consortium led by
GEC-Alsthom to win a share of the first stage of the Guangzhou metro. The
contract went to Siemens of Germany.
Mr Zhu Senlin, Guangdong's governor, said then: 'Political and economic
co-operation between China and Britain cannot be separated.'
