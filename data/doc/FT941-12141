FT  01 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Miniaturisation is out of hand
Sir, Your supplement on Mobile Computing (January 26) highlighted the trend
among manufacturers to reduce progressively the size of portable computers
(laptop, notebook, sub-notebook, palm-top, etc). As the owner, of average
build, of a notebook, I can inform you that the speed of evolution of hand
sizes in the species homo sapiens is not keeping up]
