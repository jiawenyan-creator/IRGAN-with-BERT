FT  26 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Roads programme view faulty
Sir, In 'Quarries head for the coast' (March 23), Andrew Taylor succinctly
sums up the options put forward in the environment department's consultation
paper on minerals extraction (MPG6). However, the conclusion that forecast
demands for minerals will have to be met - either from Scottish
super-quarries or by increased dredging of marine aggregates - misses a key
issue: whether this is environmentally sustainable.
CPRE believes it is not and that we should be looking at ways to reduce our
demand for aggregates. We have to find ways of meeting our needs and
aspirations for goods and services in ways that use less building material.
A good place for the government to start would be by cutting its
road-building programme. New roads and road maintenance are major consumers
of aggregates. A shift in transport policy away from road construction would
help to reduce the number of holes threatening to appear in our coastline.
