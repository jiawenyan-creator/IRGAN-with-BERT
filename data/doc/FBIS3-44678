  [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Visiting chairman of 
the U.S. Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee Bennett 
Johnston said here today that it is "almost unthinkable not to 
give China MFN [most-favored nation] status" while China's 
economy is growing rapidly and the human rights situation here 
is improving. 
  He also called for the lifting of all U.S. sanctions on 
China 
so that American companies can compete in the growing China 
market. 
  Johnston made the remarks at a press briefing here this 
evening at the end of his delegation's two-day visit to Beijing. 
  During his stay here, Johnston said, the delegation had met 
Chinese Premier Li Peng and chairman of the Standing Committee 
of the Chinese National People's Congress Qiao Shi. 
  It also had discussions with Chinese officials from the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, the State 
Science and Technology Commission, and the Ministries of 
Electric Power and Coal, he said. 
  The China-U.S. relationship is the "single most important 
relationship", he said, adding that China is the fastest-growing 
nation and in the fastest-growing region in the world. 
  China has a great need for U.S. technology, he noted. "We 
wish more American technology and more U.S. dollars could be 
involved in China," he said. 
  He predicted that China would be part of the very 
competitive 
world market of the next century. "The nations successful 
economically in the next century will be those who compete 
successfully in China's market," he said. 
  On China's MFN status he stressed, "it is almost unthinkable 
not to give China MFN status."
