<F P=106> [Statement of the Tatarstan Unity and Progress Party: "The </F>
Socioeconomic Situation in the Republic of Tatarstan"] 
  [Text] Following the signing of the treaty between 
Tatarstan and Russia, the question of reform of the economy is 
moving toward the center of political processes. Considering the 
intensification of the crisis trends in the republic's economy 
(the slump in production, growth of nonpayments, deterioration 
in society's living standard, and so forth), the party, abiding 
by its program, deems it necessary to state the following: 
  For a strengthening of the economic security of the republic 
and a way out of the crisis a new economic policy in practice, 
not in words, is essential. This policy should include the 
following directions: 
  a structural reorganization of industry, including a 
solution 
of the problems of conversion and the development of high 
technology; 
  regulation of prices, pay, and tariffs, primarily in the 
base 
sectors; 
  an adjustment of the privatization program for the defense 
of 
the interests of the population of the republic; 
  an improvement in the banking and financial systems; 
  the formulation of a fiscal and tax policy stimulating 
production and an inflow of capital, with regard to the 
republic's obligations ensuing from the treaty with the Russian 
Federation; 
  reform of the state organs of administration; 
  the formulation of an effective social policy. 
  The party believes that the economic reforms should be 
accompanied by the continued democratization of society, 
including the assurance, in accordance with the Constitution of 
the Republic of Tatarstan, of the rights and responsibility of 
local government. Democratization also demands economic support 
of the press which guarantees its independence in the expression 
of the interests of the civil society.
