FT  22 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: JP Morgan tops OTC swaps poll
For the second year running, J. P. Morgan has topped the rankings of firms
in the over-the-counter swaps market, while Swiss Bank Corporation continues
to dominate the over-the-counter options market, according to a poll
published in September's Risk Magazine, a monthly publication specialising
in derivatives. More than 100 banks, investment houses and brokers were
polled in June and July.
Among their closest competitors, Credit Suisse Financial Products gained
ground in several areas, including currency swaps and options.
In the market for more complex or exotic derivatives such as 'differential'
swaps and look-back options, Bankers Trusts' pre-eminent position showed
signs of slipping. Although still ranked in each of the 10 categories,
Bankers was voted top of only six categories this year, possibly reflecting
adverse publicity due to corporate losses on swaps arranged by the bank.
The number of banks nominated rose in many areas, reflecting increased
competition in the derivatives market. However, domestic banks swept the
board for many individual swaps markets, including sterling, French francs
and Swiss francs, suggesting that it is still possible to conduct successful
swaps business in niche areas.
Among derivatives brokers, Intercapital and Tullet &amp; Tokyo dominated the
field, with Intercapital particularly strong in interest rate and equity
products and Tullet well ahead in forward rate agreements.
