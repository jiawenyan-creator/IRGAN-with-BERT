FT  23 FEB 94 / Arts: Today's Television
It has taken almost the entire series of The Day Today to get used to its
peculiar mixture. The pastiche, such as Christopher Morris's habitual
caricature of Paxman, was hilarious from the outset.
Other aspects, especially the pantomime elements (police clamping the
homeless, say) seemed out of place. In the end it is a very funny series
which happens to take news and current affairs television as its subject
matter (9.15 BBC2).
Jayne Zito's husband was fatally stabbed 14 months ago by a schizophrenic
who had been 'released into the community'. Since then there have been at
least 14 other cases of killings by the mentally ill. Dispatches examines
the dangers in the government policy of releasing so many patients from
mental institutions (9.00 C4).
The producer of The Underworld apparently believes that this series 'in no
way glamorises crime'. Yet that is, of course, precisely what it does,
repeatedly and emphatically. The second episode (9.30 BBC1) deals with the
Richardson and Kray gangs in London in the 1960s.
