FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Scots mark out the battleground
SCOTLAND is almost a separate battleground in this general election. In the
four-party cauldron of Scottish politics, several conflicts rage, cutting
across each other on an electoral map where, even by UK standards, the
number of seats won is often far out of line with the votes cast.
These are the two main battles: first, the Conservatives, who have ruled
Scotland for the last 13 years with a dwindling minority of the country's 72
MPs, are fighting to preserve their last nine seats against both Labour and
the Scottish National party.
Second, the Labour party, the largest with 48 seats, is facing a challenge
from the SNP which, holding only five seats, hopes at last to seriously dent
Labour's power in the central belt of the country.
Both Labour and the Conservatives need every Scottish seat they can get in a
close UK election. Meanwhile along the rural fringes the Liberal Democrats
are defending 10 seats, mainly against the Tories.
The most clear-cut issue north of the border is the question of Scotland's
constitutional future. Although to most individual voters it is less
important than unemployment, health, education and the economy, to some it
offers the solution to all these things. Scots are being offered
independence by the SNP, a devolved Scottish parliament by both Labour and
the Liberal Democrats, and the status quo by the Tories.
Though the constitutional issue could decide the outcome in several seats,
the election in Scotland will not in itself decide the constitutional
outcome. That will be determined by who wins the election at the UK level,
with the important exception that if the SNP wins a majority of the Scottish
seats (37), it will claim a mandate to negotiate independence.
The Scottish Conservative party could easily suffer disaster. It is
unpopular because it has ignored its minority position and imposed on
Scotland policies which most Scots did not vote for, notoriously the poll
tax. It is seen in Scotland as the English party because it has always
opposed devolution.
Last November the Tories, after losing Kincardine and Deeside to the Liberal
Democrats in a by-election, began a high-risk strategy aimed at dividing the
opposition.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, insisted that the only constitutional
choice was between the status quo and independence. He attacked Labour and
the Liberal Democrats and largely spared the SNP. He calculated that if
support for the SNP rose, the anti-Tory vote would be redistributed and the
Tories, who do not hold a majority of the vote in any of their
constituencies, could save seats or even win some from Labour.
A switch from Labour to the SNP could enable the Tories to hold their two
most vulnerable seats, Ayr, where they defend a majority of only 182, and
Stirling, where Mr Michael Forsyth, the Scottish education and health
minister, has a majority of 548, and even win others.
But the cost of boosting the SNP is that it puts rural Conservative seats at
risk. The ripest plum is Mr Lang's own seat in Galloway and Upper Nithsdale
(majority 3,673). Next come Sir Nicholas Fairbairn's in Perth and Kinross,
and then Mr Bill Walker's Tayside North. At the end of January an ICM poll
showed support for independence at 50 per cent, with Labour down to 38 per
cent and the SNP on 26 per cent. But backing for independence has since
fallen and Labour has recovered to 42 per cent. Last week ICM put the Tories
down five points at 18 per cent. If that poll were replicated on April 9,
not only would Labour would win Ayr and Stirling, but the SNP would take the
three rural Tory seats.
Yesterday's Mori poll for the Sunday Times was slightly more encouraging for
Scottish Tories, putting them on 23 per cent, one point below the SNP. On
those figures there could be fewer gains against the Tories (they won 10
seats with 24 per cent of vote in 1987).
Labour enters the campaign with confidence. Backing for a Scottish
parliament has recovered to around 45 per cent.
The electoral arithmetic is against the SNP in Labour's heartland. Because
Labour has vast majorities in most of its constituencies, the Nationalists
need to win around 35 per cent of the vote before they start winning many
Labour seats.
Labour's nightmare is if Mr John Major returns to Downing Street on the
strength of English votes. Labour voters might then flock to the SNP.
