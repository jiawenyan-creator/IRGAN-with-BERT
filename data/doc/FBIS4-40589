  [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev got a letter on Friday from United States 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher with information about 
ex-President Jimmy Carter's trip to North Korea. Kozyrev told 
State Duma deputies that the letter was evidence of "an 
intensive exchange of information through diplomatic channels" 
about the situation on the Korean peninsula. 
  The former U.S. President met with the higher leadership of 
North Korea, including President Kim Il-song. As Christopher's 
message states, Carter's private mission seems to have given 
rise to some hope that the North Korean side is closer to an 
agreement with the world community concerning verification of 
its nuclear sites. 
  "I think that can only be welcomed," said Kozyrev. He also 
added that Christopher, besides describing the results of the 
mission, cautioned that all the circumstances have yet to be 
made completely clear.
