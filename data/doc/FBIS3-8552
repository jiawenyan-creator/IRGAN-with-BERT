  [Text] Warsaw, 10 Mar -- Poland did not abstain from voting 
in Geneva on a resolution demanding that China observe human 
rights -- it only supported a motion tabled by the delegation of 
the People's Republic of China that no vote should be taken on 
this resolution, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Stanislaw 
Szymanski told the Sejm on Thursday [10 March]. 
  A question regarding the motives of the Polish stand was put 
by deputies Bogdan Borusewicz, Henryk Wujec, and Andrzej Potocki 
(UD) [Democratic Union]. 
  Szymanski assured his listeners that had a vote on the 
resolution been taken Poland would certainly not have voted 
against it. "Poland attaches importance to human rights but 
there are matters which are complicated and difficult to assess, 
which make it impossible to take an unequivocal decision," said 
Szymanski. He reported that the resolution on China contained, 
for the first time, mentions of Tibet, not only in the context 
of human rights. He added that the UN Commission of Human 
Rights did not have a mandate to involve itself with territorial 
and political problems. 
  "I know nothing about a representative of China at the 
United 
Nations commission informing a Polish representative a day 
before the voting that he would be receiving instructions from 
Warsaw to abstain from voting," said Szymanski. At the request 
of the UD deputies he revealed which countries had taken the 
same stand as Poland regarding the resolution. These include, 
among others, Barbados, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Cyprus, 
Ecuador, Lesotho, Mauritius, Mexico, Peru, Romania, Uruguay, and 
Venezuela.
