the name of the party is an ancient Turkish symbol, which shows 
the unity and integrity of the state. "Our party has nothing in 
common with nationalist party functioning in Turkey". According 
to Akhmedov, "Boz Gurd" is an opposition party but does support 
a political struggle during wartime conditions.

country.
