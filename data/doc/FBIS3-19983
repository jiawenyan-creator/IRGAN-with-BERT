Candidate List"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 23 -- Police from the Digos 
political division this morning went to the Rome national 
headquarters of the Forza Italia (Go Italy) party of media 
tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, to request a list of their candidates 
for this Sunday [27 March] and Monday's general elections, on a 
request from Palmi Assistant Prosecutor Maria Grazia Omboni, 
Forza Italia attorney Cesare Preveti said. 
  (The prosecutor, who is heading an investigation into 
illegal 
activities by certain free mason lodges in Calabria, refused to 
confirm or deny the request while another assistant prosecutor, 
Carlo Macri, said in Palmi that he knew nothing of a request for 
the Forza Italia document and "if this is true, then it is very 
serious that I don't know anything".) 
  Previti, who is also a candidate for the upcoming vote, told 
the press how the requested list had "naturally" been given to 
the Digos police "...but I must add how it had also been 
registered with the Ministry of the Interior and so, if one 
wanted to avoid such a spectacular scene, they (Digos) needed 
only file a request with the ministry." 
  The Forza Italia attorney went on to express his surprise 
for 
such an initiative, also in light of the polemics yesterday over 
insinuation made, and later denied, by the chairman of 
Parliament's Anti-Mafia Commission, Luciano Violante, that 
Berlusconi's party had links with the Mafia to which Berlusconi 
filed a complaint of bias to the speakers of the Houses, 
demanding that Violante he suspended from his institutional post. 
  Asked whether he thought the sending of the Digos to Forza 
Italia headquarters was part of a "single design" against the 
party, Previti said "this is a maneuver orchestrated by the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left], if Violante is a member of the 
PDS leadership, against us." 
  He then added "First they tried to link us with the Mafia, 
and now with the Free Masons, let's see who we'll be linked with 
in the next couple of days."
