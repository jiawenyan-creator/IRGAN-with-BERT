FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Fujita hit by Tokyo property
downturn
Fujita Corporation, a second-tier Japanese construction company, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits down 44 per cent to Y18.77bn (Dollars 179m) for the
year ended March.
The company said the downturn reflected the poor state of the domestic
property market. Fujita is particularly exposed to the badly-hit Tokyo
property market.
Fujita warned it would be forced to cut its dividend in the current year
from Y10 per share to Y7.5.
'We faced tough times because of the fall in orders for plant and office
buildings from the private sector, although public works orders and
investment in new homes were firm,' said the company.
Group turnover fell 14.4 per cent to Y727bn, while post-tax profits tumbled
39 per cent to Y8.6bn. Earnings per share declined to Y17.46 from Y28.54.
The group said it expected construction orders to remain slow during the
current year because private companies were unlikely to increase capital
investment.
It forecast that pre-tax profits for the year ending next March would fall
further to Y12bn.
Earnings per share would fall to Y13.15, but sales would increase to Y750bn.
