FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: First loss for Sears, Roebuck
SEARS, Roebuck, the US retail and insurance group, yesterday reported its
first quarterly loss in its 106-year history.
Claims related to Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki battered its Allstate unit and
charges related to settlement of a lawsuit dented income in its huge
Merchandising Group.
A previously-reported after-tax charge of Dollars 1.2bn at Allstate
contributed to a loss of Dollars 833.7m, or Dollars 2.25 per common share
for Sears in the third quarter. That compares with a 1991 third-quarter gain
of Dollars 229.2m or 67 cents.
Allstate suffered a third-quarter loss of Dollars 840.2m, compared with
earnings of Dollars 158.2m last year, after taking the charge to cover
hurricane-related claims. Allstate's revenues rose slightly, to Dollars
4.07bn, compared with Dollars 4.96bn last time.
The group's results included a Dollars 20.5m third-quarter write-off of
Sears' investment in Phar-Mor, a discount drug store in bankruptcy
reorganisation.
For the first nine months, Sears suffered a consolidated net loss of Dollars
166.1m, or 51 cents, compared with net income of Dollars 765.8m, or Dollars
2.23, last time.
Sales in the third quarter were Dollars 14.49bn, up 1.3 per cent from
Dollars 14.3bn last year.
The Merchandising Group, the retailing heart of the company, reported a
third-quarter loss of Dollars 36.4m, compared with income of Dollars 54.4m
last year. It lost about Dollars 80m in revenues and took a Dollars 27m
after-tax charge after settling a case involving customer overcharges at
Sears' car service stores. Its sales edged up to Dollars 7.71bn from Dollars
7.66bn in 1991.
The Dean Witter Financial Services Group income rose 24.1 per cent in the
quarter, to Dollars 114.3m, up from Dollars 92.1m in 1991. Sales were
Dollars 1.3bn, from Dollars 1.25bn last year.
Sear's Coldwell Banker real estate group had third-quarter income of Dollars
20.2m, up from Dollars 5.5m last time. Sears said the gain primarily
reflected the timing of property sales at Homart Development. Coldwell
Banker sales were up 1.8 per cent to Dollars 455.8m, from 447.9m.
