FT  11 NOV 92 / MacSharry back as EC ends row
MR RAY MACSHARRY last night withdrew his resignation as the European
Commission's farm trade negotiator after burying his differences with Mr
Jacques Delors, commission president.
The move came as worldwide pressure grew to avert an EC-US trade war and to
bring about an accord on world trade reforms.
Mr MacSharry, the Irish commissioner in charge of EC agriculture, angrily
relinquished his role as farm trade negotiator last week. He accused Mr
Delors of undermining his position in talks with the US, while Mr Delors and
France suggested Mr MacSharry was exceeding his mandate.
Their differences were put aside in Brussels talks aimed at avoiding open
conflict at a full meeting of the commission today.
The commissioners were instructed by EC foreign ministers on Monday to end
their row. Mr Delors risked isolation, with most of the 16-member commission
favouring an urgent resumption of talks with the US.
Mr MacSharry confirmed last night that he would be resuming talks with the
US on their dispute over European subsidies to oilseeds farmers which has
blocked a Uruguay Round accord on broad world trade reforms.
Yesterday negotiators from more than 50 countries, meeting in Geneva,
appealed to the EC and the US to settle their differences. They mandated Mr
Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, to intervene.
Downing Street last night welcomed Mr MacSharry's return as a helpful sign.
The trade talks will be a priority when Mr John Major meets German
chancellor Helmut Kohl today.
