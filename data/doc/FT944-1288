FT  21 DEC 94 / People: Chadwick goes from Leeds Permanent
Chris Chadwick, commercial director of Leeds Permanent Building Society, has
resigned from the society's board; he will leave formally at the end of
January.
Chadwick, 42, has been one of three senior executives running the UK's fifth
largest society since its previous chief executive, Mike Blackburn, left to
run Halifax Building Society.
When the plans for a merger between Leeds Permanent and Halifax were
announced last month, the other two members of the executive troika - Roger
Boyes, finance director, and John Miller, information systems director -
were both named as members of the combined board. Chadwick, right, was not.
Leeds Permanent was unable to say whether he would receive any severance
pay.
Chadwick has been with the society since 1989, with a background in other
areas of the UK personal financial services sector. He was a founding
director of Burton Group Financial Services, and has also worked for
American Express.
