FT  13 FEB 92 / Pledge on early end to CFC production
THE UK will stop making ozone-destroying chemicals by the end of 1995, the
Department of the Environment and ICI, the country's largest chemical
manufacturer, said yesterday, Clive Cookson writes.
That will be two years ahead of the European Community deadline and five
years ahead of the internationally agreed Montreal Protocol.
The commitment matches the announcement by President Bush on Tuesday that
the US would stop producing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the chemicals
causing most damage to the earth's protective ozone layer, by the end of
1995.
Both countries are accelerating the phasing out of CFCs in the light of new
evidence that the upper atmosphere is losing ozone far more rapidly than
scientists had realised previously.
Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, the environmental groups, said it was
not enough for the UK just to echo the new US timetable. Ms Tracy Heslop of
Greenpeace called for an immediate ban.
Mr John Beckett, who is managing ICI's phase-out of CFCs, said an immediate
halt was not practical because many users, particularly in the refrigeration
industry, still had no available substitutes.
