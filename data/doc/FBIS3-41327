  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Yesterday, in one of his first 
acts as attorney general of the republic, Diego Valades 
initiated the preliminary phase of the Short-Term Program for 
Antidrug Action in Central America. Plans will emerge from it 
for international cooperation in the battle against this social 
cancer, as well as for prevention and rehabilitation programs. 
The topics to be analyzed will be: each country's problems, 
structures, and programs for national agencies, regional and 
subregional cooperation to curb illicit drug trafficking, 
intelligence coordinating centers, training, organization of 
statistical systems, legislative harmonization, money 
laundering, and drug prevention and rehabilitation. After 
stating that the drug problem cannot be attacked in an isolated 
manner, the PGR [Office of the Attorney General of the Republic] 
director stressed the urgent need to reinforce plans for 
cooperation among the nations of the region. [passage omitted]
