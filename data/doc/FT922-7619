FT  16 MAY 92 / Ulster talks at risk in row over leak
A ROW over the leaking of nationalists' plans for Northern Ireland
overshadowed negotiations yesterday on the province's future and reduced
still further the chance of success in the 'round table' talks in Belfast.
After an incident that deepened distrust between Unionists and the mainly
Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the
Northern Ireland secretary, said the leak 'must have been calculated . . .
to frustrate the talks'.
His statement after a plenary session and bilateral meetings with the party
leaders suggested that the day's exchanges had been dominated by the leak
and had led to a fresh delay before real issues are debated. Last year's
talks initiative failed because of similar seemingly small but deeply
symbolic rows. A further plenary session has been called for Monday.
The SDLP proposed the appointment of six commissioners for Northern Ireland.
Three would be elected locally and one each by the UK and Irish governments
and the European Community.
The plan has horrified Unionists - if only because of Dublin's enhanced role
in the province's affairs - and the leaking of the SDLP document has
increased pressure on Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the
Unionist leaders, from their more extreme supporters to resist concessions
to the SDLP.
Sir Patrick's statement was, however, agreed by all the party leaders. He
said: 'For my own part I'm wholly satisfied that anyone who leaked this
document had no vestige of authority to do so on behalf of any political
party.'
