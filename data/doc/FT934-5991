FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: Lawson Mardon earnings decline
by 5.8%
Lawson Mardon, the Toronto-based packaging group which is the object of a
takeover bid by Switzerland's Alusuisse-Lonza Holdings, has blamed deepening
recession in Europe and unfavourable exchange rates for a 5.8 per cent drop
in nine-month operating earnings.
Net earnings increased to CDollars 14.3m (USDollars 10.8m) or 36 cents a
share, from CDollars 4.9m, or 17 cents a year earlier. But last year's
figure included a restructuring charge of CDollars 15m.
Sales were fractionally lower at CDollars 951.4m.
Alusuisse said earlier this month that it plans to offer CDollars 555m, or
CDollars 14 a share, for all Lawson's outstanding shares. Cragnotti and
Partners, the Italian investment group, has agreed to tender its 32.7 per
cent stake, which is equal to a 52.6 per cent voting interest.
Alusuisse's bid, which would be a substantial premium on the earlier market
price, is subject to a due diligence examination. This is presently underway
and is expected to be completed by the end of December.
Third-quarter earnings were CDollars 4.3m, up from CDollars 3.8m a year
earlier. Primary per-share earnings amounted to 11 cents, against 13 cents
previously. Sales were CDollars 330.2m, against CDollars 327.9m a year
earlier.
Slack economic activity in Germany, France and Spain has encouraged
customers to run down inventories and cut back on purchases. About
four-fifths of Lawson's sales are in Europe. The UK is its biggest market.
Mr Andrea Mattiussi, chief executive, said the company is responding to the
tough climate by cutting costs and tightening its focus on its three core
businesses of flexible packaging, folding cartons and labels.
