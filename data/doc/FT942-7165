FT  26 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold demand falls
Demand for gold in markets covered by the World Gold Council fell by about
25 per cent in the first quarter compared with the same months a year ago,
from 693.2 tonnes to 514.2 tonnes, the producers' organisation reported
yesterday, writes Kenneth Gooding, mining correspondent.
In early 1993 gold prices in US dollar terms touched a seven-year low and
demand was also boosted by import liberalisation in India where the number
of jewellery shops consequently increased tenfold, the council pointed out.
The market was returning to normality and demand was holding up well, it
said in its latest Gold Demand Trends publication.
The markets monitored by the council represent about 75 per cent of total
world demand.
Among the price-sensitive 'developing markets' demand in India was down from
153.1 tonnes in the first quarter of 1993 to 82.5 tonnes this year; in
'Greater China' - which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan - it was down from
166.8 to 103.3 tonnes; and in the Gulf states it fell from 73 to 49.6
tonnes. In Turkey, where the market was hit by political uncertainty and
devaluation of the local currency, demand fell from 32.7 to 12 tonnes.
In the developed markets, demand in the US was flat, at 57.5 tonnes compared
with 58.8 tonnes, while in Japan it fell from 55.2 to 49.1 tonnes. Most
European markets were flat in the first quarter except for Italy, also
affected by political uncertainties, where demand fell from 20 to 17.1
tonnes.
