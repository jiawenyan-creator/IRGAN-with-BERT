FT  11 JUN 92 / Doubt caston future of 'multiple directors'
NON-EXECUTIVE directors would no longer be able to serve on more than one
board because of greater obligations suggested in recent proposals, Sir
Adrian Cadbury said yesterday.
'The days of the multiple director are over,' said Sir Adrian, chairman of
the corporate governance committee which last week proposed that
non-executives be given greater responsibilities. As a result, he said, a
presence on more than one board will cause strains on time and efficiency.
Sir Adrian, speaking at a Confederation of British Industry conference on
corporate governance, said his committee's proposals meant that far more
individuals would have to serve as non-executives than at present.
'The current network system (of selecting non-executives) draws on the
narrow pool. That must be changed and we must look to non-traditional
sources for non-executives,' he said.
The Cadbury Committee on Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance
recommended a voluntary code of practice for boards of directors,
accountants and auditors.
It urged that audit committees be composed solely of non-executives, that
non-executives should have no financial, or personal interest in the company
and that they be allowed to solicit independent advice on board decisions at
company expense.
The committee, initiated by the accountancy profession and the Stock
Exchange, is backed by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Bank of
England.
Separately, the government signalled yesterday that if the voluntary code
urged by the committee appeared to be having little effect, it would
consider regulations.
'If a sufficiently strong case for further action were to emerge, taking
into account the wider issues which the Department (of Trade and Industry)
has to consider, the government would not be true to its past record if it
did not take action,' he said.
