FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Strong advance at CS Holding
CS Holding, the financial services and industrial group built around the
Credit Suisse bank, has reported a 69 per cent jump in net profit to
SFr1.99bn (Dollars 1.4m) for 1993, due mainly to outstanding earnings
generated by commission and trading business.
The group's preliminary statement revealed assets 39 per cent higher at
SFr346.5bn during 1993, largely because of the acquisition of Swiss
Volksbank, Switzerland's fourth largest bank. Group equity jumped 47 per
cent to SFr15.8bn at the year end.
The figures confirm CS as the largest Swiss financial group, surpassing
Union Bank of Switzerland with assets of SFr311.3bn at the year end. Swiss
Bank Corporation, the third largest, had assets of SFr207bn. UBS is the most
profitable of the three, with net income last year of SFr2.27bn, and is the
group with the largest equity base, SFr21.7bn.
Volksbank, which was on the verge of collapse before being taken over, did
not contribute to CS group profits last year.
CS said its operating profit from trading in foreign exchange, precious
metals and securities more than doubled to SFr5.2bn from SFr2.3bn while net
commission income advanced 40 per cent to SFr4.5bn. Net interest income grew
19 per cent to SFr3.2bn because of the inclusion of Volksbank activities.
Group cash flow expanded 78 per cent to SFr5.26bn, but provisions for bad
loans and depreciation soared 84 per cent to SFr3.26bn. Return on equity was
14.3 per cent or 13.2 per cent after deduction of minority interests.
The directors will make a dividend recommendation following the closing of
the CS financial year at the end of March.
