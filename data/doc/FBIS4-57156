  [Text] Upon returning from Costa Rica yesterday, President 
Ramiro De Leon Carpio was asked if the people responsible for 
the loss of food and medicine in Santo Tomas de Castillo would 
be punished and if charges would be filed against the health 
minister. The president reiterated that fighting corruption is 
one of his government's main objectives. He said: "If there is 
one thing my administration has tried to do from the very 
beginning, it is to combat negligence and violations of the 
country's laws." 
  The president added that the struggle against corruption is 
being conducted at all levels in his government, thus the law 
will be applied to anyone who has committed a crime. He 
recalled that the government's position has been reiterated 
several times, so those who are guilty of negligence must answer 
before a court of law and be punished according to the law. 
  President De Leon Carpio did not elaborate on the issue but 
clearly established that the government's position on the health 
problem is to minimize its negative effects on the population. 
  Political analysts have stated that the government must 
await 
the results of the investigation, which is headed by Deputy 
Health Minister Enrique Eugenio and expected to conclude in 15 
days, before any measures can be taken against the culprits.
