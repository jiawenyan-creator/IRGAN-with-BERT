Miami may be without its leading receiver and punt returner Saturday night when 
it plays No.1-ranked Notre Dame. 
Wesley Carroll, who has 53 receptions for 770 yards and 32 punt returns for 381 
yards, separated a shoulder last Saturday in the Hurricanes' 42-6 win over San 
Diego State and is listed as doubtful for Saturday's game at Miami.
