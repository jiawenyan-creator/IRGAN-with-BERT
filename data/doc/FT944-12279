FT  02 NOV 94 / Observer: Tooth decay
The chairman of Amstrad is not known for honeyed language. But Alan Sugar's
statement to the stock exchange yesterday, announcing the sacking of Ossie
Ardiles, Tottenham Hotspur's manager - Sugar is also chairman of the
football club - laid it on with a trowel.
The sacking was 'one of the most difficult decisions I have ever had to make
in my life', said Sugar. Praising Ardiles rather than burying him, Sugar
added: 'The difficulty has been compounded by the fact that he is such a
delightful person and a good man . . . he will always be loved and welcome
at our club.'
Can we stand this Mr Nice Guy act? Those with memories will recall Sugar's
rather different view of Ardiles last year.
Then the Argentine said that Terry Venables - the former Spurs chief
executive and manager who was contesting an unfair dismissal claim against
Sugar - was welcome at the club. Sugar was a little less effusive: 'Ossie is
in cloud-cuckoo land at the moment. Maybe he is getting carried away with
the results.'
Now he's just getting carted off.
