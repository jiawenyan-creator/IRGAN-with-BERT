  [Text] Khartoum, 6 Jun (MENA)--An official Sudanese source 
admitted today that an Egyptian irrigation delegation was 
recently denied entry to Sudan. The source justified this by 
saying the delegation came to Khartoum on its own initiative, 
not at the invitation of the Sudanese Government. 
  Sudan had invited irrigation experts in Egypt to discuss a 
number of cooperation projects between the two countries, but it 
did not allow the delegation to enter and gave no reason. The 
delegation returned on the same plane. 
  It is known that Sudan recently seized a number of buildings 
where Egyptian irrigation engineers lived in the Sudanese 
capital.
