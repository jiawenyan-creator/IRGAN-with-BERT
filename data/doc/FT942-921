FT  27 JUN 94 / Observer: Diouf's manna
Almost six months after taking over as director-general of the UN's largest
specialised agency, the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation,
Jacques Diouf has just met the press.
He announced a shake-up for the FAO, with plans to winkle out 200 of the
FAO's 1,500 Rome-based experts from their dolce vita, shifting them to the
capitals - and, horror of horrors, perhaps even the fields - of Africa and
Asia.
Could Diouf be implying some criticism of his long-standing predecessor,
Edouard Saouma? asked one diffident hack.
Hardly: 'I am not here to make judgments,' replied Diouf. Not even about the
sense of keeping the remaining 1,300 experts beavering away in Rome?
