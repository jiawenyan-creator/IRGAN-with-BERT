SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



The Privacy Act of 1974, at 5 U.S.C. 552a(b), states that ``No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in
a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request
by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains ***'' unless disclosure
would be made pursuant to one of the Act's 12 exceptions.

The Board, established by the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA), maintains records similar
to records of other Federal agencies and a Government-wide system of records on current and former participants in
the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). The TSP is a tax-deferred retirement plan for Federal employees that has approximately
2 million participants. The Department of Agriculture, National Finance Center, Thrift Savings Plan Service Office
is the recordkeeper for TSP records subject to the Privacy Act.

Under current Board rules developed pursuant to the Privacy Act, ``An individual who wishes to have a person of his
or her choosing review a record or obtain a copy of a record from the Board shall submit an originally signed statement
authorizing the disclosure of his or her record before the record will be disclosed.'' The Board's recordkeeper typically
receives authorizations executed by participants who want a record disclosed to a financial institution so that
they may qualify for a mortgage loan.

Based on the Board's experience in administering its Privacy Act record systems, submission of an originally signed
authorization to disclose a record is not necessary because no significant safeguard results from this requirement.
In addition, the requirement to submit an originally signed authorization is burdensome to the recordkeeper and
to the participants. The Board, therefore, proposes to amend its Privacy Act rules to allow disclosure of a record
about an individual upon receipt of a statement signed by the individual authorizing disclosure of his or her record.



Other Matters



This rule is not a major rule for the purpose of Executive Order 12291 of February 17, 1981. As required by the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, it is hereby certified that this rule will not have a significant impact on small business entities.
