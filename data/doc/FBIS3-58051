  [Text] Wiesbaden (DPA) -- The Federal Statistical Office in 
Wiesbaden announced its job figures today. During the course of 
a year, 696,000 jobs were lost in western Germany. The number 
of people employed in former West Germany fell by 2.4 percent to 
almost 28.5 million between November 1992 and November 1993. 
  From October to November 1993 alone, the number of people 
employed in the west fell by 167,000. That can be partially 
explained, however, by the usual seasonal drop, according to the 
statisticians. After seasonal adjustments, however, 67,000 jobs 
were still lost during this period. The Federal Statistical 
Office has no figures for former East Germany.
