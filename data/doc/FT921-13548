FT  21 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway overtakes UK in North
Sea output
NORWAY HAS overtaken Britain as Europe's biggest offshore producer of crude
oil and natural gas liquids, according to a report issued by Edinburgh-based
brokerage house County NatWest WoodMac, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
Last year Norway's crude oil and gas liquids production climbed to a record
1.94m barrels a day, a 13 per cent rise over 1990's daily average production
of 1.72m barrels and confirming an earlier forecast by County.
According to the report, North Sea offshore oil/gas liquids production rose
4 per cent in 1991 to a record 3.89m barrels a day and average total North
Sea gas production reached a record 9.98bn cu ft a day. Norway's aggregate
level of oil/NGL and gas production advanced 12 per cent in 1991 to 876m
barrels of oil equivalent.
Exploration activity off the coast of Norway increased by 34 per cent, with
a total of 43 exploration and appraisal wells drilled. Nine discoveries were
made out of 28 exploration wells drilled, giving a success rate of 32 per
cent.
Some 23m barrels of oil equivalent per exploration well was discovered, on a
par with 1990's result, County's report said, adding: '1991 can be
considered to have been a reasonably successful year for exploration on the
Norwegian shelf with substantial new reserves of both oil and gas being
found.' The report concluded that discoveries and reserves' upgrades led to
a total increase in Norway's reserve base of about 920m barrels of oil
equivalent, closely matching aggregate production in 1991.
