FT  24 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Vereinsbank taps Czech
fixed-rate debt sector
Bayerische Vereinsbank has become the first foreign bank to tap the Czech
koruna fixed-rate debt market, launching a Kcs1bn issue with a three-year
maturity and a coupon of 11 per cent.
The issue, through a subsidiary - BV Finance Praha - and guaranteed by
Vereinsbank's Prague branch, was placed with domestic and international
banks and was priced at 101.45 per cent.
The bank will use the proceeds for Czech koruna lending. It said it had
tapped the Czech koruna market to eliminate currency risk.
Prague has an active and liquid short-term money market but access to
long-term capital is difficult.
'Three-year money doesn't exist in the (Czech) interbank market,' said Mr
David Svojitka, Vereinsbank treasurer in Prague.
'This is the only way to get long-term money at a reasonable price. The
market was hungry for a new instrument at an attractive yield.'
Domestic companies and the Czech Republic have previously issued Czech
koruna bonds but Mr Svojitka said Vereinsbank expected to return to the
market again later this year.
The bank has applied for a licence to set up a German-style mortgage bank in
the Czech Republic and if the application is successful it 'will seek to
issue bonds with at least a five-year maturity'.
Three further Czech koruna issues are expected to come to the market this
summer. Bankers say another foreign institution may make an issue later this
year.
