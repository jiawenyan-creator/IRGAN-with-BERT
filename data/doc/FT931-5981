FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Mutual &amp; Federal climbs 16%
A RISE of 36 per cent in underwriting surplus helped Mutual &amp; Federal, South
Africa's largest short-term insurer, lift net income by 16 per cent to
R77.2m (Dollars 24.9m) in the six months to the end of September, from
R66.6m a year earlier.
The result reflects the continuation of a turnaround in South Africa's
insurance sector which has been under way for more than a year, following a
period when short-term insurers were hit by uncompetitive rates, a number of
natural disasters, and spiralling crime rates.
This improvement is reflected in an increase of about 70 per cent in the
insurance index on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange over the past year.
Gross premiums rose 13 per cent to R645.2m from R573.5m and net premiums
advanced 14 per cent to R548.4m from R482.4m. The underwriting surplus rose
to R34.6m from R25.4m. Mr Ken Saggers, managing director, said the
improvement resulted from stringent expense control and the absence of
natural catastrophes.
He added, however, that the group's commercial and industrial portfolios
remained highly competitive and underrated - to the tune of about 15 per
cent - while high levels of crime-related losses remained a concern.
