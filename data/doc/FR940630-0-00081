 Fishing restrictions; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces a reduction in the cumulative vessel trip limit for the Dover sole, thornyheads, and trawl-caught
sablefish complex (DTS) and reductions in the cumulative vessel trip limits for thornyheads and trawl-caught sablefish
in the groundfish fishery off Washington, Oregon, and California. This action is authorized by the regulations implementing
the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The trip limits are designed to keep landings within
the 1994 harvest guidelines for these species while extending the fishery as long as possible during the year.

<DATE>
DATES:

 Effective from 0001 hours (local time) July, 1, 1994, until December 31, 1994. Comments will be accepted through July
15, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The FMP and its implementing regulations (50 CFR part 663) provide for rapid changes to specific management measures
that have been designated routine. Trip landing and frequency limits for the DTS complex are among those management
measures that have been designated as routine at 50 CFR 663.23(c)(1). Implementation and further adjustment of those
measures may occur after consideration at a single Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) meeting.


A trip limit is defined at 50 CFR 663.2 as:




the total allowable amount of a groundfish species or species complex by weight, or by percentage of weight of fish
on board, that may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed from a single fishing trip.




A cumulative trip limit is the maximum amount that may be taken and retained, possessed or landed per vessel in a specified
period of time, without a limit on the number of landings or trips. Cumulative trip limits for 1994 apply to calendar
months.
On January 1, 1994, the cumulative trip limit for the DTS complex was set at 50,000 lb (22,680 kg) per month, including
no more than 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) of thornyheads and 12,000 lb (5,443 kg) of trawl-caught sablefish. In any landing
of the DTS complex, the trip limit for trawl-caught sablefish was set at 1,000 lb (454 kg) or 25 percent of the DTS complex,
whichever was greater, and applied to each trip. In any landing, no more than 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) could be trawl-caught
sablefish smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) (total length) (59 FR 685, January 6, 1994).
In order to simplify the percentage portion of the trip limit, on May 6, 1994, NMFS restated it in equivalent terms that
are easier to calculate_25 percent of the DTS complex (including sablefish) is equivalent to 33.333 percent (approximately
one third) of the legal thornyheads and Dover sole (i.e., the DTS complex excluding sablefish) (59 FR 23638, May 6,
1994).
DTS are managed collectively as the DTS complex because they are often caught together in the trawl fishery. Information
on DTS complex landings indicated that at the current rate of harvest, the harvest guidelines for thornyheads and
trawl-caught sablefish would be achieved well before the end of the year. The Council, therefore, convened an emergency
tele-conference Council meeting to consider the issue on June 17, 1994. The best available information presented
at the June 17, 1994, teleconference Council meeting indicated that the trawl catch of sablefish through May 28, 1994,
was 1,803 mt or 51 percent of the 1994 trawl allocation, and that the catch rate for trawl-caught sablefish during April-May
1994 was 112 percent of the catch rate average for this period in 1992 and 1993. The data also indicated that the catch
of thornyheads through May 28, 1994, was 3,829 mt or 55 percent of the 1994 harvest guideline for thornyheads. High
thornyhead prices to the fishers have attracted much greater effort, and the recent rate of thornyhead landings was
78 percent above the 19921993 catch rate average.
Consequently, if landing rates are not curtailed, the harvest guideline for trawl-caught sablefish (3,521 mt) would
be taken near August 26, 1994, and the harvest guideline for thornyheads (7,000 mt) would be taken near August 7, 1994.
In order to delay the achievement of the harvest guidelines, the Council recommended imposing an immediate reduction
in the cumulative trip limit for the DTS complex from 50,000 lb (22,680 kg) to 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) per calendar month.
Within this limit, no more than 8,000 lb (3,629 kg) may be thornyheads (down from 30,000 lb (13,608 kg)) and no more than
6,000 lb (2,722 kg) may be trawl-caught sablefish (down from 12,000 lb (5,443 kg)). The individual trip limit for trawl-caught
sablefish of 1,000 lb (454 kg) or 33.333 percent of the legal thornyheads and Dover sole, whichever is greater, and
the 5,000 pound (2,268 kg) limit on trawl-caught sablefish smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) (total length) remain unchanged.
The sharp increase in monthly catch of thornyheads and sablefish has been associated with a decrease in the monthly
catch of Dover sole. The reduction in the thornyhead cumulative limit is expected to greatly reduce the magnitude
and frequency of trips in deep water. The shift in effort to shallow water should increase the catch of Dover sole and
decrease the catch of thornyheads, but sablefish are caught in association with both species. Because the sablefish
limit has been reduced to 6,000 lb (2,721 kg), the reduction in the DTS complex limit from 50,000 lb (22,680 kg) to 30,000
lb (13,608 kg) is designed to prevent increases in sablefish discard as vessels increase targeting on Dover sole.


Secretarial Action


NMFS hereby announces the following change to the management measures announced at 59 FR 685, January 6, 1994, pursuant
to 50 CFR 663.23(c)(1):
(1) Coastwide, no more than 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) cumulative of the DTS complex may be taken and retained, possessed,
or landed per vessel in a calendar month, of which no more than 8,000 lb (3,629 kg) cumulative of thornyheads and 6,000
lb (2,722 kg) cumulative of trawl-caught sablefish may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel in a
calendar month.
(2) In any trip, no more than 1,000 lb (454 kg) or 33.333 percent of the legal thornyheads and Dover sole, whichever is
greater, may be trawl-caught sablefish; and no more than 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) may be trawl-caught sablefish smaller
than 22 inches (56 cm) (total length).
The determination to take this action is based on the most recent data available. The aggregate data upon which the
determination is based are available for public inspection at the Office of the Regional Director, Northwest Region,
(see 

ADDRESSES

) during business hours.


Classification


Delay in the implementation of this action could result in exceeding the trawl-caught sablefish allocation and/or
exceeding the thornyhead limited entry harvest guideline. Furthermore, there was an opportunity for public comment
at the June 17 Council meeting. The Secretary therefore finds good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and 553(d)(3) to
waive the requirements for publication of a general notice of proposed rulemaking and a 30-day delay in effectiveness
for this action.
This action is taken under the authority of 50 CFR 663.23(c) and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866.
