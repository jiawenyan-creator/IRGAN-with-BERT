FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Lee resigns from Aitken Hume
Mr Lee Ming Tee, the chairman of Allied Group, the Hong Kong-based group
raided by the police in September, has resigned as a director of Aitken Hume
International, writes Andrew Jack.
Mr Lee and Mr Brian O'Connor, a fellow director of Aitken Hume, were named
in a report commissioned by the financial secretary of Hong Kong to examine
the affairs of Allied. In March last year Allied held a 30 per cent stake in
Aitken Hume, but Mr Bill Brown, deputy chairman, said yesterday that there
were no business dealings between Allied and Aitken.
