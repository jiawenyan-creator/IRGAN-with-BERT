FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Farepak makes Pounds 8.5m purchase
Farepak yesterday expanded its food hamper business with the Pounds 8.5m
purchase of Littlewoods Hampers from the mail order and retailing group.
Similar to Farepak's core activities, Littlewoods Hampers sells food, drinks
and non-food Christmas items through local agents. Combining the two
businesses will significantly cut costs and improve profits in the 1993-94
year, Farepak said.
The agreement also gives Farepak access to Littlewoods' mail order lists and
databases for 20 years.
Farepak will pay Pounds 4m initially and further payments of Pounds 900,000
are due annually for five years.
Tangible assets acquired have a book value of Pounds 140,000. Pre-tax
profits were Pounds 360,000 on turnover of Pounds 6.2m for the 1992 year.
