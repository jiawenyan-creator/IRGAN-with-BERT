FT  31 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: First-half fall in net
earnings at CRA
CRA, the Australian mining group in which RTZ of the UK holds a 49 per cent
stake, has announced after-tax profits of ADollars 296.6m (USDollars 220m)
for the half-year to June, down from ADollars 360m in the same period of
1993. Total revenues were ADollars 3.43bn against ADollars 2.87bn.
The figures are calculated on a statutory consolidated basis; on an
equity-accounted basis, CRA said after-tax profit would have shown a fall of
ADollars 51.7m to ADollars 327.9m.
Even on the non-equity accounted basis, the comparisons are muddied by
abnormal items. The ADollars 296.6m profit includes a ADollars 160.1m
pre-tax abnormal surplus, representing the profit on the sale of CRA's stake
in Pasminco earlier this year. The result also includes a ADollars 19.4m
charge, stemming from a fall in pension fund surpluses.
CRA said if these factors were excluded, operating profits after tax but
before the pension fund adjustment and the Pasminco gain would have stood at
ADollars 200.2m, a ADollars 70.4m fall from the first half of 1993.
Most of CRA's core divisions saw profits fall in the half year. On an
equity-accounted basis and after tax, iron ore's contribution to earnings
fell to ADollars 146.2m from ADollars 191m, while coal was down to ADollars
55.4m from ADollars 119.5m. Both were hit by the reduced prices agreed with
important Japanese buyers, while the coal business also suffered industrial
disruption.
Gold and copper was down to ADollars 23.2m from ADollars 34.7m and diamonds
to ADollars 27.7m from ADollars 41.4m.
There is a unchanged dividend of 30 cents a share.
