CAMPAIGNS OF FEINSTEIN AND VAN DE KAMP 
Although it is encouraging to see that the candidates for governor are 
concerned about education, I am not optimistic that the ultimate winner will 
retain that commitment. 
After all, George Deukmejian won the seat claiming that he would be a governor 
with education as his top priority. Nothing could be further from the truth! He 
has broken promises to the educational community concerning the implementation 
of Proposition 98. His budget proposals for the upcoming year will be 
devastating to our schools. 
So, I only wonder if the candidates will maintain their commitment towards 
education after election day.
