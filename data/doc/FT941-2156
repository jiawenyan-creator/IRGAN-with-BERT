FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Underwriters threaten to cancel
Israeli issue
The underwriters of the share offering for Shikun U'Pituah, the Israeli
state construction group, have threatened to cancel the issue. The move has
prompted threats of a lawsuit by the treasury, Reuter reports from
Jerusalem.
The sale of Shikun U'Pituah was to have been one of Israel's largest share
offerings. It would also have been the first time that a state-owned company
had been completely privatised on the Tel Aviv stock exchange.
Analysts said underwriters of the offering - scheduled to have gone ahead
today - had shelved the issue because they believed the planned price was
too high to attract buyers in a depressed market.
The finance ministry said: 'The treasury reserves the right to sue for
damages if the underwriters fail to underwrite the offer.'
The flotation was expected to have brought the government a return of about
Dollars 337m.
A number of recent privatisation issues in Israel have had a rough ride,
with buyer interest well below initial projections.
This trend has been intensified by stock market weakness amid a rash of
insider-trading investigations.
