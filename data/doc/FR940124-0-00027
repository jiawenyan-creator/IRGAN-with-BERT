907.1 

Purpose. 



(a) 

Purpose.

 This part implements section 132 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102550, approved
October 28, 1992) (hereafter section 132). Section 132 establishes a demonstration program to facilitate self-sufficiency
and permits the homeownership sale of single family homes administered by the Housing Authority of the City of Omaha
in the State of Nebraska (hereafter ``the Housing Authority''). The purpose of the demonstration is to exhibit the
effectiveness of promoting homeownership and providing support services. 

(b) 

Expiration date.

 This part 907 expires on January 24, 1995. 



907.2Applicability. 



This part applies to single-family public housing units administered by the Housing Authority that have been designated
by the Housing Authority for eventual homeownership. Before entering into a contract or other obligation to sell
a home to a homebuyer under this part, the Housing Authority will give the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(hereafter HUD) a written proposed designation that a home is to be sold under this part. The proposed designation
shall specify the address of the unit(s) to be sold. HUD shall review the proposed designation to ensure that the designated
home is single family public housing, that the Housing Authority has not designated more than twenty percent of the
total number of public housing units that it administers and that the location of the homes complies with fair housing
requirements. (The twenty percent ceiling on the number of homes that can be designated is 602 homes plus twenty percent
of any additional public housing units developed by the Housing Authority through the award of public housing development
funds pursuant to section 5 of the 1937 Act subsequent to October 28, 1992 that do not constitute replacement units
for units demolished or disposed of pursuant to Section 18 of the 1937 Act or the Section 5(H) or Title III homeownership
programs under the 1937 Act.) Consistent with the Housing Authority's affirmative obligation to further fair housing
objectives, the Housing Authority shall offer homeownership opportunities in a variety of locations and promote
an expanded housing choice for minorities. Homeownership opportunities for minorities shall include locations
not located in an area of minority concentration. 



907.3 

General authority for sale. 



The Housing Authority may sell single family homes designated pursuant to 907.2, for purposes of homeownership,
according to a homeownership plan approved by HUD under this part. If the home is subject to indebtedness under the
ACC, HUD will continue to make any debt service contributions for which it is obligated under the ACC, and the property
sold will not be subject to the encumbrance of that indebtedness. (In the case of a home that is part of a development
with financing restrictions (such as a bond-financed development), however, sale is subject to the terms and conditions
of the applicable restrictions.) In reference to housing properties, ``development'' means the same as ``project,''
as defined in the United States Housing Act of 1937 (hereafter the 1937 Act), rather than the statutory definition
of ``development.'' Upon sale in accordance with the HUD-approved homeownership plan, HUD will execute a release
of the title restrictions prescribed by the ACC. Because the property will no longer be subject to the ACC after sale,
it will cease to be eligible for further HUD funding for operating subsidies or modernization under the 1937 Act upon
conveyance of title by the PHA. (That does not preclude any other types of post-sale subsidies that may be available,
under other Federal, State, or local programs, such as the possibility of available assistance under Section 8 of
the 1937 Act, in connection with a plan for cooperative homeownership.) 



907.4 

Fundamental criteria for HUD approval. 




HUD will approve the Housing Authority's homeownership plan if it meets all three of the following criteria: 

(a) The plan must be practically workable, with sound potential for long-term success. Financial viability, including
the capability of purchasers to meet the financial obligations of homeownership, is a critical requirement. 

(b) The plan must be consistent with law, including the requirements of this part, any other applicable Federal, State,
and local statutes and regulations, and existing contracts. Subject to the other two criteria stated in this section,
any provision that is not contrary to those legal requirements may be included in the plan, at the discretion of the
Housing Authority, whether or not expressly authorized in this part.
