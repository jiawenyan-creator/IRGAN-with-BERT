<F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source in the Defense </F>
Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Yemen; date not given] 
  [Text] At a time when the media of the ruling military 
regime in Sanaa and its foreign minister, Muhammad Salim 
Basindwah, are putting out statements to the effect that this 
regime is observing the cease-fire, the forces of this 
treacherous and adventurist regime mounted an aggressive attack 
at 0300 today. 
  Our heroic Armed Forces of the (?inner) Hadramawt axis 
repulsed this new act of aggression with rare courage, 
inflicting crushing blows on the enemy forces and causing them 
heavy losses in life and materiel. Our forces captured eight 
enemy [word indistinct] vehicles. At 1100 today our air 
defenses shot down one enemy MiG-21 fighter aircraft beyond the 
(al-Asalin) Heights. At 1530 today the enemy was forced to 
retreat. Our forces are currently in pursuit and mopping up 
remaining pockets of the enemy. God is great.
