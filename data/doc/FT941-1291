FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hutchison Whampoa net surges
107% to HKDollars 6bn
Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing,
yesterday marked an end to its troubled start to the decade with the
announcement of a 107 per cent surge in net profits, to HKDollars 6.3bn
(USDollars 546.4m) for 1993, up from HKDollars 3.05bn the previous year.
The profits were achieved against a HKDollars 1.4bn provisions bill related
to the write-off of the loss-making Rabbit CT2 telepoint business in the UK.
This was offset by the Dollars 1.6bn profit made on the sale to News
Corporation of its stake in Hutchvision, the programme supplier to Star TV.
Both items were taken above the line.
Taken on a per-share basis, earnings were up 86 per cent to HKDollars 1.79,
against 96 cents in 1992. Turnover improved a more modest 18 per cent to
HKDollars 24.7bn.
Earnings, which were broadly in line with market forecasts, were driven by
increased rental income as the group built up its portfolio of investment
properties in the colony's buoyant market. The group's container terminal
investments, and a positive contribution from the 49 per cent-owned Husky
Oil, also helped lift profits.
Mr Li, chairman, said the group's land holdings in Hong Kong were being
depleted through re-development. Progress was being made in the search for
suitable property development projects in China. Joint ventures in a range
of infrastructure and retail projects, including power plants, had already
been established.
Hongkong International Terminals (HIT), the group's container terminal
operator, handled a record through-put of 3.49m TEUs (20ft equivalent
units). During the latter part of the year, Hutchison lifted its
shareholding in HIT by 17 per cent to 77.5 per cent.
Mr Alex Ho, head of research at Jardine Fleming, reckoned property
development contributed around HKDollars 1.8bn to net profits, with more
than a further HKDollars 1bn coming from the container terminal operations.
Directors are recommending a final dividend of 49 cents which, together with
the interim of 19 cents, represents a 24 per cent increase onthe 1992
payment of 55 cents.
