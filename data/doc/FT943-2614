FT  19 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hungary plans drugs group sale
The Hungarian government is preparing to sell about 36 per cent of Richter
Gedeon, the country's largest pharmaceuticals company, in which it has a
stake of 87 per cent. It is expected to be one of the country's biggest
privatisation deals this year.
In the first phase, the company will increase its capital by Ft4.4bn
(Dollars 41m) to Ft17.6bn. Part of the issue will be sold via a private
placement to international institutional investors by the end of this month,
according to Creditanstalt Securities which, together with Schroder, the UK
merchant bank, is advising on the privatisation. The balance will be sold
through a domestic public offering scheduled for October, Creditanstalt
said.
The company plans to seek listings on the Budapest and Vienna stock
exchanges and possibly the London over-the-counter market. If floated, the
company will be the largest on the Budapest exchange.
According to government figures, Richter Gedeon was one of Hungary's top
five exporters in the first half of 1994. Under current regulations, the
state holding company, AV Rt, must retain 50 per cent of the company plus
one vote but Creditanstalt said the state was considering changing the rule
to 25 per cent plus one vote.
Richter Gedeon, which was founded in 1901 and nationalised in 1948, had
turnover of Ft11.2bn in the first half of 1994 with gross profit of more
than Ft2bn. Exports accounted for USDollars 67.3m of sales.
Foreign interest in the sale is expected to be strong. The pharmaceuticals
sector is considered one of Hungary's most promising, and Chinoin and Egis,
Hungary's second and third pharmaceutical companies, have already been
privatised.
Chinoin is majority owned by Elf Sanofi, the French company, while the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development took a 30 per cent stake in
Egis last year.
