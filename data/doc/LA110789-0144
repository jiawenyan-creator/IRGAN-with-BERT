LOCAL; 
BIG ROCK HOMEOWNERS FACING DRAINAGE FEE OF $100,000 EACH 
The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously today to assess homeowners in 
Malibu's Big Rock Mesa area more than $100,000 each for a drainage system to 
stabilize their landslide-plagued community. 
"The $500 (monthly assessment over 20 years) is going to put some people out of 
their homes," John Murdock, an attorney for the homeowners, told the 
supervisors. 
The homeowners contend that the proposed $13.8-million drainage system is too 
expensive for them to bear alone and does not guarantee against another 
disaster on the order of a 1983 slide that damaged or destroyed 250 homes. 
The slide led to 4 1/2 years of litigation, which ended in January when the 
county, California Department of Transportation, dozens of insurance companies 
and attorneys for about 240 Big Rock homeowners reached a settlement that will 
pay the homeowners $97 million -- or about $200,000 each after legal fees -- 
for the damage. 
Many of the residents, as well as some who were not part of the lawsuit and 
others who bought homes in the area after the litigation began, were stunned by 
the county's plans to triple their property taxes to help pay for stabilizing 
the slide-prone area.
