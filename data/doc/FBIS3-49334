  [Text] Jan Lisuch, state secretary in the Slovak Foreign 
Ministry, handed a memorandum about the coming NATO summit to 
the representatives of embassies from NATO member states, and of 
the Visegrad Four countries based in Bratislava. Ivan Mjartan, 
the Slovak ambassador in the Czech Republic, handed the same 
text simultaneously to the ambassadors of NATO member states 
based in Prague. 
  The memorandum states, among other things, that our Republic 
holds in high esteem the NATO project, also known as Partnership 
for Peace, initialled by the U.S. Government, and is prepared to 
join it and take an active part in projects and missions 
organized within its framework. This project will undoubtedly 
contribute to markedly intensified cooperation between Slovakia 
and NATO and its member states in political and military issues.
