FT  07 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pension failing was inability to show
what member would receive
Sir, Mr M A Bentley (Letters, November 2) seems to have an interestingly
topsy-turvy view about company pension schemes. It is true that one of the
merits of a money-purchase scheme is that it clearly shows each member's
'savings'. Equally, its greatest failing is its inability to show what a
member can expect to receive at retirement. It was this shortcoming which
was put to such good use by some personal pensions salesmen who were able to
hoodwink huge numbers of employees with wildly unreasonable predictions. If
personal pensions had been required to show a proper estimate of what a
member was likely to receive at retirement then I would agree that, in Mr
Bentley's own words, 'most employees would never have spared a moment to
consider personal pension plans'.
To try to drag employers and occupational pension schemes into this
depressing, but predictable, saga with mis-sold personal pensions is quite
unfair. Many employers, and their associations, made strong criticisms about
personal pensions at the time they were introduced. These criticisms were
cheerfully dismissed as being nothing more than vested interest. Had the
proponents of personal pensions been recognised at the time for the vested
interests that they really were, the position of many disappointed personal
pension policy holders would now be quite different.
