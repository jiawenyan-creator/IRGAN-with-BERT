  [Excerpts] The decision made by the United States to 
continue the ban on travel to Lebanon for another six months is 
considered an initial success for Lebanon. A final lifting of 
the ban is expected in the coming stage. [passage omitted] 
  Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz has said that there is no 
justification for the decision to extend the ban either on 
security or political grounds, even though the decision contains 
some positive indications. 
  The U.S. decision to extend the ban on travel to Lebanon for 
only six months is expected to be the subject of consultations 
among President Ilyas al-Hirawi, Chamber of Deputies Speaker 
Nabih Birri, and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri.
