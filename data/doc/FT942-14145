FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: TR European Pounds 60m conversion share
issue
TR European Growth Trust, a specialist smaller companies investment trust,
is hoping to raise up to Pounds 60m with a conversion share issue.
There have been indications of interest for Pounds 25m of the new shares
during the placing stage.
This could be increased to Pounds 45m, leaving at least Pounds 15m to be
available through a public offer for subscription.
The trust had net assets of Pounds 64.5m at the end of March.
Several recent investment trust share issues have fallen far short of their
initial targets due to difficult market conditions.
However, TR European's shares are trading at a slight premium, which shows
that demand is relatively strong.
The public offer closes on May 13, and conversion should take place by the
end of August.
