  [Excerpts] Today, at the beginning of the Supreme Soviet 
session, secret voting for candidates to the Constitutional 
Court was held. The candidacies were put forward at the evening 
plenary session yesterday. Ten were listed. After the speeches 
in the traditional miscellaneous section on the agenda, people's 
deputies conducted the secret voting, electing the following 
members of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Belarus: 
Vasilevich, Padhrusha, Pastukhow, Serada, Fadzeyew, Filipchyk, 
Khoma, Tsikhinya, and Tsishkevich. Immediately, in the session 
hall, the newly elected judges were sworn in. [passage omitted 
including the act of swearing and speaker's congratulations] 
  We, the journalists, add our congratulations to all those 
voiced in the session hall. I congratulate Valeryy Ryhoryevich 
Tsikhinya: Valeryy Ryhoryevich, please accept my warmest 
congratulations on your election to the Constitutional Court. 
  [Begin recording] [Tsikhinya in Russian] Thank you for your 
congratulations. I feel that the Supreme Soviet has done me a 
great honor today. I will try to justify the Supreme Soviet's 
trust. 
  [Rudkowski] With what will the Constitutional Court begin 
its work? 
  [Tsikhinya] First of all, we have to implement the adopted 
law on the Constitutional Court by working out a statute of the 
Constitutional Court. We have no right to begin our work 
without this statute. Therefore, a month after electing the 
Constitutional Court -- and it was elected today in its 
competent body -- we have to work out and adopt the statute of 
Constitutional Court proceedings as well as to resolve all other 
questions stemming from the law on the Constitutional Court. 
  [Rudkowski] As is known, the chairman of the Constitutional 
Court will be elected by our president [pauses]. 
  [Tsikhinya] I cannot fully agree with you. Why? Because 
the chairman of the Constitutional Court is elected not by the 
president, but by the Supreme Soviet at the president's 
recommendation. That is, the president may propose a chairman 
from this body of judges, or propose a new candidate for the 
Supreme Soviet to elect him or her as head of the Constitutional 
Court. 
  [Rudkowski] We know what the fate was of Russia's 
Constitutional Court. There were very difficult political 
moments there. Can the same situation take place in Belarus? 
  [Tsikhinya] Prognosticating is a very hard task. 
Nonetheless, I will say that we are not going to play politics, 
because political issues should be resolved by political means, 
while juridical ones should be resolved with the help of the 
law. Therefore, beginning today, I suspend my membership in the 
Party of Communists of Belarus and do not intend to join any 
social organizations which pursue political goals. This is 
demanded by the law on the Constitutional Court. My only 
superior will be the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus in 
force in 1994. 
  [Rudkowski] God bless you. I wish you every success. 
  [Tsikhinya] Thank you. [end recording] 
  This way the extraordinary -- 14th -- Supreme Soviet session 
closed its work.
