FT  23 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: London copper prices rise
sharply on technical factors
COPPER PRICES rose sharply yesterday as technical influences gripped markets
where trading was thin because of the approaching holiday.
Traders said there was some Chinese buying and news that Polish copper
miners might join a general strike, but these had little influence - neither
did renewed unrest in Zaire, once a big copper producer.
The upward surge was mainly caused by options-related activity, currency
movements and by chart-watching buyers, they suggested.
Copper for delivery in three months reached Dollars 2,277 a tonne (Dollars
1.03 a lb) at one stage on the London Metal Exchange yesterday and it was
still Dollars 2,274 in after-hours business, up Dollars 17 a tonne from
Monday.
In sterling terms, the price was also helped by the pound's weakness against
the dollar. Three-month copper closed at Pounds 1,489.25 a tonne, up Pounds
35.75.
Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group,
pointed to the profound effect commodity funds, managing about Dollars 26bn,
were having on traded metals markets.
'These funds tend to work primarily on technical analysis,' he said.
