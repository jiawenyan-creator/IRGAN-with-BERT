MORNING REPORT: STAGE 
Public Invests in "Bernadette': A musical about Bernadette of Lourdes, the 
French girl who saw a vision of the Virgin Mary in 1858, opened in London's 
West End Thursday, financed in part by investments from the public. Producer 
William Fonfe says he appealed to the public after wealthy investors refused to 
back "Bernadette" upon learning it was written and produced by unknowns. He 
said his production company had received about $1 million from the public, and 
he raised the rest for the $2-million production himself by re-mortgaging his 
home, among other measures. GREG BRAXTON
