  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires -- Defense Minister Oscar Camilion 
stressed on 23 May that it was "only the usual and simple 
disagreements that often happen in governments" that occurred 
during the cabinet meeting held on 20 May in the city of La 
Rioja. 
  At the end of a ceremony commemorating the creation of the 
Grenadiers Regiment that took place this morning in San Martin 
Plaza, the minister avoided making any more comments on the 20 
May meeting, although he did say: "No threats regarding 
resignations were made by the ministers," referring to Economy 
Minister Domingo Cavallo. 
  Regarding the Security Secretariat's creation, the defense 
minister said: "It is an initiative that merits study, but 
taking into account current legal norms that currently are in 
force." [passage omitted]
