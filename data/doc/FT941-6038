FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: ABC to take Unique Broadcasting stake
ABC of the US has reached agreement in principle to take a significant
minority stake in Unique Broadcasting, the independent producer that makes
radio programmes for commercial radio stations in the UK and the BBC.
Unique, in which Capital Radio, the London commercial broadcaster, has a 24
per cent stake, produces programmes such as the Pepsi Network Chart Show for
commercial radio, Rock Line for BBC Radio 1 and interval talks for Radio 3.
ABC, which is interested in increasing its presence in the independent
sector, is likely to take a stake of about 20 per cent in Unique, although
this could rise later.
ABC already owns a 33 per cent stake in Satellite Media Services in the UK.
In the US the company has been developing streams of radio services
delivered by satellite to local stations all over America. This helps local
stations cut costs.
It is likely that ABC may be planning something similar in partnership with
Unique, which was founded by Mr Simon Cole and Mr Tim Blackmore, who hold
about 25 per cent each.
It is believed that, as part of the strategy, ABC is in talks with the
Financial Times about the possibility of creating an FT radio service for
distribution to UK commercial radio stations.
