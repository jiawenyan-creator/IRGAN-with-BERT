BRIEFLY 
Supreme Court Will Review Texas Thrift Ruling: In a case affecting the 
government's efforts to deal with the S&amp;L crisis, the court agreed to 
decide whether federal regulators can be held liable for supervisory acts in 
running a troubled thrift. The court said it would hear a Justice Department 
appeal seeking to dismiss a lawsuit by Thomas Gaubert, former chairman of 
Independent American Savings Assn., a Texas thrift that was closed in 1987. He 
charged in the suit that the thrift's failure was caused by the negligence of 
regulators.
