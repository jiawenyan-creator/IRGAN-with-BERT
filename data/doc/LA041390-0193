TV'S 'WORKING GIRL' UNRUFFLED BY PART 
Sandra Bullock could be taking a risk by starring in the television series 
"Working Girl," which premieres Monday night on NBC. After all, Melanie 
Griffith received an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Tess McGill in the 
hit film of the same name. But Bullock seems as philosophical as any working 
girl about the possible pitfalls. 
"Oh yeah, I knew as soon as I started in on this that I'd probably get some 
criticism because of people being judgmental about the movie," Bullock said in 
a telephone interview from Los Angeles. "People are going to have their 
opinions. But within half of the first show, they'll see it's an ensemble piece 
and they'll lighten up on me." 
Bullock has finished 13 episodes of "Working Girl," and she says she has gained 
a great deal of confidence as she has become comfortable in the role, sort of 
the way Tess McGill managed to go from secretary to junior executive. 
"I'm pretty sure (Melanie) had a lot of herself in the part. She's got one of 
those really soft demeanors," Bullock said of the inevitable comparison. "I'm a 
little harder on the outside." 
Bullock got the role on short notice. The producers had looked at a lot of 
actresses when she got a call from her agent. Bullock happened to be in Los 
Angeles visiting her boyfriend and was about to return to her home in New York 
City. 
"I got the part on a Thursday and we started shooting on a Monday," Bullock 
recalled. "I was one of the thousands of people they saw. I'm sure they were 
looking for a name. I was very lucky. It was all so fast." 
Bullock went into "Working Girl" with a short but recognized list of credits. 
She had favorable reviews for her work in an off-Broadway play, "No Time Flat," 
and later had roles in the television movies, "The Preppie Murder" and "The 
Bionic Showdown." She also will appear in two films set for release later this 
year, "Who Shot Pat?" and "Religion, Inc."
