FT  13 MAY 93 / Heseltine summons industry 'round table': Why the 'knights'
of business are to gather
REPORTS OF the demise of the National Economic Development Council, the
tripartite economic policy forum terminated by the government last year, may
have been exaggerated.
A slimmed-down, 1990s version of the council is being launched - with
neither public fanfare nor the involvement of trade unions - later this
month by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary.
Mr Heseltine has asked 19 top industrialists to a meeting on May 25 to talk
about the economy and the long-term framework for industry. The 'round
table' is expected to meet once or twice a year, backed up by a committee of
representatives from the same companies who will feed Mr Heseltine's
officials with economic data.
Few outside a small circle of officials and business people know about the
gathering, and the guest list has not been broadcast. The DTI says the
meeting will be a private exchange of views, part of the effort by Mr
Heseltine to seek a partnership with business.
Although no one at the DTI is claiming this, many will see the initiative as
part of an attempt by Mr Heseltine to reduce the Treasury's dominance in
economic policymaking. While the Treasury says it welcomes Mr Heseltine's
group, its existence may be construed as threatening the already fragile
power base of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
Many of those invited to the meeting are guarded about what to expect. Mr
Christopher Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, said: 'I welcome the
initiative but am still unclear about what it is all about. The government
is doing some useful things to help industry but I worry that it lacks
intellectual drive and seems to be surviving day-to-day.'
Mr Ken Coates, chairman of engineering group Meggitt, said: 'No one expects
the government to do much more than create economic stability and make sure
there is a level playing field between the UK and overseas. But if the
government keeps buggering about as in the last 18 months (over economic
policy and the exit from the European exchange rate mechanism) then life
becomes difficult.'
The analogy between Mr Heseltine's 'round table' and the NEDC is underlined
by the involvement in the new scheme of Mr Walter Eltis, the last director
of the National Economic Development Office who is now Mr Heseltine's
economic adviser. The NEDO, also wound up last year, acted as the
secretariat for the NEDC.
Like the council, Mr Heseltine's gathering is intended to bring together
representatives from the top tier of UK industry. Invited are the chairmen
or top executives of 19 large companies, including Marks and Spencer, Racal
Electronics, Rover, Grand Metropolitan, the Post Office, J. Sainsbury,
National Westminster Bank, International Computers, Mercury Communications
and Barclays Bank.
The Treasury is sending a representative in the shape of Mr Robin
Mountfield, who is in charge of its industry division.
The aims of Mr Heseltine's group are obscure. The DTI is keeping quiet about
any detailed agenda. They will, however, be far less ambitious than those of
the NEDC, which examined different parts of industry in detail.
Mr Heseltine's round table - the 19 'knights' - will spend part of the time
discussing the short-term outlook as Britain struggles to emerge from
recession. This discussion is expected to give Mr Heseltine useful views on
economic fluctuations to supplement data from the Treasury and other
sources.
The first meeting will discuss a report drawn up from a parallel group of
representatives from the same 19 companies - the 'scouts' - which met for
the first time last month and will focus on the economy.
The scouts, mainly at the level of finance director or senior economist, are
likely to meet every four months. At their first gathering they discussed
the signs of fragile upturn, drawing on indicators from their companies to
either support or depress hopes that recovery will be sustained.
A strong conclusion from last month's meeting was the risk that recovery
could be blown off-course by the serious slowdown in continental Europe. The
scouts also agreed to send to Mr Eltis, as often as every month,
confidential sales data which might give extra clues about the nature of the
recovery.
The knights are also expected to discuss longer-term questions about how the
government can best lay the ground for industrial prosperity. This fits in
with Mr Heseltine's plans to change Whitehall's culture to fit in with
business thinking. He sees himself as a 'friend in court' to industry
leaders, providing a helping hand rather than producing grandiose plans
involving dollops of state intervention.
One item on the agenda later this month may be the report drawn up by Mr
Heseltine's officials detailing how much of UK industry is lagging in
management and technology behind industrial rivals. The trade and industry
secretary is concerned that Britain, in spite of some progress in the 1980s,
lies 18th in the 24-nation OECD league of competitiveness.

HESELTINE'S KNIGHTS FORECAST THE FUTURE OF CO-OPERATION

  We need change because much of industry is not winning.'
 -Sir Christopher Lewinton, chairman of the TI engineering group
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'If the government keeps buggering about as it has done in the last 18
  months then life becomes difficult.'
 -Mr Ken Coates, chairman of engineering group Meggitt
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
' I applaud anything that improves discussion between industry and the
  government; we've been a bit short of it over the past 10 years.'
 -Lord Weir, chairman of the Weir engineering group

'Industry has got used to having nothing to do with government. We're
  wondering where the new dialogue is leading.'
 -Mr Martin Taylor, chairman and chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
'In our business we are close to lots of barometers which measure how
  the economy is performing. It makes sense for the government to want
