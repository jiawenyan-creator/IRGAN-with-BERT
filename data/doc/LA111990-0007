INCOME TAX CHOICES 
Robert Deville's suggestion (letter, Nov. 11) that the National Endowment for 
the Arts be funded by a "checkoff box" on the federal income tax form is such a 
good idea that I would like to expand on it. Why not have checkoff boxes for 
all the major categories in the national budget? We could have boxes for the 
Defense Department, the National Park Service, federal aid to education, 
Medicare, federal law enforcement agencies, and so on. 
That way, each taxpayer could be assured that his taxes went to government 
functions he approved of. 
Furthermore, the checkoff would also serve as a national referendum on the 
budget. If money were spent only on those things the people are willing to be 
taxed for, the budget would be automatically balanced, and the unseemly budget 
battles between Congress and the White House would be eliminated.
