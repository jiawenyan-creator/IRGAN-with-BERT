FT  04 JUN 92 / Belling to cut 1,000 jobs
MORE THAN 1,000 employees of Belling, the electric cooker manufacturer which
went into receivership last week after 82 years in business, are to lose
their jobs.
The receivers appointed to manage Belling, which has been incurring losses
for three years and has debts of around Pounds 25m, said 850 jobs will go at
the company's factory at Enfield in London. A further 260 jobs will be lost
at its factory in Burnley, Lancashire.
The news was greeted with dismay by union representatives. Mr Roger Butler,
of the London executive of the AEEU engineering and electrical union, said:
'Our worst fears have been confirmed. We are particularly annoyed that there
has been no consultation with the unions over these redundancies.'
Mr Patrick McKeown, convener at the Enfield factory, said it was 'shattering
news' for workers who would find it very difficult to get new jobs.
Mr Paul Jeffery, one of the joint receivers appointed from KPMG Peat
Marwick, said the redundancies had been decided after careful consideration
of the company's position.
He said that costs had to be maintained while a buyer for the business was
sought. As a result, it had been neces-sary to halt production at Enfield.
He emphasised that the long-term intention was to sell the business as a
going concern, and held out the prospect that some of the dismissed
workforce could then be re-employed.
About 150 employees will be retained at Enfield to provide a service
operation for customers. At Burnley, where components are manufactured, 40
people will remain on the payroll.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said the decision illustrated
'the disastrous effect of the recession that is still biting hard into the
British economy'.
He added: 'It is clear the optimism of government ministers has been utterly
misplaced. We now look forward to a summer of mounting job losses and
closures.'
