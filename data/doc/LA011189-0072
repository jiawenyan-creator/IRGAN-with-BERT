The Supreme Court, on a 6-3 vote, said that a defendant testifying in his own 
behalf has no right to consult with his lawyer during a brief recess. In 1976, 
the justices said a defendant must be allowed to talk to his lawyer during an 
overnight recess, but the majority refused to extend the ruling. Justice John 
Paul Stevens noted that the defendant in this case was about to be 
cross-examined. "It is entirely appropriate for the trial judge to decide . . . 
that cross-examination is more likely to elicit truthful responses" if the 
witness was not allowed to consult with third parties, Stevens wrote in the 
case (Perry vs. Leeke, 87-6325). The ruling upholds a life sentence given to a 
South Carolina man convicted of murder, kidnaping and assault.
