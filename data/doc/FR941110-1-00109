 

(I) The amount of unexpended allowances or 
authorizations of the type and for the control period being 
converted that the convertor holds under authority of this 
subpart as of the date the claim is submitted to EPA. 
(ii) The Administrator will determine whether the records 
maintained by EPA, taking into account any previous conversions, 
any transfers, and any production, imports (not including 
transshipments, or used controlled substances), or exports (not 
including transshipments, or used controlled substances) of 
controlled substances reported by the convertor, indicate that 
the convertor possesses, as of the date the conversion claim is 
processed, unexpended allowances sufficient to cover the 
conversion claim (i.e., the amount to be converted plus, in the 
case of conversions of production or consumption allowances, one 
percent of that amount). Within three working days of receiving a 
complete conversion claim, the Administrator will take action to 
notify the convertor as follows: 
(A) If EPA's records show that the convertor has 
sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the conversion claim 
the Administrator will issue a notice indicating that EPA does 
not object to the conversion and will reduce the convertor's 
balance of unexpended allowances by the amount to be converted 
plus, in the case of conversions of production or consumption 
allowances, one percent of that amount. When EPA issues a no 
objection notice, the convertor may proceed with the conversion. 
However, if EPA ultimately finds that the convertor did not have 
sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the claim, the 
convertor will be held liable for any violations of the 
regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in 
conjunction with, the improper conversion. 

(B) If EPA's records show that the convertor has 
insufficient unexpended allowances to cover the conversion claim, 
or that the convertor has failed to respond to one or more Agency 
requests to supply information needed to make a determination, 
the Administrator will issue a notice disallowing the conversion. 
Within 10 working days after receipt of notification, the 
convertor may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons, 
with the Administrator. The Administrator may affirm or vacate 
the disallowance. If no appeal is taken by the tenth working day 
after notification, the disallowance shall be final on that day. 

(iii) In the event that the Administrator does not respond to 
a conversion claim within the three working days specified in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the convertor may proceed with 
the conversion. EPA will reduce the convertor's balance of 
unexpended allowances by the amount to be converted plus, in the 
case of conversions of production or consumption allowances, one 
percent of that amount. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the 
convertor did not have sufficient unexpended allowances to cover 
the claims, the convertor will be held liable for any violations 
of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or 
in conjunction with, the improper conversion. 
(2) Effective January 1, 1995, any person (``convertor'') may 
convert Article 5 allowances for one class I controlled substance 
to the same type of allowance for another class I controlled 
substance within the same Group of controlled substances as the 
first, as follows: 
(i) The convertor must submit to the Administrator a 
conversion claim setting forth the following: 
(A) The identity and address of the convertor; 
(B) The name and telephone number of a contact person for the 
convertor; 
(C) The type of Article 5 allowances being converted, 
including the names of the controlled substances for which 
allowances are to be converted; 
(D) The group of controlled substances to which the Article 5 
allowances being converted pertains; 
(E) The amount and type of allowances to be converted; 
(F) The amount of allowances to be subtracted from the 
convertor's unexpended allowances for the first controlled 
substance, to be equal to 101 percent of the amount of allowances 
converted. 
(G) The amount of Article 5 allowances to be added to the 
convertor's unexpended allowances for the second controlled 
substance, to be equal to the amount of allowances for the first 
controlled substance being converted multiplied by the quotient 
of the ozone depletion factor of the first controlled substance 
divided by the ozone depletion factor of the second controlled 
substance, as listed in Appendix A to this subpart. 
(H) The control period(s) for which the Article 5 allowances 
are being converted; and 
(I) The amount of unexpended Article 5 allowances for the 
control period being converted that the convertor holds under 
authority of this subpart as of the date the claim is submitted 
to EPA. 
(ii) The Administrator will determine whether the records 
maintained by EPA, taking into account any previous conversions, 
any transfers, and any production, or exports of controlled 
substances reported by the convertor, indicate that the convertor 
possesses, as of the date the conversion claim is processed, 
unexpended Article 5 allowances sufficient to cover the 
conversion claim. Within three working days of receiving a 
complete conversion claim, the Administrator will take action to 
notify the convertor as follows: 
(A) If EPA's records show that the convertor has sufficient 
unexpended Article 5 allowances to cover the conversion claim the 
Administrator will issue a notice indicating that EPA does not 
object to the conversion and will reduce the convertor's balance 
of unexpended allowances by the amount to be converted. When EPA 
issues a no objection notice, the convertor may proceed with the 
conversion. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the convertor 
did not have sufficient unexpended Article 5 allowances to cover 
the claim, the convertor will be held liable for any violations 
of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or 
in conjunction with, the improper conversion.
