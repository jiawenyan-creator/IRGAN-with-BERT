FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: US oil groups hit by low prices
EXXON, the largest US oil company, and Texaco yesterday reported sharply
lower first-quarter profits, continuing an industry trend reflecting lower
crude oil prices.
Exxon reported net income of Dollars 1.35bn, or Dollars 1.07 a share, down
from Dollars 2.24bn, or Dollars 1.78, in the same period of 1991.
However, Mr Lawrence Rawl, Exxon's chairman, noted that net income had been
up more than 20 per cent from the Dollars 1.12bn recorded in the 'more
typical' fourth quarter, in spite of lower crude realisations, a weak US
market for natural gas and softer economic conditions in many markets.
He said the results had benefited from stronger natural gas sales in Europe,
improved earnings from worldwide chemicals operations, overseas tax credits
and asset sales.
Operating volumes were strong, with liquids production, natural gas
production, refinery runs, petroleum product sales and chemical sales all
higher than in the first quarter of last year.
US exploration and production made Dollars 125m, down from Dollars 150m,
while foreign production earned Dollars 785m, up from Dollars 721m. Refining
and marketing profits slumped from Dollars 256m to Dollars 23m in the US,
and from Dollars 1.097bn to Dollars 450m abroad. Chemicals saw profits dip
from Dollars 123m to Dollars 87m in the US and from Dollars 100m to Dollars
63m abroad.
Texaco reported net income of Dollars 200m, or 68 cents, compared to Dollars
415m, or Dollars 1.51, in the first period of 1991. Revenues dipped from
Dollars 10.2bn to Dollars 8.6bn due to lower prices, offset only slightly by
higher sales volumes for refined products.
Mr James Kinnear, Texaco's chief executive, said world economic weakness had
lessened demand for crude oil and petroleum products, with a 15 per cent
drop in crude prices since the first quarter of last year.
He said Texaco intended to maintain its strong financial position and was
reducing its planned capital expenditure for the year by 10 per cent.
Meanwhile, Occidental Petroleum, the Los Angeles based group undergoing a
broad restructuring, reported net income of Dollars 98m, or 32 cents a
share, down from Dollars 136m, or 45 cents, in the first quarter of last
year.
