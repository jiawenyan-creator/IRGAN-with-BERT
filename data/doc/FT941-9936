FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: MacMillan Bloedel back in black
Strong lumber prices and an improved market for building materials helped
MacMillan Bloedel, the Canadian west-coast forest products group, return to
profitability last year. Net earnings were CDollars 53.2m (USDollars 39.7m),
or 42 cents a share, compared with the 1992 loss of CDollars 48.8m, or 52
cents. Revenues rose 24 per cent to CDollars 3.76bn.
The sale of a stake in a UK corrugated paper business contributed CDollars
39m to last year's earnings.
Fourth-quarter income was CDollars 5.1m, or 3 cents a share, against a
CDollars 16.5m loss, or 17 cents, a year earlier.
Macblo said yesterday it would invest CDollars 200m in the first lightweight
coated-paper machine in western North America. The machine, at Port Alberni
on Vancouver Island, will produce 160,000 tonnes of paper a year for
magazines and other publications requiring high-quality colour.
Earnings were also boosted by the lower Canadian dollar but the improvement
was contained by lower pulp and containerboard prices.
