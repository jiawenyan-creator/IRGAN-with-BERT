 

Regulatory Flexibility Determination



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately
burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have ``a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' The types of small entities that would be potentially affected
by the implementation of the proposed rule are air taxi operators and pilot schools.

Neither air taxi operators nor pilot schools would be impacted by this planned expansion. This assessment is based
on the fact that this expansion would capture some of the airspace that was previously included in the Mather AFB Class
C airspace area. Current users of this airspace would be able to continue to do so in the same manner as before. Thus,
there would be no incremental cost impact on these operators as a result of this proposed rule.



International Trade Impact Assessment



This proposed rule would not have an effect on the sale of foreign aviation products or services in the United States,
nor would it have an effect on the sale of U.S. products or services in foreign countries because the proposed rule would
neither impose costs on aircraft operators nor aircraft manufacturers (U.S. or foreign).
