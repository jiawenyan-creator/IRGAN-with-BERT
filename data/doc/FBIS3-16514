  [Text] Tallinn, March 16 -- Good relations with Russia 
cannot in any way have unfavourable influence on Finland's 
relations with Estonia, Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho told a 
press conference ending his two-day visit to Estonia, on 
Wednesday [16 March], stressing that there existed no political 
problems between Estonia and Finland. 
  Aho stated that although Russian troop withdrawal from 
Estonia was primarily the matter of these two states it also 
concerned all other states of the region. 
  During his stay, Aho visited besides Tallinn also Tartu and 
Narva. Aho said that Finnish companies would participate at 
solving the environment problems of the Narva Power Plant, for 
these problems cause problems for all Baltic Sea states. He 
said also that after meeting the leaders of the Russian-speaking 
border-town Narva, he got an impression that there have not been 
any acute national problems in the region lately.
