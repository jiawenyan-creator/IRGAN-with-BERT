FT  24 OCT 94 / Company News (This Week): Pushed to meet dealers' high
expectations - Wolseley
Wolseley, the world's biggest distributor of heating and plumbing products,
is expected to report yet another year of record profits tomorrow.
Forecasts range between Pounds 185m and more than Pounds 200m for the year
to the end of July. The company has a history of exceeding City expectations
after talking itself down. Last year it came in with Pounds 121.1m when
analysts had pencilled in between Pounds 110m and Pounds 115m.
But this year analysts expect the results to be more in line with
expectations, which could tell against it. The results might be good,
suggested one, but the shares could still slip precisely because they do not
top the forecasts by 10 to 20 per cent.
The improvement for the year will come from acquisitions and good organic
growth in the US and the UK.
Strong contributions are expected from Erb Lumber, the US distributor of
lumber and associated products bought for Pounds 51.1m last August, and the
first full year of Enertech, the Swedish oil and gas-burner manufacturer.
In the UK the Builders Merchants Federation reported growth of 10 to 12 per
cent, although much of it was in the heavier end of the market, such as
bricks. Wolseley is at the light end where growth has been slower.
The company has continued on the acquisition trail this year, paying Pounds
56.9m for the OAG Group, the biggest distributor of plumbing supplies in
Austria, in April and Pounds 28m for Calumet Holdings of the US in June.
The group, already the leading distributor of professional photographic
equipment in Europe, believes the purchase of Calumet will make it the
largest supplier in the world.
Investors are likely to ask further questions about succession at the
company. Mr Jeremy Lancaster, the chairman and managing director, is nearing
60.
