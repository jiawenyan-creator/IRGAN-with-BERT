FORMATION OF SPLINTER PARTIES 
Ross K. Baker's column "Women's Splinter Party Would Stymie Friends and Comfort 
Enemies" (Op-Ed Page, July 27) expresses that he doesn't have a clue which way 
the political drift is shifting! 
The recent success of the Japanese women in their government is not mentioned 
in Baker's article, while he claims the National Organization for Women (NOW) 
would establish an "American Women's Party on a fool's errand which could not 
even count on the support of Alan Alda," based on his stated belief women have 
such limited issues. 
Mr. Baker, women have more savvy in all matters of life on earth watching, 
hearing, feeling and enduring men in all walks of life running the world in 
gross ignorance, and are more than ready to give their support to a national 
women's party which would also receive a "man-date." 
Your column was the most snide, arrogant, foolish and belittling bias I've read 
in a long time against women. Prof. Baker, wise up!
