BAKER TO VISIT ROMANIA AND BULGARIA 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III will make an unscheduled stop in Romania 
this weekend after his trip to Moscow, the government announced Friday. 
Baker will be the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Romania since the 
December revolution that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Dan 
Radulescu, spokesman for the governing National Salvation Front, said Baker 
would spend "a few hours" in Bucharest, probably Sunday morning. 
In neighboring Bulgaria, the state BTA news agency reported Friday that Baker 
will stop today in Sofia en route from Moscow to Romania. The one-paragraph 
dispatch offered no details beyond saying Baker would arrive in the afternoon. 
It will be the first visit to Bulgaria by a U.S. secretary of state.
