FT  25 JUN 94 / Fund manager fined Pounds 10,000 by Imro
Abbey Unit Trust Managers, the unit trust fund management arm of Abbey Life,
improperly allowed its fund managers to travel to the US and Far East on
trips paid for by commissions generated in trades with stockbrokers,
regulators said yesterday.
Imro, the self-regulating body for the fund management industry, has fined
AUTM Pounds 10,000 and ordered it to pay Pounds 8,000 in costs after an
investigation into its 'soft commission' arrangements.
Mr Paul Leband, director of AUTM and a director of Abbey's fund management
company, said that seven fund managers had accepted Pounds 50,000 of free
travel and accommodation to the US and the Far East between November 1991
and October 1993.
The travel was paid for by two stockbroking firms, one American and one Far
Eastern, through which the fund managers regularly placed
commission-generating trades. Mr Leband said that AUTM had 'misunderstood'
Imro rules relating to soft commissions.
Soft commissions are services which stockbrokers provide to fund managers at
no cost. In exchange the fund managers promise to place an agreed volume of
trades through the stockbrokers, generating commission for them. US
regulators have almost banned the practice because the commissions are paid
out of investors' capital, but UK regulators allow such arrangements within
certain limits.
Imro rules allow the fund managers to accept services which aid them
directly in their research activities, provided the stockbroker with whom
the agreement is struck arranges to buy or sell the stock at the best
available price.
Typically 'softed' services are stockbroker research or computer software
services such as those provided by Datastream, Reuters and others.
Mr Leband said AUTM had mistakenly believed that travel for research
purposes was also a suitable expense for softing purposes.
