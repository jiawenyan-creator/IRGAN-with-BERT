FT  10 MAR 94 / Overheating to dominate congress
China's parliament begins a two-week session today that is certain to be
dominated by concerns over the country's overheating economy and inflation
which exceeded 20 per cent in the big cities last year, writes Tony Walker.
China's Premier Li Peng, in his 'work report', will call for a slowing of
economic activity from 13 per cent last year to 9 per cent this year, but
economists say that such a sharp reduction is unrealistic.
Mr Li, who is beginning the second year of his second five-year term, will
emphasise the need for political and social stability. He can be expected to
give little quarter to international demands for greater political
liberalisation.
This National People's Congress, which will seek further to consolidate
China's economic reforms, is being held in the shadow of the continuing row
with Britain over Hong Kong and against a background of international
concern about China's human rights behaviour. Mr Li will assail Britain over
the breakdown of talks on Hong Kong's future, saying that London should
assume 'full responsibility'.
The NPC will deal with a modest legislative programme in contrast to last
year.
