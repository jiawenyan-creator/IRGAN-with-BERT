Henry Ford in the early 1900s designed the Model "T" to run on grain alcohol. 
His idea was that rural farmers could use their corn and grain to ferment and 
distill their own fuel at little or no cost to the farmer. 
However, the major oil companies talked Ford out of his original idea. 
Ford made the decision to change his carburetor to run on gasoline rather than 
alcohol. He was a genius but he was like the rest of us. He saw a way to get 
rich, rather than realizing the true value of his original idea. Had he 
followed through with his alcohol carburetor, our air would still be clean. The 
oil companies wouldn't have the power to raise prices and we wouldn't be so 
reliant on the Middle East. 
So, maybe the Arab countries aren't any more guilty of greed than Henry Ford 
was.
