Shrimp/stone crab separation zones. 



Five zones are established in the Gulf of Mexico EEZ and Florida's waters off Citrus and Hernando Counties for the separation
of shrimp trawling and stone crab trapping. The zones are as shown in Appendix A of this part, Figure 3. Although Zone
II is entirely within Florida's waters, it is included in this paragraph and Appendix A of this part, Figure 3, for the
convenience of fishermen. Restrictions that apply to Zone II and those parts of the other zones that are in Florida's
waters are contained in Rule 4638.001, Florida Administrative Code. Geographical coordinates of the points
referred to in this section and shown in Appendix A of this part, Figure 3, are as follows (loran readings are unofficial
and are included only for the convenience of fishermen):
