  [Text] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has stated that the NATO 
strike against Serbian positions was an appropriate measure, 
although it was late. He added that it is necessary to halt the 
Serbian aggression by all possible means. The foreign minister 
was commenting on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Regarding the protests against the strike, Foreign Minister 
'Amr Musa said that such protests are incomprehensible. It 
would have been better to protest the aggression, not the 
reaction to the aggression, he added. 
  Commenting on the situation in Rwanda, Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa stated that he telephoned OAU Secretary General Salem Ahmad 
Salem today to discuss the matter. He noted that Salem asked to 
inform President Mubarak, the current OAU chairman, of the 
situation prior to the meeting of the mechanism for settling 
African disputes in Addis Ababa at the ambassadors' level 
tomorrow. He added that the OAU secretary general will be 
informed of President Mubarak's position and instructions. 
  Musa pointed out that the Foreign Ministry is in touch with 
the embassy in Rwanda, adding that it will be closed if things 
get worse. He added that for the moment no instructions have 
been given to close the embassy down so that the situation can 
be viewed from there, since Egypt currently chairs the OAU. 
  Turning to Yemen, the foreign minister said that the 
situation there remains the same and that efforts are continuing 
on the matter. He added that he met with some Yemeni brothers 
in Cairo to follow up on the situation, noting that an Egyptian 
envoy is expected to travel to Yemen soon to try to calm things 
down and assure the safety of the Yemeni people.
