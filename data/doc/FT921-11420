FT  31 JAN 92 / Legal test of VAT ruling goes ahead
TEN COMPANIES are to challenge in the High Court the legality of a decision
by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, requiring them to pay VAT monthly
instead of quarterly from the autumn.
The companies are Allied Lyons, Arjo Wiggins Appleton, Bank of Scotland,
Barclays Bank, British Telecom, Burton Group, Courage, Kingfisher, National
Westminster Bank and Next.
Yesterday the court gave them leave to make an urgent application for
judicial review on the ground that the chancellor had no power to act as he
did.
The companies are also challenging a move by Customs and Excise - as
recorded in a letter to the VAT In Industry Group in November - to implement
Mr Lamont's decision by making new directions under the VAT regulations.
Last October the chancellor announced the government's decision to
reintroduce the 'postponed accounting system' for VAT on goods and related
services acquired from the rest of the European Community. He said it would
cause a one-off cashflow loss to the exchequer in 1992-93.
To prevent any increase in the public-sector borrowing requirement, he
decided the largest VAT traders should account for the tax monthly instead
of quarterly.
That would apply to traders whose net payments exceeded Pounds 2m over the
period covered by their last four quarterly returns up to March 31 this
year.
The companies, which all expect to exceed the Pounds 2m figure, say the
decision will increase administrative costs, affect cashflow and put them at
risk of surcharges and penalties for accounting errors.
