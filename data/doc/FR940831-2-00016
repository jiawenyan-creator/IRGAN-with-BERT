Commissioner of Customs,


Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.




Dear Commissioner: This directive amends, but does not cancel, the directive issued to you on September 15, 1993,
by the Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. That directive directed you to prohibit
entry of certain cotton, wool, man-made fiber, silk blend and other vegetable fiber textile products, produced or
manufactured in Oman for which the Government of the Sultanate of Oman has not issued an appropriate visa.

Effective on October 1, 1994, you are directed to amend the September 15, 1993 directive to include the coverage of
cotton, man-made fiber, silk blend and other vegetable fiber textile products in merged Categories 334/634, 335/635
and 647/648/847, produced or manufactured in Oman and exported from Oman on and after October 1, 1994. Merchandise
in Categories 334/634, 335/635 and 647/648/847 may be accompanied by either the appropriate merged category visa
or the correct category visa corresponding to the actual shipment.

Shipments entered or withdrawn from warehouse according to this directive which are not accompanied by an appropriate
export visa shall be denied entry and a new visa must be obtained.

The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that this action falls within the foreign
affairs exception to the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).

Sincerely,


</SIGNER>
