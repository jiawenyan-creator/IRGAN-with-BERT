  [Text] Moscow, January 21, RIA -- Russia and China hold 
close positions on the possible appearance of nuclear weapons in 
North Korea, Mikhail Bely, the director of the First Asian 
Department, told a news briefing in the Russian Foreign Ministry 
today. 
  According to him, "both sides are concerned at this problem 
and are working to bring North Korea, which has frozen its 
participation in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, back to 
it again". 
  At the same time, said Bely, "there are nuances in the two 
countries' positions on this problem". 
  In particular, the Chinese side is strongly opposed to any 
sanctions in relation to North Korea, while Russia, which does 
not advocate any sanctions and considers them a forced measure, 
believes that the question should be tackled by the whole world 
community.
