  [Text] Diyarbakir, June 28 (AA) -- The trial of the illegal 
Hezbollah organization, which has been connected to the upsurge 
unsolved murders in Diyarbakir and Batman, began here today. 
  The trial of 35 defendants began with the reading of the 
prosecutor's indictment. 
  The indictments gave detailed accounts on the organization's 
charter, foundation, objectives, revenues and actions. 
  The indictment said that the Hezbollah was established 
against PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] and other Marxist 
Leninist organizations in east and southeast Anatolia and aimed 
at establishing a Kurdish state based on the Iranian-type 
Islamic model. 
  Hezbollah, which means Party of God, describes any country 
not administered by the shari'ah, the legal code of Islam, as an 
enemy, it said. 
  The revenues of the Hezbollah were obtained by legal and 
illegal Islamic organizations abroad, books published legally or 
illegally in Turkey and abroad and Koranic courses as well as 
student hostels. 
  The indictment added that the 35 defendants are accused of 
being involved in 39 separate actions in Diyarbakir and Batman, 
killing 25 people and wounding 32. 
  The indictment demanded the death sentence for 15 
defendants, 
15-year prison terms for 15 other defendants and a five-year 
prison term for one defendant.
