  [Text] Moscow March 14 TASS -- The Russian Government "will 
be able to keep monthly inflation within ten per cent" in the 
next few months, according to Russian Minister of Economics 
Aleksandr Shokhin. The announcement was made at his meeting 
with former U.S. President Richard Nixon who is in Moscow on a 
private visit. 
  Shokhin said that the adoption of the budget is a key 
element 
in the activity of the government, stressing that the 
government's "moral status will depend" on the results of the 
debates on the draft budget in the State Duma. 
  Shokhin noted that monthly inflation in February was below 
ten per cent, the record low in the last 2.5 years. "We 
promised to the IMF to reach this level only by the end of the 
year," Shokhin said.
