  [Text] While speaking at a 1 February news conference 
about a government plan to purchase Airborne Warning and Control 
System (AWACS) aircraft, Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], said: "Since the world 
has entered an age of disarmament, it is important for Japan -- 
which embraces a Constitution advocating the preservation of 
peace -- to exercise leadership. In particular, the plan to 
purchase AWACS aircarft should be shelved." The issue of the 
AWACS purchase has become one of the focal points in working out 
the draft national budget for fiscal 1994. Murayama thus 
indicated his opposition to appropriate funds in the draft 
budget for their procurement.
