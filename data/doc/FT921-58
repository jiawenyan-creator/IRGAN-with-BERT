FT  31 MAR 92 / Tesco rejects offer of pay cut
TESCO, the supermarket chain, said yesterday that it was contracting out
security operations at its seven distribution depots even though its 86
staff involved had offered to take pay cuts. Sata, the white-collar section
of the Usdaw shopworkers' union, said the staff were willing to accept about
4 per cent less than the Pounds 4.86 an hour agreed last month.
Mr Frank Murphy, national officer of Sata, said the offer had been a
desperate attempt by the security staff, mostly ex-servicemen or
ex-policemen, to keep their jobs.
Mr Murphy said that Tesco was making contracts with a company advertising
for staff to work between 48 and 60 hours a week for Pounds 3.23 an hour.
