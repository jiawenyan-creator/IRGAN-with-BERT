<F P=106> [Gennadiy Ovchinnikov report; from the "Pacific Ocean" </F>
program] 
  [Text] Sergey Shakhray, vice premier of the Russian 
Federation, arrived in Magadan yesterday. During the tour of 
the Far East, matters ensuring the delivery of cargo to the 
regions of the extreme north for the coming winter will be 
discussed. Before arriving in Magadan, Sergey Shakhray visited 
Krasnoyarsk and Yakutsk. After Magadan, he intends to visit 
Irkutsk and Khabarovsk. Our Magadan correspondent, Gennadiy 
Ovchinnikov, has the details. 
  [Begin Ovchinnikov recording] As the vice premier said at 
his meeting with journalists, his present tour differs radically 
from similar government visits of past years. Primarily, this 
is because he has brought real money for the resupply of the 
northern regions instead of slogans and promises. Sergey 
Shakhray said: I specifically did not leave Moscow for Magadan 
until I succeeded in getting the Ministry of Finance to transfer 
the promised 55 billion rubles here. 
  The system of credits for the delivery of cargo for 
northerners has also been fundamentally changed. From now on, 
the credits will not be undirected as they were last year, when 
the money disappeared without control to numerous traders as 
compensation for transport expenses. Second, the suppliers of 
goods will be prepaid -- that is, they will receive the money 
now and not at the end of the year. In a word, these measures 
are nothing else if not a return to the old, well-proven system 
of supplying the north which existed before perestroyka. 
  The couple of dozen deputy ministers accompanying the vice 
premier solved on the spot almost all of the problems that 
Magadan Oblast had accumulated. The remaining issues apparently 
will be solved at Magadan Airport, during the meeting with the 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who in a day or two will 
make a routine maintenance stop in Magadan on his return to 
Russia from the U.S. [end recording]
