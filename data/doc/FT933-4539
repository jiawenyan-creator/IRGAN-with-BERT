FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank chairman's warning
DEUTSCHE Bank's chairman, Mr Hilmar Kopper, said German banks may have a
tougher time in the second half than they had in the first six months of
this year, Reuter reports from Paris.
'Traditionally, economic crises hit the banking sector with a six to
nine-month delay and I'm not sure German banks will be able to repeat in the
second half of this year their good performances of the first,' he told the
French daily newspaper Les Echos.
