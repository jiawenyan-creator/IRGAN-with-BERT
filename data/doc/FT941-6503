FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: White knight for Aztec Mining
Pancontinental Mining, the diversified Australian mining house, has emerged
as a 'white knight' for Aztec Mining Company, the Sydney-based miner
confronting an unwanted ADollars 261m (USDollars 188m) bid from Mr Robert
Champion de Crespigny's Poseidon Gold, writes Nikki Tait.
Aztec is recommending an all-paper offer from Pancontinental of six
Pancontinental shares and three Pancontinental options for every 16 Aztec
shares. The options have a strike price of ADollars 2.30 and expire at
end-June 1997.
Based on the average price for Pancontinental over the past week, the offer
is worth around ADollars 0.76 per Aztec share, valuing the company at
ADollars 292m. PosGold's cash bid is pitched at ADollars 0.68 a share.
Critically, the new offer has the backing of Aztec's major shareholder, the
US-based Alumax group, which holds 37 per cent of the shares.
