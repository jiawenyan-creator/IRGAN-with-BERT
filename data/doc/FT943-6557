FT  29 AUG 94 / Perkins engine output up 25%
Diesel engine production at Perkins, one of the two largest UK
manufacturers, is running 25 per cent above the levels of last year. That
reflects higher activity in the industrial and construction markets,
especially in the US and the UK.
Daily production is up to 780 engines a day, according to Mr Myles Coleman,
the manufacturing director at Peterborough, the group's main plant, which is
working for nine shifts every five-day week.
Perkins, owned by Varity Corporation of Buffalo, New York, recently reported
sales in the three months to July of Dollars 197m (Pounds 127m), 15 per cent
higher than in the same period last year.
Mr Bruce Anderson, the finance and planning director, said: 'What we've seen
is an acceleration of our basic progress. We've been recovering for 18
months or so.
'Perkins' results are not just a function of the economy. We've successfully
captured a number of accounts.'
Demand for diesel engines has recovered in the UK and the US, but remains
fragile in continental Europe. Sales from Perkins are largely to
manufacturers of construction, electrical and agricultural equipment, whose
growing orders are a response to the level of capital investment.
The other large diesel engine manufacturer in the UK is Cummins, also
US-owned, whose main plant is in Darlington. Its strength is in the market
for road vehicles.
