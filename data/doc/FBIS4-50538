BFN 

  [Text] Washington, May 18 (XINHUA) -- More than 100 U.S. 
House members wrote to President Clinton Tuesday asking him to 
unconditionally renew China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trade 
status. 
  A letter signed by 106 members of the House of 
Representatives called for the creation of a joint human rights 
commission as "a constructive and effective alternative to what 
has become the annual confrontation over renewal of China's MFN 
status." 
  The letter was signed by members of both Democratic and 
Republican parties, including Lee Hamilton (D), chairman of the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee, Sam Gibbons (D), chairman of 
the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade, House minority leader 
Bob Michel (R) and Minority whip Newt Gingrich (R). 
  The letter said, "We have grown increasingly concerned that 
the multilevel policy of engagement with China is now being 
viewed by many primarily in terms of human rights,... we must 
pursue policies specific to each of the issues which divide us 
and offer a realistic chance of positive results." 
  Jim McDermott, one of the sponsors of the letter and 
chairman 
of a bi-partisan task force on U.S.-China policy, said that they 
believed the best way for the United States to influence the 
human rights situation in China is "through honest dialogue, not 
through empty rhetoric, threats and public posturing." 
  Jim Lightfoot (R), the other sponsor of the letter and a 
member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign 
Operations, said that as the June 3 deadline for renewing MFN is 
fast approaching, "we believe this is the time to advance an 
approach that is pro- jobs, pro-human rights and in the interest 
of our national security."
