FT  26 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Sears Roebuck
Sears Roebuck's decision to to pull out of catalogue retailing at least
proves that the company is no longer sentimental about the business which
made it great. It seems Mr Arthur Martinez, brought in last year to give the
backward-looking giant a fresh perspective, can carry the board on tough
issues. Last autumn's announcement that the financial services operations
were to go has now been followed by closure of the worst stores and some
sensible cost-cutting.
But these defensive measures do not add up to a strategy. The core business
has been squeezed between discount retailers and specialist stores. Previous
initiatives such as everyday low pricing of goods have failed to halt the
decline - as UK imitators such as Kingfisher might care to note. Focusing on
a smaller area may concentrate management minds, but there is as yet little
evidence of the required retailing spark. Sears apparently wishes to expand
its women's wear operations, which have improved substantially in recent
years. Yet that will bring it into even closer competition with its rival JC
Penney in a fiercely fought market.
One priority must be to get rid of the company's staid image. That will
require top management to modernise the stores and, more importantly, the
culture of Sears' army of sales staff. Such strategic shifts are tough.
Changing the public image of a retailer is the hardest task of all.
