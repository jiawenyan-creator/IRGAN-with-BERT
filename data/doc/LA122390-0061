PROTECTION OF ENDANGERED SPECIES 
In regard to the story on wildlife "overpopulation" in national parks, 
monuments, etc., I would offer another solution not considered in the article: 
Declare an open season on developers, vacation homeowners, ranchers using 
public lands, logging operation and mineral companies who are in hot pursuit of 
the almighty dollar in the lands surrounding our natural treasures. 
The problem in fact is not too many animals. 
The problem is that there is not enough wild land to keep wildlife wild. 
Attempting to confine wild animals within these artificial boundaries (on 
penalty of death) turns our national parks into nothing more than glorified 
zoos. It is crucial that adequate buffer zones and corridors be protected now 
to preserve this nation's real heritage -- its wild lands and animals.
