METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RESIDENTS OF 13 CITIES WILL NEED TO VOTE 
TWICE 
Voters in 13 San Gabriel Valley cities on Tuesday will not discharge their 
civic duties unless they vote twice. 
In a procedure that officials concede will perplex voters, the county will have 
elections for the 26th and 31st state Senate districts while municipal 
elections are held at some of the same polling places. Voters will cast a city 
ballot, and then receive a Senate ballot to mark. 
A spokeswoman for the county registrar said special elections to fill Senate 
seats vacated by the resignations of William Campbell of Hacienda Heights and 
Joseph Montoya of Whittier were called on such short notice there wasn't time 
to consolidate ballots in many cities.
