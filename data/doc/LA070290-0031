MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH 
Apparent Suicide Leads to Talk Show Host's Firing: A New Orleans radio talk 
show host, whose wife apparently killed herself just hours after calling his 
show to complain about their marital problems, has been fired. Ron Hunter, 51, 
said: "I was expecting the sympathy of my management and my listeners. 
And what I ended up with was being fired . . . eight days after the death of my 
wife." Hunter's wife, Marilou, called his show a little more than a week ago 
and told a guest marriage counselor that they had a troubled marriage. Hours 
later, she was found shot to death in bed, next to Hunter. Authorities say she 
apparently committed suicide. Station officials said Hunter's dismissal had 
been in the works for several weeks, but the final blow was the way he handled 
the call from his wife -- specifically his decision not to cut her off the air 
as soon as he recognized her voice. GREG BRAXTON
