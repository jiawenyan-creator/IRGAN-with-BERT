FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Leasing and Asset Finance (8): Field is not
worth playing on - The problems UK companies face in export leasing
IN RECENT years the UK government has faced increasing pressure from
exporters for greater support for their efforts, particularly as they claim
that they often have to compete on an international playing field which is
far from level.
To some extent, their appeals have been heard with, for example, government
providing additional re-insurance support to buttress the services offered
by short-term export credit insurers and by improving the cost and scope of
medium-term cover offered by the country's official export credit insurer,
the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD).
This has gone some way towards levelling the playing field for exporters who
argue that insurance and other official supports are often greater in
competitor countries. However, one area where UK exporters continue to
remain at a major disadvantage is in export leasing.
Here, it is not a question of an unlevel playing field; the UK tax regime
relating to cross-border asset leasing is such that it is scarcely worth UK
exporters taking to the field at all.
Fundamentally, the problem is that only 10 per cent writing down allowances
(WDAs) are available for assets leased on a cross-border basis, compared
with 25 per cent on domestic leases. Moreover, as the UK Finance and Leasing
Association (FLA) points out, the eligibility of even this low level of WDAs
is heavily restricted.
The current tax treatment of export leasing transactions has been in force
since 1982. The previous year, members of the FLA wrote new leases for
overseas customers valued at Pounds 572m - much of which represented leases
to back sales of UK exports.
At current prices, the 1981 figure translates into business amounting to
around Pounds 1.2bn - an amount which if, indeed, it had been transacted
this year by FLA members, which include such major financial institutions as
Kleinwort Benson and Hambros, would perhaps have involved support of between
Pounds 700m and Pounds 800m for UK exports, according to Mr Andy Thompson,
the FLA's secretary.
The 1982 rules were introduced by the government as a reaction to the
perceived abuses of export leasing which the Inland Revenue believed were
giving rise to a significant leakage of tax revenue.
Not only do the rules involve a low writing down allowance of only 10 per
cent, but the eligibility requirements for even this level are very strict.
Leases, for instance, cannot be written for longer than 13 years, while
lease payments must be evenly-spaced and similar in size. They cannot be
altered to take account of the lessor's own borrowing costs - though changes
can be made if indisputably linked to shifts in base rate movements.
In short, current tax legislation relating to export leasing provides no
'sensible kick' for UK overseas sales, according to Mr Barry Sutton of
London-based lease-structuring experts New Boston Partners, partly owned by
the Bank of Tokyo.
For UK exporters and institutions connected with leasing, the absence of
cross-border leasing as a mechanism for facilitating sales is particularly
irksome, given the favourable climate for leasing fostered by governments in
key competitor countries, such as the United States and Germany.
As Mr Sutton points out, favourable provision for the use of export leasing
is written into the US Tax Code which permits companies exporting goods with
a US content of greater than 50 per cent to structure leasing deals through
an offshore domiciled special purpose company known as a Foreign Sales
Corporation (FSC).
The economic benefits of utilising such a structure can result in savings
equivalent to around 7 or 8 per cent of the price of the asset, says Mr
Sutton. This can either be used to boost competitive advantage or profit
margins, or both.
Meanwhile, in Germany, for example, the value of an asset can be written
down at between 20 to 25 per cent annually, though rates can vary
significantly depending on the nature of the assets involved. Moreover, the
terms of leases qualifying for such writedowns are generally considered much
more flexible, according to the FLA's Mr Thompson.
The FLA is continuing to campaign for a change in the UK law on export
leasing, which it says results in a significant loss to the UK balance of
payments in terms of net earnings on leases and international market
penetration by UK-manufactured goods.
An FLA delegation led by its chairman, Mr Tony Mallin of Hambros, has had
three meetings with the Inland Revenue in recent months to discuss the
situation. The FLA describes the meetings as 'useful' and feels that the
Revenue is seriously considering ways in which cross-border leasing can be
made into a viable export facilitation technique. But the impression is that
no significant change in tax treatment of export leases is imminent.
Another body which may become involved in lobbying the government for change
is the British Exporters Association (Bexa), which groups together
manufacturers and bankers. Mr Keith Johnson, its chairman, says that Bexa,
which has been instrumental in, for example, lobbying for increased
government support for export credit insurance, may apply its own pressure
if UK exporters remain at a competitive disadvantage in this area of export
funding.
