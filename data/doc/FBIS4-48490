  [Text] The Angolan Government air force is still bombing 
UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] 
areas in Uige and Negage. Citing a military source in Luanda, 
the Portuguese news agency LUSA says the bombings are being 
carried out at a high altitude, thus hindering their accuracy. 
The source said the bombings are designed to prevent UNITA from 
moving reinforcements from Uige Province to retake N'Dalatando, 
which was captured by government forces early this month.
