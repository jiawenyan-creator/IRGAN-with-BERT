FT  17 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow higher in wake of
inflation figures
Wall Street
Leading US stocks posted solid gains yesterday, but the rest of the market
ended mostly flat amid confusion about the implications of a lower than
expected increase in consumer prices and Tuesday's tightening of monetary
policy by the Federal Reserve, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 18.84 up at 3,845.20. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 was 0.57 firmer at 465.60, while the American Stock Exchange
composite eased 0.22 to 448.39 and the Nasdaq composite edged forward 0.63
to 769.65. New York SE volume came to 297m shares.
The Dow rose by more than 10 points in early trading after the Labor
Department reported consumer prices for October, excluding food and energy,
rose by 0.2 per cent, while analysts had expected a 0.3 per cent increase.
Overall, consumer prices were up 0.1 per cent last month, bringing yearly
inflation down to 2.6 per cent, from 3.0 per cent in September. Economists
had forcast a 0.1 per cent increase in overall prices.
Initially neither the stock nor the bond markets were able to sustain the
morning gains, but late in the afternoon the Dow made a strong comeback,
while the other indices remained flat or declined.
Mr Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at securities firm Merrill Lynch,
attributed the volatility to uncertainty about the impact of the Fed's 75
basis-point increase in the Fed Funds rate. Markets had expected a rise of
50 basis points, to 5 1/4 per cent.
'It is sort of a double-edged sword,' he said, adding that it could lead to
a bond market rally that might temporarily lift stocks but in the longer run
shares could be hurt by a slowing of the economy.
In the near term, he said, whatever happened in the markets over the next
few days could determine whether the market staged an end of year rally.
'Whichever way it starts to go, you will get a following and you will see
more money going in that direction,' he added. 'If it does hold up or go up,
maybe it will blossom into a late November-early December rally.'
Still, he foresaw overall weakness in most of the stock averages over the
medium to long term.
