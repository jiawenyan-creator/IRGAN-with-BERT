  [Text] Nicaragua will receive more than $10 million from 
the German Government as part of two important agreements signed 
on 3 June at the Foreign Cooperation Ministry. 
  The two agreements, signed by Nicaraguan Foreign Cooperation 
Minister Erwin Kruger Maltez and German Ambassador to Nicaragua 
Helmut Schieps, establish that $1.2 million will be in donations 
and $9.1 million in loans. 
  The first agreement, dubbed the "Fund for Research and 
Specialists II," is for $1.2 million consisting of funding for 
reports and secondary research, as well as for assessment in 
preparing documentation for projects involving German 
cooperation. 
  The second agreement, dubbed the "Emergency Fund for Social 
Investments II," is aimed at offsetting the negative effects of 
the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, ESAF, by taking 
special steps to modify the social infrastructure. This 
agreement will generate a large amount of manual labor and 
proffers to comply with the criteria of the creation of jobs and 
alleviation of poverty. 
  Carlos Noguera, of the Emergency Fund for Social Investments 
(FISE), was present at the signing of the agreements and said 
these funds would triple the number of projects throughout the 
country.
