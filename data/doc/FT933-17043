FT  01 JUL 93 / Security ring around the City to combat terrorism
A SECURITY CORDON of 24-hour police checkpoints is to be thrown around the
City of London as part of an anti-terrorist campaign after recent bomb
attacks.
The measures, backed by the Home Office, will be put into operation this
weekend.
Police at the six main routes into the City will monitor and stop suspicious
vehicles. Other entry roads will be blocked.
The measures, due to stay in place for a year, are the first stage in a
broader plan to be announced at the end of the week. Non-essential traffic
would be restricted, and police and video camera surveillance increased. The
moves will probably need parliamentary approval.
Mr Owen Kelly, the commissioner of the City of London Police, met Mr Michael
Cassidy, chairman of the Corporation of London's policy committee, yesterday
to finalise details.
Mr Cassidy said the area covered by the security ring would be 'considerably
smaller' than the square mile, focusing on the Bank of England headquarters.
The checkpoints would not act as road blocks and 'most people will probably
notice no difference'.
'This is not a 'ring of steel' around the City,' he added.
Against a background of concern that the measures might be seen as an IRA
propaganda coup, the Corporation of London was at pains to play down the
move. It pointed out that vehicle surveillance was already carried out in
the City, after the Bishopsgate bombing two months ago.
City businesses and banks gave the proposals a cautious welcome, although
they emphasised that until the fuller set of proposals was in force, it
would be impossible to predict the impact on the City's reputation.
'As long as emergency vehicle access was maintained, and the City was able
to function as a financial institution, we would welcome the tightening of
security,' the Stock Exchange said.
