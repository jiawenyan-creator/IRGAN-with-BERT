FT  14 NOV 92 / French industry investing less
French industrial investment will fall by 11 per cent in volume this year
and is expected to stage a fragile 1 per cent recovery in 1993, according to
the latest survey by Insee, the state statistics body, William Dawkins
writes from Paris.
The study, based on a poll of 2,500 companies in October, reflects corporate
France's deepening gloom as the growth in domestic demand continues to
weaken.
