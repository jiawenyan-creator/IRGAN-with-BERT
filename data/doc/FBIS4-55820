  [Text] Novi Sad, 21 May (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, 
speaker of the People's Assembly of the Serb republic, said in 
an interview for DNEVNIK of Novi Sad -- to be published tomorrow 
-- that the latest arrangement by the West on the division of 
Bosnia was detrimental to the Serbs. "How else would one 
interpret the 51-49 agreement given that Serbs own 64 percent of 
the entire territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
control even more land than that?, asked Krajisnik. 
  "The proposed percentage could in the future create a real 
chaos with far-reaching consequences, and the Serb republic 
parliament will discuss everything in detail at its next 
session," he announced. 
  The world has finally realized that the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina must be divided, Krajisnik said, warning that 
the Serb republic would not allow its territorial integrity to 
be disturbed. 
  Commenting on reports of a possible withdrawal of the 
peace-keeping forces, Krajisnik said that the UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] should remain in this former Yugoslav 
republic, but that it must adopt a completely neutral stand 
which, unfortunately, has not been the case so far as the 
UNPROFOR has even openly been siding with the Muslims, Krajisnik 
said.
