SUMMARY:

 On October 1, 1993, (58 FR 51279) the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed rulemaking in response to an
October 22, 1990, Petition for Reconsideration filed with the Administrator. This Petition requested that EPA reconsider
and revise the requirements of the Chicago Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Ozone (which was promulgated June
29, 1990 (55 FR 26814)) as they pertain to Stepan Company's Millsdale Plant (Stepan) manufacturing facility in Elwood,
Illinois.



On December 2, 1993 (58 FR 63547) at the request of Stepan, EPA extended the comment period until December 16, 1993.
On December 2, 1993, Stepan requested that the comment period be extended until February 15, 1994 based upon the complexity
of the proposed rule and issues raised about the content of the record. At Stepan's request EPA is extending the public
comment period until February 15, 1994.
