FT  03 SEP 93 / House prices up again in August
HOUSE PRICES rose in August according to figures released yesterday by
Halifax and Nationwide, the two largest building societies.
The societies differed on the size of the increase. Halifax's seasonally
adjusted figures showed a rise of 0.8 per cent, following a 0.9 per cent
increase in July.
Nationwide, which does not make seasonal adjustments to its figures,
reported a fractional increase of 0.1 per cent after a 0.7 per cent rise the
previous month. Both indices showed that prices were still lower - by just
over 2 per cent - last month compared with August 1992.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations director, said: 'House prices have
increased every month since February and this seems to confirm the general
trend towards greater stability and confidence in the market. Even in
August, a traditionally quiet holiday month, we have seen the gradual
strengthening of the market maintained.' Nationwide expects house prices to
have shown a 'modest' increase by the end of the year compared with the end
of 1992.
Halifax is also cautiously optimistic but it warns that there may yet be
month-on-month falls, repeating a pattern traced by its index in the year to
date. The society reported price falls in the first two months of the year
and then again in May and June.
Halifax said: 'The overall trend in house prices during 1993 has been flat
and the likelihood is that prices will end the year slightly above their
level at the beginning of the year.'
Halifax said prices had fallen by 2.3 per cent in the past 12 months. But it
expects prices to show annual increases within the next few months as the
sharp monthly falls which occurred in September and October last year are
overtaken in annual comparisons.
