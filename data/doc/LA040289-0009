WALK LIKE A MAN 
Unfortunately for us all, women still do struggle to fit into a man's world. 
But Littwin's use of an aerobics class to condemn this struggle further 
exemplifies a self-defeating attitude. Is it that women do aerobics and men 
make decisions in the board room? By her attacking her male counterpart in an 
aerobics class (on her turf, so to speak) at best defies the basic concept of a 
symmetry between men and women and at worst exemplifies a further separation of 
the sexes, and by a woman, yet.
