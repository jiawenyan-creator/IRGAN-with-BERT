FT  11 FEB 93 / Japanese car industry welcomes US decision not to file
dumping suit
THE Japanese car industry and authorities yesterday welcomed the decision by
the US big three car-makers not to file a dumping suit against Japanese
manufacturers, but expressed continuing concern over protectionist
tendencies in the US, Michiyo Nakamoto writes from Tokyo.
The ministry of international trade and industry said the decision reflected
a sensible judgment. Mr Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan automobile
manufacturers' association, said it was the 'right decision'. He reiterated
the industry's belief it had not been dumping in the US market.
