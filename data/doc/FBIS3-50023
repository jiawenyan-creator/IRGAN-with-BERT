  [Text] Piestany, west Slovakia, Jan 14 (CTK) -- Czech 
Interior Minister Jan Ruml and his Slovak counterpart Jozef 
Tuchyna agreed on a solution for three disputed border areas, 
they told journalists today. Both parties accepted the idea 
that an optimum solution had to suit people on both sides of the 
border, they said. 
  The fourth and last disputed area -- the Kasarna recreation 
grounds -- is yet to be discussed by the two countries' premiers. 
  In keeping with petitions by the people who live there, the 
ministers recommend that the Slovak village Sidonia be joined 
with the Czech Republic and, conversely, the U Sabotu 
neighborhood be joined with Slovakia. The 123 hectares acquired 
by the Czech Republic as a result of the straightening of the 
course of the river Morava will be compensated for by an extra 
area of U Sabotu and a railway station near Vrbovce. 
  On the basis of the two ministers' recommendations, a 
national frontier bill is to be drawn up for consideration in 
the parliaments of their respective countries.
