FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: French results disappoint
THE depressing stream of French corporate announcements continued yesterday
with the disclosure of flat first-half sales from several companies,
including Pechiney in aluminium and Schneider in engineering, and the news
that Random, a group of computer distribution companies, was in judicial
receivership.
Random - founded in 1982 and quoted on France's second market - had built up
a business with sales of FFr1.1bn (Dollars 223m) last year. However, it
reported a loss of FFr44m in 1991. It said yesterday that it envisaged even
higher losses for 1992, making it difficult for it to service its debt, now
FFr300m. Random's management hoped its partners, Compunet in Germany and
Computacenter in the UK might be interested in a rescue.
