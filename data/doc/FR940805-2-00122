$.001 Par Value; 63/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures Due 2003) File No. 110600</DOCTITLE>



August 1, 1994.



Maxxim Medical, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d22(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified securities from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing these securities from listing and registration include the
following:

According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock and convertible subordinated debentures
are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock and 63/4% Convertible Subordinated
Debentures commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on December 22, 1993 and concurrently therewith
such stock was suspended from trading on the Amex.

In making the decision to withdraw its Common Stock and 63/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures from listing on
the Amex, the Company considered the direct and indirect costs and expenses attendant in maintaining the dual listing
of its Common Stock and 63/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures on the NYSE and on the Amex. The Company does not
see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its Common Stock and 63/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures
and believes that dual listing would fragment the market for the Common Stock and 63/4% Convertible Subordinated
Debentures.

Any interested person may, on or before August 22, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.
