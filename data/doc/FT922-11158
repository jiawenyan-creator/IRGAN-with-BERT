FT  28 APR 92 / Pay deal agreed in Norway
Norway's main trade union group agreed a wage deal with employers for
300,000 workers yesterday, but 2,000 seamen went on strike, halting vital
ferry services, Reuter reports from Oslo.
'We didn't get what we wanted on every point, but we're advising our members
to accept the deal,' said Yngve Haagensen, head of the main LO union
grouping after all-night talks with the Confederation of Norwegian Business
and Industry.
The deal, averting a threatened strike by 12,000 of the confederation's
300,000 private sector members, would give modest wage rises, with the
lowest-paid benefiting most.
