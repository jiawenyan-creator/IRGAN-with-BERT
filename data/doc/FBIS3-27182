  [Text] Islamabad, February 21 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Vice-Premier and foreign minister Qian Qichen arrived here this 
evening on a four-day official good-will visit to Pakistan. 
  Pakistan is the first leg of his fortnight official visit to 
five Asian countries including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives 
and Iran. 
  Qian was greeted by Pakistan Foreign Minister Sardar Asif 
Ahmad Ali and Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Zhou Gang at 
Islamabad International Airport. 
  In a written statement issued at the airport, Qian said 
Sino-Pakistan friendship is time-tested. 
  He said since the establishment of diplomatic relations 
between the two countries over 40 years ago, bilateral ties have 
seen an all around development and serve as a model of state to 
state relations. 
  It is the unswerving policy of the Chinese Government to 
further strengthen the friendship and cooperation between the 
two countries which are not only in the interest of our two 
peoples but also conducive to the maintenance of peace and 
stability in this region and Asia as a whole, he said. 
  "I believe that my current visit will serve to enhance our 
mutual understanding, deepen our friendship, expand our 
cooperation and push the existing friendly relations and 
cooperation between the two countries to a new height," he said.
