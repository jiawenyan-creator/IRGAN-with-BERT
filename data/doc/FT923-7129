FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Court approves Pfizer settlement
PFIZER, one of the largest US drug companies, yesterday said a federal court
had approved its previous agreement to settle a class action suit over
Pfizer's Shiley heart valves.
In January, Pfizer said it would commit up to Dollars 505m to cover claims
of Shiley heart valve recipients, including more than Dollars 200m to settle
the lawsuit plus Dollars 300m in pre-tax reserves. The company has not
admitted the valve is defective.
The settlement includes a fund of Dollars 75m for valve-related research, a
medical consultation fund of up to Dollars 140m to allow class members pay
for consultation with a cardiologist or other health care provider and a
guaranteed compensation programme for any claimants whose valves fracture.
Although the settlement was widely expected, analysts said it was an
important milestone for Pfizer. Mr Viren Mehta, an analyst at Mehta and
Isaly in New York, said: 'Pfizer needs to get Shiley behind it, and this
novel settlement will go a long way towards achieving that goal.'
Pfizer, which estimates the pre-tax cost of the settlement at between
Dollars 165m to Dollars 215m, said the costs would be substantially offset
by other items. It does not expect the settlement to have a material impact
on its 1992 earnings.
