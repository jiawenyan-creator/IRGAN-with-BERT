  [Text] Belgrade, March 13 (TANJUG)--Moslem-Croat clashes in 
central Bosnia-Herzegovina continue despite Saturday's military 
agreement on forming joint armed forces and Croat forces 
continue the destruction of Moslem religious objects. 
  Zagreb-based Croatian Radio reports on Sunday that Moslem 
units early that day attacked Bosnian Croat Army (HVO) positions 
in the area of Novi Travnik, central Bosnia. The Moslem Army, 
the source claims, fired explosive devices at Croat positions 
and opened fire from infantry weapons. 
  Meanwhile, Moslem-held Radio Sarajevo accuses "HVO 
extremists" of being against peace in central Bosnia. Croat 
troops attacked Moslem positions in the area of Zavidovici from 
infantry weapons and long-range rifles on Saturday, Radio 
Sarajevo says. 
  The radio says that Croat troops on Saturday also opened 
fire 
at the village of Vrhovine near Gornji Vakuf, where a Moslem 
soldier was wounded. Croat forces launched attacks on Moslem 
positions in the area of Kiseljak (to the west of Sarajevo) and 
near-by Fojnica, Radio Sarajevo says. 
  In Gromoljak, a village near Kiseljak, Croats blew up and 
razed the last mosque in this area two nights ago, so that there 
are now no Moslem religious objects there, Radio Sarajevo says 
in today's broadcasts. 
  On Sunday morning, regardless of their holiday of Bairam, 
the 
Moslems continued fierce attacks on the Brcko area, northern 
Bosnia. 
  The attack started at 0530 local time when Moslem units 
fired 
about 40 mortar shells on Serb defense lines from their 
positions to the south-west and west of Brcko. 
  Meanwhile, local Croat forces (HVO) in the Orasje area, 
north-west of Brcko, fired from small arms on Serb positions. 
  Bosnian Serb forces were forced to return fire, after which 
the attacks abated.
