FT  23 FEB 93 / Arts: Today's Television
Starting unfortunately early at 6.00, BBC2 shows the best Robin Hood movie
ever made, the 1938 Warner version with Errol Flynn: The Adventures Of Robin
Hood. Shot in early Technicolor, with superior music by Erich Korngold and
memorable performances from Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains as the baddies,
it is a classic example of Hollywood at its most entertaining.
Assignment (7.45 BBC2) reports on the re-emergence of malaria as a major
hazard. In parts of Africa and Asia the disease is once again out of control
and this year it is expected to kill two million people.
ITV launches Comedy Playhouse, a collection of eight half-hour comedies
which are being tried out for possible new series. Today's, set in a talent
agency, is written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor who created the excellent
'Red Dwarf' series (8.30).
Without Walls (9.00 C4) tries to establish whether the use of drugs by
writers and artists has led to the creation of anything worthwhile. 40
Minutes, now edited by the estimable Paul Watson, examines a clinic for
anorectic adolescents.
