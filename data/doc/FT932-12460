FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: Bryant to raise Pounds 18m for land
purchases
BRYANT GROUP yesterday became the latest housebuilder to raise funds to buy
land in what increasingly looks like the beginning of a housing market
recovery.
It is raising about Pounds 18m from a placing of 13m shares at 137 1/2 p.
Following the announcement the shares fell 2p to 142p.
The placing is through SG Warburg Securities. Dealings are expected to start
on Friday.
Mr Colin Hope, chairman, said: 'The revival in new house purchasers'
confidence since the beginning of this year is extremely encouraging. Our
net reservations since December 1 are more than 30 per cent ahead of the
comparable period a year ago.'
The group, in addition to purchasing land in its existing areas, has formed
a subsidiary in Edinburgh and is in the process of establishing itself in
north-east England.
A division has been set up to build smaller developments of luxury homes in
Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Warwickshire.
Earlier this year the group announced that first half pre-tax profits had
fallen from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 7.5m. The interim dividend was held at
1.4p.
Borrowings of Pounds 9.3m at the half year represented gearing of just 5 per
cent. This excluded Pounds 20m associated company borrowings attributable to
Bryant.
