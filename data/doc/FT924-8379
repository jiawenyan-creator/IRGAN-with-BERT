FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: General Accident's Pounds 37m loss blamed
on Hurricane Andrew
HEAVIER-THAN-expected claims from Hurricane Andrew in the US left General
Accident, the composite insurer, nursing pre-tax losses of Pounds 36.7m for
the nine months to September 30 but masked an underlying improvement in the
UK and the Far East.
Losses from the hurricane amounted to Pounds 38m, some Pounds 7m more than
originally estimated.
GA suffered losses of Pounds 31m on its direct US business and a further
Pounds 7m on its reinsurance portfolio. US underwriting losses rose to
Pounds 136.6m (Pounds 89.6m).
In the UK, the company reported a continuing improvement on its domestic
motor and householders' business, largely reflecting rate increases, more
selective underwriting and reduced costs.
Losses from motor policies were reduced by over 50 per cent to Pounds 50.5m.
Premium income fell to Pounds 268.2m (Pounds 308.5m) despite average rate
increases of about 15 per cent.
The houseowners' insurance account also improved, with a Pounds 2.2m profit
in the third quarter. Over the nine months the account was only marginally
in the red with losses of Pounds 1.3m, compared with Pounds 34.5m.
Subsidence claims fell from Pounds 30m to Pounds 17.3m.
Anticipating greater profitability in this area GA aims to increase its
exposure.
It has agreed to acquire a block of 216,000 policies sold by Cheltenham and
Gloucester and formerly underwritten by Municipal Mutual, the local
authority-owned insurer which withdrew from the market this year.
The deficit on the commercial property account was also reduced, from Pounds
53.4m to Pounds 23.1m.
Losses from mortgage indemnity policies, which insure mortgage lenders
against losses on sales of repossessed houses, fell to Pounds 32m (Pounds
35m).
Overall UK underwriting losses were down to Pounds 133.1m (Pounds 259.7m),
with premium income ahead at Pounds 920.1m (Pounds 906.9m).
Elsewhere, Canadian underwriting losses increased to CDollars 11.9m (Pounds
5.9m) compared with CDollars 1.5m last year, but losses in the Pacific fell
from Pounds 20m to Pounds 5.2m.
Net investment earnings increased to Pounds 301.5m (Pounds 276m). Estate
agency losses increased to Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 11.9m). Long term profits
were virtually unchanged at Pounds 22.4m (Pounds 22.2m).
