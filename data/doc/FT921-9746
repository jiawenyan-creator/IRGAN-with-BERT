FT  11 FEB 92 / FFr28m lost at Le Monde due to slump
France's independent daily newspaper Le Monde said yesterday it had lost
FFr28m (Dollars 5.17m) in 1991 because of a slump in advertising revenue,
and could only hope to break even this year, Reuter reports from Paris.
Director Jacques Lesourne said that despite a price increase and cuts in
staff and running costs the respected evening newspaper lost FFr13m more
than forecast.
The newspaper's loss in 1990 was FFr39m.
