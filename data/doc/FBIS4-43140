  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Here in the Netherlands, the 
Christian Democrats won 10 of the 31 seats reserved for the 
Netherlands at Strasbourg. Eight seats went to Labor, six to 
the right-wing liberals -- VVD party [People's Party for Freedom 
and Democracy] -- and four to the centrist D66 party. Fringe 
parties such as the protestants took two seats, and one seat 
went to the Green Left environmentalists. Official results are 
expected later today.
