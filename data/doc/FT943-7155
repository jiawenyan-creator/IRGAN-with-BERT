FT  25 AUG 94 / Sri Lanka plans to lift Jaffna embargo
Sri Lanka's new government is planning to remove an economic embargo on the
northern Jaffna peninsula controlled by Tamil rebels, Mr Anuruddha Ratwatte,
deputy defence minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Colombo.
'We are discussing lifting the embargo with the service chiefs because we
want to relieve the pressure on the local population,' he stated. The people
of Jaffna were suffering from a scarcity of food, and high prices of basic
goods.
The previous government imposed a goods embargo on the north covering 42
items, including batteries, electronic toys, sweets, bullion, medicines,
fuel and matches. It said the goods could be used by the Tamil rebels in
their war against government forces.
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have been fighting in the north and
east for a separate state for their minority Tamil community. Their
stronghold is Jaffna.
Mr Ratwatte said the government's priority was to end the war, which has
cost more than 30,000 lives, through a negotiated political solution. 'The
prime minister has asked them to come for talks. We are waiting for a
response.'
The government would confine to the north and east a state of emergency,
enforced countrywide after last week's parliamentary elections. The People's
Alliance triumphed in last week's election, defeating the United National
party which had ruled for 17 years.
