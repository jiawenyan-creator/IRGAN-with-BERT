<F P=106> [Unattributed staff interview with Philippe Bourdeau, </F>
responsible for the European Environment Agency within the EU 
Commission; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [LES ECHOS] Why create a new Community institution 
devoted to the environment? 
  [Bourdeau] Hitherto, Community policy in the environmental 
sphere was limited to drawing up European directives and 
regulations. We did not have the means to monitor the effect of 
these directives on the environment. Hence the idea, launched 
by Jacques Delors in 1989, for a monitoring body capable of 
delivering objective, reliable, and comparable information on 
the state of the environment in Europe. 
  [LES ECHOS] Is this not redundant with the work Eurostat is 
carrying out already? 
  [Bourdeau] Eurostat is complementary, because it does not 
supply information on the state of the environment but economic 
data. These will be used by the Environment Agency in the 
framework of its work. For instance, in the case of a study on 
the influence of automobile traffic on air pollution or on the 
greenhouse effect, the Agency will compare its data on pollution 
with Eurostat's data on the automobile. 
  [LES ECHOS] Who will have access to the Agency's work? 
  [Bourdeau] The Commission, the member states, and the 
public, especially through the widest publication of a report on 
the state of the environment which will be updated every three 
years. But also through more specific studies, like studies on 
substances which affect the ozone layer, or on waste 
transportation. The choice of these special themes will be made 
in accordance with the preparation of European directives or at 
the request of the member states. But associations and 
enterprises will also be able to turn to the Agency to express 
their desire to have a particular subject studied. Although it 
is premature, it is not impossible to imagine that special 
studies may eventually be commissioned from the Agency. 
  [LES ECHOS] How long will it take before the Agency is fully 
operational? 
  [Bourdeau] The staff, 45 to 50 people, should be recruited 
by the end of 1995. Although things can be done before then, 
the Agency will not really be fully operational until mid-1995. 
At that time, new tasks might also be entrusted to it. For 
instance, the verification of the effective implementation of 
directives by the member states or the definition of 
environmental impact criteria for the establishment of ecolabels. 
  [LES ECHOS] Is the multiplication of national correspondents 
in "focal points" and in "thematic centers" not likely to make 
this institution difficult to manage? 
  [Bourdeau] Our aim is not to create new structures but to 
set up a network which is efficient. Our correspondents in each 
country will be the focal points. They may be big, as in 
Germany where the Federal Environment Agency will be our 
interlocutor, or smaller, as in France, with the French 
Environment Agency [IFEN]. But, for some specific tasks, the 
Agency will contract out work to specialized centers for limited 
periods and these will be much smaller in size. For instance, 
if we are carrying out a study on pollution in the 
Mediterranean, it is natural to try to use a specialized center 
chosen through a call for bids. The situation strikes me as 
perfectly manageable.
