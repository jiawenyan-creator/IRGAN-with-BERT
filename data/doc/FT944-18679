FT  03 OCT 94 / Investors are told to check advisers
Investors seeking independent financial advice should check that their
adviser is still authorised, the new financial services industry regulator
warned yesterday.
At least 13 groups have had their authorisation revoked for failing to meet
the midnight Friday deadline for applications to join the Personal
Investment Authority, which is replacing Fimbra as the main regulator for
independent financial advisers.
Advisers who did not want to join the PIA had to give notice before the
deadline that they were planning to leave the business, become tied agents,
join a network or apply to another regulator. They could then keep their
authorisation until the end of the year or until accepted or rejected by
another regulator.
Those which took no action by the deadline automatically lost their
authorisation with immediate effect. It is a criminal offence for
unauthorised advisers to conduct investment business, and their customers
are not covered by compensation schemes.
The Securities and Investments Board has not been able to confirm whether
125 groups which said they would apply to other regulators had actually done
so by the deadline. If not, their authorisation will also be revoked
immediately.
Fimbra used to regulate about 5,300 independent financial advisers. Although
final numbers are not yet known, it appears that the PIA has received at
least 4,900 applications, but more than 400 of them were from firms
previously regulated by other bodies. About 2,000 applications have already
been approved.
