FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: PWA loss increases sharply
PWA Corporation, holding company of Canadian Airlines International,
yesterday announced a heavy 1991 loss, bringing the combined deficit of
Canada's two main airlines last year to almost CDollars 400m (USDollars
336m).
Mr Rhys Eyton, PWA's chairman, forecast another difficult year in 1992 and
confirmed outsiders' predictions that a restructuring of the beleaguered
industry was on the cards through rationalisation and alliances with foreign
airlines.
PWA's loss was CDollars 161.7m, or CDollars 3.66 a share, up from a CDollars
14.6m loss, or 60 cents, in 1990. Air Canada last week posted a 1991 loss of
CDollars 218m. The airline's fourth-quarter loss was CDollars 68.7m, up from
CDollars 34.2m a year earlier.
PWA's preferred route has been to find a strong equity partner among the
leading US airlines. The company has been rumoured to be in talks for
American Airlines to acquire a stake of up to 49 per cent.
But Air Canada has lobbied against greater foreign involvement and appears
to favour a merger or some other form of rationalisation involving the two
airlines.
The struggle between the two has intensified recently as each seeks to
ensure it emerges as the undisputed main carrier.
Air Canada has increased capacity on both domestic and international routes.
It has unsuccessfully tried to block a Canadian TV advertisement showing
passengers walking from an Air Canada cabin into a Canadian aircraft.
PWA's operating revenues rose by 4.6 per cent last year to CDollars 2.87bn.
The operating loss was CDollars 90.4m, compared with a 1990 loss of CDollars
11.7m.
Mr Eyton said that the company had yet to see firm evidence of a recovery.
