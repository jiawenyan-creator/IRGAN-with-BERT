  [Excerpt] The new Colombian Environment Ministry began 
operations this morning with the swearing in of its first 
minister, Manuel Rodriguez. From now on all public works, 
industry, and service projects will require an environmental 
license. 
  The new ministry will enjoy super powers to protect the 
environment and the country's renewable natural resources. Law 
No. 99 of 1993, which created the new ministry, gave it police 
duties and the authority to impose fines on violators of 
environmental norms. [passage omitted]
