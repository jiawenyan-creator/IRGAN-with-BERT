FT  18 FEB 94 / People: Sir George Russell to regenerate economy of his
stamping-ground
Sir George Russell, chairman of the Independent Television Commission, is to
succeed Sir Ron Dearing as chairman of the Northern Development Company, the
economic regeneration body for north east England and Cumbria.
Both men have strong connections with the area; while in his thirties, Sir
Ron became the regional director for a group of government departments
charged with fostering industrial and commercial development.
Sir George (right), 58, non-executive chairman of both Marley and venture
capital group 3i, was born in Gateshead and educated at Durham University;
he retains a holiday home on Holy Island, off the Northumberland coast.
Sir Ron, 63, chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority and
of the Camelot national lottery bid, steps down on March 31 from the
chairmanship of the NDC after serving four years.
In Sir George, the NDC, a partnership formed in the mid-1980s by the private
sector, local authorities and trades unions, has again found a high-profile
public figure with a strong commitment to the region, coupled with
disinterest in the Pounds 14,000 a year salary the NDC chairmanship carries.
Sir Ron took only part of that sum and Sir George has indicated he will not
be collecting any of it for himself.
