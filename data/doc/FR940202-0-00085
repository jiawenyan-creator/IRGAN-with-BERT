 

Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17, are the Director's findings concerning
the proposed amendment to the Illinois program submitted on August 17, 1993. Revisions not addressed below involve
nonsubstantive working changes.



1. 225 ILCS 720/2.11_Procedures for Approval



(a) Illinois is proposing to make minor, non-substantive language changes at sections 2.11(a), (b), (c), and (g)
to clarify the provisions of these sections. The Director finds that the proposed revisions are in accordance with
section 514 of SMCRA.

(b) At section 2.11(c), Illinois is also proposing to prohibit any party to a formal adjudicatory hearing under this
subsection from seeking judicial review of the Department's final decision on the permit application until after
the issuance of the hearing officer's written decision granting or denying the permit. Additionally, notices of
permit decision hearings must be published seven to fourteen days before the hearing and comply with certain size
and placement requirements.

In a letter to OSM dated November 22, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IL1516), Illinois clarified that: (a)
A permit applicant must seek administrative review prior to seeking judicial review under the provisions of section
2.11(f); (b) the provisions in section 2.11(c) pertaining to exhaustion of administrative remedies would not apply
to the hearing officer's final written decision for temporary relief under section 2.11(e); and (c) if the hearing
officer fails to act within prescribed time frames, judicial review of his failure to act is required per the implementing
provisions of 62 Ill. Admin. Code 1847.3(1)(2).

Although section 514(f) of SMCRA does not contain the provision proposed at section 2.11(c) pertaining to judicial
review, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 775.13(a)(2) provide for judicial review if a hearing or regulatory authority
fails to render a decision within the specified time limits. The Director finds that the proposed revision when read
in conjunction with 62 Illinois Administrative Code 1847.3(1)(2) is consistent with the Federal regulations at
30 CFR 775.13(a)(2).

Section 514(c) of SMCRA does not contain the provision proposed at section 2.11(c) pertaining to notices of permit
decision hearings. However, the Director finds the proposed revision in accordance with the requirements of section
514(c) of SMCRA.



2. 225ILCS 720/6.01_Requirement of a Bond



Illinois is proposing to add a provision at section 6.01(b) to permit the Department to accept the bond of the applicant,
without separate surety, when the applicant demonstrates to the Department's satisfaction the existence of a suitable
agent to receive service of process, a history of financial solvency and continuous operation, and a current financial
soundness sufficient for authorization to self-insure or bond the required amount.

The Director finds that the new section 6.01(b) is not less stringent than the provisions of section 509(c) of SMCRA
to the extent that states are provided with the authority to establish self-bonding systems. However, prior to implementation
of this statutory amendment, the Director is requiring that Illinois submit and receive the approval by OSM of supporting
regulations to implement the self-bonding provisions of the statute.
