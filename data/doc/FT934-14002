FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Tottenham warning clips share price
TOTTENHAM Hotspur's shares closed 6p lower at 109p yesterday after the north
London football club issued a profits warning following the cost of
unexpected repairs to its East Stand.
As a result of year-end provisions totalling about Pounds 1.4m the group
said pre-tax profits for the year to May 31 would be about Pounds 3.3m,
somewhat lower than earlier estimates.
Twice during the bitter summer battle for control of the club between Mr
Alan Sugar and Mr Terry Venables, Tottenham was forced to make a statement
to the Stock Exchange following unauthorised public statements by Mr
Venables about company profits.
In the second statement, issued on July 27, Tottenham said that pre-tax
profits for the 10 months to March 31 were approximately Pounds 4m.
Yesterday, the company confirmed that subsequent trading had continued to be
profitable but added that its full-year profits 'will be subject to certain
year-end provisions for items such as legal expenses and the costs of
unexpected major repairs to the East Stand'.
Tottenham's results are due to be announced by November 5.
Mr Colin Sandy, finance director, said yesterday that the repairs to the
stand involved replacing wooden floorboards that had been treated with a
fire-retardant chemical during refurbishment in 1988-89. Subsequently they
developed wet and dry rot and have had to be replaced with steel.
