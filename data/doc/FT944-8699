FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Black dares Murdoch to end war
Mr Conrad Black, chairman of The Telegraph group, yesterday challenged Mr
Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, to end the UK's national
newspaper price-cutting war.
Mr Black, who was in Melbourne for the annual meeting of John Fairfax, a
Daily Telegraph associate company, said: 'He started the war, he can finish
it.'
The Telegraph chairman was speaking as the UK group announced a Pounds 2.6m
operating loss for the third quarter, on turnover of Pounds 53.9m. The
period felt the full effects of the 18p cut in the price of the weekday
Daily Telegraph to 30p to compete against the 20p Times.
The pre-tax profit for the quarter, including interest payments, was Pounds
3.6m, compared with Pounds 10.6m last time.
Mr Stephen Grabiner, managing director of The Telegraph, said yesterday:
'When we made our price cut it was to defend our market position and to try
to grow our young readership. We have done both.'
Circulation had increased by between 90,000 and 100,000 to about 1.08m. The
company said that from April to September readership among 25 to 44
year-olds had increased by 29 per cent on the comparable period. The Times,
now selling more than 614,000, had increased its proportion of older
readers, Mr Grabiner added.
For the first nine months group turnover was Pounds 190.2m (Pounds 188.3m)
and pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 33.9m (Pounds 45.2m).
Earnings per share dropped from 22.5p to 17.7p.
The company said yesterday that the third quarter operating loss had been
caused by a redundancy programme.
Newspaper advertising revenue had increased by 12.5 per cent.
'Reasonable levels of operating profitability will be sustainable, even in a
prolonged period of low cover prices,' The Telegraph said. The outlook
remained 'quite positive' helped by support from overseas and associated
companies.
A stake in Carlton Television, the London weekday ITV company, was sold for
Pounds 10m, representing a capital gain of Pounds 6.6m which was not
included in the interim profits.
Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said yesterday he
had reduced his full-year forecast for The Telegraph by Pounds 4m to Pounds
43.5m.
The share price, which reached a high this year before the price cut of
625p, fell 5p to 337p yesterday.
