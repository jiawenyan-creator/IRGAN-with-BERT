FT  09 JUL 93 / Approval close on assisted areas
BRITAIN AND the European Commission are 'close to agreement' on proposals to
redraw the map of areas eligible for UK government assistance following
high-level talks in Brussels yesterday.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, met Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition
commissioner, to discuss the government's regional aid plans. Mr Sainsbury
presented a controversial draft map of British regional aid, which it is
understood would transfer some aid from the north-west of England, Wales and
Scotland towards the traditionally more prosperous south.
