FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (12): Volvo and Saab struggle on -
Upheavals in Scandinavia
The future direction of Swedish carmakers Volvo and Saab Automobile is
inextricably tied up with their respective volume car partners, Renault of
France and General Motors of the US. Both Volvo and Saab are battling to
staunch continuing heavy losses.
This summer, Saab Automobile will finally unveil a successor for its
venerable 15-year-old 900 series, a car whose origins even date back a
decade earlier to 1968.
The car will be the first fruit of the new model programme that has been
under development since General Motors of the US took over control of the
ailing Saab car business at the end of 1989.
Volvo has also accepted that it is unlikely ever to develop a new car range
again alone. In one of the most far-reaching steps to date in the ambitious
alliance with Renault, the two companies have decided to develop jointly a
new range of top-of-the-line executive cars to be sold in Europe from the
end of the decade.
The two groups decided in the final months of last year to develop a common
platform for the new range, which would allow the use of many common
mechanical components, most importantly common engines and gearboxes.
While having a high degree of commonality 'under the skin' the cars will
have different body styles and will maintain independent Volvo and Renault
brand identities for sale through the two carmakers' separate distribution
networks. The director of the joint car project is from Volvo Car.
It is expected that the Renault version will replace its Renault Safrane
executive car, which was launched last year in Europe to replace the Renault
25. According to Renault, the new joint car range would also replace the
Volvo 850 which has been launched by the Swedish car maker during the past
18 months.
The joint Renault-Volvo car project is taking a similar approach to that
already used by the Peugeot group for its Peugeot and Citroen marques. Its
current top-of-the-range Citroen XM and Peugeot 605 cars share a common
platform, engines and gearboxes, but maintain very separate identities in
the market.
The joint car project marks a significant step forward for the two vehicle
makers, which have been developing a far-reaching alliance since September
1990. They were already co-operating in areas such as purchasing, quality,
research and marketing policies. Now, the two companies are seeking to use
their larger joint purchasing volumes in order to push down supply costs.
The aim is 'to control costs by reducing purchasing prices' with the target
of bringing the proportion of the two groups' total purchases from joint
outside suppliers to 80 per cent from only 20 per cent today.
Renault and Volvo have formed a Purchasing Economic Interest Grouping headed
by the French group's senior purchasing vice-president. Purchasing has been
a key area for the early development of a joint strategy. Outside purchases
of materials and components now account for about 60 per cent of the
production cost of vehicles, not including tooling costs.
Renault and Volvo's car and light commercial vehicle divisions made total
purchases of about FFr85bn in 1992.
They make purchases jointly for more than 30 families of products and
materials. Unified purchasing functions have been created for each set of
products, each headed by a Renault-Volvo executive purchaser. They issue
international calls for bids and assess the capacity of suppliers to meet
the product specifications of both groups.
Renault and Volvo Car have also formed an economic interest grouping for
quality, headed by Renault's senior vice-president for quality.
Overall, a common product plan has been finalised for the next 10-12 years
based on the principle of maintaining two distinct product lines and
separate identities for both brand names, but with common platforms and
components wherever possible.
The two companies have agreed on the common future use of engines, chassis,
gearboxes, axle assemblies and other components. Renault has been given
responsibility for developing diesel engines for the two groups and will
supply Volvo with its future diesel engine. This year, a version of Volvo's
latest petrol engine will be used to power a Renault vehicle.
Renault already supplies engines and gearboxes for the smaller Volvo 400
series which is built in the Netherlands by NedCar, the Volvo joint venture
with Mitsubishi Motors of Japan. In 1991, some 93,500 Renault engines and
82,000 gearboxes were supplied for the Volvo 400. Renault will also supply
engines and gearboxes for the successor vehicle to the Volvo 400 which is
now under development in a collaboration led by Mitsubishi and which will be
launched in 1995-96.
According to Renault, the cross-sourcing of engines with Volvo will involve
about 100,000 engines a year in each direction.
The commercial operations of the two groups are also being more closely
aligned around the world. In France, for example, the sales networks are
still kept separate but there is collaboration in areas such as distribution
of replacement parts, media buying and joint management of used-car
inventories.
Renault distributes Volvo cars in Argentina and Slovenia, while Volvo
distributes Renault cars in the Nordic countries, Australia, Malaysia and
Thailand.
The development of the Renault-Volvo alliance towards a full merger had
marked time in the run-up to last month's French elections, but it is now
expected to gather pace. Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault chairman and chief
executive, is keen to keep up the speed of collaboration with Volvo,
whatever pace is set by his shareholders.
'If you stop moving it is bad, you must keep up the momentum. The advantage
of a complete merger is simplicity and speed. Agreement between two
companies does not go as fast as managing a single group. I have a strong
priority to strengthen the links as fast as I can,' Mr Schweitzer said in an
interview last year.
At present, Renault owns a 25 per cent stake in the Volvo car operations, a
45 per cent stake in the Volvo truck and bus operations, and a stake of
close to 10 per cent in the Volvo parent company. Volvo holds a 20 per cent
stake in the Renault parent company, which includes the Renault car and
light commercial vehicle operations, and a 45 per cent stake in the Renault
truck and bus subsidiary.
While Renault and Volvo have different shareholders there will always remain
the basic thorny problem of how savings and profits - or losses  - are to be
apportioned between the two companies. Mr Schweitzer says, however, that 'it
is clear there is no way back. A single command structure would help make
things go faster.'
The influence in the alliance has inevitably shifted towards Renault as its
finances have strengthened and Volvo's financial performance has weakened.
In 1992, Volvo ran up an operating loss of SKr2.25bn following an operating
loss of SKr1.17bn in 1991. It is being forced to reduce its car assembly
capacity to cut the losses with closure of its two smaller Swedish assembly
plants, Uddevalla this spring and Kalmar in mid-1994. Uddevalla only started
production in 1987.
Including these closures, the group is cutting another 4,500 jobs, or 10 per
cent of the overall group workforce including commercial vehicles and marine
engines, by 1995. More than 11,000 employees, including consultants, have
been cut from the Volvo group workforce since mid-1990, with 3,900 leaving
during 1992.
It is also finally acting to simplify its product range. It stopped
production of the Volvo 740 during 1992 and is finally dropping the
venerable Volvo 240 this spring.
Volvo car sales have fallen from 405,600 in 1989 to 359,600 in 1990, then
309,300 in 1991 and 303,800 last year. The car operations have been in loss
since 1990 and suffered an operating loss of SKr1.828bn last year after an
operating loss of SKr1.776bn in 1991 and SKr855m in 1990.
The financial performance of the rival Saab car operations in Sweden has
been equally devastating and the GM-led management is still struggling to
staunch the losses.
Saab Automobile, which is owned 50 per cent by General Motors and 50 per
cent by Saab-Scania with GM holding management control, is forecasting a
'substantial improvement' in its results for 1993, but only after very heavy
losses over the past four years.
The two shareholders are having to pump in a further SKr2.8bn in new funds
this year to shore up Saab Automobile's battered balance sheet.
The company's loss, after financial items, rose again last year to
SKr2.688bn from a loss of SKr2.242bn in 1991 and SKr3.25bn in 1990. In 1989,
the Saab car division of Saab-Scania - before the GM rescue - made a loss of
SKr2.13bn following a marginal profit of SKr11m in 1988. Car sales have
fallen from 109,483 in 1989 to 93,224 in 1990, some 87,500 in 1991 and
86,800 last year.
The company was forced to launch another retrenchment programme late last
year with the aim of reducing costs by SKr2bn a year and eliminating another
1,980 jobs, mainly from the parent company in Sweden, which employed close
to 9,200 at the end of last year. The Saab car group had a workforce of
16,795 at the end of 1989.
Productivity of 57 hours per car at the main Trollhattan plant is supposed
to be improved to 45 hours per car by the end of 1993 and to 40 hours by
mid-1994. Saab has made savings of about SKr1bn on the costs of purchased
materials in the two years 1991-92, but it is now seeking to cut purchased
materials costs by another SKr1bn in 1993-94.
As part of the cost-saving campaign, the co-operation between Saab and GM is
being intensified and Saab is seeking to carry out development work on a
contract basis for GM. The two companies are also establishing a two-way
flow of components with Saab due to begin in 1993 supplying up to 65,000
gearboxes a year to GM Europe's Opel-Vauxhall operations, while it will take
supplies of GM's V6 engine from Vauxhall's new Pounds 193m engine plant at
Ellesmere Port in the UK.
The wait for a new product range at Saab has been long and wearying and the
Saab 900 replacement due this summer - it has been derived in part from the
Opel Vectra-Vauxhall Cavalier - can hardly come soon enough to try to revive
its battered fortunes.
