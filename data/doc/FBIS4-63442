  [Text] Tbilisi, 23 May (IBERIA) -- A so-called 
constitutional commission of Abkhazia has completed its work on 
Abkhazia's new constitution. It stipulates that Abkhazia is a 
sovereign state founding its relations with Georgia on 
agreements based on equality. Separatists intend to have the 
constitution adopted at a referendum held after Georgian 
refugees return to the Abkhazian region.
