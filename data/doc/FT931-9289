FT  15 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Buthelezi's role
THE power-sharing proposals agreed by the South Africa government and the
African National Congress (ANC) are a victory for pragmatism.
The time is now ripe for Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, to join
President FW de Klerk and invite the World Bank and other donors to support
health, education and housing programmes to help redress the apartheid
legacy. The sooner efforts get under way to meet the aspirations of black
South Africans, the better prospects for a new administration.
But first it is imperative that the proposals encompass Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader. There are many hurdles to be overcome, such
as: how will executive decisions in a multi-party administration be reached;
the composition of the security forces and who will be in control; what
powers will devolve to regions; and what happens when the five-year
agreement ends. But none is as formidable as that which would be presented
by an alienated Zulu leader.
His denunciation of the agreement over the weekend augurs ill. Thousands
have died in the feud between Inkatha and the ANC during the past three
years. His warning of possible bloodshed if the government and the ANC tried
to impose their plans is chilling.
Elections for a constituent assembly, envisaged under the proposals, will
almost certainly provoke further violence unless Inkatha participates.
However exasperated ANC and government negotiators may be by Chief
Buthelezi's role as a 'spoiler' in the talks so far -  he pulled out of
talks last September, and then published a constitution for Natal province
which would amount to a unilateral declaration of independence  - they must
not lose sight of the fact that his participation is essential.
They are inclined to threaten that unless he 'sees sense', they will rule
South Africa without him. Nothing could be more dangerous.
