FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Receivership for Betta Stores
BETTA STORES, the privately-owned Hampshire-based grocery chain, has gone
into receivership just two years after it was formed through the purchase of
51 stores from Budgens. About 850 jobs are at risk.
The company, which currently runs 47 neighbourhood stores in southern
England, said there was a 'combination of reasons' for its collapse but
blamed the recession as the biggest contributory factor.
In March 1990, Betta Stores, headed by Mr Tony Sanderson, a former chief
executive of Circle K, paid Budgens Pounds 10.5m in cash and Pounds 2m in
stock in consideration for the stores. But Budgens provided a secured
subordinated Pounds 2m loan to Betta Stores - repayable by 1994 - and struck
a two-year supply deal with the company.
