FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Sparbank up 21% in spite of
credit losses
SPARBANK, the Swedish savings bank, boosted profits by 21 per cent last year
to SKr1.03bn in spite of SKr1.11bn credit losses, writes Robert Taylor in
Stockholm.
At end-1991, the bank had Skr5.2bn of extended credit but said while this
was substantial, there was no risk to the bank because 'a large part was
covered by first class security'.
