  [Text] We have just received a report from the Croatian 
Assembly Secretariat that Stipe Mesic, president of the Chamber 
of Representatives, has decided to postpone the 18th session of 
the Chamber of Representatives, which was scheduled for tomorrow 
morning. In his brief statement Mesic says that his decision is 
motivated by the fact that at today's session of the House of 
Counties, Deputy Premier Vladimir Seks said that the government 
agrees with the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] proposal to 
withdraw draft legislation items on the proposed agenda of the 
House of Counties from the current procedure. Since this 
proposal also includes some legislation which should be first 
discussed by the House of Counties [words indistinct] he will 
call the next session of the Chamber of Representatives in 
writing.
