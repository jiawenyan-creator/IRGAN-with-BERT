  [Text] The Federation Council insists that it be given the 
right to appoint the chairman of the Constitutional Court. It 
moved this proposal, and many other amendments to the draft law 
on the Constitutional Court to the State Duma, Chairman of the 
State Duma Committee for Legislation and Judicial Reform 
Vladimir Isakov (the Agrarian Party) told INTERFAX. 
  He said that according to the draft law on the 
Constitutional 
Court, proposed by his committee and approved by the State Duma 
at first reading, the right to elect the chairman of the 
Constitutional Court is vested with the judges of the 
constitutional court. He also said that his committee would 
recommend that the State Duma turn down the amendments advanced 
by the Federation Council. 
  The State Duma will discuss the Federation Council's 
amendments on Friday in a block, he said. He also believes that 
the Federation Council's sudden initiative complicates the 
adoption of the law on the constitutional court by both chambers. 
  This law is to be adopted by two thirds of the votes, not by 
a simple majority, Isakov said. It will be very difficult to 
secure so many votes in the Federation Council, he added.
