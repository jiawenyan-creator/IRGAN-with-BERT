FT  09 JAN 92 / Institute of British Geographers' Conference in Swansea
Taking steps to lure shoppers: designers and operators of shopping centres
need to respond to the leisure interests of their customers if they want to
retain business, the conference was told.
Shoppers are bored with the 'functional' aspects of shopping and feel that
the pleasure element has been stripped out of it, said Mr Peter Newby of
Middlesex Polytechnic.
A survey of 24 shopping centres opened since 1988 found that all were
offering some form of entertainment, usually arranged by the manager of the
centre, to create a 'circus in the mall'. Nearly 90 per cent offered live
music and 72 per cent variety acts.
Mr Newby said Sunday trading provided special opportunities for centres to
create leisure activities and a 'carnival atmosphere'.
Centre managers needed to plan annual entertainment strategies and be given
training in how to provide entertainment, he said.
The developers in about a third of the centres had integrated leisure
facilities into the building plans to try and tempt customers to stay for
longer.
'Modern centres are predictable,' he said. 'They all contain the same
chains. People want variety and novelty. The major retailers were
complaining about trading volumes, but those in Camden market were not.'
Mr Newby said the design of modern centres emphasised functional
effectiveness, whereas leisure shopping lacked order and had 'texture'. This
needed to be reflected in new plans, which might recreate the medieval
street plan, with a variety of routes on offer.
