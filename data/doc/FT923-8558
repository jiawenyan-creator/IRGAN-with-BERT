FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: Chile poised to privatise
railway
CHILE'S loss-making state railway, one of the few companies that remains in
public ownership, is to be privatised. The sale of Empresa de Ferrocariles
del Estado (Efe) was given parliamentary approval last week.
Its cargo and passenger services will be put to public tender, while the
government will continue to own the network of stations and railway tracks.
Parliament also authorised the railway company to issue up to Dollars
75m-worth of government-guaranteed bonds to clear part of its Dollars 100m
debt. Another Dollars 75m bond issue will be earmarked to upgrade tracks and
rolling stock.
The government hopes an injection of private capital will help modernise
services after decades of neglect.
Most of Chile's 10,000 km of track has fallen into disuse. Passenger
services to the north of Santiago and between Chile and Argentina no longer
exist. In addition, the railways have lost most of their cargo business to
road transport.
Only the railway, water companies, the state lottery and Codelco, the
Chilean Copper Corporation, remain in state hands following the 1973-90
military government's sweeping programme of privatisations.
However, business leaders and conservative opposition parties are urging
President Patricio Aylwin's centre-left government to privatise Codelco, the
world's biggest copper producer.
