FT  23 APR 94 / ILO pushes labour standards clause
The introduction of fair labour standards into future international trade
agreements should be based on the fundamental principles of the
International Labour Organisation.
This was the main message from the ILO's director general, Mr Michel
Hansenne, in a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the ILO's
Declaration of Philadephia which set out the principles of the organisation.
He called for a 'multilateral approach' by governments, employers and
workers 'to improve respect for workers' rights and promote social progress
everywhere.'
Mr Hansenne said it would be 'tragic if the debate over social clauses in
trade agreements should degenerate into acrimonious allegations of social
dumping from one side and disguised protectionism from the other.' He added
that many countries had already adopted ILO human rights conventions.
