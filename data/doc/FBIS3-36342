  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 03, BNS -- The CSCE mission to Estonia 
denied the accusations that its reports misinform the world 
community about the situation in Estonia. 
  The Estonian Human Rights Institute accused the mission last 
Monday [31 January] of using premises that contradict 
international law and inaccurate data as the basis of its 
official reports. 
  The Institute based its accusations among other things on 
the 
mission's activity report No.46 of Jan. 10, which is based on 
the point of view that the Estonian state came into being after 
the Soviet Union disintegrated and thus fails to recognize the 
state's continuity. As a result, the responsibility for 
citizens of the former Soviet Union, who immigrated into Estonia 
during the occupation period, is laid on Estonia. 
  The CSCE mission to Estonia in a statement released on 
Thursday in Tallinn says that the No. 46 report of the mission 
"says nothing of the kind". 
  "The mission supports the Estonian Government's freedom to 
determine the requirements for Estonian citizenship and makes a 
clear distinction between the status of the Baltic states and 
that of the CIS," the mission writes. 
  In its' Thursday's statement the mission notes that the No. 
46 report "favoured prompt implementation of Estonian's law on 
aliens and supported the right of all persons, regardless of 
nationality, to leave the country legally". 
  The mission also states, that the Russian affairs are 
outside 
of its mandate, since the mission is authorized to examine only 
the situation in Estonia. The Estonian Human Rights Institute 
said on Monday that the CSCE mission "failed to take notice" of 
the human rights' violations in CIS and "the aggressive 
nationalism" of Russia.
