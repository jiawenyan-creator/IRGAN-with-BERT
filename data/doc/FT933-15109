FT  10 JUL 93 / Letter: Cause of low-grade jobs
Sir, Richard Seager suggests (Letters, July 1) that labour market
flexibility in the US has reduced unemployment but has also led to low grade
jobs, and that Europe should be wary of this flexibility.
I am baffled as to how labour market flexibility in itself stops an employer
creating a high grade job. The truth is that such flexibility merely reduces
unemployment, and that is all its advocates claim for it.
As to the real wage or 'grade' of work done, this is determined by a range
of factors such as technical competence - where the US has lost much of its
lead to Japan. Another factor is terms of trade, where the US has also lost
out. It is the deterioration of these factors, not labour market
flexibility, that explains the US's relative decline.
