  [Text] Chisinau January 21 TASS -- Moldovan Premier Andrei 
Sangheli said on Friday that an economic union, now being 
created by the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), should 
become an alternative to the European Union [EU] in future. 
  According to the prime minister, Moldova has always favoured 
an economic union of the Commonwealth countries, since neither 
Russia, nor Ukraine, nor still Moldova can compete with the 
European Economic Community single-handed. 
  The European Union countries want the former Soviet 
republics 
to form their own economic space, their market and their 
production, Sangeli said, stressing that the eastern market is 
responsible for the lion's share of the Moldovan export. 
  The prime minister called the industrial slump the main 
difficulty in carrying out economic reforms in Moldova. "If our 
economy had accomplished the 1990 results, it would be easier to 
carry out reforms," he said. "When we carry out good reforms, 
but living standards drop, people will not understand such a 
government."
