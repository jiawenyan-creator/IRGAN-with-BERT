ON THE COVER 
Turning yesterday's headlines into today's docudramas, NBC and ABC bring a pair 
of fact-based stories to the small screen this week. 
NBC presents "Drug Wars: The Camarena Story," a three-part miniseries about the 
death of Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique (Kiki) Camarena airing 
from 9 to 11 p.m. Sunday through Tuesday on Channels 4, 36 and 39. 
"Drug Wars" tells of Camarena (played by Steven Bauer), who in 1985 was 
tortured for information and murdered by the drug lords he was investigating. 
Elizabeth Pena (on the cover with Bauer) co-stars as Camarena's wife. 
Competing against Part 2 of "Drug Wars" at 9 p.m. Monday (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 
42) is "Rock Hudson," an ABC biography focusing on the actor who died of AIDS 
in 1985. 
Thomas Ian Griffith portrays Hudson in the two-hour film. The supporting cast 
includes Andrew Robinson as Hudson's agent Henry Willson; Diane Ladd as his 
mother, Kay Fitzgerald, and William R. Moses as Marc Christian, the actor's 
companion during the last few years of his life.
