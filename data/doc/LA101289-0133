CENSORED ART 
House of Representatives leaders refused to display, among their colleagues, 
controversial "art work" funded by taxpayers before voting on (Rep. Dana) 
Rohrabacher's proposal to eliminate funding for such trash. Yet, these same 
lawmakers continue to scream censorship at those of us who feel this type of 
filth should not be sponsored and paid for by the government, i.e.: you and me, 
Joe Taxpayer. What hypocrisy!
