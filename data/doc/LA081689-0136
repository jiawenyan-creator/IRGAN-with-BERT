ANAHEIM PEDESTRIAN HIT, KILLED 
An Anaheim man who was attempting to cross a major thoroughfare in the middle 
of the block was killed Tuesday night when he was struck by a van, Anaheim 
police said. 
Scott Michael Gore, 24, was pronounced dead at Humana Hospital in West Anaheim 
from injuries suffered in the 10:16 p.m. accident, Sgt. Ronald Lovejoy said. 
Lovejoy said Gore tried to cross Beach Boulevard just north of Lincoln 
Boulevard when he was hit by a van driven by Michael Christian, 17, of Garden 
Grove. 
"He apparently ran in front of the vehicle driven by Mr. Christian," Lovejoy 
said. "(Gore) wasn't in a crosswalk." 
Christian was not charged in the accident.
