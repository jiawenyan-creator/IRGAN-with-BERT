FT  21 APR 93 / Subscriber list ruled depreciable asset
THE US Supreme Court has ruled that a newspaper's list of subscribers may be
treated as a depreciable intangible asset, in a decision that could cost the
federal government billions of dollars in tax revenues.
In a 5:4 decision announced yesterday, the court ruled that the Newark
Morning Ledger, a New Jersey newspaper, could depreciate the Dollars 67m
attributed to subscriber lists in the Dollars 314m it paid to buy another
newspaper, and thus claim tax deductions.
The US Internal Revenue Service had argued that the subscriber lists were
part of the company's goodwill, with no easy valuation, and could not be
depreciated for tax purposes under federal law.
However, Justice Harry Blackmun, writing the Supreme Court's majority
opinion, said that the Morning Ledger had successfully argued that paid
subscribers constituted 'an intangible asset with an ascertainable value and
a limited useful life, the duration of which can be ascertained with
reasonable accuracy.'
The case has potential repercussions for other acquisitions, especially in
the financial services sector, where insurance companies and banks have
argued with the IRS over whether lists of customers were a depreciable
asset.
About Dollars 10.5bn of such assets are estimated to be in dispute at the
moment.
The Morning Ledger had won its original suit in a lower federal court, but
that ruling was overturned last year by an appeals court in Philadelphia,
which took the view that subscribers could stop buying newspapers at any
time, and so the value of the subscribers' list was uncertain.
Federal courts in other parts of the country, however, had produced
conflicting rulings, making it important for the Supreme Court to lay down a
uniform standard.
