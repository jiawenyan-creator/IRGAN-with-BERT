FT  18 AUG 93 / Singapore starts telecom sell-off
THE SINGAPORE government has announced details of the partial privatisation
of Singapore Telecom (ST), the state-owned telecommunications and postal
service.
Mr Mah Bow Tan, the Singapore communications minister, said the government
planned to float an initial 6 to 8 per cent of ST in October, with about
half the first offering of shares being available through tender and open to
foreign investors, and the rest allocated to Singapore citizens.
ST is one of Singapore's most successful and cash rich companies and the
flotation of the company has been billed as the largest single privatisation
so far in South-East Asia.
However there was some surprise among Singapore's financial community that a
greater share of the company would not be available in the initial offering.
Mr Mah said a second public offering would be made within three years and
eventually the government planned to sell off up to 25 per cent of ST.
'The government is being ultra cautious on this one,' said one broker. 'ST
is a prime state asset. The government is determined to make sure nothing
goes wrong.'
When floated, it is estimated that ST will be worth between Dollars S15bn
and Dollars S20bn (Pounds 6.36bn-Pounds 8.48bn).
The Singapore government is making efforts to increase public share
ownership and has offered a number of incentives to people to buy ST shares.
Participants in Singapore's Central Provident Fund, a compulsory savings
scheme, will be able to buy quantities of ST shares at a 45 per cent
discount. There will also be bonus issues for those who hold on to their
shares for an extended period.
