FT  08 MAR 94 / Lib Dems repeat education pledge
The Liberal Democrats yesterday launched their education policy for the
local and European elections with a repeat of their general election promise
to boost education spending by adding a percentage point to income tax.
Mr Don Foster, education spokesman, said that Pounds 500m would be spent on
capital spending and building repairs, while priorities for other spending
would be nursery education, children with special needs, grants for further
and adult education, and cash aid for students.
