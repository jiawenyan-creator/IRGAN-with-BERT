FT  14 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Political ploys
Sir, Returning from Florence, I was able to peruse Haig Simonian's report
('Inquiry stokes Italian political fires', January 10) on the latest in
Italian politics, over which my friends there had been shaking their heads
in apology for 'un momento delicato per l'Italia'.
Sensing they felt Italy was showing badly in comparison with Britain, I
reassured them. Taking Iraqgate as the most recent example, I explained
that, whereas their politicians went in for flagrant illegality, the
approach of ours was merely more hypocritical - a British characteristic
they immediately recognised. Rather than flout an inconvenient law,
Britain's politicos change - or at least bend - it.
