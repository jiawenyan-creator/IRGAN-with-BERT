  [Text] The Navegacion Caribe Enterprise of the Isle of 
Youth will this year seek new lines of work aimed at ending 
subsidies and becoming profitable. This was announced at the 
enterprise's annual assessment meeting. To achieve this, the 
enterprise will increase ship-repair services at tourist hubs in 
Cayo Largo del Sur and the Colony Hotel, and will charge for any 
type of assistance to organizations and individuals. The 
participants in the assessment meeting discussed measures to 
ensure passenger transportation, which has been effected by the 
shortage of spare parts, primarily for Cometa hovercrafts. 
  Despite these shortages and additional ferry trips between 
Batabano and Nueva Gerona, over 1.3 million people were 
transported by this enterprise in 1993.
