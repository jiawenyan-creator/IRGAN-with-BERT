  [Text] Geneva, June 23 (BTA) -- The Deputy Prime Minister 
and Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Evgeni Matinchev met 
with the Director General of the International Organization for 
Migration [IOM], Mr. James Purcell, in Geneva and told him about 
the problems Bulgaria's Government is facing with migration: 
continuing economic emigration, migration of ethnic Turks, a 
large flow of passing migrants heading towards Western Europe, 
the presence of some 30-50 000 illegal aliens in Bulgaria and 
the ensuing problems in the labour market and occasional 
outbursts of xenophobia. 
  He said Bulgaria was hoping for IOM help to carry out the 
reform in migration legislation, to establish a computerized 
information system to follow the migration flow across the 
border checkpoints and to help ethnic Turks returning from 
Turkey and Bulgarians from Ukraine and Moldova who have moved to 
Bulgaria to become an integral part of Bulgarian society. 
  Mr. James Purcell said that IOM was willing to help Bulgaria 
solve its migration-related problems, reads a fax message of the 
Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs received at BTA.
