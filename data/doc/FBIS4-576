  [Text] The Lusaka peace talks could resume today, after a 
break of slightly more than one week caused by UN Special 
Representative Alioune Blondin Beye's trip to Geneva to hold 
talks with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. In fact, 
some people believe that the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] will adopt a more flexible stand 
to facilitate the proceedings. Alves Antonio, our correspondent 
in the Zambian capital, reports: 
  [Begin Antonio recording] The Lusaka peace talks could 
resume 
today. This could be a decisive day for the resumption of 
government-UNITA talks in the Zambian capital. Reliable and 
generally well-placed sources have also admitted the possibility 
that a plenary meeting attended by the troika of observers and 
the negotiators will take place today. Some points still need 
to be discussed, notably national reconciliation and the 
conclusion of the second round of presidential elections. 
  The UNITA team remains reluctant about certain points, but 
it 
has continued to come under pressure and it seems likely to show 
some flexibility because it will have to accept its standing as 
a political party that lost the 1992 elections. The Angolan 
peace talks continue to attract much attention and something new 
could happen today. May it be for the good of the Angolan 
people, who need peace so they can work to ensure progress and 
development for their country. [end recording]
