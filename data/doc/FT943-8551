FT  17 AUG 94 / Air delays in prospect
European flights face increased delays after a two-year period of
improvement, the Association of European Airlines said yesterday. During the
first half of this year, just over 11 per cent of intra-European flights
were 15 minutes or more late - 'reasonably good' figures in the AEA's view
and down on the same period last year. 'The improvement was all in the first
quarter, however, with a steady deterioration since then,' it said. The
association's secretary-general, Mr Karl-Heinz Neumeister, said
infrastructure deficiencies at airports and in air traffic control systems
caused 62 per cent of delays in June. 'The build-up of demand in summer
months is not a new phenomenon. The airlines cope with it. The tourism
industry copes with it. We lay on capacity appropriate to the demands of the
market. The infrastructure providers, all too evidently, do not,' he said.
