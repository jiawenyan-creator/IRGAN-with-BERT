FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Deckel Maho sees benefits in
three years
THE first fruits of the merger of German machine tool makers Friedrich
Deckel and Maho are expected in three years when the slimmed-down company
should return to profit.
According to Mr Bodo Viets, Maho chairman, a loss of DM100m (Dollars 62.5m)
is expected in the first year, and the first two years' results will be
burdened by restructuring costs totalling DM240m. These will include charges
for closures, removals and the cost of reducing the workforce.
However, cost savings worth DM120m a year will have a beneficial effect from
1995 onwards, according to a merger report published yesterday. The new
company, to be called Deckel Maho, expects turnover in the year to June 30
1994 of between DM400m and DM500m with the workforce cut to about 1,500
people.
The figures suggest heavy capacity cuts, which have not yet been decided.
Last year's combined sales came to DM750m with a workforce of more than
3,000 people down from almost 6,000 in 1989-90.
The merger of two of Germany's best-known and most troubled machine tool
makers was engineered by banks, led by Deutsche Bank, which have a
controlling stake in Maho. Mr Rolf Breuer, a senior Deutsche Bank director,
was recently appointed chairman of the Maho supervisory board. The new
company will be majority-owned by Walter Eder, an engineering group which
controls Deckel.
Prime aim of the deal is to construct a group with the necessary critical
mass and a strong home base from which it can hope to fight off the
Japanese, Germany's main international competitors. Deckel and Maho have
between them up to 40 per cent of the German market in boring and milling
machines.
The deal indirectly involves Gildemeister, a leading operator in the sector,
which last January founded a joint distribution company with Deckel.
