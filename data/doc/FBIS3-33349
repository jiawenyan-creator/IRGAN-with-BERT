<F P=106> [Interview with former President Raul Alfonsin by Analia </F>
Argento; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The former president maintains that Senator Fernando 
de la Rua is on the road to "political suicide," and that he 
will not be able to run "even for mayor." For the time being, in 
his view, only Angeloz is in a position to head the ticket in 
1995. He considers Angeloz a "progressive" who contradicts 
himself. The leader of the Radical Civic Union (UCR), in an 
exclusive interview with LA PRENSA, says he believes the 
inflation index announced by the Economy Ministry. He 
acknowledged that memories of hyperinflation weigh heavily on 
the Radicals, and that "some people believe we want Menem to be 
reelected," but "we will vote for our own candidate." 
  Perhaps because throughout their history, the Radicals have 
suffered the consequences of personality cults and 
antipersonality cults, former President Raul Alfonsin does not 
mention by name the targets of his harshest criticism. When he 
met with LA PRENSA, the mere mention of Senator Fernando de la 
Rua was enough to get him riled. 
  [Argento] How concerned are you about De la Rua's decision 
not to support the constitutional reform? 
  [Alfonsin] I think it is a truly serious problem for the 
Radicals. This amounts to an incredible insubordination. I know 
of no precedent for anything like this. The delegates from the 
federal capital went to the convention in Santa Rosa, they 
discussed their positions, they voted, and they lost. Now they 
are refusing to accept the resolution that was passed there. 
This is a very divisive attitude that has no place in any 
political organization. If everyone in the provinces decided to 
do the same thing, the Radical Civic Union would be gone within 
a year. So it makes no sense to be doing this; it is the product 
of an attitude that is absolutely unacceptable in any 
people-oriented organization. What we are witnessing is the 
political suicide of Fernando de la Rua, no doubt about it. 
  [Argento] Why suicide? 
  [Alfonsin] Well, because he will have to run in an election, 
win an election in which no one knows what will happen, and then 
face an election in the worst possible position, worse even than 
the way he went into the last election, thanks to his ineptitude. 
  [Argento] De la Rua says that the party members in the 
capital oppose reelection. 
  [Alfonsin] What has that got to do with anything? We will 
see 
which slate wins the internal elections. The party has its 
structure, its organization; the members in the capital elected 
delegates, who went to the National Convention, and the other 
provinces had a different opinion that prevailed. That is 
democracy; anything else is a parody of democracy. 
  [Argento] Might there be sanctions? 
  [Alfonsin] I will let the episode run its course, and then 
we 
will see. But no one here is going to play at breaking up what 
the capital really wants. 
  [Argento] How can it be that you were able to engage in 
dialogue with President Carlos Menem, but you cannot reach an 
agreement with one of your fellow party members? 
  [Alfonsin] And...if dialogue is possible with those who are 
different, surely it is much more difficult because we are more 
alike (maybe). Those of us who abide by the same philosophy must 
be much more careful with each other. I am willing to talk; I 
will not refuse to talk to anyone. I am the chairman of the 
national committee and I am willing to talk, but I am also ready 
to enforce the resolutions passed by the party. 
  [Argento] Why do you think De la Rua adopted this attitude? 
  [Alfonsin] You would have to ask him that question. This is 
an unprecedented situation in the UCR. In 1957, the party split 
in two because a certain resolution passed by the National 
Convention was not accepted. But within the party, nothing like 
this has ever been seen. 
  [Argento] Is there a chance of a schism? 
  [Alfonsin] No, I hope that, at least on this, he does not 
continue forward. He should see how people from all the 
provinces come up to me and say, "What is happening, how is it 
possible for this man to conspire against the possibilities for 
a Radical victory?" Not only in the capital, but in the country, 
because the statements he has made in the dailies of Buenos 
Aires, or on the radio or on television, are seen in all 
provinces of Argentina. 
  [Argento] When you ran for the presidency of the party, you 
said you were going to make the UCR's discourse more uniform. 
You seem to be having a tough time doing that. 
  [Alfonsin] Yes, I think it will be tough, but give me time. 
  [Argento] What makes you trust the ruling party now, when a 
year ago you were saying that this government "is tyrannical and 
is putting the squeeze on the governors"? 
  [Alfonsin] We have turned to the reform precisely because it 
is a means of preventing any tyrannical inclination or 
authoritarian streak, of attenuating the powers of the 
president, achieving greater legal security, making republican 
controls more effective so as to prevent corruption, achieving 
more federalism, and all that. We trust them because the law is 
structured in such a way that everything we want is voted on at 
the same time as the issue of reelection because some people 
think we want reelection. We do not want it; we will vote 
against the president. We will have our own candidate. 
  [Argento] Are you making that clarification because of the 
insistent rumors about a joint ticket between the Justicialist 
Party (PJ) and the UCR? 
  [Alfonsin] No, because we conducted a survey in which we 
came 
out better than we expected in voting intentions in Greater 
Buenos Aires, but it is very bad that people do not understand 
this. And it is only natural, because this does not take 
people's needs into account. The primary obligation of 
politicians is to explain what this reform is all about. Some 
people were saying they thought we were supporting the president 
on reelection. 
  [Argento] What will you do to change that impression? 
  [Alfonsin] In general, people in Greater Buenos Aires (who 
may not be well informed because they have other concerns) 
thought differently. So we need to clarify the situation. The 
first campaign we need to launch is to explain what it is all 
about. 
  [Argento] Speaking of things you have in common with the 
government, there is also talk that Cesar Jaroslavsky could be 
Menem's cabinet chief. 
  [Alfonsin] No, that is a lie. We will not allow him to. 
  [Argento] Since the pact, some people have been thinking: 
What is the difference between Menem and Alfonsin? 
  [Alfonsin] No, that is a captious question. I defy you to 
find a political party that has been as firm in its statements 
of opposition as we have been since the pact was signed. 
  [Argento] As the first candidate for the constituent 
assembly, what will you do to defeat Governor Eduardo Duhalde? 
  [Alfonsin] We will defeat him because people may criticize 
us 
for the economy, for example. Stability is not at issue here. 
They also criticize us for other things, but when people want to 
safeguard their freedom, their dignity, and their national 
institutions, they think of the Radicals. I think they also feel 
that I did a good job in consolidating democracy, regardless of 
other errors and misjudgments. Just as we consolidated democracy 
then, now what we want to do is draft a better constitution. 
  [Argento] Is there any chance of reaching an agreement with 
the government on other issues, such as labor reform? 
  [Alfonsin] They would have to change a lot of things, 
because 
the way it is now, it is unconstitutional, in my opinion. 
<H5>  Hyperinflation </H5>
  [Argento] Your internal adversaries attributed the 3 October 
defeat to the "specter of hyperinflation" in your government. 
  [Alfonsin] That may be, of course. The business of 
hyperinflation was very harmful. But the economic problem is not 
at issue here. 
  [Argento] And in 1995? 
  [Alfonsin] Since I will not be a candidate in 1995, there 
will be no problem. 
  [Argento] But what if your party loses again? They could 
blame you again. 
  [Alfonsin] Let them keep on saying it, even if I have 
changed, they will remember, even if I die, they will remember 
it just the same. 
  [Argento] The inflation rate in January was just 0.1 
percent. 
What do you think? 
  [Alfonsin] I think it is the result of a great depression in 
demand, and that is not consistent. Of course, we favor 
stability; it can be no other way. But if you depress demand, 
there can be no inflation. And with real wages falling and 
unemployment rising, demand is obviously depressed. 
  [Argento] Do you believe the figures released by the 
Ministry 
of Economy? 
  [Alfonsin] Yes, in general I do. With the proviso, though, 
that there are figures for the more affluent and figures for the 
less affluent, and the one for the less affluent is always a 
point or so higher. 
  [Argento] Why do you usually aim your criticism at Cavallo 
and not Menem, if the minister says that the economic plan is 
the president's? 
  [Alfonsin] My criticism has never been personal, never in my 
life. I got angry with you once because you portrayed me as 
fighting with the president and you criticized me for that. Now 
people criticize me for not criticizing him. I have always 
questioned government policies, and the ones I disagree with the 
most are the social policies they advocate, and the idea of 
making the most disadvantaged sectors bear the brunt of the 
crisis. And fundamentally, the liquidation of all the regional 
economies, which I had always warned about. 
  [Argento] What will be the outcome of that situation? 
  [Alfonsin] I think serious measures have to be taken. We are 
going to hold a seminar to which we will invite the most diverse 
business and labor sectors, to study the issue. We will hold it 
in Viedma. 
  [Argento] Is that not a wink at Massaccesi? 
  [Alfonsin] No, no, it is a pleasure for us to go to the 
place 
that someday will be the capital of the Argentine nation. 
  [Argento] Are you persisting with that plan? It was very 
expensive. 
  [Alfonsin] Expensive? Nonsense, that is just one of those 
stories people tell. Houses need to be built everywhere, and you 
build houses where the people are. If people go from one place 
to another, they build schools and hospitals in the new place, 
just the same. 
  [Argento] Ministries and other public buildings would also 
have to be built. 
  [Alfonsin] And we paid for all those buildings and then some 
by selling the Japanese Embassy, $300 million at the exchange 
rate of the time. 
  [Argento] So if the Radicals were in power, you would 
continue that project? 
  [Alfonsin] I would, but since I am not going to be the 
candidate, I do not know what the new Radical president will do. 
<H5>  Presidential Timber </H5>
  [Argento] The next presidential candidate will have to have 
your support. To whom will you give your blessing? 
  [Alfonsin] Not mine, he will need that of the entire party. 
Whoever is the Radical candidate must enjoy the support of the 
party, but after the internal elections, I hope no province will 
get the idea of holding a plebiscite to decide whether or not 
they support him (he laughs)! 
  [Argento] Who will be the UCR's next presidential candidate? 
  [Alfonsin] I do not know. At present, I get the impression 
that Eduardo Angeloz is in the best position. But that is all, 
the best position. I do not know. 
  [Argento] Angeloz considers himself one of the most 
progressive leaders of the party, citing the health plan that he 
is implementing in Cordoba. Do you agree? 
  [Alfonsin] I think he is governing Cordoba in a progressive 
way, although sometimes I may disagree with some of his 
statements; they are not consistent with his progressive 
government. But after all, that is his business. 
  [Argento] What about De la Rua? 
  [Alfonsin] De la Rua is committing political suicide. He 
will 
not even be able to run for mayor of Buenos Aires. De la Rua has 
destroyed himself with these positions. 
  [Argento] When will you retire from politics? 
  [Alfonsin] We shall see. I have been told that I cannot say 
when.

<H5>  "War" of Signatures Launched </H5>
  At this point, no one will venture to guess the final 
outcome 
of the crisis in the Radical Party in the capital, where the De 
la Rua and Alfonsin camps have grown further apart. While some 
people (just a few) advocated a compromise, the election 
campaign was practically launched yesterday. 
  Two days after the antireform camp of Fernando de la Rua was 
thwarted in its attempt to call a referendum, De la Rua and 
Alfonsin followers went out yesterday to walk the precincts and 
collect signatures to support their respective positions. 
  Thus, De la Rua walked the streets of Flores while his 
followers urged people to sign up to support the referendum on 
the reform. Ballot boxes were set up at tables located on the 
busiest corners so that citizens could express their opinions on 
the reform that was agreed to. 
  At the same time, the Alfonsin supporters of the Ateneo del 
Centenario, headed by Jesus Rodriguez, hit the pavement to begin 
collecting signatures to call for a referendum to determine the 
membership's opinion of the agreement forged by the De la Rua 
camp and the Buenos Aires PJ to allow former Senator Juan Trilla 
to chair the Deliberative Council, in response to their 
adversaries' initiative. 
  The charter of the UCR in the federal capital states that a 
referendum may be held if two-thirds of the total number of 
delegates or of the Metropolitan Convention vote in favor of it, 
or if 10 percent of the party members in the district sign 
petitions calling for one. At present, that means that about 
22,000 signatures must be gathered. 
  The strategy of the De la Rua supporters, who are in the 
majority in Buenos Aires, is to place a question about support 
for the reform on the ballot to elect delegates to the 
constituent assembly on 20 February. If more than 10 percent of 
the votes cast oppose the reform, the results will be binding, 
and the national convention's decision to support the agreement 
will be overturned. 
  De la Rua contended that "we are getting off to a good start 
in this campaign, because we see that people are asking for our 
help to make the UCR a true opposition party. They want to have 
a chance to express their opinions on the matter." The Buenos 
Aires senator demanded that the head of the party, Raul 
Alfonsin, "respect the opinion of the members of the Radical 
Civic Union in the federal capital, whom we want to represent." 
<H5>  Corrientes </H5>
  Meanwhile, in Corrientes, the Radical Integration Line, 
headed by Deputy Nestor Lino Golpe, decided to run its own 
candidates in the internal elections to make up the list of 
delegates to the constituent assembly. They stated that they 
would oppose the Olivos Pact, signed by President Carlos Menem 
and Radical leader Raul Alfonsin.
