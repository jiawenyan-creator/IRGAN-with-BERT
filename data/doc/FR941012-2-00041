<DOCTITLE>Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>


October 5, 1994.


Take notice that on September 29, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural), 701 East 22nd Street, Lombard,
Illinois, 60148, filed in Docket No. CP94817000 an application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural
Gas Act, requesting authorization to construct and operate 2.86 miles of 36 inch loop line in Effingham County, Illinois,
to accommodate an additional 32 Mmcf per day of gas from Natural's Loudon Storage Field to the Chicago market area,
all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.
Natural states that this proposal will result in the No. 3 line of Natural's Gulf Coast Mainline extending from the
immediate outlet of Natural's Loudon Storage Field northward toward the Chicago market area. It is further stated
that this additional loop will benefit Natural's system by improving the utilization of the existing certificated
peak daily deliverability at Loudon.
It is estimated that the facilities for this project will cost approximately $2.83 million, which Natural proposes
to finance with funds on hand.
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before October
26, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and
procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene
is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of
such hearing will be duly given.
Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Natural to appear or
be represented at the hearing.
