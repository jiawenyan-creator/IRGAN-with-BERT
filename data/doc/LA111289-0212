FOR THE RECORD 
Coastal Commission -- Because of an editing error, an article on illegal 
coastal development in Opinion on Nov. 5 misstated the area covered by 
enforcement officers for the California Coastal Commission. The ratio is one 
full-time enforcement officer for each 457,000 acres of land; there is a total 
of 1.6 million acres of land in the coastal zone.
