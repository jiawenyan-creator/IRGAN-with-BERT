FT  22 FEB 93 / No shortage in school governors
THE government's policy of giving greater power to school governors has been
boosted by a survey which shows no shortage of people standing for election
as governors.
About half of the 300,000 governors' posts were up for election last year
and the education department says that about half those whose terms ended
stood for re-election. In spite of fears of a shortage of candidates, most
of the 75,000 other vacancies were also filled.
