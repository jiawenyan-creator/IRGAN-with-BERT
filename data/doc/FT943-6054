FT  01 SEP 94 / Doubts over Scharping pledge
Most Germans do not believe a campaign pledge by the opposition leader, Mr
Rudolf Scharping, to reject any pact with ex-communists after the October 16
general election, an opinion poll released yesterday showed. The poll, by
the Allensbach Institute, indicated that 54 per cent of those surveyed said
Mr Scharping, leader of the Social Democrats (SPD), would accept the support
of ex-communists if it was needed to become chancellor. Twenty-five per cent
said they believed Mr Scharping, who insists he would reject any backing
from the ex-communists when a new parliament convenes. The remaining 21 per
cent were undecided, according to the poll, published in the Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung. Even among SPD members, only 40 per cent believed Mr
Scharping, while 38 per cent doubted his word and 22 per cent did not answer
either way. The issue has dominated campaigning since the SPD in the eastern
state of Saxony-Anhalt last month formed a minority state government based
on tacit toleration from the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor to
East Germany's ruling Communist party.
