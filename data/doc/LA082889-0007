A fight involving inmates from the East and West coasts at Lompoc Federal 
Penitentiary apparently was triggered by two feuding prisoners who organized 
the groups against each other, officials said. The prison yard fight Friday 
night involved about 40 to 50 inmates and lasted less than a half hour before 
it was broken up by guards, said Paul Ortiz, executive assistant to the warden. 
A "lock-down," in which each inmate is confined to his cell, remained in 
effect. "What we have found so far is that one inmate from the East and one 
from the West couldn't settle their own differences and it escalated," Ortiz 
said. One inmate was stabbed in the abdomen and suffered a broken skull in the 
fight and another suffered a broken jaw.
