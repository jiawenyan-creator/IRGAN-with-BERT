  [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Finnish Prime 
Minister Esko Aho concluded his official visit to China and left 
here by air for home this morning. 
  Prior to his departure Aho told a press conference that his 
trip will further enhance Finnish-Chinese ties, especially those 
in the economic and trade areas. 
  Finland and China have a long traditional friendship, and 
their ties have been developing over the past four decades, he 
said, adding that the two countries also enjoy frequent 
high-level contacts. 
  During the visit, leaders of the two countries "agreed to 
continue and enhance these contacts", he said. 
  On bilateral economic cooperation, Aho noted that Finland 
has 
unique advantages in forestry, wood-processing, paper-making and 
other traditional industries, and that the two countries 
cooperate in the energy, metallurgical industry, 
telecommunications and environmental protection fields. 
  There exists "great potential" for cooperation between 
Finland and China in economic, trade and other areas, he said. 
  The delegation noted a lot of opportunities for bilateral 
economic and trade cooperation, Aho said. 
  The Finnish businessmen in their prime minister's entourage 
held talks with their Chinese partners on specific projects and 
reached some cooperation agreements, Aho said. 
  He expressed the hope that the visit would have positive 
impact on this cooperation. 
  In addition, Aho said, the cultural exchange program signed 
here during the trip will help deepen the mutual understanding 
and friendship between the two peoples.
