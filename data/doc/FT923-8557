FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: Toronto bank to buy trust group
TORONTO Dominion Bank, Canada's fifth largest, will buy Central Guaranty
Trust from the troubled Central Capital financial services group.
Guaranty, the country's fourth largest trust company, was formerly the
centrepiece of Central Capital, the holding company of Mr Leonard Ellen, a
Montreal financier,
Central Capital piled up excessive debt in a two-year acquisition spree, and
was caught by the recession and the Canadian property crisis. Toronto
Dominion Bank will negotiate terms for taking over Guaranty, which has
CDollars 9bn (USDollars 7.6bn) of assets and 160 branches. It is also taking
over its deposit liabilities.
The bank defeated a joint offer by National Bank of Canada, Canada Trust and
Montreal Trust.
The deal has been approved by the Federal Central Deposit Insurance
Corporation and federal regulators. The bank aims to increase its market
share in Ontario and the Maritimes and step up its trust activities.
SNC Group, Canada's biggest engineering and construction group, says costs
will be cut further in the second half, in spite of growing international
business.
SNC, which specialises in energy, petrochemicals and metallurgical plant
engineering and construction management, earned CDollars 700,000 or 5 cents
a share in the first half, against CDollars 3.7m or 32 cents a share a year
earlier.
Revenues advanced to CDollars 319m from CDollars 219m. This increase came
mainly from the takeover of Lavalin, SNC's rival, last year.
The domestic market has been slowed by the recession and delays in
hydroelectric and other projects. Internationally, several big transport and
energy projects were also held up.
