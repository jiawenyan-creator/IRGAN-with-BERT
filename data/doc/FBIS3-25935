  [Text] In the provincial party school's auditorium 
yesterday morning, provincial party Secretary Wang Maolin made a 
guidance report on Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping to more than 600 cadets of the first stage of the 
provincial theoretical study class for prefectural- and 
departmental-level cadres, the training course for young and 
middle-aged cadres, the research class for party and government 
cadres, the special course for ethnic cadres, the cadres school, 
and the provincial Communist Youth League School. 
  In his report, Comrade Wang Maolin stressed the importance 
of 
studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, and the need to integrate theory with practice 
and strengthen leadership over theoretical study. 
  He said: Only by intensively studying Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, can we understand 
what socialism is and how to build socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, lay a solid ideological foundation for the 
establishment of a new socialist market economic structure and 
improve leaders' leadership mentality, their leadership level, 
and their ability to control the overall situation. 
  Comrade Wang Maolin pointed out: All-level party committees 
should put the study of Marxist theory in an important position 
and leading cadres at all levels should take the lead in 
studying theory. In the meantime, in theoretical study, there 
is a need to abide by the principle of being new and applicable 
and to further improve and observe all rules on theoretical 
study. In particular, theoretical propagation workers should 
conduct in-depth and painstaking research, write significant 
articles, and enthusiastically provide guidance lectures to 
deepen theoretical study. 
  Yang Zhengwu, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee; and Luo Haifan, member of the provincial party 
committee's Standing Committee and chief of the Organization 
Department, attended the meeting. Ying Sheng, president of the 
provincial party school, presided over the meeting.
