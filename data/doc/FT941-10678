FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Groupe GAN sees further gains
Groupe GAN, one of France's largest insurance groups, should report a
recovery in net profits to FFr700m (Dollars 119m) for 1993 from FFr402m in
1992 according to Mr Francois Heilbronner, chairman.
Mr Heilbronner said that GAN's net profits during the second half of 1993
had been 'of the same order' as the FFr372m it made in the first half,
thereby contributing to a 'significant increase' for the full financial
year.
GAN, scheduled for privatisation, is the smallest of France's big three
state-controlled insurers and has been the most vulnerable of the trio
during the recession. The group has been badly affected by the competitive
state of the insurance industry and from the problems of the property
sector.
However GAN, like the rest of the industry, did manage to stabilise
activities last year. Mr Heilbronner said the group was on course for
recovery in insurance, although further action was required at CIC, its
troubled banking network.
He forecast the recovery would continue in 1994 and gather momentum next
year. Mr Heilbronner's objective is for GAN to make net profits of FFr2bn in
1995.
