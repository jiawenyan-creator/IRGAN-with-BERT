FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Heron sells Sunderland shopping centre for
Pounds 39m
HERON International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property and trading group which is
hoping to gain creditors' approval of a Pounds 1.4bn refinancing plan next
Monday, has sold a shopping centre in Sunderland for Pounds 39m, to Land
Securities. The price was above the value assumed for the property in the
business plan.
Mr Ronson is expected to tell creditors at Monday's meeting that more than
another Pounds 100m of disposals have been lined up, also at prices above
book value, and ahead of schedule.
The success of the business plan depends on property values recovering. Mr
Ronson said the disposal 'is an indication of our ability to achieve
excellent values for creditors.' He added: 'I am confident that we will
improve upon the values at which the property portfolio has been assumed in
the business plan. The UK investment property market is showing the first
signs of recovery.'
The restructuring proposals have been approved by Heron's 82 banks but there
is some opposition from bondholders and other creditors.
The shopping centre, called The Bridges, comprises 80 units with annual
rents totalling Pounds 3.2m, giving an initial yield of over 8 per cent.
