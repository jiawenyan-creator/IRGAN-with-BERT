FT  17 JUL 93 / High coal stocks are criticised
BRITISH COAL has been unable to win new contracts because of the 'high
levels' of stocks held at power stations and improved performance of nuclear
energy, Mr Andrew Horsler, the corporation's marketing chief, said
yesterday.
Talks with the main power generators in England and Wales have not led to
extra sales in spite of a 'very competitive' offer, Mr Horsler said.
The high level of coal stocks were a key factor in the generators' decision
to buy just 40m tonnes from British Coal this year, falling to 30m tonnes in
each of the next four years.
