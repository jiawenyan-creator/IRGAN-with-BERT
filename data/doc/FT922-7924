FT  15 MAY 92 / Black markets prosper in Moscow
Roubles by the thousand change hands on a Moscow street as the capital's
citizens gather in a giant - and illegal - flea market, buying and selling
everything and anything despite city council attempts to ban such markets
from the centre.
Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, said yesterday that the
government still intended to make the rouble convertible at a rate of 60 to
80 to the dollar - in spite of doubts voiced by officials at the Russian
Central Bank, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. The minister told the Interfax
news agency that the rate was 'fairly realistic', given the Dollars 6bn
stabilisation fund provided by the IMF and the G7 countries - though he
admitted it would bring difficulties for importers and investors.
Mr Georgy Matiukhin, central bank chairman, and Mr Dmitri Tulin, deputy
chairman, have poured cold water in the past few days on the government's
intention to move to a fixed and internally convertible rouble by the
autumn.
Timing the move towards fixing the rouble remains uncertain, given the
doubts of the Central Bank - without whose co-operation it could not happen.
The Central Bank will be in the dock itself next week, following a decision
of the Russian parliament to examine its performance. Many deputies consider
it has ceased to be responsive to the will of parliament, under whose
jurisdiction it falls.
