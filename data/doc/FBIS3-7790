  [Text] In President Lech Walesa's view, a constitution 
still ought to be adopted before the presidential elections next 
year. In the course of a meeting with journalists at Gdansk 
Television studios, Walesa stated that he had foreseen the 
conflicts against the background of the decision of the National 
Radio and Television Broadcasting Council on the matter of 
concessions for radio and television program broadcasting. The 
president announced that he will support various political 
forces so as to maintain equilibrium in the country. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] According to Walesa, the 
decisions contained in the new constitution ought to be intended 
to remove possible conflicts that could paralyze the executive 
power, and also widen the range of the president's prerogatives. 
  [Walesa] "I would wish that Poland be well steered. I would 
like -- the point is not, is not that I would like to have a lot 
of power, but an opportunity for quicker decisions, quite simply 
the undertaking of quicker decisions. Parliament ought to, 
really, concern itself above all with legal equipping [as 
heard], and not with ruling, not with the creation of 
coalitions, that is not the point." 
  [Correspondent] In Walesa's view, there is no other way out 
for Poland than a presidential system. The rejection by 
parliament of the presidential draft laws on the adoption of a 
Constitution was acknowledged by Walesa to be spitefulness on 
the part of the Sejm, and arrogance by the post-communists. The 
president does not acknowledge the withdrawal of his 
representative from the work of the [Sejm] Constitutional 
Commission to be the suspension of work on a constitution. 
  [Walesa] "I just say that the majority remain outside of 
parliament, and I will look on, and I am ready to, with this 
majority, to do something with this majority. On the subject of 
a constitution, I wanted, as the first approach, if the 
arrogance of parliament had not taken place, then I thought 
that, that what I propose will cause this majority to join in 
work on a constitution, together with this parliament. If it 
had not been rejected, then this draft had to succeed for me." 
  [Correspondent] Walesa said that he had envisaged that the 
decisions of the National Radio and Television Broadcasting 
Council would bring about a storm on the matter of concessions. 
In the president's view there does exist the possibility of the 
entire council's recall. 
  [Walesa] "If all these things turn out to be true, what was 
carried today in RZECZPOSPOLITA, and also a number of facts 
about which I in turn know, as the president, then this cannot 
end other than as I proposed. It is not true that I do not have 
any legal moves there. There are some. The law is none too 
precise. There are a number of moves that I can still make. I 
will strive, of course I told the lawyers to precisely check 
this, since I after all do not know the law so precisely. I 
would not wish that I be led into error. I really do not want 
to break any law." 
  [Correspondent] The president expressed himself in favor of 
an intelligently carried through decommunization and vetting 
procedure.
