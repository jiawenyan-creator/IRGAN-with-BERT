<F P=106> [Report by Mario Cueto Cardenas from Huamanga, Ayacucho] </F>
  [Excerpt] National Police from the 9th Subregion have 
arrested Comrade Maria, who was in charge of organizing the 
Shining Path local committee in Ayacucho. Police said Comrade 
Maria and two other terrorists will be presented to the media in 
the next few days. 
  Police said these captures allowed the deactivation of 
future 
actions against local officials. This is why police distributed 
special instructions for personal security and invited officials 
to carry out target practice with short- and long-range weapons.
