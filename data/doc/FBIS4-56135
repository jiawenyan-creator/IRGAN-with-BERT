  [Text] Prague, May 26 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry 
issued a communique today expressing concern over rising tension 
in Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and the hope that it is solved by 
political means without compromising Ukraine's territorial 
integrity. The sovereignty of Ukraine, to which Crimea has 
belonged since the 1956, and internal stability in the region 
are of paramount importance for peace and normal developments in 
Eastern Europe, the statement reads. 
  In its bilateral relations with Ukraine the Czech Republic 
seeks to support and strengthen the democratic system and the 
transition to a market economy in Ukraine, it says. 
  Russian-Ukrainian talks are currently underway on sharing 
the 
Black Sea Fleet and defusing tension over the Crimea. The 
political leadership of Crimea last week adopted a new 
constitution loosening ties with Kiev and moving towards 
realignment with Russia. There is a sizable Russian majority in 
Crimea, which was formerly administered by Russia.
