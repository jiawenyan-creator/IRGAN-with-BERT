FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Harmony Prop joins main market
Harmony Property yesterday completed its transformation from a pubs and
restaurant company into an investment property group by joining the Official
List, writes Tim Burt.
Shares in the group, which has acquired a Pounds 7.5m portfolio giving
income of Pounds 750,000 in the past year, closed up  1/4 p at 9 1/4 p.
Although the company still retains the leasehold on seven pubs and hotels,
Mr John Main, chairman, said they did not form part of its long-term
strategy. He predicted further property acquisitions, but ruled out
investment in 'speculative' developments. 'We've spent a year turning this
company round,' he added. 'Now we're ready to develop a high-yield
portfolio.'
Mr Main initiated the transformation last year, after joining from Southend
Property Holdings.
