  [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos expressed 
his concern over the upsurge in violence in Turkey following 
yesterday's bomb attack against the Ecumenical Patriarchy in 
Istanbul. Venizelos stressed a point in U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's letter to Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and 
Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller in which Clinton raises the 
issue of the status and protection of the Ecumenical Patriarchy.
