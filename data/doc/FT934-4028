FT  06 DEC 93 / International Company News: Kugelfischer sees improvement
FAG Kugelfischer, the German ball-bearing manufacturer, said its
third-quarter operating loss declined 'noticeably'and it expects improvement
to continued in the fourth quarter of the year, Reuter reports from
Frankfurt.
While the company did not give any specific figures, it attributed the
improvement to its restructuring programme.
Group sales for the full year are forecast at around 15 per cent lower than
in 1992, at about DM3bn (Dollars 1.7bn).
The company attributed that drop to the divestiture of some of its
subsidiaries and units.
Kugelfischer said 10,400 jobs had been shed in the first nine months of the
year - a third of the 31,000 workforce at end-1992.  By the year-end, about
half of last year's number will remain, the company said.
