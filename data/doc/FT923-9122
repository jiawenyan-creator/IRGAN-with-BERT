FT  07 AUG 92 / Clifford accused of trying court ploy
MR CLARK CLIFFORD, the former US defence secretary, who was charged last
month over the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal, has been
accused by a New York prosecutor of trying to manipulate the US judicial
system.
The accusation by a deputy to Mr Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district
attorney, came in a New York court hearing that set an October 22 trial for
Mr Clifford and Mr Robert Altman, his partner.
The two men were charged in New York on July 29 on charges of bribe-taking,
conspiracy and a scheme to commit fraud, related to their dealings with BCCI
during the 1980s.
Both were also charged in Washington of allegedly lying to federal banking
regulators about their knowledge of BCCI's secret ownership of First
American Bankshares, a Washington bank they ran during the 1980s.
The New York trial date is important because a Washington judge had earlier
set October 26 as the date of the Washington trial of Mr Clifford and Mr
Altman. That trial may now have to be postponed.
Mr John Moscow, the chief prosecutor for Mr Morgenthau's office, told a New
York judge that the 85-year-old Mr Clifford and his lawyers were trying to
manipulate the judicial system by seeking a Washington trial first.
Mr Moscow said yesterday the New York charges were much broader and more
serious and noted that if a Washington trial went ahead first Mr Clifford
might have been able to avoid facing the New York charges because of double
jeopardy provisions in New York state law.
Mr Clifford's lawyers had argued for a speedy trial on the grounds of health
but in court they denied Mr Moscow's claim that in doing so they were trying
to manipulate the judicial system.
