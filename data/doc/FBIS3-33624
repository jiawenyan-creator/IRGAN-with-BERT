  [Text] Maria del Rosario Casas, the Colombian spy who was 
working for the Russian KGB, had access to confidential 
information on the M-19 [19 April Movement] peace process during 
the time she worked at the Colombian Embassy in Mexico. The 
question that emerges now is if she also provided information 
concerning Colombian domestic policy to the CIA. 
  During her time at the embassy, Casas not only had access to 
intimate information on the Colombian guerrillas but on other 
Central American subversive groups who at that time took their 
ideological leadership from the USSR. 
  Rafael Vergara Navarro, the M-19's international secretary, 
addressed the issue. 
  [Begin Vergara recording] In 1982 and 1983 there was 
considerable intellectual and political activity in Mexico. If 
she was, in fact, working for the CIA, she was in a marvelous 
position to prepare her reports and submit them. [end recording] 
  Residents of the San Diego neighborhood in Cartagena have 
vague memories of the Casas-Ames couple, who made rare visits to 
a home they own there. Augusto Vaca, a neighbor, had this to 
say about the Ames. 
  [Begin Vaca recording] They were very quiet, reserved 
people. They never established close connections in the 
neighborhood. [end recording] 
  According to residents of San Diego, the alleged spy couple 
last visited the neighborhood in 1987.
