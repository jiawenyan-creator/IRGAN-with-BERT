I. Background



Excess payments of royalties, rentals, bonuses, or other amounts made under OCS mineral leases result from a variety
of reasons (discussed in detail in the preamble to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) at 58 FR 5347053471,
October 15, 1993). Section 10(a) requires that a request for refund or credit of an excess payment made in connection
with any lease issued under that Act be filed with the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) within 2 years after making
the payment. Section 10(b) requires that all refunds or credits which the Secretary proposes to approve be reported
to Congress, and that the Secretary wait at least 30 days while Congress is in continuous session before making a refund
payment or authorizing a credit. Any repayment made pursuant to the Act must be without interest.

The purpose of these regulations is to codify the Department's interpretation and application of section 10, incorporating
the policies and decisions from the various legal opinions, administrative decisions, and administrative practice
which are discussed in detail in the preamble to the NOPR.



II. Comments on Proposed Rule



The proposed rulemaking (58 FR 53470, October 15, 1993) provided for a 60-day public comment period, which ended December
14, 1993. Eleven commenters submitted written comments during this period. The principal comments are addressed
in this section.



General Comments



(a) Several commenters requested that MMS revisit the reasoning and legal arguments contained in the 1981 M-opinion
Refunds and Credits Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act M36942, 88 I.D. 1091 (December 15, 1981) (``1981
M-Opinion''). One commenter proposed that MMS not permit offsetting as a means to recover an overpayment for one production
month to the extent underpayments exist on the same lease for another month. Another commenter requested MMS to reconsider
the operation of the 2-year period for requesting refund or credit, suggesting it could start later than the date of
payment in specific circumstances. This same commenter also suggested that section 10 should be construed to apply
only to refunds, with credit adjustments not subject to section 10's limitation.



Response:

 MMS disagrees with these comments. The 1981 M-Opinion, and a second M-Opinion, Applicability of section 10 of the
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, M36977 (Jan. 15, 1993) (``1993 M-Opinion''), reflect the Department's
interpretation of section 10's requirements. The Department is not convinced that its legal view is wrong. Therefore,
the purpose of the rulemaking is to codify the Department's existing interpretation and application of section 10.

(b) A commenter suggested that the regulations should require the Government to act on a refund request within 90 days.
Absent such action the lessee should automatically be authorized to process a credit adjustment.



Response:

 Section 10 is specific in the procedures that must be followed for approval of a refund or credit. Unless those preconditions
are satisfied, MMS does not have the legal authority to allow a refund or credit to be processed. The MMS has recognized
the obvious importance of approving refund requests quickly by changing procedures to expedite the process. For
example, the purpose of approval subject to audit at 230.455 is to eliminate the audit time delay required for
recoupment authorizations. Such audits will still be required for certain cash refunds.

(c) Several commenters stated that MMS should make any new rules prospective, with an effective date on or after the
date of publication.



Response:

 With one exception, the rulemaking codifies the Department's current interpretation and application of section
10. That exception is 230.458(b), which imposes an assessment of $500 for each unauthorized credit adjustment.
This assessment will apply only to transactions filed after the effective date of the regulations.
