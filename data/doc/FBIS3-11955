  [Text] Resigning Prime Minister Robert's reaction has not 
been long in coming. In a press release, resigning Prime 
Minister Robert Malval says he listened with indignation to Mr. 
Emmanuel Constant's [leader of the Revolutionary Front for the 
Promotion and Progress of Haiti] threats during a news 
conference held on 24 March. Constant warned the ministers of 
Malval's government. They have been summoned not to go to their 
offices as of Monday, 28 March. The prime minister advised that 
Constant would be held personally responsible for any attacks in 
which a member of the government might be the victim, with all 
the legal consequences. On that score, the the press release 
signed by interim Prime Minister Robert Malval concludes by 
saying the prime 
sent a letter to the public order officials.
