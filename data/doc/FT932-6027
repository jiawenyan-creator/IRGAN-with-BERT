FT  01 JUN 93 / Walesa ready to head 'movement of reforms'
PRESIDENT Lech Walesa yesterday told Poles the country's market reforms must
not stop 'half way' and he was ready, should the need arise, to place
himself at the head of the 'movement of reforms'. The president dissolved
parliament last week ahead of new elections in September.
The TV speech came after Mr Walesa had signalled continuing support for Ms
Hanna Suchocka, the outgoing prime minister and her cabinet by vetoing
planned pension rises which threatened to destroy this year's budgetary
targets.
The increases which were approved recently by parliament and would have
added 21,000bn zlotys (Pounds 800m) to this year's 81,000bn zlotys budget
deficit or the 5 per cent of GDP agreed at the beginning of the year with
the IMF.
The unpopular decision follows a no-confidence motion in the week. This led
Mr Walesa to dissolve parliament, leaving the government with a caretaker
role until the elections.
Yesterday Mr Walesa also announced he would approve an election law which
will eliminate from the next parliament parties which fail to win 5 per cent
of the vote.
