  [Text] Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the State Duma committee 
for Economic Policy, described the present state of affairs in 
the Russian economy as "not very reassuring." In the 
parliamentarian's opinion, the problem of the state budget has 
now been advanced to the fore. The real economic policy which 
exists in concealed form in the draft does not help the country 
to emerge from the economic crisis and gives no guarantees 
against a descent into hyperinflation and a catastrophic slump 
in production.
