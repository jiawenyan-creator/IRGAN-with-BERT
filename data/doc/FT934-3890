FT  07 DEC 93 / Observer: Staunch salarymen
Akio Morita, Sony's 72-year-old chairman, has fallen ill at a particularly
inopportune moment.
Until he collapsed with a brain haemorrhage last week, Morita was hotly
tipped to succeed the 78-year-old Gaishi Hiraiwa as chairman of the
Keidanren, Japan's powerful business federation, on Hiraiwa's retirement
next year.
Bringing in the self-made electronics industry boss would have been a big
change from Keidanren's traditional reliance on filling the top job with
salarymen from older industries.
Hiraiwa started his career as a washing machine salesman, eventually working
his way up the salaryman ladder to the top of the giant Tokyo Electric
Power.
Morita's straight talking, his outspoken condemnation of protectionism and
his fearless criticism of US and European management failings all strongly
contrast with Hiraiwa's courtly diplomatic style.
Nobody knows whether or not Morita will eventually recover sufficiently to
be able to take the Keidanren job; but it's looking unlikely.
If he does bow out, a discreet competition can now be expected between the
four runners-up: Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota; Shoichi Saba, an
adviser to Toshiba; Hiroshi Saito, chairman of Nippon Steel; and Yotaro
Iida, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries - all stalwarts of the grand
old schools of Japanese industry.
