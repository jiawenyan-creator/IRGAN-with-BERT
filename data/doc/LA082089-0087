GIRL, 6, KILLED AS CAR FLIPS ON ROADWAY 
A 6-year-old San Diego girl was killed Saturday morning when the car she was 
riding in flipped over on a Mission Valley freeway ramp after being sideswiped. 
Elise Arent was pronounced dead at the scene, officials said. 
Injured in the 11:30 a.m. traffic accident were her father, Terry Arent, 32, 
who was listed in serious condition at Mercy Hospital, and her mother, Shelly 
Arent, 32, who was treated for minor injuries at the UC San Diego Medical 
Center. 
They were not wearing seat belts, officials said. But another child in the car, 
identified as 1-year-old Ashley Arent, was strapped into an infant seat and 
escaped unharmed. 
Kathy Gill, a California Highway Patrol spokeswoman, said the accident occurred 
when another vehicle illegally passed the Arent car on the ramp leading from 
southbound California 163 to westbound Interstate 8. 
She said the passing car struck the Arent vehicle, which then overturned. The 
driver of the other car, Gary R. Hoag, 26, of San Diego was being questioned, 
the CHP said.
