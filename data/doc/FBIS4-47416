  [Abstract] The Laboratory of Bioluminescence and 
Bioacoustics of the Institute for the Biology of the Southern 
Seas, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, in Sevastopol, has been 
studying the bioluminescent species of the Black Sea since 1965. 
Thirty-eight bioluminescent dinoflagellates have been 
identified, of which 13 were previously reported in the 
literature. The basic energetic parameters of the emissions 
exhibited by 30 of the species are tabulated. Changes in these 
parameters can serve as powerful indicators of anthropogenic 
pollution. The amplitude of the emission of Noctiluca miliaris 
changes with varying concentrations of phenol, PCB, or 
petroleum, or on exposure to gamma radiation. Chronic 35-day 
exposure was always found to convert initial stimulatory effects 
to inhibition. The early changes exhibited an oscillating 
nature, due to acclimatization. The amplitude of bioluminescence 
was found to be lowest at the center of the Sevastopol bay and 
highest ten miles from shore, with samples taken at five miles 
giving intermediate values. Heavy metals and other toxins may 
cause this change by decreasing the number and activity of 
scintillons, eliciting membrane degeneration, or inhibiting 
necessary enzyme systems. Figures 2; references 28: 17 Russian,
