FT  28 OCT 94 / Bangladesh crisis deepens
Bangladesh's parliament was summoned to meet on November 12 as the
Commonwealth-brokered talks between the government of Prime Minister Khaleda
Zia and opposition leaders resumed yesterday. Sir Ninian Stephen, a
Commonwealth emissary, joined the talks aimed at ending the impasse created
by opposition demands for fresh elections under a non-partisan caretaker
government. All 154 opposition MPs have boycotted parliament and staged
rallies and general strikes since March to press for Mrs Zia's resignation
and fresh elections. Mrs Zia, who came to power in 1991 after a decade of
military rule, was elected in polls which observers judged mostly free and
fair. But the opposition parties, led by Mrs Sheikh Hasina's Awami League,
claim they were rigged and say the government has interfered in subsequent
local and by-elections. Sir Ninian, who arrived in Bangladesh a fortnight
ago, has held a series of meetings with government and opposition leaders to
aimed at narrowing their differences and ending the crisis. On Wednesday, he
averted a breakdown of talks between government and opposition leaders.
