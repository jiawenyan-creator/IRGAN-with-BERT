  [Abstract] The model used in this study covers altitudes 
from 0 to 60 km and considers chemical and photochemical 
processes involving O, H, C, N, and Cl. The temperature and 
density used in the model are representative of March at 
45N. The model is one-dimensional and yields global average 
daily vertical profiles of atmospheric components. There is a 
satisfactory agreement between the theoretical models and 
observational data in most cases; however, there are substantial 
divergences in the concentrations of several components at 
various altitudes. For example, the models used here yielded 
excessive amounts of NHO[.sup]3[/], much less 
H[.sup]2[/]O, and at higher altitudes, noticeably less 
CH[.sup]4[/] and H[.sub]2[/]. This may be due to problems 
with the chemical scheme of the model due to a poor description 
of vertical transfer, as well as incorrect treatment of 
turbulent mixing. Further study is required to identify physical 
and chemical processes responsible for these divergences. Models 
and observational data can be more accurately compared by using 
two-dimensional and three-dimensional models. Individuals 
ections of the article discuss active and inert components, 
HNO[.sup]3[/] and O[.sub]3[/]. Figures 22; references 8: 2
