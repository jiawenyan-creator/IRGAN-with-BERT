  [Excerpts] Peru produces about 2,000 metric tons of basic 
cocaine paste per year, of which 90 percent is "exported" by the 
mafias to various places in the world, according to an 
evaluation in the draft of the National Prevention and Drug 
Control Plan. 
  About 900 metric tons of refined basic cocaine (valued at 
about $600 million) are produced from the aforementioned 
tonnage. This represents a potential annual production of 
between 650 and 700 metric tons of cocaine hydrochlorate. 
  The figures in this document are very revealing and make 
clear the increase of coca leaf's cultivation for illegal ends 
and the "cocalization" of the economy. [passage omitted] 
  These figures also demonstrate the very large differences 
that exist between the legal and illegal cultivation of coca 
leaf. 
  There are at least 200,000 campesino families that illegally 
cultivate the leaf, while there are only 27,000 families that 
cultivate it legally, located mainly in La Convencion and Lares 
Valleys in Cuzco Department. 
  Exact statistics do no exist, but it is estimated that 
between 15,000 and 20,000 hectares are currently dedicated to 
the legal cultivation of the leaf and a minimum of 10,000 metric 
tons of coca leaf are produced yearly. This is a very small 
quantity when it is compared to the 223,900 metric tons produced 
illegally. 
  But the functioning National Coca Enterprise (Enaco) is a 
demonstration of state organizations' lack of efficiency in the 
control of these cultivations. 
  Enaco is charged with exercising the monopoly of the 
commercialization and industrialization of coca leaf, but it 
does not control even one-half of the area and production of 
legal coca leaf production. [passage omitted]
