WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD; 
GAY GROUP PRESENTS AWARDS 
The Rev. Carl Bean, founder of the Minority AIDS Project, and Virginia Uribe, a 
guidance counselor at Fairfax High School, this week were named man and woman 
of the year by the organization that sponsors the annual Los Angeles Gay and 
Lesbian Pride Celebration in West Hollywood. 
Christopher Street West, the nonprofit corporation that sponsors the 
celebration, presented the awards Tuesday at the Le Parc Hotel in West 
Hollywood. 
Bean, a Los Angeles minister, was recognized for his work in founding the 
Minority AIDS Project, which provides services to AIDS patients in the minority 
community. 
Uribe was selected for her work in establishing Project 10, a controversial 
program at Fairfax High School that provides special counseling to gay and 
lesbian students. 
An award named in honor of the late San Francisco Mayor George Moscone was 
presented to state Controller Gray Davis for "speaking out on behalf of gay and 
lesbian issues when it did not necessarily flatter him to do so," Christopher 
Street West spokesman David M. Smith said. 
Another award, named in honor of the late San Francisco Councilman Harvey Milk, 
went to nightclub owner and former West Hollywood City Council candidate Gene 
LaPietra. 
The LaPietra Foundation was instrumental in supporting the Chris Brownlee 
Hospice, an AIDS unit at Barlow Hospital in Elysian Park, Smith said.
