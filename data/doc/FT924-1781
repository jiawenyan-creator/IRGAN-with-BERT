FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: Phibro restructuring aims to
refine its operations - The Salomon unit is going back to basics by focusing
on oil products trading
PHIBRO Energy, the US oil trading and refining company, briefly emerged
recently from the shadow of its more illustrious parent, the Wall Street
securities house Salomon, to announce a significant restructuring.
The changes involve taking Phibro out of the business of making markets in
physical oil products and merging the remaining trading and refining
operations into Salomon. This represents something of a retreat from the oil
business for Salomon, which is taking a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge of
between Dollars 25m and Dollars 35m to cover the costs of the changes.
As recently as May of last year, Mr Andrew Hall, Phibro's chairman, was
discussing ambitious plans. There was talk of building Phibro into an
operation worthy of joining the ranks of the leading oil companies, one that
was involved in every part of the business from the oil well to the petrol
pump.
This seemed conceivable in the late 1980s when, due to some astute bets on
oil prices and a healthy refining business, Phibro was making huge profits.
In 1990, it earned Dollars 492m, more than Salomon's marquee bond trading
business.
Those ambitions, however, never came close to realisation. An unfavourable
shift in oil market conditions (trading companies thrive on volatility, but
since the end of the Gulf war oil prices have been unusually stable and
low), narrowing margins in the oil products trading business, and losses on
a risky oil production joint venture in Russia took their toll.
In 1991, the company plunged into the red with a Dollars 34m loss. This year
has been not much better - in the most recent quarter, Phibro reported a
pre-tax loss of Dollars 23m.
These problems, coupled with separate, but equally important, upheavals
within Salomon's Wall Street business stemming from the August 1991 bond
market scandal at its Salomon Brothers unit, convinced Phibro's and its
parent's management that big changes were required.
As Mr Robert Denham, Salomon's chairman, says, the motivation to restructure
Phibro came from Mr Hall, who felt Salomon's shareholders would be best
served if Phibro handed over the refining and production operations to
Salomon, where they would report directly to Mr Denham, and if the company
restructured its oil products trading business.
This would leave Phibro, and Mr Hall, to concentrate on trading crude oil,
selective oil products, precious metals, petrochemicals, other commodities
and energy-related derivative products. Mr Hall maintains: 'I wanted to
devote my attention 100 per cent to our trading business - that's where we
get the best returns on our capital.'
Phibro, in fact, was getting no return on its capital from its oil products
marketmaking operations, which had become increasingly unprofitable as the
business became more transparent and competitive. Mr Hall says: 'When you
add it all up, the margins of the business just don't cover the hidden
costs.'
The separation of Phibro USA, which owns four oil refineries, from Phibro's
trading operation is a blow to Mr Hall's hopes that profitable synergies
would result from running the two together.
It is something that Mr Hall appears to have come to terms with some time
ago, because the refining business has recently been run from Houston,
Texas, as a stand-alone operation with its own small trading staff.
The future of the refining business is now Mr Denham's responsibility. The
Salomon chairman, a lawyer by trade and with no particular experience of the
oil business, says his role is to 'think in an economically rational way
about strategic decisions' affecting the operation.
Options being considered include joint ventures, a spin-off of the business
to shareholders, or an outright sale of the refineries. Mr Denham, however,
is in no hurry: 'There is nothing horribly broken in the business that
requires an immediate fix.'
The question of what to do with Phibro Energy Production, the big joint
production venture in Russia known as White Knights, is also now Mr Denham's
responsibility. Although White Knights - the largest foreign oil venture in
the former Soviet Union - is producing plenty of oil for export, a
complicated and unresolved tax problem means Phibro is losing money on what
was always a high-risk operation.
The main impact of the Russian venture so far has been to dissuade Phibro
from becoming more involved in the production business. Mr Denham says: 'I
suppose if the White Knights experience had been a super success . . . that
would have encouraged us in the original direction - the thought that White
Knights would be the first step towards more production ventures.'
Mr Denham does not expect to spend much time on White Knights; he is happy
with the project's management team, and is cautiously optimistic. 'I still
think that we have a pretty reasonable prospect of getting money out of it.'
The changes at Phibro should be seen in the wider context of the recent
restructuring of its parent, Salomon. When Mr Warren Buffet, the billionaire
investor, took over the chairmanship of Salomon immediately after last
year's bond trading scandal, one of his earliest criticisms was that Salomon
Inc, the parent company, and Phibro, the oil business, were both run to
benefit Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street firm.
In contrast, Mr Buffet wanted to run the group for the benefit of its
shareholders, by having a holding company (Salomon Inc) that acted as a
holding company. Mr Denham, who took over from Mr Buffet earlier this year,
inherited a new management structure that ensured the two subsidiaries were
run to benefit the parent company.
The integration of Phibro into the parent group is, therefore, a
continuation of Buffet's reforms, which also included Salomon Brothers
refocusing on its core businesses.
As one Wall Street analyst says of the Phibro restructuring: 'Look at it in
the context of Salomon's restructuring - it's a getting back to basics. Oil
refining and production was always a bit out of the way for them.'
