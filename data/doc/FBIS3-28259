  [Text] Jakarta, Feb 4 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- Armed Forces 
Commander General Feizal Tanjung said that recent demonstrations 
staged by students and workers at a more frequent rate are still 
considered to be at the level of toleration. Gen. Tanjung said 
in a parliamentary hearing here Thursday that the recent 
demonstrations have not yet disturbed the national stability as 
they were held spontaneously to protest unfair social conditions. 
  Student protest demonstrations are understandable, the 
commander said, and should be welcomed as they reflect the 
student's awareness of what is happening around them. However, 
he said, the government should always be on the alert to prevent 
such demonstrations from becoming a public disturbance which can 
threaten national stability. 
  Tanjung dismissed widespread opinions that the government, 
in 
this case the Armed Forces is being over reactive to the 
demonstrations, thereby spoiling the government's promotion of 
openness and democratisation as well as human rights in the 
country. 
  "Such a view is not right. The armed forces are always 
committed to acting in accordance with values contained in the 
system of pancasila democracy," he said. 
  Any actions being launched by the Armed Forces are always 
based on the existing law and regulations, and more is aimed at 
preventing law violations, the general stressed. 
  Amid the meeting between the armed forces commander with the 
parliamentary commission in charge of security affairs, a number 
of youths were demonstrating outside the parliament building to 
protest against Bakrie Brothers's plan to build a resort near 
Tanah Lot temple on the tourist island of Bali.
