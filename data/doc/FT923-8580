FT  11 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Seacon ahead 47% to more than Pounds 1m
Seacon Holdings, the shipping and distribution group, increased pre-tax
profits by 47 per cent, from Pounds 717,000 to Pounds 1.05m, in the half
year ended March 31.
Turnover was marginally lower at Pounds 9.52m (Pounds 9.58m) but operating
profit doubled to Pounds 669,000.
Reduced charter hire rates, a more stable D-Mark/sterling relationship and
lower bunkering costs all contributed to better results.
With freight rates often below those of last year, static turnover indicated
an increase in market share. In cargo handling and distribution tonnages to
date had increased and eased the consequences of severely squeezed margins.
The interim dividend is lifted to 2p (1.5p) and a minimum total of 5p (4.2p)
is forecast. Fully diluted earnings per share were 6.88p (4.67p).
