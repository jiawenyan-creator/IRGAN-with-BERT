  [Text] Washington, June 10 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today announced new sanctions against Haiti to intensify 
the pressure on its military leaders. 
  The new measures include a ban on commercial air traffic 
between the United States and Haiti and sanctions on financial 
transactions between the two countries. 
  Clinton said in a White House announcement that these two 
steps are necessary to intensify the pressure on the Haitian 
military leaders who drove elected President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide into exile in 1991. 
  "These steps represent an important new stage in our efforts 
to restore democracy and return President Aristide to Haiti," he 
said. 
  "The message is simple, democracy must be restored, the coup 
must not endure," Clinton stressed. 
  The new sanctions "have been endorsed by the Organization of 
American States, the friends of Haiti, and President Aristide," 
said William Gray, special adviser to the President on Haiti, at 
a White House briefing after Clinton's announcement. 
  "Through these actions, we are sending a strong message to 
Haiti's military leaders that they cannot continue repressing 
their people and defying world opinion with impunity," Gray said. 
  Asked if a military option on Haiti will be taken, Gray said 
that "All options are on the table. We are pursuing a 
multilateral policy with our allies in the region." 
  He also said that "We will continue to work in a 
multilateral 
way to apply the maximum amount of pressure and to use every 
option available to restore democracy."
