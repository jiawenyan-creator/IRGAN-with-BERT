FT  18 NOV 92 / Management: Big operation to improve the lot of women
workers / Case study - Health Service
The NHS has come under fire from, among others, the Equal Opportunities
Commission, for being an organisation that is overwhelmingly staffed by
women but run by men.
Piecemeal measures had produced few results. Nearly 80 per cent of the NHS's
1m workers are female, making it the largest employer of women in Europe. By
the end of 1994 the aim is to increase the number of women in general
management posts to 30 per cent, from 18 per cent in 1991.
The intention is to push up the proportion of women who are members of
health authorities and trusts from 29 per cent in 1991 to 35 per cent by
1994; it is also hoped to increase the percentage of female consultants by
10 per cent each year.
A national register of women in senior management posts is being set up and
a career development manager will be responsible for providing details of
suitable female candidates for top managerial vacancies.
