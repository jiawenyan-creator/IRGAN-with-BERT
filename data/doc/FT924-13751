FT  14 OCT 92 / Number of business failures fell
THE NUMBER of business failures fell for the second consecutive quarter,
according to figures from Trade Indemnity, the trade credit insurer.
It said 1,780 companies collapsed in the three months to the end of
September, a decline of 7 per cent on the previous quarter, which was in
turn 8 per cent below the first-quarter figure.
Trade Indemnity's figures showed the number of failures as 51 per cent
higher than the same three months a year before. The group said the failure
rate continued to rise 12 to 18 months after the end of the early 1980s
recession.
