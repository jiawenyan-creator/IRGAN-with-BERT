FT  19 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Opt-out no incentive for jobs
Sir, David Hunt, the employment secretary, has opted out of the real world
if he believes that saving the jobs of newspaper boys and girls ('UK wins
opt-out on labour law', October 13) will lead to an increase in
multinational investment in the UK. Presumably we shall see yet more adverts
encouraging foreign companies to take advantage of Britain's low-paid,
long-suffering, unprotected yet 'wildly enthusiastic' youth.
The fact is that David Hunt's claim that the British opt-out of European
laws protecting 16- and 17-year-olds will lead to multinationals moving to
Britain is sheer nonsense. Figures produced by the GMB taken from the 1991
census show that 16- and 17-year-olds make up just 2.29 per cent of the
British workforce. The idea that this deregulation will persuade employers
to uproot and move to the UK for such marginal reasons is ridiculous.
The government can hardly claim that the lack of statutory protection of
wages or conditions will lead to more jobs being created for young people.
Self-evidently it has not. Britain has 1m young people out of work.
Unemployment among 18- to 25-year-olds is twice as high as in the rest of
the population; they earn less than the rest, about 53 per cent of average
earnings.
Just what young people are supposed to make of this government's antics is
beyond me. These days ministers only ever refer to young people as future
recipients of custodial sentences, drains on the welfare state, or queue
jumpers in the housing waiting list.
David Hunt ought to be addressing Britain's skills gap and the training
needs of young people today. Perhaps then multinationals might consider
locating in the UK.
