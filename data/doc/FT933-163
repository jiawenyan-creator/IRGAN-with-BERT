FT  30 SEP 93 / Observer: Davis's gamble
No doubt first-hand experience of the Lloyd's market will help Peter Davis,
yesterday revealed as the man to run the National Lottery, to handle
disappointed losers sensitively. But in other respects he himself may be
something of a gamble for the government in its new multi-billion
revenue-raising exercise.
Davis, 51, who resigned as group finance director and deputy chairman of
large underwriter Sturge Holdings in March, apparently has the blend of
accountancy skills and retailing experience that the Department of National
Heritage believes will make the new institution a winner.
A high-flyer at Price Waterhouse, he was regarded as something of a catch in
1980 when he landed at Sir Phil Harris's carpet business. But his Harris
Queensway stint ended less than happily seven years later, when Davis and
other directors walked out. The former PW partner was criticised for failing
to put in place the tough controls that were needed, though Harris is also
known as a poor delegator.
Davis was then brought into Sturge to mastermind diversification of its
business outside Lloyd's, but when the emphasis later turned to stringent
cost-cutting, Davis decided to go.
The national heritage department lets on that the new boy 'likes an
occasional flutter on the National or the Derby'. But he is basically a
cautious soul at heart. Sir Phil certainly owes him one, for it was
apparently on Davis's advice that the carpet tycoon decided not to become a
Name at Lloyd's.
