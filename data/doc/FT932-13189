FT  24 APR 93 / Letter: Outrageous, but at the same time entertaining (1)
Sir, I feel compelled to write a few words in support of Michael
Thompson-Noel following the outraged letter from J G Freeland (April 17-18).
I admit that Mr Thompson-Noel is often outrageous and was wrong to attribute
blanket low intelligence to National Hunt supporters (Hawks &amp; Handsaws,
April 10-11). After all, whatever it should be, intelligence is no guarantee
against sensitive behaviour.
Notwithstanding, Mr Thompson-Noel has made me laugh aloud spontaneously more
times than Mr John Major and he conveys to me the impression of someone
genuinely disturbed by the poor health of our society and the archaic and
often disreputable nature of many of our institutions. Long may his
idiosyncratic imagination flourish, and away with Mr Freeland's complacency.
