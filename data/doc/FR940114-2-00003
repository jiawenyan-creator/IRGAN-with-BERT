ACTION: 

Notice, intent to prepare environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement on a proposal to harvest 3040 million board
feet of both merchantable and unmerchantable wood products from approximately 8,000 acres of National Forest System
lands on the east side of Lake Tahoe in Nevada. Dead and dying trees would be cut, and a green tree thinning component
is also proposed to improve forest health. Jeffrey pine beetle suppression comprises part of the project. The proposed
action also uses prescribed fire and analyzes post sale treatments, including watershed improvement projects.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Agencies and the public are invited to participate at any stage of the process; however, the Forest Supervisor requests
that individuals concerned with the scope of the analysis comment by February 14, 1994.

ADDRESSES: 

Written comments concerning the DEIS should be sent to the responsible official, Forest Supervisor, LTBMU, 870 Emerald
Bay Road, Suite 1, South Lake Tahoe, California, 96150.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The proposed action harvests dead, dying, and diseased trees, many of which are beetle-infested, over approximately
8,000 acres of an 11,000-acre study area. Green trees would be thinned from overstocked stands, over about 2,000 acres,
some of which overlap the salvage acreage, and some of which is separate. Some of the 30 to 40 million board feet removed
will be useful lumber; much of the timber removed will have no commercial value. 




Trees would be removed from gentle slopes by tractor skidding systems. Trees would be flown from steeper terrain by
helicopter. No new permanent roads would be constructed; however, construction of additional temporary access
roads and landing sites would be required, as well as reconstruction and restoration of existing historic roads.
This proposed action includes treatments that will follow removal of the trees. This includes (but is not limited
to) site preparation, planting, treatment of slash generated by the project, obliteration of temporary and unneeded
roads, and restoration of landings. Monitoring how effectively the project prevents future beetle attacks is part
of ``post sale'' work. The use of prescribed fire will be analyzed, both as a post-harvest treatment and as a long-term
management tool. This alternative treats the most acres with prescribed fire.

Heritage (historic archaeological) resources are dispersed throughout the study area. Most are the remains of 19th
century logging, and not all of them will be protected. In addition to mitigation negotiated with the Advisory Council
of Historic Preservation, a key component of the analysis is to seek and address enhancement opportunities for representative
heritage properties.

Watershed restoration projects, road closures, and mistletoe reduction opportunities may also be included in the
proposed action if they are, in the language of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), ``connected'', ``cumulative''
in their effects with the removal of dead trees, or are ``ripe for decision''.


This action is proposed because of current forest mortality stemming from historical activities. Beginning in the
1850's many of the 200500 year old pine trees around Lake Tahoe were harvested in support of silver mining activities
of the Comstock Lode. Earlier, the forest and consisted of diverse species that resisted drought and insect attacks.
After logging slowed in the 1890's, the area began to revegetate naturally. But a new and different forest grew to replace
the old. In the absence of frequently recurring fires, dense thickets of moisture-loving fir trees replaced much
of the open pine forest that had been cut. The drought that began in 1987 weakened and killed those fir trees that had
sprouted after the massive Comstock cutting.
