FT  22 APR 93 / Union to press for rights at Honda
THE AEEU, Britain's largest manufacturing union, is planning a recruitment
and recognition campaign at Honda, the only Japanese car company operating a
non-union plant in Britain.
Mr Michael Jones, Honda's plant manager at Swindon, Wiltshire, said: 'We
just wish to be left alone to achieve our objectives. We work quite happily
together without having a third party.'
Only a handful of the 1,200 Honda workers - associates as the company calls
them - belong to a union. Mr Jones said the company was 'totally committed
to the teamwork approach' and there had been 'no requests' from workers to
have unions recognised.
Honda, like other Japanese car companies in Britain, has a wide range of
employee benefits including private medical insurance.
Mr Jones addded: 'There is no them and us here. We are all us.' Honda staff
have just received a 3.7 per cent pay increase.
The manufacturing union has negotiated single-union agreements at Nissan and
Toyota, the other two Japanese car companies in Britain.
Mr Roger Butler, union executive officer for south-east England, said it
would 'not leave a stone unturned in our campaign to target Honda'. He said
Honda's close links to the unionised Rover group may assist the union in its
efforts.
