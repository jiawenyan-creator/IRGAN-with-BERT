FT  12 OCT 93 / Vietnam reforms praised by IMF
VIETNAM'S market reforms are working well and the country is on track to
catch up with its South-East Asian neighbours, according to the managing
director of the International Monetary Fund, Mr Michel Camdessus.
Speaking at the end of his first day of an official visit to Vietnam, Mr
Camdessus said the government had coped remarkably well since the collapse
of its main supporter, the Soviet Union. He also told his hosts that the IMF
would help Vietnam reschedule its Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 3bn) debt in
negotiations next month with the Paris Club of government creditors and with
its former allies in Russia.
Mr Camdessus has long been an enthusiastic supporter of Vietnam's market
reforms, which began in 1986, and has previously described the country as a
model of economic transformation. His visit to Hanoi comes a week after the
IMF announced a loan of Dollars 223m to Vietnam, its first new loan to the
country for more than 10 years.
That became possible after President Bill Clinton said in July that his
government would no longer block attempts to repay the Vietnamese debt to
the IMF. A consortium of governments and banks, led by Japan and France,
helped Vietnam to repay its Dollars 140m debt to the IMF. The World Bank and
the Asian Development Bank have since followed the lead of the IMF,
announcing project loans to Vietnam worth more than Dollars 500m. More
projects, worth as much again, are expected to be submitted for approval by
the end of the year.
Vietnam has implemented many market reforms since 1986, allowing farmers and
other producers to sell their products at market prices, rather than selling
them to the state at fixed prices. Hanoi has managed to bring the resulting
inflation under control and boost exports.
