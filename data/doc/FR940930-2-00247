 

Material adverse changes in status including voluntary and non-voluntary terminations, defaults, fines, and agency
findings of material non-compliance or non-conformance with agency rules and policies with state and federal agencies
and government sponsored enterprises must be reported to GNMA within 60 business days of their occurrence. 



B. Compliance with the GNMA Multiclass Securities Guide 



Participants will comply with the requirements of the GNMA Multiclass Securities Guide. 



VIII. Appropriate Investors 



GNMA guaranteed multiclass securities may not be suitable investments for all investors. No investor should purchase
securities of any class unless the investor understands, and is able to bear, the prepayment, yield, liquidity and
market risks associated with that class. 



IX. Authority and Full Faith and Credit of the United States 



The General Counsel of the Department of Housing and Urban Development has issued an opinion which concludes that
GNMA has the authority to guarantee multiclass securities and that such GNMA guarantees will constitute general
obligations of the United States backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. 



X. Other Matters 



Information Collections 



The information collection requirements contained in this notice and the associated forms for application for participation
in the program have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for review under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 35013520). HUD has published a notice of that information collection approval
request on September 28, 1994 (59 FR 49410), which invited public comment on them. That notice requested expedited
review of these requirements by OMB. No person may be subjected to a penalty for failure to comply with these information
collection requirements until they have been approved and assigned an OMB control number. The OMB control number,
when assigned, will be announced by separate notice in the 

Federal Register

. 



Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review 



This Notice was reviewed by OMB under Executive Order 12866 as a significant regulatory action. Any changes made in
this Notice as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket file for this Notice, which is available
for public inspection in the Office of HUD's Rules Docket Clerk, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington,
DC 204100500. 



Environmental Review 



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made for the May 26 Notice in accordance
with HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act
of 1969. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays
in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development,
Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20410. This Notice merely amends the May 26 Notice. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that this Notice does not have ``federalism implications'' because it does not have substantial direct effects on
the States (including their political subdivisions), or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among
the various levels of government. This notice only affects participants and investors in GNMA guaranteed single
and multiclass securities industry. States and their political subdivisions would not be affected. 



Executive Order 12606, the Family 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that this
Notice does not have potential significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being because
it only affects participants and investors in GNMA guaranteed single and multiclass securities. 



Lobbying Activities 



Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department 

and

 those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence
the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of
assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 

Section 13 was implemented by a final rule codified as 24 CFR Part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence
the Department in these ways, they are urged to read Part 86, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the
regulation. 

Any questions about that rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, Room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, 451 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 204103000. Telephone: (202) 7083815; TDD
number (202) 7081112. (These are not toll-free numbers.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may
be obtained from the local HUD office.
