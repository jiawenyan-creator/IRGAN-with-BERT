BIG BEAT 
As Anita Crane (wife of former announcer Fred Crane) says in her Oct. 1 letter, 
Tom Dixon, Tom Cassidy, Crane, the one and only mellifluous-voiced Carl Princi 
(she omitted the personable and witty Doug Ordunio) -- all announcers in the 
class days of KFAC -- do not have master's degrees in music. 
If Mary Fain, with her stilted gibberish and fractured pronunciation of foreign 
names, was one of the two recent announcers touted as having master's degrees 
in a Sept. 17 letter from a KFAC executive, both she and the other one should 
demand refunds from their colleges.
