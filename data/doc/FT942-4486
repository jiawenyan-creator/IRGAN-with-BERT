FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Turnpyke in black for second half
Turnpyke Group, the spring manufacturer and property company formerly known
as WB Industries, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 107,000 in the second
half of the 1993 year.
However, it was not enough to overcome first half losses leaving a pre-tax
deficit for the year cut from Pounds 795,000 to Pounds 68,000. Turnover was
down at Pounds 2.45m, against Pounds 6.99m, which included Pounds 4.54m from
discontinued activities.
West Bromwich Spring was the main contributor to the improvement and in the
first five months of the present year it is slightly ahead of its budgeted
profit.
Mr Eric Cater, chairman, said Turnpyke would now be concentrating more on
the property side.
Interest had been shown in its Sheffield properties and terms had been
agreed for the sale of the site but he was not sure when completion would
take place.
Losses per share were 1.21p (12.38p).
