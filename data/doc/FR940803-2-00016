ACTION: 

Notice of intent.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Fort Campbell, Kentucky, requires rail service to deploy rapidly throughout the world. The U.S. Army owns 17 miles
of track from Fort Campbell to the town of Hopkinsville, and approximately three miles of track in the town of Hopkinsville.
Currently, a lengthy switching procedure is required to move a train, necessary during contingency operations and
possibly during major exercises, to or from Fort Campbell. Fort Campbell cannot rapidly deploy the 101st Airborne
Division and other units with the existing switching restrictions in Hopkinsville. The U.S. Army proposes to by-pass
the city of Hopkinsville by purchasing land and constructing a six-mile track along a 100-foot wide corridor from
the Army owned track near the town of Masonville to the CSX, Incorporated mainline near Caskey. The scope of work includes
removing approximately seven miles of track and four bridges north of Masonville. The U.S. Army will reuse the rail,
ties and ballast in the new six-mile track. The precise track terminus north of Masonville will be developed during
the EIS process.



Proposed Alternatives



a. No action

b. Alternate rail corridors



Scoping
