FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bayerische Vereinsbank ahead 24%
to DM1.48bn
BAYERISCHE Vereinsbank, one of Germany's two large Bavaria-based banks,
yesterday demonstrated the banking sector's continuing resilience to the
country's worsening economic downturn.
The bank reported that partial 1992 operating profits - excluding the result
from own-account trading - were up by 24.1 per cent to DM1.48bn (Dollars
889m).
Vereinsbank, the first of Germany's 'big five' commercial banks to report
preliminary figures for 1992, increased total group operating profits by
32.5 per cent to DM1.62bn.
At the parent company level, total operating profits rose by 35.6 per cent
to DM1.06bn.
The dividend is DM13 per share, the same as in the previous six years.
The figures were ahead of expectations and seem likely to confirm analysts'
expectations of excellent profit figures from most of the large banks.
Vereinsbank's Bavarian competitor, Hypo-Bank, is expected to increase
partial-operating profits by 25 per cent, while Commerzbank and Dresdner
Bank are likely to produce double-digit profit growth. At Deutsche, the
largest bank, profits are likely to slip from the record level of 1991.
Vereinsbank will not disclose net profits - calculated after provisions for
bad debts - until its press conference, which is scheduled for Monday.
Analysts are worried about the impact of the worsening economic environment
on the bad debt situation.
The two Bavarian banks have done better than their larger, Frankfurt-based
competitors because their business is less exposed to commercial lending: a
much larger share of business is mortgage, construction-related loans.
While loan demand has slowed significantly at the bigger banks, the
Bavarians have benefited from their exposure to the construction sector  -
one of the few areas of the German economy which is still thriving.
