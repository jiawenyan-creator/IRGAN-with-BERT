  [Excerpt] Brasilia -- Deputy Genebaldo Correia (PMDB-BA 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Bahia State]), who the 
Budget CPA [Congressional Investigating Committee] has charged 
with corruption, resigned his congressional mandate on 21 March 
to avoid being dismissed, and thereby, losing his political 
rights for three years. 
  Correia's resignation nullifies a procedure, involving 17 
congressmen incriminated by the CPI, to strip him of his 
congressional mandate. The Chamber of Deputies Constitution and 
Justice Committee (CCJ) has handled the procedure. Genebaldo 
delivered a speech, marked by emotion, in a quiet voice. He was 
unable to prevent shedding a few tears. [passage omitted]
