HORSEMAN'S GROUP OKS FRIDAY NIGHT PROGRAMS 
Members of the California Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Assn. 
overwhelmingly approved Hollywood Park's proposal for four consecutive Friday 
night programs later in the current meeting. 
According to Don Robbins, Hollywood Park's general manager, the vote was 2,482 
in favor and 563 against. 
This signifies a 28% turnout from the CHBPA members who received ballots, which 
had to be signed in order to be counted. 
The next step for Hollywood Park comes today when track representatives will go 
in front of the California Horse Racing's Board's Operations Committee during 
the Board's meeting, which begins at 10 a.m. at the Airport Marriott. 
If the proposal is given final approval, there will be Friday evening programs 
June 22 and 29 and July 6 and 13. BOB MIESZERSKI
