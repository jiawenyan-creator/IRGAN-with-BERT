FT  22 SEP 93 / London is 'best for business in Europe'
LONDON is considered the best city in Europe to locate a business, a survey
of international managers said yesterday.
The survey found that London had strengthened its position as a commercial
centre. It was carried out by the Harris Research Centre and published by
Healey &amp; Baker, chartered surveyors. For the first time in the survey's
four-year history, the capital was considered to offer the most in terms of
cost and availability of staff.
Paris maintained its position at second, while the third most popular city
was Frankfurt, which retained its top position for international transport
links but lost ground on staff costs and availability.
Glasgow and Manchester both slipped one place to seventh and ninth
respectively.
Fourth-placed Brussels was considered the most important future political
centre.
The survey suggested that Barcelona, Berlin, Lyons and Paris were best at
promoting themselves to international businesses. For the first time Prague
was judged to be one of Europe's most important future manufacturing
centres.
The most important factors influencing relocations were ease of access to
markets and telecommunications. Cost and availability of staff and freedom
from pollution were seen as increasingly important.
A total of 527 senior executives from nine European countries were
interviewed for the survey.
