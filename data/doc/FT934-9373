FT  11 NOV 93 / Canada prepares for record budget deficit
CANADA'S new Liberal government is preparing the ground for bad news on the
federal budget deficit. Officials are suggesting the shortfall could reach a
record CDollars 40bn (Pounds 20.8bn) in the fiscal year ending March 31,
1994, compared to the CDollars 32.6bn deficit predicted last April by the
previous Conservative government.
Estimates of last year's deficit are expected to be revised upwards to well
above the projected CDollars 35.5bn.
Analysts predict that revisions of the federal deficit will be followed by
announcements from several of the 10 provinces that they too will fail to
meet budget forecasts.
The provinces, some of which are heavy borrowers on international capital
markets, have been under pressure to trim deficits. Credit-rating agencies
have warned failure to do so may result in downgrading of creditworthiness
and rising borrowing costs.
Higher deficits, coupled with a narrowing gap between US and Canadian
interest rates and nervousness on the future of the North American Free
Trade Agreement, have pushed the Canadian dollar down sharply over the past
two days.
The currency was trading at 76.47 US cents yesterday morning, compared to
more than 77 cents on Monday.
The Bank of Canada's efforts to bring down interest rates are expected to
keep a lid on the dollar in coming weeks. The gap between the yield on
10-year US and Canadian government bonds shrunk yesterday to about 1.1
percentage points, compared to 1.4 points before Canada's general election
on October 25. Canadian banks earlier this week lowered their prime lending
rate to 5.5 per cent, the lowest in 31 years.
Federal and provincial budget projections have been thrown off course
largely by sluggish tax revenues, rather than runaway spending. The revenue
shortfalls are ascribed partly to slow economic growth. But there is also
growing evidence of an expanding black economy.
