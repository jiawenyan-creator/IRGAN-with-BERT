ACTION:

 Notice of reserve release; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces the release of that portion of the 1994 Pacific whiting (whiting) harvest guideline that will not be
used by shoreside processors by the end of the year. The released amount is available for harvest by all U.S. fishing
vessels, whether delivering shoreside or at sea. This action is intended to assure full utilization of the whiting
resource, as authorized by the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP).

<DATE>
DATES:

 Effective 0001 hours local time October 1, 1994, through December 31, 1994 (2400 hours local time). Comments will

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The regulations at 50 CFR 663.23(b)(4) allocate whiting in 19941996 between fishing vessels that deliver
at sea (catcher/processors and catcher boats delivering to motherships) and those that deliver shoreside (59 FR
17491, April 13, 1994). When 60 percent of the annual harvest guideline is taken, further at-sea processing is prohibited,
and the remaining 40 percent is reserved for use by vessels delivering shoreside. The portion of the harvest guideline
that the shoreside sector will not use by the end of the year will be made available for harvest by all fishing vessels,
whether delivering shoreside or at sea, by August 15 or as soon as practicable thereafter. Whiting may be released
at a later date if it becomes apparent that shore-based needs have been substantially over-estimated (50 CFR 663.23(b)(4)(ii)).



The amount of whiting available for release is determined by the Regional Director, based on estimates of actual and
projected amounts of whiting harvested, using state catch and landings data, the survey of domestic processing capacity
and intent, testimony received at Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) meetings, and/or other relevant
information. 
In 1994, the whiting harvest guideline is 260,000 mt. Of this, 104,000 mt was set aside as a reserve for shoreside processing.
At-sea processing of whiting was prohibited on May 13, 1994, when 60 percent (156,000 mt) of the harvest guideline
was projected to be reached. 
During the last week of July, 1994, the Regional Director reviewed catch and landings data provided by the States of
Washington, Oregon, and California; surveyed shore-based fishing and processing representatives; and consulted
with the three States in determining the amount of whiting expected to be processed shoreside for the remainder of
the year. Approximately 62,000 mt of whiting were projected to remain in the harvest guideline after August 1, 1994.
An estimated 35,500 mt had been delivered shoreside by August 1. Additional shore-based fishing and processing effort
entered the fishery late in July, and an additional 41,00072,000 mt were estimated to be needed by the shore-based
sector through the end of 1994. Based on this information, the Regional Director determined that the shore-based
industry could use the remainder of the harvest guideline, and no whiting was made available for at-sea processing
on August 15. The Council concurred with this determination, and agreed that progress of the shore-based fishery
should be reevaluated in September 1994, and any surplus whiting released on or near October 1, 1994.
The States and industry were contacted again in late September, 1994 to determine the shore-based sector's use of
whiting for the remainder of 1994. Whiting had become less available to the fishery in September and catch rates were
lower than in earlier projections. Based on the most recent week's catch rate (389 mt/day applied through November
15, 1994) and interest of some operations to continue to the end of the year, the Regional Director has determined that,
of the 38,000 mt of the harvest guideline remaining after September 25, 1994, 16,000 mt are available for release to
all vessels on October 1, 1994. The remaining 22,000 mt are in reserve for shore-based processing.
After October 1, 1994, shore-based landings of whiting will be deducted first from the reserve for shore-based processing.
When the shoreside reserve is taken, shoreside deliveries will be deducted from the portion of the harvest guideline
that was released for harvest by all vessels. When the released amount is reached, or projected to be reached, further
at-sea processing will be prohibited. When the harvest guideline is reached, a 10,000 lb (4536 kg) trip limit will
be imposed, allowing landings only of whiting caught incidentally or in the small fresh and bait fisheries (as authorized
at 50 CFR 663.23(b)(3)(i) and (c)(1)(i)(I), and at 59 FR 685 (January 6, 1994)). 


Secretarial Action


For the reasons stated above, the Regional Director announces that, at 0001 hours local time October 1, 1994, an additional
16,000 mt of Pacific whiting are made available for harvest by all fishing vessels. When this amount is reached, further
at-sea processing will be prohibited, according to the procedures at 50 CFR 663.23(b)(4)(iv).


Classification


The determination to take this action is based on the most recent data available. 
This action is taken under the authority of 50 CFR 663.23(b)(4) and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866.
