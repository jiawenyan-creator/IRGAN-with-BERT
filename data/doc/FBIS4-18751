  [Text] Brussels, April 11 (AFP) -- Two surgical teams were 
to fly out for Kigali on Monday [11 April], the Belgian Red 
Cross said Sunday. 
  The two surgical teams, one from the Belgian Red Cross and 
the other from the International Committee of the Red Cross were 
to be flown aboard a specially chartered Boeing 707, initially 
to the Red Cross logistical base in Bujumbura, the capital of 
neighbouring Burundi. 
  From there, the teams and medical equipment would be taken 
by 
road to Kigali where four days of ethnic violence between Hutus 
and Tutsis has claimed at least 1,000 lives.
