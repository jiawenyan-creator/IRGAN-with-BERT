FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Reduced interest payments help lift BDM 69%
to Pounds 4.2m
A STEEP FALL in interest payments following flotation early last year helped
to boost pre-tax profits at British Data Management by 69 per cent to Pounds
4.22m (Pounds 2.51m) for the year ended June 30.
Operating profits at the specialist data storage group were ahead 24 per
cent at Pounds 4.45m (Pounds 3.59m) on turnover up at Pounds 15.6m (Pounds
13m).
Interest payments fell to Pounds 224,000 from Pounds 1.08m previously. Net
borrowings, which were around Pounds 10m before the flotation, were Pounds
5m at the year end, giving the company a 30 per cent gearing.
The pre-tax profits were also helped by a low tax charge following
over-provision in previous years.
Mr Stephen Crown, chairman and chief executive, described the first full
year as a listed company as 'particularly exciting.' Three commercial data
management businesses had been acquired for a total outlay of Pounds 3.5m.
This had added 225 customers, taking the total to 1,200.
BDM is the UK market leader in data storage for the oil and gas industry.
The group commissioned a second data centre in Aberdeen after winning a
contract to manage BP Exploration's library and records centre. It was
opened last week by Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister.
Mr Crown said that more companies seeking to concentrate on their core
activities would be looking outside for data management. 'We can take away
the hassle of filing.'
In addition there was plenty of potential for contracts from Government and
the National Health Service.
BSS, the division which makes specialist racking systems, had had a
'fantastic year,' said Mr Crown, boosting its contribution to group
operating profit by 55 per cent on turnover ahead 24 per cent.
Turnover at Eurocrate, which supplies the removals industry with plastic
crates, was ahead 16 per cent - the first rise for three years.
The group's earnings per share were 14.3p, up from a previous 11.9p. The
final dividend proposed is 3.25p, giving a total of 4.75p for the year
compared with a notional 4p given in last year's prospectus.
