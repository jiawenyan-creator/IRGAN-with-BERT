DR. NEIL SOLOMON; 
CHOLESTEROL AND FAT 
Question: I've followed your advice about reading labels on the food I buy, and 
it's really been a valuable piece of advice. 
But sometimes I'm not clear about what the label is telling me. For example, if 
a label says the food does not have cholesterol, does that mean it doesn't have 
much saturated fat? 
Answer: A cholesterol-free food can be either high or low in saturated fat.
