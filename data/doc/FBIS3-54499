  [Text] Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, chairman of the 
Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq [SAIRI], has 
reaffirmed the need to deploy UN observers in southern Iraq to 
prevent the regime from using heavy weapons against the 
civilians and to supervise the aid programs there. 
  In an interview with the Austrian Broadcasting Company, 
al-Hakim also affirmed the need to send observers and inspection 
teams to investigate conditions inside prisons and detention 
centers, and issues connected with human rights in Iraq. 
  Referring to the deteriorating conditions in the southern 
marshlands that the regime is draining, al-Hakim said returning 
life to normal in these areas has become an urgent need, 
stressing that the United Nations must open gaps in the huge 
earthen dams that the regime has built to cut off water to the 
region. All indications are that these dams are meant to kill 
the people and destroy their livelihood. 
  Al-Hakim stressed that these areas are witnessing tragic 
conditions. The regime has imposed an economic blockade on 
them, preventing food and medical supplies from reaching the 
inhabitants. The regime is also draining the marshlands, forcing 
the inhabitants to emigrate en masse to Iran and to other areas 
in Iraq. 
  Al-Hakim said the regime has not been content with these 
measures. It is also carrying out widespread searches in rural 
towns and villages, and is arresting citizens and torturing them 
to extract confessions on the activists opposed to the tyrant 
Saddam. 
  Answering a question on the goals of the Islamic Resistance 
in southern Iraq, al-Hakim said the Resistance's target is not 
the Iraqi Army because many of the army's personnel do not 
sympathize with the regime. The Resistance is chasing and 
killing the wicked elements who are trying to involve the army 
in the fight. It is also destroying the heavy weapons used by 
the regime to kill civilians.
