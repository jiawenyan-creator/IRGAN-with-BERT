S. AFRICA TALKS TO MANDELA ABOUT HOW TO FREE HIM WITHOUT TRIGGERING RIOTS 
The government is talking to jailed black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela 
about ways to effect his release without triggering bloody riots, Information 
Minister Christoffel van der Merwe said Friday. 
In a statement carried by the independent South African Press Assn., Van der 
Merwe said, "The situation that could lead to Mr. Mandela's release is being 
discussed with him, and it is being discussed in government circles." 
He added that he could not promise that Mandela, leader of South Africa's 
outlawed African National Congress, would be freed this year, however. 
Mandela, 70, was jailed for life in 1964 for sabotage and plotting to overthrow 
the country's white-led minority government. 
"If we just released him today . . . it would undoubtedly have the result that 
people would get killed. We have to create a situation where that will not be 
the result," Van der Merwe said. 
The minister declined to say why he believes Mandela's release would cause 
riots and deaths. 
Van der Merwe said Justice Minister Hendrik J. Coetsee, who is known to get on 
well with Mandela, is seeking his cooperation to avoid bloodshed after his 
release. 
Mandela's lawyer, Ismail Ayob, said it is absurd to suggest that releasing his 
client would cause deaths and said he was not aware of discussions with the 
government. 
"I think they are just looking for excuses yet again not to release Mandela. 
There would be a great outpouring of joy at his release after serving two or 
three life sentences, but I cannot imagine why even one person would die," Ayob 
said. 
"Mr. Mandela is not in jail anymore; he is in detention," Van der Merwe said. 
Mandela's wife, Winnie, said earlier this year that he was more isolated and 
lonely in the comfortable prison house he now inhabits than he had ever been in 
jail.
