  [Text] Santiago, 1 May (EFE) -- United Labor Confederation 
(CUT) Chairman Manuel Bustos today asked the government to grant 
the labor movement a real chance of participating in the 
decisionmaking process of those measures that affect workers. 
  Addressing a CUT rally held to commemorate International 
Labor Day that was unable to attract a large audience -- it was 
attended by no more than 4,000 people -- Bustos said: "It is 
not enough for us to be questioned and to be heard if our 
opinions are not taken into account." 
  The majority of those who attended the rally are members of 
the unions dominated by the Communist Party [PCCh] who arrived 
at the rally held on Avenue General Velasquez, located in the 
western section of Santiago, after attending an unauthorized 
march in an area of Santiago. 
  The PCCh, which Bustos has charged is trying to divide the 
CUT, built its own podium, from which its leaders criticized the 
CUT leadership headed by Bustos. The PCCh leaders also charged 
Bustos with being a government tool and with disavowing the 
claims of Chilean workers. 
  This situation caused some minor incidents, unlike what 
occurred one week ago when a CUT congress ended with fist fights 
among representatives of different CUT factions. 
  In his speech, Manuel Bustos harshly criticized Education 
Minister Ernesto Schiefelbein, whom he charged with being 
responsible for a labor conflict with teachers, as a result of 
which 120,000 teachers will hold a national strike on 18 May to 
demand legal reforms and better salaries. 
  Labor Minister Jorge Arrate, who is a Socialist, addressed 
the rally on behalf of the government. He said that the 
government will not practice demagoguery or create "the 
illusion" of approving salaries higher than those allowed by the 
country's economic situation.
