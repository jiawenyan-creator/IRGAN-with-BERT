FT  20 NOV 93 / US trade deficit widens
THE faster pace of US economic growth is leading to a wider trade deficit,
figures yesterday indicated.
The Commerce Department reported an increase in the trade deficit to Dollars
10.9bn (Pounds 7.3bn) in September against Dollars 10bn in August. The
shortfall was higher than analysts expected but fell well short of the
Dollars 12.1bn deficit registered in June, the largest deficit to be seen in
recent months.
The higher deficit reflected a 3.5 per cent monthly rise in imports to
Dollars 49.8bn, which more than offset a 2.1 per cent increase in exports to
Dollars 38.9bn. For the first three quarters, imports were up 9.5 from the
same period last year against a rise in exports of 3.1 per cent.
In its latest forecast for the US economy, out this week, the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development projected a current account
deficit of Dollars 107bn this year, rising to Dollars 135bn, or 2 per cent
of gross domestic product, next year. The external deficit was Dollars 66bn
last year.
The rise in the US trade deficit mainly reflects faster economic growth in
the US than in most overseas markets, especially Japan and Europe. Many
forecasters predict US growth at 4 per cent a year or more this quarter.
There is little sign of any erosion of American export competitiveness.
In the first three quarters, US exports to Asian newly-industrialising
economies rose 10 per cent relative to the same period last year. US exports
to the European Community were down but that mainly reflected the weakness
of European demand.
