SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Title III of the Export Trading Company Act of 1982 (15 U.S.C. 400121) authorizes the Secretary of Commerce
to issue Export Trade Certificates of Review. A Certificate of Review protects the holder and the members identified

actions for the export conduct specified in the Certificate and carried out in compliance with its terms and conditions.
Section 302(b)(1) of the Act and 15 CFR 325.6(a) require the Secretary to publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 identifying the applicant and summarizing its proposed export conduct.
