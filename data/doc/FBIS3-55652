  [Excerpts] Moscow, 10 Jan -- The main task of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS], set up by a presidential 
edict to replace the former Security Ministry, is to prevent 
foreign special services from carrying out subversive activity 
against Russia. [passage omitted] 
  A number of subunits of the [former] Security Ministry have 
been transferred to the Federal Agency for Government 
Communications and to the directorate for protection of the 
government. 
  Unlike the Security Ministry, which was subordinated to both 
the president and the government, the FCS is subordinated 
directly to the Russian president. 
  A special attestation commission now working in the FCS will 
spend one month reassessing staff, Sergey Stepashin [deputy FCS 
director] said. The central apparatus will be reduced from 
3,500 to 1,500 employees. Sergey Stepashin said that, in a 
conversation with him, Yeltsin asked not for purges during the 
reorganization process but for selection of staff on the basis 
of professionalism, loyalty, and willingness to serve the 
country and state. Staff members who do not pass the 
attestation will not end up without a job, Sergey Stepashin 
said, but will be able to transfer to the Interior Ministry, the 
tax inspectorate or the general procuracy.
