FT  14 SEP 92 / International Company News: Sabena plans to cut 1,000 more
jobs
SABENA, Belgium's state-owned airline, is planning to cut a further 1,000
jobs on top of the 2,200 redundancies already planned as part of its
two-year restructuring programme.
Some 37.6 per cent of the airline is now owned by Air France, the French
state airline.
The European Commission announced last week that its merger control
authorities would examine the Air France deal over the next month.
If they still have 'serious doubts' about the effect of the deal on
competition in the EC after four weeks they could open an in-depth inquiry
lasting up to four months.
Sabena-Air France is only the second airline deal to be examined under the
EC's two-year-old merger regulation.
In the only other case - the sale of Pan Am's assets to Delta Air Lines -
the commission gave the go-ahead after the one-month preliminary
investigation.
Announcing a new frequent flyer programme recently, Mr Pierre Godfroid,
Sabena's chairman, said he expected the airline to break even by the end of
the year, despite the group's operating loss of BFr300m in the first half of
1992.
