  [Text] The Labor Party convention approved by a large 
majority the ministers' compromise proposal on the national 
health reform bill after a tense debate in which Health Minister 
Ramon did not announce his resignation. The voting was 
conducted by a show of hands after convention chairman Minister 
David Liba'i called for a preliminary vote to halt the debate in 
order to conduct the final vote. 
  The convention was opened by Prime Minister Rabin, who 
explained the significance of the amendments required in the 
bill. The ministers' compromise proposal calls for returning 
the original bill to the government for amendments, after which 
it is to be submitted to the Knesset. 
  In his speech, Minister Hayim Ramon harshly criticized the 
compromise proposal for the national health reform bill, but 
contrary to expectations, he did not announce his resignation. 
In his speech Ramon reviewed the history of the bill and 
accused the party apparatus and officials of emptying the 
original bill of its content. Our correspondents Sheli 
Yehimovich and Shmu'el Tal note that Minister Ramon's speech was 
constantly disrupted until at times he could hardly speak. 
Ramon called on the convention to reject the compromise 
proposal. 
  Prime Minister Rabin reacted to Minister Ramon's criticism. 
He was followed by Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili. The 
debate ended with the vote, which approved the compromise 
proposal of the ministers against the wishes of Minister Ramon. 
  In a news conference held after the convention, Minister 
Ramon said he will submit his resignation when the amended bill 
is submitted to the Knesset.
