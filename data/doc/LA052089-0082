IRAN'S SECURITY FORCES KILL 20 IN DRUG GANG 
Iranian security forces killed more than 20 drug smugglers this week in a clash 
with a heavily armed gang in the border region of Sistan and Baluchistan in 
southeast Iran, Tehran Radio reported Friday. 
More than a ton of opium extract was seized, as well as grenade launchers and 
other weapons, it said. 
Iran has executed more than 500 traffickers this year in a campaign to halt the 
influx of drugs from Afghanistan and Pakistan. Some are sold to Iran's 
estimated 1 million addicts, but most are shipped on to Europe through Turkey.
