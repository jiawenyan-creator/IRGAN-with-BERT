  [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- There will be no mass 
action by the Witwatersrand branch of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] Youth Brigade in central Johannesburg until after the 
election, Branch Publicity Secretary Mandlakayise Magubane said 
on Tuesday [19 April] night. 
  Speaking after a meeting of the group's leaders in 
Johannesburg, he said the organisation would now dedicate itself 
to campaigning for the election "right up to the last minute". 
"Although we are not happy with the fact that the poll date 
will not be postponed, we are going to do our best to win the 
election," he said. 
  He appealed to all former IFP supporters who had joined 
other 
political parties "just so they could take part in the voting 
process" to come back into the IFP fold. 
  Businessmen and workers in central Johannesburg have been 
concerned since last week that there would be an IFP march 
though the centre of Johannesburg coupled with stayaways 
threatened by the Youth Brigade. "We have stopped all rolling 
mass action to concentrate on the election," Mr Magubane said.
