A CAMPUS GARDEN THAT JUST WENT TO POT 
Something has been growing in the Organic Gardens on the campus of Cal State 
Long Beach that isn't the normal squash, green beans and sunflowers. 
Someone has been growing marijuana plants, according to the university police. 
Campus police arrested a man identified as Ramon Sala, 50, on suspicion of 
cultivating marijuana. Sala, who was booked at the Sheriff's Department 
Lakewood substation, is free on $1,000 bail. 
Cultivation of marijuana is a felony and carries a maximum sentence of three 
years in state prison. 
Police conducted an investigation after an anonymous caller tipped the office 
of university President Curtis McCray that marijuana was growing in the 
gardens. 
Public Safety Sgt. Jerry Prieto arrested Sala, who was seen leaving the gardens 
carrying "a leafy plant about two feet high," said Toni Beron, university 
public affairs director. 
Sala threw the plant under a nearby vehicle and asked, "What marijuana?" before 
Prieto could say anything, Beron said. 
A search of the gardens failed to turn up more marijuana, but it appeared that 
five to six plants may have been removed from the area, Beron said. 
The gardens at Bellflower Boulevard and State University Drive are rented to 
the public to grow vegetables and fruit. 
Beron said there has been no previous problem with marijuana in the gardens.
