ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed rule would amend existing regulations governing the Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) program
to establish performance standards against which lender and holder default rates would be measured, as mandated
by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992. The proposal also amends the regulations to reflect
various statutory provisions related to HEAL performance standards for schools, lenders, and holders, including
the following: The formula for calculating default rates; the requirement that certain schools develop default
management plans; the borrower's option to reduce his or her insurance premium by obtaining a credit worthy cosigner;
the waiver of penalty fees for schools, lenders, and holders with a low volume of loans; and the option to pay off defaulted
loans to reduce default rates.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 707(a) of the Public Health Service Act (the Act) requires that, not later than 1 year after enactment of the
Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102408), the Secretary shall establish
performance standards for lenders and holders of HEAL loans, including fees to be imposed for failing to meet such
standards. In the report accompanying Public Law 102408, the Congress stated that it expects ``***
schools, lenders, and holders to assume and share the responsibility for minimizing HEAL defaults ***''
(Conference Report 102925, p. 112).


In accordance with the above, this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposes to amend the HEAL regulations to
establish performance standards for lenders and holders of HEAL loans. Under this proposal, the Secretary would
establish requirements and fees to be imposed on a HEAL lender or holder based on the lender or holder's HEAL default
rate. The default rate for lenders and holders would be calculated in accordance with the statutory default formula
set forth in section 719(5) of the Act, except that loans made to students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs) prior to the end of the first 3 years that the lender/holder performance standard is in effect would be excluded
from the default rate calculation. The proposed performance standard requirements, including the risk-based fee
to be assessed on each lender and holder, are described below.
In developing these proposals, the Department has relied heavily on section 708 of the Act, which sets forth fees and
performance requirements for HEAL schools with default rates greater than 5 percent. Schools, lenders, and holders
all play a significant role in helping to assure the collectibility of HEAL loans, and all benefit from participation
in the HEAL program. Accordingly, this approach is designed to assure similar measures of accountability for all
parties involved in the HEAL program.
This proposal also clarifies various statutory provisions related to HEAL performance standards for schools, lenders,
and holders, including the following: (1) The formula for calculating default rates; (2) the requirement that certain
schools develop default management plans; (3) the borrower's option to reduce his or her insurance premium by obtaining
a credit worthy cosigner; (4) the waiver of penalty fees for schools, lenders, and holders with a low volume of loans;
and (5) the option to pay off defaulted loans to reduce default rates. The specific amendments proposed are described
below according to the subparts, section numbers, and headings of the HEAL regulations affected.
