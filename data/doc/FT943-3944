FT  12 SEP 94 / Teenagers 'still opt for traditional jobs'
Teenagers are still opting for jobs traditionally associated with a
particular gender and are satisfied with the government's Youth Training
scheme, says the independent Policy Studies Institute.
An institute report, published today, says that more than half of young
women employees surveyed and over three-quarters of female trainees had
chosen occupations such as office work, hairdressing and caring.
More than half of young men asked were entering fields such as construction,
engineering or computing.
Ms Catherine Shaw, a research fellow at the institute and author of the
report, said: 'It is surprising to find, in the mid-1990s, so many young
women still either choosing or being directed towards traditional and, in
many cases, low-paid occupations.'
More than one-in-three young men said they never did any cleaning, cooking
or shopping for food.
The report is the second in a series examining a large group of 16- and
17-year-olds from six inner city areas. About half those surveyed are from
ethnic minorities.
Other findings include:
More than 80 per cent of YT trainees are satisfied with the training and
optimistic about job prospects.
Three-quarters of the sample were still in full-time education. Nearly half
of those taking A-levels were finding their courses more difficult than they
expected.
