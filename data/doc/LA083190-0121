IBM Plans Price Hike: International Business Machines Corp. said it would raise 
prices on many of its products sold in the United States by 4%, effective Jan. 
1. The price change will not affect prices or price changes announced after 
June 1, 1990, IBM said. Among other items excluded from the increase are IBM's
