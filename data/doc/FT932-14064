FT  21 APR 93 / Arabs to decide on peace talks
Arab delegations meeting in Damascus are expected to announce today whether
to resume the stalled peace talks with Israel, Reuter reports from Damascus.
Syria's foreign minister Farouq al-Shara said last night after dinner with
counterparts from Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt and the foreign affairs chief of
the Palestine Liberation Organisation that the statement would be
'positive'. The Palestinians have been split over the talks, which had been
scheduled to resume in Washington yesterday.
