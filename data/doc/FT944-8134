FT  22 NOV 94 / Spring suggested for Irish PM
Labour the junior coalition party, which felled Mr Albert Reynolds' Irish
government last week, yesterday suggested its leader, Mr Dick Spring, should
be prime minister. Holding the balance of power between parties that cannot
rule alone, Labour wants to capitalise on new popularity brought about by
its decision to sink Mr Reynolds in a row over handling of an extradition
case. Opinion polls show it is now the second most popular party behind
Fianna Fail, which chose acting finance minister Bertie Ahern to replace Mr
Reynolds as its leader. Public approval of Mr Spring has shot up.
'Spring is an outstanding statesman. Few in this country would not share the
view that he would make an excellent Taoiseach (prime minister),' said Mr
Brendan Howlin, who represented Labour in the last cabinet as health
minister. Political commentators expect most or all of Ireland's parties to
propose their leaders for the premiership today. Mr Howlin's comments were a
strong indication that Labour may pursue a demand for Mr Spring to be prime
minister when the horse-trading between parties gets under way later this
week. Mr Ahern said he expected the formation of a new government to take
around two weeks.
