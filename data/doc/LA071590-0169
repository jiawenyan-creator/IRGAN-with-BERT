BETTING WITH BOB; 
MAN VS. MICROCHIP 
Once again, I bet one of SURELOCK's turf races and lost while the silicon 
sleuth won. The computer played straight bets while I went for an exacta, 
losing $20. 
My bets for today are $9 triples from Bright and Right and Danawee Prospector 
in the first race to Gunmetal, Burgundy Bonus and Remar in the second to Far 
Out Star in the third. 
Bob's Saturday Bankroll: $1,691 
Saturday's Loss: $20 
Current Bankroll: $1,671 
SURELOCK's $40 win and $40 place bets on Green's Leader in the ninth race 
returned a profit of $84, giving it its biggest overall lead of the meeting -- 
$141.50. 
Its bets today are a $10 exacta box of Burgundy Bonus and Benedict's Printz in 
the second race, a $10 exacta box of Miserden and Advocate Training and $20 to 
win and place on Miserden in the ninth race. 
Computer's Sat. Bankroll: $1,728.50
