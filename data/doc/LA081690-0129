COMMUNITY DIGEST: SANTA FE SPRINGS; 
PLANNER APPOINTED TO FILL LATE COUNCILMAN'S TERM 
The City Council unanimously selected Amat Barcelon to serve the remaining two 
years of the council term of Larry Sandoval, who recently died of a heart 
attack. 
The council could have called a special election to fill Sandoval's seat. 
But as in similar instances in the past, it opted Monday night to appoint a 
replacement. Sandoval first became a council member when he was appointed to 
succeed Councilman Armando Mora, who died in 1985. 
A 38-year resident of Santa Fe Springs, Barcelon has been a member of the 
Planning Commission since 1986 and is chairman of the Heritage Artwork in 
Public Places Advisory Committee. 
Barcelon, 64, retired from Rockwell International Corp. four years ago after a 
27-year career, during which he worked as a contract and operations 
administrator. A World War II infantry veteran, Barcelon was wounded in April, 
1945, and received a medical discharge in 1946. He and his wife of 38 years 
have two grown daughters and a grandson. 
Barcelon graduated with a bachelor's degree in business management in 1951 from 
Woodbury College in Los Angeles.
