RECOGNIZING YOUNG ARTISTS 
Two separate events on Thursday recognized the work of young artists. The 
Pepsi-Cola Co., in announcing renovation of 10 neighborhood parks in the 
county, chose 31 winning posters by children ages 5 to 12 depicting the 
artists' designs for a park. At the city's Junior Arts Center at 4800 Hollywood 
Blvd., a exhibit of the top 48 entries in McDonald's Hispanic Heritage Art 
Contest opened. The free exhibit will be on display through Oct. 8, when it 
goes on tour to other cities.
