FT  03 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM seeks to calm backbench jitters
MR JOHN MAJOR last night sought to calm the nerves of backbench Conservative
MPs with a prediction that the government's economic strategy would deliver
permanent control of inflation.
Acknowledging the unease among some of his supporters, the prime minister
admitted that the pace of economic recovery had been disappointing. But he
warned that a relaxation of the government's anti-inflationary stance would
jeopardise the prospect of 'stable prices' during the present parliament
He underlined also his anger with those Tories - including Baroness Thatcher
 -who believed that Britain could reject the Maastricht treaty on European
economic and political union.
Setting out his domestic policy objectives, the prime minister promised
'radical' legislation to tackle the problems of inner-city schools and a
campaign to spread the benefits of the Conservative 'revolution' to the less
affluent.
He called for a determined efforts by the party to capitalise on Labour
disarray by rebuilding support in those areas - including Scotland, Wales
and the south-west - where it had failed to win majorities at the general
election.
For the short term, however, Mr Major warned that the sharp rise in public
borrowing foreshadowed a 'tough and difficult' round of public spending
negotiations.
