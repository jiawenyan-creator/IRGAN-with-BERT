FT  24 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market report
THE LONDON Metal Exchange ZINC market's cash premium shrank again yesterday
as the three months position built on Monday's rally and the cash price
edged down further. Dealers said a comparatively small rise in LME warehouse
stocks encouraged the three months position's Dollars 7 rise to Dollars
1,210.50 a tonne. That left the cash premium at Dollars 82 a tonne. Before
last week's LME move to impose a descending ceiling on the daily cash
premium a technical squeeze had widened the cash/three months premium to
Dollars 189 a tonne. In the LME TIN market the recent sustained price rise,
which had added Dollars 287.50 a tonne to the three months price in seven
trading days, was halted. But buying support appeared as the Dollars 6,700 a
tonne level was approached and the price closed off the low at Dollars
6,735.50 a tonne, down Dollars 32 on the day. A decline in warehouse stocks
helped to steady the market, traders said. In the London bullion market GOLD
resumed its recent uptrend with a Dollars 2.05 gain to Dollars 344.65 an
ounce. Dealers attributed the rise to light professional activity encouraged
by concern over the political situation in South Africa, the largest gold
producing country.
