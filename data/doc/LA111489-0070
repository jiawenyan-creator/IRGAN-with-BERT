SUNNI MUSLIM A VOICE FOR MODERATION IN LEBANON 
Salim Hoss, a Sunni Muslim who has been a voice of moderation through 14 years 
of civil war in Lebanon, returns to the prime minister's office for the fourth 
time in 13 years to try to end the fighting. 
The 59-year-old economist is a firm backer of democracy, a free-wheeling 
economy and Christian-Muslim coexistence. He is married to a Christian. 
Hoss' main asset is the wide respect he commands among both Christians and 
Muslims. 
His previous tenure in office began June 2, 1987, a day after Prime Minister 
Rashid Karami was assassinated. 
Trained as an economist at the American University of Beirut, Hoss obtained a 
doctorate in economics and business administration from Indiana University in 
1959. 
The tall, balding, bespectacled Hoss does not smoke or drink and normally goes 
to bed early. He prefers Oriental food and likes to spend evenings listening to 
classical music.
