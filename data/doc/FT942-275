FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: SocGen sees profit level
maintained
Net profit at Societe Generale, the French banking group, this year should
at least match the level achieved in 1993, but the growth rate will slow, Mr
Marc Vienot, chief executive officer, said, Reuter reports from New York.
He declined to project profits. SocGen earned FFr3.61bn (Dollars 640m) in
1993 against FFr3.28bn in 1992. Mr Vienot expects a lower loan-loss
provision in 1994. SocGen's loan-loss provision rose in 1993 to FFr7.21bn
from FFr6.26bn in 1992.
Domestic or classical banking activities 'have not done badly' in the first
six months, in spite of somewhat weak credit demand since most French
corporations have enough cash to finance expansion without borrowing, he
said.
The pace of new activity in consumer credit in the first six months has been
close to twice that in the same period a year ago and the pace of new
mortgage activity is up 35-40 per cent from a year ago, he said.
