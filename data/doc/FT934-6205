FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: MIM swaps zinc smelter interest
MIM Holdings, the Australian metals group, and Germany's Metallgesellschaft,
which holds a 14.9 per cent stake in MIM, are negotiating to swap interests
in two loss-making German zinc smelters which they currently own on a joint
basis.
Under the restructuring plan, MIM would acquire the 50 per cent interest
which the German company holds in MHD 'Berzelius' Duisburg. This would give
the Australian group full ownership of the Duisburg operation, which also
takes in Rhine-Zink, a downstream product-manufacturing operation. The
capacity at the smelter is around 100,000 tonnes.
Conversely, Metallgesellschaft would acquire MIM's 50 per cent interest in
Ruhr-Zink, also achieving outright ownership. Capacity there is around
170,000 tonnes.
As a further element in the package, the German group would buy from MIM a
25 per cent stake in Metallgesellschaft Ltd, the London-based brokerage,
lifting its stake to around 86 per cent. MIM would continue to own about 9
per cent and have board representation.
In Brisbane, MIM said that there might be some additional cash adjustment
when the restructuring deal was finalised, hopefully by the end of 1993, but
declined to give details at this stage.
It said that both groups were unhappy at the losses being made at the
smelters, and claimed that the deal 'should improve the positions for both
parties'. The restructuring will mean that MIM acquires full ownership of a
second European zinc smelter using the Imperial Smelting Process (ISP), in a
matter of months.
Only a few weeks ago, the Australian company completed the purchase of the
Avonmouth zinc smelter from Pasminco, where it has since announced
redundancies in an effort to boost cost-efficiency.
Although there has been talk of reducing zinc smelter capacity in Europe,
MIM made clear yesterday that it intends to operate both smelters.
