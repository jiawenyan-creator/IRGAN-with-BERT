FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: More cash-backed BES - At a Glance
Another round of university property cash-backed business expansion schemes
was launched this week. Accumulus Hallam, raising money for Sheffield Hallam
University, has a contracted exit price, after five years, of 122p for every
100p invested. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. The Cambridge Collegiate
Consortium offers a contracted exit price of 117p after five years, with a
minimum investment of Pounds 2,000.
The Oxford Colleges BES is another cash backed scheme, offering an exit
price of 117p for 100p invested, or 99p if a commitment is made before July
19. Cheques can be post-dated to August 20 and the minimum investment is
Pounds 3,000. Shares in Oriel Cash Backed, another Oxford college scheme,
sold out within four days, so the sponsors are now launching Oriel IV, an
identical scheme offering a contracted exit price of Pounds 1.21.
