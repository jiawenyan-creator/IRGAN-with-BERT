  [Text] The five-week long joint exercise by the special 
forces of Pakistan and the United States begins today. It is to 
be conducted on the high mountain range north of Peshawar in the 
North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan. Special forces are 
commandos trained in paratrooping skills and swift decisive 
action behind enemy lines. 
  Defense experts feel that the joint exercises pose a threat 
to Indian positions on Siachen. The experts also say that the 
joint naval and military exercises with littoral states in the 
Indian Ocean have become a means for the perpetuation of U.S. 
military presence in the region.
