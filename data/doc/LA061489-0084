METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WATER DISTRICT CHIEF GETS $12,000 RAISE 
The director of the Metropolitan Water District in Los Angeles received a 
$12,000 raise Tuesday, bringing his yearly pay to $170,000 -- the highest 
salary for a public official in the county. 
The water district board approved the raise for General Manager Carl Boronkay 
in a motion made by Organizational and Personnel Committee Chairman Ken Witt, 
heading off an earlier plan by the committee to give the director a $17,000 
boost in pay. 
Many of those who voted against the $12,000 raise had actually been in favor of 
the larger increase, MWD spokesman Jay Malinowski said. 
Mayor Tom Bradley called Boronkay's salary "outrageous," but Malinowski 
defended it. By comparison, Bradley earns $97,654 annually and Clifton Moore, 
director of the Department of Airports -- who is the highest paid Los Angeles 
city official -- makes $153,927.
