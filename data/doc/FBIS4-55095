  [Text] Warsaw, May 7 (CTK) -- Trade and Industry Minister 
Vladimir Dlouhy today called naive some parts of yesterday's 
declaration on East-West trade, when he addressed the 3rd 
conference of G7 and E10 groups. The declaration was adopted 
yesterday by businessmen from the world's seven most advanced 
countries (G7) and ten central and Eastern European 
post-communist countries (Belarus, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Kazakhstan, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia and 
Ukraine) at an East-West economic forum held within the 
conference. 
  Dlouhy criticised the document also because it opens up the 
door to all foreign investment irrespective of whether or not it 
benefits the receiver partner and accelerates the development of 
the local producer, brings new know-how to the receiver country 
and improves its budget. 
  Just as in an interview for CTK yesterday, Dlouhy dismissed 
"placing all post-communist countries under one umbrella" as 
well as discussing conditions of economic growth in countries 
which have not laid and stabilised the foundations of market 
economy.
