  [Text] Cairo, 2 Jun (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
expressed his deep concern at today's Israeli raid on Lebanon. 
He noted that Lebanon's sovereignty must be respected and any 
violation thereof is unacceptable. 
  In remarks he made this evening, Musa added that the raid 
could negatively affect the peace process, noting that such acts 
are not acceptable for dealing with the existing problems. The 
foreign minister emphasized that Egypt clearly stands for the 
protection of Lebanon's sovereignty and called on Israel to stop 
such actions. 
  Asked about Egypt's position regarding Lebanon's request to 
convene an urgent session of the Security Council to discuss the 
raid, Musa said that Lebanon naturally and undoubtedly has a 
right to make such request. 
  Asked about Israel's claim that the objectives of its raid 
are purely military and not political, Musa said: We are now 
talking about peace, not military objectives. He added: If we 
want to give impetus to the peace process and create an 
atmosphere of peace, such measures are uncalled for. 
  Asked if the nonaligned foreign ministers had discussed the 
raid, Musa said they had not, but it is possible that this issue 
may be raised at tomorrow's meetings.
