FT  25 AUG 93 / Channel tunnel rail link rethink
UNION RAILWAYS, the British Rail subsidiary responsible for the Channel
tunnel link, is investigating the feasibility of extending its tunnelling in
London should St Pancras Station be chosen as the terminus for the link,
Lisa Wood writes.
The study was in response to local protests over proposals, still being
considered, for trains to travel to St Pancras Station alongside the
existing North London line through Islington in north London, Union Railways
said.
It added that it would carry out a feasibility study of siting a tunnel
underneath the North London line, one of a number of options still being
considered.
