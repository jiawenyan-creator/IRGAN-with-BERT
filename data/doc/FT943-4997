FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional gain helps Peter Black rise to
Pounds 12.4m
An exceptional gain of Pounds 1.1m on the disposal of its Factory Shops
business helped to lift annual profits at Peter Black, supplier of footwear,
cosmetics and accessories to Marks and Spencer, by more than 36 per cent.
Pre-tax profits for the year to June 4 rose from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 12.4m
on sales 8 per cent ahead at Pounds 124.8m, compared with Pounds 114.9m.
Mr Gordon Black, joint chairman, said the sale of the retail and leisure
businesses had left the group both focused and ungeared. That, coupled with
its cash generating ability, would allow it to remain at the forefront of
the personal care and footwear industries, where there were clear prospects
for organic growth.
Operating profit from continuing operations improved from Pounds 9.16m to
Pounds 10.8m on turnover of Pounds 117.1m (Pounds 105.5m). Margins improved
from 8 to 9 per cent.
The personal care division lifted profits to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 4.4m) on
the back of a rise in turnover from Pounds 40.9m to Pounds 44.7m in markets
described by Mr Black as 'vibrant'.
English Grains, which supplies vitamins, dietary supplements and natural
medicines to multiple outlets and chemists, had a record year.
Mr Black said the group was constrained by lack of capacity in this market -
a situation that would change in 12 months' time when its new Pounds 10m
factory opens in Derbyshire.
Profits at the footwear and accessories division increased from Pounds 3.7m
to Pounds 4.6m on sales of Pounds 67.2m (Pounds 60.6m). The group is
confident that it can increase sales to M&amp;S, which has a relatively low
share of the footwear market.
Turnover from the group's discontinued retail and leisure operations was
Pounds 7.74m (Pounds 9.4m), with operating profits of Pounds 757,000 (Pounds
698,000).
The profit from the disposal of the Hornsea Freeport retail and leisure
division, sold after the year-end, will be in next year's accounts.
Earnings per share increased to 15.56p (11.18p) and the recommended final
dividend is lifted from 2.77p to 3.35p, giving a total for the year of 4.47p
(3.7p).
Analysts are expecting profits for this year to be just above Pounds 12m,
giving the group a prospective p/e of 19.
