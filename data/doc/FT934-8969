FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Drayton English net assets ahead
Drayton English and International Trust raised net asset value by 23 per
cent to 93.1p at October 5, against 75.5p six months earlier.
Net available revenue for the six months period fell from Pounds 172,000 to
Pounds 141,000 and earnings per share dropped to 0.3p (0.38p). Reflecting
the decline in dividend income and the relatively subdued prospects for
dividend growth over the next 12 months, the interim payment has been cut
from 0.6p to 0.4p.
