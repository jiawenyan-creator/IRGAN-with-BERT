FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Environmental Achievement 1993: A
wide cross section of green themes / Examining the quality - and the paucity
 -of the first recipients of environmental awards
THE inaugural winners of the Queen's Award for Environmental Achievement
represent a good cross-section of current green themes. They include
products or processes to clean up industrial effluents, reduce air pollution
from cars and boilers, fight the greenhouse effect by saving energy, save
the ozone layer by replacing CFCs, and cut the use of chemical pesticides.
All 12 winners clearly meet the main criterion laid down for the new award:
'a significant advance' offering 'major benefits in environmental terms
compared to existing products, technology or processes'.
They have also achieved commercial success - most spectacularly in the case
of Johnson Matthey's autocatalysts, which are world leaders in a global
market worth hundreds of millions of pounds a year.
Pilkington's energy-saving glass is also likely to be selling more than
Pounds 100m a year by the late 1990s.
The contribution that biotechnology can make to environmental improvement is
illustrated by the joint award to Agricultural Genetics Company and
Horticultural Research International, for developing biological alternatives
to chemical pesticides. It will be disappointing if future lists do not
include the direct application of biotechnology to clearing up toxic wastes
through 'bio-remediation' - developing microbes to convert pollutants into
harmless chemicals.
The awards also recognise environmental achievement in less glamorous fields
than biotechnology. For example Foseco's Foundry Division, based in
Tamworth, Staffordshire, has developed a portable, pollution-free foundry
for use by the aluminium industry. Metals feature too in the award to BEWT
(Water Engineers) for systems that recover metals from effluent solutions.
Replacement of CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons which are responsible for the ozone
hole in the upper atmosphere) features in two awards. The UK subsidiary of
Ricoh, the Japanese electronics group, has eliminated CFC cleaning fluids
from the production of selenium drums for photocopiers, by using ultra-pure
water at high pressure before coating the drums.
At the same time, Ricoh UK, based in Telford, Shropshire, is recycling
selenium (a toxic semi-metal) from used drums.
Kerry Ultrasonics of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, has developed a water-based
cleaning system to replace CFC solvents. The process, which covers all the
main industrial cleaning applications, uses ultrasound (at 40 KHz) in a
cleaning tank. This enables the fluid to reach small crevices in both sides
of a surface.
Sericol of Broadstairs, Kent, also won its award for moving to a water-based
system from organic solvents. Sericol, a subsidiary of Burmah Castrol, has a
range of water-based screen printing inks which avoid the emission of
volatile organic compounds associated with conventional screen inks. Screen
printers in the UK alone use 5,000 tonnes a year of organic solvents, almost
all of which end up in the atmosphere.
Two of the awards are for improving the environmental performance of cars -
the largest single source of air pollution in many countries. One is to
Johnson Matthey for autocatalysts. The other is to Ricardo Consulting
Engineers of Shoreham, West Sussex, for developing the practical application
of 'tumbling air motion' in mass-produced car engines.
The effect is to achieve more complete combustion than other systems,
leading to improved fuel economy (especially when starting from cold) and
reduced emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.
Edwards High Vacuum of Crawley, West Sussex, wins an award for its 'dry'
mechanical pumps which have no lubrication or sliding parts. They eliminate
at source the contaminated water or oil traditionally associated with vacuum
pumps in the chemical industry.
In contrast, solvents can easily be reclaimed from the vapours drawn off
from the new dry pumps.
Last year Edwards (part of the BOC group) won a Better Environment Award for
Industry from the Royal Society of Arts for the same products. The RSA
prizes were the direct inspiration for the new Queen's Award.
Since 1983 the RSA has operated three successive environmental awards
schemes, which illustrate the changing attitude toward industry's
environmental responsibilities over the last 10 years.
The pioneering Pollution Abatement Technology Awards concentrated on the
urgent need for end-of-pipe technology to clean up process industries. Then
came the more comprehensive Better Environment Awards for Industry.
That disappears this year, with the launch of the new Queen's Awards. In its
place the RSA has started Environmental Management Awards, 'to be given for
a significant initiative by British management in the pursuit of
sustainability which seeks to eliminate the negative impacts of business on
the environment while maintaining the long-term viability of the business.'
'We wanted to stay ahead of the game,' says Mike Harrison, who runs the
RSA's environmental awards, 'and we decided that the strategic thinking of
management at the board level was going to make the impact in future.' The
first RSA Environmental Management Awards will be announced in June.
The attitude of the environmental group Friends of the Earth to the new
Queen's Awards is summarised by Andrew Lees, campaigns director, as 'great,
but ..' He sums up his reservations: 'They don't go far enough, they are too
narrow in scope and they could be misleading.'
Mr Lees thinks the public could be misled - inadvertently or deliberately -
into thinking that the shiny Queen's Award emblem was an official
endorsement of a company's overall environmental achievement, based on an
audit of all its activities, whereas it is actually limited to one specific
product, technology or process. In fact, according to Mr Lees, some of this
year's winning companies leave a lot to be desired in their attitudes and
action on the environment.
On the whole, however, the extension of the Queen's Awards to the
environment will be welcomed as another symbol of the greening of the
government.
The organisers hope that they will be able to make more than 12 awards next
year, without compromising the strict standards that are essential for the
credibility of the Queen's Awards.
Privately, they were disappointed that only 5 per cent of this year's 240
applicants were judged to be worthy of an award.
The government will certainly want a better geographical distribution in
1994.
This year's list has a southern orientation with no winners at all in
north-east England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.
Nor are there any awards to environmentally important industries such as
bulk chemicals, oil and gas, paper and pulp, mining and quarrying, batteries
and energy storage, consumer goods and packaging.
