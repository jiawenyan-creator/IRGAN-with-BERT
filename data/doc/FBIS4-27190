  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Police Monday [30 May] 
arrested a member of a right-wing organization after he fired a 
gun shot at the ceiling of a hotel lobby in an abortive attempt 
to attack former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Hosokawa, who escaped unhurt, was on his way home from a 
party marking the establishment of the Tokyo chapter of the 
Japan New Party [JNP] which he heads, held at the Keio Plaza 
Hotel. 
  Police identified the suspect as Masakatsu Nozoe, 52. His 
shot missed the target as plainclothes men slapped the gunman on 
his hands holding a revolver aimed at Hosokawa, witnesses said. 
  But police later quoted Nozoe as saying he first aimed at 
Hosokawa but then fired at the ceiling. 
  The alleged assailant later told police that he had become 
upset with Hosokawa's apologies for Japan's wartime 
responsibilities and over his economic policies. 
  According to police, Nozoe approached the former prime 
minister in the third floor lobby of the hotel and fired the gun 
in the direction of Hosokawa. 
  Police officers immediately subdued the assailant, while 
plainclothes officers rushed the former premier out of the hotel 
and into a waiting car. 
  A shaken Hosokawa reportedly expressed concern for his wife 
as he was escorted out of the hotel, saying, "Kayoko is still 
here. Please (take care of her)." 
  Hosokawa, who has been burdened with questions surrounding 
his financial dealings, resigned last month as head of a fragile 
coalition government which replaced four decades of rule by the 
Liberal Democratic Party. 
  He has since maintained a low profile, reportedly staying at 
his Karuizawa retreat and at Tokyo hotels. 
  According to party sources, Hosokawa has been threatened by 
rightist organizations since assuming office last August over 
his apologies for Japanese atrocities during World War II. The 
JNP has reportedly taken precautions to protect Hosokawa since 
then.
