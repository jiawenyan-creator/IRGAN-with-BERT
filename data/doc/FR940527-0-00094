 

Item XXXV_Designation of Paying Office 


DFARS section 242.205(1) is revised to allow a department or agency payment office to serve as paying office for a contract
assigned to the Defense Contract Management Command if authorized by defense financial management regulations.
The revision also deletes the Air Force payment office for missile propellants as these contracts are now paid by Defense
Financial and Accounting Service (DFAS). 



Item XXXVI_Reports of Government Property 


DFARS section 245.50514 is revised to transfer requirements for contractor reporting on Government property
to a new clause at section 252.2457001, Reports of Government Property. In addition, the DD Form 1662, DoD Property
in the Custody of Contractors, has been revised to delete the certification requirement and to clarify reporting
instructions. 



Item XXXVII_Precious Metals 


DFARS section 245.6072(b) is revised to reflect the procedure initiated to streamline the process associated
with the recovery of precious metals. The Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service is prepositioning annual
disposition instructions for certain categories of precious metals with DoD contract administration offices.




Item XXXVIII_Notification of Proposed Program Termination or Reduction 



This interim rule replaces the interim rule which was issued as Departmental Letter 93007 on August 9, 1993.
It incorporates revisions necessitated by section 1372 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
1994 (Pub. L. 103160). 



Item XXXIX_Title to Contractor Acquired Property 


DFARS section 251.106(b) is deleted because the inconsistency in FAR, that section 251.106(b) was designed to correct,
has been remedied. FAR section 51.106(b) was amended by FAC 9016 to raise the threshold under which title to
contractor acquired property in contracts with educational institutions vests in the contractor. The $1,000 threshold
in FAR section 51.106(b) was increased to $5,000 to be consistent with the $5,000 threshold in Alternate II of the clause
at FAR section 52.2452 and Alternate I of the clause at FAR section 52.2455. 



Item XL_Carbonyl Iron Powders 


DFARS sections 225.7014 through 225.70143 and the clause at section 252.2257023 were removed by departmental
letter 94001, effective February 14, 1994, to delete the restriction on acquisition of carbonyl iron powders.
Language restricting acquisition to powders manufactured in the United States or Canada was in the FY 93 Defense Appropriations
Act but was not in the FY 94 Defense Appropriations Act. 



Item XLI_Coordinated Acquisition Assignments 



DFARS appendix B is amended to show that the Defense Logistics Agency has only a partial assignment for certain classes
of items within Federal Supply Group 36. 



Item XLII_Appendix G Update 


DFARS Appendix G is amended to update activity address codes. 



Item XLIII_Reflagging or Repair Work 


DFARS sections 247.571 and 247.573 were revised and section 252.2477025 was added as an interim rule by departmental
letter 94002, effective February 25, 1994, to implement section 315 of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Authorization
Act (Pub. L. 103160). Section 315 places restrictions on performance of reflagging or repair work on any vessel
used under a time charter contract. 



Item XLIV_Aircraft Fuel Cells 


DFARS sections 225.7021, 225.70211, 225.70212, 225.70213, and 252.2257038 were added
as an interim rule by departmental letter 94003, effective March 7, 1994, to implement section 8090 of the Fiscal
Year 1994 Defense Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 103139). Section 8090 prohibits using fiscal year 1994 appropriated
funds to procure aircraft fuel cells unless such cells are produced or manufactured in the United States by a domestic-operated
entity. The clause in section 252.2257038 is to be included in all solicitations and contracts involving fiscal
year 1994 funds, unless a waiver has been granted in accordance with section 225.7021.2.
