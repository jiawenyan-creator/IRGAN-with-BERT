FT  22 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Colombo braced for share fall
Colombo stockbrokers were braced today for a sharp fall in Sri Lankan shares
following last week's election victory by the opposition People's Alliance,
writes Stefan Wagstyl in Colombo.
Analysts said that shares, which have already fallen by over 25 per cent
from their peak early this year, could drop a further 10 per cent this week.
'I don't expect panic selling, but some investors will want to sell their
shares and few will want to buy: there will be a wait and see attitude',
says Mr Kishan Vairavanathan, an assistant general manager at CBC Crosby, a
joint venture between the Commercial Bank of Ceylon and Crosby Securities,
of Hong Kong.
Investors are concerned about the end of 17 years rule by the conservative
United National Party, which pursued pro-market economic policies. They are
worried that the People's Alliance, a centre-left coalition of nine parties,
will prove less accommodating towards business and finance.
While Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga, the new prime minister, has pledged to
continue with economic liberalisation, there are fears that she will be
under pressure from her left wing allies to intervene more in the economy.
She has also promised to increase welfare spending, which could lead to
higher taxes or bigger government borrowing. The budget deficit last year
was up from 7.3 per cent to a substantial 8.1 per cent of GDP.
However, her supporters point out that she has pledged to try to end the
civil war in the north, in which the Sri Lankan army is fighting Tamil Tiger
separatist guerillas. A negotiated settlement would lead to lower defence
spending and open opportunities for companies to rebuild the impoverished
north.
As measured by p/e ratios, Sri Lankan shares are cheap in comparison with
others in south Asia: large stocks trade on an average multiple of about 19
times earnings for 1993 and about 14 times expected earnings for 1994.
