FT  08 MAY 93 / How to Spend It: Light, airy and small
WHEN JEREMY Melvin, a working journalist and academic, bought a top-floor
flat in a standard end-of-terrace Victorian cottage near Waterloo, he was
faced with a familiar problem - how to conjure a light, airy environment out
of an intrinsically restricted space, how to find a working area for himself
and shelves for all his books.
He asked Allford Hall Monaghan Morris Architects to tackle the problem.
The flat was too small to lend itself to a major conversion. Melvin's main
brief to his architects was to rewire, clean up and redecorate, tidy the
kitchen and bathroom and create space for him to work and hold large
parties.
The solution to the study area was partly inspired by an Antonella painting
in the National Gallery (photographed here) and partly by Melvin's own
statement that the hall, between the living and bedrooms, he found was one
of the most congenial parts of the flat.
Using the headroom over the landing and space above the head of the
staircase, a study area was made. The whole structure - desk, platform and
toughened glass balustrade - is cantilevered off side walls by a steel
structure. The end result is light and airy. The desk, of aluminium
honeycomb sandwiched between two pieces of glass, reflects light and yet is
sturdy enough to support necessary equipment.
The wall in the hallway is now filled with books. To meet the brief for a
space large enough for a biggish party the doors into the living-room and
into the kitchen were widened so that the two spaces could be united.
The end result is simple and functional but with enough character to please
the eye and spirit as well. All this was done for Pounds 20,000.
