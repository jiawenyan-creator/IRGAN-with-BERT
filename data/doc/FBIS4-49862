Research Institute of the People's Bank of China: "Conditions 
and Policies for the Reform of Convertibility of the 
Renminbi"--edited by Zhan Xiaohong (6124 1420 3163)] 
  [Text] Convertibility of the renminbi is one of the 
overall goals of China's financial reform. In 1989 China set up 
on an experimental basis official foreign exchange swap markets; 
in July 1993 the central bank intervened for the first time in 
the transactions of foreign exchange swap markets to stabilize 
exchange rates. These were important reform measures moving 
toward convertibility, but to put into immediate effect complete 
convertibility of the renminbi, we cannot but seriously estimate 
the growth of foreign trade, the state's foreign exchange 
reserves, and the ability of the central bank to raise and 
supplement foreign exchange reserves in time by making use of 
the whole banking system and the financial market. As in all 
developing countries, there exists in China serious financial 
constraint, and a backward banking system and erroneous policies 
are leading to serious capital outflow, obstructing the 
modernization process of domestic banking business and the 
financial market, and weakening the ability of the central bank 
to allocate and collect foreign exchange funds. In view of 
this, in the reform of convertibility of the renminbi, efforts 
should be made to overcome financial constraint, correct 
erroneous policies, and promote in an overall manner the 
internationalization development of commercial banks and the 
building of an international financial center inside China. 
<H5>  I. The Causes and Necessary Conditions for Convertibility of </H5>
the Renminbi 
  The nature of the system of convertibility of the renminbi 
is 
that the foreign exchange needed for the import and capital 
export of ordinary residents can be bought from banks at the 
market price without restriction. There are two basic reasons 
for giving up traditional foreign exchange controls and 
replacing them with convertibility of the renminbi: 1) Foreign 
exchange controls must be based on foreign trade controls, which 
directly impedes the development of foreign trade; so, foreign 
exchange controls must be abolished; 2) after the reform of 
decontrolling foreign trade and further opening to the outside 
world, the cost to the government of exercising foreign exchange 
controls goes up, and as it is also subject to breeding 
corruption, it is better to abolish it. There are fundamental 
differences between convertibility and foreign exchange 
controls, in each case as a part of the currency system. 
Convertibility uses the state's foreign exchange reserves under 
the control of the central bank as a policy means, and regulates 
exchange rates by taking foreign currencies out of the market 
and putting them in, and then proceeds to regulate import and 
export trade; as for foreign exchange controls, it is for the 
government to control import and export trade by administrative 
means to stabilize exchange rates and seek the stability and 
growth of reserves. World history has proved that to maintain 
sustained economic growth, a country must be supported by 
continuous expansion of foreign trade. To speed up and maintain 
sustained high-speed growth, China must remove the constraints 
on foreign trade and foreign exchange controls over the growth 
of foreign trade, and must therefore carry out the reform of 
convertibility of the renminbi. 
  The economic feature of convertibility is to regulate import 
and export trade and the flow of international capital by 
fluctuations in exchange rates; conversely, trade changes for 
other reasons and large amounts of capital flow which affect the 
supply and demand on the foreign exchange market will also give 
rise to drastic fluctuations in exchange rates. Big 
fluctuations in exchange rates have an extremely unfavorable 
impact: 1) They create difficulties in the calculation of 
commodity prices, and impede the development of import and 
export trade; 2) they give rise to instability in the domestic 
money market, and increase difficulty in money policy; 3) they 
harm public confidence in the renminbi, and affect the political 
situation of stability and unity. To avoid unfavorable 
influences, the central bank, in order to carry out reform, must 
first have the ability to regulate market supply and demand and 
achieve stability of exchange rates. Therefore, the key to 
success in reform does not lie in whether or not exchange rates 
can spontaneously regulate import and export trade and the flow 
of international capital, but in whether or not the central bank 
has the ability to overcome big fluctuations in exchange rates. 
At present, it is especially necessary for the central bank to 
have the ability to offset the impact on the foreign exchange 
market caused by unfavorable export and large amounts of capital 
outflow, thus fundamentally replacing the restraint of existing 
foreign trade and foreign exchange controls on foreign exchange 
demand for import and for capital export. 
  To realize full regulation of foreign exchange supply and 
demand by the central bank, and achieve the goal of stabilizing 
exchange rates, it is necessary to have three conditions: 1) 
Ample foreign exchange reserves, including spot and short-term 
foreign exchange supply the central bank can control, and 
general drawing rights and special drawing rights with the IMF. 
2) Ample foreign exchange funds-merging channels; that is, the 
ability of the central bank to borrow in good time foreign 
exchange funds at low cost from financial organizations at home 
and abroad and from foreign governments. 3) A developed 
international financial center and foreign exchange market 
available inside China, capable of absorbing foreign exchange 
funds to stay in a centralized manner in large commercial banks 
in China through various highly efficient foreign exchange 
settlement businesses, spot and futures foreign exchange 
transactions, and various kinds of high added-value index-linked 
foreign exchange services. 
  Foreign exchange reserve assets are low-interest or 
interest-free foreign currency creditors' rights, with very 
little interest income and very high risk in exchange rates. If 
increases in reserves come from increases in debts, then there 
are also expenses for the cost of interest to keep the reserves. 
Therefore, it is not the case that the more foreign exchange 
reserves the better. Current experienced international practice 
is to measure it according to import volume, because settlement 
of payment for goods in most international trade uses 
three-month term bills. It is generally believed, therefore, 
that an appropriate level of foreign exchange reserves should be 
equal to three months of total import volume. For countries 
with a large export volume and a favorable balance of payments 
in constant items, total import volume can be appropriately 
reduced; conversely, for countries with a small export volume 
and an unfavorable balance of payments, total import volume can 
be appropriately increased. China belongs to the latter, and an 
appropriate level of reserves should be equal to four or five 
months of total import volume. 
  Limited foreign exchange reserves for import can only meet 
the needs of normal trade settlement, and can in no way offset 
the impact of foreign trade fluctuations and capital outflow on 
the foreign exchange market. China is a country exercising 
strict import control. Once restrictions are released, and 
imports increase by a big margin, capital outflow increases with 
export trade. It is inevitable that the subsequent unfavorable 
balance of payments will affect the market. Therefore, the 
central bank must have ample foreign exchange funds-merging 
channels, and when market exchange rates are high, raise foreign 
exchange, increase bear sales, and press down exchange rates in 
time; and when market exchange rates are low, buy foreign 
exchange in time, and use it for repayment of debts or deposit 
it in commercial banks for the purpose of stabilizing exchange 
rates. At present, the channels through which the central bank 
of China may merge foreign exchange funds in a timely way 
include: 1) Self-run foreign exchange funds of the Bank of 
China; 2) small amounts of foreign exchange deposits absorbed by 
the Bank of Industry and Commerce, the Bank of Construction, and 
the Bank of Communications; 3) loans from IMF special drawing 
rights; 4) loans from the central banks, governments, and 
commercial banks of foreign countries. Among the above 
channels, only banks in China may possibly lend foreign exchange 
funds unconditionally in time, but the amounts are extremely 
limited; there is no limit to the amounts from other channels, 
but procedures are complicated, the cost is great, and the 
restrictive terms are extremely harsh. Therefore, taken as a 
whole, relative to the requirements for stabilizing market 
fluctuations, the ability of China's central bank at present to 
transfer foreign exchange funds and its funds-merging channels 
are still extremely limited and utterly insufficient. 
  Full convertibility requires not only that the central bank 
has the ability to regulate and control, but also that there is 
a kind of market buffer ability capable of automatically 
offsetting the impact of drastic movements of international 
capital, and therefore it is required to have a developed 
foreign exchange market and numerous large transnational banks 
to build up an international financial center inside China. 
Take Shanghai and Shenzhen for example: As the securities 
markets there are fairly developed and standardized, funds in 
China automatically flow toward Shanghai and Shenzhen. For the 
same reason, if there is a developed international financial 
center, it can draw funds from at home and abroad on an 
extensive basis to stay in banks inside China to produce a solid 
cushioning effect in foreign exchange supply and demand, and the 
central bank can also make full use of foreign exchange funds of 
large commercial banks to stabilize the drastic fluctuations of 
exchange rates. 
<H5>  II. Financial Constraint Policy and Trends of Capital </H5>
Outflow 
  Financial constraint refers to the fact that due to 
restraint 
by factors of history and system, the development of China's 
banking business is in an extremely unfavorable situation in the 
face of international competition. It presses capital to flow 
out, and leads to loss of foreign exchange and stagnation in the 
development of China's banking business. Experiences of some 
developing countries show that if there exists serious financial 
constraint, if they rashly carry out monetary reform of real 
convertibility, they often aggravate capital outflow, affect the 
foreign exchange market, and the result is failure in the 
reform. As in almost all developing countries, there are also 
serious financial constraints in China, specifically expressed 
in the following aspects: 
  1. The backward banking system. There were not a few 
developments in China's banking business in more than 10 years 
of reform. The central bank was organized, and many commercial 
banks were newly set up. However, the central bank did not 
fully control the means of financial management that fit the 
requirements of a market economy, but stuck to the restraint of 
the traditional planned credit system, limiting the number of 
newly established banks, limiting new businesses developed by 
banks, and restricting banks' free choice in the methods of 
credit and property mix to supplement capital by making use of 
the market. Under these restrictions, the financial management 
which took a leading position in commercial bank operations lost 
its significance, and therefore it was difficult to fully raise 
the level of operation and management and vocational skill, 
which finally impeded the growth of large international 
commercial banks and the birth of an international financial 
center, and also impeded the development of funds-merging 
channels overseas and the extensive absorption of foreign 
exchange funds. 
  2. The money market settlement system is extremely 
backward. A strictly standardized and highly efficient 
settlement system is the basis of the credit system of modern 
banks, and on that basis various kinds of high-tech financial 
innovation business can be done successfully, such as foreign 
exchange futures, futures rights, monetary funds, and money 
exchange to provide necessary services of money value-keeping 
and increment for foreign trade enterprises and investors. 
However, there is not yet a written law on negotiable 
instruments in China to serve as the basis of a monetary 
settlement system, and the rights and duties of creditors and 
debtors lack ample legal guarantees, which restricts the 
settlement technique in developing in the direction of safety 
and high efficiency. Backward settlement instruments plus 
low-service efficiency compel enterprises and investors to 
choose banks outside China to keep their foreign exchange 
position, or let enterprises outside China gratuitously occupy 
the short-term use of foreign exchange settlement funds, which 
delays foreign exchange earnings for export, and impedes the 
development and growth of a foreign exchange market inside China. 
  3. Strict foreign exchange controls increase the cost of 
foreign exchange. The reform of keeping part of foreign 
exchange earnings increases the power of foreign trade 
enterprises in using foreign exchange, but the existing planned 
distribution of foreign exchange quotas still strictly restricts 
the use of foreign exchange by various kinds of enterprises and 
ordinary residents, which increases the noncurrency cost of 
enterprises and residents in obtaining foreign exchange. It 
makes them feel that it is more convenient to keep foreign 
exchange themselves. Therefore, stimulation of foreign exchange 
demand is reflected in the market as exchange rates on the black 
market being artificially pushed up. In addition, the fixed 
exchange rates system and quota distribution make the whole 
foreign exchange settlement system become further extremely 
complicated, and compel foreign trade enterprises to choose 
constantly keeping large amounts of foreign exchange to provide 
against any contingency. Therefore, the demand for foreign 
exchange is artificially increased. 
  4. The capital market is small and backward, and investors 
look to overseas markets. At present, some enterprise 
corporations which have high management level and abundant funds 
still find it difficult to invest and develop through the 
capital market. They turn to look for overseas investments and 
capital export. 
  5. Erroneous money policies and revenue policies. Misled by 
theory, China practices a 100 percent reserve fund ratio 
requirement for financial deposits in commercial banks, and a 13 
percent reserve fund ratio for ordinary deposits. These two 
regulations cause the operational funds of commercial banks in 
China to be reduced by over 10 percent compared with banks 
outside China, virtually increasing the cost of funds. At the 
end of 1992, the People's Bank announced that the renminbi could 
be taken out of China, and foreign banks outside China started 
competing for renminbi settlement business, creating a powerful 
competitive momentum for banks inside China, and weakening the 
sources of foreign exchange funds from inside China. In 1993, 
the central bank, by administrative means, imposed on financial 
centers in coastal areas the purchase of funds-merging coupons, 
which further weakened the funds operation capacity of 
commercial banks, and stimulated banks in these areas to 
exchange funds for foreign exchange and transfer it outside 
China for operations, thus turning it into an outflow of 
financial capital. Moreover, a high tax rate policy for banks 
and low-wage policy for bank staff also at present make banks in 
China face the perplexity of backward technological equipment 
and loss of professional managerial staff. 
  The direct consequence of financial constraint is capital 
outflow, and the following statistical analysis shows China's 
present scale of capital outflow. 
  1. Foreign trade settlement funds have flowed out of China 
for a long time, estimated at $16.97 billion in 1992. Due to 
backwardness in the foreign exchange settlement system and the 
lack of necessary foreign exchange value-keeping services, 
China's foreign exchange receipts for export are generally 
delayed, and payment for import is basically made by spot 
exchange (payment upon delivery), and foreign exchange receipts 
for export are delayed for three months on average. For 
example, in 1992 imports amounted to $64.385 billion, and 
exports amounted to $69.567 billion. Supposing payment for 
imports was delayed for one month on average, and foreign 
exchange for exports was received two months ahead of schedule 
on average (53.65 = 643.85/12; 115.94 = 695.67/6; 169.6 = 53.65 
+ 115.94), with the two added together, China would have $16.96 
billion of settlement funds available for use, but due to the 
backwardness of the settlement system, it is now used by foreign 
businessmen, which is tantamount to capital outflow. 
  2. Short-term capital outflow is on average larger than 
capital inflow. According to international payment statistics, 
the net amounts of inflow and outflow of China's short-term 
assets items have been as shown in Table 1. Negative values in 
the Table are unfavorable short-term capital balances 
(outflow&gt; inflow), the largest being 31.98 (1990), the smallest 
9.06 (1992), while the largest favorable balance is only 3.62 
(1991). The sum total of favorable balances of various years 
added together is still lower than the smallest unfavorable 
balance. Therefore, the basic trend of short-term capital items 
is an unfavorable balance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  3. There is a trend of a progressive decrease in the 
favorable balance of long-term capital. It can be seen from 
Table 2 that the favorable balance of capital items increased 
year by year during the 1986-1988 period, and in 1989 started 
decreasing year by year, and an unfavorable balance appeared for 
the first time in 1992. It proves that China's capital outflow 
was expanding and the use of foreign capital was decreasing. 
Mid-term capital items reached a peak of $8.238 billion in 
1986, and subsequently presented a trend of fluctuation and 
decline. There was a slight upturn in 1988 and 1990, and it 
decreased drastically in 1991. This trend was basically 
identical with China's reform of the decontrolling of foreign 
trade, and with changes in enterprises setting up overseas 
organizations since 1990.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  4. Trade items changed from sustained unfavorable balance to 
sustained favorable balance. This change was identical with the 
trend of a progressive decrease in favorable balance in capital 
items. It showed that a part of exports was changed into 
overseas investments without foreign exchange income. Comparing 
the growth rate of imports with that of exports, imports were 
mainly constrained by planned quotas, artificial factors led to 
fluctuations in growth rate, and there was no inevitable 
connection with the trend of changes in trade items. Therefore, 
the trend of trade items was mainly determined by sustained 
export growth. From 1985 to 1992, there was a total export 
growth of 177 percent, and import growth of 68 percent. The 
difference between the two was the decrease in the use of 
foreign capital and the loss of foreign exchange funds.

  5. The escaping of foreign exchange funds. Table 4 includes 
items of errors and omissions in the balance of international 
payments, which shows the defects of the statistical system and 
the escaping of foreign exchange funds. If these were only 
statistical defects, the errors and omissions in various years 
should tend toward stability; if statistics were improved, the 
margin of fluctuations should be even smaller, and tend to be 
identical with the changes in trade items. However, the 
numerical values listed in the table are obviously to the 
contrary, which proves that there was escape of foreign exchange 
funds. Drastic fluctuations started in 1989, showing that the 
escape became serious, especially when it reached $8.419 
billion, amounting to 12.1 percent (84.19/695.67) of export 
volume. Supposing that errors and omissions caused by 
statistical defects amounted to an annual average 3 percent of 
exports, then the escape of capital in 1992 reached $6 billion 
(84.19 x (12.1 percent - 3 percent)/12.1). Added to the outflow 
of settlement funds, the total is $23 billion, exceeding 30 
percent of total export volume. According to international 
experience in the development of market economy, developed 
countries require the use of capital export as a means to open 
up, expand, and occupy overseas markets, and developing 
countries must also make use of this means in the face of fierce 
competition in overseas markets. According to the experience of 
the "four Asian dragons," with their high-speed economic 
development, there are three stages of change in capital items 
in international payments: In the early stage of economic 
development, there is a sustained favorable balance 
(import&gt; export) in capital items; when they get close to the 
take-off stage, both favorable and unfavorable balances of 
capital items will frequently appear alternately; when they 
reach the take-off stage and become an affluent society, there 
will appear a constant unfavorable balance in capital items. 
China is a developing country, and is extremely short of 
capital. It cannot but cause people anxiety that capital export 
should quicken in the early stage of economic development. 
Financial constraint leads to too early capital outflow, and if 
we do not speed up financial reform, try to remove financial 
constraint, and carry out the reform of convertibility of the 
renminbi, it will possibly lead to more serious capital outflow, 
and harm the development of China's financial market, the 
prosperity of the banking business, and sustained economic 
growth. A large amount of capital outflow affects the foreign 
exchange market, and the instability it causes may possibly 
finally lead to failure in convertibility.

  III. Proposals for Reform Measures 
  Once we make clear the relations of capital export to 
economic growth and financial constraint, in the face of 
inadequate foreign exchange reserves and capital outflow, our 
measures should emphatically be concerned with removing 
financial constraint and carrying out a step-by-step limited 
regulation of the renminbi exchange rate, so as to achieve 
success in the reform of convertibility of the renminbi. 
Specific proposals for measures to be taken include the 
following aspects: 
  1. Carry out all-round and in-depth financial reform, and 
overcome the restraint of the traditional planned system of 
centralized credit. In this respect, it requires replacing the 
current planned distribution of centralized credit with control 
of the quantity of money and overall financial supervision and 
management by the central bank, supervising and controlling 
banks' credit creation by the proportion of banks assets, and 
guiding and ensuring improvement in the overall quality of 
financial organizations by high-standard and scientific market 
admittance conditions, thus fundamentally overcoming the 
malpractices of the current system in one-sidedly emphasizing 
quantitative restrictions, making light of quality control, and 
using a single policy to deal with all kinds of problems; and 
quickening the healthy development of the financial business. 
  2. Promote the building of financial centers in an overall 
manner, and vigorously widen the financing channels at home and 
abroad. It is necessary to speed up the reform of specialized 
banks, urge them to face the market, and actively raise the 
management level; it is necessary to develop and organize many 
large transnational commercial banks, and encourage them to 
engage in foreign exchange settlement business and various kinds 
of foreign exchange value-keeping business of high added value, 
so as to speed up the expansion, escalation, and renovation of 
the foreign exchange market; it is necessary to speed up working 
out the law on negotiable instruments of an international 
standard, set up a specialized inter-bank clearing bank, and 
promote the progress of settlement technology and the healthy 
development of the money market; it is necessary to choose a 
large city which is an economic center with conditions to serve 
as an experiment in building an international financial center, 
absorb international short-term funds for long-term deposits, 
and develop in an overall manner financing channels at home and 
abroad for Chinese banks. 
  3. Improve policy operation, and heighten fully the 
competitive position of China's banking business. To improve 
policy operation at present, we must abolish the irrational 
regulation which requires a 100 percent reserve fund for 
financial deposits and, referring to international practice, we 
should reduce the legal reserve fund ratio to below 5 percent, 
and reduce banks' income tax rate to below 20 percent, so that 
the cost of funds of Chinese banks will be reduced and come 
close to the general international level; [Footnote 1: The 
results of practice prove that the regulation on reserve funds 
for financial deposits is not conducive to the control of money 
quantity. That banks by every possible means change general 
deposits into financial deposits leads to the distortion of bank 
behavior and a lack of fidelity in statistics, disadvantageous 
to macroeconomic regulation and control. Such a policy is 
brought about purely by misleading theory, and must therefore be 
abolished. The reserve fund ratio of general deposits is 3 
percent in the United States, and 0.5 percent in the United 
Kingdom, and in recent years many Asian countries have also 
greatly reduced the reserve fund ratio. As for banks' income 
tax rate, for Swiss banks it is below 10 percent, and it is 
about 5 percent in Hong Kong.] we must fully decontrol the 
stipulation of wages for bank staff, and allow banks to increase 
by a big margin the wages of their technological grade staff, so 
as to promote the training and reduce the loss of senior 
managerial staff; it is necessary to improve the issue of 
funds-merging coupons, replace fixed-interest-rate purchase 
imposed administratively with the principle of voluntary 
purchase, set up securities buy-back arrangements, and reduce 
restrictions on banks' use of funds; it is necessary to 
standardize and develop the inter-bank market, and strengthen 
the central bank's regulation of interest rates and funds of the 
inter-bank market; it is necessary to allow commercial banks to 
choose methods of fund-raising according to the principles of 
minimum cost, timely sources, and longest duration, and to 
choose the methods of loans and property mix according to the 
principle of maximum profit, minimum risk, and full mobility, 
and abolish the present various irrational restrictions on 
banks' methods of fund-raising, methods of lending, and property 
mix to enable them to truly become commercial banks. 
  4. Speed up the building of the capital market, improve its 
organizational structure, reduce its transaction costs and 
information costs, and quicken the development of the securities 
business, so as to promote the process of enterprise reform. It 
is necessary to allow banks to make use of the capital market to 
cast off the historical burden of idle loans by securitization 
and capitalization of debts, speed up reform, and become large 
modern commercial banks. It is necessary to widen the capacity 
and range of the capital market, create channels for taking in 
and putting out huge amounts of funds for the development of 
large, newly emerging enterprises and the building of the 
state's key projects, encourage active absorption in multiple 
forms of capital at home and overseas, and reduce as far as 
possible early loss of home capital. 
  5. Practice limited regulation of exchange rates in steps, 
and have a gradual transition to convertibility of the renminbi. 
Based on the progress of financial reform and the extent of 
gradual widening of market funds-merging channels, the reform of 
convertibility of the renminbi should be promoted beginning now 
in three steps. The first step: Implement limited regulation 
according to existing amounts of foreign exchange reserves, and 
with the average exchange rates of the previous three years as 
the central target, allow 20 percent market exchange rate 
fluctuations, carry out regulation when this range is exceeded, 
and retain some foreign exchange controls. The second step: 
Make full use of the strength of foreign exchange funds of 
commercial banks in China, and borrow funds from international 
financial organizations for exchange rate regulation. Keep the 
exchange rate fluctuations within the range of 5 percent above 
or below the central rate, and carry out a small degree of 
crawling devaluation of the renminbi against major international 
currencies. Gradually remove planned quota distribution of 
foreign exchange, and stop the issue of new foreign exchange 
coupons. The third step: Under the circumstances that banking 
reform is basically in position and that the international 
financial center inside China is built on a preliminary basis, 
carry out reforms toward a unified market, full regulation, and 
maintenance of a stable exchange rate. By a unified market is 
meant unifying and merging into one the current official parity 
foreign exchange market, the foreign exchange quota swap market, 
and the free transaction market among the people, unifying 
standards, and realizing a unitary market in which the renminbi 
is fully convertible. Through exchange rate regulation, it is 
necessary to keep the fluctuations within the range of 2.5 
percent above or below the central rate, coordinate with 
domestic economic policies, carry out unlimited buying and 
selling, and achieve basic stability of exchange rates. Based 
on China's present level of foreign exchange reserves and market 
funds-merging conditions, we can only carry out the first-step 
reform of limited regulation in one or two years, but we must 
speed up financial reform, actively create conditions for a 
higher goal, and finally realize full convertibility of the 
renminbi.
