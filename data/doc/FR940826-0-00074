Abuses.

 As stated above, we intend by these attribution rules to ensure that bidders and recipients of these licenses are 

bona fide

 in their eligibility, and we intend to conduct random audits both before the auctions and during the 10-year initial
license period to ensure that our rules are complied with in letter and spirit. If we find that large firms or individuals
exceeding our personal net worth caps are able to assume control of licensees that have received small business provisions
or otherwise circumvent our rules, we will not hesitate to force divestiture of such improper interests or, in appropriate
cases, issue forfeitures or revoke licenses. In this regard, we reiterate that it is our intent, and the intent of Congress,
that women, minorities and small businesses be given an opportunity to participate in narrowband PCS services, not
merely as fronts for other entities, but as active entrepreneurs.
57. In addition, in view of our new small business definition and the associated maximum investor limits, we are modifying
our unjust enrichment rules to prevent any post-auction circumvention of our financial threshold, and to ensure
that the ultimate licensees are 

bona fide

 designated entities. Accordingly, firms that received installment payments based on their small business status
will be subject to repayment if, for example, another entity subsequently purchases an ``attributable'' interest
or becomes a member of the control group and, as a result, the gross revenues of the firm would exceed the $40 million
gross revenues cap, or the personal net worth of an individual investor exceeds the $40 million personal net worth
threshold.


B. Bidding Credits in Regional Narrowband Auctions


58. In the 

Third Report and Order

 we established bidding credits of 25 percent for women- and minority-owned businesses on two of the six regional narrowband
licenses.
<FOOTCITE>93</FOOTCITE>
 In order to increase the opportunities for women and minorities to participate in the provision of narrowband service,
we have decided to increase the bidding credit on the same two licenses for women- and minority-owned businesses in
the upcoming regional narrowband auction from 25 percent to 40 percent. Our experience with the nationwide narrowband
PCS auctions, where very high license values coupled with only a 25 percent bidding credit may have contributed to
the failure of women- and minority-owned businesses to win licenses, suggests that a credit of this magnitude may
be necessary to overcome the disadvantages of these groups in bidding for licenses representing large populations
and large geographic areas.
<FOOTCITE>94</FOOTCITE>
 In an 

ex parte

 filing, Essence Television Productions, Inc. one of the initial participants in the nationwide narrowband PCS auction,
argues that designated entities should receive bidding credits of up to 40 percent when competing in auctions against
non-designated entities.
<FOOTCITE>95</FOOTCITE>
 The increased bidding credit combined with installment payments for firms that meet our revised small business definition
should enable minority- and women-owned businesses to attract the capital necessary to compete. In addition, we
seek comment on whether additional measures such as an entrepreneur's block should be employed in future auctions
(see 

infra.

).

C. Rural Telephone Companies


59. In this docket, we established general rules and identified several measures, including installment payments,
spectrum set-asides, bidding credits and tax certificates, that we would choose among in establishing rules for
auctionable spectrum-based services, on a service-specific basis. In adopting service-specific rules, we have
carefully selected provisions to meet the particular needs of each designated entity group, so as to ``ensure,''
pursuant to the statute, that each group has the opportunity to participate in providing spectrum-based services.
60. As we indicated above, it is occasionally necessary to do more to ensure that businesses owned by members of minority
groups and women have a meaningful opportunity to participate in provision of personal communications services
than is necessary to ensure that other designated entity groups have similar opportunities.
<FOOTCITE>96</FOOTCITE>
 The major problem facing minorities and women who seek to offer PCS is lack of access to capital.
<FOOTCITE>97</FOOTCITE>
 Small businesses also encounter serious funding problems.
<FOOTCITE>98</FOOTCITE>
 In contrast, rural telephone companies that are not small businesses (and are not owned by minorities or women) do
not face the same difficulties in obtaining capital. Accordingly, we do not believe that any additional provisions
for rural telephone companies are necessary or appropriate in the context of narrowband PCS. Moreover, as we stated
in the 

Second Report and Order,

 limiting installment payments to smaller businesses, including those owned by minorities and women, best comports
with the intent of Congress by avoiding auction procedures that tend to favor incumbents with established revenue
streams over new companies and entrepreneurs.
<FOOTCITE>99</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, rural telephone companies that are not eligible as small businesses will not receive installment payment
assistance.
