SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 30118(a) (formerly section 152(a) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966,
as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1412(a)), NHTSA has made an initial decision that certain child safety seats manufactured by
Fisher-Price, Inc., do not comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213,
Child Restraint Systems, 49 CFR 571.213. Compliance tests performed for NHTSA indicate that the shoulder belt webbing
on Fisher-Price Models AO9191, DO9191, 9103, 9149, 9173, 9179, and 9180 seats manufactured between 1988 and September
16, 1993 do not meet the flammability requirements of FMVSS No. 213 and therefore would not provide adequate protection
to children in the event of a fire in a vehicle in which they are installed.




Pursuant to 49 CFR 554.10, a public meeting will be held at 10 a.m., on Monday, October 21, 1994 in Room 9230, Department
of Transportation Building, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC, at which time the manufacturer and all other
interested persons will be afforded an opportunity to present data, views, and arguments on the issue of whether the
child safety seats covered by this initial decision comply with FMVSS No. 213.

In September 1993, Fisher-Price filed a petition seeking an exemption from the recall requirements of the statute
on the basis that any noncompliance with the flammability requirements of FMVSS No. 213 was inconsequential as it
relates to motor vehicle safety (58 FR 59511). After NHTSA denied the petition (59 FR 23253), Fisher-Price appealed
(59 FR 30957). In conjunction with its appeal, Fisher-Price requested the agency to convene a public meeting on the
inconsequentiality issue, which was scheduled for August 17, 1994 (59 FR 39015).

Pursuant to the agency's regulations governing inconsequentiality petitions, 49 CFR 556.4(a), such petitions
may only be filed after a determination that a noncompliance exists. Until recently, NHTSA had believed that Fisher-Price
had made such a determination in September 1993, prior to filing its inconsequentiality petition. However, on August
10, 1994, Fisher-Price informed the agency that it was taking the position that it had never formally determined that
a noncompliance existed. NHTSA therefore canceled the public meeting and terminated the inconsequentiality proceeding
(59 FR 42326). The documents reflecting the agency's consideration of that petition may be found in NHTSA Docket No.
9379.

Under the circumstances, NHTSA has resumed its noncompliance investigation and, as described above, has made an
initial decision that these Fisher-Price car seats do not comply with FMVSS No. 213. Pursuant to 49 CFR 556.4(a), Fisher-Price
could at this time renew its petition for an inconsequentiality determination. However, by letter dated August 25,
1994, counsel for Fisher-Price advised NHTSA that the company did not plan to file such a petition, even if the agency
should finally decide that a noncompliance exists.

Interested persons are invited to participate in this proceeding through written an/or oral presentations. Persons
wishing to make oral presentations are requested to notify Ms. Elaine Beale, Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance,
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Room 6111, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590, (202)
3662832, before the close of business on October 18, 1994. Written comments must be submitted to the same address
and received not later than the beginning of the meeting on October 21, 1994.

All materials related to the issues addressed by this notice are available for public inspection during working hours
(9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.) in NHTSA's Technical Reference Library, Room 5108, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590.
