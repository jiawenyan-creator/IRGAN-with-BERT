Tired of TQM (Total Quality Management), and bored with BPR (Business
Process Re-engineering)? Why not join the JTL club? It's becoming
increasingly fashionable in the UK steel industry and is related to the JIT
(just-in-time) delivery cult.
According to Metal Bulletin, membership is restricted to steel users who
tend to wait until they are already running out of material before they
order more. The result is that it arrives 'just too late'.
