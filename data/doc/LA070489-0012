UCLA REPORT ON POVERTY 
Congratulations UCLA and The Times for making the public aware ("Poverty Gap 
Growing in L.A., Report Finds," Part I, June 20, "The Poor Get Poorer," 
editorial, June 21) of what local teachers, police, social and health 
professionals already know. Yes, the poor are getting poorer. There's trouble 
in River City. 
Undoubtedly, Prof. Paul Ong is sincere in saying "It's very difficult for 
people on the Westside like myself to understand that this is going on." 
However, it is naive not to realize that a large percentage of the more 
affluent are aware but avoid, ignore or deny the plight of the working poor, 
except when crime enters the picture. 
The statement that "less than 5% of the city's middle-class and well-to-do 
families pay more than half of their income for rent" seems to be the only 
mention of the middle class. Herein lies another tale. 
Whereas, in the past, the bulk of Los Angeles landlords were middle-income 
folks who tended their property and made a profit through reasonable rents, 
this is not so today. Now it is almost impossible for the middle class to 
purchase rental property. High prices and conglomerates that buy and tear down 
apartments to build condos and office buildings discourage small ownership. 
Yes, the affluent do have a stake in the problems of the poor, but let's not 
forget the man in the middle. He, she or we are becoming extinct. Too bad, 
because some of our values will be sorely missed.
