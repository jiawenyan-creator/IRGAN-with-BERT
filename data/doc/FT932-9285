FT  14 MAY 93 / Letter: Flawed procurement policy a threat to UK
shipbuilding
Sir, Jonathan Aitken, the defence procurement minister, argues that the
award of the contract for a helicopter carrier to VSEL rather than Swan
Hunter was made on 'our normal technical and value-for-money criteria' ('200
jobs threatened at Swan Hunter', May 12). Further analysis suggests that
competition was far from fair. It also indicates that divorcing defence
procurement decisions from broader industrial policy considerations is
likely to be disastrous.
VSEL has, since the early 1970s, held a monopoly of nuclear submarine
construction. It seems obvious that the company might use its monopoly
profits, especially those obtained with the huge Trident contract, to buy
back into the surface warship market. By contrast, Swan Hunter has had to
compete for all its recent naval orders. Moreover, the dearth of such orders
directly resulting from the excessive concentration on Trident must have
undermined its ability to offer competitive prices.
The result of the competitive process will be an extension of VSEL's nuclear
monopoly to large surface warships. The government should recognise that its
current procurement policies are flawed and are leading to a loss of
valuable capacity and skills which could be employed outside the defence
market.
Most experts believe that the world merchant shipbuilding market will expand
substantially from the mid-1990s. Swan Hunter should at the very least be
given the same level of government support, at present denied, as the
handful of remaining UK merchant shipbuilders already receive in order to
compete in the world market. This policy and more determined support for
other diversification measures and a more honest appraisal of so-called
value for money defence policies might go some way both to preserving some
competition and some capacity in UK shipbuilding.
