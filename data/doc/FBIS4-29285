  [Text] Malaysia Airlines [MAS] has entered into a 
tripartite alliance with Malaysian Helicopter Services and World 
Airways Incorporated to expand its fast-growing international 
cargo services business. Several agreements signed today 
between the parties would enable MAS to purchase cargo (?safes) 
and expand its business in the main markets of Europe, the 
United States, and the high-growth Asia-Pacific region beginning 
the 19th of this month. 
  MAS deputy managing director for marketing, Baharuddin 
Nordin, said the carrier would be able to tap the intra-European 
freight market centering around Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Zurich, 
Paris, and Brussels. It will also provide a direct link between 
Penang and Los Angeles and cater for electronic exports which 
are ballooning. This is evident by the 33 billion ringgit 
[Malaysian currency] in Malaysia's exports of the products in 
the January-September 1993 period. 
  Meanwhile, Malaysia Airlines success in organizing annual 
haj 
pilgrimages to Mecca for thousands of Muslims has caught the eye 
of World Airways Incorporated. The Washington-based airline is 
now keen to organize pilgrimages for the growing Muslim 
population in America and China. World Airways executive vice 
president Encik [Mr.] Ahmad K. Khatib said in Kuala Lumpur that 
Malaysia had done exceptionally well in this area and the airway 
wants to emulate it, for it is not easy to organize flights for 
thousands of pilgrims. He said this to newsmen after a 
tripartite signing agreement beetween MAS, Malaysian Helicopter 
Services [MHS] and World Airways which will enable MAS to expand 
its international cargo business. MHS has a 24.9 percent stake 
in World Airways. 
  MHS executive director Wan Malik Ibrahim said World Airways 
could utilize the linkages Malaysia has developed with China to 
tap into the country's Muslim population which is said to be 
larger than the Muslim population in Malaysia.
