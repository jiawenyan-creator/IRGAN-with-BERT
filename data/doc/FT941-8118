FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney banks receive audit
report
The committee representing the creditor banks of Euro Disney, the stricken
leisure group, yesterday received a long-awaited audit of the company's
financial situation from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy group.
The report, which clears the way for detailed negotiations between the
banks, Euro Disney and Walt Disney, includes an assessment of the commercial
strategy being pursued by the group.
According to one source, however, the report did not advocate significant
changes to Euro Disney's strategy, drawn up last year, and which includes
greater emphasis on cost controls, increased variation in pricing to smooth
seasonal variations and measures to encourage short-stay visits.
Negotiations are expected to start later this week or next. Walt Disney,
which holds 49 per cent of Euro Disney's equity, has set March 31 for the
conclusion of negotiations. After then, it warned, it would no longer
provide financial support.
The negotiations will focus on how restructuring is to be shared. According
to the report, Euro Disney requires a capital injection of up to FFr13bn
(Dollars 2.17bn) to reduce its FFr20.3bn debts.
Walt Disney is pressing the banks to reduce Euro Disney's debts through the
combination of a rights issue and a debt for equity swap. But Euro Disney's
60 banks want concessions from the US parent company.
