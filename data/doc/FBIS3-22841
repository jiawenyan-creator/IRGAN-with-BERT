  [Text] China has been closely analyzing North Korea's 
nuclear technology level during the past year since the North 
Korean nuclear issue became an international issue. It was 
learned that China ultimately concluded that North Korea had not 
yet reached the level of developing nuclear warheads. 
  A high-ranking diplomatic source in Beijing said: "After a 
long investigation into various aspects of the North Korean 
nuclear issue, China judges that North Korea's current nuclear 
technology is only at the level of reprocessing plutonium and 
that it has yet to reach the level of nuclear enrichment." 
  According to this source, China views that North Korea's 
economy limits nuclear development.
