FT  02 APR 94 / International Company News: Saint Louis slips
Groupe Saint Louis, the French industrial group with interests in sugar and
paper, saw net profits slip to FFr717m last year, from FFr774m in 1992,
writes John Ridding.
The company showed that the relative stability of its results demonstrated
its resilience in the face of a deterioration in the European economy last
year and the effects of strong price competition.
