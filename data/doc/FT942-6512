FT  30 MAY 94 / Observer: Ms Liberty gets a rival
China is on a bit of a roll at the moment. Last week the US abandoned
attempts to link China's trade status with human rights. Now Shanghai wants
to erect a bigger and better version of New York's Statue of Liberty.
It is only five years since some of China's 'huddled masses yearning to
breathe free' were massacred at Tiananmen Square, so it seems a bit rich to
erect a monument celebrating liberty.
However Shanghai, which has soaring ambitions as a financial and trade hub,
wants to mark the turn of the century with an eye-catching sculpture.
Whether it will be on Chongming Island at the mouth of Yangtze, or Wusongkou
island, hasn't been fixed yet.
What's not in dispute is that it will be 118m tall, compared with Miss
Liberty who is 92m tall if she stands on her pedestal.
