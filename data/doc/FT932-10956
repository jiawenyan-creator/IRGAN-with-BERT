FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Royal Bank advances 91% to Pounds 92m
despite bad debt provisions
A RETURN to profit in its core branch banking business and trebled profits
in its Direct Line telephone insurance operation helped Royal Bank of
Scotland raise interim pre-tax profits by 91 per cent, from Pounds 48m to
Pounds 91.6m.
The bank, which increased loans to customers in the six months to March 31
helped by a Pounds 650m rise in personal mortgages, said it was confident
that full-year provisions for bad and doubtful debts would be below last
year.
Lord Younger, chairman, said he was confident of further progress in the
second half, helped by renewed economic growth.
'The upturn in performance at the full year is not only being sustained, but
is gathering momentum,' he said.
Although profit before provisions rose 32 per cent to Pounds 285m (Pounds
216m), the rise at the pre-tax level was contained by bad debt provisions.
These stood at Pounds 183m (Pounds 163m), but were substantially lower than
the figure of Pounds 238m for last year's second half.
These latest accounts were prepared under the FRS 3 accounting standard, and
the comparatives have been restated accordingly.
The interim dividend is been raised to 3p (2.8p) on earnings per share of 5p
(2.9p).
The core ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets rose to 7 per cent
(6.6 per cent) after the bank retained Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 1m).
Branch banking returned to profit with Pounds 6m (Pounds 8.4m profit), after
a poor second half pushed it into a Pounds 16.1m loss in 1991-92. The
Columbus restructuring project was estimated to have raised profits by
Pounds 5m.
The corporate and institutional banking division raised profits by 39 per
cent to Pounds 57.1m. 'Very considerable progress' had been made in selling
treasury and capital markets services to existing corporate customers.
Citizens Financial Group, the US retail banking subsidiary which is to boost
its assets by nearly 50 per cent by acquiring Boston Five Bancorp, lifted
profits by Pounds 12m to Pounds 20.9m.
Mr George Mathewson, chief executive, said Royal Bank had been approached by
a large US bank which hoped to link with its Ibos service offering
cross-border banking services to companies in Britain, Spain, Portugal and
France.
The proposed disposal of 90.1 per cent of Charterhouse, Royal Bank's
merchant bank, is expected to lead to a book loss of Pounds 35m. The net
reduction to reserves will be Pounds 12m, after writing back Pounds 23m of
goodwill on disposal.
Net interest income rose to Pounds 421m (Pounds 384m) as the spread between
the interest earned on assets and paid on liabilities rose to 2.2 percentage
points (1.9 percentage points) and interest bearing assets rose 12 per cent.
Other operating income rose to Pounds 313m (Pounds 240m) and now constitutes
42 per cent of total income (38 per cent). Expenses rose by 10 per cent, but
the cost to income ratio fell to 61.4 per cent (65.6 per cent).
The shares closed unchanged at 267p.
