FT  05 JAN 94 / Arts: Today's Television
The second of BBC2's programmes this week featuring new dance works, Dance
For The Camera, is a salute to the Wild West: wide open spaces, saloon doors
and plenty of leaping about. The choreography is by Yolande Snaith, music by
Graeme Miller, and Ross MacGibbon directs. The ballet is performed by Dance
Quorum (8.15).
The central character in ITV's new six-part police drama, 99-1, is described
hopefully as 'a cross between Callan, Man In A Suitcase and The Fugitive'.
This semi-bent copper is played by Leslie Grantham and we are told that the
police think he is corrupt while the crooks think he is still a copper. Who
knows, perhaps there really is still mileage in the grittily realistic crime
series (9.00).
Somebody somewhere has declared 1994 'The Year Of The Family' so BBC1 is
mounting a 90-minute programme called The Family Show. It's one of those
studio-based talk-ins which usually have too many 'experts' and too many
pre-recorded inserts, but we shall see (9.30).
