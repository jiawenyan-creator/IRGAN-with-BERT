FT  17 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Christies
There are two explanations for the admission by Christies International that
its reduced dividend will form the basis for future payments. Either it is
bravely doing what many other companies should do and admitting to long
delays before profits recover. Or it simply cannot disguise the dire state
of the art business.
There is not much chance of a rescue from Japan, whose once lavish spenders
have now turned sellers. With the shares on an exorbitant forward multiple
of around 35, the market will probably extract a price for candour, whatever
its motivation.
