  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura will probably remain in the cabinet after a 
reshuffle that could take place as early as next week, a senior 
official of his Sakigake (Harbinger) Party said Wednesday [23 
February]. The 14 Sakigake members in the House of 
Representatives met to discuss how to respond to Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's plan to reorganize his cabinet, said the 
official, who spoke on condition anonymity. 
  Another official of Sakigake, which Takemura leads, told 
reporters the party may break up if he declines to accept a 
different cabinet post. 
  The mass-circulation ASAHI SHIMBUN reported in its Wednesday 
morning edition that Takemura does not intend to accept a 
different cabinet post and is determined to leave the cabinet if 
he is sacked as chief cabinet secretary. 
  Hosokawa has indicated a desire to reorganize the 
six-month-old coalition cabinet at an early date and many 
political sources say the cabinet reshuffle is targeted at 
removing Takemura from his present key post. 
  The ASAHI said the prime minister has asked if Takemura 
could 
assume the post of foreign minister in place of Tsutomu Hata who 
would in turn take over as chief cabinet secretary. 
  The largest national daily, the YOMIURI SHIMBUN, reported 
that Hosokawa has decided to carry out the cabinet reshuffle 
early next week. The YOMIURI said Hosokawa aims to sack 
Takemura as chief cabinet secretary and Hirohisa Fujii as 
finance minister, and also solicit Social Democratic Party [SDP] 
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama into the cabinet. 
  The SDP, the largest among the seven ruling parties, has 
opposed an early cabinet reshuffle. But Shinseito and Komeito 
have offered support for the plan.
