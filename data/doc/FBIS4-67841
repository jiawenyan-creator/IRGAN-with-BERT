  [Text] Hiroshima, April 13 KYODO -- The head of the UN 
nuclear monitoring agency, Hans Blix, on Wednesday [13 April] 
urged the early completion of nuclear safeguards inspections in 
North Korea that a team of inspectors was prevented from 
concluding last month. 
  Blix, director general of the Vienna-based International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), stressed that it is necessary to 
check a radio chemical laboratory in the Yongbyon nuclear power 
complex about 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang and a 
5,000-kilowatt experimental reactor to complete the inspections. 
  Blix is in Hiroshima for the annual meeting of the Japan 
Atomic Industrial Forum, which this year is focusing on the 
theme of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide and promoting the 
peaceful uses of atomic energy. 
  IAEA inspectors were allowed in North Korea last month for 
their first look at North Korean nuclear facilities in more than 
a year in an effort to determine if radioactive materials had 
been diverted to military purposes. 
  Blix told reporters Wednesday that a check of the radio 
chemical laboratory was necessary to determine if it had been 
used since February 1993. 
  Blix also said that North Korea is nearing completion on 
construction of a second plutonium production line, which could 
double the North Korean output of the material needed in 
building an atomic bomb.
