SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
BLOCK GRANT BUDGET APPROVED 
The Lawndale City Council voted 3 to 1 last week to approve a budget for the 
city's 1989-90 Community Development Block Grant funds. The budget includes 
$45,731 for public service projects, $377,107 for a residential property 
rehabilitation program, and $64,716 for improvements such as curbing and 
underground utilities at the city's senior housing project, to be built at 
153rd Street and Condon Avenue. 
Acting Mayor Harold E. Hofmann opposed the city taking responsibility for the 
improvements at the senior project, but after some discussion he voted with 
Councilmen Larry Rudolph and Dan McKenzie to approve the budget. Councilwoman 
Carol Norman voted against the allocations, urging that some funds be set aside 
for a truancy program. 
Following the recommendation of a Citizens Advisory Committee, the council 
approved funds for graffiti removal, a senior nutrition program, the Center for 
Independent Living, South Bay Free Clinic, a center for the homeless called 
House of Yahweh and the South Bay Youth Service Center.
