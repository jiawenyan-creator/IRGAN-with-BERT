FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Cost cutting helps Lopex to Pounds 144,000
Lopex, the advertising and marketing services company, reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 144,000 for the first half of 1993. The comparable figure
was a loss of Pounds 602,000, restated for FRS 3, and after losses on
disposals of Pounds 477,000.
The pre-tax figure also benefited from lower interest charges of Pounds
187,000 (Pounds 465,000). However an increased tax charge of Pounds 270,000
(Pounds 136,000) contributed to retained losses of Pounds 141,000 (Pounds
766,000).
The company said there had been a big improvement in the UK largely due to
the cost savings programme. Losses per share were 0.38p (3.24p).
