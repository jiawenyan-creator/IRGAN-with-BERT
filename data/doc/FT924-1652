FT  17 DEC 92 / World Trade News: French to fight EC offer on farm trade
FRANCE yesterday launched a fierce attack on key farm offers by the European
Community in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, write Frances Williams
and Reuter in Geneva.
Mr Roland Dumas, foreign minister, said the detailed lists of tariffs on
agricultural products and a timetable for their introduction reflected the
recent 'totally unacceptable' EC-US accord.
Accusing the EC's agriculture and trade commissioners of 'disloyalty', he
said the list, submitted to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
which supervises the talks, was 'null and void'. The European Commission had
exceeded its negotiating mandate to stay within the bounds of planned EC
farm reforms.
Mr Dumas, who earlier met Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, said no
progress had been made in the Uruguay Round negotiations on non-agricultural
issues necessary to achieve a global and balanced accord. Farm negotiations
should not advance ahead of those on other baskets.
