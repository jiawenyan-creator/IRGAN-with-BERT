ALBERT BOWERS, 60; HEAD OF SYNTEX FIRM 
Albert Bowers, prominent scientist and chairman and former chief executive 
officer of Syntex, the Palo Alto-based pharmaceutical company, has died. He was 
60. 
Bowers died Thursday night at the UC San Francisco Medical Center after an 
extended battle with heart disease, the company announced Friday. 
Joining the company in 1956 as research group leader, Bowers published more 
than 90 scientific papers on steroid research and originated more than 120 U.S. 
patents. Among his major accomplishments were developing methods for the 
selective fluorination of steroids, which helped create topical ointments for 
treating skin diseases, and developing a special synthesis for norethindrone, 
which permitted large-scale manufacture of that oral contraceptive agent. 
Bowers became president of Syntex in 1976, was chief executive officer from 
1980 to 1989 and had served as chairman of the board since 1981. Because of 
poor health, he had planned to retire July 31. 
In 1964, Bowers received the Science Prize from the Mexican Academy of Science. 
He had served as chairman of the board of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 
Assn., the industry's national trade group. 
Born in Manchester, England, July 16, 1930, Bowers was graduated from London 
University with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and from the University of 
Manchester with a doctorate in organic chemistry. He did postdoctoral work in 
the United States on a Fulbright Fellowship. 
Bowers is survived by his wife, Gwynn Akin Bowers, his mother, five daughters, 
two brothers, a sister and two grandsons. 
The family has asked that any memorial contributions be made to the Foundation 
for Medicine, which funds research on heart disease, in care of Dr. Kanu 
Chatterjee, UC San Francisco, 505 Parnassus, Room 1186 of Moffitt Building, San 
Francisco, Calif. 94143.
