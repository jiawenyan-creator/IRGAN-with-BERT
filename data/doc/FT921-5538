FT  03 MAR 92 / Appointments: From merchant to high street bank
The old adage about not shooting the messenger seems to have fallen on deaf
ears at National Westminster Bank; it has just replaced its director of
corporate affairs less than a week after it reported its worst results since
1975.
Simon Lewis, the 32-year-old head of public relations at merchant bank S G
Warburg, is replacing Bill Beavor, a former Vietnam vet with a PhD in
military intelligence, who has departed after only 18 months.
Lewis started his career at Shandwick Consultants, the world's largest PR
firm, and was seconded to Warburg's former parent, Mercury Securities, in
the run-up to 'Big Bang'. After a leave of absence to head public relations
for David Owen's Social Democrat party ahead of the 1987 general election,
he returned to set up Warburg's public relations department. At NatWest, he
will be in charge of relations with the media, government and community. He
will have a staff of 50 and will report to Phil Wise, general manager of
group strategy and communications - the third person in that job in the past
18 months.
Lewis, an Oxford graduate and Fulbright scholar, is well regarded as a City
PR man. However, managing the public relations of a high street bank which
has had more than its fair share of bad publicity will be a far greater
challenge than handling the image of Britain's most successful merchant
bank, whose record speaks for itself. 'All the banks have had a difficult
time but the pr challenges now are greater than at any time in the cycle,'
Lewis says.
Meanwhile, NatWest refuses to comment on Beavor's abrupt departure save to
say that there were 'apparent differences in working methods and attitudes'.
Before joining NatWest, Beavor had been the late Robert Maxwell's chief
communicator for a brief spell and had also done stints at J Walter Thompson
and Dr Barnardo's, the children's charity. He also worked part-time at the
church of St John the Divine in Brixton.
