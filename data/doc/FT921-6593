FT  27 FEB 92 / Income of assisted parents revealed
MORE THAN a third of school pupils on the government's assisted places
scheme, which subsidises places at independent schools, come from families
earning above the national average wage, according to a study published
yesterday.
Based on a survey of 3,500 assisted-place pupils across Britain, it shows
that 35 per cent of families benefiting from the scheme had an income of
more than Pounds 15,000 a year, with 14 per cent earning more than Pounds
20,000 a year.
The scheme, which this year pays part or all of the school fees of 33,000
pupils, was established by the government in 1980 to enable children from
low-income families to go to the private sector.
It will cost nearly Pounds 65m this year and a planned Pounds 78m next year.
The Independent Schools Information Service, which commissioned the survey,
pointed to the 38 per cent of assisted pupils found to come from manual
working-class homes and the 32 per cent from families earning less than
Pounds 8,714 and receiving full assistance with fees.
