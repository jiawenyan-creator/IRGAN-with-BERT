  [Text] An event that is possibly linked to the Skrunda 
incident: On Monday evening at the closed Russian military unit 
in the Estonian town of Paldiski a fire broke out. At the 
Russian military unit the barracks were burned. The fire was 
brought under control after about 90 minutes. The Paldiski 
police were not allowed into the scene of the fire. Russian 
Army officers expressed the view that this was deliberate arson, 
motivated by the fact that part of the military site has been 
pulled down. Possibly the fire broke out as the result of 
soldiers' negligence.
