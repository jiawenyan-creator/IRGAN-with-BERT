FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: DHL seeks minority PAL stake
DHL Worldwide Express, the international express mail courier, is
negotiating to buy a minority interest in Philippine Airlines (PAL), the
country's flag carrier.
DHL is negotiating for a bloc of shares in the airline currently held by
three state institutions: Philippine National Bank, Development Bank of the
Philippines, and AFP Retirement and Separation Benefits System.
The three institutions own 20 per cent of PR Holdings, the consortium that
acquired 67 per cent of PAL for 9bn pesos (Dollars 334m) in a public offer
in January 1992. The 20 per cent holding in PR Holdings represents a 13 per
cent ownership of PAL.
DHL's interest in PAL was apparently prompted by the 1992 decision of rival
Federal Express to establish a hub for its Asian operations at the Subic Bay
freeport zone, the former US naval base. A tie-up would also expand DHL's
involvement in the airline industry.
The express courier company, based in Brussels, already has equity interests
in Guam-based Continental Air Micronesia.
On the other hand, PAL stands to gain, according to industry experts, from
DHL's business in cargo-handling in the US.
An earlier bid by Brunei Investment Agency, which is described as an
investment entity of the Sultan of Brunei, failed to take off because the
group also owns a majority stake in Malaysian Airlines, which PAL regards as
a competitor in regional traffic.
