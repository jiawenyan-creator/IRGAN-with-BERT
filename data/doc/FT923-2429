FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Alumasc ahead 23% to Pounds 7.2m
ALUMASC, the UK's largest beer keg manufacturer which also makes precision
components and specification building products, announced record profits in
the year to June 30.
The growth, however, reflected contributions from companies acquired during
1991 and interest on net cash holdings. Mr John McCall, chairman, said the
year 'disappointed all reasonable expectations of economic recovery.'
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.2m showed a 23 per cent improvement on the
comparable Pounds 5.85m. Net cash balances declined from Pounds 4.5m to
Pounds 3.4m but nonetheless produced net interest receivable of Pounds
254,000 (Pounds 268,000).
Turnover amounted to Pounds 45.3m (Pounds 41.8m), but the figure masked a
substantial change in the complexion of sales. The container and dispense
products division, which covers beer keg manufacture, sank to 30 per cent
(52 per cent) of the total, as demand from the brewing industry declined.
In contrast, turnover from specification building products rose to Pounds
20.9m (Pounds 11.3m) partly on acquisitions but also reflecting moves to
break away from dependence on the beer keg market, 'to be less dependent on
a single customer base,' as Mr McCall put it. 'I feel much less exposed than
I used to be five or six years ago,' he said.
Acquisitions pushed up total operating costs, but Mr McCall said that fixed
costs had been reduced in each of the individual businesses, stocks had been
cut and there were no bad debts.
Earnings per share rose 10 per cent to 31.3p; the proposed final dividend is
7.45p, bringing the total to 11p (10p).
Prospects for organic growth were not hopeful. 'Most of our market remain
depressed and hesitant,' Mr McCall said.
