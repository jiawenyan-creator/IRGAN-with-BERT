FT  11 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Rank Organisation
The leisure group, which announces first-half results on Thursday, is
expected to announce profits before exceptional charges of between Pounds
111m and Pounds 115m. This is expected to be balanced by exceptional charges
of Pounds 112m, relating to US video distribution closure costs and Rank's
share of the restructuring of Rank Xerox. The video duplication business is
thought to be going well.
