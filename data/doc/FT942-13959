FT  22 APR 94 / People: Sherwood Computer Services
Richard Guy, 45, executive chairman of USM-listed financial software company
Sherwood Computer Services, has precipitately departed following the
company's last annual figures revealing a Pounds 2m pre-tax loss after the
previous year's Pounds 3m profit. The company is expecting to find a
replacement for him but 'that will take perhaps six months', said a
spokesman.
Guy had been with Sherwood 17 years, becoming chief executive in 1988. He is
replaced with immediate effect, and in a non-executive capacity, by David
O'Brien, a non-executive director and currently chief executive of the
National and Provincial building society. George Matthews, 39, has been
chief executive since 1992.
Sherwood's recent poor performance is linked by the company to the recent
troubles on the Lloyd's insurance market, where it has a significant portion
of its business.
