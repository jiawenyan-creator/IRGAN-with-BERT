  [Text] Medellin (Colombia), 6 Feb (DPA) -- Military sources 
informed DPA that tonight a commando unit of the Simon Bolivar 
Guerrilla Coordinating Board (CGSB) attacked a Colombian Army 
base on the outskirts of the northwestern city of Medellin. 
  From positions in surrounding buildings and in the Medellin 
metro (under construction), some 20 snipers fired repeatedly at 
the Palermo Battalion installations, located in the densely 
populated Aranjuez sector. An elite Army corps known as the 
"men of steel" is trained at this base. Its members are tasked 
with patrolling Medellin's poorest neighborhoods, where crime 
has been rampant for the past few years. 
  Precisely in one of these neighborhoods today a clandestine 
armed group known as the "People's Militia" -- which was devoted 
to meting out "private justice" -- announced its disbandment. 
The "People's Militias" are accused of having committed 
hundreds of crimes against criminals, vagrants, and drug addicts 
who roam the streets of Medellin's poorest sectors. The Army's 
"men of steel" not only patrol these areas; they also help 
build schools, health care centers, and day care centers, and 
perform other social works. 
  The Army High Command has not issued any statement regarding 
the attack on this battalion, and there have been no reports 
regarding casualties.
