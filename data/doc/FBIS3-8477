  [Text] Tuzla, Bosnia-Herzegovina, March 9 (AFP) -- Three 
heavy mortar shells fell on the city centre on Wednesday, the 
first such attack in two weeks against the UN-protected 
north-east Bosnian city. 
  The shelling which shook the city and sent people scuttling 
indoors at 4:30 p.m. took place just a day after the city's 
airport was placed under UN control. 
  Alarm sirens screeched and an ambulance raced to the site of 
the attack but no immediate information was available on 
possible casualties. 
  Bosnian Serbs are dug into positions some 10 kilometres (six 
miles) from the city. 
  Troops from the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
officially took control Tuesday of the airport some 15 
kilometres (10 miles) outside the city in order to airlift aid 
to some 700,000 hungry civilians. 
  It was not immediately known whether or not the airport had 
been hit.
