Citicorp, the nation's biggest bank, said first-quarter profit fell to $231 
million, down 56% from a year earlier. The New York banking giant's problems 
stem from pressures on its corporate and investment banking business in Japan, 
Europe and North America, and a drop in Brazilian debt interest payments. It 
also has been hurt by the downturn in Northeast real estate values.
