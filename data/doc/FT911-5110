FT  16 APR 91 / Money Markets: No change in Spain
THE BANK of Spain left its money market intervention rate, the main
instrument of credit policy, unchanged at 13.50 per cent at a repurchase
tender for central bank certificates yesterday.
Friday's consumer price index for March indicated year-on-year inflation was
unchanged at 5.9 per cent. This was better than forecast, but the underlying
rate was still around 7.5 per cent. Nevertheless, the strength of the peseta
in the ERM had encouraged hopes that the Bank of Spain might cut its
intervention rate.
Overnight money firmed to 13.69 from 13.585 per cent after the tender and
one-week funds rose to 13.675 from 13.6125 per cent.
In London the short end of the money market showed little movement, but
longer rate were firm. Trading was quiet, lacking pressure for any further
change, after Friday's cut in bank base rates.
Three-month sterling interbank was quoted at 11 29/32 -11 27/32 against 11
15/16 -11 13/16 per cent previously. One-year money rose to 11 1/2 -11 3/8
from 11 7/16 -11 5/16 per cent.
The Bank of England initially forecast a money market credit shortage of
Pounds 850m. This was revised to Pounds 800m at noon, and was changed back
to Pounds 850m in the afternoon. Total assistance of Pounds 757m was
provided.
An early round of help was offered and at that time the authorities bought
Pounds 393m bills outright, by way of Pounds 100m bank bills in band 1 at 11
7/8 per cent and Pounds 293m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent.
Before lunch another Pounds 204m bank bills were purchased in band 2 at 11
13/16 per cent.
In the afternoon Pounds 80m bank bills were bought in band 2 at 11 13/16 per
cent and late assistance of around Pounds 80m was also provided.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 621m, with exchequer transactions absorbing
Pounds 675m and bank balances below target Pounds 155m. These outweighed a
fall in the note circulation adding Pounds 600m to liquidity.
In Frankfurt call money rose to 8.80 from 8.75 per cent, ahead of today's
terms for this week's securities repurchase agreement tender by the
Bundesbank. Dealers expect the central bank to offer one-month money at an
unchanged 8.60 per cent, and two-month funds at variable bid rates.
