FT  11 JUN 94 / Compensation law rejected
Germany's Upper House, which is dominated by the opposition Social
Democrats, yesterday threw out a draft law which would have granted a
limited right to compensation and restitution for some former property
owners in eastern Germany. The decision is likely to hold up investment in
the eastern states, particularly for agricultural land. The draft law,
passed after several attempts by the Bundestag, the lower house, last month
had aimed at resolving outstanding property rights disputes in eastern
Germany by allowing those whose land was expropriated by the Soviet
authorities, which had administered eastern Germany between 1945 and 1949,
the right to buy back back at reduced prices a certain amount of their
property.
Unlike those whose land was seized by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945, or by
the east German communists between 1949 and 1990, property owners between
1945 and 1949 had not been entitled to either restitution or compensation.
Many of them had owned vast tracts of land, especially in the northern state
of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and formed the backbone of Prussia's aristocratic
families. But the land had been expropriated by the Soviet authorities after
the second world war.
