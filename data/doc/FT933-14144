FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: TV network boosts CBS to Dollars
107.4m
CBS, which owns one of the three US television networks, posted unexpectedly
strong second-quarter earnings of Dollars 107.4m, or Dollars 6.73 a share.
The group predicted record earnings from continuing operations for the full
year.
A year earlier, CBS posted net earnings of Dollars 69m, or Dollars 4.46.
Earnings in the 1993 quarter included a one-time pre-tax gain of Dollars
14.2m. Sales grew to Dollars 835.8m from Dollars 779.9m.
On Wall Street, CBS shares closed at Dollars 245, a rise of Dollars 7 1/4 .
The improved earnings were attributed to better results from the company's
television network, benefiting from higher advertising sales, cost
containment and its leading position in the prime time market.
For the first half, CBS recorded net profits of Dollars 161.6m, or Dollars
10.23 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.71bn.
In the first six months of 1992, the group took charges for accounting
changes of Dollars 81.5m, which reduced net income to Dollars 5m, or 32
cents, on sales of Dollars 1.86bn.
Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman and chief executive, said the company's
television network saw sales grow by 8 per cent in the latest quarter.
He added that CBS expected to exceed significantly its record full-year
earnings from continuing operations of Dollars 11.54 a share, set in 1989.
