The body of former Raider John Matuszak was flown home to Milwaukee, where his 
family will hold funeral services Wednesday. 
The Raiders will also hold a memorial service, although no date has been 
announced. 
Matuszak, 38, died Saturday night after suffering heart failure. An autopsy by 
the Los Angeles County Coroner's office failed to determine the cause of death 
and a department spokesman said that the results of toxicology tests may not be 
known until next week.
