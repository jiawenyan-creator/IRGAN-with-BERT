FT  14 APR 92 / Chemical breaks ranks with cut in prime rate
CHEMICAL Bank, the New York-based banking group, cut its prime lending rate
yesterday from 6.5 to 6.25 per cent in an apparent attempt to get a head
start on rivals in the US commercial banking market, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The rate cut by Chemical was an unusual move. The big US commercial banks
traditionally change their prime rates in unison.
Chemical's decision to reduce the amount it charges on loans to favoured
customers follows the Fed's unexpected easing of monetary policy last
Thursday when the central bank signalled it wanted the federal funds rate -
at which banks borrow from each other - cut by a quarter of a percentage
point to 3.75 per cent.
A reduction in the Fed funds rate does not usually trigger cuts in prime
rates by big US commercial banks, which normally wait for the Fed to lower
the more important discount rate, at which the Fed charges banks for loans.
The discount rate is the Fed's most important monetary policy tool.
