  [Text] China's foreign trade has continued its 
double-digit growth in the first five months this year, to reach 
$76.77 billion, up 21.1 per cent over the same period last year, 
Customs officials said yesterday. 
  The export growth rate grew faster than that of imports, 
indicating that the ongoing reform to put the foreign trade 
system in line with international practice is paying off, 
according to officials in the General Administration of Customs 
(GAC). 
  Although China still saw a trade deficit of $1.79 billion 
during the period, it was $1.27 billion less than that in first 
five months of last year. 
  During the January-May period, China's total imports grew by 
18.1 per cent, amounting to $39.28 billion. The growth rate was 
slower than it was in the first four months of this year. 
Exports reached $37.49 billion, 24.1 per cent up. 
  Foreign-funded enterprises continued to set the pace in 
trade, as their exports and imports reached $28.29 billion, a 
43.4 per cent increase over the same period last year and 
accounting for nearly 37 per cent of the national trade volume. 
  The mix of China's exports continued its improvement as 
manufactured products witnessed a sharp rise of 27.6 per cent to 
$31.05 billion, accounting for more than 82 per cent of all 
exports. 
  Garments and textiles still topped the exports list, 
recording a 32 and 27 per cent lift with a volume of $7.76 
billion and $3.78 billion respectively, while machinery and 
electronics witnessed a rise of 30.1 per cent, totalling $9.27 
billion.
