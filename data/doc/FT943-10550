FT  04 AUG 94 / Observer: Open book
A treat in store for the hard-pressed board members of struggling speciality
retailer Pentos. Terry Maher, their erstwhile boss, rushes into print
recounting his version of events at the company he founded. The charmingly
titled Against my Better Judgment rolls off the presses at Sinclair
Stevenson on September 12.
So will Pentos's bookshops stock it? 'Certainly, we don't draw any lines
like that,' says current chairman Sir Kit McMahon expansively. He admits to
being as curious as anyone as to what Maher has to say for himself, while
adding that he doesn't believe Maher has 'quite taken on board' that he was
chairman of the company for 11 months of a year when it racked up losses of
Pounds 70m.
Sir Kit won't be wasting his own pennies on the tome, though. He plans to
head for a convenient Dillons and look up various salient points in the
index - starting presumably somewhere near the McM's.
