 

B. Exemption for Stock Dividend Transactions 



As proposed, the exemption for stock splits and stock dividends would be expanded to include specifically a stock
dividend in which equity securities of a different issuer are distributed.

115

 The primary application of this exemption would be to ``spinoff'' transactions, in which assets previously owned
by the issuer are distributed 

pro rata

 to shareholders in the form of equity securities of another issuer.

Proposed Rule 16a9(a). 
</FOOTNOTE>


The Division has interpreted the current rule to apply to stock splits or stock dividends involving the issuance,
on a 

pro rata

 basis, of a different class of equity securities of the same issuer.

116

 The business purposes generally motivating spinoff transactions and the fact that the securities distributed represent
assets owned indirectly by shareholders appear to justify further expanding this exemption to securities of a different
issuer.

C. Over-Allotment Options



Questions have arisen as to whether an over-allotment option written by an insider could be characterized as the establishment
of a put equivalent position and deemed sale of the underlying stock. Subsequent expiration of the unexercised option
arguably could constitute a purchase of the underlying security, matchable with the over-allotment option grant
or other sales by the insider within a six-month period. 
Recognizing that over-allotment options facilitate public offerings and do not lend themselves to the speculative
abuse Section 16 was designed to prevent, the staff issued interpretive relief to prevent this unintended result.

117

 The proposal would codify this relief by explicitly excluding over-allotment options from the derivative security
definition.

118

 Of course, a sale of securities to an underwriter upon exercise of the over-allotment option would remain a sale for
Section 16 purposes. Comment is solicited on whether additional conditions should be placed on the exclusion, such
as requiring that the option comply with all applicable regulations and policies of the National Association of Securities
Dealers.

V. Request for Comment 



Any interested person wishing to submit written comments on the proposed revisions to the Commission's Section 16
rules and forms, and compliance disclosure requirements, as well as on other matters that might have an impact on the
proposals contained herein, is requested to do so. In addition, the Commission requests comment on whether any further
changes to the Section 16 rules, particularly Rule 16b3, are necessary or appropriate at this time. Comment
is requested specifically from persons subject to Section 16; issuers whose officers, directors and ten percent
shareholders are subject to Section 16; and persons using the information afforded by the Section 16(a) reports.
The Commission also requests comment on whether the proposed rules, if adopted, would have an adverse impact on competition
or would impose a burden on competition that is neither necessary nor appropriate in furthering the purposes of the
Exchange Act. Comments responsive to this inquiry will be considered by the Commission in complying with its responsibilities
under Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act.

VI. Transition to New Rules 



If the proposed rule revisions are adopted, provisions for a transition from the current rules will be necessary,
particularly with respect to proposed Rule 16b3. Although the discussion below represents the Commission's
current intent regarding transition to the proposed revised rules, this schedule is subject to modification. 

The Commission intends to make the proposed rule amendments, other than those to Rule 16b3, effective with
respect to reports that are, or would have been, due on or after the 45th day following the date of adoption (the ``Effective
Date''), with earlier compliance permitted. Of course, to the extent that proposed rules codify interpretive positions,
those positions continue to be valid before the Effective Date. Trusts currently subject to Section 16 that would
be relieved of Section 16 obligations under the proposed rules would not be subject to any post-termination reporting
obligations or required to file a final Form 5. 

In extending the phase-in period for current Rule 16b3, the Commission stated that this period would continue
until September 1, 1994, or such earlier date as set in further rulemaking under Section 16. Given the timing of these
rule proposals, the Commission is extending the phase-in date until September 1, 1995 or such different date as set
in further rulemaking.

120

 Current and former Rule 16b3 would remain available until September 1, 1995,

121

 unless a different date is set by the Commission in the adopting release. Comment is solicited on how long a transition
period issuers and insiders would need, assuming adoption of the proposals. Of course, issuers continue to be permitted
to convert their plans to current Rule 16b3 at any time, provided that all plans of the issuer are converted.
After the phase-in date, issuers and insiders will no longer be able to rely on the former employee benefit plan exemptions,
but instead will need to comply with current Rule 16b3 (modified to the extent the Commission adopts these rule
proposals).

 Release No. 3434513, also issued today.

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>


121

</FOOTNAME>
The exemptions afforded by former Rules 16a8(b) and (g)(3) also would remain available. 

</FOOTNOTE>


Because proposed Rule 16a1(c)(8), which would exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' the
right or obligation to surrender a security or to have a security withheld in satisfaction of an exercise price or tax
withholding obligation, is inextricably linked to the proposed amendment of Rule 16b3(e), the Commission
proposes to link the availability of proposed Rule 16a1(c)(8) to conversion of the plan to proposed Rule 16b3.




VII. Cost-Benefit Analysis 



Commenters are requested to provide their views and data to assist the Commission in evaluating the costs and benefits
associated with the proposed amendments. It is expected that the amendments would decrease significantly the compliance
burden imposed on persons subject to Section 16 and attendant costs without undercutting the statutory objectives
of disclosing information concerning insider trading and discouraging speculative short-term insider trading.

The proposed simplification of the treatment of employee benefit plan transactions would constitute the most important
reduction in compliance burden. The proposed rules also would reduce compliance costs by: permitting joint and group
reporting where more than one person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities; providing that Section
16 applies to a trust only if the trust beneficially owns more than ten percent of a class of registered equity securities;
and limiting officers' and directors' post-termination reporting obligations. 

Furthermore, the proposed rules would expand the exemption for stock splits and stock dividends to include stock
dividends in which securities of a different issuer are distributed, and would provide a general exemption from reporting
and short-swing profit recovery for the disposition of securities 
pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order. 



VIII. Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 




An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 concerning the proposed
amendments. The analysis notes that the proposed amendments are intended to simplify the Section 16 regulatory scheme,
particularly with respect to employee benefit plans, and codify several staff interpretive positions. 

As discussed more fully in the analysis, most of the reporting persons the proposed amendments would affect are small
entities, as defined by the Commission's rules. The proposed amendments would decrease the reporting and compliance
requirements imposed upon corporate insiders subject to Section 16. 

The analysis discusses several possible alternatives to the proposed amendments including, among others, establishing
different compliance or reporting requirements for small entities or exempting them from all or part of the proposed
requirements. As discussed more fully in the analysis, implementation of any of these alternatives either would
be duplicative of the proposed amendments or inconsistent with the Exchange Act. 

Comments are encouraged on any aspect of the analysis. A copy of the analysis may be obtained by contacting Elizabeth
Murphy, Office of Disclosure Policy, Division of Corporation Finance, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.
