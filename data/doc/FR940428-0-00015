 

I. Rule 65: Expenditures in Connection With Solicitation of Proxies 



Rule 65, adopted under section 12(i) of the Act, generally requires prior Commission approval for certain expenditures
in connection with the solicitation of proxies by a company in a registered system.

41

 The rule currently provides an exemption for annual aggregate expenditures of $1,000. The proposed amendment would
increase the annual exemption to $100,000.

The commenters generally support this proposal. Columbia, however, asks the Commission to rescind the rule. The
commenter notes that regulated companies are already subject to the proxy solicitation rules under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934,

42

 and contends that there are no current abuses that justify the additional restrictions under the Act.

43

 Northeast asks the Commission to amend the rule to require only that proxy solicitations be conducted in conformity
with the Commission's proxy rules.

Columbia at 45. The commenter also asserted that the requirements of rule 65 are inconsistent with recent amendments
to the Commission's proxy rules that decrease regulation of communications among shareholders. 

See

 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 3431326, 57 FR 48276 (Oct. 22, 1992) (adopting amendments to the proxy
rules). 

</FOOTNOTE>


Both the proxy rules and rule 65 require the disclosure of the identity of paid solicitors and the cost of the solicitations.

44

 A proposal to rescind rule 65 may be an appropriate subject for a future rulemaking. In the meantime, however, the rule
is amended as proposed.

Holding Co. Act Release No. 2681 (Apr. 9, 1941) (rule 65 was intended to ``prevent substantial expenditures of corporate
funds by the management of a registered holding company to employ solicitors to aid them in obtaining proxies in a contested
election'').

J. Rule 71: Statements To Be Filed Pursuant to Section 12(i) of the Act 



Under section 12(i) of the Act, persons employed or retained by any registered holding company or its subsidiary,
who engage in activities before Congress, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``FERC'') or the Commission,
must disclose the nature and character of their employment and related compensation. Rule 71(a) currently requires
a report on Form U12(I)A within 10 days of the date of such activities.

45

 Rule 71(b) permits the filing of an advance statement on Form U12(I)B covering anticipated activities
for the remainder of the calendar year. The proposed amendment would lengthen the advance statement period to three
years.

The commenters generally support the amendment. CNG asks the Commission to clarify the types of persons that are required
to file under the rule. In general, support staff, such as secretarial staff, are not subject to the filing requirement,
in contrast to officers and attorneys who represent the companies.
