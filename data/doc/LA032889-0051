SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: SAN DIEGO BRIEFLY 
Two San Diego dancers are part of the American Ballet Theatre's 
eight-performance run at the San Diego Civic Theatre through Saturday. Dana 
Stackpole, a six-year veteran, and Laura Hood, who joined up with ABT less than 
two years ago, can be seen as members of the corps in "Swan Lake" and in 
several of the repertory works on tap for the troupe's San Diego stint.
