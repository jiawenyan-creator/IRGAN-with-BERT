FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bank of East Asia lifts interim
dividend
BANK OF East Asia, Hong Kong's third-largest stock market listed bank, has
increased first-half net profits by 22 per cent and will pay a higher
dividend.
Net profit after transfers to inner reserves amounted to HKDollars 198.2m
(USDollars 25.5m) for the six months to June, up from HKDollars 162.7m in
1992. The interim dividend is being increased from an adjusted 22.9 cents a
share to 27.5 cents.
The results were in line with analysts' expectations, and Mr David K. P. Li,
chief executive, predicted a strong performance from the banking industry in
the current six months.
Bank of East Asia traditionally launches Hong Kong's corporate reporting
season, and it is seen as heralding another impressive set of results from
the colony's banks.
In spite of the uncertainty from the Sino-British dispute over Governor
Chris Patten's political blueprint, the property market has recovered and
re-export growth has continued, providing momentum for domestic loan
portfolios.
Mr Li said: 'During the second half of 1993, domestic consumption and
investment are expected to pick up following a relatively quiet first half,
while the outlook for external trade is largely positive.'
However, gross interest margins for the banking sector overall have been
exceptionally wide over the past year, and in the face of increasing
competition analysts expect to see a reverse in this trend.
Winsor Industrial, the big textile group, yesterday disappointed stock
market expectations by announcing a 4 per cent decline in earnings for the
year ended March. Net profit amounted to HKDollars 262.1m, down from
HKDollars 271.8m in 1992.
The company has continued to focus its attention on relocating production
away from the colony, in the face of rising labour and land costs, and
increasing competition in slow export markets. Profit margins weakened
considerably in the second half of the year.
