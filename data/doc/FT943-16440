FT  05 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Soccer 'has lost to violence' says paper
With the murder of Colombian soccer star Andres Escobar, the sport had lost
out to violence, the Vatican newspaper said yesterday. An editorial in
L'Osservatore Romano said: 'Sports, which above all on the occasion of great
intercontinental events . . . ought to be the transmitter of universal
concepts of peace, brotherhood and loyalty, have become instead the occasion
for new violence.'
Escobar was gunned down in Medellin, Colombia. Escobar scored an own-goal
during a 2-1 loss to the US.
The memory of the 1994 World Cup, said L'Osservatore Romano, 'won't remain
that of a trophy gloriously raised to heaven, but that of a player, on the
ground, down-hearted after the own-goal, symbol of both desperation and of
death.'
