FT  10 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Carsberg's last call
It is perhaps unfortunate that Sir Bryan Carsberg could not be persuaded to
be more forthcoming ahead of the BT secondary offering last year. Had he
spelt out his thinking on pricing then, investors might have proved
distinctly less enthusiastic. The review turns out harsher than expected,
not only in terms of the price cap set at 7.5 percentage points below the
rate of inflation, but also because of its interventionist tone.
BT will almost certainly have to live with the result. Sir Bryan, who
vacates his post at the end of this week, has tied the hands of his
successor to his 'no-negotiation' approach. The alternative is a protracted
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry which could do considerable damage
to a public company with a market share of 93 per cent.
It would not do to lose all sense of perspective. Sir Bryan assumes a rate
of return well below the 19.3 per cent achieved last year, but the cost of
his measures, amounting to between Pounds 100m and Pounds 150m, compares
with annual profits of Pounds 3bn at present. BT has still to reap
significant gains from its rationalisation programme. Compared with the
industrial average it boasts a healthy dividend cover of more than 2 times
earnings.
There is a nagging worry just the same. In requiring BT to lay 3.5m
kilometres of optical fibre and to make digital services available to 99 per
cent of customers by 1997, Sir Bryan is limiting management's freedom to
decide the pace and application of investment. BT will face only a moderate
loss of market share at the end of the period. Indeed, the price cap may
well prove a competitive constraint on Mercury. But BT looks like remaining
at the mercy of a regulator bent on a view of his role which seems to go
beyond competition. The shares may have a little further to fall as this
point sinks in.
