  [Text] Commenting on the abduction of al-Hajj Mustafa 
al-Dirani, Housing and Cooperatives Minister Mahmud Abu Hamdan 
has condemned the Zionist act of piracy and urged unity against 
the Israeli crimes. He said the Israeli operation proves that 
no region in Lebanon is safe from the Israeli danger. He said 
the people must remain united to confront Israel and support 
resistance to serve the objectives of liberation. He said 
Israeli terrorism is nothing new and the latest operation in 
Qasr Naba proves that Israel is still the same and its talk of 
peace is a worthless illusion.
