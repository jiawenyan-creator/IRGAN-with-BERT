FT  25 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Criticism of banks over-heated
Sir, Mr Prodhan (Letters, October 22) joins the ranks of those whose
criticism of 'the banks' contains more heat than light.
Charges levied upon retailers are often far less than 4 per cent and are
negotiable. The cost and security implications to such retailers of dealing
with increased cash far outweigh the modest costs involved in accepting card
payments.
Some finance houses offer credit cards which allow monthly charging by
direct debit and involve no membership fee. Perhaps your correspondent
should transfer his allegiance.
Unfortunately, it seems that critics of the banks expect them to provide
their services free of charge. Perhaps Mr Prodhan will next be campaigning
for interest-free loans? Adrian Martin,
