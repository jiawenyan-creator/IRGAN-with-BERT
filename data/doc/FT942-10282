FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Chesterfield shares rise on 63% net assets
increase
Shares of Chesterfield Properties yesterday rose 12p to 613p after the
company announced a 63 per cent rise to 650p in its net asset value per
share as at December 31.
The figure partly reflected the write-back of a Pounds 25.7m provision in
the previous year; the investment property portfolio increased by 17 per
cent in value, with its central London component improving by 24 per cent.
Pre-tax profits leapt to Pounds 37.4m in 1993, compared with a restated loss
of Pounds 18.1m. Excluding the write-back, profits rose 7 per cent to Pounds
8.2m.
The group's entertainment interests, which range from its three Curzon
cinemas to a number of West End theatres, suffered from a Pounds 500,000
provision for bad debt and contributed a loss of Pounds 1m.
Rental income fell from Pounds 36.1m to Pounds 26.9m reflecting property
disposals. Mr David Kiernan, finance director, said one further small
property disposal was under consideration, but the company was seeking
acquisitions.
Net debt amounted to Pounds 160m at the year end, representing gearing of
102 per cent, less than half the 1992 figure.
The company's Pounds 56m of development properties are still valued at cost,
with Pounds 30m of these in the US. Mr Kiernan was confident that this
reflected current market value, and no provisions would be required.
A proposed final dividend of 8p makes a total of 12p (11p). Earnings per
share were 171.54p, of which 137p was accounted for by the revaluation.
