FT  15 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Rhone-Poulenc
Another profits warning from Rhone-Poulenc does not inspire confidence that
management has its finger on the pulse. Until the autumn, the company was
predicting profits growth of more than 15 per cent for 1992. Now the
increase may be little more than 5 per cent. The downturn in chemicals in
the final months of the year must have caught the company on the hop; the
fact that the news broke in an unplanned press report also seems careless.
The broader question is whether the announcement clears the way for the
French government's privatisation share offering or is the final nail in its
coffin. Since the offer document contains nothing concrete by way of a
profits forecast, there is no binding reason not to proceed before the
February 1 deadline. But the non-voting shares yesterday slid back towards
FFr500 - a level at which the government has so far been unwilling to sell.
Even if the government changed its mind on that, the market will now take
some convincing that all the bad news is out. The company argues that
deferred sales of agrochemicals will boost profits this year. The
combination of a US economic upturn and a stronger dollar should help it
ride out the downturn in Europe from here on. After yesterday, though,
investors may have their doubts.
