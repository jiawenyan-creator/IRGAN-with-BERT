FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Deficit of SFr116m at Swissair
SWISSAIR, the Swiss national airline, has reported an operating loss after
depreciation of SFr116m (Dollars 88m) in the first half compared with a loss
of SFr97m in the same period last year.
However, the group forecast that it would make a net profit for the year,
helped again by aircraft and other asset sales, and the result would be
'broadly in line' with last year's SFr83m.
The airline, which is in the midst of a four-year programme to strip SFr300m
out of annual costs, said the first half results reflected sluggish demand,
overcapacity and drastic reductions in fares worldwide.
Total traffic volume was up only 8 per cent, significantly less than the
European airline average, but Swissair said its volume in the first half of
last year during the Gulf War fell less than that of its rivals.
Revenue was up 5 per cent to SFr2.5bn, but the overall load factor slipped
to 59.3 per cent and revenue per passenger declined, resulting in a
continuing loss. Last year, the airline's break-even point was 64 per cent.
Swissair said its overall costs rose 5 per cent in the first half, and
depreciation charges were up by SFr14m to SFr197m.
