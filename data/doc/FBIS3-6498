  [Text] Seoul, March 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has high 
hopes for 1994 exports to its biggest market, the United States, 
since the major economic power expects economic growth of 3 
percent this year, the highest since 1988, the Korea Foreign 
Trade Association (KFTA) said Friday. 
  U.S. imports are expected to increase up to 10 percent this 
year because the economic recovery is fueled chiefly by rising 
consumption and investment rather than growth in exports, KFTA 
officials said. Korea's exports to the United States, which have 
recorded losses or less than 1 percent growth since 1989, are 
expected to rise as much as 5 percent to total 19 billion U.S. 
dollars, the officials said. 
  Sunny skies are forecast for exports of electronics, 
machinery and motor vehicles, but the prospects for textiles 
remain cloudy due to weakening competitiveness, they said.
