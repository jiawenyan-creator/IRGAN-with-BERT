  [Text] Brussels, February 9 (XINHUA) -- The North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO) today warned the Bosnian Serbs that 
they would face air strikes unless they lift their siege of 
Sarajevo within 10 days. 
  NATO said in a statement the strikes would take place 10 
days 
from 2400 GMT Thursday if the ultimatum was not met. 
  Earlier, the United Nations said that the three warring 
parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina had reached a ceasefire agreement 
in and around Sarajevo through the mediation of U.N. 
representatives. 
  The Serbs pledged to withdraw their artillery from around 
the 
city and put the guns under U.N. monitoring. 
  It is reported that NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner 
had immediately informed U.N. chief Butrus Butrus-Ghali of the 
decision made at a meeting of the NATO ambassadors today. 
  Butrus-Ghali had asked NATO to get prepared for air strikes 
following a mortar shelling against an open-market in Sarajevo 
last Saturday that killed 68 people and wounded nearly 200 
others. 
  The NATO statement said the ultimatum was given in close 
cooperation with the U.N. chief.
