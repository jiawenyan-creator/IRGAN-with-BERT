WRITERS AND AGEISM 
Regarding Mary Helen Berg's "Ageism Thwarts Older Writers in Hollywood" (Dec. 
7): 
It comes as no surprise to television viewers and moviegoers that the Pepsi 
generation is now at the helm of the good ship Hollywood. Young writers and 
producers, along with their co-conspirators at the corporate level, form a Cult 
of Mediocrity concerned primarily with recycling the television of their 
sainted childhoods. 
This sad state of affairs will remain unchanged as long as young writers are 
hired instead of good writers, regardless of age. With Hollywood versions of 
Dan Quayle burdening every executive office in Hollywood there is little hope 
for the future.
