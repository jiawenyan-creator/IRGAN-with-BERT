  [Text] Yuriy Kostenko, Ukraine's environmental protection 
minister, on 4 May met representatives of a G-7 mission, which 
is on a visit to Ukraine. The visitors took interest in the 
problem of closing down the Chernobyl nuclear power plant as 
soon as possible and other issues relating to the use of 
radioactive materials in Ukraine. By closing down the Chernobyl 
AES, in the view of the mission's representatives, Ukraine would 
make a considerable contribution to guaranteeing the ecological 
safety of Europe. 
  Yuriy Kostenko said MinPryrody [Environmental Protection 
Ministry] was steadily insistent on the plant's closure. 
Because of Ukraine's complex economic situation, however, a 
speedy settlement to the issue, in the minister's view, is only 
possible given adequate financial and technological assistance 
from the G-7 countries. 
  As for the future of radioactive waste and used nuclear 
fuel, 
Yuriy Kostenko said that the only possible way for Ukraine now 
was to store them in makeshift depots until a national nuclear 
waste repository would be built.
