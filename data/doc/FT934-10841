FT  03 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Efim bank creditors set for
repayments
BANK creditors to Efim, the Italian state holding company put into voluntary
liquidation in July 1992, may be on the brink of receiving their first
repayments.
A first tranche of more than L2,170bn should be paid shortly following the
signature in late October of a special decree by Mr Piero Barucci, treasury
minister.
The repayment will be made in the form of government bonds. The five-year
government bonds being paid to creditors will carry a coupon of 6.20 per
cent.
Once necessary bureaucratic procedures are completed, between L1,450bn and
L1,500bn will be reimbursed to around 20 Italian creditor banks.
Separately, Banca Commerciale Italiana, the bank which is to move from state
control into the private sector and which is an agent for Efim, will receive
about L700bn for on-payment to non-bank creditors.
The first of Efim's major repayments still leaves most foreign bank
creditors in the cold, however.
Last month, a separate treasury decree authorised preliminary payments of
L225bn, also in the form of government bonds, to a number of domestic and
foreign banks. However, the bulk of Efim's foreign bank creditors are
awaiting reimbursement of their loans, which are due to be repaid in a
variety of foreign currencies rather than lira bonds.
The latest decree opens the door to the first big reimbursement of creditors
since Efim went into liquidation.
In spite of the repeated promise of speedy repayment by Efim, reimbursements
have been bogged down by bureaucratic problems, notably the tussle between
the Italian government and the European commission in Brussels over alleged
illegal state aid.
