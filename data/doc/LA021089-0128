Angola accused South Africa of sending troops back into southern Angola in 
violation of peace accords signed last December. South Africa immediately 
denied the allegation. An Angolan communique, signed by Defense Minister Pedro 
Maria Tonha, said the South African forces shelled Angolan army units south of 
Caiundo in Cuando Cubango province. It gave no details of any casualties.
