TRIAL IN FATAL MARTIN CRASH BEGINS 
Jury selection began today in the trial of a Detroit bar owner charged with 
drunk driving in the crash that killed New York Yankees manager Billy Martin 
last Christmas. 
William Reedy, 53, a longtime friend of the five-time Yankees manager, is 
charged with driving while intoxicated. 
The selection of jurors is expected to take the entire day and the trial could 
last up to seven days, Town of Fenton court clerk Brooke Dean said. 
Reedy, who owns Reedy's Bar near Tiger Stadium, pleaded innocent to the 
drunk-driving charge in January. Broome County District Attorney Gerald Mollen 
and Reedy's lawyer, Jon Blechman, have refused to reveal the results of a 
voluntary blood-alcohol test taken by Reedy. 
Martin's wife, Jilluann, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the town of 
Fenton and Reedy.
