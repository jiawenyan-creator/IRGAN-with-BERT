FT  18 DEC 92 / International consortium wins satellite contract worth
Dollars 1.7bn
ARGENTINA has awarded a contract worth Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn) to
build, launch and operate its first domestic communications satellite to a
five-company international consortium, which is expected to put the
satellite in orbit by 1996.
Since Argentina has already privatised nearly all its telecommunications
services, the government in effect picked the operators of what will be a
privately operated satellite communications system, which will have the
right to use both of Argentina's now unused satellite allocations.
The consortium - in which France's Aerospatiale and Alcatel, Alenia Spazio
of Italy, Embratel of Brazil and Deutsche Aerospace all have a 20 per cent
stake - will be responsible for designing, building, launching and operating
the satellite.
Building and launch costs are estimated at Dollars 200m. Earth stations and
infrastructure should cost a further Dollars 1.5bn.
