  [Text] Washington, March 21 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton said today that the United States will send Patriot 
air-defense missiles to South Korea. 
  "It is our national interest and in the interest of the 
security of the people of South Korea and the security of our 
armed forces there to send Patriot missiles at this time and we 
are going to do that," Clinton told reporters when he arrived in 
Deerfield Beach, Florida, for a health care meeting. 
  Clinton described the deployment as "purely defensive in 
nature" and as part of a continued modernization of U.S. armed 
forces in South Korea. 
  There are about 37,000 American military forces in South 
Korea. 
  The United States has also decided to resume a joint 
military 
exercise with South Korea and suspended the third round of 
formal talks scheduled today in Geneva with the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). 
  "As to the next issues, I think we just have to wait and see 
what will happen. I can't say more today," Clinton claimed.
