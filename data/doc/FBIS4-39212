  [Text] Riga, Jun 04, BNS -- Latvian Communication Minister 
Andris Gutmanis and Norwegian Ambassador Torbjorn Olbu signed 
Friday a bilateral agreement on international auto 
transportation. 
  The agreement is designed to promote passenger and freight 
transports between the two countries, as well as transit via 
their territories, the Riga-based DIENA newspaper reported. 
  Latvia and Norway have already started successful 
cooperation 
by signing a contract on the supply of Norwegian Alkatel firm's 
telecommunications equipment to Latvia in the framework of the 
Tilts program. 
  Olbu claims that Latvian and Norwegian cooperation will 
broaden in the future, especially in the sphere of 
telecomunications. 
  The signed agreement takes effect starting with the day of 
its signature and remains valid until any of the parties 
announce an intention to break it six months in advance.
