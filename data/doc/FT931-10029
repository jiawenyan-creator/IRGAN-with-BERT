FT  10 FEB 93 / Insurers may widen terrorist cover
INSURERS may allow 'captive' insurance companies to become members of Pool
Re, the mutual insurance company they are setting up to provide cover
against terrorist attack. This would avert a potential conflict with
commercial insurance buyers.
Insurers had intended to exclude captives - subsidiaries set up largely to
insure the risks of industrial and commercial companies - from membership.
Risk managers said their exclusion could leave many of Britain's biggest
companies without insurance protection against terrorist attack.
The Association of British Insurers said the issue of how captives should
join would be high on the agenda of Mr Eric Coward, a former Sun Alliance
director who will be Pool Re chief executive.
