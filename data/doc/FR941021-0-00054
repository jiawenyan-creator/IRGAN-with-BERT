Final rule. 
 


 
 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule amends the regulatory program of the Minerals Management Service (MMS) to state specifically the authority
of MMS to require lessees or operators to conduct archaeological resource surveys and submit reports prior to exploration,
development and production, or installation of lease term or right-of-way pipelines. This rule also standardizes
the definition and use of the term ``archaeological resources'' within MMS's regulatory program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Since 1973, the Department of the Interior (DOI) has included a stipulation on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) mineral
lease tracts to notify potential lessees that, where applicable, archaeological resource surveys and reports will
be required. Lessees and operators have, since that time, submitted this information when the stipulation was invoked
by MMS. 
 
 
 


The authority to require this information was identified, in a general fashion, in a final rule published by MMS in
the 

Federal Register

 on April 1, 1988 (53 FR 10596). That rule granted authority to MMS Regions to ensure safety and environmental protection
by requiring OCS lessees and operators to conduct needed surveys and submit reports when seeking approval of their
plans to explore or develop and produce hydrocarbons or to install lease term or right-of-way pipelines. 
 
The MMS Regions issue further guidance in the form of Notices to Lessees and Operators (NTL's). These NTL's provide
detailed information on archaeological resource requirements. 
 
In order to convert the requirements contained in the archaeological lease stipulation into regulations, a proposed
rule was published by MMS on October 12, 1993 (58 FR 52731). The proposed rule sought to grant specific authority to
each MMS Regional Director to require archaeological resource surveys and reports. The proposed rule also made minor
modifications in 30 CFR parts 256 and 280 to standardize the use of the term ``archaeological resource,'' eliminate
use of other terms such as ``cultural resources,'' and provide uniform definitions. The routine requirements for
surveys and reports that were proposed in 30 CFR 250.26 are not located in 250.33 and 250.34. These surveys
and reports, when required, will normally be included in the exploration report or the development and production
report. Since 250.33 and 250.34 pertain to Exploration Plan and Development and Production Plan respectively,
the change will help to clarify the requirements. 
 
The comments received during the public comment period were reviewed, and an analysis was conducted within MMS. The
following is a discussion of the responses to comments received and any resultant text changes.
