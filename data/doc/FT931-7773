FT  23 FEB 93 / Beaches found to be dirtier
BEACHES and coasts are dirtier than they were last year, according to a
survey by Norwich Union Coastwatch.
Almost half the 2,185km of coastline - 15 per cent of Britain's total -
surveyed by more than 6,000 volunteers showed evidence of litter and
pollution in an 'alarming decline' of cleanliness.
Ms Kathy Pond of Coastwatch said parts of the Scottish coastlines were among
the worst affected by sewage.
