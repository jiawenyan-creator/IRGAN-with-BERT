FT  17 OCT 94 / International Company News: Frankfurt SE cuts seat prices
The Frankfurt Stock Exchange has cut the price of floor seats by more than
half and reduced its electronic order-routing fees to make trading cheaper
and more liquid.
Under new rules passed Friday, traders abroad will also eventually be able
to join the IBIS electronic trading system. The exchange - accounting for
three-quarters of business on Germany's seven stock markets - said interest
in IBIS membership had been shown from London, Amsterdam and Paris in
particular, and from Switzerland and Luxembourg.
The fee for admission to floor-trading has been cut from DM500,000 (Dollars
322,580) to DM200,000, with brokers' fees down from DM200,000 to DM80,000.
The DM15,000 admission fee for individual traders has also been removed.
The exchange's current membership comprises 138 banks (half foreign and half
German) and 97 brokers.
Mr Werner Seifert, chief executive of Deutsche Borse AG, which operates the
Frankfurt exchange said: 'Our goal is to offer cheaper and more liquid
trading than all other markets in German securities.'
Members using only the electronic order-routing system will pay half the
annual DM24,000 trading fee; the annual fee of DM3,000 per trader has also
been waived.
