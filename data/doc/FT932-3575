FT  14 JUN 93 / Hope for two BES schemes
NATIONAL Westminster Bank and BZW, the securities house owned by Barclays
Bank, may earn a reprieve for their business expansion schemes which failed
to qualify for tax relief after Budget changes.
Mr John Watts, the conservative MP and chairman of the Treasury select
committee, has tabled a proposed amendment to the Finance Bill which would
make the schemes eligible for tax relief.
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, said in his Budget speech that
shares in BES companies had to be issued by midnight before the Budget if
loans were to be made against them.
Non-recourse loans allowed investors to withdraw their investments after
only six months instead of five years, while retaining full BES tax relief
at their top marginal rate. This tax relief was intended to be available
only to those who maintained their investment for five years.
BZW's Gracechurch companies were launched at the end of February and raised
their full subscription of Pounds 25m. NatWest's Homeshare scheme was
launched in the first week of March and raised the full subscription of
Pounds 25m. The shareholdings were not listed in the companies' register of
members by the Budget deadline.
