A'S SEEK ESCAPE IF RAIDERS RETURN 
The World Series champion Athletics are considering a plan to leave Oakland if 
the city succeeds in wooing the Raiders back to the San Francisco Bay area. 
The A's want the right to leave after the 1995 season if the city gets the 
Raiders back, according to city officials. 
The A's also requested a package of rent concessions and loan deferrals that 
would cost the city and Alameda County about $1.5 million per year if Oakland's 
latest return-the-Raiders plan works. 
The proposed changes in the lease would be in addition to a series of lease 
improvements, valued at about another $1 million per year, that the A's 
obtained from the city in May. 
A's President Wally Haas said Tuesday that the team wanted the new package 
because the club could suffer considerable financial losses competing for fans 
with the Raiders.
