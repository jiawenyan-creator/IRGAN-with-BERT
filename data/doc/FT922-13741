FT  10 APR 92 / Fine weather signals high poll turnout
FINE weather across the country promised a high turnout in yesterday's UK
general election, the closest contest for decades with the Conservative and
Labour parties running neck and neck, writes Richard Evans.
The Tory and Labour leaders, Mr John Major and Mr Neil Kinnock, both
maintained confidence that victory was just hours away.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, pictured after voting early this morning in his Yeovil
constituency, although confident of a high vote for the Liberal Democrats
said he had election day jitters.
With the Conservatives seeking a fourth consecutive term, Labour anxious to
regain power after 13 years in opposition and the Liberal Democrats gambling
on a hung parliament, there was a great deal at stake.
The fine balance as voting finished was shown by estimates from bookmakers
that of the Pounds 7m in bets placed, 45 per cent had gone on a Labour
victory and 45 per cent on a Tory win.
