FT  29 DEC 94 / India approves investments
The Indian government yesterday cleared 27 proposals for foreign investment
worth Rs1.4bn (Pounds 28m). They include a joint venture between Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, and the New Delhi-based Hindustan Times group
to produce television and video programmes in India, and the setting up of
two subsidiary companies by Morgan Stanley. Pearson and the Hindustan Times
media group, owned by the Birla family, will set up film and television
production facilities in India with a third partner, the Hong Kong-based
Television Broadcast (TVB). Clearance for the TV venture comes at a time
when the entry of foreign companies into the print media is being hotly
debated. Pearson's proposal for a joint venture between the FT and the
Ananda Bazaar Patrika group's Business Standard newspaper has yet to be
approved. The Hindustan Times-Pearson proposal has assured the government
that it will not undertake any print media-related activities.
