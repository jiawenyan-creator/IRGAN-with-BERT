FT  13 JAN 92 / Zhelev leads in Bulgarian poll
PRESIDENT Zhelyu Zhelev had a clear lead but was well short of a first-round
victory in Bulgaria's first presidential elections yesterday, preliminary
estimates showed, Reuter reports from Sofia.
Mr Zhelev, former leader of the governing Union of Democratic Forces, was
set to take about 44 per cent of the vote, according to projections based on
partial results.
That would put him well ahead of his nearest rival, Mr Velko Valkanov, but
short of the 50 per cent needed to avoid a second round of voting next
Sunday.
