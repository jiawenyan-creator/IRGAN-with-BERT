FT  15 JAN 92 / Moscow prosecutors charge 13 over Soviet coup
Prosecutors yesterday formally charged 13 people, including the former
Soviet prime minister, KGB chief and defence minister, with conspiracy to
seize power during the failed coup in August that led to the downfall of the
Soviet Union, AP-DJ reports from Moscow. Some could face the death penalty.
No trial date has been set.
The charges cap a four-month investigation and the gathering of 125 volumes
of evidence, the Tass news agency said. In addition to the alleged plotters,
the actions of the KGB, the armed forces, and Communist party and other
institutions were reviewed, Tass said. Among those charged were former
Soviet KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov, prime minister Valentin Pavlov, defence
minister Dmitri Yazov, Supreme Soviet chairman Anatoly Lukyanov and
vice-president Gennady Yanayev. All but two of the 13 suspects remain in
prison. Ex-KGB Gen Viktor Grushko and the former chief of staff to former
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, Valery Boldin, have been freed and sent
to hospitals on health grounds.
