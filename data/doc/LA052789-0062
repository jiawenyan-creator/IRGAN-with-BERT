CHINESE STUDENTS PROTEST IN BEIJING 
The Chinese government has fallen victim to student protesting. It is 
commendable that the citizens of this communist country are trying to achieve 
what our forefathers did for us over 200 years ago. The students say that they 
are protesting for "democracy" and "freedom" -- for better living conditions, 
for more dormitory space, for better food. These students are guilty of lacking 
every conceivable notion as to what democracy is. 
One student, appearing on the CBS "Evening News" with Dan Rather from Beijing, 
said that she graduated from high school as a chemistry student and then 
subsequently entered Beijing University (one of the best in China). She is 
halfway through with her studies and complained to Rather that the unviersity 
limits her freedom by not allowing her to change majors. She fails to 
understand her government has invested a lot of time and money into her 
education that could have been spent on someone else. It cannot be wasted on 
her changing her mind. In the U.S., everyone is given an opportunity for a 
college education, but not so in China; but for the few elite that do, it is 
free. 
The protesting students fail to realize that there is a price to pay for 
democracy and freedom, and it's not just of monetary value. Our country is 
paying that price in the drug problems of every city, especially our nation's 
capital; there is plenty of crime. The students don't even know what democracy 
is, and they are crying for it. 
Many of the students in Tian An Men Square are calling for the resignation of 
China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping. It is ludicrous that they don't remember 
that only a decade ago Deng was able to bring reforms of modernization and 
relaxing of communist pressures against the people. Without such reforms, they 
would not be able to be protesting. 
The Education Commission should not stand for the petulance of these students.
