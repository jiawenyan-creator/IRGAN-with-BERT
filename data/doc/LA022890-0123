SOUTHERN SECTION BOYS' SOCCER PLAYOFFS; 
3-A; 
MEJIA'S GRAND ENTRANCE HELPS EL TORO ADVANCE 
Al Mejia of El Toro High School made his coach look good in the second half of 
Tuesday's Southern Section 3-A semifinal boys' soccer match against Redlands. 
Only two minutes after entering the game, Mejia scored to give El Toro a 1-0 
victory over Redlands. 
The Chargers (14-3-2) will make their first appearance in a Southern Section 
boys' soccer final. They will meet San Gabriel Valley League champion Cerritos 
Saturday at 8 p.m. at Gahr High School. 
"We play in a tough league with Mission Viejo and Dana Hills," Coach Carlos 
Arce said, "but Redlands was a very tough team too. They were very physical and 
forced us to play with discipline. We've faced physical teams before, but no 
one with as much skill." 
Seventeen minutes into the second half Barry crossed a pass from the right 
corner and Mejia drilled it past Redlands goalkeeper Jim Moran to give El Toro 
the only goal it would need. Redlands finished the season 21-5-2. 
El Toro goalkeeper Kevin Rowe, a two-time All-South Coast League selection, 
recorded eight saves for his second shutout of the playoffs.
