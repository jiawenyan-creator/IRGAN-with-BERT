  [Text] Seoul, March 28 (YONHAP) -- A Defense Ministry 
official on Monday denied the ASAHI SHIMBUN report that South 
Korea seems to have cancelled its plan to resume the '94 Team 
Spirit military exercise. 
  "No decision has been made on such a cancellation," the 
official said. 
  In a dispatch from Seoul, the Japanese daily said Monday it 
appears South Korea scrapped a plan to resume the '94 Team 
Spirit military exercise, a plan which Seoul made following 
North Korea's rejection of overall nuclear inspection by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  ASAHI said that a final decision on the withdrawal of the 
plan to resume the joint Korea-U.S. exercise would be made after 
South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, now accompanying 
President Kim Yong-sam to China, would fly to Washington 
following his Beijing visit and inform the U.S. of the Seoul 
decision.
