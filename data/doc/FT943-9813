FT  09 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Great Southern
All parties involved in the wrangle over the bidding for Great Southern are
agreed on one thing - the proposed solution hammered out by the Takeover
Panel and SCI does not disadvantage any group of shareholders. Nor is there
any suggestion that SCI's advisers prevented investors getting the best
possible deal because of the wording of its 'final' offer. Most assumed that
the offer was final only on condition that there was no competing, higher
bid even though this was not spelled out. Shareholders who asked were told
of this. Those who then sold in the market are to be compensated. They can
hardly complain.
The main principles of the Takeover Code are not compromised. The proposed
solution conforms to the letter of the Code which gives the Panel discretion
to allow a final offer to be amended in exceptional circumstances. The
question is whether the loose wording was a mistake by SCI's advisers or a
tactic. It is hard to believe that an adviser of Schroders' stature would
set out blatantly to mislead. Even so, the Panel should guard against
setting a precedent.
