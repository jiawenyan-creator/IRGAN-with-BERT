A FULL MEASURE OF HEROISM 
Day-to-day life would be immeasurably harder and perhaps even unendurable if we 
weren't able to take for granted a lot of things, among them that the crews of 
the airliners we fly know their business. The safe end of an air journey seldom 
brings even a passing thought of appreciation for the skills of those who flew 
the plane. Only during and after those mercifully rare times when emergencies 
occur and special and even extraordinary efforts are called for are we apt to 
recall how often and with what implicit and absolute trust we temporarily place 
our lives into the hands of strangers. 
When United Air Lines Flight 232 took off from Denver on the afternoon of July 
19, Alfred C. Haynes, Dudley Dvoark, William R. Records and Dennis Fitch were 
strangers to virtually all the passengers aboard. A few hours later, for many 
of them, the four men were their saviors. 
Haynes was the pilot, Records was the first officer, Dvorak the second officer, 
and Fitch was an off-duty United pilot who lent two strong hands when their 
DC-10 suffered an engine explosion and loss of hydraulic controls. Somehow, 
working together, they were able to steer the crippled plane to a crash 
landing. The crash took the lives of 111 people. But, seemingly against all 
odds, 185 of those aboard survived. They lived not because Haynes and his 
colleagues followed the procedures for dealing with such an emergency -- no 
such instructions exist -- but because, faced with a crisis they stayed calm, 
they called on their extensive experience, they improvised. Haynes said at a 
press conference a week after the crash that there were no heroes in the 
cockpit. He was wrong. Cool professional competence under terrifying pressure 
is as good a definition of heroism that we know of. There was a lot of heroism 
aboard UAL Flight 232. Because there was, 185 people beat some pretty long odds 
and are alive today.
