  [Text] The detention and deportation to the Latvian border 
of Russian army generals Nikolay Taylakov and Anatoliy 
Vodopyanov is right now being discussed at an extraordinary 
meeting of the Council of Ministers. 
  Consultations between representatives and experts of the 
delegations for the Latvian-Russian interstate talks on the 
dismantling of the Skrunda radar station were scheduled for 
today, but Sergey Zotov, head of the Russian delegation, said on 
his arrival in Latvia that the talks will not resume until the 
incident has been clarified and relevant permission received 
from the Russian leadership. 
  According to the Latvian Foreign Ministry's press center, 
representatives of the delegations have nevertheless agreed to 
meet at 1000 tomorrow.
