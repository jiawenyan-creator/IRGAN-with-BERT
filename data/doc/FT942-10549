FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Babcock ends year with Pounds 41m deficit
Babcock International, the engineering contracting and materials handling
group, yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 41.2m for the year ended
March 31, compared with a profit of Pounds 21.1m last time.
The result is exactly in line with preliminary estimates announced on April
21, when Babcock unveiled a 4-for-7 rights issue to raise about Pounds
78.6m, a new three-year corporate plan and a major restructuring of its
energy division.
The shake-out, involving 420 more job cuts at Babcock's Renfrew plant in
Scotland, produced a Pounds 25m provision for restructuring, the main reason
for the sharp fall into loss.
There was also a Pounds 7.9m provision on discontinued businesses in South
Africa, offset by credits totalling Pounds 3.4m.
Before the exceptional items, the pre-tax loss was Pounds 11.7m (Pounds
34.1m profit). Turnover rose from Pounds 748m to Pounds 805m, of which all
but Pounds 3.7m came from continuing businesses.
As stated last month, Babcock is not paying a final dividend - it paid no
interim either. The board said it would resume payments once the group's
performance has improved in line with the expected benefits of the new
corporate plan.
After tax and minorities, the retained loss for the year was Pounds 45.5m,
compared with a deficit of Pounds 2.02m in 1992/93. Losses per share, on a
net basis, were 8.46p, compared with earnings of 1.72p.
Babcock also yesterday issued a pro-forma balance sheet showing the effect
of the rights issue as if it had been received on March 31. This assumes
that Pounds 41.3m of the proceeds has been set off against borrowing and the
remaining Pounds 37.3m has been added to cash and bank balances.
Net assets on the pro-forma balance sheet are Pounds 126m, compared with a
reported Pounds 47.3m at March 31 and Pounds 92.9m in 1993.
