FT  05 FEB 92 / Zambia repays World Bank
ZAMBIA, one of the world's most indebted nations, has paid more than Dollars
50m (Pounds 27.6m) of arrears to the World Bank, allowing it to draw fresh
funds from the bank, according to Mr Emmanuel Kasonde, the finance minister,
Reuter reports from Lusaka.
It was able to draw Dollars 71m from a Dollars 80m tranche of a World Bank
loan suspended when the government defaulted on arrears payments last
September, Mr Kasonde said.
The International Monetary Fund and donor nations also suspended aid because
of the default and the failure of former president Kenneth Kaunda's
government to implement reforms agreed with the IMF.
'We are on track and the other donors are coming up with their share of the
1991 obligations. We shall be discussing the 1992 share in coming meetings
in March in Paris,' Mr Kasonde said.
