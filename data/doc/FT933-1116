FT  25 SEP 93 / Scots urged to take the blame
SCOTS WERE urged yesterday by Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish
National party, never to blame the English for what was wrong with Scotland,
James Buxton writes.
He said that if Scots took responsibility for their own circumstances then
'we will be well on our way to self-government'.
In his main address to the party's annual conference at Dunoon, Strathclyde,
Mr Salmond said that Scots had the ability at every general election to
change the face of Scotland.
He said: 'We should be angry at the government for what they are doing to
Scotland. We should be angry at Labour for what they are failing to do. But
let's make sure we never appear to blame the English or anyone else for
Scotland's predicament.'
