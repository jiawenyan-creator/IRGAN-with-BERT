  [Text] Amman, AL-DUSTUR -- A senior Palestinian official 
has denied Israeli media reports that Mahmud 'Abbas, alias 
Abu-Mazin, had approved a draft agreement proposed by Israel on 
the question of the crossings, the area of Jericho, and the 
implementation of the Oslo accord. Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres presented the draft to the Palestinian delegation 
in Cairo last week. 
  The official said the Palestinian delegation told Peres it 
will convey these proposals to the Palestinian leadership to 
adopt an appropriate position. The Palestinian leadership 
rejected most of the proposals. 
  The official added that Israel tries, through its media and 
statements by its officials, to cause confusion among 
Palestinian ranks.
