Africa's Future"] 
  [Excerpts] Netherlands Prime Minister Lubbers expressed his 
confidence in the future of South Africa yesterday. 
  Lubbers described the election of ANC leader Mandela to 
South 
African president as a moving event "at the start of a wonderful 
future." The outgoing prime minister was speaking at a joyful 
reception at the South African Embassy in The Hague. [passage 
omitted] 
  Lubbers said that "the word apartheid has always been an 
open 
wound in the Netherlands. What could we do about it? From the 
left to the moderate right, there was an agreement: We had to 
do something. Now there is joy in our hearts. We belong 
together. We need no longer feel shame because of that word. 
But all is not achieved today. The world must help South 
Africa to maintain peace. For us too, much remains to be done. 
That is my pledge for the future."
