FT  25 SEP 93 / Motoring: Saab ready for take-off
SAAB'S share of executive car sales in Britain, currently a record 6.7 per
cent, seems set to climb with the arrival of the new 900 next month. Pricing
is aggressive; the 140 horsepower 900S 2.0i will cost Pounds 15,995 -
between 7 and 8 per cent less, Saab GB says, than a comparably equipped BMW
318i or Audi 80 2.0E. It should cost no more to insure than a Mondeo 2.0i or
BMW 318i, slightly less than a Cavalier 2.0 SRi or Rover 620 GSi.
Prices of the 155 bhp 900S 2.3i start at Pounds 17,945 and the top model,
the 175 bhp 900SE 2.5V6, with air conditioning and traction control, is
Pounds 21,795. The new cars go on sale on October 20.
