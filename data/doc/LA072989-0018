'PHILOSOPHICAL BAGGAGE' OF EVOLUTION 
According to Christian orthodoxy, faith is a gift given by grace, by God. That 
which can be proven does not require faith, which is the cornerstone of 
Christianity. One is "saved" by grace -- not by the state. 
Fundamentalist Christians indulge in idolatry by demanding that the state 
perform a function which doctrinally belongs only to their God. 
If fundamentalist children have their faith torn down "by talking about 
evolution as fact," their parents should address the problem to their God 
rather than to state curriculum commissions.
