  [Text] A South African newspaper claims that the Israeli 
Mosad was responsible for the murder of Alan Kidger, a local 
businessman, three years ago. The newspaper quotes police 
investigators as saying that Kidger worked for Middle East 
governments and sold them chemicals used to manufacture nuclear 
weapons. Israeli Ambassador in Johannesburg Alon Li'el denied 
the report: 
  [Begin Li'el recording] This morning, we read the details on 
the front pages of the two main papers. After seeing the 
details of the story last night and today and the type of 
charges made, we have denied any Israeli involvement in the 
affair. [end recording]
