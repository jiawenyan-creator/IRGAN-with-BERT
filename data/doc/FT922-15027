Walter Alexander, the Falkirk-based company which is Britain's biggest bus
body manufacturer, has been bought out by its management for Pounds 7.4m.
It was sold by Spotlaunch, a company formed by the finance house Granville
in 1990 to buy Walter Alexander, which was then quoted on the Stock
Exchange.
Spotlaunch took the group private in a Pounds 42m deal and its peripheral
activities were sold off, leaving only the bus manufacturer and Dominick
Hunter, a filtration business.
The buy-out was led by Mr Ian Galloway, chief executive, and is backed by
institutional investors including Standard Life, Dunedin Ventures,
Clydesdale Bank.
