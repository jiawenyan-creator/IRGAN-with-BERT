Crime Swoop"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- A preventive operation code-named 
"Signal 2," in which personnel of the Internal Affairs 
Directorates of Murmansk, Kaliningrad, Pskov, Smolensk, 
Arkhangelsk and other oblasts of Russia and the Republic of 
Karelia took part, has ended in St. Petersburg City and oblast. 
  A simultaneous investigation of all zones and scenes of 
crime 
-- stations, markets, hotels, warehouses, and parking lots -- 
was carried out for the first time. A 500-strong motorized 
infantry regiment of internal troops and a 300-strong motorized 
militia detachment were involved in the operation. Checks and 
controls on railroads and highways leading to Moscow, Pskov, 
Novgorod, and Murmansk were stepped up. People worked 12-hour 
shifts without leave during the operation. 
  The results in brief are that more than 3,500 crimes were 
detected, including 43 murders, around 300 robberies, and more 
than 200 thefts and cases of taking away of vehicles. A huge 
number of firearms and edged weapons, around 40 kg of drugs, and 
money and valuables worth 718 million rubles and $29,000 were 
seized from criminals. The level of crime halved in St 
Petersburg City and oblast during the two weeks of the operation.
