ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; 
MAN SURRENDERS AFTER RIFLE INCIDENT, STANDOFF 
A 48-year-old man who shot a rifle inside a trailer on a construction site 
surrendered to county sheriff's deputies after 3 1/2 hours of negotiations, a 
sheriff's spokesman said Sunday. 
The man, Marciano Sulka, who was described by deputies as "suicidal," was taken 
to Orange County Jail with a request for a psychiatric evaluation, Sgt. Richard 
Burinda said. 
No one was reported injured. The construction site is in the 27000 block of 
Paseo Espada in San Juan Capistrano. 
Sulka was arrested on suspicion of discharging a firearm in a grossly negligent 
manner after his wife and daughter were forced to flee the trailer when he 
fired a rifle about 11 a.m.
