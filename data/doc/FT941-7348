FT  25 FEB 94 / Labour warns on quango abuses
A Labour government would impose financial penalties on members of unelected
public boards which misused taxpayers' money, Mr Michael Meacher, Labour's
Citizen's Charter spokesman, told the Commons last night.
Launching an attack on the growth of unelected state bodies, he said their
number had grown 'dramatically' during the past 15 years.
Mr Meacher condemned the expansion of government patronage and said that the
number of valuable contracts being awarded to companies which made large
contributions to Conservative party funds was more than a coincidence.
His charges were rejected by Mr William Waldegrave, the minister responsible
for the Citizen's Charter, who said there had been a 36 per cent fall in the
number of non-departmental bodies since the Conservatives had returned to
power in 1979.
Appointments to such bodies were made on the basis of qualifications
regardless of party affiliations, he said.
Mr Meacher said a Labour government would transfer a number of the functions
now discharged by quangos - quasi-non-governmental organisations - to
elected authorities.
Members of the remaining quangos would be subject to the same 'surcharge
discipline' that applied to elected members of local authorities, and be
exposed to a tighter system of public supervision.
A Labour motion condemning the rapid growth in expenditure by quangos and
alleging it had been accompanied by 'increased fraud and waste' was defeated
by a government majority of 45 (308-263).
A government amendment noting that the increased powers and independence
given to the comptroller and auditor general had led to more effective
control of fraud and waste was approved by a majority of 61 (306-245).
