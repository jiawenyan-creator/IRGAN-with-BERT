Harold W. Wade, president and chief executive of Childrens Hospital of Orange 
County, is retiring July 31, the hospital said. Wade, 65, has led the pediatric 
facility for the past 15 years. 
During Wade's tenure the hospital in Orange grew into a major pediatric center. 
"The growth of CHOC from nothing to what it is today is the biggest thrill 
anybody could ever have," Wade said of his career. 
During Wade's tenure the hospital nearly doubled its number of licensed beds to 
202 with the 1974 purchase of a five-story building now known as CHOC Tower. 
Wade was also instrumental in the purchase of another facility to house the 
hospital's clinic, administrative and medical education programs. 
CHOC recently began a $50-million program to construct a large hospital to 
replace the outdated tower and consolidate all patient beds in one building. 
Besides helping expand CHOC's real estate holdings, Wade said, he helped 
recruit a full-time staff of about 18 full-time physician specialists at the 
hospital who have introduced new treatment programs for such diseases as cancer 
and diabetes. 
Thomas Penn Jones, currently CHOC's chief financial officer and executive vice 
president, has been named to replace Wade. Jones has headed fiscal services for 
the past 11 years. The hospital says it is currently conducting a search for a 
new chief financial officer.
