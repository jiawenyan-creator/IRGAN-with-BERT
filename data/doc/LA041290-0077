WINE EXHIBIT FUND-RAISER SET 
The California Wine Patrons, still $50,000 short of its goal for funding of the 
Hernando Courtright California Wine Exhibit in Los Angeles, announced it will 
kick off a final fund-raising campaign in May, seeking 50 more wineries as 
supporting members. 
Raoul Balcaen, president of the Patrons, said the initial funding campaign 
raised $800,000, allowing the exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Science and Industry to open last Dec. 4. 
He said letters will be sent to wineries that have not yet joined the exhibit 
as sponsors, seeking support based on the wineries' case production. 
The exhibit covers 2,500 square feet of space in a lower level of the museum. 
It is aimed at educating consumers about the wine industry. 
Included are computer-based interactive exhibits that look at wine making, 
pairing wine with food, wine aromas, and the various microclimates of the state 
and what makes them unique. 
There even is a computer that examines what the body's blood-alcohol level 
would be under various levels of consumption of table wine.
