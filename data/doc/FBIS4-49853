  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- A ceremony was held in 
Beijing today to mark the publication of the Comprehensive 
Chinese Dictionary. 
  Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and other 
leaders Ding Guangen, Li Lanqing and Li Tieying attended the 
ceremony to express congratulations to the editors of the 
dictionary. 
  In 1975, the late Premier Zhou Enlai approved the editing 
and 
publishing of the dictionary. After 18 years of effort, the 12 
volume dictionary was completed in April. 
  The dictionary collects 375,000 entries including about 50 
million Chinese characters and 2,253 illustrations. 
  Jiang Zemin said that the publication of the dictionary is a 
bumper harvest from Chinese cultural, academic, educational and 
publications fields. 
  China has a splendid culture with more than 5,000 years of 
history, he noted, adding that the publication of the dictionary 
represents the developed Chinese culture and will make 
historical contributions to the development of Chinese culture. 
  He said that the academic and publications fields are 
expected to turn out more books and lexicographical works. 
  At the ceremony, Jiang Zemin and Li Peng's inscriptions for 
the dictionary were announced. 
  The dictionary was jointly edited and compiled by 43 units 
including universities, institutes and publishing houses in 
Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian and Shanghai.
