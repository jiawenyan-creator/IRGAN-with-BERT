FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Bespak gloomy after 43% decline to Pounds
2.08m
Bespak, the medical equipment manufacturer, warned yesterday that its
full-year results would be lower than expected following a 43 per cent
decline in interim profits.
In the six months to October 29, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 5.01m to
Pounds 2.88m in spite of increased turnover of Pounds 31m (Pounds 27.4m).
The company said the decline, which prompted a profits warning last month,
mainly reflected lower sales in the US where uncertainty over the impact of
President Clinton's health reforms persuaded many Bespak customers to reduce
stocks.
In dollar terms, first half turnover in the US - representing 46 per cent of
the group total - fell by 14 per cent. Sales to US Surgical, Bespak's
largest North American customer, fell by 34 per cent.
The poor performance in the US and continental Europe, where turnover
declined 7 per cent to Pounds 3.05m, pushed operating profits down by 39 per
cent to Pounds 2.93m (Pounds 4.83m).
The share price, however, climbed 12p yesterday to 320p after the company
said a healthy balance sheet and relatively low gearing of 15 per cent
enabled it to increase the interim dividend by 5 per cent to 4.2p (4p).
Mr Alun Hicks, finance director, said the higher dividend reflected the
board's confidence about future performance.
That optimism was based on improving turnover in the UK, where sales of
medical valves and components increased from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 12.1m.
Most of the increase came from a Pounds 1.5m contribution from Medix Group,
the breathing equipment manufacturer which Bespak acquired in May for Pounds
1.8m.
The company said it had written off Pounds 439,000 in goodwill on the
acquisition.
Earnings per share amounted to 7.5p (13.2p).
