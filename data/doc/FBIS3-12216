  [Text] United Nations, February 25 (AFP)--UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali sharply condemned the Hebron 
massacre of 53 Palestinians Friday and called on Israel to 
prevent Jewish settlers from committing other criminal acts. 
  Butrus-Ghali, in an official statement released here in New 
York, expressed deep concern over the attack in the West Bank 
town of Hebron and the effect it might have on the Middle East 
peace process. 
  He called for calm by all sides in the negotiations and the 
immediate implementation of the Declaration of Principles for 
Palestinian autonomy hammered out in Middle East peace talks. 
  Earlier, Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) 
representative Nasir al-Qidwah said the Security Council will 
likely call an emergency meeting Friday on the Hebron massacre. 
  Asked whether the council would meet on Friday, al-Qidwah 
said, "yes, probably in the afternoon. I guess we will have it." 
  Asked what outcome he hoped to get from the meeting, he said 
"I prefer not to get into that at this stage." 
  The call for the emergency Security Council session came 
hours after one or more Jewish settlers shot dead 53 
Palestinians and wounded 80 during dawn prayers at a Hebron 
mosque in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
