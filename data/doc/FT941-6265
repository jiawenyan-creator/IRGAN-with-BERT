FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bank Austria bids for GiroCredit
Bank Austria, Austria's largest bank, is bidding for control of GiroCredit,
the savings banks' clearing institution and a leading commercial bank in its
own right.
The object of the move - equivalent to an unfriendly takeover bid - is to
force a restructuring of the savings bank sector.
The bid is being made through Anteilsverwaltung Zentralsparkasse, BA's
biggest shareholder and holding company of the former Zentralsparkasse, the
Vienna city savings bank now merged into BA, which is offering to buy
GiroCredit shares from savings banks across the country.
It is offering a mixture of Sch370 cash per nominal Sch100 GiroCredit share
and/or the equivalent of Sch400 per Sch100 nominal GiroCredit shares in BA
bearer stock.
The offer expires on 18 March.
Bank Austria owns just under 31 per cent in GiroCredit. It aims to buy at
least another 20.4 per cent of GiroCredit's shares to raise its shareholding
to above 50 per cent.
BA's announcement came as a surprise, and it follows several earlier
unsuccessful attempts to restructure GiroCredit and the savings banks
sector.
Leading savings banks from Salzburg, Linz and Graz responded cautiously to
the bid, saying they would have to look at the offer in detail and compare
it to an earlier plan put forward by BA for a restructuring of the savings
banks.
This entailed selling about two-thirds of BA's holding in GiroCredit to a
consortium comprising the Erste Oesterreichische Spar-Casse, the second
largest savings bank, Austria Collegialitat Versicherung, a leading
insurance company, and the savings banks.
Erste which already owned about 21 per cent of GiroCredit was to buy a
further 10 per cent. But this plan - which had a February deadline - was
abandoned following disagreements over price.
All the savings banks including the Erste Spar-Casse which refused the
original plan, are due to meet today to discuss their response to the
takeover bid from BA.
Union Bank of Switzerland is making an agreed takeover bid for Regiobank
Beider Basel (Regio Bank), a northern Swiss regional bank, Reuter reports
from Zurich.
Regio has a balance sheet of SFr2.5bn (Dollars 1.7m) and about 200
employees.
