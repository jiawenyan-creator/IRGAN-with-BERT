FT  22 FEB 92 / Milestone for Shanghai exchange
THE attractions of the Shanghai Vacuum Electron Device Company may not be
readily apparent from its name, but the company opened a new chapter in
China's financial history yesterday when shares owned by foreigners began
trading on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
For the first time since the communists took power in 1949, foreigners have
been permitted to trade freely in a publicly quoted Chinese asset. The
company is also the first Chinese state-owned company to admit foreign
owners.
If Shanghai Vacuum's first day of trading is anything to go by, China's
fledgling experiment with elements of capitalism, known as 'socialism with
Chinese characteristics', got off to a good start. The company's share price
rose 26 per cent from its issue price of Dollars 70 to close at Dollars
88.50, on turnover of 3,430 shares.
Shanghai Vacuum makes TV tubes (both black and white, and colour) and
electron guns. It is the pride of Shanghai and, by virtue of city government
regulation, has a virtual monopoly for what it makes.
Three weeks ago, a group of foreign merchant banks, led by SBCI Asia
Finance, placed 1m 'B' shares in the company with international investors.
The placement, four times oversubscribed, raised Dollars 78m to fund higher
output of colour TV tubes.
The shares were due to start trading on Thursday but the Shanghai
authorities asked for a day's delay because February 20 was not deemed
auspicious.
