FT  18 SEP 93 / Tokyo prepared for 'pain' on jobs and restructuring
JAPAN'S new government is bracing itself for a rise in unemployment as
structural changes in the country's economy lead to drastic corporate
restructuring and redundancies.
Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, yesterday
warned that lay-offs and corporate restructuring were inevitable, and that
Japan would undergo 'painful times' for which there was 'no quick panacea'.
So far, Japanese companies have coped with the downturn in the economy by
cutting labour costs through staff relocation, lending employment to other
companies, and temporary lay-offs. The country's bureaucrats have denied the
possibility of wide-spread redundancies because companies fear a labour
shortage when the economy recovers.
Unemployment has been contained at 2.5 per cent. However, companies face
high levels of 'in-house unemployment', bearing the overhead burden for
staff who have nothing to do. 'Real unemployment would be substantially
higher than 2.5 per cent if such staff were considered,' said Mr Kumagai.
Large companies are now starting to drop such employees. Last month, Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone, the telecom company, announced it would cut about
10,000 employees through voluntary retirement by the end of next year.
Nippon Steel, the world's largest steel-maker, said it was about to reduce
the number of administrative staff in its steel division.
William Dawkins adds: Further evidence of Japanese consumers' cautious mood
emerged yesterday, with Tokyo department stores reporting falling sales in
August for the 18th month in a row.
Last month's sales fell by 6.6 per cent from those of August 1992, said the
Japan Department Stores Association. It attributed the decline to an
unusually wet summer which, combined with the yen's continued rise, has
pulled Japan close to recession.
