MALL BUILDER PAYS DEPOSIT OF $1 MILLION TO BURBANK 
The Burbank City Council, acting as the city's Redevelopment Agency, has 
formally agreed to negotiate exclusively with developer Alexander Haagen to 
build a downtown shopping mall that could cost as much as $200 million. 
As part of the agreement, Haagen, a major developer of malls in Southern 
California, paid a "good-faith" deposit of $1 million to the city. The deposit 
will be applied toward the purchase price or lease payment for the proposed 
shopping center site. 
Haagen is also giving the city an additional $500,000 to pay the city's costs 
in negotiating an agreement and preparing environmental studies on the project. 
The agreement, announced Tuesday, marks the latest step in Burbank's plan to 
have a major shopping mall within the city limits. The city has tried 
unsuccessfully to develop a mall on 41 acres near the Civic Center, but 
projects proposed by several developers have fallen through. 
Haagen has proposed building the Burbank Gateway Center, a 1.4 
million-square-foot project to include a two-level mall, offices, hotels and 
restaurants. The shopping center will be anchored by the Ikea furniture store, 
as well as Buffums, Mervyn's and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. department stores. 
The site is at Magnolia and Burbank boulevards near the Golden State Freeway. 
Community Development officials said the city will negotiate details of the 
proposal, including how much the project will cost, in the next 30 to 90 days. 
If the council approves the concept and details, an environmental review of the 
project will be conducted. After that, a final plan would be brought before the 
council.
