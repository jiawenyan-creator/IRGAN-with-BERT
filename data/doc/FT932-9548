FT  13 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Currencies
It is curious how little attention the currency markets paid yesterday to
the jump in US producer prices. Perhaps one reason is that the dollar has
already risen more than three pfennigs over the past week. Another is that
the figures were distorted by higher tobacco prices. But the over-riding
factor is continuing uncertainty over the degree to which the recovery is
accelerating again after the disappointing first quarter. Last week's
employment data failed to provide conclusive evidence one way or another.
Today's retail sales data may prove a better pointer. Reasonably strong
figures would imply a boost for industrial production later in the quarter
as inventories are rebuilt.
Until confidence in the recovery returns, though, the dollar's scope for
appreciation will remain limited, which gives the Bundesbank more room for
manoeuvre. That is just as well when German bond markets face heavy supply
of public sector paper and Mr Theo Waigel's future as finance minister is
uncertain. Yesterday's reduction in the Bundesbank's money market repurchase
rate makes a cut in the official discount rate - now a mere 35 basis points
below money market rates - more likely next week. Whatever happens in the
Danish Maastricht referendum, the bank will at least be able to say it did
its bit for Europe.
