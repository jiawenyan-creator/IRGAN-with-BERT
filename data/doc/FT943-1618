FT  23 SEP 94 / Car output shows 6% increase
UK car production was 70,633 last month, 6 per cent higher than the figure
of 66,653 in the same month last year, confirming the rising trend of output
in the past three months.
In the first eight months of this year car production has risen by 2.3 per
cent to 949,450 - helped by higher output for export markets.
UK car production was 'becalmed' at about 1.375m a year between September
1993 and May 1994, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, with lower output for export offset by higher production for the
domestic market.
Yet in recent months output for export markets has been growing consistently
 -by 4.3 per cent year-on-year in the first eight months to 362,309 and by 7
per cent in August to 28,524.
Export growth has come from Rover - in particular its Land Rover
four-wheel-drive vehicle division - Jaguar, Honda and Toyota. This helped to
offset declines at Ford, Vauxhall and Peugeot and a sharp fall in production
at Nissan.
The SMMT has forecast significant growth in production in the second half of
the year, in particular in response to a demand recovery in continental
European new-car markets.
Production of commercial vehicles in August more than doubled to 12,040 from
5,506 in the corresponding month a year ago, when output was very depressed
with a decline of 56 per cent.
