  [Text] The UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola] movement of Angola has accused the Angolan Government 
of carrying out fresh attacks and said such action is 
compromising the Angolan peace talks taking place in the Zambian 
capital, Lusaka. 
  UNITA's information secretary, Mr. Jorge Valentin, said the 
atmosphere at the United Nations, the mediator of talks which 
began in November, had been positive so far, but said government 
actions were creating mistrust and pessimism among negotiators. 
Mr. Valentin said the peace talks which had led to agreements 
in principle on various military and legal matters would be 
interrupted if the international community did not speak out 
against an increase in government military action.
