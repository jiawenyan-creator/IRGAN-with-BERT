<F P=106> [Article signed KVB: "Kok Feels That There Is `Pretty Good' </F>
Chance for Serious Assessment of Purple Coalition"] 
  [Text] The Hague, 10 May (ANP) -- PvdA [Labor Party] leader 
Wim Kok feels that there is a "pretty good" chance that work can 
begin next week on a serious assessment of a "purple" coalition 
(without the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal]). Kok said this 
Tuesday [10 May] following talks with Tjeenk Willink, who is 
assessing on behalf of the crown which government coalition is 
possible. 
  According to Kok, "logically priority must be given to the 
`purple' coalition." He felt that this kind of cooperation 
between the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], the 
PvdA, and the D66 [Democrats 66] must be "seriously tried out in 
all its possibilities." 
  Kok's statements were notable because on Monday he expressed 
major reservations about a "purple" coalition. According to 
some members of the group, a large current within the PvdA would 
prefer to cooperate with the VVD rather than undertake a 
secondary coalition with the CDA, whereas Kok is said to have 
serious doubts. Others deny, however, that there is talk of 
opposition between the floor leader and some of his rank and 
file regarding a "purple" coalition. 
  In the meantime, finance specialist Melkert has begun 
putting 
together a "formation report" listing the possible bottlenecks 
that could arise in the government formation talks and the 
PvdA's stake in the negotiations. According to Melkert, the 
document is not specifically aimed at talks to form a "purple" 
coalition. 
  The biggest differences between the PvdA and the three other 
large parties can be found in the area of social security and 
the reorganization of government spending. The VVD wants all 
new benefits to be lowered to 60 percent of the minimum wage. 
The CDA wants to put a freeze on benefits for four years. The 
PvdA, however, wants to link them to wages in the market sector 
as much as possible.
