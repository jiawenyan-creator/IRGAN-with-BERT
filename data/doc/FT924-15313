FT  05 OCT 92 / Tory disputes over economy are aired
DISAGREEMENTS among senior Conservatives about the harsh medicine needed to
survive the present economic turmoil surfaced yesterday. Lord Parkinson, who
served in the Thatcher cabinet, said the priority should be to restrain
interest rates rather than taxes to protect capital spending programmes.
'The last thing our economy needs at the moment is higher interest rates,'
he said on BBC radio. 'As part of getting interest rates down, giving the
economy a boost and maintaining the capital programmes in the public
expenditure programme, I would be prepared to see a levy of some kind that
would put up taxes.'
He spoke as senior ministers strove to dispel fears of tax increases. They
emphasised that control of public spending was even more important than
before for the government's anti-inflationary strategy.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, emphasised the need to bring stability
back to the pound's exchange rates.
Mr Clarke, who was joined in his efforts to calm money market nervousness
about economic policy by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
added that the aim was to get public expenditure under control so there
would be no need for tax increases.
