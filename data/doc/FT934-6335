FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Goodhead falls Pounds 17m into red
Goodhead Group, the printing and publishing company, yesterday announced a
Pounds 17m pre-tax loss for the year to end-May, a Pounds 5.8m placing and
open offer, and two disposals.
The deficit compared with a profit of Pounds 335,000 last time and included
a Pounds 10.3m adjustment for goodwill, a Pounds 4.34m net loss on the
disposal or closure of subsidiaries and Pounds 2.26m of other asset
write-downs.
Turnover fell from Pounds 40.3m to Pounds 37.4m, of which Pounds 7.77m
(Pounds 9.85m) was attributed to discontinued operations.
Losses per share came out at 101.4p (1.9p) and the single dividend is cut
from 0.5p to 0.05p.
Mr John Madejski, chairman and chief executive, said that the net assets of
the group had fallen substantially - from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 6.81m. The
purpose of the proposed fund-raising was to address that reduc-tion and cut
borrowings, he said.
The company is proposing to raise Pounds 5.8m net of expenses via a placing
and open offer of 24.2m new ordinary shares at 25p apiece on a 9-for-7 basis
and/or 1.8368 new ordinary for every two preference shares held.
Mr Madejski is to subscribe up to Pounds 5.5m. A further 2m shares are to
placed with 3i, subject to the entitlements of shareholders. Dealings in the
new shares are expected to commence on December 22.
The fund-raising is subject to shareholder approval. In particular, they are
being asked to approve the waive by the Takeover Panel of the possible
obligation on the chairman to make a general offer for Goodhead in the event
of his holding carrying more than 30 per cent of the voting rights in the
company.
In addition, in line with Goodhead's objective of refocusing the business,
it is proposed that all non-core activities are sold.
A number of disposals had already been completed, the chairman said, and the
company is now seeking shareholder approval for the sale of the leasehold
property at Portbury, Bristol, and for the sale to its management of Company
Publicity and its subsidiaries.
The shares closed up 6p at 23p.
