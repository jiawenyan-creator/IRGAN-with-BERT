FT  22 AUG 92 / Markets (At A Glance): No-cost Pep from TR
Touche Remnant is offering a personal equity plan investing in the TR
Smaller Companies Investment Trust, which is free of any charges to the
investor. There will not even be any charge for dealing or stamp duty.
However, Touche Remnant will receive an administration fee from TR Smaller
Companies. TR believes that this will be in the interests of shareholders
because any reduction in the trust's net asset value will be outweighed by a
reduction in the discount. The trust has not been particularly attractive
for Pep investors so far because it aims for capital growth rather than
income, but TR does not believe this will be an issue when there are no
direct charges to investors.
Meanwhile, smaller company shares in general continue to fall. The Hoare
Govett Smaller Companies Index (capital gains version) fell 0.2 per cent
from 1027.7 to 1026.05 in the seven days to August 20, while the County
Index fell 0.5 per cent to 815.69 over the same period.
