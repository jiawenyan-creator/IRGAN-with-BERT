  [Text] Crimea's Central Electoral Commission has passed a 
resolution on providing support for a poll to be held among the 
peninsula's population, set by Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov 
to take place on 27 March. The commission reports this 
resolution was the result of a compromise between the Central 
Electoral Commission and the autonomy's head of executive power. 
The required changes and amendments to his directive had been 
made by the president, which in commission members' view will 
ensure differences between the directive and the legislation are 
settled. 
  The Central Electoral Commission agreed organizationally to 
help carry out a poll among those wishing to do this. It will 
not, however, take part in determining its results. This 
function is to be performed by officials authorized by the 
Crimean president.
