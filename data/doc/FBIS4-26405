  [Text] Beijing, June 21 (CNS) -- According to the China 
Coal Industrial Import and Export Corporation, China will 
strengthen its construction of railways and ports in order to 
increase its coal export, and by the year of 2,000, the volume 
of such export will increase to 30 million tonnes. 
  Relevant experts at a conference on coal production recently 
held in Australia predicted that China would become an important 
country for coal export in the world. With the rapid 
development of coal industry, China would in the near future 
provoke a threat to Australia's status as the biggest coal 
export country in the world. 
  In 1992, China exported 20.2 million tonne coal to more than 
20 countries and regions and its coal markets overseas were 
mainly in Asia and Europe. But this year such an export is 
predicted to be 22 million tonnes. 
  China now is still practicing a monopolized policy on the 
management of this special commodity and only some specialized 
companies designated by the state are allowed to engage in 
coal's sales. 
  At present, coal export from China has made up two percent 
of 
its total output and accounted for about five percent of the 
total coal trade in the world market.
