FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: BASF warns of large-scale
lay-offs
BASF, the German chemicals group, yesterday announced a slow start to
profits for this year and warned of large-scale lay-offs.
Group sales have risen by about 2 per cent to DM7.7bn (Dollars 4.66bn) in
the first two months of the year - but earnings in that period have not come
up to the same level as last year.
Mr Jurgen Strube, chief executive, disclosed this at a press conference at
the company's headquarters in Ludwigshafen yesterday.
He predicted that sales for the whole of the current year would probably
rise by more than 2 per cent - but refused to be drawn on the likely outlook
for profit, or whether he thought the worst was over for the blighted
industrial chemicals industry.
'Indications of a quick recovery are nowhere in the offing,' Mr Strube said,
describing 1991 as a year of disappointment for the company.
As announced last week, pre-tax profits dropped by 23 per cent to DM2.18bn
on stagnant sales of DM46.6bn and the company has decided to cut its
dividend for 1991 by DM1 to DM12 per share.
BASF said it would be exploiting 'all opportunities for optimisation and
cost cuts' and that jobs in the group were likely to shrink by around 9,500
to about 120,000 during the current year through early retirement and
attrition. Capital investment was DM4.8bn last year and is likely to be at
the same level in the current year.
At present, earnings remain unsatisfactory and incoming orders show no sign
of bucking the trend, the chief executive said yesterday.
'Persistently declining selling prices were not offset by a corresponding
drop in prices for raw materials and as a result, margins shrunk,' Mr Strube
said about the first two months' trading. 'We were unable to cushion the
decline in contribution margins as we were not successful in cutting fixed
costs as planned.'
