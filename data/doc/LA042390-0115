LOCAL; 
WIFE-BEATING SUSPECT KILLS SELF 
A man suspected of beating his wife held deputies at bay in Orange for nearly 
two hours before he walked out of his home, yelled out his wife's name, put a 
gun to his head and killed himself, authorities said today. 
Ronald Phillips, 57, died of a single gunshot to the head at the front door of 
his home in the 9300 block of Batavia Street, Lt. Richard Olson said. 
The incident began about 8:45 p.m. Sunday when Phillips' wife, whose name was 
not released, fled the home, called deputies and reported that her husband had 
beaten her, Lt. Larry Richey said. 
"We went to the house with the knowledge that he had been drinking and had a 
gun in his possession," Richey said. 
Deputies telephoned the man and told him to come out of the house and 
surrender, but he refused, Richey said. 
"Then, about 10:21 p.m., he came the front door, yelled his wife's name and put 
the handgun to his head and fired one shot, killing himself," Richey said.
