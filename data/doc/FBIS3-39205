France's Foreign Policy'"] 
  [Text] RPR [Rally for the Republic] defense policy expert 
Pierre Lellouche said that following NATO's ultimatum against 
the Serbs, "for the first time, there is a glimmer of hope" in 
former Yugoslavia; he condemned "kouchnerism, which dug the 
grave of foreign policy." 
  "We hid behind a veil of media-inspired excuses, posturing, 
and well-meaning generalities in order to avoid having to do 
anything, to try to influence the course of events at an earlier 
time," he stated during a radio program jointly sponsored by LA 
CROIX [Catholic daily]. "Kouchnerism -- that is, a humanitarian 
policy that sends soldiers to the field without providing them 
with a political goal nor military means -- acted as a grave 
digger for the foreign and defense policies of large democratic 
nations," added the Val-d'Oise representative, who stated that 
"this policy led us down a cul-de-sac, delayed decisive events, 
and in effect sanctioned the territorial status-quo." 
  To the question "must Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 
be 
brought down?," Pierre Lellouche answers: "Of course, Milosevic 
must be brought down." "National-Communism and the dictators" 
which rule former Communist countries "will spell disaster for 
the world," he adds. On the subject of NATO's ultimatum, 
Jacques Chirac's diplomatic advisor says he is "very proud of 
the work done by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and the 
government. In the three years that this horror has been going 
on (in former Yugoslavia), this is the first time that we get 
out of the quagmire where we have lost our honor," he concluded. 
"For the first time, there is a glimmer of hope."
