FT  11 JUN 94 / Deregulation has 'failed' Britain
Labour will next week launch a strong attack on the 'appalling failure' of
the government's policy of deregulation, saying that it has had 'enormous
social repercussions' in unemployment, poverty and crime.
The party will use its 29-page response to the European Commission's green
paper on social policy to call for new voluntary one-year work programmes
for the long-term unemployed and to underline its support for a statutory
minimum wage.
This would be set at 'a fair rate . . . in compensation for the work
undertaken'.
On deregulation, Labour will claim that the government's policies have
resulted in:
The worst GDP growth among the G7 nations between 1979 and 1993.
The highest unit labour costs in the tradeable sector.
The lowest skill level among the G7.
It will dismiss as 'facile' the argument that Britain must force down wages
and benefits if it is to compete with Asian 'tigers' such as Thailand and
Korea. 'Society will not tolerate the misery and unrest which would have to
accompany this route.'
Acknowledging that it is crucial to 'enable wealth creators to provide
employment', the paper will argue that governments 'cannot avoid their
responsibilities to intervene when free markets fail'.
Drawn up by a team under Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, the
document will call for new temporary work programmes after discussions with
employers and others to minimise job substitution and 'dead-weight effects'.
There should be 'no compulsions' to participate in such programmes, while
participants should be paid under a 'rate-for-the-job formula'.
The paper commits Labour to adopting the social chapter and preparing a UK
bill of rights.
