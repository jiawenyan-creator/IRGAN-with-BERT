  [Text] Hong Kong, December 30 (XINHUA) -- The possibility 
of reopening the Sino-British negotiations on the 1994-95 
electoral arrangements in Hong Kong can only be considered if 
the British side withdraws the political reform scheme made by 
Governor Chris Patten. 
  This was stated by Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the 
local branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, after attending the 1994 
New Year reception held by the China Areospace International 
Holdings Ltd. here today. 
  China will watch closely whether the British side wanted to 
depart from its stubborn position, Zhang added. 
  He used a Chinese saying "he who created trouble has to 
solve 
it" to make the point that it is up to the British side, which 
broke off the negotiations on Hong Kong's future, to strive for 
the restarting of the process. 
  Replying to a question about Patten's comments on the 
dissolution of Hong Kong's three-tier councils, namely the 
Legislative Council, district boards and two municipal councils 
set up under the British rule, after the change-over of power in 
1997, Zhang said "it is an internal matter of our country. It 
is only absurd that he (Patten) should have something to say on 
it."
