FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: CMG rises 54% to Pounds 6.8m
Computer Management Group, one of Europe's largest privately-held computing
services companies, pushed pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 6.8m
at the halfway stage, an improvement of 54 per cent.
Turnover grew 13 per cent from Pounds 61.5m to Pounds 69.7m, while fully
diluted earnings per share rose 59 per cent to 25.3p (15.9p). Operating
margins improved to 9.5 per cent (6.8 per cent) and turnover per employee in
the first six months grew to over Pounds 37,790.
CMG, with staff numbering over 2000, operates principally in the UK and
continental Europe. It is likely to seek a London listing in the spring of
next year, subject to market conditions.
Mr Douglas Gorman, chairman, said the improved results reflected a
continuing demand for computing services throughout Europe.
'The Netherlands continues to be our largest market with 63 per cent of
turnover and is growing strongly'. The company is strong in mobile
telecommunications with projects in Russia, Poland, Germany and Portugal.
Mr Gorman said that trading conditions were improving in the UK, while
banking and consultancy services were developing well in Germany.
