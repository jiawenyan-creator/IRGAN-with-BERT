FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: SAS stays in red with SKr1.2bn
deficit
SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of
SKr1.2bn (Dollars 198m) for 1991, the second straight year it has suffered a
deficit following its loss of SKr763m in 1990.
The loss reflected extraordinary costs associated with a restructuring
programme as well as a write-off of its involvement in the Inter-Continental
hotel chain. SAS made a small operating loss of SKr9m before extraordinary
costs against a profit of SKr38m in 1990.
But Mr Jan Carlzon, SAS president, expressed confidence that SAS could
return to profitability this year if it succeeds with its cost-cutting
programme, which includes eliminating 3,500 jobs by this summer.
The carrier confirmed it had reached a preliminary agreement to sell back
its 40 per cent stake in Inter-Continental to the hotel chain's controlling
shareholder, Saison Holding, part of the Japanese retail and leisure group.
Mr Carlzon said the airline has lost between SKr1.5bn and SKr2bn from its
unsuccessful attempt to expand its hotel operations after it purchased the
stake in Inter-Continental from Saison in 1989 for Dollars 500m.
The hotel venture was part of Mr Carlzon's strategy during the 1980s to
transform SAS into a complete travel company. But the SAS president decided
last year to concentrate on airline operations as passenger traffic dropped
in response to the Gulf War and the recession.
However, SAS will acquire principal ownership of three European hotels from
Inter-Continental, including the Portman in London, the Dusseldorf
Inter-Continental and Cologne Inter-Continental, which will be added to
SAS's own hotel chain.
The write-off of its shares in Inter-Continental as well as the bankrupt US
carrier Continental Airlines amounted to SKr1.2bn, which helped increase
one-time restructuring and extraordinary expenses for SAS to SKr1.9bn.
