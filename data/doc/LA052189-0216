TIPS FOR A SUCCESSFUL HOME OFFICE 
* Find a separate room for the office. 
* Set definite work hours. 
* Arrange for child care for children under 5. 
* Get "dressed" for work. A bathrobe over your PJs doesn't count! 
* Have a separate business telephone and use either an answering machine or 
answering service for after-hours calls. 
* Keep your contacts with colleagues and co-workers alive and current. 
* Get out of the house at least once a day. 
* Treat household interruptions as though you were at the office. In other 
words, they do not exist. 
* Learn how to tell your family -- firmly but nicely -- that you are working 
and do not want to be interrupted. 
* Make sure you have a door on your office space and be sure to close it when 
you have finished working.
