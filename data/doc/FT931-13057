FT  26 JAN 93 / Letter: Local programmes offer potential for building
ex-Soviet markets
Sir, Edward Balls' report (''Bottom-up' style in fashion for ex-Soviet
reform', January 18), suggesting that reform efforts be focused upon
ex-Soviet regions where local governments are more progressive, has
parallels with conclusions resulting from our detailed studies of western
joint venture investment in the USSR and FSU (former Soviet Union).
For the past two years, in conjunction with the American Soviet Exchange
Centre for Applied Theory and Practice at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh,
we have tracked the performance and expectations of 623 ventures. These
investments involve American, Austrian, British, French, German, Italian,
Spanish, Turkish and multinational western European participation in the
Soviet and FSU markets since February 1991.
While fewer than than 18 per cent (112) of the ventures are expected to be
profitable in the short term, almost 65 per cent of those (72) are what we
term 'Limited Local Entry Joint Ventures'.
These projects have emphasised co-operation with local/autonomous
region/republic governments prepared to support local reforms; and have
expedited protocol supports, favourable currency terms, and support with
equivalent industrial site directors and labour representatives.
Such ventures have also identified existing domestic participants in the
local markets to be served, and have minimised initial capital commitment
requirements. They have also been able to secure adequate fiduciary and
banking support because of the focused plans for entry.
There is clearly emerging sufficient evidence to indicate that combining
local government reforms with small-scale western investment programmes
intent on targeting such progressive markets may well initiate both a
positive return on funds committed and a model for broader Russian,
Ukrainian, Kazakh and Baltic market reforms 'from the bottom up'.
