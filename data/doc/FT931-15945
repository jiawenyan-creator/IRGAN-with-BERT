FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Policyholders wait anxiously for
pay-outs - As the 'bonus season' begins, John Authers answers your questions
on mortgage endowments
AT THIS moment, a bunch of actuaries could be deciding the value of the
investment which will pay off your mortgage.
The annual 'bonus season', when extra bonuses are added on to the value of
life assurance policies under the arcane 'with-profits' system has now
started (see box on right). The exact amount to be passed on to
policyholders is at the discretion of the actuary.
And, as the table shows, the trend for pay-outs is downwards. This might
seem odd at first, as both bonds and equities, in which life funds are
mostly invested, performed strongly last year.
Unfortunately, investment performance is only one of several factors
actuaries must consider when paying out maturity values. And the legacies of
the past, combined with a future outlook which could bring lower returns and
lower inflation, have in many cases more than cancelled out the funds'
recent gains.
Policyholders will now have many questions:
Why have pay-outs dropped?
The market fell in 1990. Actuaries assumed this was a blip and did not cut
bonuses. The subsequent recovery has not been strong enough to cancel out
1990, so pay-outs have to come down even though markets have gone up.
Other factors are in play. Returns are expected to be lower in future, and
so the companies need to reduce reversionary bonus. Once these have been
announced they are committed to them, so they are not going to announce a
rate which they cannot sustain.
Then, actuaries must look at their volume of business. It is easy to
announce a high maturity value if only a few policies are maturing in the
next year. But when a large volume of policies is about to mature, the music
stops - a generous pay-out will cost serious money.
This lies behind Sun Alliance's particularly savage 15 per cent cut in
10-year pay-outs. A cut of this magnitude after a good year seems almost
impossible to justify on logical grounds, but Sun Alliance wrote a lot of
10-year business 10 years ago. Those who bought one of their policies in
1983 must be wishing they had bought a year earlier.
Are with-profits endowments a good investment?
This is the tricky one. As pay-outs have been artificially high for the past
few years, they are of no use in predicting future returns.
But pay-outs, after the latest drastic round of pruning, must be closer to
reality than they were and investors in most companies can have few
complaints. The annualised return from Commercial Union is 13.2 per cent
over 10 years and 13.3 per cent over 25 years. The equivalent figures for
Norwich Union are 13.0 per cent and 12.9 per cent, while Sun Alliance showed
yields of 9.9 per cent and 11.9 per cent.
These figures are comfortably in excess of inflation, which averaged 9.1 per
cent over the past 25 years and 5.5 per cent over 10 years. Norwich Union
points out that as recently as 1985, 10-year policies were yielding less
than inflation. Offices still predict that real returns will be maintained.
The question of whether they are the best available long-term investment now
hinges on the circumstances of the investor. The policies are not as
tax-efficient as other long-term vehicles - most obviously personal equity
plans and pensions - and they are very inflexible. If you surrender early,
you will not receive the full value of what your money has earned.
High commissions to intermediaries and the expense of life assurance, which
many people do not need when they are making an investment, make it an
expensive way to invest. Too many people surrender their policies,
indicating that a 25 year inflexible policy is not the best product to be
selling to the mass market.
But for those who can take the commitment, returns are still satisfactory.
Will they succeed in repaying the mortgage?
Several commentators have suggested that they may not. Much of this is
premature.
When premiums are quoted for a mortgage endowment, the standard practice is
to assume that no terminal bonus will be paid, while reversionary bonus will
continue throughout the term of the policy at only 80 per cent of its level
at the start. Terminal bonus often makes up more than half of the final
pay-out on a 25-year policy, so this is very conservative. At present,
maturing endowments provide investors with massive profits compared with the
amount they borrowed.
However, Guardian Royal Exchange's decision not to pay any terminal bonus at
all on its 10-year policy this year, the first time it has failed to do so
since 1968, will not bolster confidence in this area.
For unitised with-profits contracts, a straight growth rate is assumed,
currently around 8.5 per cent, before charges. That does not appear onerous.
But if inflation and returns stay low, 8.5 per cent might be a problem. For
Norwich Union, annual nominal growth of 8.25 per cent is needed to repay a
mortgage in full 25 years from now. Those who took out policies in 1988 or
1990 now need the fund to achieve 10 per cent annual growth for the rest of
its term for the mortgage to be paid off in full.
About a decade will pass before anyone can tell whether this is too
optimistic. A spokesman for NU said the 'vast majority' of policyholders
should be able to meet capital repayment, and it would be many years before
it became clear whether those who took their policies out a few years ago
would have difficulties.
Anyone whose endowment is more than half way through its term has little to
worry about. The high reversionary bonuses slapped on during the 1980s leave
the fund with little left to do to meet requirements.
Marianne Cantley of Scottish Provident calculated this by working out the
annual reversionary bonuses which would need to be added to policies over
the rest of their term for them to meet their target. If you took out a
policy last year, you will need average annual bonuses of 4.55 per cent.
This figure drops to 4.49 for policies started in 1990, and 4.42 for 1988.
However, those who started in time to catch the genuine growth of the early
1980s, have little to worry about. Any policy taken out in 1974 or earlier
has already reached its target, according to Cantley, and need not pay any
more bonuses at all. Policies started in 1976 need 0.22 per cent annual
bonuses, and those in 1978 need 1.52 per cent.
If policies are likely to undershoot, this should become clear some years
before maturity, and the industry has pledged to monitor policies and advise
customers when they need to raise their premiums. Unitised with-profits has
made this easier for offices to administer.
But no rule states all your mortgage saving should be with one life company.
Those who took out their endowments in 1988 or 1989, and can afford to save
more, might supplement the policy with savings into a unit or investment
trust. If done through a Pep this will be more tax-efficient than an
endowment.
But a final point, provided by John Hyland of Standard Life, should reassure
those who fear endowments' problems could spell financial ruin. If
endowments fail to meet their target, this will presumably be because
inflation and returns have been low. These conditions usually correlate with
low mortgage interest rates. If endowments look as though they will not do
their job, your interest payments will be less, giving you more money to
make supplementary savings.
Correction. A bar chart covering policy payouts over 10 years which appeared
in yesterday's FT, used figures based on premiums of Pounds 30 per month,
not Pounds 50 per month as stated. The correct figures are shown in the
table.
