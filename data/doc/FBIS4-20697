<H5>  1. Current State of Database Maintenance at JAERI </H5>
  JAERI stores the results of its research in various 
databases. A report of a study carried out in March 1989 
revealed that JAERI maintained roughly 80 such databases. The 
information contained in these databases ranges from that on 
basic research fields to safety research and large-scale 
projects on nuclear fusion. 
  However, most of these databases are used to store 
memorandums on in-house research, to collect data required to 
advance in-house research efforts and/or to serve as records of 
operational activities. Very few of these databases were created 
with the purpose in mind of allowing outsiders to access and use 
the results of JAERI's research. 
  This situation has created discontent among those outside 
JAERI who find it difficult to use the results of JAERI 
research, and this in turn raised the specter of declining 
evaluations of JAERI as a research institute. Therefore, in 
1988, JAERI set up a working group inside its Computing Center, 
and for the next two years this group studied the current state 
of database maintenance at JAERI, database requirements both 
inside and outside of JAERI, and those databases that should be 
upgraded to make them accessible to outside researchers as well 
as the system for accomplishing this. 
  This working group established conditions on which JAERI 
could base decisions for upgrading its databases. These 
conditions are: 
  (1) data available only to JAERI (Originality); 
  (2) data clearly collated via the research capabilities of 
JAERI, and which are of benefit to all researchers 
(Universality); 
  (3) data that JAERI, as an independent research organ, 
should 
make available to outside users (Neutrality). 
  It was also determined that database selection should stress 
the degree of need as well as JAERI's development capacity. The 
working group concluded that it would be impossible for JAERI to 
undertake all the work involved in upgrading its databases on 
its own, and recommended that a full-time organization be 
established for this purpose. 
  Based on these findings, JAERI has continued to strive to 
upgrade its databases, but personnel and budget restrictions 
have made it impossible to keep work moving ahead on schedule. 
However, certain databases with high priorities have already 
been upgraded and are being accessed and used by outside 
researchers. JAERI is also putting together a system that will 
enable its Information Systems Center to maintain and manage 
databases and computer codes capable of being utilized by 
outside parties. 
  I would like to introduce here a number of JAERI databases 
that currently offer good possibilities for outside use. These 
include databases on nuclear fusion experiments (Originality); 
databases containing nuclear data and atomic molecule data 
(Universality); and a PA database, food irradiation database and 
an emergency technical advisory support system database 
(Neutrality). I will not discuss JPDR dismantling data or 
comprehensive data on materials, since these topics are dealt 
with in a separate article. 
<H5>  2. Nuclear Fusion Experiment Databases </H5>
<H5>  2.1 Overview </H5>
  At present, the goals of nuclear fusion experiments include 
using experimental data to clarify the transport phenomenon 
inside plasma; discovering methods for generating higher 
performance plasma; and designing a nuclear fusion reactor based 
on this knowhow. JAERI has constructed the following three types 
of databases to help it achieve these goals. 
<H5>  2.2 Contents of Databases </H5>
<H5>  (1) Experiment Databases </H5>
<H5>  * JT-60 Experiment Database </H5>
  This database contains information related to experiments 
conducted using the JT-60 critical plasma testing device, and is 
actually comprised of four individual databases: 
  [1] a measurements database; 
  [2] a system database (data related to plasma control); 
  [3] a neutral particle heat database; 
  [4] a high frequency heat database. 
  A single shot experiment generates 10MB of data, and the 
JT-60 experiment database comprises data accumulated from 
experiments totaling roughly 20,000 shots. 
<H5>  * JFT-2M Experiment Database </H5>
  This database is used to store experiment data derived from 
JAERI's medium-size high-performance JFT-2M Tokamak development 
testing device. The contents of this database are similar to 
those of the JT-60 database. Each single shot experiment 
generates about 50KB of data, and the JFT-2M experiment database 
holds roughly 50,000 shots worth of experimental data. 
<H5>  (2) Refined Experiment Databases </H5>
  These databases refine the above described experiment 
databases to meet utilization objectives. 
<H5>  * DARTS </H5>
  This system comprises retrieval databases (up to 6KB per 
shot) and tools for retrieving data from the huge JT-60 
database. A retrieval database is a database that extracts data 
characteristic of experiment shots from an experiment database. 
<H5>  * H Mode Database </H5>
  High efficiency containment modes (H modes) are occurring 
experimentally as containment modes during Tokamak plasma 
heating. This database edits data related to H mode experiments 
taken from the JFT-2M experiment database. 
<H5>  (3) JT-60 Experiment Analysis Databases </H5>
  JAERI developed the ADAM database to handle large-scale 
simulations of experimental data. This database comprises [1] a 
magnetofluid equilibrium database, [2] a Tokamak transport 
analysis code input database, and [3] a Tokamak transport 
analysis code output database. 
<H5>  2.3 Retrieval and Utilization Methods </H5>
  Basically, the above databases are configured into tree 
structures consisting of huge lists of shot numbers. Users can 
obtain desired data simply by inputting the shot number and ID 
name. The database management system (DBMS) was developed 
entirely in-house. 
  Of the above described databases, portions of the data 
contained in DARTS has been released and can be accessed via a 
magnetic nuclear fusion database at the University of Texas in 
the United States. Also, portions of the JFT-2M H mode database 
have been registered and are open to the public via the 
Supercomputer Center at the Livermore National Research 
Institute in the United States, where databases on H modes in 
the world's six Tokamak devices are stored. None of the other 
databases have been made available for public use yet. However, 
JAERI has taken the occasion of joint Japan-U.S. research on 
nuclear fusion to begin studying ways to open these other 
databases to the public as well. 
<H5>  3. Nuclear Data </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Overview </H5>
  As used here, nuclear data refers primarily to various data 
related to reactions between neutrons and atomic nuclei required 
for atomic reactor computations, i.e. nuclear reaction cross 
sections and angular distributions, etc. It also includes 
reaction data on charged particles and photons, as well as 
nuclear structure and karyolysis data. 
  This data was obtained via experiments, and there tend to be 
discrepancies and errors between the experimental values. There 
are also certain nuclear species and energy domains for which 
there are no experimental values. This data, therefore, is not 
suitable for reactor computations as-is. To make it suitable, it 
is necessary to study the experimental values in detail and 
select the correct ones, and where there are no experimental 
values, to make good use of nuclear reaction theory and systems 
to assign unique recommendation values that cover the entire 
energy domain for all required physical quantities. This work is 
known as evaluating nuclear data, and nuclear data that has been 
evaluated in this way is referred to as evaluated nuclear data. 
And when this evaluated nuclear data is compiled into a 
fixed-format database, it is referred to as an evaluated nuclear 
data library. An evaluated nuclear data library is the ultimate 
goal for nuclear data. Users then process this nuclear data to 
meet their own objectives, and utilize it in the form of group 
constants. 
  The evaluation of nuclear data has to start with the 
retrieval of huge amounts of experimental data. For this reason, 
international cooperation is vital. Therefore, a network of four 
neutron nuclear data centers was established in the 1960's. 
These four centers are located in four different regions of the 
world, and individual international centers were set up to take 
responsibility for the operation of these respective neutron 
nuclear data centers (the international center for Japan is 
called the NEA Databank). This system enables experimental data 
and bibliographic databases generated in the respective areas of 
responsibility (AORs) to be shared via the network, and serviced 
within the respective AORs. 
  In Japan, JAERIs Nuclear Data Center, with the cooperation 
of 
the SIGMA Committee, was developed into the Japanese Evaluated 
Nuclear Data Library (JENDL). 
<H5>  3.2 Contents </H5>
  Nuclear data is the most widely utilized data of all the 
data 
stored in JAERI's databases. Let's discuss the principal kinds 
of data currently being managed by the Nuclear Data Center. 
<H5>  * NESTOR 2 </H5>
  This is an experimental value database, and was constructed 
by converting data obtained from the NEA Databank into an 
original JAERI database. This database currently holds 
approximately 2.5 million data elements. 
<H5>  * JENDL </H5>
  This is Japan's standard evaluated nuclear data library, and 
is an encyclopedia of the results of Japan's nuclear data 
activities. The latest version of this library, JENDL-3, 
contains data on 324 nuclear species, and approximately 980,000 
data records. 
  And in addition to these general files, JENDL is also in the 
process of becoming the repository for special purpose files 
containing evaluated data on dosimetry, gas generation, 
activation, (a,n) reactions, nuclear fusion neutron engineering, 
actinides, photonuclear reactions, kerma (phonetic) and high 
energy. 
<H5>  * JNDC FP Karyolysis Data Library </H5>
  This is a data library for FP karyolysis heat computations, 
and is another major achievement of the SIGMA Committee. The 
latest version of this data library contains data on 1,227 
nuclear species, and roughly 9,500 records. 
<H5>  * ENSDF </H5>
  This is an evaluated nuclear structure/karyolysis data 
library, and under the auspices of the IAEA, JAERI received 
international cooperation in evaluating the data contained 
herein by mass number. Evaluation allotment in Japan worked out 
to A = 188-127, and as a database, the ENSDF data library 
contains approximately 880,000 records covering all mass numbers. 
<H5>  3.3 Retrieval and Utilization Methods </H5>
  There is no need for a complicated DBMS since nuclear data 
is 
generally used by nuclear species and by reaction. 
  Data stored in JENDL et al. as evaluated data is saved to a 
data retrieval system where users can call this information up 
to their display screens by specifying in an interactive mode 
the nuclear species name and reaction name. They can also view 
numerical data in this way. Users are capable, therefore, of 
using all the evaluated data stored at the Nuclear Data Center. 
  Beginning with JENDL, all the nuclear data maintained by the 
Nuclear Data Center is available to the public. Those wishing to 
utilize this data need only fill out a specified application 
form and submit it to the Nuclear Data Center in order to access 
its databases. 
<H5>  4. Atomic Molecule Data </H5>
<H5>  4.1 Overview </H5>
  The atomic molecule data maintained at JAERI's Nuclear Data 
Center is related to nuclear fusion plasma. More specifically, 
this data consists of: 
  1) collision process data such as ionization cross sections 
and charge transfer cross sections of ions and atomic molecules 
in plasma, 
  2) data on the interaction of particles in the plasma with 
the first wall and the diverter, 
  3) ion spectral data for identifying impurities in plasma. 
  There is no network for bibliographic or experimental data 
for atomic molecule data like the four international centers 
established for nuclear data, which means that researchers must 
search for experimental data on their own. However, a system has 
been put together recently under the auspices of the IAEA for 
international cooperation in evaluating atomic molecule data. 
This system is called the ALADDIN network system, and Japan is 
contributing data to this system. 
<H5>  4.2 Contents </H5>
  The following databases are currently being managed by the 
Nuclear Data Center. 
<H5>  * Bibliographic Data </H5>
  JAERI, in cooperation with IAEA and ORNL, has been storing 
bibliographic data since 1987. 
<H5>  * AMSTOR </H5>
  This is an atomic molecule experiment database that stores 
roughly 80,000 records. 
<H5>  * JEAMDL </H5>
  This is an evaluated atomic molecule data library. In 
response to increasing requirements for this information, this 
database has been expanded to include JEAMDL-1, -2 and -3. JAERI 
is currently in the process of constructing JEAMDL-4 using data 
requested from ITER and FER. 
  Roughly 180,000 data elements are stored in JEAMDL-3 
consisting of evaluated data on approximately 300 types of 
collision processes involving H, H2, He, Li and ion impurities, 
plus Ti-Cu, Kr and Mo ion spectral data and elementary process 
data on particle recycling. 
<H5>  4.3 Retrieval and Utilization Methods </H5>
  The DBMS for atomic molecule data is a very simple system 
similar to the one for nuclear data. Persons wishing to utilize 
atomic molecule databases can do so simply by applying to the 
Nuclear Data Center. 
<H5>  5. STA's Nuclear Power PA Database </H5>
<H5>  5.1 Overview </H5>
  The importance of nuclear power is beyond doubt, and for 
that 
reason people must possess an accurate understanding of it. This 
makes the communication of accurate information on nuclear power 
imperative. However, nuclear power-related information is 
diverse, to the extent that even the experts are incapable of 
knowing all there is to know. This leads to instances where 
misleading and/or contradictory information gets circulated, 
raising the fear that people will become suspicious and 
distrustful of nuclear power. 
  In order to rectify this situation, the Science and 
Technology Agency (STA) commissioned JAERI to develop a nuclear 
power PA database containing accurate information on nuclear 
power and related issues that can be retrieved via 
telecommunications lines. Since this database is to serve as a 
kind of electronic encyclopedia on nuclear power, and as such, 
will contain various and diverse information, to ensure 
accuracy, JAERI is coordinating the documents and other 
materials and editing the contents of the database in 
cooperation with the National Institute of Radiological Sciences 
(NIRS), the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development 
Corporation (PNC), the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum Inc. 
(JAIF), the Japan Nuclear Power Culture Promotion Foundation and 
the Nuclear Power Safety Research Association. 
  For the time being, JAERI feels that users of this database 
will be more or less limited to government officials, PA 
instructors/lecturers, educators and others closely involved in 
nuclear power PA. 
  Development of this database got underway in 1989, and the 
first stage of construction is scheduled to be completed this 
year. 
<H5>  5.2 Contents </H5>
  This database is configured in a tree structure that 
cascades 
down from general to intermediate to specific items and finally 
to the various details concerning these items. The detailed data 
comprise titles, summaries, keywords, texts, diagrams, and 
reference materials. 
  General items of information consist of the following 16 
items: 1) energy, 2) electric power, 3) national policies and 
plans concerning nuclear power, 4) nuclear power generation 
technology and its current status, 5) nuclear fuel cycle 
technology and its current status, 6) nuclear reactor 
obsolescence devices, 7) nuclear power safety regulations, 8) 
operation management data, 9) nuclear power safety research, 10) 
new uses for nuclear power, 11) radiation, 12) international 
cooperation, 13) public opinion, 14) overseas trends, 15) Q&amp;A 
and 16) supplementary data. In editing this data, JAERI is 
taking care to contribute to users' decisions by making the 
bibliographic data readable and easy-to-understand (complete 
with diagrams), avoiding a PA style and stating facts. Overall, 
approximately 1,500 titles are being input into this database, 
along with roughly 2,400 diagrams and about 300 reference works. 
<H5>  5.3 Retrieval and Utilization Methods </H5>
  The three main methods of retrieval capable with this 
database are: 
  1) vertical retrieval whereby you retrieve displayed menus 
sequentially beginning with general items, 
  2) word retrieval whereby retrieval is accomplished by 
inputting the appropriate words, 
  3) retrieval via the serial numbers (structural numbers) for 
each title. 
  Retrieval is achieved using a personal computer or dedicated 
word processor, communications software and ordinary telephone 
lines. Retrieved data is either saved to a floppy disk or 
printed out using a printer. Diagrams incorporated into the data 
can be obtained via a facsimile machine. 
  Since this database is currently being operated on a trial 
basis, usage is limited to individuals registered with JAERI. 
But JAERI is in the process of hooking its mainframe computer up 
to a domestic packet-switched network, and plans to make the 
database public by April, 1994. 
<H5>  6. Emergency Technical Advisory Support System: COSTA </H5>
<H5>  6.1 Overview </H5>
  In the unlikely event an accident should occur at a nuclear 
power plant, and it should impact or threaten to impact on the 
surrounding community, an emergency technical advisory 
organization (hereafter referred to as the advisory team), 
established by the Nuclear Safety Commission and comprised of 
nuclear power specialists will be called in to give a broad 
range of advice on everything from problems inside the plant to 
environmental impact evaluations and safeguard activities. In 
support of these advisory activities, JAERI was commissioned by 
the STA to develop a computer-based emergency technical support 
system called COSTA. JAERI's Emergency Systems Laboratory 
commenced work on COSTA in 1985. 
  Of the data required by the advisory team, COSTA is used 
primarily to rapidly access the following information concerning 
the inside of nuclear power plants: 
  a) edited graphs and tables showing accident-related data 
transmitted from the plant (pressure in primary systems and the 
operability of safety equipment, etc.), 
  b) the soundness of the pressure vessel, storage vessel and 
fuel cladding that serves as the FP containment barrier, time 
until each of these elements loses its soundness, and estimated 
time of FP discharge into the environment, the volume of that 
discharge and its effect, 
  c) samples of analyses of plant behavior during simulated 
accidents, 
  d) data on equipment specifications for the pertinent plant, 
  e) accident malfunction data generated in the past at the 
pertinent plant and/or accident malfunction data similar to that 
of the accident in question, 
  f) exposure dosage predictions for areas surrounding the 
site 
based on simple computer models, 
  g) data related to those operations carried out in support 
of 
the emergency advisory team. 
  There is also another system already in operation called the 
SPEEDI Network System that predicts environmental radiation 
impact in times of emergency. JAERI plans to integrate these two 
systems in future to create an Emergency Technical Advisory 
Bureau (ETAB) support system. 
<H5>  6.2 Contents of System </H5>
  In order to achieve the above described functions, the COSTA 
system configuration consists of basic databases and information 
processing programs. 
  There are three kinds of basic databases in the COSTA 
system. 
These are: 
  a) a nuclear power generation database (a database on the 
nuclear power plant itself complete with schematic diagrams), 
  b) an accident history database (a database containing 
information on past accidents and malfunctions) 
  c) a support database (a database containing information on 
accident analyses and experimental data). Image data related to 
databases a) and b) are stored in an electronic filing system. 
  The information processing programs are used to carry out 
comprehensive analyses of data stored in the databases and 
accident information communicated from the plant at the time of 
the accident. These programs comprise three types: 
  a) a database information retrieval and display program, 
  b) a program for determining the soundness of the FP barrier 
and for predicting FP discharge, 
  c) a consultation system. 
  The consultation system incorporates a database of the 
emergency procedures followed by the emergency technical 
advisory team during an emergency situation and is designed to 
increase the efficiency of the advisory team's actions. 
<H5>  6.3 Utilization Methods </H5>
  Due to the very nature of this system, it is designed to be 
used only by experts in emergency situations. However, since 
there is no way of predicting when an emergency will occur, the 
hardware and software are continuously maintained so that the 
system can be used at any time.
