VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS; 
FIREPLACE OWNERS TO BE PAID FOR REPAIRS 
Residents in two Thousand Oaks housing tracts where dangerous fireplaces have 
been installed will soon be compensated for repairs on their faulty hearths, 
city officials said Friday. 
Barry J. Branagan, the city's director of building and safety, said Thousand 
Oaks is nearing agreement with the insurance companies of an Agoura Hills 
fireplace framer. 
The city has accused the framer of placing potentially combustible wood around 
the fireplaces instead of bricks and mortar. 
Branagan said the city hopes to announce the details of the agreement next 
week. 
A group of Thousand Oaks residents, claiming that local building inspectors 
failed to warn them 10 years ago about the dangerous fireplaces, is threatening 
to take the city to court unless the homeowners are compensated. 
As result, the city has been attempting to negotiate a settlement with the 
insurance company of the fireplace framer on behalf of the 200 residents in two 
housing developments in the Newbury Park and Wildwood areas. 
Perry Angress, who owns a home with a faulty fireplace, said he questions 
whether the city is near an agreement with the insurance company. 
"That's what they said last week and the week before," Angress said. "I don't 
want to be negative, but actions speak louder than words." 
The claims are a prerequisite to a class-action lawsuit, which would be filed 
in Ventura Municipal Court if negotiations between the city and the insurance 
company fail, Angress said. TINA DAUNT
