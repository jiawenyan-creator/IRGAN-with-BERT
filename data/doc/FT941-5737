FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Nike signs licensing deal with
Alpargatas
Nike, the US running shoe company, has concluded a five-year licensing
agreement with Argentina's Alpargatas to distribute its products in
Argentina and Brazil.
Nike also formed a joint venture with Alpargatas, a leading clothing and
sportswear company, to market and distribute Nike products in Argentina and
Uruguay.
Alpargatas maintained it was appointed to take over the Nike franchise from
a Brazilian company because of its success in building up the business in
Argentina.
Mr Juan Avellaneda, the Alpargatas executive in charge of the Nike
operation, said his company had raised annual sales at a rate of 30 per cent
a year since 1990 to Dollars 70m last year.
Mr Avellaneda expects sales in Brazil to increase faster than in Argentina,
which he forecasts to grow at 15-20 per cent a year. Alpargatas will pay
Nike a 6 per cent royalty on sales.
The deal with Nike is the latest in an increasing number involving local and
multinational companies aiming to integrate operations in the region.
