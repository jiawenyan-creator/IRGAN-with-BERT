FT  31 OCT 94 / Trademark legislation expected to save business up to Pounds
60m
Businesses will be able to register three-dimensional shapes, sounds and
smells as trademarks for the first time today as new legislation comes into
force.
The Trade Marks Act is designed to streamline and simplify procedures for
protecting brands and bring UK law into line with the rest of the European
Union.
The Patent Office estimates that the law will save British business up to
Pounds 60m in the first year and then Pounds 30m a year.
Half the savings in the first year will come from the UK's ratification of
the protocol to the Madrid Agreement on the international registration of
trademarks. This will allow UK companies to register their marks in all
countries which are party to the agreement in a single application.
The Patent Office is holding a draw for the first mark registered under the
new law - number 2,000,001. On November 10 trademark 2,000,001 will be
selected at random from applications received by hand between 9am and 10am
this morning at the Patent Office in London or Newport, Gwent. The Trade
Marks Registry expects more than 1,000 applications in the first hour.
Bass, the brewer, which was awarded trademark number one for its red
triangle in 1876, hopes to win 2,000,001 for a similar symbol used for Bass
Ale. The cost of an application will be Pounds 225. Registrations will be
renewable every 10 years.
The laws have produced a welter of advice from trademark lawyers. London
solicitors Lewis Silkin said that once branding had been protected there
would be no need to prove established goodwill and misrepresentation to
establish passing off, or to fight infringement of copyright or design right
battles.
Some marks will still be excluded from registration. These include names
which are exclusively descriptive or geographical, and shapes which result
from the nature of the goods or which give substantial value to the goods.
