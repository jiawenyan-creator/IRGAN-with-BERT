  [Text] Our country and the Yemeni working class today 
celebrated 1 May, the International Labor Day. On this 
important occasion, a major speech rally was held this morning 
at the Culture Hall in Sanaa's Cultural Center. Brother Dr. 
Muhammad Sa'id al- 'Attar, deputy prime minister, chairman of 
the Higher Investment Commission, and industry minister, 
attended. 
  Brother Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al-'Attar delivered the state's 
and government's speech. He said he was happy to attend this 
event and share with the Yemeni working class its celebrations 
of the International Labor Day. 
  He said the Yemeni labor movement has played an honorable 
and 
pioneering role in defending the revolution and the republic, in 
achieving unity, and in establishment the Yemeni Republic on 22 
May 1990, noting that the country will soon celebrate its fourth 
anniversary. The deputy prime minister explained that this 
anniversary will come as our country experiences serious 
political and economic conditions as a result of the political 
crisis. He said some enemies of unity and democracy want this 
crisis to continue at the expense of the citizens' pressing 
issues and daily, urgent living conditions and worries, 
particularly those of workers. He said the current phase 
experienced by the state of unity compels the various trends of 
the labor movement to confront serious national missions to 
defend and protect the unity and preserve its continuity and 
survival, according to the pledge and accord document.
