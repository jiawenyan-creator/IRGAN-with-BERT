FT  27 AUG 92 / Pakistan calls for ceasefire
PAKISTAN appealed yesterday for a 72-hour ceasefire in Afghanistan where two
weeks of fighting in Kabul between the rebel Hezb-e-Islami faction and the
mujahideen government have killed more than 1,800 people, Reuter reports
from Kabul.
Relentless exchanges of artillery and rocket fire have pounded the capital.
Hundreds of people streamed out of the city during a lull in the
bombardments yesterday.
Pakistan called for the ceasefire to start from noon today. There was no
immediate reaction from the Afghan factions.
The appeal came as Afghanistan's vice-president and an all-party group
prepared to set up a base outside Kabul to hold peace talks between
dissident mujahideen and embattled President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
Polish and Yemeni diplomats had earlier left Kabul by road for Pakistan,
abandoning hope for an early truce.
