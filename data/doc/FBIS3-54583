  [Text] Timor Goksel, official spokesman of the UN Interim 
Force in Lebanon, has announced that a preliminary investigation 
into the detonation of a land mine in the al-Kihyam area shows 
that while members of the Swedish contingent were carrying out 
maneuvers in a mine field, one of the soldiers made an error 
that triggered a mine explosion and injured three soldiers. 
  Goksel said that one of the wounded soldiers suffered grave 
injuries and was transferred to Haifa's Ramban Hospital. The 
other two were only slightly wounded, he said.
