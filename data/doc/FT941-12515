FT  29 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Water shares respond
Water shares were among the market's best performers with the shares
responding to renewed hopes of imminent interest rate cuts in the UK, which
would focus market attention on the well above average yields available in
the sector.
There was also an additional boost for the sub-sector as marketmakers were
thought to have been alerted to stories that SG Warburg might be about to
publish a strong buy note on the sector. And the market was alive with hints
that many fund managers were switching out of the consumer sectors, such as
breweries and food retailing where there are threats to dividend growth
prospects, into the strong income areas such as waters and electricity
stocks.
Premium water stocks raced higher on the Warburg push. Anglian added 6 to
572p, North West 16 to 578p, Severn Trent 14 to 610p and Thames 16 to 592p.
Kleinwort Benson was responsible for driving National Power up 10 to 485p,
while the market's big income funds continued to chase Scottish Hydro, which
raced up 16 to 465p and Scottish Power put on 17 1/2 to 474 1/2 p.
Food manufacturers were under pressure from the Sainsbury news as investors
fretted over the impact on suppliers of tighter retailing margins. Among
those hit, Unigate fell 16 1/2 to 392 1/2 p, United Biscuits 9 to 369p and
Northern Foods 15 to 232p.
Calls to reassure city analysts helped TI Group recover from a sharp fall
early in the session. The retreat followed reports in the French press of
problems in the landing gear in one Airbus 330 operated by Air Inter, that
led to the suspension of flights using the aircraft. At the day's worst the
shares were down 20 at 395p, but recovered to close 7 off at 408p, on volume
of 1.9m.
Market watchers were cheered by encouraging news on the new Rolls-Royce
Trent 800 jet engine. The shares firmed a penny to 183 1/2 p, on volume of
5m.
Shares in Smiths Industries gave up 12 to 474p, after James Capel trimmed
its profits estimate for the year to July 1995. A large line of stock was
also said to be overhanging the shares.
A spate of downgradings following a series of city presentations on Thursday
brought a sharp fall for international trading group Inchcape. The shares
surrendered 20 to 586p, as BZW and Nomura reduced current profits
expectations.
Courtaulds Textiles moved ahead 19 to 555p after announcing that it had
bought most of the stockings and tights business of Hartstone, the leather
and consumer goods group for Pounds 45.4m. Hartstone shares closed 2 lower
at 68p.
