  [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- Coal mines of Korea 
are effecting innovations in production. 
  The Sunchon District coal mining complex has produced 
100,000 
more tons of coal in the first three or so months of this year 
than in the like period last year, and is overfulfilling its 
daily production quotas, having set itself a goal of carrying 
out its assignments for this month ahead of the set time. 
  The Tokchon District coal mining complex has increased the 
tunnelling speed 1.3 times as against the same period of the 
previous month and is putting out more coal than planned by 
actively introducing new technical innovation proposals. 
  The Pukchang District coal mining complex is effecting 
innovations in tunnelling and coal production by securing 
several thousand cubic metres of wooden props and more blasting 
materials by its own efforts. 
  Coal mines under the Kaechon District coal mining complex 
including Namjon, Pongchon and Choyang coal mines are producing 
more coal by scrupulously organising and commanding production.
