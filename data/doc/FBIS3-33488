  [Text] Argentine Vice Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella 
stressed on 21 February that Argentina's approval of a possible 
bombardment of Serbian positions in Sarajevo by NATO forces 
served to "break" the UN "Security Council's deadlock situation." 
  In remarks to a radio station, the Argentine vice foreign 
minister announced that Argentina was the first country to take 
this stance, through a note Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella sent 
to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus- Ghali. 
  Discussing the end of the Serbian siege of the Bosnian city 
of Sarajevo, Petrella explained that the "lack of a consensus" 
on the political and strategic management of the warning 
measures among the United States, France, and Russia was the 
source of some "hesitation that has existed so far in the 
implementation of the Security Council's measures." 
  Breaking this deadlock situation was possible "in many ways" 
thanks to a proposal Argentina raised with Ghali, asking him "to 
determine, with his wisdom, how the air force element was going 
to be used." Petrella also noted that our country offered the 
International Red Cross "to take care of refugees or orphans." 
He said this offer had been "inspired by an idea raised by 
President Menem, in case it becomes necessary."
