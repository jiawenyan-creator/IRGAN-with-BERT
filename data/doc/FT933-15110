FT  10 JUL 93 / Letter: Postal insurance jumped too
Sir, H N Harrison's letter (June 2) about the 83 per cent increase in the
charge for recorded delivery is only half the story.
The Post Office has also increased the price of registered post from Pounds
1.90 to Pounds 3, while at the same time reducing the insurance cover
provided - from Pounds 950 to Pounds 500. For those of us who regularly use
the service, this represents a whopping 200 per cent increase in the cost of
insurance per Pounds covered.
