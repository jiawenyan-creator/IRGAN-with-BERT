FT  08 SEP 93 / Lobby against unfair sacking
THE TUC, in alliance with the National Association of Citizens Advice
Bureaux, plans to lobby the government to improve workers' legal protection
from unfair dismissal.
At present people who work more than 16 hours a week fail to qualify for
such protection until they have worked full-time for their employer for two
years.
Ms Ann Abraham, chief executive of the association, said yesterday that
employers were systematically sacking workers a few days before they reached
the two-year threshold - and sometimes re-employing them again a few days
later - simply to stop them from qualifying for employment protection under
the 1986 Wages Act.
The TUC and the association want the government to reduce the qualifying
period for unfair dismissal to six months.
Ms Abraham said no other EC country had such a restrictive and lengthy
qualifying period.
