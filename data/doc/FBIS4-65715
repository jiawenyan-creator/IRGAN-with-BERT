  [Text] The United States has asked the Netherlands, Britain 
and France to help in accommodating Haitian refugees in the 
Caribbean area. The Dutch Government has promised to raise the 
matter with the governments of the six Dutch Caribbean islands, 
but it had no idea how many Haitians, if any, could be received 
there. The U.S. request follows reports of increasing numbers 
of Haitians fleeing the country since the United States relaxed 
its asylum policy for Haitian refugees earlier this month.
