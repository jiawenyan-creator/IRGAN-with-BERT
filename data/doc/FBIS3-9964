  [Text] Although the PNP [Peruvian National Police] high 
command has denied it, over 20 PNP officers assigned to the 
National Counterterrrorism Directorate (Dincote), were 
transferred over the last few days to the National Intelligence 
Service (SIN). 
  Reliable sources have informed EXPRESO that the transfers 
occurred at the end of January, and that it included a 
high-ranking Dincote colonel and other PNP unit chiefs. 
  It must be noted that EXPRESO was the first to report, at 
the 
beginning of February, that the PNP had implemented a 30 percent 
reduction in Dincote personnel. 
  This reduction is part of the announced "streamlining" of 
police force personnel, which was disclosed not so long ago by 
PNP General Director Victor Alva Plasencia. 
  According to the same source, Dincote has already submitted 
to the PNP General Staff the names of the 300 Dincote agents who 
will be fired. 
  The officer added that it is still unknown whether all of 
these agents will be transferred to the SIN or to other police 
units, and that this situation is causing uncertainty among 
Dincote personnel.
