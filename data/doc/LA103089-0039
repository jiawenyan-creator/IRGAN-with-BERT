WINDS CAUSE SCATTERED POWER OUTAGES 
Powerful Santa Ana winds Sunday knocked down small trees, tore off branches, 
activated burglar alarms and caused brief electrical outages for about 4,000 
residences in Chatsworth, Canoga Park and Granada Hills. 
The northeasterly winds gusted to nearly 40 m.p.h. across the northern San 
Fernando Valley, causing the National Weather Service to issue a high-wind 
advisory. 
Dorothy Jensen, a Los Angeles Department of Water and Power spokeswoman, said 
scattered power outages were reported beginning about 4 a.m. and a varying 
number of customers were without power until shortly after 10 a.m. 
She said the outages are caused by the winds blowing wires together, making 
them short-circuit. Branches blown from trees also knocked wires down, she 
said. 
Glendale police said the wind was activating burglar alarms, causing an 
unusually high number of false alarms to be reported.
