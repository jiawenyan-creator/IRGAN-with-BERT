WORLD; 
ISRAEL WARNS CARTER AGAINST ALIGNING WITH ARABS ON VISIT 
Israel, under U.S. pressure to convene peace talks with Palestinians, warned 
former President Jimmy Carter today not to side with the Arabs on his Middle 
East trip next week. 
Carter forged the historic 1979 Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, and Israeli 
newspapers say he would now like to mediate the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
The former President will meet Israeli and Palestinian leaders when he visits 
four Middle Eastern countries and the Israeli-occupied territories. 
But the daily Haaretz said Israeli security officials are worried that Carter 
would take the side of Palestinians waging a 27-month-old revolt in the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
