FT  02 MAR 92 / Azeris claim Armenians 'killing hundreds'
AZERI refugees, many of whom walked for days across snow-covered mountains,
yesterday accused Armenian militants backed by Russian soldiers of killing
hundreds in the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, Reuter reports from
Agdam, Azerbaijan.
Relatives of the dead, led by women beating their breasts and scratching
their faces in grief, burst into a government guest house in Agdam to demand
that steps be taken to evacuate corpses from Khojali, another Azeri
stronghold just inside Karabakh.
The mob, about 50 strong, smashed furniture and crockery before leaving to
join several hundred more refugees milling through the streets, where red,
green and blue Azeri national flags were draped with black ribbons.
'Help us. You must do something,' screamed one woman who said her husband
and two sons were killed when Armenians seized Khojali last week.
The Azeri government, which has declared a three-day mourning period, said
more than 1,000 people were killed in the attack on Khojali, a town of about
10,000 people.
Armenia put the casualty figure much lower, and said the Armenian population
of Karabakh has been forced to defend itself from Azeri attacks.
'This is a gross exaggeration. The figure could be nowhere near 1,000,' said
a security official in the Armenian capital Yerevan.
A government spokesman said Armenian settlements were under artillery fire
from the Azeri lines, with the villages of Sekhsulan and Yarymjan seized and
set ablaze.
In the past four years of undeclared war over the Transcaucasian territory,
more than 1,000 people have been killed. Nagorno-Karabakh is populated by
Armenians but has been administered by Azerbaijan since 1923.
Military commanders in Moscow have repeatedly denied that their men are
involved in the Azeri-Armenian conflict and on Friday ordered them out of
the enclave.
