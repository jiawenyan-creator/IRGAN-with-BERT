FT  03 AUG 93 / Tyne and Wear beats investment targets
PRIVATE-SECTOR investment in Tyne and Wear Development Corporation sites
exceeded its target by 43 per cent in the last financial year, the
corporation's annual report and financial statements, published today, show.
In the year to March 31 the private sector channelled Pounds 86.2m into
sites alongside the rivers Tyne and Wear, against a target of Pounds 60.3m,
bringing total investment since the corporation was set up in 1987 to Pounds
530m, including public funds of Pounds 186.1m.
The report says this investment has built almost 2.3m sq ft of industrial
and commercial property, completed 846 homes, helped create 9,810 jobs and
reclaimed 760 acres of derelict land.
Mr Alastair Balls, chief executive, said that of the 600,000 sq ft of new
commercial space - equally split between office and industrial development -
completed during the year, nearly 95 per cent was already let.
The report says diversity has been the key to the corporation's success.
