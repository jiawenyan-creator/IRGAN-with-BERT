WETLAND SURVIVES, WINS 
In a ceremony Wednesday at Upper Newport Bay, the 752-acre ecological reserve 
was formally included as part of the California Wildlands Program, the first of 
its kind in the nation, according to state officials. It is one of only nine 
areas in the state and one of only three in Southern California to be included, 
which underscores the great value of the reserve and the importance of ensuring 
that it remains in its natural state, its environment protected. 
The bay property would now be a private marina had it not been for the vision 
of a handful of environmentalists about 25 years ago. They made the 
irreplaceable Upper Bay area one of the county's first battlegrounds against 
indiscriminate development, and they won. After 11 years of conflict and 
effort, the area was designated in 1975 as one of the largest reserves of its 
kind in the state -- a coastal wetland to remain in perpetuity as home to 
hundreds of species of birds, fish and mammals. 
The reserve is an oasis of natural beauty and serenity surrounded by the urban 
clatter and clutter of jet aircraft, autos, homes, hotels and commercial 
buildings. Guided tours are offered. It has become a popular place for 
naturalists, fishermen, bird watchers, hikers, joggers and people just seeking 
escape to the peace and quiet the Upper Bay still provides. 
Although access to the refuge is and will remain free, the state's new wild 
lands program is using the reserve's drawing power to generate revenue by 
charging people a fee for the guided nature walks and demonstrations provided 
by the state Department of Fish and Game. The money raised will be used to help 
cover the costs of preserving the Upper Bay's natural habitat and putting even 
more of its acreage into public reserve, goals that are well worth continued 
public support.
