  [Text] Russia's Foreign Minister hopes that direct contacts 
between the Federal Assembly and Poland's Seim (parliament) will 
help to get rid of "some faults" in bilateral relations. Andrey 
Kozyrev expressed this view after a meeting with the Polish Seim 
Marshal (speaker of the lower house of parliament IF [INTERFAX]) 
Jozef Oleksy. 
  As Kozyrev said, "a paradoxical friendship is evolving 
between Russia and Poland. The paradox lies in the fact that we 
have good relations resting on a sound legal basis, good 
contacts at the level of presidents, prime ministers, and 
foreign ministers, but then there are some odd press statements, 
especially in the Polish press. We also have extremists, who 
make irresponsible statements from time to time, but they never 
make them officially," Kozyrev remarked. 
  In his opinion, Moscow and Warsaw "need to strengthen the 
legal base of their common interests and remove all faults in 
bilateral ties."
