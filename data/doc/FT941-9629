FT  14 FEB 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Snow man's land
Travellers to Japan today should check the status of their flights before
leaving for the airport. The worst snow storm to hit Tokyo and its
surrounding areas in 25 years left the country's road, rail and air traffic
paralysed yesterday.
Shinkansen 'bullet train' services were running slow, airports were crammed
with passengers unable to take flights on Saturday and most main highways
leading to the capital were closed.
Saturday's storm meant many international flights heading for Tokyo were
diverted to Hokkaido in the north. Tokyo's main international airport at
Narita was closed and cut off from the capital on the weekend.
