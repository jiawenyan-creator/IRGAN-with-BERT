BRIEFCASE: HEALTH CARE; 
PACIFICARE LOSES ACQUISITION BID FOR HEALS AFTER FAILING TO MEET DEADLINE 
PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., a cash-rich health maintenance organization 
eager to buy smaller companies in the same business, has stumbled twice on the 
acquisition trail. 
Recently rebuffed in its attempt to buy bankrupt Maxicare Health Plans, 
Cypress-based PacifiCare also lost out on its bid to buy Oakland-based HEALS 
Health Plan, a financially troubled HMO that had been courting suitors for a 
year. 
Michael Bhoostelaere, HEALS' vice president of sales and marketing, said 
PacifiCare was too involved in negotiating with Maxicare to meet the timetables 
set by HEALS in its own sale negotiations. "It's a shame," he said. 
"They felt they needed to move on at a different rate than we could," 
acknowledged Wayne Lowell, PacifiCare's chief financial officer. PacifiCare 
said earlier this month that it was seriously considering making an offer to 
acquire HEALS. 
Bhoostelaere said HEALS has signed a letter of intent to negotiate a sales 
agreement with Qual-Med, an HMO based in Monte Vista, Colo., with about 150,000 
members in five western states. He said the sale is expected to be completed by 
the end of summer. 
Lowell said PacifiCare is disappointed with HEALS' decision. But he added: "We 
think they are a fine organization and wish them a lot of luck in their 
endeavors." 
Not that PacifiCare has given up its quest. "We are still looking at a lot of 
things," said Lowell, declining to be more specific.
