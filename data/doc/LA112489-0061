NATION IN BRIEF; 
MISSOURI; 
BODY IN WELL LINKED TO STRING OF SLAYINGS 
A corpse weighted down with a concrete block was pulled from a well on a farm, 
bringing to five the number of bodies discovered in a murder investigation 
focusing on an elderly couple. The discovery near the town of Ludlow, Mo., came 
in the seventh week of an investigation into the disappearance of drifters 
hired to work for Ray and Faye Copeland, a farm couple from nearby Mooresville. 
Copeland is 75 and his wife is 68. Three of the bodies have been identified, 
and the Copelands were charged with murder in those deaths. They are in jail on 
$500,000 bail each, suspected of killing their employees after using them to 
buy cattle fraudulently.
