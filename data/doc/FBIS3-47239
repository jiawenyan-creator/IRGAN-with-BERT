  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- Inter-Korean trade fell 6 
percent in 1993 from 1992 because of North Korea's foreign 
exchange situation and overall coolness in relations, the Trade, 
Industry and Energy Ministry said Tuesday. 
  Two-way trade last year was 200,643,000 U.S. dollars, 
compared with 213,503,000 dollars in 1992. 
  South Korea sold 10,224,000 dollars of goods to the North, 
down 20.2 percent, and purchased 190,419,000 dollars of goods, 
down 5.1 percent. 
  Purchase of goods processed on commission in North Korea, 
mainly textile goods, skyrocketed 729 percent to 4,388,000 
dollars in nine cases last year. 
  In processing on commission, South Korean companies provide 
North Korean factories with raw materials and buy the finished 
products. 
  "North Korean technology to manufacture high-value added 
products, such as jackets and men's suits is very good, and the 
products are competitive on the Japanese market as well as on 
the domestic market," a Ministry official said. 
  Industrial goods accounted for 89.3 percent of the purchased 
North Korean goods, compared with 80.8 percent a year before, 
but the proportion of agricultural products decreased to 10.7 
percent from 19.2 percent in 1992. 
  Purchases of gold ingots, textiles, walnuts and alcoholic 
beverages increased, while those of cement, oriental medicines 
and fisheries products dropped.
