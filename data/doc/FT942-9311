FT  17 MAY 94 / Homes market brightens
The housing market recovery is continuing with a gentle but consistent rise
in prices, particularly in south-east England, a survey of more than 100
estate agents published today by the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors has found.
The survey says more than a fifth of agents in England and Wales have
reported a rise in prices during the three months to the end of April.
Static prices are reported by 74 per cent; and only 4 per cent report price
falls.
In south-east England 46 per cent of agents have reported price rises with a
similar proportion finding static prices, according to the institution. It
says that April's tax increases have so far made very little impact on the
housing market.
It says sales in the south-east have 'improved in a swathe of towns from
Berkhamsted to Windsor'. Sales in Sevenoaks, Kent, have reached the highest
level since the late 1980s while in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, they have
returned to the level of 1987.
Agents remain concerned that would-be sellers are still overpricing
properties, the institution says, adding that buyers remain very selective.
'There is a strong line . . . that overpriced houses are being ignored and
that there is a continued shortage of properties for sale,' it says.
