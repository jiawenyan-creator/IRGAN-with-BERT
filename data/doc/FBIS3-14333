  [Text] According to reports received from the south, the 
Israeli occupation forces have brought in 15 pieces of artillery 
across the al-Kharadli Bridge inside the border strip and 
deployed them south of the Balat township. 
  AFP cited sources in the port of Tyre as saying that the 
Israeli navy kidnapped seven Lebanese fishermen after firing on 
their boats inside Lebanon's territorial water. The sources 
added that the kidnappers towed the fishermen's boats to the 
port of Nahariyya.
