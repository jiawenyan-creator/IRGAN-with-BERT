SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
Police are looking for two men who robbed two banks in unrelated incidents 
Monday afternoon. 
Shortly after 1 p.m., a man walked into a Bank of America branch in the 700 
block of University Avenue in Hillcrest, said he had a gun and demanded some 
cash, said Bill Robinson, a spokesman for the San Diego Police Department. 
The robber fled from the bank with less than $500, Robinson said. 
Witnesses told police the robber was white, about 5-foot-5 and 120 pounds and 
in his 30s. He had a thin build, short straight blond hair and wore gold-rimmed 
glasses and a pink florescent baseball cap. Robinson said the same man is 
believed to have robbed at least two other banks in East San Diego. 
In the second incident, a man walked into the Home Federal Bank branch in the 
3900 block of 30th Street, said he had a gun and demanded money from a teller 
with a note that was stuffed inside a passbook-type folder. 
Robinson did not know how much money the man got away with, but police suspect 
he is responsible for 12 other bank robberies around San Diego totaling more 
than $10,000. 
The robber was described as Latino in his late 30s, with short, thick black 
hair, 5-foot-3 to 5-foot-10. The man was last seen heading south on 30th 
Street, Robinson said.
