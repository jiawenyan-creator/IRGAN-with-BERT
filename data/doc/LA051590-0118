BRIEFLY 
Playboy Dressing Up Its Stock: Playboy Enterprises will replace the image of a 
nude woman on its stock certificates with a clothed one in conjunction with a 
recapitalization plan unveiled last week. The change is expected to save the 
Chicago-based company about $100,000 annually, which is what it costs to 
service the accounts of about 14,000 single-share stockholders who bought the 
issue just to get the racy stock certificate.
