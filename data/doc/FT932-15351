FT  14 APR 93 / Survey of Leicestershire 6: Green initiatives sow growth
seeds - Leicester
IN THE late 1980s, when nearly every British town and city north of London
(and a good few south of it) were vigorously chasing new investment to
replace declining industries, little was heard from Leicester.
Leicester had its share of large company collapses arising from the
recession of the early 1980s, particularly in textiles and light
engineering. Now, apart from the utilities, no private sector company
employs more than a few hundred. But job losses never rose as steeply as in
nearby Coventry, or Corby. Throughout the decade unemployment did not exceed
the national average and was usually below the regional average.
Today, unemployment in the travel-to-work area of Leicester is 9.2 per cent
compared with a national average of 10.7 per cent. (As with most British
cities there are pockets of higher unemployment in deprived inner-city
areas.)
Leicester is unusual in not having attracted either an important government
office relocation or any significant white-collar or service company
investment in the last 10 years. Yet it has it has managed to contain
average unemployment. Moreover, despite the shakeout in large textile
companies, 36 per cent of the workforce is still employed in manufacturing.
The national average is 23 per cent.
The reason is the dramatic growth in Asian businesses. Ethnic minorities now
make up 28 per cent of the city's population; Indians from Uganda
predominate. The Asian business community has permeated many areas of
commercial life and is not confined to the corner store so familiar in many
cities. It is also involved in manufacturing, especially textiles.
Mr Imtiaz Farookhi, chief executive of Leicester City Council for the last
18 months, says: 'I do not know why Leicester did not try to attract new
outside investment in the past. It was before my time. Perhaps it believed
there was no need. Certainly the Asian business sector saved the city from
the worst ravages of recession.' Now, however, the city is trying to sell
itself.
It is not that the Asian sector is beginning to falter, although many
retailers are having a tougher time in the current recession than the last.
It is because of a realisation that there may be a limit to how far Asian
businesses can continue to trade up and add value. There is also an
acceptance that something extra will be needed to carry the city into the
late 1990s.
Ms Penny Baker, director of Leicester Promotions, says: 'There is a feeling
that Leicester has undersold and undervalued itself in the past. It seemed
overshadowed by places like Nottingham. The Inland Revenue relocated to
Nottingham and Nottingham almost captured English Heritage.' Leicester
Promotions, described as an 'arm's length' company by Ms Baker, has
representatives from private business,the public sector and local community
organisations. It is part of the new effort to market the city.
Leicester's profile was raised further in 1990 by being designated the UK's
first 'environment city'.
At last year's United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Leicester
Environment City was included among the world's 12 leading urban
initiatives. This award has, in turn, brought the city an EC award of Ecus
1.2m for environmental improvement campaigns.
The Leicester environment campaign involves more than 60 initiatives,
including the building of cycle tracks, paths to cut down on traffic
pollution, waste re-cycling, and energy conservation.
Mr Ian Roberts, director of Leicester Environment City, feels that a good
environmental image is important if Leicester wants to develop as a
post-industrial city and attract tourists and leisure industries.
He adds, however: 'It is not just a question of post industrial activity. We
run an advisory service. Given a constantly changing legislative background
it is important that companies know what is expected of them.'
Leicester's search for new investment has been hampered by a lack of
greenfield sites and by the shortage of modern B1 light industrial and
office space. The boundaries of the city are tightly drawn.
Existing B1 space is estimated at about 1m sq ft, but it is old and divided
into small units. A property of 50,000 sq ft would be deemed large.
Hopes are pinned on the 'City Challenge' area to attract new investment and
bring about inner city regeneration.
The area of 370 hectares (888 acres) which won a bid in the second round of
the government's city challenge programme last November is called Bede
Island. It is on the River Soar and close to the city centre.
The government has awarded Pounds 37.5m over five years. It is hoped that
this money will help to generate some Pounds 169m of private sector
investment and create 3,000 new jobs.
The key commercial developments will be a science park and other office and
and shopping units.
There are also plans to build a fashion museum. The reasoning here is that,
unlike other former industrial cities, Leicester does not have the normal
tourist draws like a beautiful cathedral. Nor has it developed attractions
based on its industrial past such as the museum of photography in Bradford,
the beer museum in Burton-on-Trent or the Albert Dock in Liverpool.
A fashion museum would emphasise Leicester's historical links with the
textile industry and tie in with De Montfort University, the former
polytechnic, which has more than 20,000 students and a campus close to the
proposed site. It has a strong tradition of fashion studies as well as
engineering and would be close to both the museum and the science park.
The city challenge scheme could be seen as another urban development
corporation. Development of B1 property and shops could have led to tensions
with the local population as occurred in the London Docklands or Bristol.
But Mr Keith Beaumont, the chief executive, who was once head of the
Sheffield UDC, says the situation here is different 'because the community
is actively involved. This is not developer-led - and anyway, some 13,500
people live in the area.'
More than a fifth of this population is aged 60 and over. About a quarter is
made up of ethnic minorities. A high proportion of students live in the
area. The unemployment rate is 13.6 per cent. Approximately two fifths of
households receive some form of benefit. About eight hectares is derelict
land, a quarter of the city's total.
Much discussion and planning has taken place to ensure that the social needs
of this deprived area will be addressed. As well as developing business
premises, there will be a lot of funds devoted to environmental improvements
and to social conditions. Some 900 houses will be improved and several
hundred new units built.
Mr Alistair Reid, the principal economic development officer at the city
council, sees the city challenge project as the spearhead of the attempt to
attract new investment to Leicester. Asked whether Leicester has missed the
boat now that government departments are not relocating from London as much
as in the 1980s, he says: 'You could say that. But there will be other
boats. Relocation out of the south-east will go on for years once the
economy picks up.'
