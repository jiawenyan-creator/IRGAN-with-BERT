MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . . 
A Senate committee on Tuesday approved a bill that would write into law the 
so-called "fairness doctrine" that the Federal Communications Commission 
repealed in 1987. The bill would require broadcasters to air opposing views on 
controversial issues. It is virtually identical to a measure passed by Congress 
in 1987 but vetoed by President Reagan. When the FCC overturned the fairness 
doctrine, it cited First Amendment concerns and said the rules were outdated. 
The doctrine came about in the 1940s on the premise that broadcasters should be 
required to be fair because only a few "voices" had access to public airwaves. 
But critics today contend there is no shortage of voices in this era of cable 
TV, satellites and VCRs. Broadcasters claim the doctrine exerts a "chilling 
effect" on discussions of controversial issues and is unconstitutional. But the 
bill's primary sponsor, Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), thinks the need for such 
legislation is greater than ever. He said there is evidence that broadcasters 
have been devoting less time to controversial issues since the FCC repealed the 
doctrine. The bill was sent to the full Senate on a voice vote by the Senate 
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. A companion measure was passed 
out of committee April 11 to the House, where it is awaiting floor action.
