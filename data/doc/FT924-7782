FT  14 NOV 92 / Attempted Peruvian coup fails
A SMALL group of retired officers, one of whom is linked to drug
trafficking, attempted to take over Peru's Government Palace and army
headquarters and assassinate President Alberto Fujimori early yesterday, the
palace said, Reuter reports from Lima.
The coup attempt, aimed at impeding upcoming congressional elections, was
put down and the officers have been detained, the palace said.
Mr Fujimori, who suspended constitutional rule in April with the backing of
the military, had to abandon Government Palace early yesterday after about
200 troops and several tanks took up positions outside the palace,
government sources said.
