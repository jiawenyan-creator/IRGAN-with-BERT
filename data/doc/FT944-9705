FT  15 NOV 94 / Milosevic puts more pressure on the media
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia is threatening to ban the last
independent newspaper in Belgrade, its editors said yesterday.
The move comes at a time when the Serbian economy appears in danger of
collapse and the president is facing criticism within his own party and the
country for his embargo against the Bosnian Serbs. But also it appears to
reflect his renewed confidence after being courted by the international
community as the man willing to make peace in Bosnia.
Last week, Mr Ivica Dacic, spokesman for Serbia's ruling socialists,
criticised Borba, the independent Belgrade daily, as an 'anti-state'
newspaper. Government lawyers invoked a legal technicality, saying the
newspaper was not legally registered, and therefore, does not exist. Borba's
editors dismissed this charge as 'nonsense', printing their three-year-old
registration petition.
Mr Branislav Milosevic, managing director of Borba, yesterday said the
Serbian president had a 'carte blanche to do whatever he likes in Serbia
after being hired as a peacemaker'.
Since imposing a political and economic embargo on the Bosnian Serbs three
months ago, the Serbian president has sacked the editor of Politika
television. The Politika daily newspaper, once the flagship of Serbian
journalism, has become a government mouthpiece. Studio B, the financially
strapped independent broadcaster, is also threatened by a
government-orchestrated takeover.
No relation to the president, Mr Milosevic of Borba says the move may be a
pre-emptive strike against potential dissent in Serbia. Economic
deprivations have risen. The Yugoslav dinar, stable for nearly a year, is
crumbling. Despite severe penalties, a black market has re-emerged.
Electricity has been restricted and shortages of staple foods are frequent.
Mr Milosevic may also come under increasing pressure to review his policy on
the Bosnian Serbs if they continue to suffer military setbacks.
