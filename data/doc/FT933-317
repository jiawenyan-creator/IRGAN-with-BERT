FT  29 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber pact calls for Dollars
60m boost
THE BUFFER stock manager of the International Natural Rubber Organisation
has made a MDollars 150m (Dollars 60m) cash call to organisation members to
finance a renewed effort to prop up natural rubber prices.
Members have 60 days to respond to the request.
With prices now 30 per cent lower in real terms than they were six years
ago, the buffer stock manager wants extra funds to buy in rubber from an
oversupplied world market. At present the Inro stockpile is about 200,000
tonnes.
Market analysts say that with producer and consumer countries locked in a
battle about the future of the international rubber trading system a
positive response to the cash call is by no means certain. The present
International Natural Rubber Agreement expires in three months. Producer
members want its terms renegotiated but the consumers want the present
agreement to continue.
A final decision on the future of Inra is likely to be made when Inro
council members meet here in November.
