FT  11 MAY 94 / Kohl to back land deal
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats are close to a
compromise agreement to allow former landowners in eastern Germany the right
to buy back some of their property in the five eastern states. The agreement
would end a bitter dispute within the CDU's ranks and pave the way for
investment and restructuring of agriculture in eastern Germany. Under the
terms of the compromise reached this week between eastern and western German
CDU parliamentary deputies, former landowners will be eligible to buy back,
at reduced price, some of their property. It is estimated that only 1,000 of
the 14,000 former owners will take advantage of this compromise. Until now,
the 1990 unification treaty had legally barred former owners whose property
was expropriated by the Soviet authorities between 1945 and 1949 from any
restitution or compensation. At the same time, the CDU is planning to
increase from about DM12bn to DM19bn a compensation fund for people whose
property was confiscated between 1933 and 1945 and between 1949 and 1990.
