FT  14 MAY 92 / Taiwan denies currency complaint
Taiwan's central bank governor Mr Samuel Shieh yesterday rejected US
allegations that it had manipulated the exchange rate to maintain export
competitiveness, writes Luisetta Mudie in Taipei.
The Taiwan dollar finished at a record high of 24.91 to the US dollar, as
dealers anticipated further US pressure to let the currency appreciate.
The local currency has been under strong upward pressure largely as a result
of the island's large trade surplus and high interest rates.
