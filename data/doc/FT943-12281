FT  26 JUL 94 / Observer: Portillo's petard
Does Observer detect a more than usual degree of smugness at the Treasury?
Before he left for pastures new, Michael Portillo drew up a detailed
assessment of the scope for cost savings around Whitehall. Wasteful and
inefficient use of resources at the Department of Employment was one of the
former chief secretary's gripes, and he highlighted the ministry's Pounds
3.5bn annual budget as a prime candidate for the scythe during the autumn
spending round. Now that the ultra-dry Portillo is getting a squint at that
supposed profligacy from the boss's seat, his first decision will be to drop
his predecessor's demand for extra funding and instead to oblige with
substantial cuts. Or, if not, his erstwhile colleagues will want to know
why.
