FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: New SE proposals are put on trial
The Stock Exchange yesterday staged a partial trial of new proposals
designed to alert investors when there is evidence that price-sensitive
information has been leaked, writes Paul Taylor.
The Exchange insisted that De La Rue and Portals' share prices on the Seaq
quotation system were 'indicative only' pending a joint company
announcement.
The move came after renewed speculation about a possible bid by De La Rue,
the banknote printer, for Portals, the security and specialist papermaker,
which sent shares soaring.
In their statement the two companies said that although they continued to
enjoy 'an exceptionally close commercial relationship' De La Rue had 'no
present intention of making an offer for Portals without the recommendation
of the Portals board'.
However the companies confirmed that, 'following on from continued
commercial contact between the two companies, De La Rue has recently
suggested to Portals that discussions on ways in which their co-operation
might be enhanced should include the possibility of De La Rue making an
offer for Portals'. The companies broke off merger talks in May when they
said they had been 'unable to reach agreement'.
It was the sharp rise in Portal's shares in May that prompted the Stock
Exchange to propose new measures to minimise the effects of insider trading
on investors' confidence in the market.
The Stock Exchange scheme, unveiled in October, was the brainchild of Mr
Michael Lawrence, the exchange's chief executive.
Under his proposals trading in individual companies' shares would be
suspended if there was evidence that price-sensitive information concerning
those companies has been leaked.
Consultations over the proposals have been completed, although the new rules
have yet to be implemented. Nevertheless yesterday's action, which
coincidently also involved Portals and De La Rue's shares, was seen as a
trial run. Portals' shares closed 66p higher at 771p.
