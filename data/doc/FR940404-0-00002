SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Order and Agreement No. 925 (7 CFR part 925) regulating the handling of table
grapes grown in a designated area of California. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 





The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, table grapes grown in California are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate
specified herein will be applicable to all assessable grapes handled during the 1994 fiscal year, which began January
1, 1994, through December 31, 1994. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies,
unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 



The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 



Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 



The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 



There are approximately 20 handlers of grapes subject to regulation under the marketing order each season. In addition,
there are approximately 90 producers of table grapes in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have been
defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000,
and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority
of these producers and handlers may be classified as small entities.
