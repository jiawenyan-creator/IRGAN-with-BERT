FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Most ITV shares too high say brokers
STOCKBROKERS Kleinwort Benson warned yesterday that shares of almost all the
ITV companies were 'dangerously high' and advised investors to take profits,
writes Raymond Snoddy.
The only exceptions were HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the west, and
Ulster Television, which were both judged to be cheap.
Kleinwort argues that uncertainty will continue while Mr Peter Brooke, the
National Heritage secretary, declines to state when he will make up his mind
on whether or not to relax ITV ownership rules.
In the absence of firm news, ITV shares, buoyed up by hopes of takeovers and
Granada's purchase of a 20 per cent stake in London Weekend Television,
would continue to drift back, the stockbrokers believe.
Kleinwort also argues that the economic case for allowing the nine largest
ITV companies to merge - something now forbidden by the 1990 Broadcasting
Act - was a weak one.
Larger ITV groupings would be more - rather than less - likely to attract
predators from continental Europe. The fact that 80 per cent of regional
programmes have to be produced locally restricted the cost savings that
could be taken out of the system.
'The Pounds 100m that has been claimed by Carlton as available to be taken
out of the cost base of ITV has yet to be substantiated: it is generally
believed to apply only if all 15 companies were to be merged into one,'
Kleinwort says.
