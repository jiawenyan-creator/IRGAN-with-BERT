FT  07 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Derivatives
The reaction in some quarters to high-profile losses from derivatives and
other leveraged financial instruments has been near-hysterical. There is a
danger that regulators will respond by throwing out the tried and tested
principle of caveat emptor. There is pressure to replace it with rules
requiring banks to establish whether a product is suitable for a particular
client before selling it. Fortunately, regulators have so far stepped back
from embracing this suitability criterion.
This week's agreement between Bankers Trust and the Federal Reserve goes
about as far as is sensible in regulating the relationship between banks and
their clients in this area. It requires the bank to ensure that its clients
have sufficient information to understand the risks they are assuming. The
final responsibility for judging whether products are suitable rests with
the clients, which is as things should be.
If there is a case for more action, it is in pushing the disclosure
principle further down the line. Companies and institutional investors could
disclose to their ultimate beneficiaries the risks they are assuming. If the
likes of Orange County and Procter &amp; Gamble had to reveal to taxpayers and
shareholders exactly what they were investing in, they might think more
carefully whether leveraged products really suited their needs.
