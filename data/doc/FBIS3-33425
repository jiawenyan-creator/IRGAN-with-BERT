  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] We would like to report on the 
situation nine hours after the National Federation of Public 
Employees Unions [Fenasep] entered the National Palace: 
  Diplomats, people who came on errands, and the building's 
staff were allowed to leave approximately 30 minutes ago. 
Inside the palace are the security forces, reporters from 
different local and foreign news media, 35 Fenasep union 
leaders, and representatives of the Office of the Human Rights 
Ombudsman and the Attorney General's Office, the judge on duty, 
and the fourth circuit judge who was accompanied by his 
secretary and two officials.
