  [Text] Baku is unhappy with mediators' aspiration to reach 
a ceasefire in the Karabakh conflict zone. Baku "openly spoke 
against bringing separating forces into the region, which is the 
backbone of Russia's peace plan," Acting Chairman of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Supreme Soviet Karen Baburyan told Interfax on 
April 14. 
  Therefore, he considers that it was not by chance that the 
start of a new offensive by the Azeri army in northern 
Nagorno-Karabakh and activation of peacekeeping efforts of the 
international community, and in the first place of Russia, 
"seeking the soonest end of bloodshed as the first step toward 
the beginning of talks" coincided. 
  In Baburyan's opinion, the prospect of Russia's military 
presence in the conflict zone alarmed the Azeri side which is 
aiming to disrupt a meeting between the warring sides at the 
highest level prepared with Russia's mediation.
