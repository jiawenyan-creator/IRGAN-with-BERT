FT  02 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: American dreams
The balloons and ticker tape which have greeted the better US economic news
of the last week may just be a little premature. True, the National
Association of Purchasing Managers' survey for November showed a distinct
improvement to 55 per cent yesterday and confidence is certainly up since
the election. But the revised figure of 3.9 per cent economic growth in the
third quarter owes much to rises in inventories, which have see-sawed
erratically over the past year. Equally, the change in sentiment greeting Mr
Clinton may not spark a charisma-led recovery any more than Mr Major's
triumph did in the UK.
Much of this year's fits-and-starts recovery has come from investment and
exports, while consumer spending has swung unpredictably. In part that may
be because savings are still low, so small bursts of additional spending are
the most that consumers can manage. That pattern is unlikely to change much
while unemployment continues to rise and, unfortunately, there is no real
sign that companies are hiring more staff. Indeed, the sharp rise in
information technology investment suggests they are finally reaping the
benefits of office automation.
While efficiency gains may help company earnings, economic growth may be
limited to 2 per cent in 1993, with the mooted fiscal boost from the
incoming administration adding another 0.5 per cent. Such an expansion would
be barely enough to maintain employment around current levels. Those looking
for straws in the wind might be encouraged that smaller companies are at
last reporting easier credit conditions. That may just provide an engine for
employment later next year.
