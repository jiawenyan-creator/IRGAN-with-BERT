  [Text] Moscow, March 31 (XINHUA) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu is expected to visit Moscow soon to 
prepare for a South Korean-Russian summit meeting, the ITAR-TASS 
NEWS AGENCY reported today. 
  The summit, probably scheduled for June between South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, is 
expected to focus on bilateral relations and the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula. 
  Han is currently visiting the United States and plans to fly 
to Moscow around April 10. 
  Although the announcement of Han's Moscow trip was announced 
suddenly by the South Korean president, Seoul says it is not 
connected in any way with the results of the Chinese-South 
Korean talks which ended Wednesday [30 March]. 
  The ITAR-TASS quoted Kim Yong-sam's associates as saying 
that 
Russia, the United States, Japan, China, are the four countries 
which Seoul considers important in the settlement of the nuclear 
problem. 
  Russia and South Korea have held numerous consultations at 
different diplomatic levels about the security problem on the 
Korean peninsula, but now it is time for their heads of state to 
discuss the problem, the ITAR-TASS said. 
  South Korea has refrained from supporting Moscow's idea of 
holding an international conference on the nuclear problem on 
the Korean peninsula with the participation of all the countries 
concerned, the news agency said.
