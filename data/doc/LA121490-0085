BRIEFLY 
Brokers Accused of Penny Stock Fraud: Federal regulators charged 10 New 
York-area brokers with bilking investors of about $1.4 million through 
fraudulent penny stock sales, in a case that names only the securities salesmen 
and not their firms. A civil lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court said the 
brokers conducted illegal trading at several firms using techniques that 
included pressuring investors to buy stock, refusing to let them sell and 
promising that prices would rise. The Securities and Exchange Commission 
complaint alleges that the brokers made more than $270,000 in commissions from 
60 defrauded customers and seeks recovery of all ill-gotten gains.
