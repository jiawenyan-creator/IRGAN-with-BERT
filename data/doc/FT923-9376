FT  05 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Edinburgh Oil tumbles to Pounds 5,000
Edinburgh Oil &amp; Gas, the USM-quoted oil and gas exploration and production
group, reported a drop in net profits from Pounds 234,000 to Pounds 5,000 in
the half year to June 30.
The result was in spite of an 18 per cent advance in turnover to Pounds
851,000 (Pounds 717,000) and was because of a higher depletion charge and
higher administration expenses due mainly to a lower level of activity on
the operated licences. Also, profits last time benefited significantly from
the sale of investments.
Earnings per share amounted to 0.02p (1.35p).
