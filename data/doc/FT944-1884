FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (High-Risk Investment): Trusts take the plunge
Investors are likely to have a choice of venture capital trusts as soon as
these high-risk funds come into existence next year, writes Bethan Hutton.
While full details of the rules governing them have not been published -
they will form part of the Finance Bill early in January - two fund
management groups have announced plans to go ahead.
The chancellor had barely sat down after last month's Budget before
Rothschild Asset Management said it would set up a venture capital trust,
specialising in the food industry, as soon as possible. Now, Glasgow-based
Murray Johnstone aims to establish a more general venture capital trust
within the first six months of next year.
Venture capital trusts will take stakes in very small companies, most of
which must have assets of less than Pounds 10m. Murray Johnstone aims to
reduce the cost of investing in such tiny companies by co-investing with
other venture capitalists.
Private investors are to be offered substantial tax breaks for investing in
the new funds at launch. These include 20 per cent up-front income tax
relief on investments of up to Pounds 100,000 a year, and tax-free income
and capital gains from the trust if shares are held for at least five years.
