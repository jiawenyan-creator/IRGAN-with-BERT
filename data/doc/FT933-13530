FT  19 JUL 93 / Comprehensives attacked over GCSE pass rate
'TOO MANY' pupils at comprehensive schools failed to pass any GCSEs last
year, says a report published today by a member of the team reviewing the
national curriculum in England and Wales.
A third of pupils obtained no GCSEs in at least one comprehensive in 20 per
cent of the local education authority areas in the country. A GCSE pass at
the lowest available level (grade G) is equivalent to a CSE grade five.
Dr John Marks, a leading rightwing theorist, used records of last year's
GCSE results as the basis of his study. In a third of local education
authority areas, he says, 10 times as many pupils achieved GCSE grades A to
C - equivalent to old-fashioned O-level passes - at the best school as at
the worst.
The research also suggests that the inspections planned next year by the
Office for Standards in Education, the government's new organisation for
school inspection, will miss most of the under-achieving schools. Of the 289
schools where more than three times the national average fail to pass any
GCSEs, only 30 will be inspected next year. About 6.7 per cent of pupils
failed to pass any GCSEs last year.
Differences between authorities were less marked, and tended to correlate
with levels of poverty. The six authorities where more pupils passed no
GCSEs than those who passed five to at least grade C were all in inner-city
areas.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers,
suggested that the disparities could be explained by catchment areas.
He said: 'If you look at the size of a local education authority,
communities within it can differ. Communities which speak English as a
second language will tend to send all their children to the same school
within one authority.'
