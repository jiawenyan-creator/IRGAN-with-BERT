ORANGE COUNTY PLASTICS FIRM TO BUILD TIJUANA PLANT 
Kyowa American Corp., the American subsidiary of a Tokyo-based firm that makes 
plastic cabinets for television sets, is the latest among an increasing number 
of Japanese companies to decide to manufacture at a Tijuana maquiladora. 
Kyowa American, based in Costa Mesa, has purchased an 8-acre tract in the 
Tecolotes section in Tijuana, administrator Terry Nagura confirmed in a 
telephone interview. Kyowa's plans call for construction to start on a 
100,000-square-foot building in April and for manufacturing to begin by 
November. 
Maquiladoras are foreign-operated plants where goods destined mainly for the U. 
S. market are manufactured or assembled with low-cost Mexican labor. 
"Labor costs in Mexico are one-tenth of what they are in America," Nagura said 
when asked the reasons for the move. Kyowa, however, will not lay off any of 
its 400 employees at two plants in Irvine and Costa Mesa once the Tijuana plant 
opens, she said. Instead, Kyowa will expand the line of products made in its 
Orange County plants. 
Kyowa American, a unit of Kyowa Electric &amp; Chemical, is an injection-mold 
plastics manufacturer whose clients include Sony, Hitachi and Mitsubishi 
television manufacturers. 
To supply its Japanese TV manufacturer customers in the United States, Kyowa 
has had operations here since 1973. Kyowa transferred its plant to Irvine from 
Atlanta in 1978, then opened another plant in Costa Mesa in 1986, Nagura said. 
Once the Tijuana plant is operating, Kyowa plans to begin making additional, 
smaller plastics products at its Orange County plants, including parts for 
typewriters, facsimile machines and household appliances, Nagura said.
