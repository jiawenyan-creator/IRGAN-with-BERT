FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Trafalgar House replaces BZW with UBS
Trafalgar House, the property, engineering and construction group, yesterday
replaced one of its brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities with UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew, writes Roland Rudd.
BZW are financial advisers and sole brokers to Midland &amp; Scottish Resources
who have been in dispute with Trafalgar concerning the Emerald Producer
offshore rig for almost a year.
Sir Eric Parker, Trafalgar's chief executive, said that since BZW had a
potential conflict of interest it had been agreed that the change would be
in the best interests of both parties.
Trafalgar directors claim they were told by BZW before the bid closed for
Davy that there was nothing wrong with the company.
In a separate development RTZ, the mining group, has appointed Cazenove as
joint broker.
