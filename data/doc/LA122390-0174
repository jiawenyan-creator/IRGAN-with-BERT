CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SONORA; 
HISTORIC CAVE ADDED TO NATIONAL PARK 
Stanislaus National Forest has completed acquisition of Bower Cave, which 
historians say was known to Indians hundreds of years ago. 
The deal involved a land exchange with Fibreboard Corp. under which the Park 
Service obtained the 855-acre Linkletter Ranch, including the historic cave. 
Miwok Indians called the Mariposa County cave Oo-tin, meaning Home of the early 
Star and in the 1870s gold miners used the cave as a dance hall. Forest Service 
officials said access to the cave will be restricted because of potential 
hazards.
