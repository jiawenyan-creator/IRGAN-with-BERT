FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Amstrad looks to the east for satellite
growth
Amstrad is hoping to lift sales of its satellite receiving equipment in the
Asia Pacific and Middle East regions following a distribution agreement with
Pan Asian Systems, a subsidiary of Hutchison Whampoa.
Nearly a third of Amstrad's turnover comes from satellite equipment.
Hutchison is one of the largest distributors of satellite receiving
equipment in the two regions.
Amstrad will market its equipment as able to receive broadcasts from Star
TV, the Hong Kong-based satellite television broadcaster, in which a 63.6
per cent stake was acquired last week by News International.
