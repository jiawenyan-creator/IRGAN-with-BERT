BELLFLOWER COUNCIL OKS STREET BARRIER TO CURB DRUG TRAFFICKING 
The City Council has approved installing a temporary traffic barrier in an 
effort to curb drug trafficking in a Bellflower neighborhood. 
The council voted unanimously to place orange traffic cones at the intersection 
of Eucalyptus Avenue and Alondra Boulevard to prevent cars traveling on Alondra 
from turning south at Eucalyptus. 
Eucalyptus south of Alondra will still be accessible from Flora Vista Street. 
Although neighbors have said they would like to see the street barricaded 
completely, Mayor John Ansdell said merchants in a nearby shopping center would 
suffer if the street were closed. 
Residents have argued that anyone who breaks the law to sell drugs would not be 
afraid to drive through the barrier on Eucalyptus. 
Ansdell said Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies will strictly enforce the 
new traffic regulation. 
"This is just a temporary measure to see if we can stop the drug trafficking," 
Ansdell said. "It's a start."
