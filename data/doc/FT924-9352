FT  06 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts surge on relief at Maastricht vote
UK government bonds surged yesterday, gaining more than a point at the long
end on relief at the government's narrow victory in Wednesday night's
Maastricht debate and hopes of a cut in interest rates.
In spite of the government's narrow majority, the gilt market rallied
strongly, reversing the losses seen in the days ahead of the Maastricht
debate.
Dealers noted strong demand from overseas buyers.
The Liffe gilt future rallied from 100.10 to 101.16, although volume in the
contract was relatively low at just over 25,000 contracts.
In the cash market, the 9 per cent gilt due 2008 rallied from its opening of
102 5/32 to 103 7/16 by late afternoon.
At the short end, the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 rose from 105 9/32 to 105
7/16 .
THE German yield curve steepened further yesterday as dealers reported
strong demand for medium-dated issues.
On the DTB, the December Bobl future rose to 95.97 from 95.81, reflecting
the demand for medium-dated notes.
Dealers said that some European central banks - which have succeeded in
replenishing their reserves following the September currency crisis - have
started to buy medium-dated notes again.
However, long-dated bunds were little changed on the day, with the Liffe
December Bund futures contract trading at 91.33, down 0.02 points from
Wednesday's close.
Elsewhere in Europe, short-dated French government bonds rose on hopes of
further interest rate cuts.
The long end of the market closed little changed after yesterday's auction
of OATs.
The French Treasury sold FFr10bn of 8 1/2 per cent bonds due 2003, and
FFr4.5 bn of 8 1/2 per cent bonds, due 2008.
Demand for the issues was 'reasonably healthy', according to one dealer.
The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2003 ended at 8.10 per cent against
an opening of 8.09 per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds ended slightly weaker on profit-taking, with the
December futures contract slipping from 107.52 to close at 107.46.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 JGB moved in a range of 4.685-4.71 per
cent, and ended Tokyo trading at 4.7 per cent. The Finance Ministry offered
Y300bn of 20-year bonds at auction with a coupon of 5.7 per cent, up from
5.6 per cent for the previous issue. The average yield at the auction was
5.7 per cent.
AFTER an unexpected fall in jobless claims, US Treasury prices see-sawed in
light trading yesterday as dealers and investors awaited this morning's
important employment data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  5/32 at 94
27/32 , yielding 7.686 per cent. The two-year note was slightly firmer, up
1/32 at 99 23/32 , yielding 4.383 per cent.
Prices, especially at the long end, fell in early trading after the Labor
Department announced that initial claims for state unemployment insurance
fell 16,000 in the week ending October 24. The drop was bigger than
expected, and left the market even more uncertain about today's employment
report for October.
After recovering around midday, Treasuries fell back later in the afternoon
as players positioned themselves for this morning's employment news.
