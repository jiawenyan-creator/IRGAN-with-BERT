FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Saga advances 10% in first eight
months
SAGA Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company, yesterday
announced a 10 per cent increase in 1993 eight-month interim net profits to
NKr296m (Dollars 40.5m) from NKr269m in the same period last year. It was
helped by increased petroleum production, higher oil prices and lower
exploration costs.
The result was marred by an unrealised currency loss of NKr282m on long-term
dollar denominated debt.
Revenue in the period rose to NKr4.02bn from NKr3.350bn as operating costs
increased to NKr2.79bn from NKr2.51bn. Operating profit rose to NKr1.23bn
from NKr843.
Production of oil, gas and condensate rose to 3.5m tonnes of oil equivalent,
of which oil accounted for 90.1 per cent.
