FACES: ROKER: NOT ABOUT GLAMOUR 
Roxie Roker, glamour-puss, is nowhere to be found. 
"It's not about glamour," says the statuesque actress of her stage role in 
Samm-Art Williams' "Woman From the Town" at Inner City Cultural Center. "It's 
not about vanity. And I rather welcome it." Roker, who played the very chic 
Helen Willis for 11 seasons on "The Jeffersons," is here a worn-out, worn-down 
Southern farmer who clomps around in overalls, mud boots and bandanna -- with 
not a speck of makeup, tirelessly plowing her late father's fields. 
"I have to get up for the play," she says of the anger-filled, emotionally 
demanding role. "When I finish it, I feel -- cleansed is not the word. You 
start out saying, 'Why do I put myself through this?' But when you decide this 
is what you want to do, you just do it. So any opportunity I get, I want to do. 
I'm from New York; we do a lot of off-Broadway. We like making plays. Not that 
we don't want to be successful and make big bucks, but. . . ." 
After an early acting start at her all-girls school ("I played the male roles 
because I was tall and had a deep voice"), Roker went on to a drama degree from 
Howard University, Elizabethan studies at Stratford-on-Avon and stage roles in 
"The Blacks," "Jamimma," and "The River Niger" -- for which she won an Obie. 
But the actress' biggest fame of late has been her family ties: as mother to 
up-and-coming musician Lenny Kravitz, mother-in-law to famous Cosby kid Lisa 
Bonet and grandmother to their year-old daughter Zoe. "I know how to separate 
my personal and professional lives," she says lightly. "And keeping (the fame) 
in the family is fine. Zoe is gorgeous, precious, just a joy. Lenny is 
thoughtful and considerate, Lisa is a wonderful mother. Forget about all that 
stuff you read in the papers." JANICE ARKATOV
