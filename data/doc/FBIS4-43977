  [Text] Nothing new was discussed at tonight's meeting 
between President Glavkos Kliridhis and Joe Clark, the UN 
secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, at the 
Presidential Palace. 
  In a statement after the meeting, government spokesman 
Ioannis Kasoulidhis said an interesting discussion was held and 
Clark surely understood the Greek Cypriot side's positions. The 
spokesman said he believes the goal of Clark's visit is to help 
the UN Security Council formulate its decisions. The Security 
Council will discuss the UN secretary general's report. He 
said: We discussed nothing other than the 21 March document and 
we explained the reasons we do not agree with a continuation of 
the procedure.
