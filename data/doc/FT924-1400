FT  18 DEC 92 / Top-quality research 'is scarce'
MOST top-quality research is concentrated in barely a dozen of Britain's
universities, assessments by the Universities Funding Council indicated
yesterday.
The assessments, which give a ranking to every university research centre in
the country, show that fewer than 50 of Britain's 130 universities, colleges
and university institutes have two or more centres judged to be conducting
research of international standing.
Of the 344 centres judged to be at that level nearly a third are in just
four institutions: Cambridge University, Oxford University, University
College, London, and Imperial College, London.
The former polytechnics scored poorly in the exercise, which they have
entered for the first time since joining the university sector. This caused
little surprise given their lack of research funding and their status as
teaching institutions.
But a number of older universities are in the same position. Five, including
Aston and Bangor, have no department of international standing and a further
eight, including Salford, Aberdeen and Dundee, have only one.
The assessments, the first since 1989, are crucial to universities as they
are used by the council to allocate research funding, which was worth Pounds
860m in 1990.
Each university research centre is ranked on a one-to-five scale. Next
year's research funding will be linked to the new rankings with funding
concentrated on departments achieving the higher four rankings, especially
on those with the highest rankings.
The council said its survey was based on 'rigorous' assessment of the output
of more than 43,000 academics by 450 of their colleagues and some outside
assessors.
Professor Graeme Davies, chief executive of the council, said: 'The ratings
have been decided by academic staff and others who are all experts in their
subjects. The judgments are theirs. The role of the UFC was to manage the
exercise and ensure it was conducted fairly and consistently according to
clear guidelines.'
The Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals welcomed the evidence that
'old' universities had improved research quality since a similar exercise in
1989. Dr David Harrison, the committee chairman, said that against the
backdrop of rising student numbers it represented 'a remarkable tribute to
our dedicated and underpaid staff'.
Mr John Stoddart, vice-chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, a former
polytechnic, said the assessment would lead to 'a very substantial increase'
in state funding for the new universities, even though only one,
Westminster, achieved a top grade - and even that institution obtained only
one.
The success of many in achieving mid-ranking scores for some departments
will open up new funding opportunities for them.
The assessment shows research quality to be unevenly distributed. In
history, 82 centres were assessed, and only five were judged to be of
international standing. In anatomy 18 centres yielded four of international
standing. In nursing none of the 29 centres assessed were found to be at
that level.
The top-scoring institutions in business and management studies were the
universities of Bradford, Warwick, Lancaster and Strathclyde, the London
Business School, the London School of Economics and UMIST in Manchester.
The survey is the third to be conducted. Previous assessments covering the
work of all academic staff in institutions were carried out in 1986 and
1989. This year's assessment required institutions to put forward only those
staff they judged to be 'active' in research.
Institutions were invited to submit up to two publications and up to two
other forms of public output for each 'active' staff member. The panels of
assessors also took into account research grant and contract income, total
numbers of publications and numbers of research students.
The council has yet to assess teaching quality in the way it has judged
research. The new Higher Education Funding Council, to succeed the UFC in
April, has been charged by the government with developing a quality
assessment framework for university teaching.
