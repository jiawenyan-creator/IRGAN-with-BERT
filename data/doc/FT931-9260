FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: Decision day for Shaw rebels
REBEL SHAREHOLDERS at Arthur Shaw, the loss-making West Midlands building
materials group, will today try to unseat the company's embattled chairman,
Mr Gordon Pearson, and take control of the board.
The rebels are led by Mr Ian Tickler, Mr Pearson's predecessor, whose family
founded the company in 1909 and was chairman when it joined the USM in 1988.
The Tickler family still controls a 13.4 per cent equity stake in the name
of Grange Nominees, against Mr Pearson's 15 per cent.
The dissidents requisitioned today's extraordinary meeting to propose Mr
Pearson's removal from the board and the reappointment of Mr Tickler. They
are also calling for the reappointment of Mr Donald Crammond, who was ousted
from the board at the annual meeting last August.
According to Granville, the stockbroker advising the Tickler family,
shareholders representing more than 49 per cent of the company's equity are
supporting the move. They claim their campaign has been strengthened by a
division on the board which emerged after Mr Alan Bearman, a non-executive
director and former finance director, issued a statement disassociating
himself from a letter sent to shareholders by Mr Pearson.
Dissident shareholders have expressed concern over the management and recent
performance of the company, and fears that the business is losing direction.
They claim that the group's high level of gearing and deteriorating
performance are mainly attributable to the costs of acquiring the Jackdaw
engineering tools group in 1990.
