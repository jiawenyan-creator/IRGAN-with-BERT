FT  23 DEC 94 / Arts: Today's Television
There is always one witty person in Have I Got News for You? Paul Merton is,
unlike his colleagues, genuinely quick, funny, intelligent and not dependent
on snideness, malice, implied superiority or retarded infantilism.
Tonight's edition (10pm BBC2) is the last of the series; time to take stock.
Is Angus Deayton really such a one-joke man, that joke being his air of prim
supercilious (which does not rule out schoolboy smut)? Has Ian Hislop really
nothing more to him than the tacky raffishness of a middle-aged imp with the
charisma of a gargoyle carved from a potato? His air of gleeful
naughty-child mischief verges on the grotesque. This has turned into a cosy
little club, inimical to real satire and reeking dangerously of
irresponsible self-satisfaction. Which sitting duck shall they put the boot
into tonight? Which personal and private feud will they generously share
with us? One of the guests is Kelvin Mackenzie, ex-editor of The Sun. They
probably feel superior to him but are brothers under the skin; he is merely
more honest. A grubbily smirking little programme.
