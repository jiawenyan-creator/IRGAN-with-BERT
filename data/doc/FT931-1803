FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Galeries Lafayette shrugs off
retail sector problems
GALERIES Lafayette, the French department store, managed to stay in the
black last year despite the sluggish state of the French retail sector and
the problems of its recently-opened New York store.
The group, which made net profits of FFr300.8m (Dollars 54m) in 1991,
refused to comment on the exact level of profits last year before its
financial results are published in late April. However, it stayed in profit
last year in spite of a fall in turnover to FFr31.9bn from FFr33bn in 1991.
Galeries Lafayette was also hit by the cost of opening its store on Fifth
Avenue in Manhattan. It has made provisions on the cost of the New York
venture, which it said would be 'substantial'.
Another difficulty has been the cost of financing the group's FFr2.87bn bid
for the Nouvelles Galeries chain. Galeries Lafayette made a partial
FFr2.15bn bid in 1991 for a 72.5 per cent stake in Nouvelles Galeries, but
last year bid FFr718m for the remaining shares.
The strains on Galeries Lafayette last year demonstrate the general
pressures within French retailing, and the turbulence within the department
stores sector, which has been destabilised by a series of deals including
the Pinault group's takeover of the Au Printemps chain. Galeries Lafayette
has recently been cited as a potential purchaser for Prisunic, the general
stores owned by Pinault.
