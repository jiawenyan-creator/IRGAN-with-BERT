FT  01 AUG 92 / Letter: No better than a pint
Nigel Andrews' article on Burgandy ('Burgundy, only the real thing will do',
July 25) was delicious and most welcome, but how can he propose that boeuf a
la Bourguignonne should be washed down with '. . . a good bottle of St
Emilion'?
What of Pommard? What of Morgon, Corton, Vosne Romanee, Richebourg?
Mr Andrews might as well propose a pint of mild with jellied eels.
