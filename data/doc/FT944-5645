FT  02 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Grand Metropolitan
There was nothing sinister about the revelation that Grand Metropolitan
earned Pounds 64m in operating profits from the sale of Burger King
restaurants to franchisees last year. But the figure was higher than
expected and arguably should have been taken below the line as the profits
did not arise from normal trading. It raised a question-mark about the
quality of the group's profits from food - otherwise one of the highlights
of yesterday's figures.
Strong cash-flow was another plus point, but this was outweighed by the poor
performance from drinks. Here, operating profits dropped 8 per cent overall,
with a fall of 4 per cent in the US. Special factors, such as a major
destocking, help explain this. But the data underscored just how difficult
conditions are in the international drinks markets. The pick-up in the US
economy has not led to any corresponding increase in prices. They rose by a
modest 1 per cent worldwide, denying the group the benefits of
inflation-driven operational gearing. High marketing expenditure could not
fend off the pricing pressure. The group plans to step up its marketing
expenditure but so great are the competitive pressures that this cannot be
expected to trigger a surge in prices.
Under the circumstances, GrandMet's lowly rating compared to Allied Domecq
or Guinness is not a compelling argument for buying GrandMet's shares. A
narrowing of the differential is as likely to come from a de-rating of the
other companies' shares as from a revaluation of GrandMet.
