  [Excerpts] Hamburg (DPA) -- The criticism of Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) and his plans 
to reduce the Bundeswehr to 340,000 [figure as published] men is 
continuing. [passage omitted] 
  The Bundeswehr Association has meanwhile defended Ruehe. 
"Anyone who continues to speak about a troop strength of 
370,000 men without saying at the same time where the additional 
billions are supposed to come from is simply incredible from the 
soldiers' viewpoint," Bundeswehr Association Chairman Bernhard 
Gertz said on Hesse Radio on Wednesday [20 April]. A reduction 
of the Bundeswehr to 340,000 soldiers does not call fairness for 
military service into question. Because of the saving of 1.25 
billion marks, which is necessary on short notice, Ruehe does 
not have any other choice. His concept is the most sensible 
solution, Gertz said. 
  Free Democratic Party Bundestag Deputy Olaf Feldmann came 
out 
in favor of suspending compulsory military service and 
establishing a professional army. The international tasks which 
Germany will be facing require this, he said on Deutschlandfunk 
Radio. Before the Bundeswehr is reduced, its tasks must be 
clearly defined. [passage omitted] 
  Former Fleet Admiral Elmar Schmaehling has noted that 
further 
Bundeswehr missions abroad would logically lead to a 
professional army. "In order to establish crisis reaction 
forces, new volunteers would have to be recruited, who are fully 
supporting the new task." However, in an interview with 
LUEBECKER NACHRICHTEN Schmaehling criticized the "fixation on 
military operations." [passage omitted]
