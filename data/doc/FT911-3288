FT  25 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
STOCK index futures slipped lower yesterday on fears of a major rights issue
and nervousness ahead of the ICI quarterly results due today.
For most of the session, the June FT-SE 100 index traded below the level
which brokers calculate is necessary to take account of future dividend
payments and financing cost.
The June FT-SE closed at 2,514, down 13 points on the day but just 27 points
above the spot index, compared with brokers' estimate of a 30-point fair
value premium.
During the early part of the session, the futures market provided some
support to the underlying market. Later in the day, the fears of a rights
issue unnerved dealers and prices were marked lower.
In the traded options market, Hoare Govett announced it had withdrawn from
market making. At its peak, Hoare had more than 12 marketmakers but
yesterday just three were left to be made redundant. Hoare will continue to
broke options to institutions.
Overall turnover on the options market remained depressed, with just 24,499
contracts traded, barely changed on the day and below the level necessary
for the market to cover its costs.
Marks and Spencer was the busiest option, 1,506 changing hands as the shares
receded. GrandMet traded 1,449 and British Airways 1,248.
