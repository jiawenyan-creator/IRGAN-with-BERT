FT  14 SEP 92 / International Company News: Danish group to acquire Macfish
for about Pounds 18m
FOODMARK A/S, the Danish seafoods group, has agreed to pay more than Pounds
18m for Macfish, the Scottish fish processing venture jointly owned by Geest
and Associated Fisheries.
The sale follows Geest's decision in March to seek a buyer for its 50 per
cent stake in the company, based in Fraserburgh and Wearside. Associated
Fisheries announced a similar plan in April following Macfish's mounting
losses which last year exceeded Pounds 800,000 on a turnover of Pounds
46.5m.
The Danish group has agreed to pay Geest Pounds 9.2m and Associated
Fisheries Pounds 9.16m for the business, stock and fixed assets of the
frozen fish business.
Geest said funds raised by the sale would be reinvested in its core fresh
produce business, while Associated Fisheries said it planned to use the
money to reduce short-term borrowings and finance future investments.
Geest and Associated Fisheries expect the deal and a further sale of Pounds
2m of Macfish assets to cover the estimated value of their original
investments in the Scottish company.
Geest said yesterday that over-capacity in fish processing and inadequate
supplies of fish, which had pushed prices up and demand down, led to the
decision to sell.
Foodmark, like Macfish, is already a large own label supplier to groups
including Marks and Spencer.
