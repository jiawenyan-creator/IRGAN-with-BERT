  [Text] Journalist Carlos Sanabria Marrero has informed the 
National Radio Newscast that Esteban Lazo Hernandez, first 
secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in Santiago de Cuba, 
has held a news conference during which he talked about the main 
work objectives for 1994 in Santiago de Cuba Province. 
  [Begin Lazo recording] We are going to begin work at the 
refinery, which will take some time. It is going to be working 
in 1994. We are going to work out an agreement with the textile 
plant. We also are going to work hard at the El Cobre mine. 
There are sufficient resources in (Retome) to work this year, 
with the exception of (?trucks). Practically all the SIME 
[Ministry of the Steelworking Industry] enterprises are going to 
be able to work at full capacity on producing bicycles and other 
things. Practically all the Basic Industries plants are going to 
be working. Light Industry will have certain limitations. 
Practically all the Food Industry factories will be working. 
Thus, 1994 is a year for working. And I reiterate: It will be a 
hard year, a difficult year, but a year that, given the 
experiences of 1993, can be better, if we all work, if we all 
struggle. [end recording]
