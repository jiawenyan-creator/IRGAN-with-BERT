SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: DEL MAR 
A request for a change of venue in the trial of a man suspected of battering, 
molesting and abandoning twin boys at a Del Mar hotel was denied Monday. 
Nancy Rosenfeld, the attorney for Charles McCoy, 28, of Oceanside, requested 
that McCoy's trial be moved to another county because of pretrial publicity. 
San Diego Superior Court Judge Michael Wellington denied the motion, saying it 
was not necessary to have the trial transferred in order for McCoy to receive a 
fair trial. 
The twin boys, now 3 years old, were found bruised, crying and wandering the 
halls of the Del Mar Inn in their underwear March 25. McCoy, who is charged 
with child abuse, is believed to have checked in with them under another name, 
but checked out and left them there. 
His girlfriend and the boys' mother, Dorothy DeSimone, 26, of Oceanside, 
pleaded guilty May 9 to child endangerment and was sentenced July 5 to one year 
in jail and five years probation. 
DeSimone testified against McCoy at his preliminary hearing in July. 
Also on Monday, McCoy received a new trial date of Nov. 30.
