venture
Reuters, the information and media group, yesterday announced that it was
forming a joint venture with a farmers' co-operative in the US to market
commodity information to North American commodity businesses.
The venture, which will be based in Kansas City, will bring together Reuters
America and Farmland Industries, one of the biggest farmer-owned
agricultural marketing and manufacturing co-operatives in the US, Reuters
said.
The 50-50 venture will be called Market Communications Group, offering price
quotations and analysis of commodity news, weather and markets, primarily by
satellite.
Reuters has been taking advantage of the sharp price rises for many
commodities this year, expanding editorial coverage in Asia, Europe, Africa
and the Americas.
