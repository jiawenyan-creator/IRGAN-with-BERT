WOODLAND HILLS ASTROS WIN TOURNAMENT GAME 
UCLA players Adam Schulhofer and David Tokheim had two hits each as the 
Woodland Hills Astros defeated a team representing Mexico, 12-2, Saturday to 
advance to the third round of the U.S. Open Baseball tournament at Galvin Field 
in Ontario. 
The game was stopped after five innings because of the 10-run rule. 
Schulhofer had a double and a home run and Tokheim drove in two runs with a 
pair of singles. The Astros will play a Las Vegas team today at noon.
