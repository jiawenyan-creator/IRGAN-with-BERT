FT  30 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Freedom's limits
Mr Norman Lamont may have been moved to sing in his bath by the policy
freedom conferred on Britain by devaluation. Yesterday's clutch of economic
data suggests that freedom may be illusory. The savings rate remains
depressingly high, while foreign investors were selling gilts hand over fist
as pressure on sterling mounted in August.
The drop in the savings ratio to 10.3 per cent from 11 between the first and
second quarters seems initially encouraging. But if the first quarter was
distorted upwards by bonus payments ahead of the election, the second
quarter was certainly distorted downwards for the same reason. The
underlying trend still points to consumer debt aversion. Sears and
Kingfisher have just reminded us there is no sign of a revival in consumer
demand. That must wait until the housing market recovers, which, in turn
requires yet lower interest rates.
How overseas investors might react to an even weaker pound is another
matter. They bought Pounds 6.3bn in gilts in the year to July and sold
Pounds 1.3bn in August. So they still have plenty left to sell. True, there
is no immediate funding need, but that will not last. Before the government
went into surplus in the late 1980s, gilts investors generally required a
premium of more than 3 percentage points over German bond yields. It is now
just 1.6 points.
Since sluggish world growth will keep export markets weak, recovery still
has to be consumer-led to some degree. One tactic could be to cut interest
rates sharply now. The authorities would have to hope sterling had
stabilised and recovery was in place by the time funding had to resume in
any quantity. But that would be a gamble to say the least. It will take luck
and a measure of courage bordering on the reckless to generate much growth
out of the new environment.
