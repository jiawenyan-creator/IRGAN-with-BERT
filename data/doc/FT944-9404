FT  16 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Malaysian concerns - Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation
In an unpublished memorandum circulated in Jakarta last night, Malaysia said
it would 'only commit to undertaking further liberalisation on a unilateral
basis at a pace and capacity commensurate with our level of development'. It
said Apec liberalisation should 'not create an exclusive free trade area in
Asia Pacific'. Liberalisation must be consistent with the Gatt and WTO and
'on an unconditional MFN (Most Favoured Nation) basis'.
It said the target dates of 2020 and 2010 for Apec liberalisation were
'indicative and non-binding,' and liberalisation should be 'undertaken on a
best endeavour basis' consistent with countries' level of economic
development. Liberalisation should 'only cover a substantial proportion of
Asia Pacific trade and should not go beyond the provisions of Gatt and WTO'.
Referring to the provision in the statement allowing countries to join Apec
liberalisation at a later stage, Malaysia said 'decisions in Apec should be
taken on the basis of consensus'.
