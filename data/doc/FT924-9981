FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: New chief at Alexander Proudfoot
Alexander Proudfoot, the US-based but UK-quoted management consultant which
has been overshadowed this year by sharp falls in profits and its share
price, yesterday appointed a new group chief executive.
Mr John Prosser, formerly managing director for Europe, will fill a role
left vacant since the resignation in July of Mr Thomas Huhn. Since then, the
company has been managed by a management committee, reporting to Lord
Stevens, the chairman.
Yesterday's appointment, which returns the company to a traditional
management structure, partly reflects the poor reception among Proudfoot's
institutional shareholders of management by committee.
Meanwhile Mr Alan Steelman, chief operating officer under the committee, has
resigned.
Proudfoot's shares have fallen from 400p to 75p this year on uncertainty
about the company's trading outlook, embarrassing provisions to cover unpaid
tax bills, and confusion about the company's leadership.
Mr Prosser said Lord Stevens would stay on as chairman, despite the sale
earlier this year by Invesco MIM of its remaining stake in Proudfoot. 'Lord
Stevens is a very effective chairman,' Mr Prosser said.
