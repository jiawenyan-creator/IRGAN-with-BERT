BRIEFLY 
Infant Pillow Recall: Six manufacturers have agreed to immediately recall more 
than 600,000 infant pillows linked to the suffocation deaths of 19 infants, the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission said. The pillows are dangerous because they 
can conform to a baby's face, causing suffocation in infants unable to roll 
over, commission staffers said. Recalled are: 467,000 "Mothers Helper" cushions 
made by Hollander Home Fashions, Newark, N.J.; 110,000 "Gold Bug Support 
Sacks," Gold Inc., Denver; 35,700 "Cozy Cushions," Pinky Baby Products, 
Houston; 12,000 "Cozy Baby" pillows, Cozy Baby Products, Mount Vernon, N.Y.; 
3,000 "Baby Minder" cushions, Fourth Little Pig, San Anselmo, Calif., and 125 
"Baby Sak" pillows, Baby Sak, Pembroke Pines, Fla.
