<F P=106> [Report by Tim Coone: "Dublin Pressed To Give Backing for </F>
Sutherland"] 
  [Text] Dublin -- The Irish government is coming under 
growing opposition pressure at home to give its backing to Mr 
Peter Sutherland, outgoing director-general of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, as a compromise candidate to 
succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European 
Commission. 
  Mr John Bruton, leader of the opposition Fine Gael party, is 
to table [present] an emergency motion in parliament today in an 
effort to force the government's hand on the issue. 
  "There has to be a way of re-engaging Britain with Europe," 
Mr Bruton said yesterday. ``This is Europe's biggest problem 
now. If Britain moves further away from Europe, Ireland stands 
to lose the most because of our trade dependence. Peter 
Sutherland is someone who can bridge that gap. 
  ``He is a committed European but one who can speak to the 
British in terms which does not provoke their prejudices.'' 
  Mr Sutherland was a former attorney-general in a Fine 
Gael-led government in the 1980s, and a former EU [European 
Union] competition commissioner. He would have to be a 
commissioner to be eligible for the presidency post and the 
present Fianna Fail-Labour coalition government has insisted 
that it has no intention of replacing Mr Padraig Flynn, 
Ireland's commissioner, who holds the Social Affairs portfolio 
in Brussels. 
  Ms Mary Harney, leader of the opposition Progressive 
Democrats party, which is also backing Mr Sutherland, said 
yesterday: "There is no country blocking Mr Sutherland except 
his own. There is nobody against him except the Irish 
government, which is a crazy situation."
