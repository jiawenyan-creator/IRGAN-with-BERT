FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Simpsons shows flat second half
SIMPSONS of Cornhill, owner of the famous City chop house, yesterday
announced a small profit following a year marked by a bitter struggle for
control of the company.
The Nottingham-based group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 80,000 in the 53
weeks to July 4.
Hopes of better results were undermined by flat demand in the second half
following interim profits of Pounds 88,000 in the six months to December 31.
Mr Paul Reece, managing director, said the profit on a turnover of Pounds
1.53m would undermine moves by a group of dissident shareholders to unseat
the board.
The dissidents - led by Mr Robert Klapp, former chairman of Select
Appointments - feared the company had abandoned its strategy of opening
themed chop house restaurants. They failed, however, to get two directors
elected at an extraordinary meeting in August.
Mr Klapp, who claims the backing of more than 30 per cent of the
shareholders, is now seeking another EGM to oust the existing management
team.
Simpsons, which came to the USM in August 1991, plans to publish its
accounts later this week and Mr Reece predicted they would confound rebel
claims that the opening this year of two London bistros - Dell'Ugo and Palio
 -had incurred large losses. 'We hope the accounts will defuse the rebel
moves,' he added.
As regards a dividend, the directors have decided to conserve cash resources
this time but will consider a payment in the current year.
