FT  17 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Heron sales should raise Pounds 90m
HERON International expects to raise Pounds 90m in two property disposals to
be formally announced next month.
It is understood the vehicle for Mr Gerald Ronson's property and trading
activities has agreed the deals, one in Britain and one in continental
Europe, but is not yet ready to make a formal announcement. Sales are
thought to be at much higher yields than the current norm.
The company may find the deals a useful response to the controversy over Mr
Ronson's salary package revealed in documents setting out the planned Pounds
1.4bn restructuring. They will go some way to improving the pro forma net
asset value shown at Pounds 12m.
Mr Ronson's Pounds 500,000 a year index-linked salary and five-year contract
raised eyebrows when it was revealed in documents covering the restructuring
which is due to be completed by July 1, subject to creditors' approval next
month.
Without inflation the total package is worth Pounds 4.38m over five years.
It represents a pay cut from Mr Ronson's current salary of Pounds 1.4m.
The business plan underlying the refinancing of Heron's Pounds 1.7bn debts
as at November - when sterling's weakness increased the value of foreign
currency borrowings - depends on a recovery in the property market.
Heron says its property portfolio is worth Pounds 900m, making the two
deals, one set for the middle and the other for the end of June, worth just
10 per cent of the total. Its disposal plans include housebuilder Heron
Homes.
It argues that the only alternative to the bank-backed restructuring would
be lengthy and less rewarding insolvency proceedings.
One bond holder representative has conceded that the restructuring must go
ahead although it is 'flawed', because any suggestion that the restructuring
plan had to be renegotiated could lead to the banks withdrawing support.
