FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc clarifies action
for US interest
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals group, yesterday said it would not take
any steps involving its 68 per cent interest in US drugs group Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer without first consulting the company's management.
Earlier this week, the US company's shares leapt on news that its French
parent was considering various options, including 'transactions relating to
business combinations, mergers or transfers of assets or securities'.
The stock market saw that statement, contained in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, as an indication that Rhone-Poulenc was
considering buying out the remainder of its US subsidiary's shares.
Yesterday, in another filing with the SEC, the French company laid out
consultation procedures it would go through if it planned to take any
action. The company said the timing of the latest filing was purely an
administrative matter, and had not been prompted by the reaction to its
first statement.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's shares, which had jumped from Dollars 33 3/8 before
the first filing to Dollars 38 5/8 on Tuesday, closed Dollars 2 down at
Dollars 35 5/8 on Wall Street yesterday.
When it acquired Rorer in 1990, Rhone-Poulenc signed a standstill agreement
under which it cannot increase its holding before the end of July 1997,
unless it first secures the support of a majority of the US company's
non-executive directors.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, which suffered slightly lower profits last year,
refused to comment yesterday, but referred questions to its French parent.
For 1993 the company made net profits of Dollars 408.7m, down about 5 per
cent on unchanged sales of Dollars 4.02bn.
