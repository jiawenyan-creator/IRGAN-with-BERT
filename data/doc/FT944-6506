FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BFI reduces its conditions for Pounds 391m
Attwoods takeover
Browning-Ferris Industries of the US yesterday reduced its conditions for
the takeover of Attwoods, the UK waste services company for which it has
made a hostile Pounds 391m cash takeover bid, writes Our Financial Staff in
London.
BFI said it would proceed with its offer provided a simple majority of
Attwoods' shareholders voted to accept the bid by December 2, the closing
date for the offer.
The US group previously said it would have proceeded with the offer only if
90 per cent of Attwoods' shareholders approved.
Mr Philip Angell of BFI last night rejected suggestions that this latest
move meant BFI was worried about the level of acceptances for the bid. 'We
are optimistic about the way the bid is progressing and feel very good about
the level of acceptances,' he said.
'We have lowered one condition. It means we can take control of the company
at 50.1 per cent whether or not we get 90 per cent'.
BFI is today expected to disclose the level of acceptances it has received
to-date for its offer.
The BFI bid is also dependent on receiving an anti-trust exemption from the
US government.
Mr Angell said he expected the review to be concluded in BFI's favour before
the end of this week.
