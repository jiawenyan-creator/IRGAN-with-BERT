  [Excerpts] Vientiane, March 18 (KPL) -- The new state 
policy and the socioeconomic development plan of Laos currently 
implemented until the year 2000 will ensure an 8 percent annual 
increase in economic growth. The socioeconomic activities will 
need to concentrate on management of inflation rate at a level 
of no more than 10 percent increase per annum and the promotion 
of the investment in various sectors with no less than 15 
percent of the gross domestic products. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Somphong Mongkhonvilai, vice-president of the Committee 
for Planning and Economic Cooperation of the Lao PDR [People's 
Democratic Republic] pointed out that the economic structure in 
the country was based first and foremost on the country's 
agriculture and forestry sector which should be closely linked 
to processing industry. [passage omitted] 
  The urgent task, he said, was to concentrate efforts to 
integrated rural development activities, to improve the economic 
mechanism and get rid of the remnants of the former centralised, 
state-subsidised economic management mechanism and replacing 
this with the market-oriented mechanism. [passage omitted]
