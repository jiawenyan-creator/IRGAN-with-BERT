A BRIEF HISTORY OF SOUTH COUNTY 
1776 Mission San Juan Capistrano is established by Father Junipero Serra. 
1835 Richard Henry Dana Jr. sails into the port of what is today Dana Point. He 
refers to it as "the only romantic spot in California" in his book "Two Years 
Before the Mast." 
1864 James Irvine and several partners purchase the Ranchos Lomas de Santiago 
and San Joaquin, as well as a portion of the Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana, and 
form the Irvine Ranch. Irvine will become sole owner of the property two years 
later. 
1894 James Irvine incorporates his 108,000-acre ranch property as the Irvine 
Co., and the land begins a transformation from grazing to farming. 
1906 The Balboa Pavilion opens. 
1926 Coast Highway reaches Laguna Beach. 
1929 San Clemente is founded by Ole Hanson, who wants to build a "Spanish 
Village by the Sea." 
1932 Laguna Beach holds its first Festival of the Arts. 
1936 Newport Harbor is dedicated. 
1943 The El Toro Marine Corps Air Station opens on 4,000 acres of Irvine Ranch 
land. 
1960 With the completion of a 5.8-mile stretch of Interstate 5 between San Juan 
Capistrano and San Clemente, the southern tip of Orange County is linked to the 
north by modern highway. The stretch will become the major travel artery 
between Los Angeles and San Diego.

1988 The Orange County Board of Supervisors approves the Irvine Coast plan 
after more than two decades of wrangling. The plan for the 2.5-mile stretch of

leave 76% of the site's nearly 10,000 acres untouched.
