FT  28 FEB 92 / Technology: Samsung in deal with HP
Samsung Electronics, the South Korean company which rivals the leading
Japanese makers in memory chip technology, will later this year launch a
series of low-cost computers based on chip designs pioneered by Hewlett
Packard.
The new Samsung machines will be the result of a series of far-reaching
agreements signed between the two companies, according to Yong Moon Jung,
president of Samsung's telecommunications division.
The agreements will give Samsung access to HP's 'precision architecture'
designs, a form of reduced instruction set computing (Risc) technology. Risc
technology, invented by International Business Machines, is becoming
increasingly popular for high-performance personal computers and network
servers.
Samsung will sell the new machines under its own name, but will also sell
versions of the processor to third parties.
The two companies have already collaborated to develop a single-chip version
of precision architecture; IBM, Apple and Motorola in the US have announced
a similar programme to produce a single-chip version of IBM's own Risc chip
set.
Although HP retains ownership of the technology, Samsung claims to have done
most of the work on the new chip and will make it in its South Korean
semiconductor plants for itself, HP and for third parties. It will be the
first time a Far Eastern manufacturer has been able to produce
high-specification microprocessor chips for the mass market.
The deal gives HP extra volume and market leverage to counter competition
from the US makers IBM, Sun Microsystems and Mips, all of which are
currently vying to set the standard for Risc in the 1990s.
Samsung already produces all the main components of PCs except the central
processing unit. Processing units for high-performance IBM-like PCs are
available only from Intel and AMD of the US.
