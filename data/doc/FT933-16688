FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Revenue disclaims link in Polly
case
THE INLAND Revenue said yesterday that the connection between a senior tax
investigator and the Serious Fraud Office in relation to Polly Peck
International was 'complete news to us'.
In wider-ranging comments than it has previously made, it admitted that Mr
Allcock, the head of special office 2, which deals with tax issues connected
to City fraud, had been suspending as a result of alleged public corruption
offences including bribery.
Mr Allcock strenuously denies the charges, but said through his solicitor on
Wednesday that he was instrumental in the referral to the SFO of the affairs
of Mr Asil Nadir, the chairman of Polly Peck International who jumped bail
for northern Cyprus in May.
Under section 182 of the 1989 Finance Act the Revenue is prevented in all
but the most exceptional conditions from discussing taxpayers' affairs with
third parties, including the police.
But it said yesterday it would permit tax investigators to 'drop a hint (to
other relevant authorities) if something funny is going on, if we get
something worthwhile in return'.
The Revenue rejected suggestions that Mr Allcock's suspension had in any way
jeopardised other tax investigations being conducted by special office 2.
It also said it was unaware of any connection between the suspension and any
specific cases such as the affairs of Mr Nadir.
