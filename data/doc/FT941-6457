FT  02 MAR 94 / Dutch reconsider phone tax
The Dutch government yesterday said it would reconsider its plans to levy a
special tax on the profits of companies operating mobile phone networks,
writes Ronald van de Krol. The move came after a majority of parties in
parliament expressed their opposition to the planned 7.5 per cent tax. The
special mobile telephone tax, which would have been the world's first, had
been attacked as a threat to the development of modern mobile communications
in the Netherlands.
