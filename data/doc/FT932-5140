FT  05 JUN 93 / Traffic ban in City proposed
SOME traffic could be banned from the City of London to try to combat
terrorists, it was disclosed last night.
Checkpoints would be used to enforce the ban on non-essential vehicles, Mr
Michael Cassidy, City corporation planning chairman, said.
The proposal is still at the 'blueprint' stage, but other measures are
already in hand. These include removing all litter bins until they can be
made bomb-proof and allocating resources for 57 extra police constables.
The corporation began a detailed examination of security after the
Bishopsgate bomb in April.
