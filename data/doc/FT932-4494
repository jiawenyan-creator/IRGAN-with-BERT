FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heath urges shake-up in
anti-terrorism strategy
DRAMATIC changes in the government's anti-terrorism policy, including a new
central counter-terrorist agency, to stop IRA bomb attacks on the City and
elsewhere, were urged yesterday by Sir Edward Heath.
The former prime minister called for the appointment of a senior cabinet
minister as an anti-terrorist 'supremo' and said the government should
consider providing public money to help collect information on
paramilitaries.
Sir Edward was incredulous that, in spite of experience in Northern Ireland,
security forces had failed to prevent the IRA planting enough explosive in
the City to cause Pounds 300m of damage.
The state had to outwit terrorists, he said. 'You have to be cleverer in
intelligence, cleverer in action, and cleverer politically and to be
perfectly blunt, we have failed in all three.'
MI5, the domestic security agency, had failed to adjust to the post-Cold War
era, he said. He backed the setting up of a centralised counter-terrorism
agency to integrate intelligence networks.
Sir Edward's comments came as MPs debated the renewal of the government's
emergency powers in Northern Ireland. Adding to the embarrassment of
ministers, he also called for the Rev Ian Paisley, hardline leader of the
Democratic Unionist party, to be excluded from political talks on the
province's future.
The former prime minister said the Sunningdale power-sharing deal of the
1970s had worked only because he had excluded Mr Paisley. 'He doesn't want
agreement, he always does everything possible to prevent agreement,' Sir
Edward said.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, is trying to re-start talks
but Mr Paisley has refused so far to meet him.
