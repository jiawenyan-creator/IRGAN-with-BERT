  [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- Our country will 
have a share of $16 million in the $100 million aid package 
allocated by the Japanese Government for nuclear arms 
dismantling in Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, the 
Japanese Embassy told UNIAN on 4 May. Japan is expecting 
Ukraine to submit specific projects for this amount. 
  According to Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, the two countries 
are working on a joint declaration on principles of relations 
and cooperation between Ukraine and Japan, a memorandum on 
mutual understanding between the two countries' Foreign 
Ministries, and an intergovernmental agreement on mutual 
encouragement and protection of investments. They are also 
working on the issue of Ukraine's succession to the laws and 
agreements that regulated the relations between Japan and the 
former USSR.
