FT  29 JUN 93 / Hurdle for Walker in bankruptcy appeal
MR GEORGE WALKER, the former chairman of Brent Walker, was told yesterday he
cannot proceed with his appeal against bankruptcy unless he puts up Pounds
18,000 in advance to cover part of his opponent's legal costs should the
move fail.
The Court of Appeal granted the 'security for costs' order to Mr Raymond
Hocking of accountants Stoy Hayward who obtained the bankruptcy ruling
against Mr Walker in April.
The order was made because Mr Walker failed to honour his obligations to
creditors under the voluntary arrangement supervised by Mr Hocking.
