FT  08 NOV 93 / International Company News: Airline talks fail to choose US
partner
MERGER TALKS between Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian
Airlines System (SAS) and Austrian Airlines broke up at the weekend without
any agreement on the choice of a US partner.
Failure to achieve the breakthrough increased worries that the Alcazar
project linking four airlines might collapse.
Talk of a collapse was dismissed by the parties involved.
Mr Otto Loepfe, Swissair chief executive, was quoted as saying: 'There will
be further negotiations. Alcazar is still open and not on the rocks.'
SAS, which hosted the talks in Stockholm, said progress had been made and
further talks were scheduled through to the end of the month.
The choice of the US airline has created difficulties because the European
carriers already have close links with US partners: KLM with Northwest
Airlines, Swissair with Delta Airlines and SAS with Continental Airlines.
According to one view, Swissair and KLM would prefer to throw the ball into
the court of the US transportation department to get a view on whether KLM's
open-skies agreement with the US would be extended to the whole of Alcazar.
