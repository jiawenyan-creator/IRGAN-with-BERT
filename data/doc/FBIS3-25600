  [Text] Brazzaville, 19 Feb (AFP) -- Congolese President 
Pascal Lissouba went to Gbadolite in northeastern Zaire to meet 
his Zairean counterpart, Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko, it was 
learned from well- informed sources in Brazzaville. President 
Lissouba left the Congolese capital aboard a special plane 
chartered by Marshal Mobutu, at whose initiative this meeting is 
taking place, these sources point out. 
  This meeting, of only a few hours, is expected to be devoted 
to relations between the two countries, which have recently 
experienced a "little bit of tension" following maltreatment of 
some Zairean nationals in the Congolese capital. President 
Lissouba, whose departure was not officially announced, is 
expected back in his country later this afternoon.
