  [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- Mass rallies were held 
in Haeju and Kaesong to denounce the U.S. imperialists and the 
Kim Yong-sam group's shipment of Patriot missiles in South Korea. 
  Speakers at the rallies branded the introduction into South 
Korea of Patriot by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
ruling quarters as an outrageous challenge to the desire of the 
entire Korean nation for peace and denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula, as an unpardonable nation-annihilating act to 
provoke a nuclear war by intentionally straining the situation. 
  They warned that though they are bringing dark clouds of a 
nuclear war to this land, the U.S. imperialists and the South 
Korean puppets should clearly know that the Korean people are 
never afraid of a war. 
  The speakers declared that the Korean people and 
revolutionary Armed Forces, rallied rock-firm behind Supreme 
Commander General Kim Chong-il, would make a thousand-fold 
retaliation against the aggressors, annihilating them at a 
stroke, if they dare to provoke the socialist motherland of 
Korea.
