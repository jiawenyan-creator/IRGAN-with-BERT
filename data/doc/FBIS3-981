  [Excerpt] The University of Lagos today announced the 
postponement of its 1993 convocation ceremonies earlier 
scheduled to begin tomorrow. The postponement was attributed to 
the closure of the university last Saturday [12 March]. 
  Meanwhile, the vice chancellor of the University of Lagos, 
Professor Nuredeen Alaho, has blamed the media for the present 
closure of the university. He alleged that the media overplayed 
reports of secret societies in the university. Prof. Alaho told 
the Lagos state administrator, Colonel O. Oyinlola, that the 
media did not put into consideration the interest of the nation 
while reporting the cult issues. [passage omitted]
