  [Text] Caracas, 18 Jan (AFP) -- The street disturbances of 
the past days in Venezuela are reportedly part of a "political 
conspiracy" to mar the inauguration on Wednesday of president 
Rafael Caldera, Interior Minister Carlos Delgado Chapillin said 
on Friday. 
  "Everything is a conspiracy, a preconceived plan to disrupt 
the peace. The idea is to mar the inauguration of the new 
government and the functioning of the Congress," Delgado told 
newsmen. He added that classes will be suspended in those 
schools where disturbances take place. 
  The protests and turmoil in Caracas and major cities in the 
interior of the country have gone beyond student skirmishes. On 
Saturday, 18 January, over 100 persons were arrested in 
Barcelona (in the west) for setting fire and looting food 
trucks. The unrest extended the next day to neighboring Puerto 
La Cruz, Valencia (in the center), and Punto Fijo (in the 
northeast). 
  This week there were transportation strikes in several 
cities 
but the disturbances were concentrated in schools in the 
metropolitan areas of Caracas. A 17-year-old student was killed 
in the bedroom community of Los Teques in the midst of a 
skirmish between students and police.
