FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead
WILLIAMS Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, is expected to show a 5 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 168m to Pounds 160m, when it
announces full-year results on Thursday. The company's exposure to d-i-y and
aerospace markets are behind the likely slip in earnings per share to 20.1p
(22.8p). The dividend is expected to be maintained.
Another round of write-downs on property and the Channel Tunnel contract is
thought to have kept BICC's pre-tax profit flat at about Pounds 80m last
year. It reports on Wednesday.
Two more composite insurance companies, General Accident and Guardian Royal
Exchange, are expected to report sharply-reduced losses next week. Rising
premium rates and milder weather are mainly responsible for the improvement.
GA is expected to report a loss of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m on
Tuesday, compared with a deficit of Pounds 171.6m in 1991. On Wednesday, GRE
could also report losses of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 40m, against
losses of Pounds 209.7m in 1991.
Fisons, the drugs and scientific instrument group, reports its full-year
results on Tuesday. Analysts are unsure about the net impact of disposals
during the past 12 months, which must now be carried above the line to
conform to the new FRS3 accounting standard. Lehman Brothers estimates the
underlying business will report profits down from Pounds 190.5m last year to
about Pounds 105m. This represents a 50 per cent improvement during the
second half of the year.
The 1992 results for Barclays will be announced on Thursday. These will be
preceded on Tuesday by Abbey National, and on Wednesday by Midland. Barclays
is expected to make a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 100m, and a retained loss
of Pounds 500-Pounds 600m after maintaining the final dividend. But BZW is
predicting a cut in the dividend.
Abbey National will make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 570m, and retained
profits of about Pounds 200m. Its provisions for possible bad debts are
expected to double to about Pounds 320m, reflecting the depressed UK housing
market. Midland is expected to show the effect of a significant lightening
of its provisions for possible bad debts to about Pounds 700m for the year,
compared with Pounds 903m in 1991. This is expected to boost pre-tax profits
to about Pounds 200m from Pounds 36m.
