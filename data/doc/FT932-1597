FT  23 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Transport police to survive
sell-off
RAIL operators will be required to use the British Transport Police after
privatisation to maintain law and order on the railways, the government
announced yesterday. The force will, however, be optional for some security
guard duties.
Costs of the police will be met by rail businesses using the service.
British Transport Police's responsibilities for policing the London
Underground will be unchanged.
