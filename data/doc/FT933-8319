FT  17 AUG 93 / Australia sees investment from Japan decline
JAPANESE investment in Australia is shrinking, Australia's foreign affairs
and trade department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Canberra.
'While lower Japanese investment in Australia is part of a global slowdown
in Japanese long-term capital outflow, the contraction has been much more
severe in Australia than elsewhere,' the department said in its latest
Quarterly Economic and Trade Review.
In 1989/1990, Japan's share of foreign investment in Australia was larger
than that of any other country. Now Japan was the third largest investor in
the country behind Britain and the US, the report said.
Japanese investors had withdrawn more than ADollars 4bn (Pounds 1.82bn) in
investments in Australia in the six months to March 1993. Weakness in the
Australian dollar may have contributed to the drop in Japanese interest.
Weak global commodity prices may also have contributed by damping investment
in Australian mining, the report added.
