The World Jewish Congress, which opened its first office in a Communist country 
this week, could open one in the Soviet Union in the near future, the group's 
president said. The new office, opened Monday in Budapest, Hungary, is designed 
to work with Hungary's 80,000 Jews and with the small Jewish populations in 
other East European countries outside the Soviet Union. "My guess is that (we) 
will have an office in the Soviet Union within the next two years," Edgar M. 
Bronfman, the group's president, said. But he said Soviet Jews, estimated to 
number at least 1.8 million, would first have to become more organized.
