FT  26 FEB 93 / Gonzalez defends policy
PRIME MINISTER Felipe Gonzalez yesterday rejected calls to stage early
elections and insisted that Spain would remain within the European Monetary
System.
Mr Gonzalez, who is being buffeted by waning public support, divisions
within his governing socialist party and by market pressure on the peseta,
said it would 'irresponsible' to hold elections in the present climate. He
wished to serve out his term until the autumn, 'by which time it is possible
some of the uncertainties will have disappeared'.
Speaking to a large gathering of senior businessmen in Madrid, Mr Gonzalez
said he hoped economic pressures would abate as his government made it clear
that it would not swerve from its policy of tight monetary discipline within
the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS.
'We will resolutely and permanently maintain our rigorous policy to contain
the deficit and reduce inflation,' Mr Gonzalez said. He said the high
domestic interest rates would not be eased until salary restraint brought
down labour costs and boosted Spain's competitiveness.
Mr Gonzalez added he would resist calls to artificially inject growth into
the economy and that he had no intention of letting the peseta float. He
firmly backed the government's economic team and risked criticism from the
left wing of his party and the unions.
The business leaders, who are currently facing overnight money market rates
of 19 per cent, gave Mr Gonzalez a lukewarm reception. The leader of Spain's
employers' association said the pro-union strike law sponsored in parliament
by Mr Gonzalez's party was 'a declaration of war' against the business
community. Earlier the association's chief economist urged a major
devaluation of the peseta, even at the expense of leaving the ERM.
For the first time in several days, the Bank of Spain reduced its
intervention on the money markets as pressure on the peseta eased.
