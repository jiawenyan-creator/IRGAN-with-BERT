FT  24 MAR 94 / RPI rise biggest for 10 months
February's 0.6 per cent rise in the retail prices index was the largest
monthly increase since April last year and marks the end of a series of
better-than-expected inflation figures.
Nearly all the main categories of the RPI showed price increases in February
as prices bounced back from the effects of the January sales.
The biggest single increase was in clothing and footwear, where prices rose
by 2.7 per cent over the month, the largest February rise since 1941.
However, that followed a 5.1 per cent fall in January, the largest monthly
drop since 1921. Clothing and footwear contributed 0.16 per cent to the
RPI's 0.6 per cent monthly rise.
Prices of personal goods and services rose 2.3 per cent over the month,
mainly because of increases in the prices of spectacles, following the
January sales.
Although prices of food and motoring expenditure rose by 0.6 per cent over
the month, both increases were smaller than in February 1993. This meant
that February's RPI increase was smaller than the 0.7 per cent recorded in
February last year, allowing the annual rate to drop back to 2.4 per cent
from 2.5 per cent in January. If mortgage interest payments are excluded,
the annual increase in underlying inflation was 2.8 per cent, the same as in
January.
The RPI rose to 142.1 in February, after falling 0.4 per cent to 141.3 in
January. February's increase still means that the RPI is only 0.1 per cent
higher than its September 1993 level.
Analysts were divided on whether the figures represented a resumption of
inflationary pressures, or were merely a blip. 'The inflation figures are
not as bad as they look,' said Mr Kit Juckes, economist at SG Warburg
Securities. 'There is not enough strength in the economy for the price
increases to stick.'
Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at James Capel, said he still believed that
inflation would fall below 2 per cent. He pointed to recent weak producer
prices figures, arguing that they were a forward indicator of the RPI. Capel
estimates that core inflation over the last three months has been running at
an annualised rate of 1.6 per cent.
However, Mr John Marsland, an economist at UBS, said: 'We think the recent
price increases will stick and we will see further small increases over the
rest of the year.' UBS forecasts that underlying inflation will be 3.25 per
cent by the end of this year, and headline inflation will be 3.5 per cent.
The Central Statistical Office has produced its new weightings for the RPI
in 1994, a move which led to the monthly inflation figures being published a
week later than normal.
The main change is the inclusion of UK holidays for the first time: foreign
holidays made their debut last year. The effect has been to increase the
weighting of leisure services.
