unit
NORMANDY Poseidon, the diversified Australian gold mining house, has
proposed the sale of its controlling 42.8 per cent shareholding in Command
Petroleum, its petroleum offshoot, to Snyder Oil, a US oil group, for
ADollars 25.7m (USDollars 18.3m), writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
The transaction - at ADollars 28 cents a share, against yesterday's closing
