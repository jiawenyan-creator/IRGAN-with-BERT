FT  03 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Insurers grab spotlight as
rally slackens
Wall Street
THE STOCK market continued to claw back its recent losses yesterday, but
late profit-taking and computerised sell programmes more than halved the
early session gain, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 8.41 higher at 2,938.61,
having been almost 20 points ahead initially. The broader-based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 ended a marginal 0.24 firmer at 380.53. The Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks, with the help of a rally in technology issues,
outperformed the other indices, finishing up 3.28 at 491.13.
Turnover on the New York SE was a moderate 187m shares, while rises
outnumbered falls by 948 to 612.
The market is still drawing strength from Tuesday's discount rate cut and
the subsequent prime rate reductions by the big money centre banks.
Investors, who had been worried by the depth and length of the recession,
are buying stocks in the hope that lower borrowing costs will stimulate
business activity and bring the economy out of its slump well before the end
of the year.
The insurance sector grabbed the spotlight as some of the biggest groups
reported first-quarter earnings. USF&amp;G put on Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 11 3/8
in spite of unveiling a consolidated net loss of Dollars 55m in the period,
against a profit of Dollars 51m at the same stage in 1990.
AIG shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 90 3/8 after reporting a modest increase in
net income to Dollars 375.4m, from Dollars 355.7m a year ago. General
Reinsurance, down Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 90 1/4 , revealed just a 2 per
cent rise in net income to Dollars 150.4m, from the first quarter of 1990.
Banks were mixed in the wake of lower interest rates. BankAmerica stood out
with a rise of Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 39 5/8 .
Mesa Airlines advanced Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 14 3/4 and Atlantic
Southeast Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 29 1/2 on the secondary market following
a buy recommendation from securities house Kidder Peabody. Delta Airlines,
quoted on the NYSE, gained Dollars 2 to Dollars 74 in sympathy.
Amgen jumped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 133 3/4 on turnover of 1.7m after
surprising analysts with fiscal fourth-quarter net income of 78 cents a
share, well up on the 18 cents earned in the corresponding period. Another
drug company, Synergen, added Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 29 1/2 on news that
phase two trials have begun on its septic shock drug.
Duracell, taken private nearly three years ago in a leveraged buy-out,
returned to the market yesterday, with investors snapping up the stock. Just
over 20m shares, or two-thirds of the issue, had changed hands by the close,
with the price ending at Dollars 20 3/4 , up nearly 40 per cent from its
offer price of Dollars 15.
Over-the-counter technology stocks closed higher, with Apple recovering from
recent losses to gain Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 49 and Sun Microsystems
putting on Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 36 7/8 on 1.5m turnover.

SOME disappointing first-quarter results restrained the Toronto market,
which ended with just a slightly firmer bias after Wednesday's enthusiasm
over the cut in interest rates. Attention is now focused on today's US
report on April employment.
The composite index edged up 7.9 to 3,500.9 and advances led declines by 267
to 260 after volume of 20.5m shares.
Hemlo Gold, up CDollars  3/8 at CDollars 8 3/8 , said it is considering
buying all of Noranda's gold assets in exchange for 8,611,410 common shares
of Hemlo, equivalent to about 10 per cent of Hemlo's outstanding shares.
Noranda gained CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 18 1/8 .
