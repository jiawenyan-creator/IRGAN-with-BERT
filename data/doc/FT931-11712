FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: CP sees return to profit this
year
CANADIAN PACIFIC, the transport, resources and property group that was
forced to restructure by the long North American recession, staged a
turnround in the final quarter of 1992 and expects to be profitable in 1993.
Operations at the group's rail, road and marine transport units remained
depressed, but the thriving PanCanadian Petroleum oil and gas subsidiary
doubled its contribution. Forest product losses were much lower, while
property and hotels improved.
Mr William Stinson, chairman, said that 'slowly improving economic
conditions together with rising efficiency should lead to a return to
profitability in 1993'.
CP posted a CDollars 2.7m (USDollars 2.1m) profit in the final quarter of
1992, against a loss of CDollars 29m a year earlier, but after special
charges the final loss came out at CDollars 254m, or 80 cents a share,
against a loss of CDollars 887.6m, or CDollars 2.79, in 1991.
Revenues were CDollars 2bn, compared with CDollars 2.5bn, but the decline
was partly due to disposals.
For the whole of 1992, the company posted a loss of CDollars 37.4m before
special charges, against a loss of CDollars 16.2m a year earlier. The final
loss rose to CDollars 478.3m, or CDollars 1.50 a share, against a deficit of
CDollars 913.8m, or CDollars 2.87, in 1991. Revenues fell to CDollars 8.9bn
from CDollars 10bn.
The 1992 special charges covered continued rail and truck rationalisation
and manpower cuts, and a write-down of CP's investment in its US industrial
products associate.
CP Rail performed poorly because of the recession. The western coal
operations were hit by a strike, but have since been expanded by acquisition
and should improve in 1993.
Telecommunications were not profitable. The group's stake in Unitel
Communications, the Canadian telecoms company, has dropped below 50 per cent
following the CDollars 150m purchase by AT&amp;T of the US of a 20 per cent
interest.
PanCanadian, with sharply higher earnings from rising oil and gas
production, is spending CDollars 430 m on exploration and development this
year, up 2 per cent from 1992.
CP Forest should return to profitability in the second half of 1993, while
Marathon Realty's and CP Hotels' progress may be held back by the slow
recovery. Container shipping has a slightly better outlook, while the
associate Laidlaw is improving.
