FT  16 APR 92 / CIS 'needs Dollars 20bn extra aid this year'
THE former Soviet republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
may need Dollars 20bn aidthis year, in addition to the Dollars 24bn already
planned by industrialised nations for Russia, the International Monetary
Fund has warned.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said in Washington yesterday he
had finished membership negotiations with 14 of the 15 republics - leaving
only Azerbaijan to complete the process - and hoped IMF members would
approve these arrangements by April 27, in time for the organisation's
spring meeting.
But he warned that the former Soviet Union would continue to require
substantial help for several years.
'The process of adjustment will be very difficult, very disruptive, but we
believe the burden of adjustment can be eased by financial assistance from
abroad,' he said.
The negotiation of membership quotas for all republics will play a
significant role in determining how much money they can borrow from the IMF,
once each has completed all its membership formalities and each has agreed
with the Fund a comprehensive economic adjustment programme.
Each country would normally be allowed to negotiate annual IMF drawings
equivalent to its quota, although Mr Camdessus said the size of the loan
arrangements was also tied to its needs and to the strength of its economic
programme.
The IMF chief said his organisation expected to invest Dollars 25bn to
Dollars 30bn in the former Soviet republics, including Russia, over the next
four years. The World Bank is expected to invest Dollars 12bn to Dollars
15bn over the same period, while the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development will also make a significant contribution.
This would still, however, leave a significant shortfall to be made up by
bilateral assistance similar to the Dollars 24bn package agreed for Russia
by the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
