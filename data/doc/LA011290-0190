SHORT TAKES; 
'ROSEANNE' GETS A PEACEMAKER 
A producer who specializes in handling hot-blooded talent has been brought in 
to smooth relations between Roseanne Barr and the producers of her top-ranked 
ABC-TV comedy series, "Roseanne." 
Jay Daniel, a former producer at ABC's "Moonlighting," joined "Roseanne" with 
the title of executive producer for Carsey-Werner Productions, David Brokaw, a 
spokesman for the company, said Thursday. 
Barr reportedly has wanted her character to express more anger than the 
producers and writers would agree to. She had the show's creator and original 
executive producer, Matt Williams, fired, and recently asked to get rid of his 
successor, Jeff Harris. 
"We're looking to make Roseanne happier," said Marcy Carsey of Carsey-Werner. 
"Roseanne feels she needs another person to listen to her. So whatever we can 
do to make her happy we'll do. The shows are wonderful, so whatever Roseanne 
has to go through to get there, in the end, results in great television." 
At "Moonlighting," Daniel was credited with settling problems between the 
production company and Cybill Shepherd, who starred in the show with Bruce 
Willis.
