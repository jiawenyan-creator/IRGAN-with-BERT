COMMENTARY OF '89; 
JUDY B. ROSENER ON THE COASTAL ACT 
During 1989, many Orange County residents wrote about their thoughts and 
feelings in commentary pieces for Orange County opinion pages. As the year 
comes to a close, we look back on some of those thoughts. 
It is no accident that those who use Coast Highway have a glorious view of the 
Pacific Ocean for a three-mile stretch along the Irvine Coast. 
It is no accident that the public now has access to the beaches that hug the 
bluffs that line the water's edge. 
It is no accident that when development takes place on the inland side of the 
Irvine down-coast property, wildlife habitats will be protected, the watershed 
will remain, the effects of traffic and air pollution will be minimized, and 
both the public and the landowner will benefit. 
The legacy of the Coastal Act is not easy to assess. It is as much measured in 
the development you don't see as in the quality of development you do see. It 
is as much measured in the views and public access you enjoy as in the citizen 
participation that made the views and access possible. 
It is as much measured in changed attitudes about protecting the environment as 
in seeing how public-private partnerships have been forged to protect coastal 
resources. 
As we anticipate the reaction that will come when the hotels, roads and houses 
begin to sprout along the Irvine coast, we should remind ourselves of what 
might have been!
