  [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- Viktor Posuvalyuk, Russian 
president's special envoy of Middle East affairs and director of 
the Middle East and North Africa Department in the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, held a meeting with Lebanese Foreign Minister 
Faris Bouez on Thursday. At the meeting they discussed the 
situation which has emerged during the regional peace process, 
in particular, in its Lebanese-Israeli direction. 
  Posuvalyuk said at a press conference that his Middle East 
tour is being undertaken on the instructions from President 
Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. He 
emphasised that Moscow and Washington, the co-sponsors of the 
Arab-Israeli negotiations, are constantly coordinating with each 
other. 
  When asked to comment upon Islamist leader Mustafa Dirani's 
capture by an Israeli commando group, Posuvalyuk emphasised that 
the Russian Foreign Ministry is against any actions which may 
complicate the situation in the region. 
  The Russian envoy noted the special importance of the 50th 
anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations between Russia 
and Lebanon. In this context, he spoke in favour of the 
activisation of commercial ties between the two countries, 
which, according to the diplomat, must be strengthened by an 
appropriate legal basis.
