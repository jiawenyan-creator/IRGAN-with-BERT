 

Following subsection 5(g)(4)(B) is a provision which provides as follows: ``[u]nder IC 134.1116(c),
the administrative law judge shall issue the findings and a non-final order within 60 days after conclusion of the
hearing.'' This provision, which allows the ALJ 60 days to render a non-final order, would leave no time for the commission
to render its final decision and still conform to the 60-day time limit provided by 30 CFR 843.13(c). The proposed language
is also inconsistent with proposed subsections 5(g)(3) and 5(h) which are no less effective than the 60-day provision
at 30 CFR 843.13(c). Therefore, the Director finds that the language quoted above in this paragraph is less effective
than the Federal regulations and cannot be approved. In addition, the Director is requiring that Indiana further
amend 310 1AC 0.615 by deleting the language quoted above.

Subsection 5(h) is amended to set a 50-day deadline for the final order of the commission following the issuance of
the director's recommended order or the ALJ findings and written recommendations. Amendments also set a 90-day deadline
for the commission's final order following receipt of the order to show cause by the permittee where the permittee
does not comply with the requirements of 310 IAC 0.615(e). A 60-day deadline is set for the commission's
final order following the hearing or the ALJ's receipt of the permittee's answer filed under 310 IAC 0.615(e)
if no hearing was requested nor necessary. The Director finds this provision to be consistent with 30 CFR 843.13(c)
and fully satisfies the required program amendment at 30 CFR 914.16(d).

Subsection 5(i), which was formerly found at subsection 5(g)(1), is amended by replacing ``administrative law judge''
with ``commission'' and adding a reference to 310 IAC 12 at the end of the first sentence. The Director finds these changes
clarify responsibilities and procedures under the Indiana program and are consistent with 30 CFR 843.13.

Old subsection 5(j), which limited the number of hearings available to one before the director and one before the commission,
is deleted. The Director finds that this deletion, which has no Federal counterpart, does not render 310 IAC 0.615
inconsistent with 30 CFR 843.13 and 43 CFR 4.1190 through 4.1196, because the procedures for a hearing remain clear
in the section.

With the exceptions noted above, the Director finds that the proposed changes to 310 IAC 0.615 are consistent
with and no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 843.13 and 43 CFR 4.1190 through 4.1196. In addition,
the Director finds that the required program amendment codified at 30 CFR 914.16(d) is satisfied by these amendments
and can be removed.



2. 310 IAC 0.6113Awards of Litigation Expenses



Subsection 13(c) is amended by changing ``IC 13857'' to read ``IC 138157.''
The Director finds that this correction of the citation does not render the provision less effective than 43 CFR 4.1294
concerning the award of costs and expenses.



3. 310 IAC 0.735Delegations



New subsection 5(a) is added and provides that 310 IAC 0.735 governs the delegation of authority by the
Natural Resources Commission with respect to the Bureau of Mine Reclamation and with respect to the Division of Reclamation.
Subsection 5(c) is deleted. This provision would grant the deputy director of the IDNR authority to take action to
forfeit a bond. The Director finds that there are no Federal counterparts to the language proposed to be added and deleted,
and that the addition and deletion does not render the Indiana program less effective than SMCRA or the Federal regulations.
