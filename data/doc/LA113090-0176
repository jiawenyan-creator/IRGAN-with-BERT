P.M. BRIEFING; 
FRANCE EASES GATT TALKS STAND 
France has backed away from its hard-line stand against any concessions at 
world talks to cut farm subsidies, Western diplomats said today. 
The apparent shift could offer a glimmer of hope for compromise at the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's deadlocked talks, which enter their final 
phase next week but are threatened by a major dispute over farm subsidies.
