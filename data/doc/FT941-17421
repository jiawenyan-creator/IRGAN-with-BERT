FT  04 JAN 94 / Japanese win steel plant deal
Perjawa, the Malaysian government-controlled steel company, has awarded
contracts for the construction of two steel plants on peninsular Malaysia's
east coast to a consortium of Japanese companies, writes Kieran Cooke in
Kuala Lumpur.
The consortium - made up of Itochu Corp, Nissho Iwai Corp, Tomen Corp, NKK
Corp and Kawasaki Heavy Industries - is due to start work on the two plants
this month. The consortium said the contracts were worth around Y76bn
(Dollars 689m).
One of the plants to be built will produce steel sheets and other flat steel
products. The other will produce steel bars.
Malaysia is expanding its steel industry and aims to achieve
self-sufficiency in steel products by 1998.
