FT  13 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Commons prepares for clash on
Europe
MPs WERE bracing themselves last night for the possibility of an all-night
sitting when the bill implementing the Maastricht treaty returns to the
Commons today, David Owen writes.
As leading figures on both sides of the Euro-divide finalised preparations
for resumption of battle, there was talk at Westminster that the government
might opt to force a trial of strength with Euro-sceptics and Opposition
tacticians by moving tonight that the debate continue beyond 10pm.
Labour has called a running three-line whip but will not say whether they
would oppose any motion to have tonight's sitting extended. All sides are
playing their cards close to their chest in what is expected to be a tense
and exhausting war of nerves lasting at least until June.
Euro-sceptics remain determined to force an embarrassing reversal and are
making every effort to retain their discipline.
A meeting on tactics was scheduled for last night. Euro-sceptic leaders have
produced a series of detailed briefs on subjects to be covered as the debate
proceeds, aiming to allocate specific briefs to specific people.
The cross-party Commons' members interests committee spent more than two
hours last night agreeing a report on Pounds 18,000 received from an unnamed
donor by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to help evict an unwanted tenant
from his London house.
The report, expected to propose tighter rules for MPs on declaring anonymous
gifts, will be published on Monday.
