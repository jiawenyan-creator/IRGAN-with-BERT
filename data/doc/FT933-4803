FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: M&amp;S orders help Claremont to Pounds 4.42m
MORE ORDERS from Marks and Spencer and two acquisitions helped Claremont
Garments (Holdings), supplier to the high street retailer, lift pre-tax
profits from Pounds 2.83m to Pounds 4.42m in the six months to June 26.
Turnover rose to Pounds 47.1m (Pounds 21.7m) but comparisons are difficult
because Claremont, which sells about 93 per cent of its turnover to M&amp;S,
bought J&amp;J Fashions and Alexander Milnes towards the end of the first half
of 1992.
Mr Peter Wiegand, chairman, said M&amp;S had increased its orders from
Claremont, which generally offset the effects of the retailer's Outstanding
Value campaign. M&amp;S has held about 75 per cent of its clothing prices and
cut prices on the remaining quarter.
'There have not been a lot of price increases but we have seen increased
volume and longer runs which means we make the clothes more efficiently.'
Mr Wiegand said orders were up by about 5 per cent compared with this time
last year. 'We are now looking to move into men's wear and will sell
overcoats this autumn, with men's tailored jackets and leisure wear planned
for next spring.'
The company would also like to supply lingerie in future, Mr Wiegand said.
'If the right thing came along we certainly could be acquisitive. We are
trying to broaden our range.'
Mr David McGarvey, managing director, said the company was aiming to bring
its operating margins of 9.8 per cent up to the 13.3 per cent it was making
before its acquisitions last year and it expected further gains from
rationalisations.
Net debt rose from Pounds 3m at the year-end to Pounds 10.5m, including an
Pounds 8.8m convertible loan note, at the halfway stage, giving gearing up
from 15 per cent to 46 per cent over the six months. Net interest charges
rose to Pounds 186,000 (Pounds 86,000).
The board declared an increased interim dividend of 3.6p (3.3p) out of
earnings per share of 7.3p (6.6p).
