FT  07 NOV 92 / BBC agrees promotion curb
THE BBC will today stop promoting its magazines by showing glossy 'moving'
advertisements and by mentioning them in programmes.
The corporation has given undertakings to Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate
affairs minister.
The BBC will now be allowed to promote its magazines only with 'still' items
between programmes.
The items will be limited to the name, price, publisher and availability of
the magazine. That information will have to be accompanied by a 'general
statement' about the availability of magazines with the same broad content.
The change follows a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report that said the
BBC's use of free airtime to promote its magazines had distorted competition
among food, cookery, television listings and gardening magazines.
The MMC called for an end to 'moving' promotional items and restrictions on
'still' ones. Mr Hamilton went further by saying that competing magazines
also had to be mentioned.
Mr Hamilton said yesterday that in view of the commission's concern he had
asked Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, to continue to
monitor the effects on competition of on-screen BBC promotion of its
magazines.
The MMC inquiry stemmed from an investigation by Mr John Sadler into
cross-media promotion.
