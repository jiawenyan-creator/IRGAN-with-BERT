<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.14(f), DOE announces its intent to award a grant based on an unsolicited application from the
National Urban Coalition, Washington, DC, to provide Clark County School District, Nevada, with the unique approach
of teaching science and math to minority students through the ``Say YES'' project.




Of special importance in the ``Say YES'' approach to teaching science and math to minority students is the highly-developed,
culturally-affirmative, and historically-accurate training curriculum. The curriculum illuminates the dynamic
role of all societies in the development and evolution of math and science. Children, as well as their families and
teachers, learn of the contribution their cultures have made to those fields. They come to see and value themselves
as carrying forward a great tradition within their own group of excellence in math, science, and technology.

The objectives of this project are: (1) to nurture and sustain children's interest in science and math; (2) to train
teachers in better presentation of math and science ideas; (3) to assist students in developing creative and efficient
techniques in problem-solving in science and math through hands-on activity; (4) to aid parents in developing skills
needed for effective partnering with their children in the learning process; (5) to provide appropriate experiences
to assist students in developing an appreciation for the importance of math, science, and critical thinking skills
for successful living; (6) to provide students with information and discuss with them the educational and experimental
requirements for careers in math, science, and related fields; (7) to provide opportunities whereby students will
learn to apply and evaluate communicated ideals relative to relevant issues and current developments in math and
science; (8) to affirm the role of all races and cultures in the history of math and science; (9) to describe and demonstrate
to students the techniques for communicating ideals and issues using the language of math and science with peers and
family members; and (10) to describe and discuss with parents and other interested family members appropriate procedures
for becoming advocates for their children's access to higher level courses, programs, and experience in math and
science.

The project period for the proposed grant award is five years, to be funded annually. The first year funding is $405,068.
The total estimated cost of this award is $1,893,345. This notice is published for public comment at least 14 days prior
to making the award.
