  [Text] Tbilisi, 25 Jan -- IBERIA reports that at today's 
meeting of the Georgian Parliament, Jaba Ioseliani [chief 
Georgian negotiator at talks with the Abkhazians] stated that, 
for reasons unknown to him, an important phrase, "all volunteers 
are to be withdrawn from the conflict zone" had been dropped 
from the text of the Geneva communique distributed to members of 
parliament. 
  In Jaba Ioseliani's opinion, this was a deliberate act of 
sabotage on the part of certain forces, which should be studied 
by the competent authority.
