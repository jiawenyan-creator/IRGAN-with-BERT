FT  31 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
DERIVATIVES markets had another exciting trading session yesterday as
traders reacted to the continuing developments in the ERM currency centres,
writes Terry Byland.
A premium of around 20 points on the September contract on the FT-SE Index
for most of the day offered ample opportunities for arbitraging. These were
readily seized but traders then found that stock in the underlying blue
chips had become very hard to find. At best, September touched 2,963.
By the close, the premium on the September contract had boiled down to
around 17 points against cash. On Monday, fair value will fall to 4 or 5 and
any repetition of yesterday's demand and stock shortage will mean a powerful
squeeze on share prices.
Business in Traded Options increased to 40,488 contracts from 36,070 on
Thursday, with the Footsie option trading 12,265. British Steel (3,874)
headed the list of individual stock options. This was followed by Hillsdown
on 2,307 and Land Securities on 2,100.
