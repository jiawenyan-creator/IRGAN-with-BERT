<DOCTITLE>Naval Research Advisory Committee; Closed Meeting </DOCTITLE>


Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App. 2), notice is hereby given that the
Naval Research Advisory Committee will meet on May 18 and 19, 1994. The meeting will be held at the Naval Air Warfare
Center, Weapons Division, China Lake, California. The meeting will commence at 8 a.m. and terminate at 6 p.m. on May
18; and commence at 8 a.m. and terminate at 4 p.m. on May 19, 1994. All sessions of the meeting will be closed to the public.

The purpose of the meeting is to provide briefings for the Committee related to airborne tactical weapons systems,
naval surface missile systems, tactical and strategic deterrent weapons, and research, design, development, test
and evaluation and support throughout the weapons system life cycle. The agenda will consist of briefings, discussions
and demonstrations on weapons system support, test and evaluation, modeling and simulation technology, core capabilities,
composites fabrication, energetic materials, ordnance, and propulsion, antenna research, and the science and
technology process. These briefings, discussions and demonstrations will contain classified information that
is specifically authorized under criteria established by Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national
defense and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order. The classified and nonclassified matters
to be discussed are so inextricably intertwined as to preclude opening any portion of the meeting. 
Accordingly, the Secretary of the Navy has determined in writing that the public interest requires that all sessions
of the meeting be closed to the public because they will be concerned with matters listed in section 552b(c)(1) of title
5, United States Code. 

This notice is being published late because of administrative delays which constitute an exceptional circumstance,
not allowing Notice to be published in the Federal Register

 at least 15 days before the date of the meeting.
