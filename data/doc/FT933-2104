FT  21 SEP 93 / Vauxhall and Nissan slash car output
VAUXHALL, UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, is cutting car
production sharply at its two assembly plants this month under the impact of
the steep fall in new car sales in continental Europe.
Later this week Nissan, the Japanese manufacturer, is expected to become
another victim of falling European car sales, when it announces a
significant cut in output at its plant in Sunderland, Tyne &amp; Wear, for the
last three months of the year.
However, the company said last night that there would be 'no lay-offs and no
redundancies'.
Ford, the leading UK vehicle maker, has imposed a four-day week at its
Transit van plant in Southampton, Hampshire, throughout September and
October.
Vauxhall is cutting all production of the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra in
its Luton, Bedfordshire plant this week with the loss of nine shifts. It is
cutting 14 shifts in Luton during September, which will eliminate the
production of 5,506 cars.
By the end of September it will have cut 74 shifts this year in the Luton
plant. In the first eight months output at the plant fell 23.8 per cent to
84,630 cars from 111,116 a year ago.
Vauxhall's plant in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, which produces the
Vauxhall/Opel Astra, has virtually been working a three-day week during
September with the elimination of 11 shifts, cutting production of 3,344
cars.
In effect the plant has been closed for production from Thursday afternoon
to Monday afternoon during September. A total of 21 shifts will have been
cut in the first nine months of the year.
In spite of a recovery in UK car sales Vauxhall output has fallen 12.7 per
cent to 168,926 in the first eight months of the year from 193,542 in the
same period last year.
