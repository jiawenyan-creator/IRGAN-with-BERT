<F P=106> [Note by Andrei Badin: "His Majesty King Mihai I Wishes To </F>
Come to His Homeland for Easter or for 10 May"] 
  [Text] "His Majesty King Mihai I of Romania wishes to come 
to his native country for the Holy Easter celebrations or for 10 
May [the king's birthday and formerly Romania's national day], 
more probably for 10 May," Mr. Corneliu Coposu, president of 
the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party [PNTCD], the 
most important opposition party, exclusively told us last night. 
Mr. Coposu was received in audience by His Majesty King Mihai 
on 1 February, between 1000-1730 hours. Their meeting will 
continue today. 
  It is likely that his majesty the king will entrust Mr. 
Corneliu Coposu with a message for the Romanian leadership. The 
PNTCD president told us that he will not convey that message to 
President Ion Iliescu, but only to Messrs. Melescanu [Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu] and Danescu [Interior Minister George 
Ioan Danescu]. The reason why Mr. Coposu does not want to 
discuss the matter with Mr. Iliescu is that the latter has made 
false statements last December in connection with the king's 
envisaged visit. 
  The essence of the king's message, Mr. Coposu said, is that 
he comes as a simple citizen. "The king is not coming in order 
to organize strikes or revolutions. He will come as Romania's 
sovereign, when the majority of the Romanian people calls upon 
him," Mr. Corneliu Coposu told us.
