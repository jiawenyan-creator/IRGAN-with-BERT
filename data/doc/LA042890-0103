HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP; 
TATUM STARTS GROSSMONT WITH 2 HOMERS IN INNING 
Santana Coach Jim Saska will breath a sigh of relief when John Tatum graduates 
from Grossmont this year. 
Tatum drove in four of Grossmont's eight runs in the third inning with two 
homers, and the Foothillers went on to an 18-6 victory in a Grossmont 2-A 
League game Thursday at Santana. 
The victory broke a first-place league tie, leaving Grossmont (20-2, 3-0) on 
top by itself. Santana is 16-4 and 2-1. 
"I hate pitching to John," Saska said. "I don't know how to get him out. Throw 
him a curveball, and he'll bang it out that way. Throw him a fastball, and 
he'll bang it out this way. He's been tearing me up for two years." 
This was Tatum's second two-homer game of the season -- the first was against 
San Pasqual -- but he has never hit two in an inning. He added a two-run double 
to finish with six RBIs. 
Leading off the third, Tatum hit the first home run to tie it at 2-2. 
Jim Early reached first on a single. Rob Roberson reached first on a fielding 
error by right fielder Ferdi Hollis. Danny Lennon doubled, scoring Early. Mark 
Landers hit a two-run double, giving Grossmont a 5-2 lead. 
Grossmont then loaded the bases, and Todd Cady singled, scoring Landers. With 
runners on first and third and two outs, Tatum hit his second homer to make it 
9-2. 
"I wasn't thinking home run," Tatum said. "With two guys on, I just wanted to 
move somebody over." 
In the fourth, Kenny Ervin replaced Chad Barry on the mound for Santana. But he 
was subsequently replaced by Robert Ervin after walking three batters to load 
the bases. 
With Cady up, Lennon scored on a balk. Cady walked, and Tatum hit a two-run 
double that bounced over the fence. Cady went home on a passed ball by Lance 
McClure to make it 13-2. 
"We're not 12 runs better than Santana," Grossmont Coach Jeff Meredith said. 
"We know that, and they know that." LAURA PALMER
