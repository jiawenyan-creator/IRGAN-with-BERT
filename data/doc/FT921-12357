FT  27 JAN 92 / Observer: Poor taste
Accountants have a well-deserved reputation for abstemiousness, but lunch at
their Institute's restaurant on Friday seemed to be taking things too far.
My own table was the only one still occupied by 2.15pm.
There again, perhaps it is explained by the food. Arriving at 1pm, our party
of three was offered a selection of just four stale rolls from a basket. The
house white wine was finished, and the veal was also unavailable. It seems
Pru Leith is to take charge of the kitchens from the start of February.
Were the existing staff exacting revenge on the decision-makers who had axed
them, or simply acting like any good accountant and sensibly winding down
their stock?
