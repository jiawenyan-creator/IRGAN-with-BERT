FT  14 SEP 92 / Top pay 'unrelated to performance'
TOP directors' total pay is generally unrelated to their companies'
performances, according to a review published today by Incomes Data
Services, the research organisation.
The analysis considered total remuneration of the 69 highest-paid directors
in the country's largest FT-SE 100 companies with financial years ending
between September 1991 and March 1992.
Last week Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British
Industry, told the Trades Union Congress conference in Blackpool that senior
management's pay should be linked to the same market and productivity forces
as the rest of the workforce.
According to IDS, the median increase in annual total payments for the 69
highest-paid directors was 7.9 per cent. Total pay packages ranged from
Pounds 1,728,000 to Pounds 148,000.
As in the previous year, IDS said, there seemed to be no discernible
relationship between the earnings growth of individuals and the company
performance, although long-term incentive schemes had increased. Of the 26
companies whose profits and or earnings per share fell substantially, 23 of
the highest-paid directors received pay increases.
The review said some companies were now giving more information about the
make-up of remuneration at the top, reporting salaries and bonuses
separately, in line with the Cadbury committee's advice.
The Institute of Directors said last night: 'We have always said there is
nothing wrong with high pay as long as it is justified by performance and
you have to take into account both the performance of the company and the
individual and the degree of responsibility they take.
'If you want British industry to continue to attract the best people, you
have to reflect the level of pay abroad.'
