  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) chairman Tomiichi Murayama said early Tuesday [26 April] 
his party has decided to leave the ruling coalition, plunging 
Japan into further political confusion. The party's decision to 
quit the alliance means that when newly elected Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata forms a government it will not command a majority 
in the powerful House of Representatives. 
  Murayama revealed the decision in a statement released to 
reporters shortly after 1 A.M. [1600 GMT]. The decision 
followed the abrupt establishment of a new 130-legislator group 
by five blocs in the lower house which excludes the SDP after 
the Diet voted Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader Hata, 58, 
as new prime minister on Monday in place of Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  The SDP, which held six cabinet posts in the Hosokawa 
government, was the largest party in the coalition with 74 
members in the lower house.
