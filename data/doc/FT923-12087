FT  21 JUL 92 / Clowes granted leave to appeal
MR PETER CLOWES, founder of the collapsed Barlow Clowes financial empire,
has been given leave to challenge his convictions.
Permission to appeal was granted by a judge sitting in private who also
granted leave to Mr Peter Naylor, jailed for 18 months in connection with
the affair.
Mr Clowes, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, was jailed by an Old Bailey judge in
February for 18 offences of theft and making false statements involving
millions of pounds of investors' money.
The appeals will be heard in London later this year.
