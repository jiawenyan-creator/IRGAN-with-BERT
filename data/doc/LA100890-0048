ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; 
COVINA FIRM'S BID WINS STREET CONTRACT 
The Fullerton City Council has hired a Covina-based construction company to 
finish the Euclid Street improvement project. 
The council accepted the bid of $1.7 million by Aman Brothers Inc., which was 
16% higher than the city originally had estimated, but the lowest bid received. 
The $2-million project, between Malvern Avenue and Bastanchury Road, will add 
additional sidewalks and install left-turn lanes. The project is expected to be 
completed by summer of next year.
