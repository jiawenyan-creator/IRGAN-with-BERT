Due to the large differences between the SAI and Booz-Allen 
estimates, EPA requests comment on the appropriate inventory and 
methodology for calculating inventories to use. 

To calculate emission reductions (in tons), due to a 
regulatory program, it is necessary to first project an 
unregulated baseline into the future. EPA used two sources to 
estimate baseline locomotive emissions without FIP controls: 
Information from the Booz-Allen studies and information from the 
Association of American Railroads, (AAR). Booz-Allen developed 
emission inventory estimates based on locomotive application for 
the years 2000 and 2010. These estimates are illustrated in the 
following table.

The validity of Booz-Allen's estimates depends upon the 
accuracy of its baseline emission inventory work and the 
soundness of its growth projections. EPA has concerns regarding 
Booz-Allen's estimates of growth because they are based directly 
on 1987 data. Several developments in the rail industry since 
1987, however, could significantly affect growth projections, 
particularly in the South Coast. 

EPA therefore requests comment on two alternative methods 
for calculating growth based on national industry-wide averages. 
The first calculates growth based on historic trends in tons of 
freight originated and national locomotive fuel usage. The 
second estimate uses ton-miles and national locomotive fuel 
usage. Data used to construct these analyses came from 
Locomotive Facts, 1993 Edition, published by the Association of 
American Railroads. These estimates are summarized in the tables 
below. A complete description of the EPA methodology used to 
arrive at the figures used in this section is included in the EPA 
support document entitled: Baseline Locomotive Emissions for the 
Three California FIP areas.

(v) Aircraft and Airports.

For purposes of this NPRM, EPA relies on CARB's inventory 
for estimates of aircraft emissions. Emissions from mobile 
sources at airports also include ground access vehicles and 
airport ground service equipment. Ground access vehicle 
emissions are included in the overall FIP area numbers for on- 
highway vehicles described above in section (d)(1). Ground 
service equipment emissions are included in the overall FIP 
numbers for nonroad equipment described above in section 
(d)(3)(i). 

The work done specifically on airport control strategies for 
the FIP proposal uses more recent inventories based on research 
done by EEA with input from the airports and the local 
governments in 1993, and in the final rule the EPA may use an 
updated version of this EEA inventory. Comments are requested on 
the most appropriate inventory to use for aircraft and airport 
related emissions. 

(4) Mobile baseline inventory summary. The following tables summarize the baseline mobile source emissions in each
of the three FIP areas.
