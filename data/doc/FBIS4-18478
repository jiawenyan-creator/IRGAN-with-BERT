  [Text] Brussels, April 5 (AFP) -- The European Commission 
has decided to provide relief aid worth ECU13.5 million (15.39 
million dollars) for Burundi refugees, an EU [European Union] 
spokesman said Tuesday [5 April]. 
  The sum will be used to pay for medical and sanitation 
programmes in crowded refugee camps until around mid-June, the 
spokesman said. 
  Since the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye in 
October last year, tribal strife in the small Central African 
nation has claimed many thousands of lives and driven hundreds 
of thousands of people into exile. 
  The European Commission, exuctive arm of the European Union, 
estimates that Tanzania hosts 245,000 refugees from Burundi, 
Rwanda 273,000, and Zaire 41,000, most of them women and 
children. 
  The Commission has provided more than ECU40 million (45.6 
million dollars) in humanitarian assistance to refugees from 
Burundi and displaced people within the country since Ndadaye, 
the country's first elected Hutu president, was murdered by 
troops from the Tutsi-dominated army.
