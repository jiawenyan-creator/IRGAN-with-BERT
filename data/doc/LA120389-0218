FOR THE RECORD 
"The Mexican Muralists in the United State" (University of new Mexico Press) is 
available only in a hardback edition, contrary to an erroneous report in the 
Book Review last week that it was also available in paperback. The correct 
price of the hardback edition is $45, not $39.95, as reported.
