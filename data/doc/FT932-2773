FT  17 JUN 93 / Letter: ITV shareholder sees directors facing a conflict of
interests
Sir, This week the chairmen of 15 ITV companies have been busy lobbying the
heritage secretary for changes in the ITV network.
How many of the chairmen of the smaller companies - those that have been
putting the case against permitted takeover in their regions - have been
acting in the interests of their owners, as opposed to those of their
managements?
Directors have a duty to act in the interests of their shareholders. The
managements of these companies are ignoring a fundamental conflict of
interest between themselves and the owners - who are naturally interested in
maximising value. As the largest shareholder in one of them, Grampian
Television, I object to its directors lobbying against takeovers being
allowed by next door neighbours.
One chairman, Mr Louis Sherwood of HTV, says he is acting 'as a citizen'.
Shareholders in the ITV network in general and HTV in particular may feel
he, and others, have got their priorities wrong.
