FT  26 JUL 94 / British Museum in Pounds 110m appeal
The British Museum in London yesterday launched a Pounds 110m appeal to add
40 per cent more space for exhibits and improve access for its 7m visitors a
year.
Sir Norman Foster and Partners has been appointed as the consultant
architect for the project which should be completed by 2003, the museum's
250th anniversary. It is hoped that half the money will come from the
Millennium Commission, financed by the National Lottery. Sir Claus Moser,
chairman of the museum's development trust, is confident a matching sum can
be raised. The museum has already secured almost Pounds 10m.
The extra space will become available when the British Library moves out of
the museum to its site next to St Pancras station in north London. The Round
Reading Room, the heart of the library, was built in the 1840s in the centre
of the original great court of the museum. The architect plans to enclose
the inner courtyard with a roof, integrating it into the museum.
The reading room will be kept as a library open to the public but also to
scholars researching the museum's collection.
The new gallery space, which will cost about Pounds 55m to create, will
mainly be for the ethnographic collection, now housed at the Museum of
Mankind in Burlington Gardens, central London.
The museum's development trust faces two main problems. First, the new
British Library is still far from complete and there is no fixed date for
the transfer of books. Second, the Millennium Fund is designed to finance
new buildings and the museum will have to convince it that the proposals
amount to that.
The museum has already received Pounds 1m from the Korean government for a
new gallery of Korean art in an area previously used by the library.
