SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




Background



The Federal Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988 (16 U.S.C. 43014309; 102 Stat. 4546), hereafter referred
to as the ``Act'', seeks to secure, protect, and preserve significant caves on Federal lands for the perpetual use,
enjoyment, and benefit of all people. The Act also seeks to foster increased cooperation and exchange of information
between governmental authorities and those who utilize caves located on Federal lands for scientific, educational,
or recreational purposes. The Act requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue such regulations as he deems necessary
to achieve the purposes of the Act on National Forest System lands. The regulations are required to include, but need
not be limited to, criteria for the identification of significant caves.

On March 3, 1989, the Forest Service published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 inviting comments on what should be included in a proposed rule, and particularly requesting suggestions as to criteria
for identifying a significant cave. A total of nine comments were received in response to that notice: 4 from agencies
of State government, 2 from business entities, 2 from individuals, and 1 from a Federal agency.

Subsequently, a proposed rule was published on December 23, 1991 (56 FR 66388). The proposed rule described the process
the Forest Service would use in designating significant caves, provided for public nomination of caves, specified
six criteria by which a cave would be evaluated to determine whether it is significant, and identified the authorized
officer as the authority for designating and documenting a significant cave. The proposed rule also specified how
cave information and locations would be released. Lastly, the proposed rule revised certain prohibitions specific
to caves and cave resources. Seventy-six letters were received during the 90-day comment period in response to the
proposed rule: 30 from individuals, 18 from cave-related organizations, 16 from Federal agencies, 5 from natural
resource organizations, 4 from business entities, and 3 from State agencies.

All comments received are available for review in the Office of the Director, Recreation, Cultural Resources, and
Wilderness Management Staff, Auditors Building, 4th Floor, 201 14th Street, S.W. at Independence Ave., SW., Washington,
DC, during regular business hours (8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) Monday through Friday.



Analysis of Public Comment



Overall, almost all respondents were pleased that the Forest Service was promulgating regulations. Many offered
valuable suggestions for improving or clarifying specific sections. Some of these suggestions were group efforts,
using similar or identical language to identify and describe their interests, concerns, and recommended modifications
to the proposed rule. A few letters endorsed other respondents' statements.
