FT  18 APR 92 / Indian PM sees role of state 'tapering off'
INDIA'S Congress party wound up its conference at Tirupati with a
declaration from Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, that the state's
role in the economy should 'gradually taper off'.
He had earlier told delegates that there was 'no viable' alternative to the
pro-market policies the government had instituted. India could no longer be
proud of how the public sector was working. He said that the public sector
could not continue to syphon off resources from other sectors.
However, Mr Rao added that the state's role in providing economic welfare
should be enhanced. He pointed to the need to increase funds for primary
education and health.
During the three-day meeting, the government ran into far less flak from the
floor over the shift in economic policies than had been expected. The
leaders proposed a pledge of the party's continuing faith in socialism and
the Nehru model of a planned economy.
