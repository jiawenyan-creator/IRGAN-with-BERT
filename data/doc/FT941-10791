FT  08 FEB 94 / Merseyside reports static demand
Demand in domestic and export markets was at best flat in the fourth quarter
of last year, says the latest economic survey by Liverpool Chamber of
Commerce and Industry. Trends earlier in 1993 had been strongly upwards.
The survey covered 307 companies employing nearly 68,000 people in
Merseyside, north Wales and western parts of Lancashire and Cheshire.
Domestic deliveries weakened only slightly, but orders fell to their lowest
level of improvement for 1993. The balance figure of companies reporting
increases over decreases dropped to 10 percentage points, compared with 24
percentage points in the third quarter.
Export deliveries showed a similar decline to domestic orders. Export orders
fell to a positive balance of only 2 percentage points, the lowest since the
third quarter of 1992. Only 23 per cent of companies said orders from abroad
were up.
Improvements in the job market also appear to be faltering. A strong upward
trend last year saw 34 per cent take on workers in the fourth quarter
compared with 22 per cent cutting jobs. However, only 15 per cent plan to
recruit this quarter, while 34 per cent expect to employ fewer people.
Trends in cashflow remained strongly positive, with continuing optimism
about turnover and profits. There was also a marked increase in plant
utilisation in the fourth quarter, with 39 per cent operating at more than
80 per cent capacity.
Interest rates remained the biggest worry. But concern about prices of
supplies increased strongly, with 18 per cent of respondents worried about
them, compared with 9 per cent in the corresponding period of 1992.
