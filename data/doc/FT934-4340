FT  04 DEC 93 / Death of Escobar will hasten drug chiefs' surrender
THE death of Pablo Escobar, chief of the Medellin cartel, does not mean drug
trafficking has ended in Colombia, though it marks a big step forward,
President Cesar Gaviria said yesterday, Sarita Kendall reports from Bogota.
'The fight against terrorism has not finished, an enormous challenge lies
ahead,' he said.
But Escobar's killing in a big police raid should hasten surrender of rival
traffickers, and representatives of some of the top Cali smugglers, rivals
to the Medellin cartel, have apparently contacted the prosecutor general's
office to discuss terms. Legislation passed recently makes surrender more
attractive, with the possibility of minimal sentences under house arrest.
Escobar was buried yesterday at a chaotic funeral punctuated by the chants
of thousands of slum-dwelling mourners who considered him a Robin Hood
figure.
