FT  30 MAY 94 / The Markets: The fat lady has not sung - Global Investor
Election euphoria is waning in Italy and the Milan equities market, which
has far outperformed other leading European bourses this year, has been
falling steadily over the past two weeks.
Those clever enough to have taken profits at the top will have locked in
capital gains of almost 30 per cent since January 1 in local currency terms
and roughly 40 per cent in dollar terms. Even with the recent slide, the
market stands some 20 per cent higher in Lira terms than at the turn of the
year. So should investors sit tight in the hope of a rally, or lighten their
Italian exposure in expectation of a further decline?
Trans-European jitteriness apart, the main reason for the slide appears to
have been profit-taking by foreign investors, and a growing realisation
among domestic shareholders that the right-wing Berlusconi coalition has a
fragile majority and could face difficulties in producing a united policy
front.
More technical factors also seem to have played a role. On a price/earnings
basis the market looks highly valued, and it faces a series of heavy cash
calls, both from rights issues and the government's privatisation programme,
with the sale of Ina, the state-owned insurer, set for June 27.
Investors may have been selling shares to raise their cash levels in
preparation for Ina, and for tax payments which fall due around this time of
year, suggests Mr John Stewart at InterEuropa in Milan. The bull case for
the Italian market remains essentially intact. For all the Berlusconi
administration's potential weaknesses, there is no serious political
alternative.
Its free-market platform, promising fiscal austerity, accelerated
privatisation, a looser labour market and tax breaks for business, should
give additional impetus to what is shaping up as a strong cyclical upswing
in corporate profitability from 1995.
Equity prices should also be underpinned by falling fixed income yields,
provided the government fulfils its pledge to take firm action on the
gargantuan budget deficit and inflation falls, as expected, below 4 per
cent.
That said, the current correction may have some way to run. The market is
likely to remain edgy, and the lira under pressure, until Berlusconi gives
greater insight into his fiscal policies. The Comit index, which tested
support around 720 on Friday, could fall through 700 before finding solid
ground, but could then present a good buying opportunity.
Global telecoms
A week today the Dutch Government will announce the precise share price for
the flotation of KPN, the state-owned postal and telecommunications group.
With the prospective price/earnings ratio expected to be around 12, and the
yield about 4.5 per cent, the conservatively priced issue should fare
reasonably, provided the European market recovers its nerve.
But with a flood of other telecoms offerings in the pipeline, in both Europe
and Asia, the Dutch flotation raises the question of how investors can make
comparative global valuations in the sector. AT&amp;T, for example, is selling
on a prospective p/e of around 16 and a dividend yield of 2.5, Hong Kong
Telecom's p/e is 19 and its yield 3.4 and some Latin American and Asian
carriers have p/es in the 20s.
The most extreme disparities are due to the higher valuations the market
places on companies which represent pure plays in fast growing, riskier and
more lightly regulated telecommunication sectors, notably cellular, and the
more plodding performance to be expected from the established 'wireline'
operators.
Among the latter, differing valuations are due in large measure to
perceptions of national economic prospects, per capita wealth, teledensity
(number of telephone lines relative to population), political and currency
risk, and the quality of management.
Two other, relatively new factors need increasingly to be entered into the
valuation equation: the degree of local competition faced by the wireline
operator (high in the case of BT and AT&amp;T, low for KPN) and the extent to
which the company is involved in inter-active multi-media. Both are likely
to clip valuations - in the case of multi-media because of high initial
capital outlays and uncertain consumer demand.
None of these factors are sufficient on their own to explain the wide spread
of current valuations. For example, a recent study by Baring Securities
found a very weak correlation between p/e valuations around the world and
teledensity.
But in an attempt to create a more rational investment framework, Barings
has come up with a complex formula, factoring in potential expansion in GDP
per capita and teledensity, which ranks the world's telecoms companies by
growth opportunities over the next six years.
Not surprisingly, its top five (both mobile and wireline) are all in Asia:
Dai Ni Denden, the Japanese mobile company; Japan's NTT; Hong Kong Telecom
(on the assumption its territory will also embrace the mainland China
hinterland); Singapore Telecom and Korea Mobile.
However, many fund managers may be tempted to take the easy analytical
course and use telecoms stocks as a rough and ready proxy for a particular
national stock market.
Cable companies
The US cable television industry has been down in the dumps this past week.
Its annual conference in New Orleans was dominated by complaints about the
Federal Communications Commission, which insisted in February that the
industry cut the price of its basic service by 17 per cent - a ruling blamed
for scuppering at least two much-vaunted takeover deals between cable
companies and telephone operators.
But for shareholders there is a silver lining: the sharp fall in US cable
stock over the past three months means they are very cheap. Ms Jessica Reif
of Oppenheimer reckons that the largest US operator, Tele-Communications
Inc, is trading at around 6 times 1994 operating cash flow, adjusted for
debt and off-balance sheet assets.
At prices like this, the telephone companies may come calling again - though
probably on smaller players, rather than giants like TCI.
