WORLD; 
INDIA CUTS NEPAL OFF FROM WORLD 
Nepal's lifelines were almost completely cut today as India closed vital routes 
between the landlocked Himalayan nation and the rest of the world as part of a 
trade dispute. 
Trade and transit treaties between the countries expired Thursday with 
negotiations for renewal at an impasse. India, which blames Katmandu for the 
problem, today closed all but two of the 13 transit routes on their common 
border, Nepali officials said. 
Mountainous Nepal, sandwiched between India and China, relies on India for 
almost half its total imports and most essential commodities. Although Katmandu 
has said there are comfortable reserves of essential commodities, rationing of 
kerosene and other basics has already begun.
