FARWEST SAVINGS' PARENT IN RED 
The parent company of Newport Beach-based FarWest Savings on Friday reported a 
loss of $46.1 million for 1989, suffering from a $105.9-million decline in the 
value of its junk bonds. 
In the previous year, the company reported net earnings of $8.6 million. 
Losses at the thrift have continued into this year, and it now meets none of 
three federal standards on how much capital it must have. At the end of 1989, 
the savings institution had met one of the tests. 
FarWest officials said the thrift, owned by FarWest Financial Corp. of Los 
Angeles, is still solvent. They are talking with regulators about a plan to 
raise the thrift's level of capital, its final reserve against losses. The plan 
includes shrinking the firm, cutting costs and altering the S&amp;L's business 
focus. 
"In one way, this loss demonstrates the resiliency of the company," said 
Charles H. Green, the thrift's president. "To see that the company was able to 
absorb that hit and still meet one capital test shows the company's strength." 
The annual loss at the parent firm, which is controlled by the Belzberg family 
of Canada, also reflects a $45.1-million writedown in assets other than junk 
bonds. 
FarWest had about 14% of its assets in high-yield, high-risk corporate 
securities known as junk bonds when Congress passed a law in August to rescue 
the beleaguered thrift industry's deposit insurance system. The huge 
restructuring of the industry included a provision requiring thrifts to divest 
themselves of all junk bonds within five years. At the end of December, FarWest 
held about $535 million in junk bonds, or about 12% of its assets. 
Green said the thrift has reduced its assets to about $4 billion at the end of 
March from $4.3 billion three months earlier and a peak of $4.7 billion last 
summer.
