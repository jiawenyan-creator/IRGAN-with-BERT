FT  27 JUL 92 / International Company News: Greece sells shipyard for
Dollars 17m
CEDRIC Investments, a Greek shipping group, has agreed to buy Neorion
Shipyards, a state-owned yard on the Aegean island of Syros, for Dollars 17m
in cash.
The group, led by two Athens-based owners, Mr Panayotis Tsakos and Mr
Dimitrios Manios, undertook to retain the yard's 750-member workforce and to
invest Dollars 20m in new equipment.
Two other Greek groups and one US shipping company made bids for Neorion,
one of four loss-making Greek yards being sold off this year under the
government's privatisation programme.
The sale was arranged by the state-owned Hellenic Industrial Development
Bank (ETVA), the yard's main creditor. ETVA preferred to take an immediate
cash payment rather than accept Mr Tsakos's alternative offer of Dr6bn
(Dollars 31m) payable in instalments over 10 years.
Neorion, which specialises in repairs and conversions, reported losses of
Dr509m on turnover of Dr5.36bn in 1990, the most recent figures available.
The yard has accumulated debts of Dr16.3bn, mostly to state-owned banks.
