  [Text] Geneva, February 18 (TANJUG) -- A delegation of 
Belgrade doctors have warned representatives of international 
humanitarian organizations during a several days long visit to 
Geneva about the alarming effects of the United Nations (U.N.) 
sanctions on the health of the population and the over 700,000 
refugees in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  The doctors on Friday ended a visit to humanitarian 
organizations which operate within the U.N. system. Speaking at 
a press conference in Geneva, they underscored that the most 
elementary medicines and conditions for treating patients were 
lacking in hospitals in Yugoslavia because of the sanctions. 
  Head of Belgrade's neuro-psychiatry hospital Prvoslav 
Markovic warned that the admission of mental patients had 
increased four times in the past six months, and that, because 
of the sanctions, the genocidal conditions in the hospital wards 
were more devastating than the atom bomb which dropped on 
Hiroshima. 
  Dusan Velimirovic said that since the U.N. embargo was 
imposed, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had become a country 
with the biggest number of coronary seizures in the world 
because mortality in these cases had risen to 50 percent of all 
mortality rates. 
  Post-operative infections at the children's clinic in 
Belgrade have increased by 20-30 percent because there are no 
antibiotics, Dusan Scepmvic warned. 
  As a result of the shortage of cytostatics, the mortality of 
children with tumors has increased 40 percent, and operations 
are performed selectively, depending on the stages of the 
cancerous disease, Scepanovic said.
