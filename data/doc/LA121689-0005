LIFE OF A RAM FAN HAS UPS AND DOWNS 
Why am I a Ram fan? Roman Gabriel to Jack Snow. Why should I be a Dolphin fan? 
Bob Griese to Paul Warfield. Why am I a Ram fan? John Hadl to Harold Jackson. 
Why should I be a Cowboy fan? Roger Staubach to Drew Pearson. Why am I a Ram 
fan? Merlin Olsen and Fred Dryer. 
. . . And now why am I a Ram fan? Jim Everett to anybody. Why should I be a 
49er fan? Joe Montana to anybody. Why am I a Ram fan? Someday they will win a 
Super Bowl. Why should I be a 49er fan? They win Super Bowls. 
Why am I a Ram fan? Because I love roller-coaster rides? Because I am a 
masochist? Because they are underachievers, like me? Because I've lived here so 
long I bleed L.A. smog? No. 
I love the Rams because they are the epitome of the agony and the ecstasy -- 
always so close, yet so far away. 
Remember there's always next decade.
