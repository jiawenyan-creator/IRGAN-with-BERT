ACTION: 

Notice, adoption of final policy.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service is adopting revised policies and procedures for administering special use permits that authorize
privately owned recreation residences on National Forest System lands. This action is in response to an administrative
appeal decision by the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Natural Resources and Environment that found that
certain portions of the policy adopted on August 16, 1988, exceeded agency authority. The decision directed that
those portions of the policy be stayed from implementation pending reformulation and publication of a revised policy
in the 

Federal Register

. In addition to adopting new provisions affected by the appeal decision, this final policy also conforms administrative
provisions to revisions in the Secretary of Agriculture's Administrative Appeal regulations governing authorizations
for occupancy and use of National Forest System lands, adopted after the original recreation residence policy. This
final policy also clarifies the policy for determination of annual rental fees. The intended effect of this action
is to administer recreation residence authorizations consistent with statutory authority.

<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE: 

This policy is effective June 17, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 16, 1988, the Forest Service adopted a final policy and procedures for administering special use permits
that authorize privately-owned recreation residences on national Forest System lands (53 FR 30924). The policy
established a new procedure for calculating annual fees, gave direction on tenure and renewability of the permits,
and described procedures to be followed when the recreation residence lot was needed for a higher public purpose



This policy was appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture on September 15, 1988. The appellants alleged that the process
by which this policy was developed was flawed because the policy exceeded statutory limitations on recreation residence
use of the National Forests, and that the appellants and the public were adversely affected by the policy

In a decision dated February 15, 1989, the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Natural Resources and Environment
remanded the policy to the Forest Service for restudy and reformulation and stayed the implementation of certain
provisions of the 1988 policy as follows: (1) Those nonrenewal provisions relating to or requiring a showing of higher
public purpose where the lands occupied were deemed needed for other than recreation residences; (2) those provisions
requiring automatic permit renewal 10 years prior to expiration unless nonrenewal had been established; (3) those
provisions requiring the offering of ``in-lieu'' lots to permittees who had received notice of nonrenewal or termination;
and (4) those provisions weighted against consideration of commercial uses for lots when nonrenewal of the recreation
use was contemplated. Further, the decision expressed concern about other provisions of the policy, such as fee determination
procedures. In addition, the Assistant Secretary required that the remaining features of the final policy be designated
as interim policy pending its reformulation following all applicable process requirements.
