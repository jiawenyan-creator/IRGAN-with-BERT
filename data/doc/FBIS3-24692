  [Text] Kinshasa, 31 Jan (AFP) -- The World Bank has decided 
to close its office in Kinshasa as of February 1, a spokesman 
said Monday [31 January], saying that Zaire had been declared 
"insolvent." The decision will mean the cancellation of all 
outstanding credit lines. 
  The official said the French West African country's debt 
with 
the bank now stood at 45 million dollars. Financing had 
initially been suspended last July, when an envelope of the 
order of 170 million dollars was still available. The World 
Bank is involved in financing various projects in Zaire, notably 
in the sector of infrastructure and water-purifying. The 
official said a liaison office would remain in Kinshasa under 
the auspices of the United Nations Development Programme.
