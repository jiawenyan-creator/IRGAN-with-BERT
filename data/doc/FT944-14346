FT  24 OCT 94 / Receiverships 'staved off'
For every company which enters receivership nearly two others survive their
financial difficulties after the appointment of an investigating accountant,
a survey published today shows.
The Society of Practitioners in Insolvency said this meant that many more
companies were in a financial situation which seriously concerned their
banks than official receivership figures show.
Investigating accountants are paid by companies to look at the viability of
the business. Often banks request a company in which they have an interest
to call in the investigators.
Mr Ian Bradbery, president of the society, said that in 61 per cent of its
survey's cases investigating accountants recommended a solution other than
insolvency.
'It appears that our profession is quite independent enough to take a true
and fair view of a troubled business's prospects and that an investigating
accountant appointment is not the first step to receivership some have
suggested it to be,' he said.
The society also said its survey showed that when an investigating
accountant, after an initial investigation, later takes the receivership of
a company the business is more likely to be rescued. Only a fifth are broken
up after an investigating accountant has been appointed receiver.
