Landau 4-door sedan, the LeBaron 2-door coupe and the LeBaron convertible. NHTSA agrees that the LeBaron line should
be separated, but only into two lines. Since the 2-door coupe and the convertible are built on the same platform, the
agency considers the vehicles to be in the same line, the LeBaron Coupe/Convertible. The LeBaron 4-door sedan is in
a separate line, the LeBaron Sedan.

Chrysler also stated that the Chrysler New Yorker is more accurately listed as the ``New Yorker 5th Avenue/Imperial.''
Listing the 1990/91 New Yorker line as the New Yorker 5th Avenue/Imperial makes that line distinct from the LH series
New Yorker, that Chrysler introduced in model year 1994. NHTSA concurs with this comment.

Ford commented that only 16 percent of its model year 1990 and 1991 E150 light duty truck line had a gross vehicle weight
rating (GVWR) of 6,000 lbs. or less, and that model year 1996, each vehicle in its E150 line will be over 6,000 lbs. GVWR.
Thus, by model year 1996, that company's E150 light duty trucks will not meet the ACTA's definition of ``passenger
motor vehicle,'' since they will have a GVWR exceeding 6,000 pounds. Ford stated that it assumes that the effective
date of the parts marking standard for MPV's and LDT's will be no earlier than the 1996 model year and that, therefore,
it has concluded that no E150 vans will be subject to parts making. As discussed below, NHTSA has decided that manufacturers
of liens designated as high theft pursuant to the 1990/91 median theft rate must begin marking their vehicles in model
year 1996. The agency agrees that if the Ford E150 line does not fall within the statutory definition of ``passenger
motor vehicle,'' the vehicles are not subject to the theft prevention standard.

Mazda noted two errors concerning the listing of Mazda lines in Table III of the August 1993 

Federal Register

 document. As discussed above, Table III listed the previously designated high theft lines with theft rates that fell
below the preliminary median theft rate. The Mazda 323/Protege line was erroneously listed as a high theft line, and
the Mazda 929 was not listed. NHTSA has corrected the table for this document by removing the 323/Protege and including
the 929.

Volkswagen noted that Table III listed the ``Quattro,'' which that company assumed refers to the Audi V8 Quattro Sedan.
Since the line was determined by NHTSA to be likely low theft, Volkswagen asked that the line be removed from Table III.
NHTSA concurs that listing the ``Quattro'' in Table III was an error, and has removed it from the final data.

Commenters also identified several typographical errors in the theft data presented in the August 1993 document.
In light of those comments, the agency has corrected the theft rate for the Ford Tempo and Nissan NX Coupe, and the 1990
production number for the Suzuki Sidekick. NHTSA has also corrected production data for the Jetta line for model year
1991, based on Volkswagen's comment. Based on comments from Rolls-Royce, NHTSA added three Rolls-Royce lines. Two
Maserati lines were also added. No thefts were reported for any of the Rolls-Royce or Maserati lines in 1990 or 1991.
