  [Text] A group to defend Yemen's unity was formed in Sanaa 
yesterday on the initiative of a number of university 
professors. An informed source said this grouping, which has 
been called the "Popular Resistance" [al-muqawamah 
al-sha'biyah], will include hundreds of politicians from all 
trends, lawyers, doctors, and university professors, in addition 
to military commanders. The group calls for renouncing 
violence, rejecting division, and implementing the Amman 
document signed last month. 
  The source said the group will work among students and men 
of 
religion to organize popular resistance to face the possibility 
of war in the country. 
  Last Thursday, Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
called 
on Yemenis to wage a peaceful struggle to implement the Amman 
document.
