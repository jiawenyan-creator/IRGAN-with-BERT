FT  31 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Ms Garzarelli helps Dow to
another slide
Wall Street
US equities yesterday suffered their worst setback in a week of heavy
losses, as the sell-off in stocks triggered by February's shift in monetary
policy took on fresh intensity, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
In a highly volatile session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished
72.27, or nearly 2 per cent, down at 3,626.75. The fall brought the
bellwether index's net loss since March 22, the day the Fed lifted rates for
a second time, to 235 points. The Dow now stands at its lowest level since
November 4.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 6.93 lower at 445.55. New
York SE volume was very heavy at 390.5m shares and for a second day running
declines overwhelmed advances, by 2,040 to 350. The American SE composite
plunged 8.89, or 2 per cent, to 445.54, while the Nasdaq composite weakened
10.38 to 744.91 after dropping some 17 points the previous day.
From the opening bell, stocks came under fire as the bearishness that pushed
the blue chip index down 63 points on Tuesday showed no signs of
dissipating. The immediate catalyst yesterday was news that Ms Elaine
Garzarelli, a highly respected analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York, had
grown more pessimistic about the extent to which the market would fall from
its Dow Industrial peak of 3,978, reached at the end of January.
Ms Garzarelli said she believed the current slide in the Dow, at about 7 per
cent before yesterday's rout, may be only half over. The index could fall by
10 to 15 per cent before the correction ended, she said.
Her comments brought a quick response on the trading floor. Within an hour
the Dow plunged by as much as 54 points, triggering the NYSE's uptick rule,
which restricts program-guided sales.
However, investors were able to reverse the tide, and the blue chips worked
their way back to near opening levels by the early afternoon. But the market
soon changed course once again, partly in response to renewed weakness in
the bond market. The uptick rule then was reimposed, but failed to stop the
Dow from hitting its session low at the close.
Allied Signal dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 34 1/4 , Alcoa Dollars 2 7/8
to Dollars 71 3/4 , Chevron Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 83 3/4 and General
Electric Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 98 3/4 . IBM survived with a gain of
Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 53 1/2 and 3M edged Dollars  5/8 higher to Dollars
99.
Canada
Continuing interest rate fears and weak Canadian dollar and bond prices sent
Toronto stocks into a further sharp retreat, leaving the TSE 300 composite
index 79.70, or 1.81 per cent, lower at 4,313.9. Falls swamped rises by 659
to 228 after volume of 96.3m shares.
Brazil
Sao Paulo saw shares end 5.2 per cent higher following the overnight news
that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's finance minister, had officially
announced his presid-ential candidacy. The Bovespa index gained 748 at
15,156. Portfolio-squaring ahead of the end of the month also gave the
market some underpinning.
