FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Singapore group buys Wellington
tower block
HOTEL Grand Central, the Singapore-based group, yesterday announced the
purchase of one of Wellington's largest building complexes as it continues
to buy 'bargain priced buildings' in both Australia and New Zealand.
The company has spent NZDollars 27.20m (USDollars 15.1m) in buying three New
Zealand buildings in recent weeks, all well below official valuation
estimates. After announcing the purchase of Wellington's landmark Plimmer
City Centre for NZDollars 15.75m, the company immediately announced plans to
spend NZDollars 8m upgrading the 31-storey tower block which was the tallest
in the country until 1986.
In 1985, the complex was valued at NZDollars 95m, and the receivers, acting
on behalf of the Bank of New Zealand, turned down an offer of NZ48m for it
in 1990. It includes a 22-storey tower, a hotel and a car park building.
Only two floors of the office tower are occupied.
Hotel Grand Central owns hotels in Singapore and Malaysia and other office
blocks in north Sydney.
Last week, Hotel Grand Central announced the purchase of the 10-storey DB
Towers Building in Auckland for NZDollars 7.1m.
