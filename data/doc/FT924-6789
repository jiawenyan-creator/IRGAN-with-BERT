FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard tumbles 46% in
the fourth quarter
HEWLETT-PACKARD disapp-ointed Wall Street with a 46 per cent drop in
fourth-quarter earnings, after restructuring charges.
The US computer and electronics manufacturer said that it had been hit in
the quarter by pricing pressures, among other factors.
Fourth-quarter net earnings were Dollars 68m, or 28 cents a share, after
special charges of 36 cents.
For the same period last year H-P reported net earnings of Dollars 125m, or
50 cents after charges of about 40 cents a share.
The charges in both periods cover voluntary employee severance programmes,
relocations and consolidation of facilities.
Net revenue for the quarter rose 13 per cent to Dollars 4.3bn from Dollars
3.8bn. Net revenue in the US rose 9 per cent to Dollars 1.9bn, while
international sales were up 16 per cent at Dollars 2.4bn.
Mr Lewis Platt, who became H-P president and chief executive at the
beginning of the month, said: 'Our cost of sales grew more than revenue, and
we were unable to offset that increase by comparable reductions in our
operating-expense ratios'.
H-P said that its cost of sales rose by 1 per cent to 58.1 per cent of net
revenue, compared with the previous quarter.
The company listed pricing pressures, the cost of product transitions, an
increased proportion of sales through distributors, a continuing shift to
products with lower gross margins and costs of expanding its peripherals
operations as contributing factors.
Operating expenses rose 11 per cent, excluding special charges, over the
corresponding period of 1991.
Four percentage points of this increase were due to the impact of currency
fluctuations, H-P said.
For fiscal 1992, H-P's net revenue rose 13 per cent to Dollars 16.4bn from
Dollars 14.5bn in 1991. Net earnings for the year were Dollars 549m, down 27
per cent from Dollars 755m last year.
