  [Text] Tirana, April 29 (ATA) -- The Serbian Supreme Court 
will start a trial against 8 Albanians accused of "violation of 
territorial integrity" of the former Yugoslavia. The first 
trial of this political process was conducted in October 1992. 
It passed punishments ranging from 2.6 years of imprisonment 
although there were no proofs for the Albanian defendants. Such 
farces, which are now so common, are being organized in order to 
justify the state Serbian terror against the Albanians.
