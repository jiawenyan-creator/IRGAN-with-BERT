Test Methods and Measurements 
4.1General Service Fluorescent Lamps 
4.1.1The measurement procedure shall be as described in IES LM9, except as noted below. Lamps shall
be operated at the appropriate voltage and current conditions as described in ANSI C78.375 and ANSI C78.1, C78.2 or
C78.3. Lamps shall be operated using the appropriate reference ballast as described in ANSI C82.3. (See 430.22)

4.1.2Lamp lumen output (lumens) and lamp electrical power input (watts) at the reference condition shall
be measured and recorded. Lamp efficacy shall be determined by computing the ratio of the measured lamp lumen output
and lamp electrical power input at equilibrium for the reference condition. 
4.2General Service Incandescent Lamps 
4.2.1The measurement procedure shall be as described in IES LM45, except as noted below. Lamps shall
be operated at 120 volts and 60 hertz regardless of the rated lamp voltage. (See 430.22) 
4.2.2The test procedure shall follow section 7 and lamp lumen output determined in accordance with sections
4.2a or b of IES LM45 at the reference condition. Lamp electrical power input in watts shall also be measured
and recorded. Lamp efficacy shall be determined by computing the ratio of the measured lamp lumen output and lamp electrical
power input at equilibrium for the reference condition. The test report shall conform to section 8 of IES LM45.
(See 430.22) 
4.3Incandescent Reflector Lamps 
4.3.1The measurement procedure shall be as described in IES LM20, except as noted below. Lamps shall
be operated at 120 volts and 60 hertz regardless of the rated lamp voltage. (See 430.22) 
4.3.2Lamp intensity distribution shall be measured in accordance with section 6.0 and lamp lumen output,
or total flux, shall be determined in accordance with section 7.3 of IES LM20, at the reference condition. The
integrating sphere measurement method, section 7.1, shall not be used. Lamp electrical power input in watts shall
also be measured and recorded. (See 430.22) 
4.3.3Lamp efficacy shall be determined by computing the ratio of the measured lamp lumen output and lamp electrical
power input at equilibrium for the reference condition. The test report shall conform to section 10.0 of IES LM20.
(See 430.22) 
4.4Medium Base Compact Fluorescent Lamps 
4.4.1The measurement procedure shall be as described in IES LM66, as it pertains to lamps with integral
ballasts. Lamps shall be operated at 120 Volts and 60 Hertz. Lamp lumen output shall be measured according to section
11 of IES LM66 at the reference condition. Lamp electrical power input in watts shall also be measured and recorded.
(See 430.22) 
4.4.2Lamp efficacy shall be determined by computing the ratio of the measured lamp lumen output and lamp electrical
power input at equilibrium for the reference condition. The test report shall conform to section 13 of IES LM66.
(See 430.22) 
4.5Determination of Color Rendering Index (CRI) 
4.5.1The CRI shall be determined in accordance with the method specified in CIE Publication 13.2 for general
service fluorescent lamps. The required spectroradiometric measurement and characterization shall be conducted
in accordance with the methods given in IES LM58 and IES LM16. (See 430.22) 
4.5.2The test report shall include a description of the test conditions, equipment, and measured lamps,
spectroradiometric measurement results and CRI determination.
