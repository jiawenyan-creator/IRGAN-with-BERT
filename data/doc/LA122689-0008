LIFE SENTENCE 
The moral of the life sentence without possibility of parole given to the 
22-year-old with 5 1/2 ounces of crack seems clear (Part A, Dec. 7). Persons 
pursing criminal careers should, once they get two drug convictions, direct 
their efforts to more socially acceptable crimes, such as armed robbery or car 
theft. If this person had done either, he would be getting out in a few years.
