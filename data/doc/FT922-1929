FT  19 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): GPA, Maastricht add to
continental caution
GPA's aborted flotation and the Irish referendum on Maastricht took their
toll on bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. Frankfurt was closed
for a holiday.
AMSTERDAM saw Philips down another Fl 1.20 at Fl 29.90 following Wednesday's
profit warning with the shares expected to fall further today on the expiry
of options. Volume was estimated at some 4.5m shares, broadly the same as
the day before. The CBS Tendency index was 1.6 down at 125.8.
KLM's transatlantic price cuts on flights originating from the US sent the
shares lower. The airline was also rocked by speculation that a US airline
was about to file for bankruptcy: KLM has a 20 per cent stake in Northwest.
It closed down Fl 1.10 at Fl 38.10.
Some analysts said that the withdrawal of the GPA flotation would have less
effect on KLM than on Fokker, down Fl 1.30 or nearly 4 per cent at Fl 32.20
because of the latter's exposure to regional airlines which depend on
leasing finance.
Elsevier closed Fl 2.20 lower at Fl 107.50 on rumours that Mr Cornelis
Alberti, an executive director at Elsevier and tipped to become chairman,
was to resign.
PARIS ended lower after a volatile session as investors sold out, troubled
by weakness on other markets and Maastricht doubts. The CAC-40 index went as
low as 1,880.51 before closing 17.04 down at 1,891.80, its lowest close
since February 17. Turnover rose slightly to FFr2.7bn.
Michelin was one of the day's more prominent losers, falling FFr6.7 or 3.4
per cent to FFr193.3 ahead of its annual shareholders's meeting next
Thursday. Alcatel, another widely-held blue chip, lost FFr13 to FFr617.
Among smaller stocks, Hachette lost FFr3.4 to FFr128.7 in spite of the
company's forecast of a return to profit this year.
MILAN started about 0.5 per cent higher, following the favourable political
developments on Wednesday, but later came back slightly in view of the
weakness on foreign markets. The Comit index rose 2.1 to 471.79 in turnover
estimated at between L90bn-L95bn after L88bn on Wednesday.
Trading on the screen system was delayed by one hour due to problems with
the telephone lines linking the network. Sip was the most heavily traded on
the system, losing L73 to L1,278 in 7.02m shares, on fears that the
reorganisation of the sector would take longer than expected.
Weakness in the Italian bond market, following Wednesday's devaluation
fears, put pressure on the banking sector. Banca Commerciale fell L65 to
L2,955 and Credito Italiano lost L48 to L1,636.
ZURICH was relatively resilient, the SMI index closing 10.6 lower at 1,862.5
in moderate volume. Registered shares in Ciba-Geigy, SFr30 lower at
SFr3,280, topped the active list. Other chemicals were also lower with the
exemption of bearers in Merck which rose SFr18 to SFr696 on buying by one
small Zurich-based bank.
Swissair extended losses from midday to close SFr12 lower at SFr720. The
airline said on Wednesday that it planned to cut 400 of its 6,000
administrative jobs.
MADRID weakened in moderate volume, the general index losing 1.55 to 246.51.
Rumours that the chemicals group Ercros may file for bankruptcy drove the
shares down Pta33 or 15 per cent to Pta189.
STOCKHOLM fell ahead of the midsummer holiday today. The Affarsvarlden
General index fell 14.40 to 928.90 in moderate turnover of SKr430m, of which
trading in Astra accounted for SKr90m, as yesterday was the final day for
trade in Astra restricted shares. All Astra shares will be unrestricted from
Monday.
OSLO suffered its 13th consecutive decline, depressed by falls on the
foreign exchanges. The all-share index dropped 6.51 to 417.28 in trading
worth NKr250m.
Norsk Hydro shed NKr2.50 to NKr162. UNI Storebrand, which asked the
government for permission to hold its 28 per cent stake in the Swedish
insurer Skandia beyond June 30, saw its A shares drop NKr3 to NKr39.
COPENHAGEN moved against the trend, the KFX index closing 0.29 higher at
89.03 after a modest recovery by bank and insurance shares.
The insurer, Hafnia, in deep trouble because of unrealised losses on its
large stakes in Baltica and Skandia, saw its A rise DKr12 to DKr142, mainly
because of the rise in value of its 33.5 per cent stake in Baltica, whose
shares rose DKr20 to DKr460.
Danske Bank and Unidanmark edged up in quiet trading, mainly because the
domestic bond market stabilised.
HELSINKI's banks were another story. Free shares in KOP, one of Finland's
largest banks, fell FM1.2 to FM8 as the Hex index closed 17.7, or 2.2 per
cent lower at 769.2, although traders said that trading was extremely thin.
ISTANBUL jumped by 2.7 per cent with the 75-share index closing up 95.52 at
3,614.54, its highest level for over a month. Turnover was estimated at
TL205.7bn from TL144.8bn.
