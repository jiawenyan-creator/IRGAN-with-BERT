  [Excerpt] After a meeting this morning of the Croatian 
Democratic Union [HDZ] deputies club, chaired by President 
Franjo Tudjman, and a meeting of opposition leaders, a session 
of the Parliament's House of Counties began in the early hours 
of the afternoon. It was adjourned around 1800. The 
parliamentary crisis does not seem to have been overcome despite 
an agreement among the parliamentary parties on the distribution 
of the key positions in the parliament. 
  [Correspondent] Josip Manolic was relieved of duty in a 
relatively swift and painless manner and the HDZ's Katica 
Ivanisevic was elected to take over his position. However, the 
crisis was reopened during the voting by 68 deputies present at 
the session, when Josip Manolic got 33 out of the 35 votes 
needed to be elected third deputy speaker in the chamber of 
counties. Such an outcome of the vote demonstrates a failure by 
the HDZ to respect the interparty agreement, according to the 
opposition. It leads to a parliamentary crisis, Mestrovic said.
