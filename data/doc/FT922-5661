FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Tokyo banks agree rescue of
Taiheiyo
SAKURA Bank, the large Japanese bank, is leading a rescue of Taiheiyo Bank,
a medium-sized Tokyo-based bank which ran into trouble three years ago with
loans to a property developer.
Sakura will put up around 30 per cent of low-interest loans totalling Y110bn
(Dollars 846m) to be made to Taiheiyo over 10 years. The rest of the funding
will be extended by Fuji Bank, Tokai Bank and Sanwa Bank.
Executives from Sakura and from the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of
Finance will be transferred to Taiheiyo to supervise the bank's
rehabilitation.
The rescue is a classic example of a bail-out of a Japanese financial
institution, with banks and the authorities working together to prevent a
bankruptcy.
The fact that the rescue has taken three years to arrange is a measure of
the difficulty the banks faced in forging a burden-sharing agreement.
Taiheiyo ran into trouble by lending to Mogami Kosan, a property speculating
company, which accumulated around Y100bn in bad and doubtful loans.
