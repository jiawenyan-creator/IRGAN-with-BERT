FT  02 SEP 93 / Sharp fall in union support for Smith
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, has suffered a sharp decline in popularity
among Britain's trade union leaders, a poll published today in New Statesman
and Society shows.
Both former leader Mr Neil Kinnock and Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport
spokesman, are rated more highly than Mr Smith.
Since last year's poll Mr Smith has seen a 20 per cent fall in his rating.
His performance achieves a score of 6.3 out of 10 this year compared with
7.8 last year. This is lower than that of Mr Kinnock during his final year
as party leader. By contrast Mr Prescott's popularity among union leaders
has soared - taking him from eighth to first place in the shadow cabinet
popularity table with a score of 6.7 out of 10.
Modernisers Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, and Mr Tony Blair, the
shadow home secretary, have both suffered declines in their ratings.
Only 55 per cent of union leaders say they would like to see the abolition
of the union block vote at the party conference, down from 61 per cent last
year.
The survey was based on 51 completed questionnaires from among 120 trade
union general secretaries.
