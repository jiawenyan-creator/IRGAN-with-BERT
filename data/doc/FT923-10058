Petroleum
SAGA PETROLEUM, Norway's biggest independent oil company, yesterday
disclosed a weaker half-year operating profit due to lower crude oil prices,
writes Karen Fossli.
Group operating profit fell by NKr85m to NKr593m (Dollars 104m) but profit
before extraordinary items rose by NKr86m to NKr440m.
Nevertheless, operating revenue rose to NKr2.473bn from NKr2.074bn.
