FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Eli Lilly details plan for
non-core sell-off
Eli Lilly has given details of plans to shed its non-pharmaceuticals
businesses, including an initial public offering later this year for a new
medical devices company with sales of Dollars 800m.
In January, the US drugs company indicated it planned to group six of its
devices businesses into a single company for sale.
Under the plan announced yesterday, one of these six businesses, Ivac, would
be sold separately.
Lilly said this was because the company operated in a different market to
the others, and would benefit more from being bought by another company.
It said it was in talks for the sale of the business, but refused to name a
potential buyer.
The remaining five businesses, all of which operate in the area of
cardiovascular or minimally invasive systems, will be floated in the fourth
quarter of this year, Lilly said.
The aim is to sell 20 per cent of the shares in this new company, to be
known as Guidant, with the remain-ing shares being distributed to Lilly
shareholders within the following six months.
This would either be done by issuing shares in the new company to existing
Lilly shareholders, or allowing Lilly shareholders to exchange some of their
shares for shares in the new company.
