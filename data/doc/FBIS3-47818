  [By Cha Man-sun from Vienna] 
  [Text] A third round of working-level contacts between the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea ended 
in a stalemate due to the two sides' differences in their basic 
position over general inspections [chonmyon sachal] of seven 
nuclear facilities in North Korea. 
  The IAEA and North Korea, at the third round of contacts 
held 
yesterday afternoon, discussed for three hours the issue of 
resuming inspections by reviewing Pyongyang's response to the 
IAEA demands. However, they failed to reach a consensus. 
  The IAEA, after having reviewed the North Korean 
authorities' 
response with the North Korean delegates, disclosed that North 
Korea had not signaled any green light to the IAEA demands, 
hinting that Pyongyang's response was a negative one.
