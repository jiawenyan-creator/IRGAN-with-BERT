  [Text] Tokyo, Feb 23 KYODO -- Isuzu Motors Ltd. said 
Wednesday [23 February] it has developed an environment-friendly 
engine device for large commuter buses that automatically stops 
the engine when the bus halts at a bus stop or for a red light. 
  Isuzu said it is the first Japanese maker to develop such a 
device, called an idling-stop-and-start system. 
  The system stops the engine when the driver stops the bus 
and 
shifts the gear into neutral and frees the clutch pedal. It 
starts the engine again automatically when the driver steps on 
the clutch. 
  Isuzu said the system can reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 
nearly 10 percent when running in urban areas and improve fuel 
efficiency by about 10 percent. 
  The system will be available from April 5 for 350,000 yen, 
the company said.
