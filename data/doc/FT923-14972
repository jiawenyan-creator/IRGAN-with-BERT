FT  04 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: FNFC
It is difficult to evaluate First National Finance Corporation's assertion
that default rates on its consumer loan book are improving when this side of
the business required a further Pounds 36m provision in the first half. The
company told a similar story when it announced its full year results in
January. Now it says the latest provision, which admittedly is below that in
the second half of 1990-91, was necessary because of the lag before lower
default rates work through.
One has to hope that the impact will be felt soon. Next spring, FNFC faces
debt maturities of some Pounds 250m. Its bankers will surely look askance if
there is not some more tangible sign of improvement. The chances are that
the company will be thrown back on further securitisation of its loan
portfolio. Whether it will then be able to retain the bulk of its customary
10 per cent margin is another matter. It cannot look forward to much extra
volume in consumer lending, while losses on commercial lending look set to
continue. If past recessions are anything to go by, small business borrowers
will remain under strain even after the upturn begins. Recovery looks as
remote as ever, and for FNFC the delay is becoming uncomfortable.
