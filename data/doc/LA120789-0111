RIO HONDO SEEKS PROBE OF 'HIT' LETTER AGAINST SOLIS 
Rio Hondo College officials have asked five government agencies to help them 
find out who sent a bogus "hit" letter, typed on college stationery, to 
district voters just days before the Nov. 7 trustees election. 
The letter, written by a group claiming to be the "staff committee for ethical 
elections," sharply criticized board President Hilda Solis, who was up for 
reelection against candidates David Flores and Elizabeth Van Note. Solis won 
with 45.7% of the vote. 
The letter said: "We the faculty of Rio Hondo are concerned about ethical 
practices being conducted as a part of the election of your representative to 
the Board of Trustees." The letter went on to accuse Solis of living outside 
the district, associating with an accused child molester and supporting college 
liberals who want a large pay raise for the faculty. Solis says the allegations 
are false and defamatory. 
College officials say they are upset because the letter was written on college 
stationery by a group that does not exist, and falsely gave the impression that 
it was official college business. 
Tim Wood, vice president of administrative affairs, said the college has asked 
the state attorney general's office, the Los Angeles County Grand Jury, the 
state Fair Political Practices Commission, the U.S. Postal Service fraud 
division and the Los Angeles County district attorney's office to help 
investigate. College officials say they have few leads.
