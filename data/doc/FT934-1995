FT  16 DEC 93 / Sick-pay bill clears Commons
The Statutory Sick Pay Bill completed its Commons passage early this
morning. The government's hotly disputed guillotine on the measure, which
will scrap the scheme under which the state reimburses companies for 80 per
cent of sick pay, limited debate to a total of six hours.
The bill gained its third reading by 298 votes to 204, a government majority
of 94, and now goes to the Lords.
