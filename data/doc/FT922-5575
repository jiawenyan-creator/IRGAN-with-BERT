FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Amoco forced to scale back
capital spending
AMOCO, the US oil and gas company suffering from reduced profit margins, has
become the latest energy group to scale back its planned 1992 capital and
exploration spending.
The company said it would cut 1992 spending by 12 per cent, from Dollars
3.7bn to Dollars 3.26bn. The scheduled 1992 budget was already lower than
the Dollars 4.16bn allocated last year.
Amoco has also told its 54,000 employees it may seek some job cuts later
this year.
Like Mobil, Texaco and other US energy groups, Amoco is feeling the effects
of a weak US economy, low energy prices, and lower demand for a range of it
petroleum products.
The US energy sector is generally seeking ways to reduce overheads, through
redundancies, plant closures, deferred project investments and immediate
cuts in capital expenditure.
Amoco's decision to cut spending comes in the wake of a 52.4 per cent drop
in its first-quarter net earnings, to Dollars 234m. Earnings at most US oil
and gas companies are expected to continue to decline during the second
quarter of 1992.
