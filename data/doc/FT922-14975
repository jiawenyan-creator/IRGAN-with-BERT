FT  03 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lead smelter set to close after
350 dismissals
SOCIEDAD Minera y Metalurgica de Penarroya, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Franco-German multinational Metaleurop, said yesterday that it had dismissed
350 workers at the Santa Lucia smelter in Cartagena.
Penarroya is expected to shut the 90,000 tonne primary lead smelter, the
company's only industrial asset, within two months.
The lead works recently filed for temporary receivership. The company said
adverse economic and financial conditions as well as local political and
environmental factors had forced the smelter's closure.
