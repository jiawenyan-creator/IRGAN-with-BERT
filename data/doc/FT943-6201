FT  31 AUG 94 / Changes in tax 'aid the childless'
Families with children have been the main losers from changes in the UK tax
system since 1985, say researchers from the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
An analysis of the changes, published today in the institute's journal
Fiscal Studies, says single people, pensioners and couples with no children
are largely better off as a result of the changes. Couples with children and
single-parent families are more likely to be worse off than to have gained.
On average earners with children gained from the changes by Pounds 6 a week
for households with one earner. However, more than two out of three such
households were worse off, since all the gains went to a minority.
Families have been particularly hard hit by the imposition of value added
tax on domestic fuel and the reduction in mortgage interest tax relief, the
institute says.
Pensioners have done better than average because of the compensation package
for VAT on fuel they will receive through the social security system. They
are also less likely to use tobacco and petrol, on which excise duties have
risen steeply in real terms since 1985.
The article by Mr Chris Giles and Mr Paul Johnson compares the effects of
the tax system as it will be in 1995 with the tax system as it was in 1985
updated to reflect price inflation since then. The figures are calculated
using a representative sample of the UK population to model the tax changes.
The changes have made the richest 60 per cent of households better off and
the poorest 40 per cent worse off, the article says. Three-quarters of the
money spent on tax cuts since 1985 has gone to the richest 10 per cent.
The tax system in 1995 will be much less progressive than it was 10 years
earlier, the IFS says. This is partly because of the shift from direct taxes
such as income tax to indirect taxes such as VAT and excise duties.
Indirect taxes are particularly regressive, the IFS says. The richest tenth
of households pay 8 per cent of their income in such taxes, while the
poorest tenth pay 20 per cent.
The changes since 1985 have increased the after-tax income of the top tenth
by 5.8 per cent and reduced those of the bottom tenth by 2.9 per cent.
