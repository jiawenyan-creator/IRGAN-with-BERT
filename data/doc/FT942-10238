FT  11 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cyprus rebids for Chilean
copper
Cyprus Amax, the US mining group, showed it was still interested buying 51
per cent of El Abra in Chile, one of the world's biggest undeveloped copper
deposits, by delivering a revised offer to Codelco of Chile six days ahead
of the May 15 deadline.
No details were given of the revised terms. Cyprus and its partner Lac
Minerals of Canada asked for changes after tests showed the copper content
of the El Abra ore was lower than suggested by Codelco's test work. Lac
recently said it would hand its share of the project to Cyprus, if the new
offer was accepted.
Codelco's board will consider the new offer on May 18. It has said that it
will call another international tender if the bid fails to meet
requirements. Two of the world's biggest mining groups, BHP of Australia and
RTZ of the UK, which lost to Cyprus in the first tender, have indicated they
may rebid.
