MORE LEGISLATORS IN S. CAROLINA INDICTED BY U.S. 
A federal grand jury on Friday indicted five more legislators on charges 
involving bribery and drugs, bringing to 10 the number of lawmakers charged as 
a result of an FBI investigation of the South Carolina Statehouse. 
In addition, a registered lobbyist was indicted on a drug possession charge. 
The indictments grew out of an FBI investigation into vote-buying in the South 
Carolina General Assembly. Of five legislators charged in August, three have 
pleaded guilty. 
The indictments are beginning to raise questions at the Statehouse about the 
impact of the investigation on black lawmakers. Four of the 10 legislators who 
have been indicted are black. There are 19 black legislators in the 170-member 
General Assembly. 
The legislators charged Friday with violating the Hobbs Act, a federal bribery 
law, were Reps. Thomas Limehouse, Ennis Fant, Larry Blanding and B. J. Gordon. 
All but Limehouse are black. 
In addition, Rep. Donna A. Moss was charged with misdemeanor cocaine 
possession. She resigned her seat Friday. 
House Speaker Bob Sheheen suspended the indicted lawmakers, which is required 
by House rules. 
Limehouse, 31, was charged in a three-count indictment with two violations of 
the Hobbs Act. He was accused of accepting $2,000 from Ron Cobb, a lobbyist who 
worked undercover for the FBI in the sting operation known as Operation Lost 
Trust. 
Limehouse was also charged with conspiracy to solicit bribes and obstruction of 
justice. 
Fant, 29, Blanding, 37, and Gordon, 57, were charged together in one count of 
conspiracy to violate the Hobbs Act. Each was charged separately with accepting 
bribes. 
Violations of the Hobbs Act carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a 
$250,000 fine. 
Moss, 36, is charged with possession of cocaine during the 1989 legislative 
session. 
Also charged was lobbyist James Madison Brown V, on one count of misdemeanor 
possession of marijuana in September, 1989.
