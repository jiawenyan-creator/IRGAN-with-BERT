FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Tandy to buy back 12m shares in
Dutch auction
TANDY, the US electronic products retailer, is to repurchase 12m shares, or
16 per cent of its outstanding shares, through a Dutch auction, AP-DJ
reports.
Shareholders will be invited to tender shares at prices not greater than
Dollars 32 nor less that Dollars 27 a share, and to specify at which price
they wish to tender.
Tandy will purchase 12m shares at a price within that range. The offer will
not be conditional on a minimum number of shares being tendered. The tender
offer will expire March 26 unless extended by Tandy.
The company said proceeds from the recent preferred equity redemption
cumulative stock (Percs) issue would be used to fund the repurchase.
The company said it was making the offer because it believed that, given
Tandy's business, assets and prospects and the current market price of the
shares, the purchase was an attractive investment.
