FT  01 JAN 94 / Yeltsin pledges help for ethnic Russians
President Boris Yeltsin pledged yesterday to defend the interests of Russian
citizens living outside Russia more energetically in 1994, Reuter reports
from Moscow.
In a televised new year address he said: 'We were and will be together. We
are defending and will defend your and our common interests.'
In Estonia and Latvia, which Moscow accuses of discriminating against
Russians, many Russian-speakers have retained Russian citizenship.
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the extreme nationalist whose party performed
strongly in last month's elections, has urged stouter defence of Russians
living in the other independent states.
