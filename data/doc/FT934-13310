FT  22 OCT 93 / People: City Solicitor to investigate complaints against
accountants
Matthew Ives is to become director of the professional conduct department at
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
Ives, 45, will take over the position from Brian Harris, QC, who is to
retire on January 4 next year.
His appointment comes at a time when the institute has been under criticism
for failing to act sufficiently quickly and harshly against accountants who
transgress.
He takes over a department that has grown in size from 12 to 40 staff in the
past eight years, and  - like other professional bodies  - is handling a
growing number of complaints  - currently standing at about 3,300 a year.
Ives is currently City Solicitor and Secretary to the City of Westminster in
London. He has worked in Westminster since 1982, and was previously with the
London Borough of Waltham Forest and the London Borough of Haringey.
He stressed yesterday that it was too early to suggest any changes to the
organisation of the department but emphasised the need to balance the
interests of the complainant against the interests of justice.
Andrew Colquhoun, secretary and chief executive of the institute, says that
Ives' work with local authorities had 'sufficient analogies' with his new
regulatory role to make him well suited for the post.
Harris will continue as secretary to the executive committee of the Joint
Disciplinary Scheme, which investigates high profile public interest cases
on behalf of the accountancy profession, such as Barlow Clowes, Maxwell and
BCCI.
