arbitrage selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index closed down 49.36 to 16,287.45, moving between a low of

arbitrageurs finally overcame small-lot public buying.

Individual investors sold speculative theme stocks on concerns about a
mounting overhang of margin positions. Many investors, who sought theme
stocks in September, face margin settlements in March. Green Cross, the

Other pharmaceutical issues were also dragged down, with Takeda Chemical
down Y10 to Y1,240 and Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical falling Y30 to Y2,420.
Sony rallied on small-lot buying in the morning session on reports that it
would increase production of the mini-disc, its next-generation audio
system, due to increased demand. However, Sony finally closed down Y20 at
Y4,090 on profit-taking. Pioneer Electronic, which lost ground last week on
reports of a downwards revision of earnings by a local broker, fell a
further Y20 to Y2,350.
Other high-technology issues declined on selling by tokkin, or specified
money trusts. Hitachi retreated Y12 to Y693, falling below Y700 for the
first time since November last year. NEC fell Y21 to Y610 on earnings
concerns as the company plans to join the low price personal computer
market, competing against US companies.
