MORNING REPORT: MOVIES 
Four people in Angers, France, have been given short, suspended sentences and 
fines of $7,500 each for attacking a theater showing "The Last Temptation of 
Christ." They were convicted of throwing tear gas bombs and pouring acid on 
seats last fall at a movie theater in Angers, which is about 180 miles 
southwest of Paris. Theaters throughout France were attacked during showings of 
director Martin Scorsese's film, and French fundamentalist Roman Catholics 
condemned the movie as sacrilegious and disrespectful in its depiction of Jesus 
Christ. ALEENE MacMINN and SHAUNA SNOW
