TV REVIEWS; 
'PIECE OF CAKE': HISTORY WITH THE BLEMISHES 
"The game's afoot," entones Squadron Leader Rex, shoulders back, head high, 
teeth clenched, upper lip stiff. "The struggle is becoming more arduous. 
Now is the time to stand shoulder to shoulder. Let us close ranks and show the 
Boche what we're made of." 
His flock of Spitfires swoops off the green fields of France and into the 
blazing sky to engage the Heinkels and Messerschmitts. It all smells of romance 
and easy victory. 
The title of "Piece of Cake," a six-part miniseries commencing Sunday night on 
"Masterpiece Theatre" (9 p.m. Channels 28 and 15; 8 p.m. Channels 50 and 24), 
suggests grand tales of the RAF in WWII, as seen through the bright eyes and 
gun-sights of Hornet Squadron, 1939-40. 
But the title is full of cynical ironies, as related by Derek Robinson in his 
sometimes grim novel about the myth of the RAF flyboys during the Big One. They 
were in his reality a twisted mix of fresh and frightened lads, some 
embittered, some brash, and no amount of fervent oratory by Squadron Leader Rex 
could itself win the day. Bloody lessons had to be learned. 
(The day eventually is won and glory affirmed, but the series drew bitter 
hostility from legions in England who would prefer history without blemish.) 
"Piece of Cake," adapted by Leon Griffiths and directed by Ian Toynton, 
creates, then kills, some memorable men. Aerial scenes are easy and beguiling, 
although the gunfights are flat. Of course, how wonderful need the killing be? 
The point is easily made. IRV LETOFSKY
