FT  10 APR 93 / Group 4 loses third prisoner
BRITAIN'S first private prisoner escort service on Thursday experienced its
third escape within a week, Robert Taylor writes.
A 20-year-old man facing traffic charges in Derby escaped by breaking out of
the van taking him to court.
Group 4 Escort Services started work last week on a five-year contract
covering the east midlands, south and north Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and
Humberside. Mr David Evans, general secretary of the Prison Officers
Association, yesterday predicted further escapes: 'This recurring nightmare
will go on as long as this government continues with its dogmatic policy of
contracting out prison escorting.'
The prison service, which is monitoring Group 4's operation, acknowledged
'significant difficulties' and said it would be discussing the problems with
Group 4 next week.
The company said that 'initial difficulties' could be expected. 'Our
procedures and our vehicles are entirely to the satisfaction of the Home
Office who also set the standards for the prison service.'
