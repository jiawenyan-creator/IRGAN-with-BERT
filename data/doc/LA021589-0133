CENSUS BUREAU SEEKS ACCORD WITH MINORITIES 
City officials and community leaders met with a U.S. Census Bureau 
representative Tuesday to get ideas for reaching out to minority communities to 
ensure a more accurate count in the 1990 census, especially among Latino and 
Asian residents. 
Peter Bounpane, assistant director of the U.S. Census Bureau, made the one-day 
visit at the request of Santa Ana City Councilman Miguel A. Pulido, who said 
the city's population has changed since 1980. 
Pulido said Santa Ana's 1980 census figure of 225,000 is believed to be about 
50,000 to 75,000 short of the city's actual population. Although there is no 
official evidence supporting this view, Pulido said the estimates have come 
mostly through police observations. 
Census figures are used in determining federal and state funding and the number 
of legislative representatives. According to Pulido, an additional 50,000 
people in the 1990 census could mean an increase of as much as $5 million 
annually in revenues for the city. 
But Jill Arthur, a legislative aide for the city, said many people, especially 
illegal aliens, are afraid to fill out the census questionnaire, fearing 
trouble with other government agencies. 
Through census fairs and public service announcements, Arthur said, the city 
wants to teach the growing Latino and Asian communities the benefits of an 
accurate census and to assure people that any information given to the Census 
Bureau is confidential.
