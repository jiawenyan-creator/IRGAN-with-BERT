FT  28 JAN 92 / Letter: A perverted logic that cheerfully awaits the
financial worst
Sir, BCCI, Polly Peck, Maxwell. Now the British are expecting the worst from
the single minded Mr Tiny Rowland. The ingredients are already there:
dividend cut, stock price collapse, stock exchange inquiry, 'foreign' chief
executive.
I hope Lonrho is different. Only a week ago the FT was quoting some analysts
as saying that Lonrho should cut its dividend if it was prudent, but with
others saying that they did not expect Mr Rowland to do so because he was a
'contrarian' out to prove he is different from the rest.
Now everyone is up in arms about his dividend cut. What kind of perverted
logic is this? This 'crisis' is caused by the financial industry, which has
fallen into its own psychological trap. What causes a lender to say: 'We
have got to put on our thinking caps to work out why he cut the dividend'?
It seems that the lender has not done its homework and has no idea why it
lent money in the first place.
I would not be surprised if the drop in the share price caused some of
Lonrho's now alarmed lenders to withdraw some of their credit facilities,
thus causing a real crisis. I hope that the FT does not become party to this
mind-twisting game by quoting an increasing number of worried people. I feel
very much reminded of a London storm causing little actual damage but
paralysing the whole city because everyone stops work to stand by the window
and cheerfully wait for something awful to happen. Gerrit Jacobsen,
