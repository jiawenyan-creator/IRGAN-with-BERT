FT  25 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada to resume wheat sales to
Russia
CANADIAN wheat shipments to Russia will resume shortly, the Canadian Wheat
Board says, after assurances of payment by the Russians.
The board halted shipments a week ago, saying Russia had exceeded a CDollars
1.5bn (650m) Canadian line of credit by CDollars 100m.
Now the board says a 'modest' interim payment has been received and the
Russians have provided a plan to deal with payment arrears. Russia is in the
first year of a five year contract to buy 25m tonnes of Canadian wheat worth
CDollars 3.5bn at current prices.
Statistics Canada says Canadian farmers planted much more wheat this year
but the harvest will be far from a record. Because of cool wet weather
output is estimated at 29.9m tonnes for 1992, down 6 per cent from 1991.
Oats production will be up sharply and barley down. The estimates are in
line with those of the private United Grain Growers as of the end of July.
The grain harvest of the Commonwealth of Independent States will rise to
175m tonnes in 1992, from 154.7m in 1991, the Interfax news agency said,
citing figures from the CIS statistics office, reports Reuter from Moscow.
On Friday, President Boris Yeltsin said Russia's grain harvest was forecast
at 103m tonnes in 1992, after 89.1m tonnes in 1991.
'US experts say the harvest will be 98m tonnes, we say it will be 103m,' Mr
Yeltsin told a news conference. Previous forecasts have put the 1992 Russian
harvest at about 98m tonnes although some predictions put it as low as 93m.
Drought has cut yields sharply in many parts of Russia.
Ukraine officials recently forecast a total grain harvest of 43m tonnes, 5m
more than last year.
