FT  26 APR 91 / Rise in French unemployment
FRENCH unemployment grew sharply last month, from 2,587,200 in February to
2,603,100 in March. This takes the unemployment rate to 9.3 per cent, an
increase of 0.1 per cent each month since December, writes Ian Davidson in
Paris.
Meanwhile, the National Statistics Institute revised its inflation-adjusted
estimate for the fall in fourth quarter 1990 gross domestic product (GDP) to
0.2 per cent from the 0.4 per cent estimated in February.
The French government is planning to freeze government spending next year.
For the first time for several years there will be no reduction in the
nominal budget deficit.
