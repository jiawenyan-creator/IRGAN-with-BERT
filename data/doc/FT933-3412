FT  14 SEP 93 / Bankers welcome Lloyd's guide for raising corporate capital
CORPORATE financiers seeking to persuade institutions and individuals to
invest in Lloyd's yesterday welcomed the publication of a new guide for
corporate investors, increasing hopes that the insurance market can attract
fresh capital next year.
The Lloyd's guide outlines the terms on which corporate members with limited
liability will be able to trade at the market. Final approval of the scheme,
originally mooted 18 months ago, depends on a vote by Names, the individuals
whose assets support the market, at an extraordinary general meeting on
October 20.
Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, said existing Names would not be
'squeezed out' by corporate capital, arguing that new corporate money would
compensate for a decline in commitments by existing Names after losses of
more than Pounds 6bn in the past five years.
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, said corporate investors would bring
new confidence and security to the market.
Based on a draft circulated in July, the guide contains few surprises for
bankers, who are working on a variety of investment trust and investment
company schemes to support syndicates.
It states that corporate members must have minimum net assets of Pounds 1.5m
and must deposit an amount equal to 50 per cent of their capacity (the
amount of premium they are allowed to underwrite) with Lloyd's.
Syndicates would normally be allowed to obtain no more than 50 per cent of
their capacity from corporate members, and no more than 25 per cent from one
corporate member alone.
Sir Laurie Magnus, director and head of corporate finance at Samuel Montagu,
the merchant bank, which with James Capel is aiming to raise up to Pounds
250m to support a range of Lloyd's syndicates, said the guide was 'along the
right lines. We're reasonably confident'. Mr Marty Dolan, part of the
corporate finance team at Salomon Brothers, said: 'The rules look good
although they require detailed study.'
However, bankers cautioned that success was not guaranteed. 'Our
institutions are quite excited but they will want to see the small print,'
said Sir Laurie.
