FT  26 APR 94 / World Trade News: Sutherland rules out WTO role
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, confirmed yesterday he would not be a candidate to head the new
World Trade Organisation due to succeed Gatt next year.
The announcement, in a statement issued from Gatt headquarters in Geneva,
came as no surprise. Mr Sutherland, a former Irish attorney-general and EU
competition commissioner, was pressed to take the Gatt job last year to see
the Uruguay Round of trade talks to a successful conclusion. But, that
mission achieved, he has made clear for some time that he wished to rejoin
his family in Dublin.
Mr Sutherland, 48 yesterday, was chairman of Allied Irish Banks, Ireland's
biggest bank, before going to Geneva.
