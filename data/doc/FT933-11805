FT  28 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Trade marathon gets second wind
THE four-way tariff-cutting deal at the Tokyo summit earlier this month has
succeeded in reanimating the Uruguay Round of global trade talks in Geneva.
However, real negotiations will not begin until the autumn, trade officials
said yesterday.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, will use today's meeting of the overseer Trade Negotiations
Committee to set out 'mile posts' for the negotiations in the next three
months, to ensure no momentum is lost.
The 116-nation Round, already three years' overdue, must conclude by
December 15 when the US administration's negotiating authority expires.
The past two weeks have been taken up mainly with clarification of the
accord reached on July 7 by the 'Quad' nations (the US, European Community,
Japan and Canada), to eliminate or slash tariffs on 18 categories of
manufactured goods and make progress on liberalisation of trade in services.
Line-by-line details of the accord became available only at the end of last
week.
Quad negotiators have been explaining the deal's implications for third
countries, and they and other participants have put down markers for
bargaining on market access for manufactures, farm products and services.
However, exporters of farm goods have been disappointed by the slow start to
bargaining on measures to open the market for agriculture, where the EC in
particular has not been ready to negotiate. Agricultural products were not
covered by the Tokyo agreement.
The hope is that, after consultations with governments, negotiators will
return to Geneva at the end of August ready to deal across the whole range
of market access issues. They must also tackle outstanding differences in
the Uruguay Round draft rules package, where the US has raised a host of
objections covering, among others, anti-dumping, textiles, intellectual
property, and the creation of a powerful multilateral trade organisation.
