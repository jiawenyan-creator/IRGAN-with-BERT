FT  08 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Warning to young
entrepreneurs - In a Nutshell
T-shirt printing and car valeting services should be avoided by young people
starting their own business, according to a survey by the Prince's Youth
Business Trust in the West Midlands.
Jewellery making, floristry and horticulture are more rewarding sectors,
according to the trust, which helps disadvantaged 18-25-year-olds into
business. Only 17 per cent of T-shirt printers and 20 per cent of car
valeting businesses backed by the trust have survived. But all the florists
and horticulturists it backed and 78 per cent of jewellery makers are still
in business.
