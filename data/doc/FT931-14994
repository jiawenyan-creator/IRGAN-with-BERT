FT  15 JAN 93 / PIA doubts on tougher rules
THE BOARD of the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), the proposed
self-regulatory body for retail financial services, is being urged by some
of its members to reject a regulator's request that it adopt much tougher
rules.
The PIA board had been told by Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities
and Investments Board, that it will not be approved as a self-regulatory
body unless it tightens up its rules, particularly those relating to
independent financial advisers.
PIA board members said they had been advised by several representatives of
independent financial advisers to write to Mr Large warning that his
proposals for the investment authority could not be achieved.
The board is to meet again on February 9 to discuss how to respond to Mr
Large. It is expected that board members will ask Mr Large to clarify some
of the points in his letter.
In particular, members will be asking whether the SIB is urging that
building societies, most of which sell the insurance products of a single,
separate company, be encouraged to join the new body.
Sir Gordon Downey, chairman of the PIA board, said yesterday that the letter
from Mr Large had forced the board to extend the timetable for implementing
the new authority.
'The views expressed in the SIB letter will of course be taken into account
by the Personal Investment Authority in the continuing development of its
prospectus,' Sir Gordon said in a statement.
Privately, several board members expressed grave doubts that Fimbra members
would vote to approve a PIA along the lines of that demanded by Mr Large.
