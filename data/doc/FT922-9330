FT  08 MAY 92 / Letter: The roots of US racial problems
Sir, Edward Mortimer's reflections in 'Nations in glass houses' (May 6) are
correct insofar as they admonish Europeans to refrain from smugness
regarding their own race relations, as compared to those in the US, but dead
wrong in seeking the roots of the evil.
A simple explanation of social and economic data will confirm that what had
been a transient economic underclass - that is, a class of people both poor
and uneducated but from which it was possible to rise - became a permanent
underclass as a direct consequence of the social assistance programmes of
Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, programmes which made it economically
rewarding to do nothing about one's own circumstances. Nor ought this to be
a revelation, for Europe's social democracies are achieving the identical
result, the creation of a permanent underclass through social assistance.
The blacks in this underclass in the US today are held far more firmly in
bondage, a cruel bondage of good intentions, that they ever were in steel
chains, which only required physical escape.
The new Simon Legrees are the social welfare architects who have pandered to
generation after generation of American blacks, destroying the family,
pardoning any behaviour with excuses, and destroying any incentive for
self-improvement. If black rage were properly directed, it would be at the
hand which pretends to help.
