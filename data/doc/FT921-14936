FT  14 JAN 92 / Power station contract awarded
THAMES Power, the independent power generator, has awarded a Pounds 370m
turnkey contract for its 1000MW power station at Barking Reach, east London,
to a consortium of Balfour Beatty Projects &amp; Engineering and GEC Alsthom
Power Plants.
Balfour Beatty is part of BICC, the construction and enginnering group that
jointly owns Thames Power with Canadian Utilities, a susidiary of Atco of
Canada.
The new station will use modern 'combined cycle' gas-fired technology, which
has become increasingly popular since electricity privatisation because it
is cleaner and more efficient than coal-fired generation.
It will include five 123MW gas turbines built by European Gas Turbines,
another subsidiary of GEC Althsom. It is the sixth UK combined-cycle
contract for the Anglo-French engineering group in little more than a year.
Work will begin in July, and is scheduled to take three years.
