AGENT, SUSPECT WOUNDED DURING SHOOTOUT AT PARK 
A drug bust erupted into gunfire Thursday night at Golden Hill Park, leaving a 
federal agent hospitalized and his assailant in serious condition with wounds 
to the neck and leg. 
Two other men were arrested during the alleged drug deal and shooting, which 
surprised and startled park visitors. 
The incident occurred about 6 p.m. when Tony Campbell, an undercover Drug 
Enforcement Agent, exchanged money for 20 ounces of heroin allegedly sold by 
Miguel Angel Flores-Palbar, 21, and Jesus Alberto Gutierrez-Corrales, 29, both 
of Culiacan, Mexico. 
Campbell, working with a multiagency anti-drug task force, then gave the arrest 
signal to his colleagues, according to Charles Hill, special agent-in-charge of 
the DEA's San Diego office. But a lookout for the alleged drug dealers, Luciano 
Pulido-Barela, believed to be 36, saw what was happening, pulled out a 
.45-caliber handgun and, according to Hill, shot Campbell in the chest from 15 
to 20 feet away. 
The bullet, however, was deflected by Campbell's bulletproof vest. Knocked down 
by the impact, Campbell got up and began chasing Pulido through the park, which 
is located at 25th and A streets. He was joined by other agents of the task 
force, made up of DEA, U.S. Customs, Border Patrol and California Highway 
Patrol officers, Hill said. 
Several bystanders in the park witnessed the chase, and their presence caused 
the agents to withhold their gunfire, Hill said, but Pulido continued firing at 
the officers as he fled. When they were clear of the park-goers, the agents 
fired at Pulido, hitting him in the neck and leg.
