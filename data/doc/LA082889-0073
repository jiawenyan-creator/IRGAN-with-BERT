ICN Joins China Venture: ICN Pharmaceuticals said it has signed a letter of 
intent to enter into a joint venture with the China National Medical Corp. to 
build and operate a drug-manufacturing plant in Shanghai. The joint venture 
between ICN and the Chinese government-owned company is valued at up to $25 
million. Panic said the project has the blessing of Chinese Premier Li Peng, 
who met with him and the project's prospective bankers earlier this week. Under 
the tentative agreement, a factory designed by ICN and built by the Chinese 
will produce the ICN drug Ribavirin.
