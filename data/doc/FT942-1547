FT  23 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Builders strong
There was a positive tone again evident in the construction and building
materials sector, with the good news flow continuing. Construction group YJ
Lovell said price levels in the residential sector were showing an upward
trend and sales incentives were being steadily reduced as it reported an
interim loss of Pounds 1.13m, against Pounds 3.93m in the previous year. The
shares slipped 3 to 83p.
There were also encouraging words from John Laing as it announced a Pounds
72.5m property deal. The shares rose 13 to 287p. The building group said it
believed prices for new houses in the UK had stabilised and Laing Homes was
beginning to see some price increases in the south east.
Elsewhere, Beazer Homes added 5 at 147p, Taylor Woodrow 9 at 133p, Barratt 6
at 201p - with NatWest Securities said to be positive on the latter two -
and Berkeley Group 7 at 403p. Among materials suppliers, Caradon gained 13
at 293p, BPB Industries 10 at 292p, Blue Circle - being recommended by
Panmure Gordon - 16 at 285p and RMC 19 at 828p.
News that Singapore Airlines had placed a firm order for 10 of the Airbus
A340-300 aircraft and also 20 options helped British Aerospace firm 4 to
465p. The company builds the wings of the aircraft and is a 20 per cent
stakeholder in the Airbus consortium.
Sentiment was further boosted by reports that BAe has renewed talks with
Taiwan Aerospace Corporation over a joint venture to produce regional
aircraft. Overseas interest in the stock continues and the group said
foreign holdings in the company stood at 28.7 per cent, just shy of the 29.5
per cent permitted under the company's articles of association.
The engine order for the new Singapore Airlines aircraft went to US group
Pratt &amp; Whitney, dampening sentiment in Rolls-Royce. The latter eased 1 1/2
to 182p in trade of 5.4m, with reports of a delayed order from Malaysia also
hurting the stock.
Conglomerate Tomkins edged a penny forward to 224p, with Smith New Court
reported to be recommending the shares.
A stock overhang in engineering group GKN, which returned to the list of
FT-SE 100 companies this week, saw the shares relinquish 7 to 574p. The
stock was initially hit by vague talk of a profits downgrading.
Royal Bank of Scotland trod water as the bank said there were no strategic
implications over what it would do with the cash raised from the sale of its
7.3 per cent stake in venture capital group 3i, which was floated yesterday.
Royal Bank shares closed steady at 428p. The offer of Pounds 711m of equity
in 3i was 1.7 times oversubscribed and the shares will be placed with
institutions at 272p each, a 13.5 per cent discount to net asset value.
Lloyds Bank slipped 1 1/2 to 548p as Smith New Court turned seller and cut
its current year forecast by Pounds 150m to Pounds 1.1bn. Mr Richard Coleman
of Smith's banking team said: 'Even if they get Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, it
does not transform Lloyds into a high growth dynamic stock.'
Chemicals group ICI jumped 17 1/2 to 756p in response to a positive
presentation by the company to analysts and subsequent recommendations. ICI
said that conditions in its Tioxide subsidiary were improving. Many brokers
were recommending the shares, including Smith New Court, UBS and Kleinwort
Benson.
BAT Industries fell sharply in early dealing as the market digested news
that its Brown &amp; Jackson unit in the US had sneaked through a high nicotine
tobacco and used it in some cigarettes. However, the shares recovered later
to close barely changed at 390 1/2 p.
Mildly disappointing results from First Leisure was the signal for a
sell-off in the shares, which finished the session 19 off at 289p, although
turnover was a measley 380,000. Analysts lowered their full-year profits
forecasts by around 5 per cent, representing largely the fall in margins in
the ten-pin bowling division.
Relief over the result of the George Michael versus Sony court case lifted
Thorn EMI, with investors likely to be further heartened by the publication
of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's report into compact disc prices,
due today. The commission is widely expected to exonerate the record
companies, although retailers are thought more likely to come in for some
muted criticism. Thorn gained 11 at 1045p.
Drinks shares were subdued, although Guinness managed a rise of 5 to 453p on
reports of a five-fold increase in Guinness sales due to the soccer World
Cup, as well as a Bell's whisky presentation to analysts.
Good results from Carpet- right could not stop the shares from being subject
to profit-taking and they retreated 6 1/2 to 249 1/2 p.
Freight group NFC continued to be powered by a James Capel buy
recommendation issued on Tuesday. The shares added 3 1/2 at 190 1/2 p. The
company said after the market closed that it is to terminate plans for a
scrip dividend in respect of the first interim dividend for the year
1993/94.
