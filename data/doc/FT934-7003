FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: Navan seeks to re-open Bulgarian
mine
Navan Resources, a small Dublin-quoted company, is to raise IPounds 7m
(Pounds 6.6m) via a placing to cover the cost of a 40 per cent stake in the
Chelopech mine in Bulgaria which the company says produced 45,000 troy
ounces of gold and 8.8m lbs of copper annually during the 1980s.
Navan also claims that the Chelopech ore body contains 5.4m ounces of gold
and is one of the largest gold resources in Europe.
The mine was closed by the new democratic government in April 1991 because
of unacceptably high levels of arsenic in the copper concentrate (an
intermediate material) sold to the nearby smelter at Pirdop.
Navan says it has been able to earn a 25 per cent interest in the mine by
demonstrating to the Bulgarian authorities that these environmental problems
can be overcome.
A joint venture company, Bimac, with an authorised capital of 1bn Bulgarian
lev (about Pounds 24.8m) has been established to operate the mine and
associated facilities. But it will not inherit past liabilities of any kind.
Navan will inject about Pounds 2.6m) into Bimac and directly own 40 per
cent. It has the right to take its stake to 68 per cent. The Pounds 2.6m
will be used to bring the mine back into production in 1994.
