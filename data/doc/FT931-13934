FT  21 JAN 93 / Health scheme cost put at Pounds 198m
THE capital costs of restructuring medical education and research under the
government's Tomlinson report recommendations for London healthcare would be
Pounds 146m to Pounds 198m, says a study by KPMG Management Consulting.
The report, commissioned by London University, says these costs could not be
offset by revenue from the sale of university surplus property and existing
capital grants. 'Even at the lower end of the projected range of costs there
is a substantial shortfall.' Assuming property sales were successful, the
report puts the university's net capital costs at Pounds 70m to Pounds 140m.
Opponents of the Tomlinson recommendations to close or reorganise a number
of London hospitals will be heartened by the report.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, is due to make decisions on
the report early next month. She is under pressure from some parliamentary
colleagues to tread cautiously in spite of earlier declarations by health
ministers that radical action was required to tackle the capital's
healthcare problems.
Professor Sir Colin Dollery, pro vice-chancellor for medicine at London
University, said yesterday the KPMG report identified a 'desperate need' for
substantial extra capital grant even if only part of the Tomlinson
recommendations were implemented.
KPMG says it has 'erred on the side of underestimating' the likely capital
costs for the university. Some elements of KPMG's cost estimates were
unacceptable to the medical schools involved. If their views were accepted,
costs would increase significantly.
University property disposals might, says the report, raise Pounds 45m to
Pounds 55m. 'However, it should be stressed that realising these values will
depend on the university's ability to sell medical school property.'
