  [Text] Havana, March 24 (KCNA) -- The decision of the U.S. 
imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique to deploy 
Patriot missiles in South Korea and resume the Team Spirit 
nuclear war game is an open challenge to the 70 million Koreans 
desirous of a peaceful reunification of the country, said Kim 
Chang-su, deputy head of the mission of the South Korean 
National Democratic Front [SKNDF] in Cuba, in a press interview 
today. 
  He denounced the U.S. imperialists for making a fuss over 
the 
fictitious "nuclear issue" of the North. 
  He said: "Pressure and threat cannot defeat justice. The 
United States must not forget that it was Korea where it drank 
the bitter cup of its first defeat".
