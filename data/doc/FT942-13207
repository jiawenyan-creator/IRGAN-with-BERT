FT  26 APR 94 / UK Company News: Sykes-Pickavant
Sykes-Pickavant Group, the USM-quoted engineering products distributor,
reported profits of Pounds 305,000 pre-tax for 1993, against Pounds 118,000.
The comparative figure was restated for FRS 3 and struck after operating
losses of Pounds 511,000 on discontinued activities.
Turnover fell from Pounds 18.7m to Pounds 18.2m, with higher exports partly
making up for lower domestic sales, resulting from the postponement of smoke
meter tests by the Vehicle Inspectorate and computer problems.
Earnings per share were 1.98p (1.02p). A final dividend of 1.33p is
recommended for a total of 2.66p (4p).
