FT  07 NOV 94 / International Company News: Better margins boost NZ group
Strong growth from its Australian white goods division helped Fisher and
Paykel boost after-tax profits by 82 per cent to NZDollars 19.4m (USDollars
12m) in the six months to September 30. Sales rose by 20.8 per cent to
NZDollars 381m.
Sir Colin Maiden, the chairman, said that the increase was largely due to
improved profit margins. Margins also improved in the healthcare and
Panasonic divisions.
Overseas sales rose by 35 per cent to NZDollars 160m, and now represent 44
per cent of trading revenue, up from 39 per cent last year.
Australian white goods sales were up 47 per cent to NZDollars 104m,
representing a growth in market share in all categories.
Increased production also lifted sales to Asia, where the company has
developed products suited to the climate. New Zealand sales rose by 11 per
cent to NZDollars 91m, and Panasonic division sales by 8 per cent to
NZDollars 73.8m.
The interim dividend is up by one cent to nine cents.
