FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Strong recovery at Navistar
surprises Wall St
Navistar International, the Chicago-based truck and diesel engine
manufacturer, posted a turnround to income of Dollars 22m or 28 cents a
share for the fourth quarter. The extent of the improvement surprised Wall
Street, which had pushed Navistar's stock down in anticipation of a weak
earnings report.
The gain reverses a Dollars 30m or Dollars 1.46 per share loss in the fourth
quarter of 1992, when the company took a charge of Dollars 23m for a vehicle
recall.
Sales for the quarter were up 14 per cent to Dollars 1.3bn, boosted by an 18
per cent gain in shipments of mid-range diesel engines and a 13 per cent
increase in shipments of medium and heavy trucks in North America.
A year ago, Navistar recorded fourth quarter sales of Dollars 1.1bn.
For the year ended October 30, Navistar reported a net loss of Dollars 501m
or Dollars 15.19 per share. The loss includes a previously announced Dollars
513m contribution to an employee benefits programme, established in the
third quarter to alleviate Navistar's long-term pension and health-care
obliga-tions.
In the fiscal year 1992, Navistar suffered a loss of Dollars 212m, or
Dollars 9.55 per share.
Excluding the special charges, Navistar reported pre-tax income of Dollars
72m for the year, compared with a loss of Dollars 145m from continuing
operations in 1992.
Navistar's sales for the year were up 21 per cent at Dollars 4.69bn, from
Dollars 3.87bn a year ago.
Mr James Cotting, Navistar's chairman, said the company anticipates moderate
growth in the North American economy. He projected 1994 North American
medium truck and school bus chassis demand to be up 11 per cent over 1993,
at 136,000 units, while heavy truck and diesel engine sales were expected to
be flat in 1994.
