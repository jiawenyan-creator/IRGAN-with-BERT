  [Text] The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has 
approved salary adjustments for members of the National 
Peacekeeping Force. Salaries will range from 10,500 rands a 
month for a brigadier to 2,300 rands for a private. Members of 
the force who have been seconded will be paid directly by their 
units. 
  Meanwhile the TEC's subcommittee on defense has said a 
number 
of other issues, including living conditions and training, still 
have to be addressed.
