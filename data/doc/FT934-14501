FT  16 OCT 93 / Advisers warm to Lloyd's trusts
LEADING independent financial advisers, who guide the portfolios of wealthy
investors, seem to be taking a positive attitude towards the new investment
trusts being formed to provide corporate capital for Lloyd's.
The insurance market is hoping that its Names - the individuals whose assets
support the market - will want to invite corporate members to join the
market next week at an extraordinary meeting.
Merchant banks and Lloyd's agents have already issued pathfinder propectuses
in preparation for flotation of four new investment trusts, all of which
would seek backing from individual as well as institutional investors.
At least 12 other similar schemes are at an advanced stage. Lloyd's is
expecting between Pounds 500m and Pounds 1bn in corporate capital to join
the market next year.
Financial advisers, who will help market these schemes to individuals, have
mixed views but some have already decided to recommend that their clients
buy shares in the trusts.
'We all think it is very exciting,' said Mr Mark Bolland, an adviser with
Chamberlain de Broe, a London-based adviser that offers a fee-based service
for the better-off.
He added: 'To be able to go into these markets with a complete floor on
losses may well be attractive.'
Mr Clive Scott-Hopkins of Towry Law, one of the country's biggests advisers,
is another enthusiast. 'One should recognise that the market is on the
recovery and rates are moving up very considerably,' said Mr Scott-Hopkins.
'It ought to do well over the next two to three years.'
Individuals with Pounds 1,000 to invest should be able to buy shares in the
trusts, while wealthier investors can make a minimum Pounds 20,000
investment in those parts of the trusts that are placed privately.
Investors in the new schemes - like Lloyd's Names - will earn a return both
from investment and from underwriting profits. Money raised by the trusts
will be invested in a range of gilts and equities but will also be used to
support underwriting by Lloyd's syndicates. For every Pounds 1 in corporate
capital backing, syndicates can underwrite Pounds 2 in premium income.
However, unlike Lloyd's Names, the new investment trusts will have limited
liability for losses. If underwriting syndicates crash, as many have done
over the past five years, investors will simply lose the amount of capital
they have committed. Lloyd's Names have unlimited liability for losses and
can theoretically be pursued by creditors for their entire personal wealth.
Mr Scott-Hopkins said the new schemes were the 'best of both worlds. You
have limited liability and very considerable gearing'.
'The worst that could happen is that you could lose your Pounds 10,000. In
practical terms that is not likely now that Lloyd's has put its house in
order,' he added.
Other financial advisers have doubts. Mr Jeremy Evans of Chantrey Vellacott
said his company was taking a 'wait and see attitude. To a great extent it
very much depends what happens over the next 12 months. I'm not totally
convinced it will be as profitable as everyone says.'
Mr Stephen Lansdown of Hargreaves Lansdown says his firm cannot decide
whether to recommend the plans. 'We may be obliged to take these to our
clients. But I am suspicious. They are complicated vehicles. Emerging
markets are a dream compared to these. I can talk about Chile and Argentina
until the cows come home. But Lloyd's underwriters . . . ?'
Some advisers remain firmly opposed. 'I can see no evidence that their
losses are going to end,' said Mr Robert Boyton, of Boyton Financial
Services. 'There is no track record on which I can make a recommendation to
my clients. I'm very much a contrarian but what concerns me with them is
that they have not reached the bottom of the cycle.'
