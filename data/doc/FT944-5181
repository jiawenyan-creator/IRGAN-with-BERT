FT  05 DEC 94 / Company News (This Week): Analysts still focus on GUS cash
pile - Other companies
Great Universal Stores, the mail order, retailing, financial services and
property group, is expected on Thursday to announce an 8 per cent increase
in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 213.2m to about Pounds 230m.
Attention will again focus on the secretive group's Pounds 1.5bn cash pile,
with last month's share buy-back by Boots, the chemists and retailing group,
having rekindled speculation that GUS might make a similar move. Most
analysts believe a buy-back unlikely, but wonder whether GUS has other plans
for its cash.
