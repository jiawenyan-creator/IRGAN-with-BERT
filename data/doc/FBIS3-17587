  [Text] Moscow, 25 Mar -- Yuriy Baturin, the Russian 
president's national security assistant, and Sergey Stepashin, 
the director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
resolutely opposed publications about an alleged coup plot in 
Russia at a news conference held at the Lubyanka [former 
premises of KGB] today. 
  They said that it was wholly a matter for the consciences of 
the authors of the articles and the competent sources whom they 
cited how substantiated these publications were.
