FT  22 JUN 92 / About 4,500 Lloyd's Names face average Pounds 100,000 losses
ABOUT 4,500 Lloyd's Names face average losses of more than Pounds 100,000
each for 1989, it emerged yesterday following the first official
confirmation that the insurance market lost Pounds 2bn in that year.
Unaudited figures confirm that losses are heavily concentrated among a
minority of Names - the individuals whose assets provide Lloyd's with its
capital base. Audited final figures are expected at Lloyd's annual general
meeting on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, reacted strongly to a
move by disgruntled Names to force an extraordinary general meeting and a
no-confidence vote in the governing council.
He said the actions risked 'damaging Lloyd's worldwide business'. The
council's policies were directed to protecting policyholders, and were in
the interests of all members.
It also emerged yesterday that Lloyd's authorities could be seeking as much
as Pounds 50m from brokers and agents to boost funds providing 'hardship'
relief for Names facing ruin.
The Pounds 2bn loss for the market as a whole compares with a deficit of
Pounds 510m in 1988, the first time Lloyd's had been in the red for 20
years. It reflects the impact of disasters such as hurricane Hugo, which
devastated the Caribbean in September 1989.
The latest loss comprises a Pounds 1.4bn loss on the 1989 year, the transfer
of Pounds 400m to reserves to cover claims emerging from business
underwritten in previous years and Pounds 200m for Names' personal expenses.
More than 4,300 of the 31,329 Names made losses equal to 30 per cent or more
of their premium income limits (the amount of premium Names are allowed to
receive according to Lloyd's rules). With this limit amounting to an average
of Pounds 350,000 in 1989, the indications are that these members - about 14
per cent of the market's membership - have lost more than Pounds 100,000
each.
The losses of syndicates managed by two agencies - Gooda Walker and Feltrim
 -totalled Pounds 602m, while five syndicates - numbers 255, 290, 298, 540
and 847 - registered losses of Pounds 560m.
The impact of the losses is certain to increase the number of Names seeking
hardship relief, under which debts are restructured and Names are allowed to
retain a house and modest income. More than 1,000 applications have been
received since the committee was set up two years ago.
Although Lloyd's decided last week to reject the introduction of a bail-out
plan - in which the market as a whole would have assumed the losses of the
hardest hit - Mr Alan Lord, chief executive, confirmed on Thursday that
talks were under way with brokers and agencies to increase the amount
available to help improve the hardship terms.
Lloyd's officials met the Lloyd's Insurance Brokers Committee on Friday,
when the idea of Lloyd's brokers contributing Pounds 25m over a three-year
period to such a fund was mooted. Agencies - which manage the affairs of
Names and syndicates - could be asked for a similar amount.
