FT  20 OCT 93 / Observer: Franc forte
Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, proudly unveiled a new
series of banknotes yesterday, starting with a FFr50 bill. Unsurprisingly,
he had a ready reply to the query that now might seem an undiplomatic moment
to signal such a national, as opposed to European, monetary manoeuvre.
The new notes, needless to say, complement European monetary union, and
reflect 'a convergence' with Dutch and German designs. Indeed, it should all
facilitate the design of an eventual Ecu note, Trichet explained.
The new FFr50 note displays Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the aviator and
writer. It also has no less than four new anti-forgery devices, three of
which incorporate images from the aviator's writings.
'This is our latest move in the endless technological race with
counterfeiters,' Trichet boasted.
If only exchange rate policy were as simple as banknotes. Trichet was also
at pains to point out the mendacity of press suggestions that the French
government is weakening in its determination to keep the franc strong.
But that was an area of forgery over which he ruefully admitted to having no
control.
