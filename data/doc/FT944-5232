FT  05 DEC 94 / People (Names in the News): Everything rosy in Meyer Kahn's
beer garden
Watch out for Meyer Kahn, the boisterous chief executive of South African
Breweries, writes Mark Suzman. He wants to become a global player in the
international beer market, yet international investors would prefer him to
stick at what he knows best - managing a business which promises 5 per cent
plus annual volume growth for years to come.
Like many South African firms, SAB was forced to turn inward during the
apartheid era and tried to balance its stranglehold on the domestic beer
market by diversifying into areas such as retail and manufacturing.
But it is its domestic brewing business which has caught the eye of
international investors keen to play the South African stock market. After
Anglo American empire, SAB is the premier blue chip and its shares are more
highly rated than those of many brewers in far more politically stable parts
of the world.
Since the lifting of sanctions, Kahn, an irrepressible optimist about his
country's future, has wasted little time in pushing abroad. Already the
sixth largest brewery in the world by volume, the group's international
subsidiary, Westgate, has acquired breweries in Hungary, Tanzania and, most
recently, China. At the same time, the company's strong brands, Castle and
Lion lagers, have attracted a rapidly growing international following.
Kahn sees the developing world as his core market. He feels he has a
significant comparative advantage over the likes of Anheuser-Busch and
Heineken in these areas and denies any interest in competing head on with
them in Europe.
