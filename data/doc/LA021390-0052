VALLEY ROUNDUP: AMERICAN PLASTICS TO BUY OHIO OIL, GAS RESERVES 
American Plastics and Chemicals Inc. of Canoga Park said it agreed to purchase 
about 2,500 acres of land in eastern Ohio that holds reserves of oil, gas, coal 
and limestone for $1.55 million in cash, stock and debt. 
The energy and chemical company, which was previously called Petro Oil and Gas 
Inc., said it acquired the patented rights to a low-cost, pollution-free 
technology last year for producing plastics and chemicals from limestone and 
coal. It said it intends to build a plant that will use this technology on the 
land in Ohio. 
American Plastics said it plans to produce several plastics and chemicals 
through joint ventures in the United States and abroad.
