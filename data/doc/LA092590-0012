$5-MILLION BAIL FOR KEATING 
Recently, as I drove past my old Lincoln Savings branch, my mind wandered back 
to the days when I enjoyed just stopping by to view Abraham Lincoln relics on 
display in the lobby. 
Somehow, it gave me a feeling of confidence to know that my savings were in the 
hands of those who revered the principles of honest dealings so closely 
identified with Honest Abe. 
Now the place looks shabby and my vision of the care-worn face of Lincoln faded 
for a moment only to be replaced by the figures of Keating and Cranston. Of 
such experiences cynics are created and innocence is lost.
