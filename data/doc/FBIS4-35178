  [Text] In the Haitian Parliament, the tasks of the eighth 
and final session of the 45th Legislature have still not begun 
despite various attempts by the office of the Chamber of 
Deputies. Several possibilities could explain legislators' 
obvious refusal to meet at this time. It could be the presence 
of the Jonassaint government, not recognized by the assembly of 
deputies. Furthermore, the office presided over by Frantz Robert 
Monde has been subject to increasingly virulent criticism from 
several lawmakers, and various political blocs in the lower 
chamber are now facing serious internal crises. Among them is 
the Parliamentary Bloc-National Front for Change and Democracy 
[BP-FNCD] which just lost about 10 members and regrouped as the 
Social Democratic bloc. Edner Jean met with the president of the 
new political bloc, Deputy Edmond Mirold: 
  [Begin recording] [Mirold] ... Many deputies who are 
now part of the Social Democratic bloc were indeed members of 
FNCD. Most of the deputies from CONACOM [National Congress of 
Democratic Movements] are now part of this bloc, as are many 
other deputies who are not members of CONACOM, but who share the 
same trends and value the same ideas. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Does this division, which is 
established by the formation of this new bloc, not weaken the 
camp defending the return of President Aristide? 
  [Mirold] Of course. Division always creates problems 
and minority groups. We have not changed our stand regarding the 
return of President Aristide. His return is a fundamental 
element for us. It is the basis of our struggle because we stand 
for the return to constitutional order, which cannot be 
accomplished if Aristide's five-year term is not completed.
