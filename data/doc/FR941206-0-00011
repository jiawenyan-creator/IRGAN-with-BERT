 

Of the six food manufacturers/distributors who supported the proposal with some condition for modification, only
one supported the quality control criteria in the proposed rule. The other five did not support the provisions for
quality control in the proposed rule and their statements included the following: (1) Mandatory quality control
programs will be an additional burden for the meat processor in situations where special controls are not needed;
(2) the process of separating meat from bones has been historically accepted by the Agency and the industry without
mandatory programs; (3) the process is comparable to removing meat from bones by hand, a situation that does not require
a mandatory quality control program; (4) if the definition of meat includes an evaluation of the physical condition
of the bones after the meat has been removed plus the bone content of the meat as measured by calcium content, the proposal
should be referring to a partial quality control program to ensure appropriate labeling requirements are met; (5)
the Department can and should maintain its focus on food safety questions and not quality issues, possibly through
the requirement of some type of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) program; and (6) issues of product
quality, as opposed to safety, should remain within the discretion of the processing establishment. 

Of the six food manufacturers/distributors who supported the proposal with a condition for modification, three
supported the handling requirements criteria in the proposed rule. The other three did not support the rule and their
statements included the following: (1) If the current industry practices are reviewed, the Agency will find numerous
processors that exceed the proposed 72-hour time limit for using starting materials and the meat derived from the
advanced systems; (2) today, storage of meat from advanced systems at temperatures colder than 40
&cir; F (4
&cir; C) and pre-blending meat from advanced systems with curing ingredients allows the time necessary for transporting
and processing; (3) requiring the proposed time/temperature criteria will change the nature of meat as traded today
by restricting supply locations and will alter the economic balance of the market_some processors may discontinue
use of these materials because they cannot receive adequate supplies in 72 hours; and (4) the producing plant should
be responsible for controlling the environment around meat from advanced systems to ensure that microbial spoilage
does not occur. 



Trade Association Comments 



Three of the four trade associations commenting on the proposed rule supported its provisions, provided that some
modifications are made in specific areas (i.e., the definition of meat, calcium content criteria, protein quality,
quality control, and handling requirements). The other trade association did not support the proposed rule and suggested
that parity was the issue in defining meat and that the same labeling that is required for MS(S) should apply to MDP.


All four trade associations had some concerns regarding the proposed calcium content criteria and their statements
included the following: (1) Establishing a uniform standard for calcium content for both meat and poultry (i.e.,
250 mg/100 gm of product of calcium) would create comparability; and (2) a calcium content limit is unnecessary; the
Department's nutrition labeling requirements will serve to ensure that all consumers will receive specific calcium
information. 

Three of the four trade associations had some reservations regarding the proposed protein quality requirements
and their statements included the following: (1) A protein digestibility corrected amino acid score of not less than
40 expressed as a percent or an essential amino acid content of at least 33 percent of the total amino acids present in
the meat should not be required by this or any other regulation because protein quality varies significantly throughout
the meat and food supply as a whole; (2) protein quality is a marketplace issue and need not be regulated by an Agency
which is focusing on direct food safety concerns; (3) the United States is not a protein deficient society which requires
every protein source to be of highest ``quality''; and (4) there should be no restrictions on protein and fat content
for product qualified to be labeled as ``meat'' because the protein and fat content of finished products will either
be dictated by existing regulatory finished product standards, or by manufacturing specifications, and/or will
be fully delineated in nutrition labeling on finished food product packages. 

Three of the four trade associations had some reservations regarding the proposed requirement for a mandatory quality
control program to assure compliance with the provisions of the definition of meat derived from advanced systems.
Their statements included the following: (1) This requirement would only serve to impose a special requirement upon
a newer technology and a discrete sub-category of product in an arbitrary manner when other technology does not induce
the same requirement; and (2) partial quality control programs should be a voluntary option. 

Three of the four trade associations had some reservations regarding handling requirements and their statements
included the following: (1) Proper product handling is a legitimate concern for both government and industry, but
there is no apparent basis for singling out the product to be addressed by the regulation for special scrutiny; such
detailed requirements are not in place for other meat products, e.g., ground beef; (2) issues which truly relate to
food safety concerns will be addressed more frequently in industry HACCP programs as the Agency proceeds to clarify
its HACCP strategy; and (3) because such refrigeration/freezing requirements may be more broadly applied to other
red meat products, they should be developed separately from the current proposal, be broadly based, and preferably
handled within a company's HACCP framework. 



Machinery Manufacturer Comment 



The manufacturer of machinery supported the proposed rule. The machinery manufacturer also stated that, with this
new technology, meat processors will be able to fully utilize edible portions of meat carcasses by mechanical means
without the incorporation of pulverized bone or otherwise introducing significant levels of bone that are of potential
health consequence into meat systems.
