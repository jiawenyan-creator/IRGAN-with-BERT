FT  09 DEC 92 / Observer: A tale of two heads
Fancy a flutter? If so, you might try one of the Russian commemorative coins
just unveiled in the former Soviet embassy in what was East Berlin, with a
view to netting D-Marks by the million for Moscow's hard-up treasury.
Although introduced by a Russian mint official called Vladlen Antipov, whose
first name is shorthand for Vladimir Lenin, the coins bear the old Tsarist
insignia of the double-headed eagle. 'It is our new national emblem,' he
said.
True, he went on, there was the little local difficulty of the latest
Peoples' Congress failing to approve the new national arms. But it had not
definitively rejected them either. 'We give no guarantees, but I think more
deputies are for the eagle than against.'
Whereupon up popped Russian diplomat Vladimir Polenov with an
entrepreneurial twist. If the Peoples' Congress did give the bird to the
eagle, the value of the coins could soar by a hundredfold, he thought.
Beaming, Antipov followed up by naming a likely best buy for German
collectors, who for 'historical reasons' tend to take up three-fifths of the
commemorative coins issued by the Moscow mint.
On the obverse side from the eagle, he said, the Rbs25 specimen in palladium
bore a smiling Catherine the Great, German-born and an enlightened despot to
boot. Just the thing for a Christmas present at DM650 a throw.
