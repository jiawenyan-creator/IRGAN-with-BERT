P. M. BRIEFING; 
PEUGEOT WARNS OF JAPAN THREAT 
Jacques Calvet, president of France's Peugeot S.A., warned today that at least 
one of six major European auto makers will go bankrupt unless reciprocity in 
car trade between Japan and the European Community is maintained. 
"In 10 years, the capacity of Japanese auto makers manufacturing cars in Europe 
will exceed 1.5 million units, forcing one full-range automobile maker or an 
equivalent to go bankrupt," Calvet said at a news conference at the Japan 
National Press Club. 
He said globalization of the auto industry will be hampered unless reciprocity 
and harmony are established. 
Calvet said European auto makers demand that the number of Japanese cars 
registered in Europe, including locally manufactured vehicles, be limited until 
European car exports to Japan grow to a reasonable level. 
He said the ceiling should be set at a ratio of one European car sold in Japan 
to two Japanese vehicles marketed in Europe.
