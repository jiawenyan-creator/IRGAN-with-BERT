  [Text] Nagoya, Feb. 19 KYODO -- Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura said Saturday [19 February] he is opposed to 
a cabinet reshuffle before the Diet passage of the 73.08 
trillion yen fiscal 1994 state budget. 
  But Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's chief spokesman said 
in a speech in Nagoya that the premier has the final say on the 
reshuffle, which politicians both inside and outside the 
government say is aimed primarily at dumping Takemura. 
  He said he has no desire to cling to the post of chief 
cabinet secretary. 
  Speaking of a probable realignment of the nation's political 
parties, Takemura predicted it will revolve around a vision of 
Japan's future and the characters of political parties. 
  His statement suggested that Takemura's Sakigake (Harbinger) 
party will distance itself from Shinseito and Komeito, two of 
the seven coalition government partners. 
  Specifically, Takemura expressed hope that his party will be 
part of a coalition including such reform-minded men as former 
Justice Minister Masaharu Gotoda and liberal representatives of 
the Social Democratic Party such as Hokkaido Governor Takahiro 
Yokomichi.
