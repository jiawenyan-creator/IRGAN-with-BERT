FT  03 SEP 94 / Pounds 72,000 awarded to RSI sufferer
An industrial radiographer who suffered repetitive strain injury as a result
of his work has been awarded Pounds 72,000 by the Court of Session in
Edinburgh in the second highest compensation pay-ment to a sufferer in the
UK.
Mr Victor Hunter, 48, of Bridge of Weir, Renfrewshire, sustained the injury
while helping to check castings. His job with Clyde Shaw, a steelmaker of
Motherwell, near Glasgow, which is now in liquidation, involved making
repeated adjustments to a turntable carrying heavy metal components while
they were X-rayed.
Mr Frank Maguire, of solicitors Robin Thompson and Partners who handled the
case, said yesterday's judgment made it clear Mr Hunter's injuries were
caused by the excessive, repeated force of movements he had to make in the
course of his work. The defence claim that his condition was not
work-related was rejected.
Mr Hunter said his pain started with a 'small niggle in my elbows' which
grew progressively more severe and led to his absence from work for six
months. He started his legal battle, backed by the MSF technical union,
three years ago when the company made him redundant.
The case is one of several which have recently placed RSI squarely in the
category of industrial injury after an English High Court case less than a
year ago cast doubt on the condition. In rejecting a claim at the time,
Judge John Prosser said RSI was 'meaningless and had no place in medical
books'.
Since then a number of cases have contradicted that ruling and employers
appear increasingly to be seeking to settle claims out of court.
The highest UK RSI award was Pounds 79,000 to an Inland Revenue typist in
January.
