<H5>  We Are Sinking, Not Having Traveled Even a Mile </H5>
  To: V.S. CHERNOMYRDIN, chairman of the Russian Federation 
Government 
  CC: RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA Editorial Department 
  YOUR DIRECTIVES CONCERNING THE REPAYMENT OF DEBTS FOR THE 
WORK PERFORMED IN 1993 AND DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 1994 BY 
MINISTRIES OF FINANCE AND TRANSPORT ARE IGNORED. GOVERNMENT 
INACTION CONDEMNS FURTHER CONSTRUCTION OF THE NUCLEAR URAL 
ICEBREAKER AND PYETR VELIKIY CRUISER TO DEATH. IF YOUR 
ASSURANCES AND DIRECTIVES MEAN NOTHING TO MINISTERS, THEN 
RESIGN. A STRIKE COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED AT THE PLANT. 
  [Signed] V. FIRYULIN, CHAIRMAN OF THE TRADE-UNION COMMITTEE 
OF THE BALTIYSKIY PLANT JOINT-STOCK COMPANY 
  [Signed] N. CHALOV, CHAIRMAN OF THE STRIKE COMMITTEE 
<H5>  Will We Also Turn the Ural Icebreaker and the Pyetr Velikiy </H5>
Cruiser Into Scrap Metal?! 
  The Ural icebreaker and the Pyetr Velikiy cruiser are two 
most complex orders, for the execution of which the Baltiyskiy 
Plant is paid from the budget. To be more precise, it should be 
paid, since funds for the completion of Ural's construction were 
last received by the plant in November of last year and for the 
cruiser, only on Russian Federation First Deputy Defense 
Minister A. Kokoshin's personal order. 
  As we see, the alarm by the public organizations is 
well-founded. Even earlier the plant administration appealed to 
various authorities, including the president's administration 
and personally to V. Chernomyrdin. It seems that a compromise 
solution was found with N. Tsakh, chief of the Maritime Fleet 
Department of the Ministry of Transportation: In order to 
complete the construction of the icebreaker, the enterprise 
lowers profitability from 25 to 10 percent--one can say that it 
is ready to operate at a loss. It did not want to do half a job. 
While Ural's total cost is 169 million dollars, the completion 
of its construction requires 80 million dollars. (For your 
information: It is 50 percent cheaper than the icebreaker 
purchased by us from Finland). 
  "We found ourselves in an idiotic situation," Oleg 
Shulyanovskiy, president of the Baltiyskiy Plant Joint-Stock 
Company, says. "Instead of doing our work, we are forced to walk 
ministerial corridors. On 23 May we received a telegram from O. 
Soskovets that ordered the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry 
of Transportation to pay the plant, according to the contract, 
R10 billion and to decide on the program to complete the ship's 
construction. However, we already have dozens of such telegrams. 
  "We would like to finally receive from the government a 
clear 
answer: To build or not to build? Does Russia need the Ural and 
the Pyetr Velikiy, or shall we turn them into scrap metal? It 
seems that it is not the first time that we astonish the entire 
world with mismanagement and helplessness."
