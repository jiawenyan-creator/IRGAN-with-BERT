  [Text] Pyongyang, January 12 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
people and overseas Koreans are voicing support to "10-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the 
reunification of the country" put forward by the great leader 
President Kim Il-song. 
  A dissident pack in Seoul said he believed that only when 
the 
70 million Koreans were closely united as one under the banner 
of the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole 
nation, could great national harmony and the historic cause of 
national reunification, the desire of the Korean nation, be 
achieved despite the grim situation caused by continued acute 
confrontation between the North and the South. 
  A student of Korea University surnamed Yi said: "The supreme 
task facing our nation is to reject foreign forces and reunify 
the country through a great unity of the whole nation. The 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation put forward by 
President Kim Il- song clearly indicates the way of representing 
and defending the common will and interests of the nation as 
well as the interests of every member of the nation, 
transcending the differences in ideology and ideal, religious 
belief and social system." 
  A certain Ri, a journalist of SEOUL SINMUN, said: 
"Intolerable is the attitude of the South Korean authorities who 
oppose fellow countrymen and refuse reunification because of 
their `ideology- first' cold war mode of thinking. The 10-point 
programme must be welcomed and supported as a great charter 
opening the way for great national unity and indicating the road 
to reunification." 
  The Canadian headquarters of the National Alliance for the 
Country's Reunification and the Consultative Conference for the 
Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued 
a joint statement, praising the 10-point programme. They said 
the programme closely combined democracy with the reunification 
issue, thus confirming that reunification and democracy are 
inseparable from each other and the unified country must be a 
democratic state.
