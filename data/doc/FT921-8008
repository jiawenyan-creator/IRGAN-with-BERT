FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (7): Conventions on a
grand scale
IN June this year, 35,000 Lions Club members will descend on Hong Kong,
putting the territory's three-year-old Convention and Exhibition Centre to
its first real test, writes David Dodwell.
For the first time, Hong Kong will be home to the annual Lions Club
international convention. Three years ago, the territory had neither the
hotel rooms, nor the conference halls to cope with an inundation of even a
quarter this size.
'Hong Kong was very busy, very full rand very expensive,' recalls Ms Amy
Chan, chief executive of the territory's Convention and Incentive Travel
Bureau.
Since then, 18 hotels have been opened, with a further 10 due to open this
year. Hong Kong's hotel room capacity will have more than doubled to 35,000
rooms.
Most critically, however, the 194,000 sq ft Convention and Exhibition Centre
opened in June 1988, allowing Hong Kong to compete for the first time with
Singapore as the prime conference location in Asia.
Panoramically poised on the Wanchai waterfront in the heart of downtown Hong
Kong, it is served by six luxury hotels, and claims to offer one of the
world's best-equipped and most versatile facilities.
And after the Lions, what next? Most ambitious of all, Hong Kong is bidding
hard to host the 1997 World Bank meeting  - 'and life doesn't stop with
1997,' says Amy Chan. 'We are making 40 to 50 bids every year to host
conferences, some of them on a 10-year lead time.'
