FT  06 AUG 94 / R-R may buy Mercedes engines for new models
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the Vickers engineering group subsidiary, is
discussing the purchase of V12 engines and other components from
Mercedes-Benz of Germany for use in future model programmes.
Mr Peter Ward, Rolls-Royce chairman and chief executive and Vickers managing
director, operations, refused to confirm the specific talks with the German
carmaker, but said: 'We are in a number of discussions.'
Mercedes-Benz said that Rolls-Royce had approached it a year ago for talks
about engine supply for a new generation of products and said that
discussions were continuing.
Mr Ward said that Rolls-Royce was 'looking at a number of possibilities and
partners, but we are not yet close to reaching a conclusion'.
An eventual move by Rolls-Royce to purchase engines from Mercedes-Benz would
represent a significant departure for the company, which assembles its own
6.75 litre V8 engines at its plant at Crewe, Cheshire.
The current engines used in Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars are derived from an
original 6.25 litre V8 engine launched by the company in 1958, although the
engines have since been substantially updated.
Rolls-Royce says that its latest engine range meets worldwide emissions
standards to the year 2000.
The Mercedes-Benz 6 litre V12 was launched in 1991 in its S-Class model. It
produces about 8,500 V12 engines a year. Rolls-Royce and Bentley production
was 1,263 last year.
Rolls-Royce is seeking collaboration agreements with other carmakers to help
to finance the development of future model generations.
Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers chief executive, said earlier this year that
Rolls-Royce did not have the financial resources to develop a new model
generation alone. It planned to evolve the present models but would need
some form of partnership in the second half of the 1990s.
