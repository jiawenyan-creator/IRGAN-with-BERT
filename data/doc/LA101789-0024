VALLEY EARNINGS: SALES AND PROFIT INCREASE 19% AT SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES 
Superior Industries International, a Van Nuys-based producer of automobile 
wheels, said its third-quarter profit and sales climbed 19% from a year 
earlier. 
In the quarter ended Sept. 30, Superior's net income rose to $3.02 million from 
$2.53 million a year earlier, while its sales increased to $53.5 million from 
$45.1 million. 
Superior, a leading maker of wheels for the major U.S. auto makers, noted that 
the gains came during a traditionally slow quarter, when domestic car makers 
are retooling their plants for the new model year. 
For the first nine months of 1989, Superior's earnings rose 27%, to $11.2 
million from $8.80 million a year earlier. Its nine-month sales increased 29%, 
to $185.2 million from $143.5 million.
