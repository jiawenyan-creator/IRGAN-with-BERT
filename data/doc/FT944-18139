FT  05 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Monks retreats from 70s deals
The unions want a 'social partnership' with a future Labour government, not
a return to the social-contract style deals of the 1970s when they demanded
influence in managing the economy, Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary,
said last night, Robert Taylor writes.
It is the first time a TUC general secretary has been to a Labour party
conference for more than 50 years. He told a fringe meeting he was also keen
to press the unions' policy agenda with Mr Michael Portillo, the employment
secretary. 'It may be we do not have a great deal of impact on him but if he
chooses not to consider what we have to say I believe he will have to pay a
political price for that.'
Mr Monks said: 'Despite the social advantages, 1970s style corporatism is
now as dated as kaftans and beads - and has even less chance of a comeback.
Much time and effort was spent with ministers, civil servants and employers
and their representatives. Too little time was spent in the workplaces.'
All the unions wanted now was what Mr Tony Blair had called 'fairness not
favours' partly because it would force them 'out of any temptation to rely
on cosy chats - even if lubricated with chablis and canapes in a smoke-free
zone rather than the beer, sandwiches and smoke-filled rooms of the past'.
The 'social contract' of 20 years ago had been 'too much a cosy agreement
between the unions and the government, rather than genuinely tripartite'. Mr
Monks said: 'The task now for the unions, employers and a new government is
to work out ways of regaining some of the advantages of that period without
trying to replicate structures and ideas that can no longer work.'
