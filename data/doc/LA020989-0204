DEFINE ISSUES, DEMOCRATS URGED 
Ronald H. Brown, preparing to take over as Democratic Party chairman, told 
party officials today that they face "tough adversaries" and must work to 
define party positions more forcefully on issues such as defense, crime and 
drugs. 
Brown, who on Friday will become the first black to chair a major political 
party, told the Assn. of State Democratic Chairs, "I am going to be a 
common-sense, pragmatic chairman." He told the state party leaders, "We've got 
a difficult job ahead, we've got tough adversaries. . . .They don't care much 
about truth or about decency." 
Taking over amid concern about the erosion of the party's Southern base, Brown 
said, "I don't want to be chairman of a party that writes off any region of the 
country."
