<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Simplified Port Checks Due For Ships"] </F>
  [Text] China is ready to reform its decades-old system of 
port inspections to bring procedures in line with international 
norms. 
  As proposed before the State Council, the new rules cancel 
the need for harbour officers to always conduct on-board 
inspections of ships entering and leaving Chinese ports. 
  Instead, the shipping companies or their agents can 
generally 
conduct the checks themselves and then report the results to the 
officials. 
  The checks affected by the new rules are for the harbour 
superintendency, customs, frontier checkpost and sanitary 
quarantine units. 
  The new procedures, called "clearance-upon-trust," are 
expected to take effect later this year if they get the nod from 
the State Council, said a source from the Ministry of 
Communications. 
  The ship inspections may be conducted within a specified 
period of time before or after the vessel pulls into a berth. 
The rule applies to both domestic and foreign ships. 
  The existing on-board checks have often delayed 
foreign-trade 
ships. As a result, many prefer to call at Hong Kong and ports 
of other countries. 
  According to the new rules, more flexible clearance checks 
are to be implemented for ships calling at frontier ports and 
shuttling within short routes. 
  The new system is also intended to establish more efficient 
ship inspections and to stress ship owners' awareness of Chinese 
laws.
