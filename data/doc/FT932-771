FT  26 JUN 93 / Customs aims to hit Channel smugglers
BRITISH CUSTOMS officials are planning a big crackdown on cross-Channel
bootleggers.
Officers from the investigation division of HM Customs &amp; Excise are
preparing raids in the next few weeks on up to seven teams of professional
smugglers it has identified as a result of surveillance and
intelligence-gathering.
The action follows two raids in recent weeks that led to the seizure of up
to Pounds 100,000 in goods and questioning of 18 individuals.
Officials will also lobby the authorities to revoke the alcohol licences of
any shops and pubs caught accepting goods on which no duty has been paid.
Two men charged with evading duty on 11 tons of cans and bottles of beer
were remanded until July 9 at Thames court, east London, yesterday after the
first successful prosecution of an evader last month.
Up to the end of May, 24 cases had led to arrests and charges concerning
goods worth Pounds 142,000; 243 were proceeding to prosecution or fines on
goods worth Pounds 419,000; and 175 cases involving goods totalling Pounds
18,409 had been dealt with simply through seizure.
The actions reflect a shift of Customs resources from border controls
towards greater use of intelligence to detect likely duty evaders.
Since the start of the year, anyone is entitled to import 'reasonable
quantities' of alcohol and tobacco for personal use. Customs officers
believe that relatively little systematic smuggling has taken place.
Mr Tim Hampson of the Brewers' Society called the removal of restrictions
for personal use 'a bootleggers' charter' that was affecting the trade of
brewers, pubs and off-licences around the country, particularly in the
south-east.
Customs argues that lifting the personal restrictions will reduce excise
duties by about Pounds 250m a year.
