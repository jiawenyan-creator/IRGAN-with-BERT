FT  07 AUG 92 / Abbey National acts against fraud
ABBEY NATIONAL has sent letters to 16,000 solicitors this week telling them
that they must allow the bank access to files about their clients when
necessary.
The move is part of a drive to halt rising levels of mortgage fraud, and
Abbey National said it had already received letters from about 4,000
solicitors agreeing to the conditions. To date there have been no refusals.
It is thought to be the first time a mortgage lender has told solicitors
that it wants to be able to check borrowers' details before a house sale
takes place.
Abbey National said: 'We shall not be asking for any personal information.
The inquiries will be strictly limited to information relating to the house
sale and in particular to ensuring that a potential borrower is the person
that they say they are.'
