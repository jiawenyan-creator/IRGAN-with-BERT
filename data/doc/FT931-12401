FT  28 JAN 93 / Redundancy move is ruled unlawful
A UNILATERAL change to employees' redundancy terms at a General Electric
Company plant was unlawful, the High Court ruled yesterday at a sitting in
Birmingham.
Lawyers representing unions involved believe this case alone will cost the
company Pounds 5m and have wide-ranging implications at other GEC plants and
at other companies.
The case directly affects the Beeston plant of GPT in Nottingham, which is
60 per cent owned by GEC and 40 per cent by Siemens.
As part of a cost-cutting exercise in 1991 GEC reduced the relatively
generous redundancy terms which then prevailed at many plants to near the
statutory minimum of one week's pay for each year of service.
The effect of yesterday's ruling by Mr Justice Connell is that GEC has to
reinstate the original redundancy terms at Beeston of four weeks' pay for
every year of service for the 1,800 employees.
It will also almost certainly have to make up the difference between the
original and the new terms for 800 employees made redundant after the terms
were changed. The company said last night that it had not decided whether to
appeal.
The main legal point clarified yesterday was that redundancy terms enshrined
in a collective agreement were deemed to be part of an individual contract
of employment.
