FT  11 OCT 93 / Observer: Crowding out
Observer has already raised an eyebrow at the apparent ease with which
Nigeria secured an invitation to the biennial gathering of Commonwealth
members in a year when the African state has ignored the outcome of a
presidential election and kept the soldiers in power. Now Chief Ernest
Shonekan, the former businessman who fronts for the military as head of
state, seems to be pushing his luck still further.
Commonwealth officials are appalled to learn that the chief plans to
surround himself at next week's conference in Cyprus with an entourage
numbering no less than 60. This is four or five times as many people as John
Major will be taking; such a clutch would of course also vastly outnumber
the Queen's party, an organiser points out.
So it is being gently suggested that Shonekan might make do with fewer.
After all, a country seeking backing for its efforts to reschedule Dollars
34bn in external debt should perhaps be seen to be cutting back a bit on
outings for the boys.
