FT  10 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Japanese software decision
The Japanese authorities have decided not to sanction certain types of
reverse engineering whereby software programmes are decompiled so that their
contents can be analysed and recompiled in different form, writes Michiyo
Nakamoto in Tokyo.
A report by the Agency of Cultural Affairs decided not to include a
recommendation endorsing reverse engineering. The decision follows a formal
US complaint last year over the Japanese move to recommend legalising
software decompilation and is likely to ease tension with the US over
intellectual property rights. In reverse engineering, the binary code of a
software programme is translated into readable form and then recompiled into
a new programme slightly different from the original.
The process enables companies to pirate software programmes of others but is
also useful to ensure that new software programmes are compatible with
existing systems.
