<F P=106> [Statement by "a military source"; place and date not given] </F>
  [Text] While our brave Armed Forces -- the forces of unity 
and legitimacy -- have fully complied with the declaration of 
cease-fire on all axes as of 2400 yesterday [6 June], in 
implementation of Security Council Resolution 924, the 
rebellious separatist gang, led by the [Yemeni] Socialist Party 
[YSP], violated the cease-fire resolution and continued its 
aggression against our Armed Forces. The aircraft affiliated 
with this criminal gang this morning carried out aggressive 
raids against our Armed Forces positions on all axes. 
  The source warned against this violation of the cease-fire 
by 
the rebellious separatist gang, which constitutes blatant 
defiance of the international will and reflects the adventurous 
aggressive behavior of this separatist rebellious gang.
