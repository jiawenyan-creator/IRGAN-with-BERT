FT  04 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Gatt 'will not affect farmland
set-aside'
THE RECENT breakthrough in the Gatt world trade talks should not lead to a
big increase in the proportion of European Community farmland that would be
set aside from production, Mr John Gummer, agriculture minister, indicated
yesterday, David Owen writes.
Mr Gummer told the Commons the agreed 15 per cent EC set-aside level would
not be radically changed by the oilseed products settlement recently reached
by Gatt negotiators.
That view was disputed by Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, Labour agriculture
spokesman, who said the Gatt deal would result in between 20 per cent and 40
per cent of eligible land being set aside, depending on whether optimistic
or pessimistic assumptions were made.
He accused Mr Gummer of 'persistently denying the truth' on the effect the
agreement would have on Britain's farmers and farmland.
