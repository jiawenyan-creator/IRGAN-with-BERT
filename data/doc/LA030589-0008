L.A. IN THE MIND OF AMERICA 
Brownstein's article suggests incorrectly that America has something to learn 
from Los Angeles as a city. The truth is that America has nothing new to learn 
from L.A. except how not to create a city. The best things about it -- the 
climate and natural surroundings -- have only been damaged by our additions to 
them, through smog, and, now, the pollution of Santa Monica Bay. 
I believe our civic leaders should adopt an official mascot. I propose the 
capybara, a large rodent about the size of a cocker spaniel. It barks and is 
cheerful and cute. I saw one at the L.A. Zoo, drinking from its water dish, in 
which it was also standing. It also was urinating into the same water. I 
thought of this while parked in traffic on the 405 Freeway near Santa Monica 
Boulevard staring at a soon-to-be completed office complex with 7,000 new 
parking spaces.
