P&amp;G SOFTENER WILL CUT WASTE 
In a move with major consumer products implications, Procter &amp; Gamble Co. 
introduced a concentrated refill for its Downy fabric softener Wednesday that 
uses 75% less packaging material and will generate less solid waste. 
A carton of Downy Refill mixes with twice as much water to replenish the 
reusable 64-ounce plastic Downy bottle. It is one of several new packaging 
schemes aimed at reducing garbage, an issue of growing concern as the nation's 
landfills reach capacity. 
Industry experts said they expect other manufacturers to follow suit.
