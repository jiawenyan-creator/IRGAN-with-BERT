MUSIC REVIEWS; 
PIANIST KAHANE PERFORMS AT EL CAMINO COLLEGE 
No stranger to Southland audiences, pianist Jeffrey Kahane has been giving 
recitals here for more than a dozen years. Now 33, he continues to bring 
insight and intellect to his programs, as he did Friday evening at El Camino 
College. 
Following a refined account of Debussy's "Estampes," the pianist turned to 
Bartok's "Improvisations on Hungarian Peasant Songs." Showing fine control 
throughout, he played with both intimate subtlety and explosive dynamism. 
Like Bartok's "Improvisations," Kenneth Frazelle's "Blue Ridge Airs," written 
68 years later, weaves simple folk melodies into an intricate yet 
understandable contrapuntal fabric. The composer, whose music Kahane has 
actively championed, paced his ideas skillfully, and managed to create a wealth 
of variety -- rhythmic, textural and timbral -- without rambling. 
Though obviously challenging to play, "Blue Ridge Airs" (written for Kahane) 
makes fine use of the instrument's capacities, and the pianist made a moving 
and virtually irrefutable case for it. 
Following intermission, Kahane turned to Chopin, first the Impromptu in 
F-sharp, then the B-minor Sonata. As before, Kahane conveyed a sure sense of 
direction and purpose and brought out details with uncommon clarity. His 
account of the Sonata was neither deeply personal nor technically flawless but 
nonetheless an intelligent, balanced and ultimately satisfying one. TERRY
