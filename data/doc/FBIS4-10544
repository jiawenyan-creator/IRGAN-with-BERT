  [Excerpt] (NA-DYN) -- The defeat of the Justicialist Party 
in the Federal Capital in Sunday's election claimed its first 
head yesterday [12 April] as candidate Matilde Menendez resigned 
from her newly won seat at the Constituent Assembly. 
  There was no word at press time whether the Peronist 
candidate planned to resign as well from her post as president 
of the PAMI [Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan] pensioners' 
health care service. 
  Menendez, under fire since a bribery scandal involving PAMI 
erupted in late February, said in a letter to the local branch 
of the Justicialist Party that she had never been one to cling 
"either to candidacies or to personal political ambitions." 
  She said she was stepping down to concentrate on setting 
"the 
actions under investigation." [passage omitted]
