IRAN AGAIN DANGLES OFFER ON HOSTAGES 
President Hashemi Rafsanjani today offered to help gain freedom for 18 Western 
hostages in Lebanon if Washington releases frozen Iranian assets or helps 
resolve the cases of three kidnaped Iranians. 
He appeared to refer to Iranians kidnaped by the Lebanese Forces militia in 
north Lebanon in 1982, along with their Lebanese driver, a Shiite Muslim. All 
four are believed dead. 
Speaking to a news conference attended by mostly foreign reporters, Rafsanjani 
also ruled out any participation by U.S. corporations in Iran's post-war 
reconstruction. 
"I don't think American companies can play any role in Iran," he said. 
Rafsanjani spoke in a soft voice, smiling frequently as he played with a string 
of worry beads. 
"If the conditions are right, we might be able to do something" about the 
abducted Westerners, he said. 
It was not the first time that Iran has linked its help in releasing Western 
hostages to the unfreezing of the assets or the release of the kidnaped 
Iranians. 
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, "Our position 
has not changed. We do not link the Iranian assets to the hostages, and we do 
not make deals for hostages." 
As for Iran's influence over the hostages, Fitzwater said, "We have always said 
we believe that they have an influence on the hostages, that they have 
considerable knowledge, but we can't gauge how specific that is." 
He said the United States has provided Iran with all the information it has on 
Iranians kidnaped in Lebanon.
