FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Growth in pensions side lifts Britannic
Assurance
BRITANNIC Assurance yesterday announced an interim dividend increased from
9.2p to 10.3p and significant growth in premium income for the first six
months of this year.
In line with the rest of the industry, pensions registered the strongest
results, boosted by rising unemployment as people made redundant transferred
their pension funds.
The ordinary branch's with-profits pension business saw a 60 per cent
increase to Pounds 57.8m (Pounds 36m).
New business in unit-linked pensions more than doubled, to Pounds 6.81m
(Pounds 3.29m).
Ordinary branch life assurance premiums were up almost 20 per cent to Pounds
41.8m (Pounds 34.9m), helped by the company's single-premium with-profits
bond.
Elsewhere in the group, industrial branch assurance new business rose from
Pounds 58m to Pounds 60.7m.
General branch premium income improved from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 15.1m and
the underwriting loss was cut from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 2.3m.
Britannic also announced reductions of between 1 per cent and 2 per cent in
the terminal bonuses payable on 10-year and 15-year with-profits products.
Mr Brian Shaw, general manager and actuary, attributed this to the sluggish
markets this year, which had forced the company to make slight reductions
compared to the high returns available in the mid-1980s.
He pointed out that Britannic was able to phase reductions in gradually by
announcing terminal bonuses every six months, rather than annually as used
to be the case.
