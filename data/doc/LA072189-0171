P.M. BRIEFING; 
BUSH'S CLEAN-AIR BILL UNDER FIRE 
President Bush's clean-air bill, which was formally presented to Congress 
today, drew criticism from a key senator and environmentalists because it would 
ease an early draft's requirements for reducing motor vehicle pollution and 
provide wide government latitude to meet industry concerns. 
Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chief Senate sponsor of clean-air legislation, said 
the final language of Bush's bill "will significantly tarnish his image to be 
the environmental President." Baucus said the bill would increase motor vehicle 
emissions, allow cities too much time to clean air and give too much weight to 
cost in toxic chemical cleanup. 
The latest version of the proposal would push back new vehicle emissions 
standards and would give the EPA administrator discretion to delay new 
regulations even further.
