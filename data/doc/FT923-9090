FT  07 AUG 92 / Letter: Commercial principle is ignored
Sir, David Porter's letter ('Subsidies have been forgotten by energy users',
August 5) obviously reflects the interest of his Association of Independent
Electricity Producers' members in high electricity prices if they seek to
increase (or persuade others to increase) overcapacity in generation at
current fuel prices.
What happened to large industrial customers' prices for 1987 to March 1991
was that an attempt was made to give them the benefit of ordinary commercial
discount for quantity and regularity of custom, and also to recognise the
value of load shedding at times of system stress.
The present (and former) general system of pricing does not otherwise
accommodate this commercial principle. The problem with the present system
is that, in principle, big users pay the same prices for energy as domestic
consumers, which is absurd. The difference in final delivered price of
electricity arises from the additional costs of distribution to domestic
consumers, as David Porter well knows.
If he has evidence of state subsidy to Britain's European competitors'
electricity suppliers, he should let the European Commission have it. Our
studies simply show that the continental supply industry behaves more
commercially than ours.
