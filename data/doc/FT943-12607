FT  23 JUL 94 / Property: For those who fancy a village of their own - Not
all country estates contain such a bonus. But there are plenty of other
reasons for spending big on rural living
It is rare that a complete estate - including the village - comes up for
sale. The last one was Glympton Park in the Cotswolds, sold to controversial
Australian tycoon Alan Bond in 1988 for a reputed Pounds 11m-Pounds 13m. (It
was sold on 18 months later.) Now, another Cotswold estate is for sale with
1,748 acres and an entire, unspoilt village of 25 houses and cottages.
Between Pounds 8m-Pounds 10m will buy Salperton Park, a late-Georgian
mansion set amid parkland in one of the most beautiful parts of England.
Village apart, the deal includes a farm, 199 acres of woods, and a partridge
and pheasant shoot. The vendor is Victor Watkins, a building entrepreneur,
who bought it in 1981 and has improved house and land greatly. The agent is
Savills.
True estates are large parcels of land, usually over 500 acres (unlike the
houses with a few acres that agents label 'estates' to make them sound more
than they are). Buyers are attracted for various reasons: among them the
house, the shooting or the farming.
Most buyers have not owned an estate before, and where to pitch a bid is an
art. Buying agent William Gething, of Property Vision, first works out the
price of its parts - which may be the same as the lots into which large
properties are often divided - and assesses how many others could be
interested. Then he looks at the drawbacks. Is the house too near a road?
Does the land have gaps where bits were sold off in the past?
Then comes the tricky question: is the whole worth more than the sum of the
parts? For Salperton, which is so clearly a unit, the answer is yes. The
same would apply to another Cotswold estate, Haycroft, near Northleach, for
which Savills is seeking offers over Pounds 2.75m.
This has fewer acres (636) than Salperton but house and land are in a
valley, which helps to integrate the other buildings - a mill house, three
cottages, barns and a stable-yard. Then, too, there is pheasant and duck
shooting.
For Savills, 1994 is proving a bumper year for marketing estates. Also on
the firm's books (for Pounds 3.5m) is Chilham Castle and its 298 acres in
Kent. There is a 17th century brick mansion (with additions) and a garden
said to have been shaped by the noted designer John Tradescant.
Chilham is near the Channel tunnel station at Ashford and there have been
inquiries from abroad. Possible uses are as a hotel or some other type of
leisure development - the castle has been open to the public - or a company
headquarters.
Other residential estates for sale include Westhall (430 acres) in
Aberdeenshire, a tower house with Victorian extension plus a sauna, heated
swimming pool and tennis court, all indoors to defeat the Scottish weather
(from Smiths Gore: offers over Pounds 1m); and Zeals (375 acres) in
Wiltshire, listed Grade I (Egerton, Pounds 2.25m).
Owners usually prefer to sell an estate as a whole in order to maintain what
they have cherished, but this does not always work out. At Tythrop near
Oxford (Savills), the farmland is mostly under offer but the magnificent big
house awaits a buyer. At Stratton Audley near Bicester (Strutt &amp; Parker),
and Brede Place in East Sussex (KFR), the house has gone and the land waits.
Christopher Wilson, of buying agent Wilson &amp; Wilson, stresses that farming
is a profitable business again. Although uncertainties lie ahead - such as
how the European Union will review the money-gulping Common Agricultural
Policy - he says that 'net pre-tax yields of 9 to 10 per cent are feasible
if there are enough economies of scale'. This usually means buying more land
while using the same number of men and machines. His firm will prepare a
business plan, including a three-year cash-flow analysis, for a new owner.
Financial institutions selling farming estates, such as Ariel Farms (part of
the BBC pension trust), will do very well as land prices have risen steeply
over the past 18 months.
In Cambridgeshire, Ariel (through KFR) is offering Woodwalton (1,693 acres)
at Pounds 2.95m (to include two farmhouses, three cottages, farm buildings
and a shoot). In Essex, Ariel has Little Braxted Hall (737 acres), with a
superb partridge shoot - the vendors advise retaining the gamekeeper - and
an irrigation licence for 30m gallons to ensure the best potatoes (also KFR,
offers over Pounds 1.75m).
The best sporting estate on the market is Gunnerside (26,485 acres, mostly
heather) in West Yorkshire, with a rich variety of beats and some of the
most exciting grouse shooting in Britain. Savills seeks substantial offers.
The same agent is asking Pounds 1.35m for Scargill (4,222 acres) with a
smaller grouse moor in Teesdale, Co. Durham, where Murray is joint agent.
Where, though, do the pounds go furthest? Probably Ireland. The splendid
Woodbrook House in Co. Wexford, with a 39ft-long drawing room, a
cantilevered spiral staircase and a park, is on sale for the first time
since the house was built in 1780. Hamilton Osborne King will auction it in
Dublin on August 9, suggesting IPounds 500,000 for house and 238 acres.
