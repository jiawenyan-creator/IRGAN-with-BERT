EARNINGS 
Alcoa: The world's largest maker of aluminum products earned a record $944.9 
million for all 1989, a 9.6% rise over 1988's record profit. 
Sales totaled a record $10.91 billion, up 11%. For the fourth quarter, earnings 
fell 25% to $164.7 million; sales rose 2% to $2.69 billion. The 
Pittsburgh-based company cited strength in its Australian and Brazilian units, 
accounting for 42% of 1989 profit, during most of the year. However, the fourth 
period was marked by a decline in shipments and revenue, lower prices for ingot 
and most fabricated products, a shift in product mix and higher raw material 
costs.
