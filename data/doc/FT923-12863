FT  16 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Representation remains an expensive
business - The row over benefits to Members
THE 38 per cent increase in office cost allowances that MPs awarded
themselves in the small hours of yesterday morning means Mrs Edwina Currie's
battered black electric typewriter can finally be consigned to the
scrapheap.
The former health minister celebrated yesterday's vote by ordering Pounds
4,000 worth of new computer equipment. As a further consequence of the
Pounds 10,974 per annum increment, Mrs Currie will be able to give her staff
a substantial pay rise, which means she can 'stop avoiding their reproachful
eyes'.
The 'very relieved' Derbyshire South MP, who took part in the Tory backbench
rebellion which overturned government efforts to limit the rise to some
Pounds 4,000 or 9.8 per cent, is in no doubt that the eye-catching increase
is justified.
Factors such as the televising of parliament and the impact of the recession
on constituents have meant that the average MP's workload has risen
substantially, she says, pointing out that she dealt last year with 1,100
cases of constituents asking for help of one kind or another.
These demands on available resources meant that she overshot the then Pounds
28,986 office costs allowance by just under Pounds 4,000, meeting the excess
from her own pocket.
The overshoot was only kept this low by dint of draconian measures in the
second half of the year. 'From September onwards, my staff had to get
permission to buy pens,' she says. 'My secretary in Derbyshire had to wait
until April 1 to get a chair.'
Emphasising that she paid some Pounds 2,000 in tax on the Pounds 7,000 she
claimed last year in car mileage allowance, Mrs Currie also argues that
critics sometimes over-estimate the generosity of MPs' other expense
entitlements (see table).
'I am saving hard to replace a three-year-old car,' she says, pointing out
that MPs do not benefit from car-loan schemes or pool cars and that the
travel allowance for spouses and children is 'also taxable'.
Such tales of relative hardship and deprivation cannot disguise that expense
allowances are a subject about which MPs are inordinately sensitive,
however.
Their sternest critics see their entitlements as little short of a racket
whereby backbenchers can boost their basic salary of Pounds 30,854 to a
combined pay and benefits package of Pounds 100,000 or more.
Many MPs - particularly on the government side - enjoy paid private-sector
directorships or consultancies which supplement their earnings further at
the cost of time which they could be devoting to their constituency
responsibilities.
Labour, meanwhile, bears the brunt of allegations that by basing secretaries
in constituencies, they can use individuals who are paid from public funds
to anchor local party organisations by conducting mass mailings and the
like.
At the very least, critics say, MPs should set an example to others by
exercising restraint during a difficult period for the domestic economy. The
government's current austerity drive, after all, succeeded last week in
limiting the pay increases awarded to senior civil servants.
There is certainly little doubt that MPs of the old school would see their
latter day counterparts as spoiled. Before implementation of the independent
Lawrence committee report into the pay of members of both houses of
parliament in 1964, there were only 'a limited number of allowances
available to MPs', as the relevant Public Information Office fact-sheet
recounts.
The report of the independent review body whose recommendation MPs endorsed
last night does much to back up their case, however - particularly regarding
the extent to which their workloads have increased.
According to the report, the amount of correspondence received by MPs now
averages 300 letters per week, against the 200 which a survey commissioned
in 1986 indicated they were being sent. 'The overwhelming weight of the
evidence we have received . . is that the present resources, however
apportioned, are no longer adequate,' the report states.
In spite of this, the report shows, as many as 38 per cent of MPs in 1990-91
still employed less than the full-time equivalent of 1.5 staff for which the
office costs allowance notionally provided.
The report also indicates that UK legislators are comparatively unpampered
by international standards. The staff allowance for each member of the US
House of Representatives, for example, is put at Dollars 515,760 or more
than Pounds 289,000 at the rate of exchange prevailing on April 15, 1991.
