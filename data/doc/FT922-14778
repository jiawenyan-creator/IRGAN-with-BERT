FT  04 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family Housing market still gloomy - At a
glance
The latest house price index from the Nationwide building society gives
little cheer for the depressed property market. It showed a marginal fall of
0.2 per cent in house prices during March, and a fall of 4.9 per cent since
March 1991.
Nationwide does, however, see some signs of hope. It reports that house
prices have flattened after recent monthly falls. It also says that there
were strong signs of increased activity in the market until the general
election was announced. People now have their homebuying plans on hold until
after April 9.
