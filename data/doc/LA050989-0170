IN BRIEF; 
PETE ROSE REPORT SENT TO GIAMATTI 
Baseball moved another step closer today to deciding the fate of Cincinnati 
Reds manager Pete Rose. 
John M. Dowd, the lawyer leading Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti's 
investigation of Rose, has submitted his report to the commissioner's office. 
A statement from the commissioner today said: "John Dowd . . . has submitted 
his report to me regarding allegations concerning Mr. Pete Rose. Should any 
additional information relevant to the investigation be obtained, he will 
forward it to me. I will now study the report thoroughly." 
The investigation reportedly has concentrated on Rose's gambling activities, 
especially on determining if the manager bet on baseball games. 
"It's a substantial report that the commissioner can read and study," Dowd said 
Monday in a telephone interview from his Washington office.
