  [Text] We have received a statement by Ukraine's Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs. It says, in particular: 
  "Ukraine regards the signing of a new Israeli-Palestinian 
accord on 4 May this year in Cairo as an important step toward a 
Middle East peace settlement, opening new prospects for defusing 
the Arab-Israeli conflict. The agreement signed provides an 
exceptional chance to extinguish the fire of the planet's 
longest conflict and start a new era of relations in the region. 
  "Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs once again declares 
its unchanging readiness to assist, on a bilateral as well as a 
multilateral basis, further removal of confrontation and the 
search for equal and mutually beneficial coexistence between 
Israel and the Arab region."
