FT  24 APR 91 / World Trade News: France's export credit claims rise
FRENCH exporters made FFr11.4bn (Pounds 1.13bn) of net claims on
state-guaranteed contracts last year, equivalent to around 1 per cent of
France's total overseas sales, said Coface, the French export credit
guarantee agency.
The figure, the balance between overall repayments on state-guaranteed
exports handled by Coface and premium and other income, is a slight increase
on the FFr10.9bn of claims on state-covered exports paid out the previous
year.
It does not include claims expected from unpaid bills related to the Gulf
war, likely to be around of FFr5bn this year, forecast Coface officials.
However, Iraq was already among last year's worst payers, as were Egypt,
Morocco, Nigeria and Brazil, said officials.
Coface saw a 23 per cent rise in reimbursements it had to pay out on its own
account, rather than on the export credit guarantees it manages on behalf of
the Government. These rose from FFr290m to FFr345m, with the worst
performance coming from the recession-hit UK, plus Spain and Italy, said Mr
Henri Baquiast, chairman of Coface.
The group covers short term credits of less than three years and political
risks in the European Community, while it acts as an agency for the state
for most non-EC political risks and medium term credit guarantees.
Coface saw its operating profits fall from FFr133.8m in 1989 to FFr103.5m
last year, but exceptional gains lifted net earnings by FFr22.9m to
FFr158.4m.
Premium income on Coface's own activities rose by 9 per cent to FFr605m, but
Mr Baquiast did not expect the growth rate to improve significantly this
year, given the uncertain outlook for French industry's main export markets.
Coface was last year transformed from a government department into a
state-owned company, partly in anticipation of the European Commission's
increasingly tough policy on state support for exports.
