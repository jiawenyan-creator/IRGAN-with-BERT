FT  18 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead
Reuters Holdings, the financial information and news company, is expected to
report an increase in pre-tax profits of about 10 per cent to Pounds 187m
for the six months to June 30.
Most interest will focus on the group's two newest financial products. The
second phase of Dealing 2000, the group's automated foreign exchange trading
system, started in April, while last month saw the launch of Globex, its
screen trading system for futures and options.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals group, reports its
second quarter results on Tuesday. After weeks of focusing on Wellcome and
its share offer, analysts have been dusting off their SB files. Their
estimates for pre-tax profits range from about Pounds 246m to Pounds 258m.
That compares with Pounds 230m for the same period last year.
They will be looking particularly at the rate of growth of Relafen, SB's
arthritis drug, and how Kytril, its anti-nausea medicine is competing with
Glaxo's Zofran. Few signs of growth in the consumer businesses are expected.
John Menzies, the Edinburgh-based retailer and newspaper wholesaler, is
expected to report pre-tax profits of about Pounds 23m for the year-ended
April, little changed from the previous year's Pounds 21.5m after Pounds 4m
of exceptional charges.
Wholesaling has held up well but retailing has failed to show concrete
improvement. Problems persist with its Early Learning Centre business in the
US. Further provisions are expected and its sale is likely.
Greycoat, the property developer, is likely to turn in on Thursday a
full-year loss of about Pounds 7m, a big improvement on the previous year's
Pounds 38.5m after Pounds 64m of provisions.
First Technology, the maker of sensors and crash dummies, appears to have
survived a nasty financial mishap. From a loss of Pounds 3m in the previous
year, it is likely to have done better than breakeven for the latest year
when it reports on Thursday.
