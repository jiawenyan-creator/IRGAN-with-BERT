FT  25 APR 92 / UK Company News: Dowty chief spurns TI bid
MR BRUCE RALPH, chief executive of Dowty, the aerospace components company
facing a hostile Pounds 482m bid from TI Group, yesterday said that the real
battle would be over price.
As the company marshalled its resources to repel the 4-for-15 share bid, Mr
Ralph accused TI of opportunism. It had caught Dowty while vulnerable after
an expensive redundancy programme - 3,500 job losses - and after
restructuring to take account of defence spending cuts.
He rejected TI's claim that the companies would make a good business fit.
'We can see no business fit and no commercial logic from pulling the two
together,' Mr Ralph said.
TI's aerospace division supplied ring seals for gas turbine engines while
Dowty was already a world leader in aircraft landing gear. 'They have
different customers, different manufacturing techniques, different
technologies.'
He also dismissed TI's claim that its seals and Dowty's polymer businesses
would fit. TI was involved in mechanical engineering problems while Dowty
concentrated on materials technology. 'The only commonality is that they
both have seals in their names.'
Mr Andrew Large, a non-executive director, resigned yesterday. He is due to
become chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, a position Dowty
says he cannot hold while part of a company involved in a bid.
