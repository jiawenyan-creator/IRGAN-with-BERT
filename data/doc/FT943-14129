FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (18): Upset by fears
of inflation - The professionals / After a disappointing quarter, the four
differ in their views of what will happen next
The second quarter of 1994 proved difficult for most investors, including
the four fund managers who prepare our suggested portfolios.
Most were more positive at the end of the first quarter but have been
disappointed by continued inflationary fears which have held back bond and
equity markets.
The most cautious in April was Douglas McDougall, of Baillie Gifford, who
warned that US interest rate rises had 'worrying implications for most
markets.' He raised his cash position to 15 per cent three months ago, and
is staying liquid now.
Howard Beaufort, of Newton Investment Management, admits: 'We had the
foresight to predict the necessity, the inevitability and even the timing of
the correction, but we underestimated its severity in respect of the retreat
in European bond and equity markets - most particularly in the UK.' He is
now more optimistic and argues that 'the much higher risk premiums now
priced into bonds and many equities are not justified.'
Tim Howe, of Singer &amp; Friedlander, says: 'In spite of the volatility we have
seen in equities during the last quarter, we continue to believe that the
economic fundamentals favour shares over bonds.'
The most bullish of the four is Paul Myners, of Gartmore, who says that 'not
only should investors hold stocks and bonds but, after recent setbacks, they
should seek to be fully invested.'
Howard Beaufort: 'The first half of the year has been a far from happy
experience for most investors. However, the second quarter has seen a
noteworthy stability in Far East markets including Japan, and our portfolio
has benefited both from this and from other strategic changes including a
reduction in the European equity content from 15 to 10 per cent.
'We are still very inclined to the view that what we have witnessed so far
this year is a significant correction rather than the beginnings of a major
bear market. Securities markets overshot on the upside last year because of
speculative leveraging and are now overshooting on the downside because of
deleveraging and its impact upon investor confidence.'
'Highest quality bonds now offer excellent medium-term value, and many
equities have the potential to enjoy higher multiples if they can deliver a
reliable growing earnings and dividends stream. But specific stock risk is
high in an environment of structural change, intense competition and weak
pricing power.'
Douglas McDougall: 'Three months ago, we commented that a tightening of
liquidity in the US was raising problems for all markets, and that equity
valuations around the world were high by traditional standards and
discounting a substantial economic recovery. We raised our cash target from
10 to 15 per cent, reducing each of the principal equity sectors tightly.
'This has proved a good decision, but the benefit was diluted by holding the
cash in US dollars, which we thought would benefit from interest rate
movements.
'Bond yields are now very high in relation to imminent inflation. The bear
market in bonds has been self-feeding as speculative holders have been
forced to sell. Bonds on the whole look cheap but may face further
difficulties while this liquidity squeeze persists. Equities are not cheap,
despite their falls, and may find it hard to make progress while bond yields
are so high.'
'Despite the weakness of most equity markets, we are not yet prepared to
reduce our cash position from 15 per cent. We do however feel that the case
for the dollar has weakened and will now hold half the cash in sterling.
Within the equity portfolio, we are moving 2 per cent from south east Asia
to the UK.'
Tim Howe: 'Economic recovery in Europe appears to be both stronger and
earlier than we had forecast and as a consequence, although interest rates
remain on a downward trend, the extent of their reduction is likely to be
less than we had previously thought. Elsewhere, with the exception of Japan,
the prospect of rising interest rates is real, As a result, we continue to
see little prospect of capital gain from fixed interest markets.
'In the UK, we feel that large internationally oriented stocks are likely to
outperform their smaller, more domestically biased brethren.
'At the end of the first quarter, we reduced our continental European
weighting and we are quite happy to hold our exposure there at a relatively
low level.
'We are happy with our US position but our holdings are biased in favour of
domestic stocks. In spite of political turmoil in Japan, we believe that
this market offers the most attractive prospects over the coming months and
we are increasing our weighting further.'
Paul Myners: 'Seldom have the fortunes of the world's major stock and bond
markets been so closely interlinked. Stocks are currently moved almost
entirely by bonds and bonds are broadly subject to the same force.
'The real question facing any private investor is: 'Do I own any long-term
assets at all in these circumstances?' The question of bonds or equities,
Asia or Europe, is this time far less important. All markets will rise or
fall by the same dynamic.
'We believe that the first leg down in markets was a reaction to a change in
fundamentals and was justified. Hence our decision to hold cash at the last
year end. Subsequent declines are an over-reaction, however, and present a
buying opportunity.
'The move in bonds overstates the inflationary threat. The relief for
equities is likely to come from lower bond yields; that is, bonds are likely
to lead equities. Furthermore, in most markets the relationship between
bonds and equities looks strained in favour of bonds.
'If we are wrong, bonds may not rise, but they are unlikely to fall much
further. In a static market, bond yields are sufficiently high to compensate
investors. In the case of equities, however, current bond yields could take
a further toll on valuation.
'Overall we do not believe any changes to our portfolio are merited this
quarter, although nimble investors should do better in bonds than equities.'
This feature is an allocation exercise, to see how four managers handle a
Pounds 250,000 portfolio on behalf of a hypothetical client of their choice.
They emphasise that they are investing for the long term (10 years or more)
rather than short-term gain. The exercise started at the beginning of
October 1990, and the portfolios given here were drawn up at the beginning
of this month.
