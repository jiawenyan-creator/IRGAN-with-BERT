FT  28 MAY 93 / People: From a rock to a hard place
There could hardly be two more contrasting tasks than selling products from
the rock-solid Prudential and marketing products for Invesco MIM, with its
racy past and battered reputation. But Alan Wren, who joins Invesco on
Tuesday as managing director of the UK retail division, reckons he is equal
to the challenge.
Acknowledging the UK end of the business is 'at its nadir', Wren, 43, is
attracted by the 'breadth of responsibility'. He will take charge of UK
retail activities, adding investment trusts and private clients to unit
trusts and PEPs.
Old MIM hands, complain at the clash between the old institution and the
ways of the highly successful US side, run by chairman Charles Brady. But
Wren sees the 'massive' business in the US, and the growing Far Eastern
presence, as plus factors.
The past will take time to live down - 'two years, maybe even longer', he
agrees. His priority is 'to introduce a customer, not a product, focus.'
While Invesco may seem many miles from the Pru, Wren says the problem of a
proliferation of products - 34 different units trusts valued at only Pounds
1.1bn, for instance - is one with which he is familiar.
Wren left the Pru, where he was managing director of the investment products
division, last November. After a successful first three years to 1987, sales
tailed off, investment performance went off the boil, and his plans for
European expansion were rejected.
Ronald Artus, Sir Victor Garland, and Sir Colin Southgate, all non-executive
directors, retired from the board of Prudential Corporation.
