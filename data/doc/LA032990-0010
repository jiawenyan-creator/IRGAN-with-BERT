VAN DE KAMP AND RU 486 TESTING 
Political controversy about abortion is at the center of the problem preventing 
approval in the United States of the French pill RU 486 as reported in the 
story, "Van de Kamp Requests Tests of Abortion Pill" (Part A, March 15). 
RU 486, also known as mifepristone, is one of a class of drugs known as 
anti-progesterones which may well prove to have many other beneficial uses than 
just abortion. 
It is quite possible that anti-progesterones may be useful as contraceptives, 
as inducers of labor in pregnancies that need to be delivered and which might 
otherwise require a Cesarean delivery, as therapy for endometriosis which may 
cause infertility, as therapy for hormone-dependent cancers and possibly to 
treat certain brain tumors. 
If even one of these potentially beneficial uses of anti-progesterones is 
actualized, and some of these potential uses would be to treat infertility and 
pregnancy as well as cancer, will RU 486 continue to be denied official 
approval for use in the U.S.? Is medical care to be provided at the ballot box?
