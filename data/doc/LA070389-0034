3 ARRESTED IN MELEE AT WEDDING RECEPTION 
Three Moorpark men were arrested during a melee that erupted at a wedding 
reception in the Moorpark Community Center, authorities said Sunday. 
Jesus Meza, 32, was arrested about 10 p.m. Saturday on suspicion of refusing to 
disperse and assaulting a police officer after he scuffled with Ventura County 
sheriff's deputies who had ordered about 100 wedding guests to leave, said Sgt. 
Mike De Los Santos. 
Enriquez Amezcua, 23, and Hugo Tamayo, 19, also were arrested on suspicion of 
refusing to disperse. 
De Los Santos said he did not know what originally provoked the fight. 
Twenty-five officers were called to help disperse the crowd, and several 
deputies suffered minor injuries.
