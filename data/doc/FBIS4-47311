  [Abstract] Random vibrations in technical systems may 
provide information on an object or its internal 
characteristics. Estimates of the dimensions of attractors and 
fractal properties of chaotic time series of observations may be 
used to identify motion in dynamic systems, and may diagnose 
changes in their states. Separation of true chaos from system 
noise is discussed. Examples from the field of oil and gas 
extraction are presented which illustrate the possibility of 
using these charateristics to monitor and control technological 
proesses using data obtained in the course of normal operations. 
It is shown that this information may be used to increase 
operational efficiency and extend the lifetime of equipment.
