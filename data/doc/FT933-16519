FT  03 JUL 93 / Schlesinger warns on monetary union
THE president of the Bundesbank yesterday warned against too hasty a move
towards European monetary union.
Giving evidence before the German constitutional court in Karlsruhe, which
this week held two days of hearings on the ratification of the Maastricht
Treaty, Mr Helmut Schlesinger said that moves towards monetary union should
be backed up with a 'clear structure for political union'.
Mr Schlesinger also cautioned that countries should not be granted too much
freedom of manoeuvre when it came to the 'convergence criteria' which set
the standards - including those for inflation and government borrowing -
with which countries will have to comply before being allowed to join Emu.
'It is better to have a step-by-step development (towards Emu) than a
cobbling together,' Mr Schlesinger said.
Although his comments repeat the Bundesbank's orthodox position vis-a-vis
the Maastricht treaty, these sceptical remarks before the court will add
weight to outright opponents of monetary and political union in Ger- many.
The court is unlikely to make a decision on whether Maastricht complies with
the German constitution before October this year.
If it rejects the treaty it is likely to mean the end of the process towards
monetary and political union in Europe.
