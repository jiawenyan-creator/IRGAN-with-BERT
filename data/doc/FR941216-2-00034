SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On July 1, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are 
Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (59 FR 33958) of 
proposed addition to the Procurement List. 


Comments were received during the development phase of this 
addition to the Procurement List from the current contractor, who 
alleged that the Committee had failed to follow its own regulations 
by not giving him actual notice of the proposed addition. The 
contractor also alleged that loss of this Brunswick Naval Air 
Station contract, together with two others lost to the Committee's 
program in 1993 and the probable loss of another in 1994 would have 
a significant impact on the contractor's business. The contractor 
also alleged that the Committee and NISH are prejudicial towards it 
in their choices of services being added to the Procurement List. 

The Committee is required by its law, at 41 U.S.C. 47(a)(2), to use 
the informal rulemaking procedure set forth in 5 U.S.C. 553 when 
adding commodities or services to the Procurement List. This 
rulemaking procedure mandates notice in the 

Federal Register

 rather 
than actual notice to affected parties. In this case, the 
contractor later received actual notice, as the Committee wrote to 
him requesting sales data for the company and responding to the 
other allegations in his comments. The Committee's letter, and a 
subsequent telephone conversation between the contractor and the 
Committee's Executive Director, emphasized that the Committee would 
consider the impact of the addition on the contractor to be minimal 
if the data was not submitted. Nevertheless, the contractor failed 
to submit the data and conceded in the telephone conversation that 
the impact of losing the Brunswick contract alone would not be 
severe. 

In reaching its conclusion that adding the Brunswick food service 
to the Procurement List would not have a severe adverse impact on 
the contractor, the Committee took into account the impact of the 
two 1993 additions to the Procurement List, as well as a 1989 addi 
tion where the firm was the current contractor. The Committee also 
declined to process an addition action for the other contract (a 
food service in Mississippi) mentioned by the contractor as a 
possible additional loss to the Committee's program. This decision 
reflected the Committee's concern that placing the Mississippi food 
service contract on the Procurement List at this time might cause 
severe adverse impact on the contractor. As the decision 
indicates, the Committee has taken pains to assure that its actions 
do not have a disproportional impact on this contractor, so the 
Committee denies any prejudice towards the contractor. 

After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the service, 
fair market price, and impact of the addition on the current or 
most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the 
service listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal 
Government under 41 U.S.C. 4648c and 41 CFR 512.4. 

I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the service 
to the Government. 
2. The action will not have a severe economic impact on current 
contractors for the service. 
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the service to the Government. 
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 4648c) in connection with the service proposed for 
addition to the Procurement List. 
Accordingly, the following service is hereby added to the 
Procurement List: 



Food Service Attendant, 
Naval Air Station Galley, 
Building 201, 
New Brunswick, Maine

 


This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the 
effective date of this addition or options exercised under those 
contracts.
