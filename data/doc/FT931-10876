FT  05 FEB 93 / Letter: Long-term rates for mortgages
Sir, Building societies are currently facing funding problems as depositors
find returns unattractive in a lower interest-rate environment. Some
commentators are now suggesting that the resultant diminution in lending
power may hinder the recovery. But why should building societies still be
obliged to borrow short in order to lend long?
Why should home-owners take out 25-year mortgages and then dance to the tune
of highly volatile short-term interest rates instead of the more predictable
long end of the yield curve? The latter interest payment structure is normal
practice in the US.
A change would be logical and would have the effect of smoothing the
inflation statistics as well as assisting household budget planning.
