FT  01 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: View of the EU does not represent the
majority
Sir, Lord Chalfont and others are quite wrong to put forward their view of
the European Union as that of the 'silent industrial majority' (Letters, May
31). The millions of owners and employees of small businesses would be
unlikely to agree with its main contentions.
The European single market may suit multinationals but it remains a threat
rather than an opportunity for most small UK firms (only the largest
companies, for example, can afford to commit resources to ensuring that new
European standards are not to their disadvantage).
The European social chapter is irrelevant to small companies, which are
specifically exempted by Article 2 ('Directives shall avoid imposing
administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold
back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings').
They are more worried by issues such as late payment by larger firms.
The potential entry into the European Union of low-cost central and eastern
European countries, while welcome to importers and to multinationals seeking
ever cheaper labour, fills most small firms with dread.
By all means give space to Lord Chalfont and his friends. But please
acknowledge which part of British industry they are coming from.
