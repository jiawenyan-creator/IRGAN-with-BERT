FT  26 FEB 92 / Letter: Information technology delivers only with proper
direction
Sir, It is the common misconception - that information technology should
always be a corporate function in its own right - that is responsible for
most of the marital difficulties of business and IT ('Catalogue grows of IT
woes', February 20). Despite its importance, and increasing relevance to
many companies' activities, IT should generally be subordinate to a business
systems function. Such a department - possessing a sound knowledge of the
business, information systems and the capabilities of IT - is best placed to
formulate IT policies and strategies and to direct IT. In this way a
purpose-built bridge can link the business's needs and the use of IT,
instead of the flimsy constructions which IT managers are often forced to
build.
The UK and many other countries have a wealth of good IT specialists.
Without proper direction - and a forum in which their valuable advice and
ideas can be understood and evaluated - in-house computer systems staff will
seldom be able consistently to deliver the goods.
