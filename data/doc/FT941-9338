FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: NZ bank almost doubles pay-out
National Bank of New Zealand is nearly doubling its dividend to its parent,
Lloyds Bank of the UK, to NZDollars 60m (USDollars 34m) after announcing a
48 per cent rise in after-tax profit to NZDollars 151m in the year to
December 31. In 1992 it paid Lloyds a NZDollars 34m dividend.
The bank, New Zealand's third biggest, said the improvement reflected a
strong performance across all areas of operations. Sir Spencer Russell,
chairman, said the low level of provisions for bad debt also contributed to
the profit rise. Provisions fell from NZDollars 36m to NZDollars 7m.
Profit before tax was NZDollars 215m against NZDollars 153m. The result
included a full year's contribution from Rural Bank, which was bought from
Fletcher Challenge in 1992. The 1992 accounts included only six months'
profits from this subsidiary, the country's biggest lender to the farming
sector.
Lloyds Bank NZA, a 100 per cent owned Australian subsidiary of Lloyds Bank,
yesterday reported after-tax profits up 5.8 per cent to ADollars 8.2m
(USDollars 5.9m) in 1993 from ADollars 7.8m in 1992, AP-DJ reports from
Sydney.
Mr Tony Parkes, chairman, NZA, said profit has increased for three years in
a row.
