VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA; 
SCHOOL DISTRICT GETS $4,333 FROM LOTTERY 
Mupu Elementary School District of Santa Paula received $4,333 as its quarterly 
share of proceeds from state lottery sales, about the same amount received last 
year. 
"Most of the funds are earmarked for fine arts and student field trips," 
Principal Mark Stevens said at Monday's school board meeting. 
Previous lottery earnings have been paid to teachers as salary bonuses, Stevens 
said. 
In other business, the three-member school board also agreed to make the final 
$673 payment for a trip that seventh- and eighth-graders took last year to 
Astro Camp near Big Bear Lake. Donations and student fund-raisers financed the 
remainder of the trip, which cost nearly $4,000. 
The board also voted to allow girls' Mini Sox baseball practice on school 
grounds and made a formal request to purchase an awning for the school's lunch 
area. RUSS CHARVONIA
