 

(ii) Circumstances where waivers of audited financial statements may be granted include, but are not limited to,
the following: (A) the concern has an unexpected increase in sales towards the end of its fiscal year that creates an
unforeseen requirement for audited statements; (B) the concern unexpectedly experiences severe financial difficulties
which would make the cost of audited financial statements a particular burden; and (C) the concern has been an 8(a)
Program Participant less than 12 months.
(2) Program Participants with actual gross annual receipts of $1,000,000 to $4,999,999 shall submit to SBA reviewed
annual financial statements prepared by a licensed independent public accountant (as defined in part 107, Appendix
I,  II. B) within 90 days after the close of concern's fiscal year.
(3) Program Participants with actual gross annual receipts of less than $1,000,000 shall submit to SBA an annual statement
prepared in-house or compilation statement prepared by a licensed independent public accountant (as defined in
part 107, Appendix I,  II. B), verified as to accuracy by an authorized officer, partner, or sole proprietor
of the 8(a) concern, by signature and date, within 90 days after the close of the concern's fiscal year.
(4) Any audited financial statements submitted to SBA pursuant to 124.501(c) shall be prepared in accordance
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and reflect the independent public accountant's opinion.
(5) While financial statements need not be submitted until 90 or 120 days after the close of an 8(a) concern's fiscal
year, depending on the receipts of the concern, every 8(a) concern must submit a final sales report signed by the CEO
or President to SBA within 10 working days of the end of its fiscal year in order for SBA to determine/verify the concern's
size for 8(a) contract awards and compliance with competitive business mix targets. This report must show a breakdown
of 8(a) and non-8(a) sales.
(6) Audited or reviewed annual and/or quarterly statements may be required when SBA determines it is necessary to
obtain a more thorough verification of a concern's assets, liabilities, income and/or expenses, or to determine
the concern's capacity to perform a specific 8(a) contract.
(7) The requirements for submitting financial statements also apply to 8(a) joint venture agreements.
