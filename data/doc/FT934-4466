FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: MEPC shares hit by fall in net asset value
MEPC, the UK's second largest property company which completed a Pounds 222m
rights issue earlier this year, yesterday announced a fall of almost 15 per
cent in pre-tax profits from Pounds 95.2m to Pounds 81m for the year to
end-September.
The latest figure was struck after exceptional items of Pounds 13.2m,
including a Pounds 10m provision on interest rate hedging, compared with
Pounds 14.2m last time.
Earnings fell from 18.9p to 15.5p. Nevertheless, the group proposed a final
dividend of 14.75p, giving an unchanged total for the year of 20p.
Net asset value per share fell from 445p to 416p.
The shares closed 27p lower at 523p.
Lord Blakenham, chairman, said the net asset values did not reflect the
scale of the upturn in the market since they were prepared in August. 'We
believe we have seen the turning point in the UK property market,' he said,
citing much increased investor interest.
The company was in a far stronger position than a year ago, he said. After
property sales of Pounds 225m, a Pounds 150m preferred share issue and the
rights issue, gearing had fallen from 82 per cent to 48 per cent. The group
had cash of Pounds 211m (Pounds 89m).
After an external valuation, the group's overall valuation write-down was
1.1 per cent, while the investment properties rose in value by 3.1 per cent.
The group said 'substantial write-downs' had been incurred at Alban Gate in
the City and at a Tunbridge Wells shopping centre.
Mr James Tuckey, chief executive, said the group was very pleased with the
progress made on void properties, which were down to less than 5 per cent
compared with 8 per cent a year ago and 18 per cent two years ago.
Last month the group announced the proposed acquisition for Pounds 115m of
American Property Trust, a unit trust controlled by UK pension funds that
owns two shopping malls in Los Angeles and Atlanta. Completion of the deal
will lift the proportion of retail property in the MEPC portfolio from 27.5
per cent to 32.3 per cent, and reduce offices from 61.4 per cent to 57.3 per
cent.
COMMENT
The City was taken aback by the sharp fall in net asset values, which ended
well below the bottom of the expected 435p to 485p range. No figure was
given for the write-down on Alban Gate and Tunbridge Wells, but it appears
to be on the way to Pounds 100m. While it is worth noting that the
valuations were made last August, and the property market has shown signs of
recovery since, this is still an embarrassing figure. The dividend, which
remains uncovered, is the prop for the stock. Even if the recovery leads to
a rise in net asset values to over 500p next time, the shares are still at a
premium - and there is no prospect of dividend growth.
