FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: What it is and what it does
A repo is, in essence, a loan agreement between two parties, in which bonds
act as collateral.
The institution which owns the bonds sells them to the counterparty and in
return receives cash. At a set date in the future, the original bond owner
agrees to buy back the bonds for a set sum. The buy-back sum will be higher
than the original cash amount, with the difference reflecting the rate of
interest on the loan.
Both parties, in theory, can gain from this transaction. The original bond
owner gets finance at a cheaper rate than if it had borrowed without using
collateral. It can also raise cash without missing out on a potential rise
in the bond market.
Meanwhile, the lender receives interest at a better rate than if it had just
deposited the cash with a bank, and has the comfort of the bonds as security
for the loan. If an interest payment is made on the bond during the repo's
life, it will automatically be received by the counterparty. Normal practice
is for the counterparty to pay it back to the original owner.
A repo market would allow investors to go short of gilts, that is, speculate
that prices are due to fall. Investors go short by selling bonds they do not
own. To do so, they need to be able to deliver bonds to the buyer. They
could do this in a repo market by borrowing bonds and agreeing to sell them
back at a future date.
For the investor going short, this is a cheap way of financing a speculative
position; for those lending the bonds, this is a way of earning extra income
on their holdings.
