FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Axa may seek listings on leading
exchanges
Axa, one of France's largest insurance groups, is considering seeking stock
exchange quotations in London, Tokyo and New York over the next two years,
the company said yesterday.
Mr Claude Bebear, chairman, said he was keen to broaden the shareholder base
and obtain listings in other countries where the company has significant
interests.
The operation is also aimed at raising capital to develop operations
overseas.
Axa is already in advanced talks with the New York Stock Exchange over a US
listing. It is in negotiations over the accounting requirements that would
be demanded by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr Bebear said he was also keen to issue shares in the UK and Japan. 'We are
seen as a French company. We want to show that we are becoming more and more
global,' he said.
He would not give details of the size of the potential new share capital,
but said it would make sense for Axa's stock market capitalisations to be
proportionate to the amount of business it did in a given market.
Mr Bebear said he was also in talks about raising between Dollars 100m and
Dollars 200m through other forms of financial instruments next year.
However, he stressed the company had access to facilities of about FFr30bn
(Dollars 5.7bn) if it needed to make quick decisions about potential
acquisitions.
He confirmed the company was seriously evaluating potential acquisitions
overseas, but refused to be more specific.
However, Axa is known to be particularly interested in further expansion in
Europe and Asia.
Axa recently began operating in Japan. It has also opened a representative
office in Beijing and is investing Dollars 10m in a joint venture in Turkey.
