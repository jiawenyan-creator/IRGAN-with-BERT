FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Perloff offer for Etonbrook lapses
Mr Andrew Perloff has failed in his attempt to gain control of Etonbrook
Properties.
At the closing date of the 79p a share offer from two companies in which he
has an interest, Panther Securities and Multitrust, he controlled or had
acceptances for 57.27 per cent of the ordinary shares but only 44.86 per
cent of the voting shares.
The offer has lapsed leaving the companies with 42.33 per cent of the voting
shares.
Mr Perloff and his companies, however, have boardroom and management
control of Etonbrook.
