  [Text] Phnom Penh, May 1 (XINHUA) -- The round-table talks 
on Cambodia's national reconciliation scheduled for May 2 have 
been canceled due to disagreement on the meeting site. 
  Khieu Samphan, chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea Party, 
said in a telegraph to King Norodom Sihanouk today that the 
round-table should be held in a neutral place instead of Phnom 
Penh which he said can not guarantee the safety of the party's 
delegation. Khieu Samphan said that the round-table should be 
held in Pyongyang or elsewhere as the King proposed in his April 
24 telegraph. 
  However, King Sihanouk told Khieu Samphan in a telegraph 
yesterday that the co-prime ministers of the Cambodian 
Government agreed that Khieu Samphan and his delegation would 
stay in the palace to ensure their safety, but they were opposed 
to hold the round-table in a foreign country. 
  The round-table meeting was proposed by King Sihanouk on 
April 22, but the two sides failed to agree on a meeting place. 
  According to reports from Khmer Rouge, military 
confrontation 
continues in northwest part of the Cambodia this morning with 
Khmer Rouge capturing several towns.
