FT  28 OCT 92 / Beijing warns of HK slide towards chaos
CHINA yesterday predicted that Hong Kong would slide into chaos if Governor
Chris Patten refused to back down on his plans for democratic reform, Reuter
reports from Hong Kong.
In a blistering attack published in a Beijing-controlled newspaper, China's
top official responsible for the colony, Lu Ping, promised to fight Mr
Patten to the end over his proposal to let Hong Kong people elect the
majority of their legislature for the first time.
'Should Patten go on doing it his own way, there will certainly be big chaos
in Hong Kong,' the newspaper quoted Lu as saying.
'I can tell everybody that we are now determined to persist with Mr Patten
till the end if that's what he wants,' said Lu, who is director of the Hong
Kong and Macau Affairs Office.
Lu's attack is the latest in a media onslaught begun within minutes of Mr
Patten announcing his proposals on October 7.
Most attacks were anonymous or attributed to relatively junior officials.
But last Friday, shortly after Mr Patten left Beijing after his first visit
as governor, Lu broke his silence by threatening to overturn the Legislative
Council, the advisory cabinet and the judiciary once China takes control in
1997 if Mr Patten refused to back down.
The governor has denied encouraging social turmoil or political unrest. But
in remarks clearly aimed at Lu, he said some people might be trying to do
just that.
He has also consistently challenged China to put forward counter-proposals.
But Lu said: 'I waited more than half a month for Patten to come without
saying a word about his political speech. But during the six-hour meeting, I
talked most of the time and Patten didn't even say a word like 'we will
consider it'.'
