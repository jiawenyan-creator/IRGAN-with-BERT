CYPRESS DOWNS DEVELOPMENT BALLOTING TODAY 
The polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. today in Cypress as voters decide 
the fate of the controversial Cypress Downs development, a proposed 167-acre 
business and recreational complex surrounding Los Alamitos Race Track. 
The only item on the special election ballot asks Cypress' 23,491 voters 
whether a zone change should be approved for one of the largest remaining open 
spaces in northwestern Orange County. 
Supporters of the project spent more than $215,000 in a mail and publicity 
campaign, all but about $645 of the money contributed by SDC Co., the Newport 
Beach firm that will buy and develop the land if the measure passes. 
The opponents, Concerned Citizens of Cypress for Greenbelt and Open Spaces 
Preservation, raised only $25,989, which was less than its $38,870 campaign 
debts. They contend that the Cypress Downs development will increase traffic 
and lower property values. Under present zoning laws, the land may be developed 
only for public or semipublic uses.
