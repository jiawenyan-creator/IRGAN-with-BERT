FT  31 OCT 92 / International Company News: Daishowa Paper shortfall deepens
DAISHOWA PAPER, Japan's second largest paper manufacturer which is facing
large debts due to over-expansion, recorded a deepening in its interim
pre-tax loss due to sluggish demand and a sharp fall in gains on securities
sales.
The company said pre-tax losses for the first six months to September
increased to Y10bn (Dollars 81m) from Y3.7bn in the same period last year.
Daishowa's sales fell 12.8 per cent to Y157.8bn, due to the slack paper
market. The company will skip its dividend payment for the first time since
it listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1961.
After-tax losses totalled Y11bn, compared with a profit of Y287m. Daishowa
blamed its failure to sell its holdings of forest land and other assets
because of the current real estate slump.
As of September, Daishowa's debts stood at Y465bn, up from Y200bn in March.
The company plans to repay Y42.5bn by selling land and stock holdings, and
from the proceeds of its share allotment to Mr Ryoei Saito, honorary
chairman.
For the whole year, Daishowa expects to post a pre-tax loss of Y14.6bn on a
0.3 per cent fall in sales to Y348bn.
Honshu Paper, another leading paper company, said pre-tax profits fell 19.9
per cent to Y2.6bn on a 5.3 per cent decline in sales to Y197.1bn. After-tax
profits, however, increased 8.4 per cent to Y1.8bn due to profits from asset
sales.
For the full year to March, Honshu expects the slump in the paper market to
continue, and projects an 11 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y5.6bn on a
3.8 per cent fall in sales to Y397bn.
