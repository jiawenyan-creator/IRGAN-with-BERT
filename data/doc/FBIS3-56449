  [Text] Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, a State Duma deputy 
representing the Yavlinskiy bloc and ex-chairman of the former 
parliament's Committee for International Affairs and Foreign 
Economic Relations, told Interfax that he understood and to some 
extent shared Yegor Gaydar's reaction. 
  Ambartsumov said that spending on the construction of a 
parliamentary center was absolutely impossible because it would 
put a heavy burden on the tax-payers. 
  Ambartsumov noted at the same time, that Gaydar's decision 
pointed to growing rifts in the democratic camp, which weakened 
its positions and gave more freedom to Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin. 
  In such a situation the president will have to increase his 
role of a judge standing above various political groupings, he 
said. He also noted that the idea of establishing a 
presidential party had no prospects for the moment. Plans to 
create such a party were announced by the president some time 
ago.
