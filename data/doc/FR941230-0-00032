 Final rule; correction.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document corrects a citation in a final regulation establishing a safety standard for certain cigarette lighters
that requires the lighters to meet specified criteria so the lighters will resist operation by young children. 16
CFR part 1210. The regulations were published at 58 FR 37554 (July 12, 1993). 


Section 1210.12 of the regulation requires manufacturers (including importers) of lighters subject to the rule
to issue a certificate that the lighters comply with the applicable standard. Section 1210.12(b) contains requirements
for the contents of the certificate of compliance. Section 1210.12(b)(3) states that the certificate shall contain
``***, if different from the address in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the address of the place
of manufacture.'' However, paragraph (c)(2) does not contain a requirement for an address, and the reference actually
should be to paragraph (b)(2).
