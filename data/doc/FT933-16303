FT  05 JUL 93 / Parties find common cause in reform: Election pledges of
change will reflect mounting public disquiet over the political system
THE next Japanese government will attempt a sweeping reform of Japan's
political system.
Political reform is the main campaign issue for the July 18 general
election. All the opposition parties, old and new, are committed to the
process. And the ruling Liberal Democratic party is almost certain to
endorse it after the election. Last month's no-confidence vote was provoked
by the party's opposition to reform; the government lost and was taught a
painful lesson.
Yet political reform means different things to the various parties.
Proposals range from a limited tightening of regulations on political
funding to measures which could change the way Japan is governed.
Pressure for change has been mounting steadily. The Japanese public has been
growing increasingly disillusioned with corruption and Japan's business and
bureaucratic elites are concerned that the parochial, slow-moving system of
government makes Japan ill-equipped to play a larger international role.
Yet in the short run the debate has stemmed from more base motives. The real
battles of Japanese politics - fierce rivalries between leading politicians
 -are being played out through arguments over reform.
The proposals for change come in three main categories.
Electoral reform. The difficulties of cleaning up political funding have
focused attention on reform of Japan's distinctive electoral system, which
dates from 1925. The electoral system is widely blamed for the corruption
and parochialism of Japanese politics.
The 511-strong lower house of parliament is elected from about 130 large
election districts, most of which return between three and five members of
parliament.
To win a majority a party must run more than one candidate in each district.
So LDP and Social Democratic party candidates compete with one another as
well as against the opposition. To do this they need to maintain expensive,
personal support groups.
As it is difficult for a candidate to be distinguished from party colleagues
by ideology and policy, the candidate usually offers to bring public
spending projects to the constituency. The main qualities most Japanese
politicians offer their electorate are the skills and power to win favours
from the government bureaucracy in Tokyo.
A politician needs the support of about 15 per cent of the electorate to win
a seat, so if he targets his efforts repeatedly at the same sectional
interests he will be re-elected.
The system creates both supply and demand for corruption. The donations come
from construction companies which want politicians to press their case in
bidding for public contracts and politicians want the money to maintain
their local support groups. This does not merely make Japanese politics
corrupt. It minimises the role of policy debates in distinguishing between
candidates.
The multi-member electoral system is a prime target for reform. However, the
proposals largely reflect the interests of the party putting them forward.
The LDP old guard proposed switching to a system of smaller constituencies,
each electing a single member. Their reasoning was simple: as the largest,
richest party the LDP would probably win a majority of the seats.
The younger reformers within the party and the opposition want a system
which mixes 275 single-seat constituencies with a 225-seat proportional
representation system, designed to protect the interests of smaller parties.
A voter would cast two votes, one for their local single-seat constituency
and one in a ballot covering a wider prefectural area by proportional
representation.
It is not easy to predict how such a system would affect the parties'
standings. After the last general election in 1990 the Asahi Shimbun
newspaper published 20 computer simulations of possible outcomes under
different voting systems. The LDP won a resounding victory in all but four
simulations, when the main gains were in the Japan Communist party's favour.
Funding. All parties claim they want tougher controls on political funding
to eliminate widespread corruption in the form of illicit corporate
donations to individual politicians.
Politics in Japan is extremely expensive. Even though LDP candidates are not
allowed to buy television advertising, each spends at least Dollars 500,000
(Pounds 333,300) on their campaign and about Dollars 60,000 a month on
office expenses.
LDP politicians mainly raise this from corporate donations. But even after
sweeping reform of the political funds law in 1975, Japanese politicians
consistently find loopholes in regulations which were meant to clean up
their finances.
The reform limited contributions which could be made to individual
politicians. In response the politicians set up a multitude of supposedly
independent organisations, which receive funds on their behalf. Drinks
parties, the tickets for which sell for about Y30,000 (Pounds 190) a time,
are popular because businesses can treat the tickets as a taxable expense
rather than a political contribution. It is not uncommon for a politician to
sell 2,000 tickets for a hall which only accommodates 900 people.
Reform of political financing will develop in two directions. First,
stricter controls on corporate donations to individual politicians and more
openness in general donations to party organisations. Second, increased
government funding, which is limited to the costs of printing posters and
the running costs of a campaign car.
Urban voters. Japan's urban voters, who tend to be more cosmopolitan and
less influenced by pork barrel politics, are significantly under-represented
in the parliament. The disparities between rural and urban seats are huge.
In the last election Kanagawa District Four had 336,859 voters per MP, while
Miyazaki District Four had 105,939. At the extreme, one rural vote was worth
three urban votes. Some candidates won with only 45,000 votes while others
lost with 122,000.
The over-representation of rural districts is estimated to give the LDP a
30-seat advantage. The Social Democratic party is also more strongly
represented in rural areas than in cities.
Rebalancing the electoral districts so that urban voters are fairly
represented would shift the balance of power in favour of younger centrist
parties such as Komeito and the Japan New Party and away from both
traditional parties.
The combination of political reform, the LDP's split, declining urban
support for the Socialists and the rise of new centrist parties could change
the map of Japanese politics.
Yet there will be important continuities. The local, highly personalised
character of Japanese politics is like the root system of a tree. It is
deeply embedded in Japanese society and will not change quickly.

JAPAN: MAKING THE CHOICE
 ------------------------------------------------------
Population:                          123m
Electorate:                         93.4m
Parliamentary seats (lower house):   511
 ------------------------------------------------------
THE LEFT
 ------------------------------------------------------
SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (SDP)
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party Leader: Sadao Yamahana
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party still known in Japanese as the Socialist party:
the name change in English was easier than changes to
the party's Marxist/Leninist-flavoured policies. Party
pragmatists want fresh policies and hope to form a
vaguely left-of-centre government. Party idealogues see
ruling as irrelevant but are proudly devoted to
traditional beliefs.
 ------------------------------------------------------
JAPAN COMMUNST PARTY
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party Leader: Tetsuzo Fuwa
 ------------------------------------------------------
The least corruptible party because it is funded by
individual contributions rather than corporations.
Continues to defy history by espousing Marxism, and
electoral logic by running a candidate in every
district regardless of their prospects. The latter
helps to take votes away from the other opposition
parties, who cold-shoulder it.
 ------------------------------------------------------
THE CENTRE
 ------------------------------------------------------
KOMEITO (CLEAN GOVERNMENT PARTY)
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party Leader: Koshiro Ishida
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party created by the Buddhist movement Soka Gakkai to
represent its political interests. Now claims
independence but closely linked to the movement.
Conservative in nature. Assured of the votes of the
Buddhist faithful, so tends to do relatively well if
election turnout low. Close to LDP factions and has
supported ruling party on important issues.
 ------------------------------------------------------
DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party Leader: Keigo Ouchi
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party originally an offshoot from the Socialist Party
but has acted much like a faction of the ruling LDP.
Policies are indistinct but generally conservative.
Party members tend to support the LDP when it needs
extra parliamentary voting numbers. Has in the past
attracted LDP voters wanting to register mild rebuke to
the government.
 ------------------------------------------------------
SHAMINREN (UNITED SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY)
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party Leader: Satsuki Eda
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party is small pro-reform group trying to broaden its
power base by poaching members of the SDP, which is
frustrated by its inability to reform itself. Eda, one
of a long line of political Edas, has established a
separate political study group Sirius with SDP members.
This grouping could become yet another new party.
 ------------------------------------------------------
THE RIGHT
 ------------------------------------------------------
LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (LDP)
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party Leader: Kiichi Miyazawa
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party has held power since its formation in 1955
through the merger of two conservative parties. Its
anti-communism and willingness to shelter beneath the
umbrella of US foreign policy have been as enduring as
its symbiotic relationship with business and the
bureaucracy, the fierce rivalry among the leaders of
its warring factions and its recurrent financial
scandals.
 ------------------------------------------------------
SHINSEITO (JAPAN RENEWAL PARTY)
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party Leader: Tsutomu Hata
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party formed last month by rebel LDP faction that
brought down government in no-confidence motion. Hata,
the former finance minister, is popular, but his
offsider, Ichiro Ozawa, the former LDP fund manager, is
regared with suspicion. Party is middle-of-road but
perhaps slightly to the right. Still, it talks of
coalition with Socialists.
 ------------------------------------------------------
JAPAN NEW PARTY
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party Leader: Morihiro Hosokawa
 ------------------------------------------------------
Hosokawa, popularly known as Lord Hosokawa, is the
scion of one of Japan's oldest families and the darling
of the media. He calls for a 'power shift' to break up
Japanese politics but is short on specific policies. He
is close to the New Harbinger Party and loathes Ichiro
Ozawa, co-leader of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party)
 ------------------------------------------------------
NEW HARBINGER PARTY
 ------------------------------------------------------
Party Leader: Masayoshi Takemura
 ------------------------------------------------------
Splinter group formed last month from the LDP. The
Party has been searching for coalition partners, as its
10 parliamentarians felt vulnerable after their exit
from the ruling party. Policies are similar to LDP,
though the party has been purposefully vague,
suggesting that it is 'neither for or against the LDP'.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
One seat has been cut from the house of representatives, leaving 511
seats up for election this time. The LDP had 275 seats when the lower
house was dissolved on June 18. Of the 275 members, 48 have since left
the party.
