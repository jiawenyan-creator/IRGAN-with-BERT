HARASSMENT AT NAVAL ACADEMY 
The command structure at Annapolis that countenanced the climate that led to 
the outrageous attack on Dreyer, then winked at the perpetrators, should be 
immediately reassigned. 
As for those "good-natured" midshipmen, participants and the gawkers who could 
have stopped the stupidity, let them see what it's like to be ordinary seamen 
for a year or two. Maybe by then they will have a better understanding of the 
damage they have done to Ms. Dreyer and be more worthy of becoming officers.
