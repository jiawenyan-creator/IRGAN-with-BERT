CURRENT PAPERBACKS: BEST EDITORIAL CARTOONS OF THE YEAR 1989 EDITION EDITED BY 
CHARLES BROOKS (PELICAN: $9.95) 
The 17th collection in this series fails to live up to its title for the same 
reason as the previous installments. The most innovative cartoonists in the 
United States tend to be liberals; Brooks prefers conservative ideology to 
artistic excellence. 
Of the 14 cartoonists who have won the Pulitzer Prize since the series began, 
only six are included. Pat Oliphant, Herb Block (Herblock), Tony Auth, Jeff 
MacNelly and Don Wright are conspicuously absent. In their place, Brooks 
presents derivative, second- and third-rate work that lacks the incisive edge 
needed to fix an image in the reader's mind. The weakest drawings also reflect 
fuzzy thinking: One cartoon calls for a "happy medium" between "The Polluters' 
World" and "The Environmentalists' World," which suggests that certain levels 
of pollution may be desirable. 
This anthology will entertain hard-line conservatives, but it fails to present 
the best of American political cartooning.
