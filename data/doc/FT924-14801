FT  08 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Thatcher scorns
'ruinous' treaty
THE 'ruinous' Maastricht treaty and the 'unbearable' exchange rate mechanism
should be abandoned in favour of an economic policy that 'puts British needs
first', Lady Thatcher declares today in an unrestrained broadside on the
government.
Britain requires 'an economic strategy which works with markets, not against
them, is realistic and sustainable, and provides a framework for growth,'
Lady Thatcher says in The European newspaper. She calls for a return to the
policy of domestic monetary control that 'worked throughout most of the
1980s'.
'The ERM and Maastricht are inextricably linked,' the former prime minister
writes. 'The first is a prerequisite to the fulfilment of the second. We
found the confines of the first unbearable; the straitjacket of the second
would be ruinous.' The two were 'part of the vision of yesterday'.
She says the government should have left the ERM 'once we realised (it)
lacked the flexibility we expected and required.' Instead, 'we were forced
to keep up interest rates even though our recession at home was signalling
the need to reduce them'.
Homeowners and businessmen had 'paid a heavy price', she said, but 'at least
now we have the freedom to put those problems right'.
The Maastricht treaty's goal of European economic and monetary union looked
'even more impossible'. She would not regret a 'two-tier Europe', but said
the Maastricht economies might find themselves, not Britain, in the 'slow
lane' to economic growth.
