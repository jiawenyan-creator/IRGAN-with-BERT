FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: NationsBank lifted by one-time
benefit
NATIONSBANK, the south-eastern US regional banking group formed in 1991 by
the merger of C &amp; S Sovran and NCNB, has unveiled a 55 per cent jump in
first-quarter 1993 net profits to Dollars 481m, or Dollars 1.89 a share.
The results were inflated by a one-time Dollars 200m benefit stemming from
accounting changes.
NationsBank, the fourth-largest US banking group, disclosed that its
non-performing assets totalled Dollars 1.92bn at the end of the first
quarter, equivalent to 2.53 per cent of total loans, leases and foreclosed
property, and about 29 per cent below the non-performing level a year ago.
Bad debt provisions totalled Dollars 1.57bn, down from Dollars 1.66bn a year
ago. Provisions taken in the quarter were Dollars 120m, less than half the
Dollars 265m taken in the first quarter of 1992.
Net interest income was Dollars 1.09bn, up from Dollars 1.01bn a year ago.
Non-interest income was Dollars 481m, against Dollars 471m.
NationsBank, which owns Panmure Gordon, the UK stockbroker, said its tier
one ratio of capital to assets was 7.61 per cent, compared with 7.17 per
cent a year ago.
