FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Electrolux seeks to sell
subsidiary
Electrolux, the Swedish household appliances group, has decided to sell up
to all its shares in the wholly-owned subsidiary Electrolux Autoliv. It will
also apply for Autoliv's listing on the Stockholm stock exchange before the
end of June, AP-DJ reports from Stockholm.
Autoliv is the largest European manufacturer of safety belts, airbags and
other personal safety equipment for vehicles. In 1993, the company reported
a pre-tax profit of SKr300m (Dollars 37.5m) on sales of SKr5.3bn.
Electrolux has decided to sell Autoliv as part of its strategy to
concentrate on core operations. The group said it also wanted to strengthen
its financial position to allow further acquisitions within its four core
areas: household appliances, commercial appliances, outdoor products and
industrial products.
