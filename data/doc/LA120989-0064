TV REVIEWS; 
'MONEY, POWER, MURDER' JUST CAN'T CARRY THE PLOT 
The made-for-TV movie "Money, Power, Murder" promises in its title almost 
everything in the ratings sun except sex and rich chocolate treats. 
This CBS endeavor (9 p.m. Sunday on Channels 2 and 8) stars Kevin Dobson as 
smart but wise-aleck, clever but unorthodox, tough but heart-o'-gold reporter 
Peter Finley, who works for a small but feisty New York cable news operation. A 
good, breezy character. 
He sets about covering the disappearance of hot-eyed and hot-rated (but hotly 
despised) network anchorwoman Peggy Ann Brady (Julianne Moore). Then a lot of 
people start showing up dead. 
There's some money, power and murder here, and a little sex, too, between Peter 
and his ex-wife (Blythe Danner). 
As written by New York Daily News sportswriter Mike Lupica from his book of the 
same name, the script gives Dobson a lot more snappy patter than is needed. 
Likewise, he gives us more incredible plot than is needed and it stumbles over 
itself before falling down of its own weight. 
It proves that money, power and murder aren't enough anymore. IRV LETOFSKY
