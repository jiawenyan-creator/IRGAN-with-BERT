The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
Ferrantelli, 25001 Dana Point Harbor Drive, Dana Point. (714) 493-1401. Open 
Mondays through Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Sundays through Thursdays 5:30 
to 10, Fridays and Saturdays till 11. 
 Ferrantelli is an engaging dockside pasta house that doesn not take a lot of 
chances but offers solid meals. The house antipasto, a stunning palette of 
color and taste, gives an idea of the type of effort the kitchen puts in with 
its limited skill. Pastas are fine too, made fresh daily by Pasta Mia and 
embellished with a variety of good sauces. But the veal dishes are tasteless, 
and main courses are often too sweet. 
Yankee Tavern, 333 Bayside Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 675 5333. Open nightly 
5:30 to midnight. 
 Those who know Yankee Tavern owner Hans Prager as proprietor of the Ritz may 
be surprised to see him in this urban roadhouse, catering to a crowd hungry for 
low prices, speedy service and an unpretentious menu. The food here is almost 
unfailingly good.
