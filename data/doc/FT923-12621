FT  17 JUL 92 / Shortfall in Maxwell funds may be Pounds 434m
THE SHORTFALL in the Maxwell pension funds is at least Pounds 248m and could
be as high as Pounds 434m, according to one of the funds' liquidators.
Mr Neil Cooper, head of corporate recovery at chartered accountants Robson
Rhodes, said last night that, of the total funds managed by Bishopsgate
Investment Management, the liquidators now had assets of Pounds 248m under
their control
BIM was the private company that managed most of the Pounds 700m in the
pension funds of the public companies of the late Robert Maxwell on behalf
of 30,000 past and present pensioners.
Mr Cooper said that disregarding the proceeds of legal actions, the
shortfall was now Pounds 434m on the basis that no more was recovered from
institutions holding investments. This would fall to Pounds 248m if all the
investments were recovered for the benefit of the pensioners. These figures
ignored the government's 'soft loan' package of Pounds 2.5m.
