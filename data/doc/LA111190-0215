THE TIMES' 17TH ANNUAL WINE TASTING; 
VINS EXTRAORDINAIRES 
THE LOS ANGELES Times Magazine's 17th Annual Wine Tasting is a bonanza for 
connoisseurs seeking excellent wines at affordable prices. There's nary a 
disappointment among the 36 top-ranking critics' choices. 
The assignment this year -- to choose from among 73 highly reputable wines from 
six leading wine-exporting countries plus California -- had a twist: All the 
wines were priced at $20 or less. They would not be tasted comparatively. 
Instead, each country's entries would be judged on their own merits, for both 
quality and value. So that the daylong blind tasting would not become a 
guessing contest, the judges were given the grape origin (i.e., Chardonnay, 
Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Noir) and the retail selling price of each wine. To our 
knowledge, this is an international first in critical evaluation in a wine 
competition. 
Fifteen judges, using the 20-point scale (20 being the best score), took the 
cost of the wine into consideration before giving it an A for fair value, AA 
for good value or AAA for outstanding value. The number of entries from each 
country is indicated, but only the winners are rated. 
And now, the results, which may be of help in shopping for holiday feasting and 
gift giving.
