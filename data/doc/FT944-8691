FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Brockhampton advances to Pounds 3.77m
Pre-tax profits at Brock-hampton Holdings, the parent of Portsmouth Water,
rose from Pounds 3.43m to Pounds 3.77m in the six months to September 30,
though it said that the second half might be weaker than the first.
The shares fell 10p to 373p yesterday.
Turnover advanced to Pounds 13.8m (Pounds 12.7m), reflecting the 3.4 per
cent overall rise in charges and a one-off increase in measured revenue
arising from the switch to monthly billing of large commercial customers.
The pre-tax figure would have been greater but for the costs of upgrading
computer equipment committed in late-1993 and by a front-loaded mains
renewal programme. The company said this would be less severe in the second
half.
Earnings per share emerged at 31.3p (30.5p) and the interim dividend is held
at 3p.
