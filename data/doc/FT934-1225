FT  21 DEC 93 / Proposals made for development of security links
Britain and Italy yesterday proposed the development of possible security
links between the EU and east European countries to anchor them more closely
to the west in an unstable period, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The plan was presented to EU foreign ministers by Italian foreign minister
Beniamino Andreatta. Mr Willy Claes, foreign minister of Belgium, the EU
president, said: 'Particularly in the light of elections in Russia and
uncertainty in Ukraine, it is obvious that anxiety is growing in central
Europe and the Baltics, so we need to give a clear sign of our support to
these countries.'
