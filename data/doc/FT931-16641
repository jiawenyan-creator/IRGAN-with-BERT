FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons buys central London pub
Allied-Lyons, the food and drinks company, was yesterday named as the
purchaser of the Old Thameside Inn, the central London pub sold for pounds
1.2m by Harmony Leisure, the loss-making pubs and restaurants group.
Harmony said the sale would significantly reduce its gearing. The decision
to dispose of the pub follows Harmony's qualified annual accounts for the
year to March 29 1992 in which Barclays, concerned at the group's borrowing,
insisted on a substantial loan repayment in January this year.
