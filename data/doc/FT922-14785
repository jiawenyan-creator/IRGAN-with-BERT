FT  04 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies
Doubtless Sir Alan Walters thinks Portugal is making a terrible mistake in
joining the ERM, but the escudo is too small to make much difference to the
other members. Certainly, another high interest rate currency should not be
too problematic for sterling which has managed to survive at its peseta
floor for months. What matters most is the floor against the D-Mark and that
is still six pfennigs away.
The British currency's weakness in the second half of this week owes as much
to D-Mark strength in the wake of high German inflation figures and the
anaemic US recovery as to domestic politics. Talk of higher base rates is
premature to say the least. The markets may be looking for a display of
determination immediately after the election, but higher rates would only
become necessary if speculators actually sold sterling through its D-Mark
floor. That would be rash when all three leading parties are committed to
maintaining the DM2.95 central rate.
