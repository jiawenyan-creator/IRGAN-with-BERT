NATION IN BRIEF; 
MICHIGAN; 
PLEA BY ILL TEEN-AGE PRISONER IS DENIED 
Gov. James J. Blanchard of Michigan denied a request that he commute the prison 
sentence of a 16-year-old repeat offender with terminal cancer who wanted to be 
released from a prison hospital to die at home. Alan Rogers Jr. is serving a 4- 
to 10-year sentence for robbing and assaulting a retired police officer. He 
initiated the clemency request after doctors told him he had inoperable cancer 
and probably would die within a month. Blanchard asked the state Department of 
Corrections to explore other options to allow Rogers to return to his parents' 
home to die.
