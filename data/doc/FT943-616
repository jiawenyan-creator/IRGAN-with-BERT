FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Brixton Estate up at Pounds 16.4m
Improvements in rental income helped Brixton Estate turn in a 26 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to end June, up from Pounds
13m to Pounds 16.4m.
'The letting market picked up over the summer but has been especially strong
in the last six to eight weeks,' said Mr Terence Nagle, managing director.
'We are seeing demand from industrial companies who have suddenly found
themselves short of space.'
Brixton has let 400,000 sq ft of office and industrial space since January
and is negotiating on a further 160,000 sq ft.
If these negotiations are completed, the proportion of empty space in
Brixton's portfolio will fall from 7.5 per cent at the end of the last
financial year to 5.5 per cent.
However there was no sign of widespread increase in rents even though
vacancy rates were falling.
Net rental income increased from Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 33.2m in the six
months, reflecting additional lettings and acquisitions. Brixton spent
Pounds 50m acquiring properties during the period, bringing its outlay on
acquisitions to Pounds 123m since its Pounds 100m rights issue in May 1993.
The average yield on acquired properties is 10.7 per cent, well above the
long-term cost of funds.
The company had been buying office and industrial property, concentrating on
London and the western half of the home counties.
In addition to acquisitions, work is about to start on the speculative
redevelopment of 136,000 sq ft in Birmingham and 69,000 sq ft of industrial
space in Woking.
Net interest costs were higher at Pounds 15.8m (Pounds 13.8m), although
interest capitalised on developments amounted to only Pounds 2.14m against
Pounds 4.46m last time. Administration expenses were Pounds 1.44m (Pounds
1.6m).
Earnings per share were 5.47p - or 5.28p excluding a Pounds 442,000 profit
on the sale of properties - against 5.5p. The interim dividend is increased
from 2.825p to 2.95p.
