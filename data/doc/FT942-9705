FT  14 MAY 94 / Australia defends military aid
Australia's federal government yesterday defended its right to provide
additional military assistance to Cambodia, in its struggle with the Khmer
Rouge guerrillas, despite reports of displeasure from officials in Thailand.
Senator Gareth Evans, the foreign minister,
said it was legitimate for the elected Cambodian goverment to seek
assistance from the international community in order to maintain the
country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Senator Evans said that the request was being seriously considered. Any
decision would be taken after consultation with 'other interested countries,
including Thailand'. Australia did not view the security situation in
Cambodia as 'in any way alarming'. 'In terms of overall territory held, the
situation is not significantly different from when the latest cycle of
military acitivity commenced some three months ago.
