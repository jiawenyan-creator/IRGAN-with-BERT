  [Text] Washington, June 15 (MTI) -- American President 
Bill Clinton will receive Hungarian President Arpad Goncz and 
Slovak President Michal Kovac, in the framework of a courtesy 
call, in Washington on Tuesday, June 21. This was announced by 
Hungarian Ambassador to the United States Pal Tar, who added 
that the White House has officially confirmed the meeting. 
According to Tar, the friendly and informal meeting has no 
pre-set agenda. 
  Goncz and Kovac will both be paying a private visit to the 
United States at the invitation of the Institute for East-West 
Studies. The institute will confer honours on the two presidents 
in recognition of their activity for international understanding 
and cooperation. 
  Speaking to reporters in Washington, Ambassador Tar 
discussed 
the reasons for his resignation, which has since been accepted 
by the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, and will take effect from 
July 5. Tar said he accepted the post at the request of the 
Antall government three years ago because he felt he could serve 
Hungary with his professional skills, although he had no earlier 
diplomatic or public-service posts. 
  "I agreed with the Antall government's foreign policy, and 
helped in working it out. This period has now ended, and I have 
asked to be relieved accordingly," Tar said. The ambassador 
said his decision does not imply any sort of problem of 
conscience or reservations with the new government now being set 
up, as it will be a democratically-elected leadership that is 
committed to democracy.
