FT  24 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: A bond issue with a twist
As new issues of Latin American bonds continued thick and fast last week,
the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais launched on Friday a Eurobond issue with
twist.
The issue - which Banque Indosuez, its arranger, says is the first sovereign
bond issue from Brazil since 1980 - carries warrants entitling holders to
buy preferred shares in the state-owned electricity company, Cemig.
The issuer is doubtless hoping to benefit from the current Brazilian 'rosy
scenario' which - for all the doubts about it coming to pass - has
apparently been driving the Brazilian stock market's remarkable rally this
month.
Under this, finance minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso succeeds in pushing
through an economic package which brings down inflation. This so adds to his
prestige that he wins this year's presidential election. He also manages to
close Brazil's debt deal with foreign banks by the deadline of April 15,
thereby improving Cemig's own debt profile.
Minas Gerais is issuing Dollars 200m of bonds, Dollars 100m with a five-year
maturity and Dollars 100m with a six-year maturity. The five-year bonds
carry a 7 7/8 per cent coupon and the six-year an 8 1/4 per cent coupon. The
conversion premium on the three-year warrants is 30 per cent over the
weighted average price of the preferred over the last month on the Sao Paulo
stock exchange.
The preferred shares are the eighth most liquid in Sao Paulo, and the
warrant offer represents about 5 per cent of outstanding shares. Cemig
generates about 8 per cent of Brazil's electricity.
Bombril, a household cleaning products manufacturer, placed Dollars 150m of
paper in August, in Brazil's first international equity warrants issue.
