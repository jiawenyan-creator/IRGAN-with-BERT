FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Windsor Pounds 1.1m in the red
Windsor, the insurance broker which specialises in sports, leisure and
contingency insurance, yesterday announced a 75 per cent increase in
operating profits for the year to September 30, but incurred pre-tax losses
of Pounds 1.11m after provisions and charges of Pounds 1.82m.
Losses per share - reported under FRS 3 - were 3.93p against earnings of
1.69p.
Some Pounds 1.7m in provisions were incurred as a result of writing down the
market value of an investment property - a 25,000 sq ft office block - in
Hemel Hempstead to Pounds 1.5m.
Windsor has now lost more than Pounds 2m on the property which it acquired
in 1989.
Mr Mike Eagles, chief executive, who has headed an extensive reorganisation
since he joined the group in 1991, said he was now confident about selling
the property.
He pointed to a strong underlying growth in business, especially in areas
like professional indemnity, and a 10 per cent growth in revenues to Pounds
8.4m.
