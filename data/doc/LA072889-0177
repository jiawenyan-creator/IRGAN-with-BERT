FORMER COACH DENIES HE KNEW OF INELIGIBILITY 
A former Howard University football coach at the center of a growing scandal 
over players who apparently played after their four-year college eligibility 
had expired has said he never intentionally used ineligible players. 
As many as one-third of the players on the Howard team have been told they have 
one less year of eligibility than originally thought going into the 1989 
season, school officials have said. 
The eligibility foul-up apparently affects about 30 players recruited for the 
Bison under former coach Willie Jeffries, Howard deputy counsel Francis Smith 
said Thursday. 
Jeffries, contacted Thursday, said he was told he was told three players Howard 
attorneys have asked him about were eligible. 
"The records we were shown indicated they had not played before" 1984, he said. 
When he went to Washington in mid-June to give a deposition to Howard 
attorneys, "they asked me about the three players and the financial aid 
irregularities," he said from his Orangeburg, S.C., office. 
"The records we were shown indicated they had not played before. We thought 
they were redshirt freshmen. To our knowledge they only played four years. They 
said they had not played in 1983." 
The school has said it is investigating irregularities in the Bison football 
program under Jeffries over four years.
