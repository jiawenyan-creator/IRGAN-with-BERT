A former Notre Dame lineman, Steve Huffman, claims in a magazine report that 
there was widespread steroid use on the football team and that Coach Lou Holtz 
"had to have known" about it. 
In this week's issue of Sports Illustrated, Huffman alleges that "almost half 
the lettermen at Notre Dame used steroids at some time." 
He also claims that some players sold the muscle-building drug, which is banned 
by the NCAA. 
Notre Dame officials denied Huffman's charges in a written statement issued by 
the university. 
Huffman, who had an injury-plagued career at Notre Dame before quitting the 
team during preseason practice in 1987, said two assistant coaches suggested 
that he take steroids to increase his strength. He did not name the coaches or 
any of the players who allegedly used steroids.
