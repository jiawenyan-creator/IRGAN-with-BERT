MAGIC, HEARN CHARGED WITH WRONG RESPONSE TO ARREST OF WORTHY 
I hope I'm not the first to advocate fairness in our consideration of James 
Worthy. A man's own conscience is generally sufficient judge, jury and sentence 
in a publicized occurrence of this kind. 
This particular event could have been handled privately and not subjected to 
the public domain were it not for the media's thirst for denigrating trivia.
