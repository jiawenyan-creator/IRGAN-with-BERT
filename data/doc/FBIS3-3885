  [Text] Taipei, March 24 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui is 
not likely to visit Russia in early April, a presidential office 
spokesman said Thursday [24 March]. 
  The spokesman made the statement after the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs confirmed it has received a letter from Russia's 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party inviting President Li to 
attend the party's fifth national congress scheduled to open 
April 2. 
  The spokesman said President Li is willing to visit any 
country as long as such visit is in the nation's interest. But, 
he said, it takes time to arrange Li's overseas trips. 
  "So I don't think it is feasible for our president to accept 
the Russian party's invitation at the moment," he noted. 
  Earlier in the day, a Foreign Ministry official said the 
invitation from Russia's largest opposition party lacks the 
necessary imprimatur of the Russian Government. 
  "It takes the Russian Government's endorsement before Li can 
visit," said Lo Jih-yuan, director of the ministry's West Asian 
Affairs Department. 
  "It remains unclear whether the Russian Government would 
approve our president's visit," Lo noted. Taiwan doesn't 
maintain diplomatic relations with Russia. 
  Li made unofficial visits to the Philippines, Indonesia and 
Thailand in February. Although the three Southeast Asian 
countries do not have diplomatic ties with Taiwan, they treated 
Li as a national guest. 
  The largest Russian opposition party said in its letter, 
signed by its chairman, the controversial Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
that its leaders hope to discuss with Li international affairs 
and prospects for Taiwan-Russian cooperation, particularly in 
economic and cultural fields. 
  It also said if Li cannot attend the party congress, he is 
welcome to visit Russia at any time.
