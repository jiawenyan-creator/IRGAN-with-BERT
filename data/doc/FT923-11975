FT  22 JUL 92 / People: Dunn's direct route
Alexander Dunn is to head a new direct motor insurance operation being
launched in the UK by the French Groupe des Assurances Nationales.
Dunn, a 39-year-old Scot who has spent 20 years with Eagle Star, helped
launch the company's direct sales arm in October 1988.
After three and half years at Eagle Star Direct, Dunn has become a firm fan
of direct sales methods, which uses a combination of mass media advertising,
computer-based underwriting systems and telephone sales to bypass the
broker, the industry's traditional middleman.
'From a business point of view it is the way the market is going. It is a
very immediate way of doing business. You can test the concept, see the
result and change strategy quickly if necessary,' he says.
GAN intends to invest Pounds 1m initially in software and hardware into the
operation, which is to be based in Portsmouth. Dunn is aiming for a 2.5 per
cent share of the UK motor market by 1997 and also envisages selling
household, personal accident and medical expenses cover by the direct route.
