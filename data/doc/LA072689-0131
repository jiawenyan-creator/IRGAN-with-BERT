LOCAL; 
SANTA ANA MAN HELD AFTER STANDOFF 
Special weapons and tactics deputies arrested an armed, distraught man early 
this morning after he had holed up in a Santa Ana-area garage Tuesday for an 
all-night standoff, according to a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department. 
Paul Jones Morgan, 47, was booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon 
after he allegedly fired several shots at his wife, then retreated to his 
home's garage, where he refused to come out and repeatedly threatened to kill 
himself, said Sheriff's Lt. Bob Rivas. 
About 9 p.m. Tuesday, deputies went to the home in the 12000 block of Dunas 
Road after receiving a report of shots being fired, Rivas said. After Morgan's 
wife and teen-age son escaped through a window, deputies called for Morgan to 
leave the detached garage. 
Crisis negotiators talked with Morgan through the night as the man waved a 
9-millimeter pistol and threatened suicide. About 7:10 a.m. today, SWAT 
deputies hurled flash-bang grenades into the garage to distract Morgan, then 
tackled him. Rivas said the man was reportedly distraught over marriage 
difficulties.
