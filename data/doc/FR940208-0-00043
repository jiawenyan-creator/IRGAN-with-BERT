 

a. Water quality measurement. 

Iowa proposes, at IAC 2740.36(5), to revise its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR 780.21(a) by adding the
following sentence at the end of the regulation: ``The methodology for measurement of the quantity of both surface
water and groundwater shall also be described.'' OSM interprets this to mean that such measurement methodologies
must be described in the permit application, although the State proposal does not explicitly so provide. The Federal
regulation at 30 CFR 780.21(a) requires that all water-quality analyses performed shall be conducted according
to the methodology in the 15th edition of ``Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater'' or the methodology
in 40 CFR Parts 136 and 434 but the regulation does not specify that the methodology for measurement of the quantity
of both surface water and groundwater shall also be described.

However, section 30 CFR 777.13(a) requires all technical data submitted in the application be accompanied by, among
other things, a description of the methodology used to collect and analyze the data. Iowa incorporates 30 CFR 777.13(a)
at IAC 2740.33(207). Hence, the addition of this proposed language simply reiterates the need for a description
of the methodology used. Therefore, The Director is approving Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 2740.36(5).

b. 

Water information requirements. 

Iowa proposes, at IAC 2740.36(6), to revise its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR 780.21(d) by deleting
the phrase ``may be required by the regulatory authority'' and replacing it with the phrase ``is required.'' The deleted
phrase provided the State with discretion whether to require actual surface and groundwater information be provided
when modeling techniques, interpolation or statistical techniques are included in the permit application. Iowa,
by removing this phrase, will now require the actual surface and groundwater information to be included in all permits
applications.

The Director finds that this is a matter left to the discretion of the State regulatory authority under the Federal
regulations. Accordingly, the Director finds this proposed revision at IAC 2740.36(6) to be no less effective
than the Federal regulations and is approving it.



20. IAC 2740.37(4), Cross Sections, Maps, and Plans



Iowa proposes to revise its rule at 2740.37(4) to correct a typographical error. The current language provides
that the first sentence in incorporated 30 CFR 783.24, dealing with informational requirements for underground
mining permit applications, is changed to read ``The permit application shall include cross sections at a vertical
exaggeration of 10:1, maps at a scale of 1:2400, and plans showing. ...'' The State provision thus
specifies more detailed requirements for cross sections and maps than are specified in the Federal regulations at
30 CFR 783.25(a). This State provision, along with IAC 2740.35(a), the parallel State provisions for surface
mining permit applications, was approved by OSM on November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56578, 5657956580), as a provision
that added specificity to the Iowa program without adversely affecting other aspects of the program.

Iowa, in its July 8, 1993, submission proposed to correct the provision to require cross sections with a vertical exaggeration
of 1:10, instead of 10:1. However, in revising the provision, Iowa inadvertently created another typographical
error by requiring cross sections with a vertical exaggeration of 10:11:10. Consequently, Iowa, in a letter dated
August 20, 1993, submitted an editorial clarification to is revised rule to clarify that the provision requires cross
sections with a vertical exaggeration of 1:10. OSM understands Iowa's intent to exaggerate the vertical scale of
a relief map or cross section in order to make the map or section more clearly perceptible. Therefore, in Iowa's case,
the scale of vertical representation is exaggerated 10 times compared to the horizontal.
