ARMY GROUNDS CH-47 COPTERS AFTER CRACKED PARTS ARE FOUND 
The Army announced Friday that it had grounded its fleet of Boeing CH-47D 
transport helicopters for safety inspections, one day after congressional 
investigators attacked alleged design problems in another type of Army 
helicopter. 
It was the second grounding of the CH-47s in eight months, this time for 
inspection of nuts used to lock the engine transmission to the frame. 
The Army said some cracked nuts were found during recent routine maintenance. 
The Army has experienced problems with a wide range of helicopters in the past 
two years and the Pentagon is now deciding whether to go ahead with a new 
multibillion-dollar program of light utility and scout helicopters. 
The General Accounting Office reported at a House hearing Thursday that the 
AH-64 Apache attack helicopters made by McDonnell Douglas Corp. had serious 
problems with rotor blades and malfunctioning electronic equipment. 
The GAO recommended that the Apache force be limited to 675 aircraft purchased 
or under contract instead of the proposed $12 billion fleet of 807, and that 
plans to upgrade the helicopter be deferred until the Army has dealt with 
problems in maintaining them. 
The CH-47D is produced by the Boeing-Vertol division of Boeing Co. 
The Army said it had ordered the grounding of all 290 helicopters in the fleet 
"because cracks have been found in the barrel nuts associated with the 
aircraft's forward transmission." Four of the nuts are used to secure the 
transmission to the body of the helicopter. 
The cracked nuts were discovered recently while being replaced on a CH-47D 
undergoing a normal maintenance operation. 
The Army said approximately 300 of the suspect barrel nuts were in the 
service's inventory and that the helicopters would be allowed to fly until the 
four nuts on each had been inspected.
