 

II. Public Reporting Burden 



The public reporting burden under FERC592, Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines, as revised by Order
Nos. 497D and 636, is expected to remain unchanged. Currently, the reporting burden is estimated to average
9.94 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering
and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Annual reporting requirements
under FERC592 are expected to total 7,882 hours, based on an estimated 793 responses from approximately 61
respondents. 

Issued concurrently with this order is a NOPR in Docket No. RM946000.

 The NOPR proposes to significantly reduce the FERC592 information reporting requirements and burden. Extending
the sunset date for FERC592 through June 30, 1994, will give interested parties and the Commission time to evaluate
the NOPR comments and allow the Commission time to prepare a final rule.

III. Background 



On July 21, 1992, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued its opinion in 

Tenneco,

 upholding in substantial part Order Nos. 497 and 497A. However, the court found that the Commission did not
adequately justify its extension of the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of 161.3(f) to gas sales
and marketing information. The court stated that ``[o]n remand the Commission should reconsider its justification
for applying [the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of 161.3(f)] to sales and marketing information
and ensure that the final requirement is reasonably tailored to meet the Commission's goals of improving the market
and benefitting consumers, as well as preventing undue discrimination.''

 In a related matter, the court stated that ``[a]pplying [the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of 161.3(f)]
to released-gas information prior to the issuance of Order No. 497A might well be fundamentally unfair'' and
that the Commission could avoid ``the expense of litigation over this issue by announcing that it will not retroactively
apply [161.3(f)] to released gas information.''

 Further, in its review of 

Ozark,

 the court found that the Commission erred in finding Order No. 497 applicable to Ozark, a joint venture partnership
composed of subsidiaries of four natural gas pipelines, each of which has a 25 percent ownership and voting interest.
The court stated that the Commission failed to consider relevant evidence regarding the ability of the owner pipelines
with affiliates to control the partnership.

On December 4, 1992, in response to the court's opinion in 

Tenneco,

 the Commission issued Order No. 497D, an order on remand and extending sunset date. Based upon the court's opinion,
and in light of the structural changes in the gas industry that were to occur as a result of Order No. 636, the Commission
revised 161.3(f) to narrow the scope of the contemporaneous disclosure requirement with respect to sales
and marketing information. Under revised standard (f), pipelines are still required to contemporaneously disclose
information related to transportation of natural gas. However, with respect to information related to gas sales
or marketing, pipelines are only required to disclose information relating to sales or marketing on its system or
the system of an affiliated pipeline. There are two categories of gas sales or marketing information that are not required
to be contemporaneously disclosed: (1) Gas sales or marketing information that is available from public sources
and (2) information related to gas sales off a pipeline's system, but not involving the system of an affiliated pipeline.
Section 161.3(f) now reads:
