FT  29 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean labour row boosts
copper - Week in the Markets
THE COPPER market provided the main bright spot at the London Metal Exchange
this week, with prices climbing to 2 1/2 -month highs.
The rise, which left the cash quotation Pounds 34.25 up at Pounds 1,295.50 a
tonne, got under way on Monday following news of labour problems at the
world's biggest underground copper mine, the Chilean Copper Corporation's
(Codelco's) El Teniente. Output was affected that day as 2,000 of the 9,000
workers downed tools in protest at the sacking last weekend of 150 miners.
There have been no stoppages since then and talks have been held between
management and union leaders. Codelco said these had reached 'positive
agreements', but hardline unions said they had not called off the protest
plan. The possibility of further disruption helped to keep the upward
pressure on copper prices at the LME, although that was partly
counterbalanced towards the end of the week by talk that Russia had reduced
duties on metal exports. London traders said yesterday they had no precise
clarification on this but said it appeared that some revisions had been
made, notably for crude nickel exports. No reductions had been announced for
refined nickel or copper, the traders said, but they thought refined
aluminium from the Krasnoyarsk and Bratsk smelters might have been exempted
from export duty.
Both nickel and aluminium prices fell quite sharply in response. Cash nickel
closed at Dollars 7,665 a tonne, down Dollars 250 on the day and Dollars 305
on the week. Cash aluminium was down Dollars 20 on the day at Dollars
1,298.50 a tonne, but that was still Dollars 3.50 up on the week.
Sentiment in the aluminium market had earlier benefitted from copper's
strength as a continuation of the recent rise lifted the cash price to a
seven-month high of Dollars 1,322.50 on Wednesday. The announcement on
Tuesday of a 20,450-tonne rise in LME warehouse stocks was shrugged off in
the market, but in yesterday's bearish mood a further rise of 7,975 tonnes -
to a record 1,115,050 tonnes - added to the downward pressure, though it was
in line with expectations.
Zinc prices recovered some of their recent losses this week after force
majeure was declared on shipments from Peru's biggest zinc refinery,
Cajamarquilla. Minero Peru, the state company that owns the refinery, said
output was being cut by power rationing. Last year Cajamarquilla produced
93,000 tonnes of zinc.
A further rise was encouraged on Wednesday by talk that Cominco of Canada
planned to cut production at its Trail smelter, where it produces 270,000
tonnes of zinc and 110,000 tonnes of lead annually. The company later denied
the rumours, but that did not halt the price rise. On Thursday Pasminco of
Australian announced that it planned to dispose of its European assets,
highlighting concern about the future of the 210,000 tonnes-a-year Budelco
smelter on the Belgian-Dutch border, which it owns jointly with Billiton,
the mining and metals arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. This helped to
fuel the price rise and cash metal closed yesterday at Dollars 1,185.50 a
tonne, up Dollars 21.50 on the day and Dollars 77 on the week.
A lethargic precious metals market was enlivened in mid-week by confusion
about a development in the manufacture of exhaust-cleaning autocatalysts,
the biggest single user of platinum. Corning, the US group, said it had
developed a catalyst, using extruded powdered ceramics, that could meet the
tough 1997 emission standards set by the Californian government.
Panic selling pushed the platinum price down by nearly Dollars 4 a troy
ounce before Corning made it clear that its invention would be used in
addition to, not instead of, platinum. The market quickly regained its
losses and finished ahead on the day.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange there was no let-up in the misery
of the robusta coffee market. With supplies continuing abundant and demand
slack the May delivery price sank to a 17-year low of Dollars 787 a tonne at
one stage, before ending the week Dollars 21 down on balance at Dollars 818
a tonne. According to a report published this week by ED &amp; F. Man, the
London trade house, coffee prices are likely to fall further before moving
higher in a few months time.
'In all sectors (of the coffee market) the sentiment seems to be that while
prices may recover during the course of the year, it is too dangerous to act
now on the assumption that there will be no short-run downward moves,' it
warned.
