  [Text] Dhaka, February 7 (XINHUA) -- China and Bangladesh 
signed a contract on the Barapukuria Coal-Mine Development 
Project on Monday [7 February], which will be the first such 
project ever built in this South Asian country. 
  Mei Haolin, deputy general manager of the China National 
Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC), and M. A. Jalil 
Khan, secretary of the Petrobangla signed the contract on behalf 
of their respective sides. 
  Present at the occasion were Chinese Ambassador to 
Bangladesh 
Zhang Xujiang and Bangladesh Minister of Power, Energy and 
Mineral Resources Khondaker Mosharraf Hossain [title as 
received]. 
  According to a Chinese official, the project is jointly 
contracted by CMC and other two Chinese companies, with an 
investment of more than 200 million U.S. dollars. The Chinese 
Government will provide a buyer's credit of almost 200 million 
U.S. dollars to the project. 
  It will be the largest overseas turn-key project ever 
contracted by the Chinese companies, the official noted. 
  The project, with an annual capacity of 1 million tons of 
coal, is scheduled to be completed in five years and aims to 
ease the bottle-necked energy supply in Bangladesh.
