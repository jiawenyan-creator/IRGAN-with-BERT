FT  09 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Nationalists defend support for
government
THE NATIONALIST parties were thrown on to the defensive at Westminster last
night after they reached an agreement with the government and unsuccessfully
opposed the other parties on the composition of the European Committee of
the regions.
Labour MPs accused the four Plaid Cymru and three Scottish Nationalist MPs
of doing a 'grubby deal' with the Tories, at the end of a day of negotiation
in which the government looked vainly for a way of averting defeat.
But the nationalist parties said they had won a better outcome for Scotland
and Wales than Labour had done.
Late last night Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, expressed astonishment at
the 'deal', which he said was 'clearly a matter of great public interest'.
Letters from Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, and Mr David Hunt, the
Welsh secretary, went to the nationalist parties yesterday afternoon, saying
that Scotland and Wales would have greater representation on the 24-strong
UK group in the committee than warranted by their populations.
The ministers also promised that representation, to be based on shortlists
drawn up by the parties, would include the minor parties.
Mrs Margaret Ewing, of the Scottish National Party, said her party had
secured government agreement for at least six Scottish seats on the
committee, while Plaid Cymru said the government had promised that the three
or four Welsh members of the committee would reflect the strength of the
main political parties in Wales.
Plaid Cymru also won a pledge to set up a 'reporting back' forum which will
meet in Wales and include representatives of Welsh councils, Welsh MPs and
MEPs and the Welsh representatives on the committee.
Mr Smith later called for the publication of the correspondence between
ministers and the nationalist parties.
