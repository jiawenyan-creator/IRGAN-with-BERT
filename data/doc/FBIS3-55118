  [Text] "The Union in Support of Crimea's Republic" (USCR), 
one of Crimea's most popular parties, has urged setting up an 
anti-government opposition bloc. 
  As senior party member Vladimir Zubarev, chairman of the 
Crimean Bar of Lawyers, told INTERFAX, "because of the tragic 
death of the Union's chairman, Jacob Apter, a member of 
Ukraine's Parliament, the party has been unable to nominate its 
candidate to the Crimean presidency and, for this reason, will 
support the nomination of Ivan Ermakov, the Ukrainian 
president's envoy to Sevastopol, advocating the integration of 
Sevastopol and Crimea in a single state structure. 
  Zubarev made it clear that "the USCR is ready to take part 
in 
forming a popular coalition government." In his words, "an 
economic council with Russian economists taking part in it has 
been set up for that." 
  He reported that the political council had decided to 
"constructively oppose the current Crimean Supreme Soviet 
Chairman Nikolay Batrov, nominated to the presidency despite his 
personal responsibility for the plight in the republic."
