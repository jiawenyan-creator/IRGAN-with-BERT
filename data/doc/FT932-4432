FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Due diligence led to Clydesdale
postponement
THE FINAL profits figures which led to the last-minute postponement of the
flotation of the Clydesdale electrical goods retailer were arrived at last
month after Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Clydesdale's auditors, carried out their
annual audit and the due diligence for the flotation prospectus.
Mr Jim Boyd, Clydesdale's finance director, said that Clydesdale had
suffered from reduced margins in a price war between electrical retailing
groups in the first quarter of 1993.
'On cold analysis the figures were not rich enough to float the company on a
rating that our shareholders deserved.'
Mr Boyd acknowledged that the pre-flotation audit 'does lead to scrutiny of
(a company's) accounting practices.' But Clydesdale's accounting practices
on valuing its stock and on write-offs on the cost of opening new stores
were 'clear'.
He said NatWest Securities' operating profits forecast ought to have been
about Pounds 6.5m to make it comparable with the previous year.
The forecast had included about Pounds 450,000 of interest received from
Clydesdale's insurance subsidiary, and that interest payable should have
been reduced by the same amount.
He said Clydesdale would almost certainly have to wait until next year for
another attempt at flotation. It would want to include the busy Christmas
trading period.
The flotation would have raised Pounds 30m.
