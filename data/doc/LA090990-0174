HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ROUNDUP; 
CALABASAS WITHERS UNDER BISHOP DIEGO'S PASSING ATTACK, 30-13 
Junior quarterback Richie Donati threw three scoring passes to wide receiver 
Ricky Demarest, leading Bishop Diego High to a 30-13 nonleague victory over 
Calabasas at Santa Barbara on Saturday night in the opener for both teams. 
Bishop Diego, which won only one game last season, went to the air early and 
often, scoring on its first possession on a 10-yard pass from Donati to flanker 
Benito Rivera. 
Calabasas put together an impressive 11-play, 78-yard scoring drive, capped by 
Ron Adelman's seven-yard pass to tight end Cameron LaBrache to tie the score, 
7-7, early in the second quarter. 
Then the Donati-to-Demarest connection began to click. 
Donati threw scoring strikes of 21 and 34 yards to Demarest in the second 
quarter. A 10-yard touchdown strike in the third quarter capped the Cardinal 
scoring. 
Donati also kicked a 29-yard field goal for Bishop Diego. 
Calabasas mounted a 70-yard drive late in the third quarter, with running back 
Dave Christiansen scoring on a six-yard run over right tackle. 
Donati completed nine of 19 passes for 167 yards and four touchdowns. 
Christiansen gained 73 yards in 15 carries and Adelman completed seven of 13 
passes for 84 yards for the Coyotes. PAUL OLSON
