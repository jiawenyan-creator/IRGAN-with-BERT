FT  26 FEB 92 / Letter: Not swag, but highly motivating
Sir, So far I have seen no one challenge the thought that the defendants in
the Blue Arrow and Guinness trials were not 'in it' for personal gain, and
therefore should be treated somehow differently from fraudsters who directly
steal the clients' money. I am sure I cannot be alone in taking exception to
this. What are bonuses, profit-related pay, commissions, promotions and
capital gains (not to mention a Lord of the Universe reputation) if not
'personal gain'? Not so crude as bags of swag, no doubt, but highly
motivating all the same.
