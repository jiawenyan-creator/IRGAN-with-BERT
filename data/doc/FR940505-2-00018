<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

MTMC is proposing use of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) as the method for carriers to submit international personal
property shipment rates. This system is the method by which international personal property shipment rates will
be submitted for Department of Defense (DOD)-sponsored international household goods (HHG) and unaccompanied
baggage (UB) shipments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

MTMC's intention to institute an EDI program for acquisition of carrier rates is in furtherance of the following policy
and directives:


a. Office of the Secretary of Defense Policy Memorandum directing use of American National Standards Institute EDI
standards, dated May 1988.
b. 41 Code of Federal Regulations, 10141.007, permitting use of EDI to document and pay transportation
bills, April 1989.
c. Defense Management Review Decision 941 directing use of EDI standards, dated November 1993.
MTMC proposes the use of EDI to receive, return, file, and use rates submitted by HHG and UB carriers.


The meetings listed below were held to discuss use of EDI for billing and rate filing purposes. The carrier industry
was invited to attend these meetings and was briefed on MTMC's desire to convert from a magnetic tape media for rate
submissions to an EDI process.

a. DOD/Industry EDI Personal Property Working Group meetings on June 14, 1991, and January 2931, 1992, at Bethesda,
Maryland.

b. DOD/Industry EDI Personal Property Working Group meeting on March 2325, 1992, at Indianapolis, Indiana.

Under this proposed change, carriers will be able to electronically file their rates on a daily basis during filing
windows, and will be electronically notified by the next business day of the results, i.e., total rates received and
rates rejected with a rejection error code. For the initial filing (I/F) window, carriers will have a 3-week period,
prior to the I/F deadline, in which they can add, delete, or change rates on a daily basis. Upon completion of the I/F
window, MTMC will notify all interested parties via an electronic bulletin board of all rate levels filed by traffic
channel, including which carrier established the rate. If two or more carriers establish this rate level, each carrier
will be shown. MTMC will continue to verify all carriers filing rates in the I/F window have a letter of intent on file
at each applicable installation. There will be approximately a 3-week period after notification of established
low rates and the me-too (M/T) window to allow carriers an opportunity to determine their M/T rates. Carriers will
have a 2-week period, prior to the M/T filing deadline, in which they can either add or change M/T rates on a daily basis.
However, once both I/F and M/T filing deadlines have passed, no further modifications to those rates or other rates
will be allowed. The mistake-in-rate filing (MMIRF) process will be included in the window period. The input rates
will be edited for suspect rates and returned to the carriers so they may make ``MIRF-like'' changes. There will be
two cancellation periods during each 6-month cycle in which carriers will be allowed to cancel rates.

The purpose of this proposed change is to convert the rate filing process from a magnetic tape media to electronic submission.
Initially, MTMC will accept electronic mail capabilities or in the public standard format of ANSI X.12 Transportation
Services Tender Transaction Set 602 using EDI technology. However, MTMC plans to transition over the next 18 months
to ANSI X.12 602 public standard format as the sole method for submission of international personal property rates.

It is anticipated that many automated data processing (ADP) firms currently filing magnetic tape on behalf of carriers
will continue to provide rate filing services under the electronic submission requirement. Carriers that elect
to use the services of these ADP firms will only have to notify MTMC, in writing, of the firm representing them.

For interested parties who wish to file rates using EDI procedures, the first step will be to obtain the services of
a Value Added Network (VAN) for either X.25 protocol for the EDI 602 format or X.400 protocol for the electronic mail
proprietary format. The VAN will be the conduit for exchanging rate submissions with MTMC. The next step will be to
complete a Trading Partner Agreement and submit to MTMC. A Trading Partner Agreement provides the terms and conditions
governing the exchange of administrative information between carriers and MTMC, and legally binds both parties
to those terms. The final step will be to complete three successful transmissions of rates without a communications
or technical error.

All international personal property rates will be filed via electronic submission for the International Winter
1995 (IS95) cycle, rates effective October 1, 1995. It is anticipated that the I/F window will be in May 1995 for a 3-week
period. Magnetic tapes will no longer be accepted.

DOD-approved international personal property carriers and current ADP rate tape filers will be provided instructions
on filing electronic rate submissions after comments received as a result of this 

Federal Register

 notice have been reviewed. Instructions for filing rates electronically will also be provided on the ATT Bulletin
Board. The instructions for filing electronic international personal property rates will include procedures for
filing a Trading Partner Agreement, and procedures for testing transmission of rates, along with MTMC points of contact
for these procedures.
