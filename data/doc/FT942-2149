FT  21 JUN 94 / Finance groups warned on brands
Finance companies which mislead the public by taking the name of an
unrelated dealer or manufacturer could lose their consumer credit licences,
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, warned yesterday.
He has asked trade associations for their views on proposals that companies
whose name or trading style misled customers should have their licences
suspended, revoked or varied.
He also proposes not to issue new licences to such companies or to vary
existing licences to add names which could be misleading.
Sir Bryan said the recent probe into photocopier selling practices and the
office equipment leasing industry had revealed widespread use of misleading
names by the subsidiaries of finance companies.
'These subsidiaries effectively take over the reputation of the trading
company for which they are named,' he said.
