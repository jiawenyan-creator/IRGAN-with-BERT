FT  03 DEC 93 / World Trade News: P&amp;O buys stake in Chinese terminal
P&amp;O, the UK shipping and construction group, is extending its container
terminal interests in China with the acquisition of a stake in the
Zhangjiagang-Win terminal near Shanghai, writes Charles Batchelor.
P&amp;O is to pay an undisclosed sum for a controlling interest in Win Hanverky
Investments, which owns a 51 per cent stake in the Zhangjiagang-Win
Container Terminals Company. The terminal has an annual capacity of 150,000
20-foot containers. There are plans to expand capacity to more than 350,000
containers.
P&amp;O and Swire Pacific, the Hong Kong property and aviation group, last month
paid Pounds 54m for a 25 per cent share each in Shekou Container Port.
