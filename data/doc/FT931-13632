FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: GWR AGM evicts Pena representative
THE GENERALLY soft-spoken Mr Howard Wolf finally lost his temper yesterday.
In tones aimed at deafening any objection, the chairman of USM-quoted Great
Western Resources ordered the elegant young woman from his sight.
'You are out of here]' he thundered. 'I am telling you, you are not going to
run these proceedings.'
Mr Wolf, a mild mannered Texan lawyer, might be forgiven for losing control
at Great Western's annual meeting. The lady in question represented
interests of Mr Dan Pena, who has unceasingly plagued Mr Wolf since he took
over chairmanship of GWR in 1991.
Mr Pena, the previous chairman, who still retains 10m shares, is suing the
company for alleged wrongful dismissal. He said yesterday that he would
lodge a complaint with the Stock Exchange over the eviction of his
representative.
No doubt she had hoped to raise questions concerning a statement by GWR this
week on directors' share transactions.
In it, GWR apologised for omitting to notify investors that a verbal
agreement by Mr Gary Loveless, chief executive, to buy 1m shares had been
aborted.
'It could be argued that it wasn't a wise thing for a director to do,' said
one shareholder, 'but the statement was fairly detailed.'
Mr Wolf also told the brief meeting that 1993 was a year of transition. GWR,
which last year resolved its drawn-out dispute with a US public utility and
renegotiated bank facilities, could look forward to significant benefits
from the resurrected coal and oil and gas businesses.
