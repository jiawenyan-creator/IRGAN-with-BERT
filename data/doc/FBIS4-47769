  [Text] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva reacted this afternoon 
to the latest results of the South African elections. He told 
journalists that despite the uncertainties, all the signs are 
that it will be possible for everyone to coexist in South Africa. 
  [Begin Cavaco Silva recording] Although there are 
uncertainties, and they are clear now, it seems to us that the 
electoral results, as they are known, point to a coexistence in 
South Africa, where I hope the Portuguese will have a place, and 
a place befitting their value, in continuing to contribute to 
the progress and development of South Africa. [end recording]
