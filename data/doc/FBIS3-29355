  [Text] An International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] source 
revealed that the IAEA will not inspect fuel rods at the 
experimental atomic reactor during nuclear inspections in North 
Korea this weekend. This source explained that this is because 
the inspection of the fuel rods is only possible when fuel rods 
are changed. This source also added that the IAEA inspection 
team will only inspect the monitoring camera and the sealing of 
the atomic reactor.
