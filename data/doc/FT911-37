FT  14 MAY 91 / US economic hopes rise as output level stabilises
US INDUSTRIAL production stabilised in April after six months of decline,
bolstering hopes that the recession may be bottoming out.
A rise of 0.1 per cent in industrial output, while no more than a tentative
pointer, follows other mildly encouraging statistics, including a slower
rate of decline in employment, an increase in the index of leading
indicators and the start of a housing recovery.
The better figures for April, however, were accompanied by revisions to
previous statistics. The Federal Reserve said production fell 0.6 per cent
in March - twice as much as initially estimated. In the first quarter,
industrial production fell at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 9.6 per
cent.
The tiny increase in output last month does not signal that the US recession
is over but it suggests that the rate of decline has eased significantly.
Most forecasters expect the US economy to hit bottom sometime during the
summer and then to begin a weak recovery.
Last month's improvement was led by car and truck production, which
increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 10.8 per cent. This sector
was the biggest depressing influence on the economy in the previous six
months.
Excluding motor vehicles, industrial production fell 0.2 per cent last
month. The weakness was concentrated in non-durable goods, mining and
utilities. Capacity utilisation fell 0.2 points to 78.3 per cent.
The firming of production mostly reflected increases in the output of
durable consumer goods generally, which rose at an annual rate of 3 per
cent. Apart from motor vehicles, sectors sensitive to the cost of money  -
such as furniture, carpeting and home appliances - registered increases.
The industrial production index last month stood at 105.1 compared with 100
in 1987. It was 3.4 per cent below the level of a year ago and about 5 per
cent below the peak hit last September.
