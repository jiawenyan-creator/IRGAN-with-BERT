FT  17 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel
TML's confirmation that it will consider Eurotunnel shares as part of a
claims settlement suggests this idea may well feature in any final deal. The
trouble is that the UK members of the Anglo-French building consortium
desperately want cash. Eurotunnel shareholders must hope that Sir Alastair
Morton can persuade them not to dump any new holdings in the market, given
the effect this would have on the already fragile share price.
