HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ROUNDUP 
Loyola 49, St. Francis 0 -- Loyola overwhelmed St. Francis on both sides of the 
ball and rolled to the top of the Del Rey League standings with a lopsided win 
at Glendale High. 
Tailback Kahlil McAlpin scored four touchdowns in 11 carries and finished with 
101 rushing yards. 
McAlpin got the first two Loyola touchdowns on runs of four and 10 yards, added 
a six-yard scoring jaunt in the second quarter, then finished his night with a 
40-yard scoring run 1:37 into the third quarter. 
Loyola's defense held St. Francis to 25 yards in total offense as quarterback 
John Willis completed three of 12 passes for 18 yards and the Golden Knights' 
ground game netted just seven yards in 24 carries. MIKE BARTLETT
