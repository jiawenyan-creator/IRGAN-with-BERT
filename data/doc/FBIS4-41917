  [Text] Kiev June 29 TASS -- The Ukrainian parliament 
endorsed amendments "To the Ukrainian law on local bodies of 
power and local government" on Tuesday by 216 votes. The law 
was recently turned down by the Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk and returned to the Ukrainian parliament for amendment. 
  Lawmakers approved amendments to three key articles of the 
law. Now, the law bans deputies of local councils from 
membership in executive committees of corresponding councils. 
The law says that the activities of a local council may be 
suspended only by the Ukrainian parliament on a request from the 
president, the Cabinet of Ministers or a superior corresponding 
council. Thus, the law prevents people's deputies from local 
councils to concurrently occupy several posts in local bodies of 
power, while bodies of local government can be disbanded in case 
of the violation of the legislation.
