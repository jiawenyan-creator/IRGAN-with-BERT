THE WORLD 
Sudan's State Council, the African nation's collective presidency, formally 
accepted the week-old resignation of Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's Cabinet, 
paving the way for a new government. Mahdi, bowing to pressure from military 
and labor union leaders who three weeks ago gave him an ultimatum to end the 
six-year civil war in the south, said he will name a new government as soon as 
possible. The main issue is whether the militant National Islamic Front, which 
wants a military solution to the war, will figure in a new administration. 
Mahdi has accepted a U.N. proposal for a month's truce, but the rebel 
leadership in the south has not made a decision.
