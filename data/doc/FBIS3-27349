  [Text] A sample survey conducted recently by the Fujian 
Rural Investigation Center revealed: The per capita net income 
of peasants in the province's 69 counties, cities, and districts 
rose by a large margin in 1993. For instance, per capita net 
income of peasants in the province's 10 cities and counties -- 
including the suburbs of Fuzhou, as well as Jinjiang County, 
Shishi City, Nanan County, Dongshan County, Fuqing County, Fuan 
City, Huian County, Putian City, and so on -- increased by more 
than 300 yuan in 1993. The per capita net income of peasants in 
the province's four prefectures, cities, and districts -- 
including the suburbs of Fuzhou, as well as Jinjiang County, 
Shishi City, and the suburbs of Xiamen -- now has exceeded 2,000 
yuan.
