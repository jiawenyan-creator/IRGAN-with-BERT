FT  25 JAN 92 / EC unemployment climbing
THE European Community unemployment rate rose more sharply last year than in
any year since Brussels started compiling comparative figures in 1983, but
inflation is now at its lowest rate for three years.
A report published yesterday by Eurostat, the EC's statistical office,
singled out Britain as the country with the fastest growing unemployment
rate in the Community.
Jobless Britons made up 10.2 per cent of the working population, seasonally
adjusted, in November, against 7.4 per cent in the previous year.
At the same time, the report pointed out that Ireland, where 18 per cent of
the workforce is now out of work, had overtaken Spain as the country with
the highest unemployment rate in the Community. Spain's rate appears to be
static at about 16 per cent.
The seasonally adjusted EC unemployment rate - which excludes the old East
German lander - rose steadily over the 12 months from November 1990, from
8.4 to 9.3 per cent. The number of people registered at employment offices
across the Community jumped from 14.1m in November 1990 to 15.3m last
October, more than 8 per cent.
A separate report on prices paints a more optimistic picture of the
Community's economy, with annual EC inflation down from 5.7 per cent in 1990
to 4.8 per cent last year. That is still higher than Japan (2.5 per cent)
and the US (3.1 per cent), both of which have cut inflation since 1990, but
it is the lowest EC figure since 1988, when it was 4.4 per cent.
