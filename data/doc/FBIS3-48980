  [Text] In Mostar today passed off relatively peacefully, 
though the political administration of the defense ministry of 
the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, in a special statement this 
evening, notes an irrational act by NATO planes which at 2055 on 
31 December fired at least two short bursts in the direction of 
a Croatian Defense Council [HVO] helicopter, which was flying to 
Nova Bila with the aim of evacuating the wounded from the 
Franciscan hospital. 
  The helicopter was forced to return to base despite the fact 
that advance notice of its flight had been given to the UN 
Protection Force. The act is incomprehensible, the statement 
says, because the Croatian side has made it clear that it would 
support all humanitarian actions -- something which it recently 
confirmed in practice when it allowed a Muslim aid convoy to 
pass through territory controlled by the HVO.
