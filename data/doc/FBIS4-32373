  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 23/6/1994 -- Adrian Nastase, the 
speaker of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania's Parliament had 
an interview Wednesday, 22 June, with Babken Ararktsyan, 
chairman of the Supreme Council of Armenia, head of a 
parliamentary delegation representing Armenia at the third 
plenary session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea 
Economic Cooperation Zone. 
  During the talks expressed were the two sides' hopes and 
wishes to boost ties between the two countries. Mentioned in 
the context was the stimulative factor for boosting bilateral 
ties represented by the ethnic Armenian community in Romania. 
  Also appreciated was the friendly character of ties between 
Romania and Armenia, stress being laid on the centuries-old 
cultural and spiritual traditions. Emphasized was the 
significant role played by the two parliaments for a better

parliamentary groups of friendship and to arrange swaps of 
parliamentary delegations for the ensuing period.

become mutual sources of inspiration in their efforts to solve 
political, economic, and social issues in a period of transition 
crossed by Romania and by Armenia as well.
