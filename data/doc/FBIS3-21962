  [Text] On the weekend about 1.5 kg of heroin from Turkey 
with a black-market value of at least 1.5 million schillings was 
discovered in a highway pull-in in Ansfelden near Linz. After 
weeks of investigations, criminal police officials took action 
during the planned handing over of the drugs and arrested five 
dealers. The arrested persons are two men from Wels aged 26 and 
29 respectively, one Slovene (38), one Macedonian (28), and a 
30-year-old woman from the vicinity of Wels. The Slovene and 
the Macedonian had bought the drugs in the FRY. 
  On 8 March Manfred E. and Alfredo J., both from Vienna, 
arrived at Vienna's western railroad station shortly after 1100, 
having come on the "Danube Waltz" train from Amsterdam. In 
their luggage they carried 2.5 kg of hashish and 700 grams of 
marijuana at a total market value of about 300,000 schillings. 
The two men were arrested by a reception committee of the 
Vienna criminal police and taken to the prison in Vienna's 
Provincial Court, the police announced. 
  E., 39, from Vienna's eighth district and photographer J., 
32, from Vienna's fifth district, who works for a weekly, went 
to the Dutch city on 5 March, where they rented a room in the 
"Citadel" hotel. According to information released by the 
police, an Arab, who has not yet been identified, supplied them 
with the drugs there. Then the two returned to the Austrian 
capital in the couchette car of the "Danube Waltz" train on 7 
March. The two smugglers hid the drugs in the train's toilet.
