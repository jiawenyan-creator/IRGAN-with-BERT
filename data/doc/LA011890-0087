3 AMERICANS HELD IN PLANE MANUAL TIFF 
Lockheed Aircraft Corp. said it is negotiating with the government for the 
release of three aircraft technicians detained for nearly two weeks. The three 
Americans had completed a year of training Chadians to service a Lockheed C-130 
transport plane bought by Chad. They then packed up and destroyed some 
documents, including manuals for the plane, that Chadian officials thought 
belonged to Chad.
