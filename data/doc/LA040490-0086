BRIEFLY 
Digital Unveils Workstation Family: Digital Equipment Corp. introduced its new 
DECstation 5000, Model 200 desktop workstation and other products at a news 
conference in Palo Alto. However, DEC's latest entry does not match the speed 
of the aggressive line of RS/6000 workstations unveiled Feb. 16 by IBM. DEC 
executives downplayed the speed capabilities of the new workstation while 
promoting its memory, graphics capabilities and other features.
