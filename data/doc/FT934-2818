FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Andrews Sykes shares tumble after Pounds
2.3m loss
Despite last September's warning of a significant fall in interim results,
shares in Andrews Sykes yesterday dropped 14p to 68p, after the specialist
industrial services group reported a 70 per cent decline in operating
profits to Pounds 539,000 and a pre-tax loss of over Pounds 2m.
The Pounds 2.34m deficit for the six months to September 30, which compared
with a Pounds 802,000 profit last time, partly reflected a Pounds 1.8m
charge for goodwill previously written off but now transferred under FRS 3
to the profit and loss account.
In addition, there was a Pounds 235,000 debit in respect of the closure of
the 51 per cent-owned Swedish subsidiary and the sale of Centahire, the
small tool hire business based in the north-east of England.
As foreshadowed in September, the interim dividend is omitted (1.4p). Losses
per share came out at 17.9p (0.3p earnings) or 1.9p (1.5p earnings) adjusted
for disposal and closure losses, redundancy costs and ACT written off.
At the time of the profit warning, the company announced that Mr Peter
Webber, chief executive, was stepping down to be replaced by Mr David Martin
from James Neill Holdings.
Yesterday Mr David Hubbard, chairman, said results reflected the
difficulties experienced in the summer when, although pump revenues were
maintained at last year's levels, reduced demand in the air conditioning and
heating markets severely hit profits.
Turnover dropped from Pounds 27.7m to Pounds 25.1m.
