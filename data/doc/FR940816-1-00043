 

Note also that failure to meet RFP, if not expeditiously corrected, could also result in the application of sanctions
as described in sections 110(m) and 179(b) of the amended Act (pursuant to a finding under section 179(a)(4)). 


IX. Other Requirements 


A. Executive Order 12866 


Under Executive Order 12866 (E.O. 12866) (58 FR 51,735 (October 4, 1993)), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory
action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements
of E.O. 12866. The E.O. 12866 defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that
may: 
1. Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal
government or communities; 
2. create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
3. materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
4. raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of E.O. 12866, OMB has notified EPA that this action is a ``significant regulatory action'' within
the meaning of the Executive Order. For this reason, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response
to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record. 


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Whenever the Agency is required by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) or any other law to publish
general notice of proposed rulemaking for any proposed rule, the Agency shall propose and make available for public
comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis. The regulatory flexibility requirements do not apply for this
PM10 serious area addendum to the General Preamble because it is not a regulatory action in the context of the
APA or the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
