FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): Savings Rates
IN THEORY, investors in variable-rate deposit accounts linked to the UK
money market stand to come out of the crisis worst.
Sterling is weaker, and the market is already assuming that a base rate cut
is to come. If base rates fall, interest rates for savers are bound to drop.
Savers cannot expect any preferential treatment either - the housing market
is in such difficulties, with arrears and repossessions mounting, that the
priority of banks and building societies will be to help borrowers first.
However, Anna Bowes, of Chase De Vere's Money Line, said no cuts to savings
rates had been made by the end of the week as the institutions waited for
the French vote.
For a minimum deposit of Pounds 250 it is still possible to earn 10 per cent
gross from Scarborough building society's instant access account - not far
short of three times the rate of inflation.
A gross rate as high as 11.75 per cent is available to those who put Pounds
10,000 or more into a Chelsea building society 30-day account.
Tessa rates have tended to be higher than those on normal accounts, with
some still over 12 per cent.
