MANY FIRMS HAVE BOOSTED FEBRUARY MAGAZINE AD BUDGETS TO CASH IN ON BLACK 
HISTORY 
This month -- weeks after most magazines have shrunk to normal size following 
the end of the heavy Christmas advertising season -- many black-oriented 
publications such as Ebony, Essence and Black Enterprise are fat with ads, 
thanks to the designation of February as Black History Month. 
In an effort to garner good will from the nation's black consumers who spend an 
estimated $240 billion annually, many of the country's biggest advertisers -- 
including Anheuser-Busch Inc., AT&amp;T, Burger King, Miller Brewing Co., 
Eastern Airlines, McDonalds and Coca-Cola -- have taken out full-page ads in 
black magazines and newspapers touting the achievements of black historical 
figures and celebrating black history month. 
"The February issues of most magazines tend to be thin issues after the heavy 
spending from September through December," explained Clarence O. Smith, 
president of Essence Communications Inc., publisher of the black women's 
magazine Essence. "If it were not for Black History Month, we, as well as other 
black publications, would do a lot less well in February." 
The February issue of Ebony contains at least 10% more advertising than the 
December issue and is the largest behind the special August issue of Ebony, 
said Dennis Boston, vice president of advertising. The February Black 
Enterprise, with 244 pages, was more than twice the size of the 100-page 
December issue. 
Although the special advertising efforts have boosted the economic fortunes of 
many black advertising agencies and black publications, some black historians 
complain that the educational value of the campaigns may be suspect. 
"The possibility exists for exploitation . . . because these companies are 
engaged in business to make money," said Karen A. Robinson, executive director 
of the Assn. for the Study of Afro-American Life and History, a 
Washington-based group that founded Black History Month. "They are not 
historians. I think a better way for Black History Month to be celebrated would 
be for corporations to work with organizations like ours that have some 
expertise in the field." 
Black historical achievement has been publicly recognized each year since at 
least 1926, when historian Carter G. Woodson started Negro History Week. But 
corporations did not embrace the observance as a marketing tool until they 
began hiring black advertising agencies in the 1970s, said Ken Smikle, editor 
and publisher of Target Market News, a Chicago-based trade publication that 
follows the black consumer market. 
Awards, Scholarships 
The trend gained momentum in 1986, Smikle said, with the designation of Martin 
Luther King Jr.'s birthday as a federal holiday. As a result, he said, more and 
more of the $700 million advertisers spend annually to reach black consumers -- 
out of the $24 billion in total ad spending -- is showered on black 
publications between January and February. 
In addition, companies such as Miller, McDonalds and Coca-Cola spend millions 
more in promotions and sponsorships aimed at black consumers. 
Coke, for example, will award more than $130,000 in college scholarships 
through Coca-Cola's "Share the Dream" scholarship sweepstakes that run in 
conjunction with Black History Month, said Charles Morrison, vice president of 
black and Hispanic consumer markets. 
While the advertisers emphasize that they market to black consumers throughout 
the year, they say they make special efforts during February in order to 
maintain awareness of their products as well as enhance their reputations as 
being sensitive to the black community. 
"These ads are not intended to sell products," said Ivan Burwell, Coors 
national program manager. "I simply see it as a recognition by Coors of the 
importance of the black consumer market. It certainly is an honest and sincere 
effort to recognize black achievement." 
However, historians complain that many ads avoid controversial political 
figures in black history. 
Although at least two recent ads mention Black Muslim Malcolm X, most highlight 
inventors or pre-colonization African royalty. An AT&amp;T advertisement 
depicts inventor Lewis Latimer, for example. Similarly, an Eastern Airlines ad 
features African kings. 
Historian John Henrike Clarke, a professor emeritus of African History at 
Hunter College in New York who has written or edited 25 books on black history 
and served as a historical consultant to companies that do Black History Month 
advertising, says that while some of the ads expose Americans to information 
they might not otherwise be aware of, some of the efforts at black history are 
"superficial." 
"In general, these are not benevolent efforts; they are mostly public 
relations," Clarke said. "I'm not saying they are evil in any way. Its just 
that they have their own self-interest, which is to sell more of their products 
and services. As a result, they cite the safe historical figures. They don't 
cite . . . ones like Marcus Garvey because they don't want to cause trouble." 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
Begun in 1926 as "Negro History Week" by historian Carter G. Woodson, Black 
History Month attempts to spotlight the influence of blacks on history. The 
seven-day tribute was expanded to all of February in 1976. 
The observance is sponsored by the Assn. for the Study of Afro-American Life 
and History, a Washington-based group of about 200 historians founded by 
Woodson. 
The theme for this year's observance is "The Role of Afro-American Churches in 
Economic, Political and Social Development at Home and Abroad."
