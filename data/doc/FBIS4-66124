Palermo"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Palermo, May 19 -- A Peugeot 205 belonging 
to a former Left Democrat mayor and now public works councillor 
at San Cipirello, about 30 km from Palermo, was found burned-out 
outside his home this morning in what police think is the latest 
in a string of intimidatory attacks in the Palermo area against 
left-wing politicians elected in December. 
  Giuseppe Italiano, who attended yesterday's local meeting 
with Interior Minister Roberto Maroni to offer a visible 
response to the wave of bombings, said "I have no shady dealings 
of any sort; I'm sure the burning of my car fits into the Mafia 
strategy of intimidating the new left-wing councils. I've 
always been in the front line in local initiatives against the 
Mafia." 
  Antonino Inzerillo, mayor of nearby San Giuseppe Jato, said 
the Mafia was pursuing "a well-defined political design, aimed 
at deterring the left-wing councils that represent change." 
"With this attack," Inzerillo added, "Cosa Nostra wants to show 
it is present and has not given up control of the territory." 
  The local Left Democrat office issued a communique saying 
that "the attack on Giuseppe Italiano, a banner of the farm 
labourers' movement in the province of Palermo, shows that the 
Mafia offensive aims to strike all the pillars of the 
progressive movement: councils, trade unions, the cooperative 
movement, and the very tradition of the popular struggle in the 
province of Palermo." It said the campaign resembled "that of 
1947-'48, when the Mafia and the bandit Salvatore Giuliano tried 
to crush the popular peasants' and workers' movement in defence 
of the interests of the dominant classes. They did not succeed 
then, and they shall not succeed now," it went on, expressing 
appreciation for Minister Maroni's visit but calling on the 
Berlusconi government to move from pledges to action and "start 
getting seriously to grips" with the Mafia problem. [passage
