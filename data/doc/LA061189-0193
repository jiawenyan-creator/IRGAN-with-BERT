ACCUSATIONS AND BIAS 
Gail Buckley complains that "(Steven) Corbin's three black male characters are 
lamentable in the extreme. Two are more or less homosexual. . . ." This 
shockingly homo-phobic statement is an example of a biased and ignorant kind of 
thinking that is itself much more "lamentable in the extreme" than the sexual 
orientation of any person, whether fictional or not.
