ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: IRVINE; 
SANTA ANA, LAGUNA FREEWAYS LINK TO CLOSE 
Caltrans' forecast for Monday traffic out on the Santa Ana Freeway in Irvine: 
Bad to worse, with apologies. 
The northbound Santa Ana Freeway connector to the southbound Laguna Freeway in 
Irvine will be permanently closed by Caltrans at 7 a.m. Monday for bridge work. 
State Department of Transportation engineer Hillary McMahon said the closure is 
necessary in order to widen the freeway from three regular, mixed-flow lanes at 
that location to four such lanes plus a car-pool lane on the northbound side of 
the freeway. 
Caltrans has suggested using the Alton Parkway exit from the Santa Ana Freeway 
and Sand Canyon Avenue to leave the San Diego Freeway. 
"Caltrans regrets any inconvenience this might present," the agency said 
Friday. But the work under way is intended to "increase efficiency and better 
accommodate traffic volume."
