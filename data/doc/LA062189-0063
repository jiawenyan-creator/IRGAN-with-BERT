THE STATE 
A California Highway Patrol officer in Los Banos has been fired for allegedly 
lying about her association with another officer who is charged with murdering 
his wife, authorities said. Laura Farmer, 27, was fired May 30 for "unbecoming 
conduct" and lying under oath during her testimony at a preliminary hearing for 
Robert Emmert. CHP Lt. Cal Minor said Farmer lied when she testified that she 
did not spend time alone with Emmert at another officer's house when the two 
were supposed to be on duty. Her testimony was contradicted by another officer 
who testified that Farmer and Emmert met on two occasions at her home while 
they were on duty and spent time alone together in a bedroom. Prosecutors 
allege that he murdered his wife last August to keep her from testifying 
against him on a spousal abuse charge.
