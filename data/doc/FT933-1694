FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Fiat buys out Ford stake in New
Holland
FIAT of Italy has taken over Ford's remaining 6.5 per cent stake in its New
Holland tractors and construction equipment business.
The US group sold its Ford New Holland tractor and industrial equipment
operations to Fiat in 1991, but retained a 20 per cent stake.
The holding was reduced to 13 per cent by an injection of new equity capital
by Fiat into the loss-making business, and Ford requested a further cut to
6.5 per cent in May this year.
Ford has now agreed to withdraw completely from New Holland, although Fiat
can still use the Ford oval trademark until May 1995 and the Ford name until
2001 on certain of its products.
Two Ford executives, Mr Allan Gilmour and Mr Peter Pestillo, have resigned
from the New Holland board.
