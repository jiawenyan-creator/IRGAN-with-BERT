FT  11 MAR 93 / Reno likely to be confirmed as attorney-general
MRS JANET RENO, a 54-year-old Miami prosecutor, is sailing swiftly through
the US Senate for what is likely to be an early confirmation as
attorney-general. She appeared before the Senate judiciary committee
yesterday for more questioning, after which its members voted unanimously to
approve her nomination. The full Senate may vote on it today.
