  [Text] At a session of the Saeima foreign affairs 
commission today, Martins Virsis, the parliamentary secretary at 
the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the head of the 
Latvian delegation for talks with Russia, viewed the blowing up 
of a high-tension power line near Skrunda as an incident of a 
political nature, stressing its advantage to Russia. As Virsis 
said, incidents of this kind are to the benefit of Russia to 
justify to the world and especially the United States its 
military interests in Latvia. In addition, Virsis expressed 
indignation at the performance of the Latvian security service, 
which did not provide government departments with the necessary 
information immediately after the incident. 
  Power was reconnected to the damaged high-tension line after 
the completion of restoration work at 2104 yesterday.
