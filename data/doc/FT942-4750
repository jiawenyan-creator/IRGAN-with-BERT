FT  08 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: National Grid
The regional electricity companies are going to find it hard not to give the
green light for a flotation of the National Grid. Yesterday's 15 per cent
rise in the Grid's dividend seems designed to maintain the pressure. It
further highlights the value of the recs' stakes in the Grid, which could be
worth Pounds 4bn as a stand-alone entity. The recs' share prices responded
accordingly, with their combined market capitalisation rising by over Pounds
100m. But the further share prices rise in anticipation of a flotation, the
more the recs are boxed in. They presumably know that a decision not to
press ahead would leave investors disappointed and hit their share prices.
