 

b. Preferential Export Financing Under CICOPCRE 626



We verified that on May 10, 1990, the functions of CACEX of the Bank of Brazil, which administered these export financing
loans, were absorbed by the Secretariat of Foreign Trade (SECEX). SECEX was not empowered to perform banking operations
and the export financing was discontinued. See, also, Certain Round-Shaped Agricultural Tillage Tools from Brazil;
Preliminary Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review, March 31, 1992 (57 FR 10885) (Tillage Tools).



c. Reduction of Industrial Products Tax (IPI) and Import Duties Under Decreto No. 77.065 Through BEFIEX (Comissao
par a Concessao de Beneficios a Programas Especials de Exportacao) and CIEX (Comissao para Incentivos a Exportacao)



We verified that on April 12, 1990, Decree Law 8,032 limited this program exclusively to imports made by the federal,
state, and municipal governments, territories, and other political entities, and scientific institutions, thereby
eliminating the benefit to commerical enterprises. See, also, Tillage Tools.



d. Preferential Financing for National Trading Companies Under Resolution 883 of the Banco Central do Brasil



We verified that Banco Central do Brasil Resolution 1,744 revoked Resolution 883 on August 30, 1990, thereby terminating
this program. See, also, Tillage Tools.



e. Preferential Financing Under Resolution 68 Through FINEX



We verified that this program was terminated on April 5, 1988, by Article 4 of Brazil's new constitution, which provided
that all programs requiring funding from the national treasury had to be reenacted within a two-year period or cease
to exist. Legislation to reenact preferential financing through FINEX was not passed and the program ceased to exist.



f. Preferential Financing Under Resolution 579/83 Through PROEX and PROSIM



We verified that preferential financing through PROSIM was terminated on February 4, 1985, by BNDES Resolution 607,
and that preferential financing through PROEX was terminated in 1991 by BNDES Resolution 762.



g. Preferential Financing for the Storage of Merchandise Destined for Export Under Resolution 330/Portaria 130
of the Banco Central do Brasil



We verified that this program was terminated on August 21, 1984, by Central Bank Resolution 950.

We also examined the following programs and preliminarily determine that the respondents did not use them during
the review period:



a. Preferential Financing for Industrial Enterprises by the Bank of Brazil 

b. Preferential Financing Under Resolution 578/83 Through FUNPAR

c. Accelerated Depreciation for Brazilian Made Capital Goods 

d. Green Yellow Drawback (Portaria 68/83)



Preliminary Results of Review



As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine the net subsidy to be 0.03 percent, which is de minimis, for the
period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992.

If the final results of this review remain the same as these preliminary results, the Department intends to instruct
the Customs Service not to assess countervailing duties on shipments of the subject merchandise from all companies,
exported on or after January 1, 1992 and on or before December 31, 1992. Further, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of
the Act, the Department will instruct Customs not to collect cash deposits on shipments of this merchandise from all
companies entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the date of publication of the final results
of this administrative review. 

Parties to the proceeding may request disclosure of the calculation methodology and interested parties may request
a hearing not later than ten days after the date of publication of this notice. Interested parties may submit written
arguments in case briefs on these preliminary results within 30 days of the date of publication. Rebuttal briefs,
limited to agruments raised in case briefs, may be submitted seven days after the time limit for filing the case brief.
Requests for a hearing should be made within ten days of the publication of these preliminary results. Any hearing,
if requested, will be held within seven days after the scheduled date for submission of rebuttal briefs. Copies of
case briefs and rebuttal briefs must be served on interested parties in accordance with 19 CFR 355.38(e) of the Department's
regulations. The Department will publish the final results of this administrative review, including the results
of its analysis of issues raised in any case or rebuttal brief.

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 355.22.
