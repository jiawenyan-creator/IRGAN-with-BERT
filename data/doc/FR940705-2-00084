lands for Creve Coeur Lake Memorial Park, St. Louis County, Missouri. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Park Service, in compliance with section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1069
(NEPA) [42 United States Code (U.S.C.) 4321 et seq. and 42 U.S.C. 4332, as amended] and with section 6(f) of the Land
and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act (Public Law 88578, as amended), announces the availability of a draft
supplemental environmental impact statement (DSEIS) evaluating additional replacement land for the 184 acres
of Creve Coeur Lake Memorial Park converted from outdoor recreation use. Creve Coeur Lake Memorial Park is a county
park which has received Federal financial assistance from the LWCF program. This DSEIS will supplement the final
environmental impact statement (FEIS) for Page Avenue (Route D) extension, St. Louis and St. Charles Counties, Missouri,
approved in a Record of Decision on January 6, 1993, by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). 



The FHWA FEIS addressed construction of a ten-land elevated extension of Page Avenue across the southern tip of the
park site assuming all necessary coordination with other Federal agencies has been satisfactorily accomplished.
The National Park Service on December 11, 1992, adopted the FEIS for use in the environmental evaluation requirements
of section 6(f) of the LWCF Act. 

The initial proposal of 265 acres, submitted by the State of Missouri to replace the converted 184 acres was determined
by the National Park Service as not offering ``reasonably equivalent usefulness'' to the extent necessary to reflect
appropriately the loss of this unique natural area. Secretary Babbitt announced on May 18, 1993, in letters to Senators
Danforth and Bond, that he did not intend to use his authority under section 6(f)(3) to block the construction of this
highway project. He further stated that ``...it is necessary to identify a significant amount
of additional lands to be included in the mitigation package.'' 

The DSEIS identifies a range of alternative land proposals, including additional substitution properties, and
analyzes the ``equivalent usefulness'' of each candidate replacement land parcel. In addition, each of the replacement
parcels have been evaluated for impacts on natural and cultural resources, the socioeconomic environment, and current
uses. 

The State of Missouri's and the NPS's preferred alternative for additional replacement land is identified in the
DSEIS as Alternative B (Little Creve Coeur Lake Proposal). The alternative, consisting of approximately 440 acres
and located southwest of the present Creve Coeur Lake Memorial Park, consists primarily of wetlands presently in
agricultural use. 

Copies of the DSEIS may be obtained from the responsible official, Mr. William Schenk, Acting Regional Director (refer
to address below). Comments on the DSEIS should be received no later than August 8, 1994.
