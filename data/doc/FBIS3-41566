  [Text] Seoul, Nov 19 (YONHAP) -- The Working-Level 
Environment Conservation Committee approved a proposal Friday to 
expand Korea's natural ecosystem conservation area from 91 
square kilometers to 5,000 square kilometers, or 5 percent of 
the whole area of the country, by 2003. 
  Under the 10-year basic plan for environmental conservation, 
prepared by the Environment Ministry, the ministry will 
designate more than 40 percent of the virgin forest, woods and 
grassy plains in Korea ``green track of land conservation 
areas'' and more than 20 places rich in indigenous flora and 
fauna will be named ``natural ecosystem protection areas.'' 
  Under the plan, the ministry will put forth an optimum ``per 
capita ratio of urban green areas'' and will, based thereon, 
work out area-by-area master plans for the expansion of green 
areas. 
  The plan also calls for the creation of a national pavilion 
for preservation of biological resources at 40 billion won (44 
million U.S. dollars) to house about 10 million specimens, and 
to set up a biological variety research institute. 
  The plan also includes a project to study and manage the 
natural environment of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) jointly with 
North Korea.
