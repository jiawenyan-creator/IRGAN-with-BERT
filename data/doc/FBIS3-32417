  [Text] Upon conclusion of a six-day visit to Brazil, Carlos 
Lage Davila, Cuban Council of State vice president, said today 
in Rio de Janeiro that the United States is increasingly more 
isolated in its blockade against Cuba. Lage Davila has already 
left by plane for Colombia. 
  Lage said that an example of that isolation is approval for 
two consecutive years by the UN General Assembly of resolutions 
rejecting the U.S. blockade. He added that in the second year, 
the number of countries supporting the resolution for Washington 
to suspend the embargo on Vietnam has increased. He said that 
the lifting of the embargo on Vietnam is the result of the 
heroic struggle and victory of the Vietnamese people, thus 
making more evident to international public opinion the unjust 
and cruel nature of the U.S. blockade against Cuba. 
  In Brazil, Lage Davila and his delegation visited Sao Paulo, 
Brasilia, and Rio de Janeiro. They also met with President 
Itamar Franco and the ministers of foreign affairs, the economy, 
and health, in a series of activities that yielded positive 
results.
