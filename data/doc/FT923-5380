FT  01 SEP 92 / Observer: Goode thinking?
Whatever happened to Professor Roy Goode's Pension Law review committee? It
is nearly three months since the Government set up the review in the wake of
the Maxwell affair and not a peep has been heard out of it.
The committee was given 12 months to produce its report, although if the
committee felt that changes should be initiated urgently, it would produce
interim findings before publishing its formal report. At the end of June a
consultation paper was promised 'within a few weeks'. But so far nothing has
been heard of the good professor and his plans for conducting public
hearings. It is a hideously complex subject with a lot of big, vested
interests to be tackled , but it all seems to be taking a long time.
Time was when occupational pension scheme members meekly accepted what the
trustees judged fit. However, the decision of some Lucas Industries'
pensioners to sue the trustees of the company's Pounds 2bn pension fund, is
yet another example of the growing restiveness about the role of pension
fund trustees.
