  [Excerpt] President Rafael Caldera has reported that the 
suspension of economic guarantees is directed at dealing with 
the country's financial crisis. Regarding the Value Added Tax 
[VAT], Caldera said very soon the government will present to 
Congress a general tax reform bill that calls for the definite 
elimination of the VAT on consumers, substituting it with other 
collection mechanisms that will allow those who have more to pay 
more. This announcement was welcomed by the community. [passage
