'PUTTING A FILM PROTEST IN FOCUS' 
Del Olmo states that he was "at first reluctant to weigh in on the side of the 
many Latinos who are angry about a recent UCLA film." He also goes on to state 
that as long as the Latinos activists stick to the issue, he is with us. 
What a gutless wimp. This is a film that insults him and our people and he is 
worried about some moron's right of freedom of speech. Any real man when 
insulted gets fighting mad but apparently Del Olmo has to think about it. Who 
needs him. 
Thank God we had some Chicanas at UCLA who protested against the film.
