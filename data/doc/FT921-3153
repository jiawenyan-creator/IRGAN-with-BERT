FT  16 MAR 92 / Bad health to force Manley out of office
JAMAICA'S prime minister Michael Manley announced yesterday he would resign
on March 28, ending a family political dynasty that led the Caribbean island
to independence.
Mr Manley, aged 67, will be stepping down two years before the end of his
third, non-consecutive term in office. He said he was leaving because of
poor health, after five major operations in the past eight years, and that
the demands of leading the government had become too taxing.
He said delegates of the ruling People's National Party on March 28 would
select a new president who would become the prime minister. His successor is
likely to be either Mr Percival Patterson, the party chairman and a former
deputy prime minister and finance minister, or Ms Portia Simpson, the labour
and welfare minister.
Mr Manley, a social democrat whose first two terms as prime minister in the
1970s were marked by widespread state intervention in the economy, has more
recently presided over extensive deregulation of the economy of the island
of 2.5m people.
He said yesterday that the party had agreed that there would be no change in
the government's move towards a market-driven economy, and that all his
likely successors had agreed to this. 'Continuity is assured and
guaranteed,' the prime minister said.
Mr Manley's father, Norman, founded the PNP in 1938 to represent trade
unionists, and served as party leader until succeeded by his son in 1970.
The elder Manley was a charismatic and populist figure who spearheaded the
nation's independence from Britain in August 1962, seven years after he had
become prime minister.
