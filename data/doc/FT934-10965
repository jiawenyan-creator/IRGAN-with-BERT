FT  03 NOV 93 / House prices end summer increases
HOUSE PRICES ground to a halt last month after rising during the summer,
emphasising the fragile nature of the housing market recovery, Halifax,
Britain's biggest mortgage lender, announced yesterday.
It said that average prices, although they remained unchanged between
September and October, were still 1.5 per cent higher than the same time
last year.
