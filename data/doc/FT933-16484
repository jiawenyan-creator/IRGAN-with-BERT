FT  03 JUL 93 / Judge raps Patten over grammar school
APPROVAL FOR the creation of England's first new grammar school for more
than 20 years was granted by the High Court yesterday.
Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School in Penrith, Cumbria, will be allowed to
apply academic criteria when selecting pupils from September.
However, the judge, Mr Justice Tucker, reprimanded the education secretary,
Mr John Patten, for claiming in a press release that the plan had 'the clear
backing of governors and local communities', and refused to award him legal
costs.
The judge said: 'I have no doubt if this statement had been made in public
meetings in Cumbria it would have been treated as derisory.'
The plan had been strongly opposed by local councillors, the head of the
other secondary school in Penrith, and by the heads of several local primary
schools. The Department for Education admitted that it had received 70
objections to the proposal and only one letter of support. The department
said it regretted publishing the misleading press release, which the judge
described as 'a most unfortunate document'.
Cumbria county council, controlled by Labour with Liberal Democrat support,
had challenged Mr Patten's decision on the grounds that he did not take
local objections into account.
The judge, however, decided Mr Patten's decision was lawful because he had
taken local opposition into account, and so his approval was 'procedurally
flawless'.
Queen Elizabeth's opted to start using academic criteria - which will not
involve '11-plus' exams - because it is expanding to take 11-year-olds.
Previously children started at 13.
In practice very few applicants, if any, are likely to be denied admission.
The legal decision provoked condemnation from opposition politicians and
teachers' unions. Mr Don Foster, the Liberal Democrat education spokesman,
said Mr Patten had deserved his 'come-uppance'.
