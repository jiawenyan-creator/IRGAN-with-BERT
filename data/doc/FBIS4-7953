  [Text] [Announcer] The parliament's cultural committee is 
holding an emergency session. The committee chairman convened 
deputies to discuss the letter of Laszlo Csucs [Hungarian Radio 
deputy chairman] on the radio dismissals. Edit Schranz reports 
on the details: 
  [Schranz] If the cultural committee session does not lead to 
results today, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] will 
consider, in accordance with the Constitution, the convention of 
an extraordinary parliamentary session to establish the extent 
of the government's responsibility in the radio matter, Tamas 
Fodor, SZDSZ deputy in the cultural committee, told "Chronicle." 
  Tamas Fodor also said that the parliament's mandate did not 
cease today, as committee sessions could be convened at any 
time. In his view it is doubtful that the Hungarian Radio deputy 
chairman had justified his measures in his letter to the 
committee. 
  Committee Chairman Attila Zsigmond from the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum told today's dailies that he could accept some 
of the details of Laszlo Csucs's letter.
