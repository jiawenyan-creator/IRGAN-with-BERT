FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: LOT, American Airlines sign
partnership
LOT Polish Airlines yesterday signed a commercial partnership agreement with
American Airlines, the second largest US carrier, to give it greater access
to the US market. The deal is expected to lead to a long term strategic
alliance, LOT said.
The partnership will involve ticket code sharing, co-ordination of
timetables, baggage handling co-operation, and the use for LOT of American's
aircraft purchase and leasing opportunities.
The Polish airline, which has been battling with British Airways for North
Atlantic traffic from Poland to the US, has been seeking a western partner
to help it modernise and become more competitive.
