FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Australian investment group lifts stake in
Towles to 51.4%
LONDON CITY Equities, the investment group based in Sydney, Australia, has
increased its stake in Towles, the UK textiles group from 45 to 51.4 per
cent.
LCE has no seat on the board and the majority stake gives it only 13.9 per
cent of the votes.
The group said it had repeatedly sought boardroom representation but this
had been denied by shareholders of the Midlands-based group.
LCE said Towles directors owned 18.8 per cent of the equity and had 41 per
cent of the votes. Towles said the directors had a holding approaching half
of the voting ordinary shares.
At the 1990 annual meeting, a resolution to elect Mr Peter Murray, LCE
chairman, to the board was defeated.
LCE, whose market capitalisation is Pounds 2m, has been buying mainly
non-voting shares in Towles, which has a market capitalisation of less than
Pounds 5m and made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1,000 in 1991-92.
The Australian group began acquiring shares in 1987 because it thought
Towles was asset rich and cash poor. The recent purchases comprised 168,081
A ordinary shares, which carry no votes, at 90p each.
Apart from pinning his hopes on a proposed European Community directive on
non-voting shares - Mr Murray said it would guarantee one-share-one-vote -
he does not have any firm strategy for securing influence.
