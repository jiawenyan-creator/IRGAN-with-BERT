FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (8): Uncertainty and expansion - Oil and
Gas industry
INDONESIA'S oil sector is at a turning-point. A record number of contract
areas have been signed in the past three years, confirming oil companies'
interest in the archipelago.
The number of new discoveries, however, has been disappointing and Indonesia
is unlikely to postpone the date on which it becomes a net importer of oil
until after the turn of the century.
Production has averaged about 1.5m barrels per day and reserves remain
around 11bn barrels, enough to sustain production at current levels for
another 20 years. In addition, only 36 of Indonesia's 60 known oil basins
have been explored and only 14 developed.
Most new areas of exploration, however, are in complex geological structures
or are deep offshore.
Current reserves were built up during two periods of extensive exploration
in the 1940s, and again in the 1960s. The country is now undergoing a third
wave of exploration. The number of new production-sharing contracts signed
between Pertamina, the state-owned oil and gas company, and foreign oil
companies, rose from seven in 1987 to a record 22 last year.
However, the level of exploration commitment under the new contracts - over
Dollars 2.8bn within the next 10 years - is not particularly high, and oil
companies want contract incentives improved.
The government disagrees, saying the incentives are adequate. 'How else can
you explain the jump in the number of new contract areas, except that the
conditions are sufficient?' said one government official.
Foreign companies insist, however, that the terms are among the least
attractive in the world. As one executive noted: 'The number of signed
contract areas may be up, but the level of drilling is down'.
Even if exploration drilling increases, the number of sizeable deposits
remaining to be discovered is an unknown quantity, although the immediate
omens are not good. As an executive of a foreign oil company explained: 'The
last block awarded that had over 100m barrels was in 1971. No-one taking up
new acreage has had significant discoveries.'
Meanwhile, domestic fuel consumption is growing rapidly. In 1990 it rose 20
per cent to nearly 700,000 barrels a day (b/d) and the rate of increase is
expected to continue over the next decade. Government and industry officials
agree that at some point between 1997 and 2005 Indonesia will become a net
importer of oil and will have to leave the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
This will go hand in hand with a move to process more of domestic
production. The wilder fancies of Pertamina received a blow last September
when the government announced that 16 refining projects, provisionally
scheduled for construction before 1996 with a total cost of Dollars 21.5bn,
had been postponed.
A number of projects have, however, be allowed to proceed. These include the
Dollars 420m upgrading of the Musi and Balikpapan refineries and
construction of the Dollars 1.5bn Cilicap olefin plant and the Dollars 2bn
Exor-1 refinery.
The government has also given approval for a Dollars 1.6bn Chandra Asri
olefin plant to go ahead under 100 per cent foreign ownership, although how
its Indonesian backers, including the Bimantara Group run by President
Suharto's second son, will meet this condition is uncertain.
Also likely to be given approval under condition of foreign-ownership is the
Dollars 1bn Exor-3 refinery in joint partnership between BP of the UK and C
Itoh of Japan.
While the future of the oil sector is uncertain, the gas sector is likely to
expand over the next decade. Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of
liquified natural gas (LNG) with exports in 1991 estimated at 22.5m tonnes,
and also produces liquified petroleum gas (LPG), with exports of 2.6m tonnes
in 1990.
In 1990, LNG and LPG export revenue totalled Dollars 4.2bn, equivalent to
about 550,000 b/d of crude oil. Between January and October last year, LNG
exports totalled Dollars 3.1bn and LPG exports reached Dollars 287m.
Indonesia's principal buyer remains Japan, although Taiwan and South Korea
are emerging markets.
Upgrading of LNG production facilities is expected to raise capacity to from
22.6m tonnes in 1990 to 23.5m tonnes this year. A Dollars 750m contract to
construct a sixth LNG train at Bontang, East Kalimantan, has been awarded to
the Humpuss Group led by President Suharto's youngest son. Due for
completion by 1994, it will boost Indonesia's total production capacity to
27m tonnes.
The new train will supply 20-year contracts to sell 2m tonnes a year to
Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas and Toho Gas of Japan.
In total, Indonesia has long-term LNG contracts to export 24.5m tonnes from
1994. Industry officials expect further contracts to raise production to a
sustainable level of 30m tonnes a year shortly after the turn of the
century.
The one area of uncertainty is the development of the Natuna gas field
situated in the South China Sea which, with 45 tscf (trillion standard cubic
feet) of commercial gas reserves, is at the heart of the industry's future.
Esso Indonesia has a 50 per cent stake in the field, with the remaining
interest held by Pertamina. Government officials concede, however, that
Pertamina will be unable to fund its share of the Dollars 15bn required to
develop the field.
'Pertamina cannot raise the money and government officials say Pertamina may
reduce its stake in Natuna to 10 per cent. Whoever takes the 40 per cent
will be expected to carry Pertamina's financing obligations', an industry
executive close to the negotiations explained.
Companies which have shown an interest in taking a stake include Nissho
Iwai, Mitsui and Mitsubishi of Japan, and Mobil of the US.
The high capital cost of the project is accounted for by the heavy platforms
and technology needed to handle the gas which has a 70 per cent carbon
dioxide content.
Exactly how the carbon dioxide will be handled, given environmental concerns
that it should not be released into the atmosphere, has not been finalised.
A deal must be struck this year if Natuna is to come on stream by 1998, the
year when Pertamina starts to renegotiate important long-term LNG agreements
with Japan. These are currently being supplied by the Arun field off north
Sumatra, but its reserves are insufficient to guarantee new contracts.
