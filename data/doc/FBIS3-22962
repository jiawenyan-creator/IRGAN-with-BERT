  [Text] The security forces managed by sheer chance to foil 
a new attempt to assassinate President Husni Mubarak when they 
raided hideouts of the Islamic groups in al-Ma'sarah, Hulwan, 
and al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' over the past three weeks. Nine 
members of the groups were charged with the attempt and have 
been referred to the military court in criminal case No. 2 of 
1994 in Sidi Barrani, Marsa Matruh, where the attempt was to 
have taken place when President Mubarak intended to visit Libya. 
The defendants managed to plant explosive charges in two 
important places: the airport and the VIP lounge where President 
Mubarak is used to staying. 
  One of the casualties in the raid on al-Ma'sarah-Hulwan made 
detailed confessions under the influence of drugs while he was 
in surgery. Hamadah Muhammad Lutfi Abd-al-Baqi, one of the 
defendants in the attempt, was killed when the security forces 
raided the al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' hideout last week. 
  It is worth noting that the Sidi Barrani court held its 
first 
hearing on this case on 30 January. It will hold another 
hearing next week. A retired judge has been summoned to chair 
the trial. He previously passed a verdict in a military case.
