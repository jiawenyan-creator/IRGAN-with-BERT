FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard sustains growth
rate in third term
Hewlett-Packard, the pace-setter of the computer industry, maintained its
rapid growth in its third quarter with revenues up 22 per cent and a 27 per
cent rise in orders.
'We had a very good quarter, with excellent order and revenue growth and
substantial profit improvement,' said Mr Lew Platt, chairman, president and
chief executive.
'We have good momentum going into the fourth quarter,' he said. But, with
typical caution, he added that in spite of improvement in the global
economy, 'we expect the competitive environment to remain intense'.
Net earnings for the third quarter to July 31 were Dollars 347m, or Dollars
1.33 a share, up from Dollars 271m, or Dollars 1.06, in the same period last
year. Earnings per share for the third quarter of 1994 were reduced by 3
cents through the inclusion of employee stock options in the number of
outstanding shares.
Net revenue was Dollars 6.1bn, up from Dollars 5.0bn last year. Net revenue
in the US was Dollars 2.8bn, up 20 per cent, while net revenue outside the
US was Dollars 3.3bn, a 24 per cent increase over last year's third quarter.
Earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations. However, the company's
exceptionally strong growth in orders booked during the third quarter
excited investors, and HP's share price jumped Dollars 8 1/2 to close at
Dollars 87 5/8 in New York.
HP said orders booked during the third quarter totalled Dollars 6bn, an
increase of 27 per cent over the same period last year. US orders rose 24
per cent to Dollars 2.8bn while orders from outside the US increased 29 per
cent to Dollars 3.2bn.
In HP's core computer business, revenues were up 20 per cent at Dollars
4.7bn for the quarter. Orders jumped 28 per cent to Dollars 4.6bn. The
company said orders for PC and network servers were 'outstanding', with
growth substantially outpacing the market rate.
HP's flagship PC printers continued to sell strongly in the quarter and the
company said it saw an 'excellent increase in orders' for its popular
Deskjet models.
For the nine months ended July 31, net revenue increased to Dollars 18bn
from Dollars 14.6bn while net earnings grew 28 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn.
Net earnings per share were Dollars 4.31, up from Dollars 3.47 in the first
nine months of fiscal 1993.
