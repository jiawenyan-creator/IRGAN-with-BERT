  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk will be ready to sign the 
agreement on economic union between the CIS countries the day 
after Ukraine's parliament adopts its stipulations to the 
agreement. Addressing the leaders of collective and state farms 
of Kharkov Region on Monday [6 June], Kravchuk said that he had 
no right to sign the agreement, since the parliament had not 
authorized him to do so. 
  At the same time the president criticized Minsk for its call 
for forming a "Slav Union" between Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus. 
The call was made by a candidate for presidential elections in 
Belarus, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. 
  According to Kravchuk, the forming of such a union would 
lead 
to the emergence of "Asian, Muslim, and other unions, to a mass 
migration of people, and to war." 
  Kravchuk referred by way of an example to Trans-Dniestria, 
which would inevitably join the proposed Slav Union, while 
Moldova would join Romania.
