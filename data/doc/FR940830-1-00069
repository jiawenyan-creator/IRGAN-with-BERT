 

Based on the completed RI/FS, the ROD was issued on May 28, 1991, and EPA successfully negotiated a Consent Decree (lodged
February 25, 1992, entered April 23, 1992, Case Number 392CV10028 in the United States District
Court, Southern District of Iowa, Davenport Division) for Remedial Design/Remedial Action (RD/RA) activities
with DuPont. DuPont completed the RA at the Site in September 1993. As required by the ROD, the RA included: (1) All surface
waste materials not amenable to the selected technology, such as metal, grinding balls, and paint cans, were to be
removed and disposed at an off-site RCRA-permitted hazardous waste landfill prior to stabilization/ solidification,
(2) Construction of an on-site waste disposal cell,
(3) Stabilization/solidification of contaminated soils and placement in the on-site disposal cell, and
(4) Construction of a soil cap over the disposal cell. Restrictions on the future use and development of the Site were
included to ensure the integrity of the cover and the underlying, solidified soil mass and to prevent human contact
with treated soils. 
EPA in consultation with the State of Iowa, has determined that all fund-financed response activities under CERCLA
at the Dupont County Road X23 Site, Lee County, Iowa have been completed, and that no further response is necessary.
Therefore, it is proposed that the Site be deleted from the NPL.
