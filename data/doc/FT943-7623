FT  22 AUG 94 / International Company News: Maybank shows 46% advance to
MDollars 1.16bn
Malayan Bank, Malaysia's biggest financial institution, has reported a
pre-tax profit for the year ending June 30 1994 of MDollars 1.16bn (Dollars
451m), a 46 per cent increase on the previous year's figure.
The improvement puts Maybank firmly in the top echelon of Malaysia's
corporate money earners. Only Telekom Malaysia, the telecommunications
utility, and Tenaga Nasional, the electricity utility, both partially
privatised in recent years, have achieved MDollars 1bn plus profit levels.
Mr Amirsham Aziz, Maybank's managing director, said the advance was the
result of an expanded loans base, higher profits from foreign exchange
dealings, strong growth in fee-based activity and further improvement in the
quality of the bank's assets. The bank also benefited from the upsurge in
the equity market.
More than 80 per cent of Maybank's profits came from operations within
Malaysia. Mr Amirsham said loan growth had been particularly strong - up
nearly 13 per cent compared with a 6 per cent growth in the rest of the
banking industry.
Mr Amirsham said that future prospects were good, given the continued strong
growth of the Malaysian economy.
He said that efforts were being made to diversify Maybank's earnings base in
the face of stronger competition from other institutions. Maybank now plans
to make its presence felt elsewhere in the region.
Financial analysts describe Maybank as one of Malaysia's most conservatively
managed institutions. They say that while the bank has performed well in the
protected domestic market, it might find profits more difficult to achieve
as it exposes itself to competition overseas.
