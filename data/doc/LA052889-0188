MINT'S ERROR MAKES SOME QUARTERS COLLECTORS' ITEMS 
Coin experts say that some 1989 quarters could be worth hundreds of dollars 
each because the U.S. Mint unwittingly struck an unknown number of them without 
a mint mark. 
Readers of the Numismatic News, a weekly based in Iola, Wis., sent in two 1989 
quarters missing the mint mark, the New York Times reported. 
A spokesman for Stack's, a New York coin dealer, said that such coins could be 
worth between $250 and $1,000 each, based on the value of other coins with 
similar errors.
