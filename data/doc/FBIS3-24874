  [Text] The Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] has 
accused the government of violating the General Peace Accord by 
moving militiamen at Sangage, Nampula Province, an area that is 
under Renamo's control. Notification of this was made during a 
meeting of the Cease-Fire Commission this morning. 
  Asked to comment on the issue, the government's Major 
Eduardo 
Alexandre said it was a regular movement that will eventually 
culminate with the abolition of militia forces. Some time ago, 
the government troops that had occupied Sangage after the 
General Peace Accord were forced to withdraw by the Cease-Fire 
Commission. 
  Meanwhile, Renamo soldies are moving toward Salamanga 
Assembly Area in Maputo Province. This area has not yet been 
approved because of a dispute between the government and Renamo.
