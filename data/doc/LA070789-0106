ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: SANTA ANA HEIGHTS; 
7 AIRPORT-AREA HOMES ADDED TO NOISE LIST 
A slight increase in average noise levels at John Wayne Airport has added seven 
homes to a list of 73 in the Santa Ana Heights area that must be insulated or 
removed from residential use under state regulations, airport officials said 
this week. 
Officials said the homes will be insulated, purchased by the county or be 
rezoned as business-use land. The seven homes are in the area of Pegasus and 
Indus streets and Orchard Drive. 
So far, four of the 80 residences now in the noise impact zone have been bought 
by the county; the remainder are at various stages of processing for either 
insulation or purchase by the county. 
No specific reason was found for the slight noise increase during the period 
from Jan. 1 to March 31, although officials reported major technical problems 
that resulted in repairs to one of the noise-monitoring devices stationed in 
the area. 
And actual average daily jet operations -- takeoffs and landings -- decreased 
slightly from 206 in the previous quarter to 205 during the three months ending 
March 31, according to a study released by the airport staff. In the first 
quarter of 1988, the daily average was 206 jet operations. 
Although average noise levels had increased, the number of citizen complaints 
declined 22% during the first quarter of 1989, county noise abatement officials 
said, compared to the previous quarter, and were down 6.8% compared to the 
first three months of 1988. 
Historically, county officials said, complaints have peaked during increased 
political activity involving airport planning decisions, but otherwise have not 
necessarily followed a particular pattern.
