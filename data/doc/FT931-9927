FT  11 FEB 93 / Clinton signs orders to reduce government payroll and perks
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday continued his attack on excessive federal
employment by signing executive orders designed to reduce the government
payroll by 100,000 over the next four years.
He also directed departments to cut their management costs by 3 per cent a
year over the next four years, to get rid of as many as one third of
existing advisory boards and commissions, and to eliminate a wide range of
the perks available to senior bureaucrats.
The president estimated net savings of about Dollars 9bn and repeated his
exhortation of Tuesday, when he announced a 25 per cent reduction in the
White House staff, that government must learn to get by on less. 'This is
only a beginning, not the end,' he added.
Additionally, Mr Bruce Babbitt, the interior secretary, announced that he
was reviewing special bonus payments made to senior members of his
department by Mr Manuul Lujan, his predecessor. The leitmotif of Mr
Clinton's drive to cut the size and cost of government is the presumed
excesses of the Bush and Reagan administrations.
Most of the job savings will be achieved by natural wastage, not
redundancies, the White House said. All departmental plans must be in place
by 1995. Total federal employment is around 3m, including the notionally
independent and 800,000-strong postal service.
Mr Clinton was expected to make much of his symbolic lead in cutting federal
spending at a televised 'town meeting' in Detroit, due to take place late
last night.
Mr Babbitt said his most interesting discovery was the 'pony perk,' a plan
to expand a federally maintained equestrian complex for the convenience of
government officials. That particular plan is dead as of today,' he said.
