<F P=106> [Interview with Jovan Zametica, adviser to Bosnian Serb </F>
leader Radovan Karadzic, by Jozsef Szabo; place and date not 
given: "According to Karadzic, Territorial Concessions Cannot Be 
Made"] 
  [Text] The Bosnian Serbs consider joining the 
Bosnian-Croatian confederation to be impossible. Jovan 
Zametica, adviser to Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, gave 
an interview to NEPSZABADSAG on the new situation in the 
area. 
  [Szabo] Why did the Serbs "accidentally" leave weapons at 
Sarajevo? 
  [Zametica] The weapons were not hidden, they did not even 
need to be discovered. The UN Blue Helmets had precise 
information on their location from before. The Serbs were not 
hiding these weapons. This is a case of different 
interpretations of the boundaries of the demilitarized zone 
around Sarajevo. 
  [Szabo] Where were these weapons? 
  [Zametica] According to the Serbian side, they were a few 
hundred meters outside the 20-kilometer limit of the 
demilitarized zone defined by the United Nations. The 
misunderstanding came from the fact that the Blue Helmets and 
the Serbs determined Sarajevo's center differently and marked 
the 20 kilometers from this point. 
  [Szabo] What will happen to the weapons? 
  [Zametica] We agreed with a general of the Blue Helmets that 
we would jointly define Sarajevo's center on the map and we will 
then measure the 20 kilometers from there. If Serbian heavy 
artillery happens to be in this area then we will withdraw it or 
place it under UN supervision. 
  [Szabo] What are your views on the Croatian-Bosnian 
agreement? 
  [Zametica] We have many reasons for caution when it comes to 
any kind of alliances between the Croatians and the Bosnians. 
It is their business if they want to live together, we have no 
say in this. Our only requirement is that their confederation 
must not cause any territorial or military damage to the Serbs. 
  [Szabo] Is it possible for the Serbs to also join this 
confederation? 
  [Zametica] The chance is minimal. 
  [Szabo] In this case, according to Moscow, you will have to 
make further territorial concessions. 
  [Zametica] At the peace talks, the Serbs have always made 
certain concessions. However, there is a limit after which we 
will not make any more concessions. 
  [Szabo] Where is this limit? 
  [Zametica] It is not easy to give exact percentages of the 
Serbian areas, although Karadzic recently said that he wants to 
keep 56 to 58 percent of Bosnia's territory. Our goal is to 
live in compact areas. 
  [Szabo] Nevertheless, you have recently been forced to make 
concessions. 
  [Zametica] Territorial concessions are out of the question. 
We have only removed our artillery from around Sarajevo. We did 
not make any concessions at Tuzla, either; we agreed to opening 
the airport under certain conditions, but this has not yet 
happened. The UN plane was able to land on 22 March with our 
agreement. Talks are still underway on opening the airport. We 
will not let ourselves be excluded from the supervision. We did 
not make any territorial concessions at Maglaj, either, we only 
agreed to the delivery of aid to the city. To the outsider it 
may seem that we are making territorial concessions, but what we 
are trying to do is to facilitate an overall Bosnian peace 
agreement through compromises.
