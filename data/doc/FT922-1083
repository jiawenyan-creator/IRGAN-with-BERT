FT  24 JUN 92 / Observer: Age concern
When Conrad Black bought the Telegraph in 1986 its readers were so old they
were dying at the rate of 1,000 a week. Helped by the introduction of a
children's supplement, Black has managed to reverse this unhappy trend and
now a quarter of his readers are under 34.
However, older readers are still well represented on the group's board. Of
the 16 non-executives, two are in their 80s and four are in their 70s.
Yesterday's prospectus says that no one is disqualified from being a
director just because he is 70, nor will the age of a proposed board member
need to be stated when the appointment comes up for discussion at a general
meeting.
Given the growing age gap between the Telegraph's board and its readers,
perhaps the 47-year-old Black should consider making a bid for The Oldie
magazine. After all, it seems to be doing better in terms of circulation
than the Spectator, the Telegraph's loss-making magazine for young fogeys.
