CURRENT PAPERBACKS: IN THE GARDEN OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MARTYRS BY TOBIAS WOLF 
(ECCO PRESS: $8.95) 
Although many of the stories in this anthology are set in the Pacific 
Northwest, Tobias Wolff's talent transcends regional boundaries. In crisp, 
hard-edged prose, he delineates bleak miniature worlds that encompass the 
disillusionment of contemporary life. 
The reader watches with impotent alarm as a botched practical joke releases the 
hatred and fear needed to commit murder in "Hunters in the Snow." In the title 
story, the smug hypocrisy of a faculty search committee forces a shy professor 
to speak the truth in her lecture. Citing the example of the Iroquois, she 
admonishes her dumbfounded students to "Be kind. Do justice. Walk humbly." On a 
lighter note, in "The Liar," a young man discovers that falsehood can become so 
gloriously entertaining that it appears more vivid than the truth. An 
exceptional collection of short fiction.
