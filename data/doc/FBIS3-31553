  [Text] Pale -- What has been done about Sarajevo has been 
done, it seems to me, in the best possible way, states General 
Manojlo Milovanovic, head of the general staff of the army of 
the Srpska republic. The combat readiness of the 
Sarajevo-Romanija Corps has not been disturbed one bit, although 
we had to give in a little and put certain artillery pieces 
under [UN] control. However, these artillery pieces are still 
operational, their ammunition is beside them, and they can act 
at any moment, Milovanovic says. 
  According to Gen. Milovanovic, these events may be "the 
beginning of the end of the war" if a political solution is 
found for Sarajevo, as is being announced. If a political 
solution is not found within the next month, the end of the war 
will still be far away.
