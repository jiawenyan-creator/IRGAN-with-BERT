<F P=106> ["Text" of letter from acting Attorney General Maruicio </F>
Echeverri to Prosecutor General Gustavo De Greiff on 25 February] 
  [Text] Per the conversation we had this morning in which 
you voiced your concern about a statement I allegedly made 
saying that this office would stop participating in the 
surrender to justice process of persons allegedly linked to drug 
trafficking in Valle del Cauca, allow me to clarify: 
  The Attorney General's Office will not dissociate itself 
from 
the process inasmuch as Article 44 of Law 81, 1993, establishes 
a clear and legal obligation to directly participate in each of 
the criminal cases that could begin against people who request 
benefits for effectively collaborating with justice, according 
to the terms established in Law 81. 
  It is obvious that the presence of the Attorney General's 
Office, in the conversations that have taken place so far, only 
seeks to learn about the circumstances surrounding the 
establishment of bases that could result in the benefits 
established by the law. 
  As the legal circumstances may merit, the Office of the 
Attorney General of the nation will independently define its 
stand with regard to each case. Yours truly, [Signed] Mauricio 
Echeverri, attorney general of the nation
