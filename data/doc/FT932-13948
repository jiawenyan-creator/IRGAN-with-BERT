FT  21 APR 93 / The Lex Column: New issues
It would be unwise to get carried away by the apparent success of recent
flotations. The Stock Exchange's combined placings and offers for sale
system lends itself to a little hyperbole. Yesterday the announcement of
Stagecoach's flotation focused on an oversubscription of 7.9 times. Well,
not quite. It is true that the 11.05m shares on offer to the public
attracted applications for 86.8m shares - a subscription of 7.9 times or an
over-subscription of 6.9 times. But that ignores the 21.8m shares placed
with institutions and the 1.2m shares reserved for directors et al. When
they are addded back, the total offer was subscribed 2.6 times and
oversubscribed only 1.6 times.
