  [Text] Moscow, 15 Jun -- The State Duma today adopted at 
its second reading the federal law "On State Protection for 
Judges, Officials, and Bodies of Law Enforcement and Control." 
  The law ensures protection for judges, officials, and bodies 
of law enforcement and control whose functions may put their 
safety in peril. 
  Viktor Mironov, deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee 
for Security, who presented the law to the deputies, expressed 
the hope that "this law will make it possible for staff of the 
law enforcement bodies to start combating crime in earnest."
