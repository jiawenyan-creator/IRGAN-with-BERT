BOXING; 
JACKSON WINS WBC MIDDLEWEIGHT TITLE 
Julian Jackson knocked out Herol Graham of Britain in the fourth round Saturday 
night to win the vacant World Boxing Council middleweight championship. 
Graham, the British middleweight champion, dominated the first three rounds, 
scoring with a variety of combinations and frustrating Jackson, who was missing 
wildly. 
But midway through the fourth round, when it appeared Graham (34-3) was in 
control, Jackson suddenly floored Graham with a short right hand. 
He was counted out by referee Joe Cortez of Atlantic City, N.J. Graham was on 
the canvas for more than five minutes. 
Jackson's victory gave him the WBC middleweight crown, vacant since Sugar Ray 
Leonard retired earlier this year. He also holds the World Boxing Assn. light 
middleweight crown. 
Jackson (42-1, 39 knockouts), from the U.S. Virgin Islands, scored his 34th 
consecutive knockout.
