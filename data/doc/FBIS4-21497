  [Text] Jihlava, South Moravia, March 23 (CTK) -- The Hnuti 
Duha (Rainbow Movement) environmental group has issued an appeal 
against the granting of a construction permit for a temporary 
store of radioactive waste on the grounds of the Dukovany 
nuclear power plant, Martin Sedlacek from Hnuti Duha told CTK. 
  The organization is requesting that the project be postponed 
until its main investor has supplied some missing information, 
Sedlacek added. 
  Hnuti Duha has notified the Czech Economics Ministry that 
the 
containers in which the nuclear waste is to be temporarily 
stored have not been licensed in Germany where they were 
produced. According to the Duha organization, which is one of 
the participants in the process, the exact means of waste 
disposal in the project should be demonstrated now during the 
selection of an investor, rather than after he has been chosen. 
  Hnuti Duha also disagrees with the exclusion of Dukovany 
district representatives in participating in the project's 
selection process. 
  The construction permit was granted by the regional office 
in 
Trebic, south Moravia, on 1 March. Other participants in the 
selection process have until the end of this week to issue their 
own appeals. After a period of administrative negotiation the 
Czech Economics Ministry will rule on the appeals.
