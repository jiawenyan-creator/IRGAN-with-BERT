FT  06 OCT 94 / Tyne councils in job-creation plea
Leaders of three Tyneside councils yesterday urged the government to support
a six-point plan, Regenerating Tyneside, to tackle the recent wave of job
cuts in an area already suffering persistent high unemployment.
The leaders of Labour-controlled Newcastle, North and South Tyneside
councils say in a letter to Mr John Major, the prime minister, that without
a significant package of job-creation measures, particularly in high
technology and modern manufacturing, the Tyneside economy may never recover
from the 'deluge' of recent job cuts and closures.
During a visit to the area this morning, Mr Ian Taylor, Tyne and Wear
sponsor minister, will announce measures to assist Tyneside's regeneration.
These may include an enterprise zone. This is subject to European Commission
approval and was first suggested by the government last year when Swan
Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, went into receivership. However, the
government's aid package may fall short of the scale the local authorities
want.
The councils' plan includes government support for:
Retention of shipbuilding on the Tyne.
Development of marine engineering companies including oil and gas
technology.
Early construction of a new Tyne crossing.
More high-quality vocational training initiatives.
Large-scale reclamation and development projects.
Mr John Foster, executive director of North Tyneside Council, said: 'We are
talking about a package in the tens of millions of pounds.'
In the past 18 months Tyneside has lost its last colliery, while its last
shipbuilder, Swan Hunter, has shed 2,000 jobs and faces closure. The
offshore fabrication sector has cut about 1,000 jobs.
