ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; 
HEIGHT PLAN TO GET FURTHER HEARING 
The City Council on Wednesday voted to continue until Jan. 17 a public hearing 
on a proposed law that would restrict home heights to preserve views. 
As proposed, the law would create a 25-foot height restriction in neighborhoods 
in which residents have requested it. 
"It's patently unfair," Lee Riley, who recently bought property in San 
Clemente, told the council Wednesday night. "You can't go and change the rules 
now that we've bought the property." Riley was one of a few people to speak 
about the matter before the council voted to continue the hearing. 
Residents in ocean-view neighborhoods complained to the council in May that new 
construction was obstructing their views of the water and reducing their 
property values. At the time, the council voted down a proposed emergency 
moratorium on new building. 
Last month, the Planning Commission unanimously recommended that the council 
reject the proposed zoning plan, saying the city should not regulate the issue 
of views from private property. The commissioners urged that height questions 
be solved through homeowners' association regulations.
