110. Section 86.133790 of subpart N is amended by revising 
paragraphs (a)(7), (a)(8), (a)(13), (a)(20) and (a)(26) to read as 
follows: 



86.133790 

Engine dynamometer test run. 




(a) *** 

(7) For diesel engines tested for particulate emissions, 
carefully install a clean particulate sample filter into each of 
the filter holders and install the assembled filter holders in the 
sample flow line (filter holders may be preassembled). 

(8) Follow the manufacturers choke and throttle instructions 
for cold starting. Simultaneously start the engine and begin 
exhaust and dilution air sampling. For petroleum-fueled diesel 
engines (and natural gas-fueled, liquified petroleum gas-fueled or 
methanol-fueled diesels, if used), turn on the hydrocarbon and NO

X

 (and CO and CO

2

, if continuous) analyzer system integrators (if 
used), and turn on the particulate sample pumps and indicate the 
start of the test on the data collection medium.

(13) Immediately after the engine is turned off, turn off the 
engine cooling fan(s) if used, and the CVS blower (or disconnect 
the exhaust system from the CVS). As soon as possible, transfer 
the ``cold start cycle'' exhaust and dilution air bag samples 
according to 86.1340. A stabilized reading of the exhaust sample 
on all analyzers shall be obtained within 20 minutes of the end of 
the sample collection phase of the test. Analysis of the methanol 
and formaldehyde samples shall be obtained within 24 hours of the 
end of the sample collection period. For diesel engines tested for 
particulate, carefully remove the filter holder from the sample 
flow apparatus, remove each particulate sample filter from its 
holder and place each in a petri dish and cover. 


* * * * * 



(20) For diesel engines tested for particulate, carefully 
install a clean particulate filter in each of the filter holders 
and install assembled filter holders in the sample flow line 
(filter holders may be preassembled). 


* * * * * 



(26) As soon as possible, transfer the ``hot start cycle'' exhaust 
and dilution air bag samples to the analytical system and process 
the samples according to 86.1340. A stabilized reading of the 
exhaust sample on all analyzers shall be obtained within 20 minutes 
of the end of the sample collection phase of the test. Analyze the 
methanol and formaldehyde samples within 24 hours. (If it is not 
possible to perform analysis within 24 hours, the samples should be 
stored in a cold (approximately 0
&cir;C) dark environment until 
analysis can be performed). For diesel engines tested for 
particulate, carefully remove the assembled filter holder from the 
sample flow lines and remove each particulate sample filter from 
its holder and place in a clean petri dish and cover as soon as 
possible. Within one hour after the end of the hot start phase of 
the test, transfer the four particulate filters to the weighing 
chamber for post-test conditioning.
