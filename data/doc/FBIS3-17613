  [Text] Over 70 percent of the electorate took part in 
parliamentary elections in Ukraine yesterday. The population 
was most active in western regions. Only in four of the 450 
districts were the elections invalid. According to information 
up to 2100 on 27 March, the elections in Crimea to the Ukrainian 
Supreme Soviet were invalid in only one electoral district. 
  INTERFAX says that, according to preliminary information, 
former Supreme Soviet Speaker Ivan Plyushch, Rukh leader 
Vyacheslav Chornovil, former Deputy Prime Minister Viktor 
Pynzenik, and leader of the Ukrainian conservatives Stepan 
Khmara were elected as deputies to the new parliament in the 
first round of voting. Leonid Kuchma, leader of the 
inter-regional reform bloc, got the biggest number of votes, 
with 91 percent. 
  In Kuchma's opinion, the results of the elections, as well 
as 
the situation with the republic's basic law, do not allow 
presidential elections to be postponed to a later date. I will 
remind you that they should take place in Ukraine in June 1994. 
President Leonid Kravchuk has said several times that the 
election must be postponed. He is worried that a power vacuum 
could arise during the presidential candidates' election 
campaign, while the new parliament has still not been formed. 
In his turn, Leonid Kuchma pointed out that this is an attempt 
by the president to delay a civilized turnover in all branches 
of power. 
  The Crimean Supreme Soviet elections were valid. Over 60 
percent of the electorate took part. Simferopol was least 
active of all, while the electoral districts where Crimean 
Tatars and Armenians live were most active. I will remind you 
that a referendum on relations with Ukraine and dual citizenship 
on the peninsula was held simultaneously with the elections. 
The results of the poll are still unknown.
