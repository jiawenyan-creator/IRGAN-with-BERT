  [Text] Baghdad, 6 Mar (INA)--As'ad Bayyud al-Tamimi, 
leader of the Islamic Jihad-Bayt al-Maqdis movement, has 
stressed that Iraq is, God willing, strengthened by Islam, the 
Koran, and the faithful leadership. 
  In a cable he sent to President Saddam Husayn on the 
occasion 
of holy Ramadan, al-Tamimi beseeched God Almighty to grant the 
Muslims victory at his excellency's hands and to defeat the 
infidels who are colluding against the Muslim nation so that 
Iraq can devote its total attention to the cause of Palestine, 
which is now being sold at the U.S. and world slave market. 
  Al-Tamimi added that the polytheists were defeated in the 
two 
Qadisiyahs and will, God Almighty willing, soon be defeated and 
the flag of Allahu Akbar [God is great] will fly over the heads 
of the soldiers marching on Jerusalem, as they marched in 
Ramadan to the battle of Badr and to Mecca, the birthplace of 
Islam.
