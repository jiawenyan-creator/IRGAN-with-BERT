FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Ahold raises retail holdings in
Portugal
AHOLD, the Dutch retail and supermarket group, said yesterday its Portuguese
joint venture, Jeronimo Martins Retail (JMR), planned to take full control
of a large Portuguese supermarket chain, Ino Supermercados.
The deal will add 54 supermarkets and annual sales of some Dollars 200m to
the JMR joint venture, which presently consists of 40 Pingo Doce chain
stores with annual sales of over Dollars 300m. JMR now enjoys a 10 per cent
market share in Portuguese food retailing. An Ahold spokesman said the terms
of the deal would be finalised and disclosed 'within several weeks'.
Est. Jeronimo Martins &amp; Filho Holding, the leading Portuguese food producer
which is the 51 per cent majority shareholder in JMR, has already acquired
Inovacao Sgps, the parent company of Ino Supermercados.
As part of the deal, two other Inovacao subsidiaries - a chain of mainly
non-retail hypermarkets, called Feira Nova FN, and a smaller cash-and-carry
operation - were also acquired.
Discussions are under way between Ahold and Jeronimo Martins as to whether
the Feira Nova operation, with annual sales of Dollars 210m, should also be
absorbed by JMR. Ahold stressed yesterday that its primary business interest
remained food retailing.
When JMR was formed in July last year, Ahold paid Es7.7bn (Dollars 54.4m)
for its 49 per cent stake. The Pingo Doce chain was fully-owned by Jeronimo
Martins. Under the terms of the venture, both partners have equal voting
rights and take key management decisions unanimously.
