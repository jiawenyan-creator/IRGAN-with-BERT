THE NATION 
Thunderstorms soaked much of the nation's midsection and portions of the West. 
There was flooding in northern Texas, where the storms dropped five inches of 
rain in Lucas and covered Highway 69 near Greenville with three feet of water. 
Winds gusted up to 50 m.p.h. in Barton County in central Kansas. More than two 
inches of rain fell in an hour at Kansas City International Airport. The 
mercury in Upper Michigan dropped to a record low of 36 degrees in Marquette. 
In the West, an area of low pressure extended from the desert Southwest across 
Nevada to Idaho. Unstable air produced thunderstorms across portions of eastern 
Washington, Idaho, Montana and across the New Mexico and Colorado Rockies.
