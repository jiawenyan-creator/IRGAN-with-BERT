SOVIET UNION 
Every day we are bombarded by the media with more and more news of events 
occurring in the Soviet Union and are told how quickly the Soviets are 
"democratizing." 
I hope that as democracy is phased in, the structure of the Soviet Union is 
phased out because the two cannot exist together. If you have democracy, you 
cannot have a Soviet empire because the two are a contradiction in terms and 
meaning. This is especially important in view of how many people were destroyed 
during and after the formation of the Soviet Union. Let us not forget those who 
were so wantonly annihilated in body and spirit.
