  [Text] Who is the successor of Melchior Ndadaye, the 
Burundian president who was assassinated last October? The 
Front for Democracy in Burundi [FRODEBU] party organized a 
meeting of its high-ranking officials in Bujumbura yesterday in 
order to identify the candidate for the post of future head of 
state. The name of the person to replace President Ndadaye will 
be made known tomorrow. But already a name is circulating in 
the Burundian capital. Celcius Nsengiyunva reports. 
  [Nsengiyunva] Only two hours were needed for the FRODEBU 
high-ranking officials to agree on the name of the person to be 
put forward for the post of president of the Republic, but the 
name of the person to replace the assassinated Melchior Ndadaye 
had already been [words indistinct] of the FRODEBU party and the 
current session was just a formality. Although the president of 
FRODEBU, Mr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, did not reveal the name 
to the press, the name of his party's candidate -- the name on 
all lips in Bujumbura -- is that of the current minister of 
agriculture and livestock, Mr. Cyprien Ntaryamira. The 
president of FRODEBU, in fact, minutes later [word indistinct] 
militants, said it by declaring "we chose for you a man that you 
know well, who is very close to farmers". 
  In fact the choice of Mr. Cyprien Ntaryamira is certainly 
the 
result of the political bargaining which has been going on for 
some days with the opposition and the civil service. From the 
moment that the majority of people accept that the future 
president must come from the party which won the elections of 
last June, there is a need for a candidate who reassures both 
the Hutu and Tutsi communities. By remaining very discreet all 
through the current crisis, Mr. Ntaryamira has been able to win 
the trust of everybody.
