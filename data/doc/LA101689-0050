CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
YOSEMITE; 
WORKERS DISMANTLE HALF DOME STAIRWAY 
Workers at Yosemite National Park will climb high above the floor of Yosemite 
Valley to dismantle a ladder-like system of cables used as a stairway to the 
summit of Half Dome, one of the world's most recognizable rock formations. The 
two shoulder-high cables stretch straight up a cliff near the top of the 
8,842-foot granite dome. The cables are dismantled every fall because it is too 
dangerous for inexperienced hikers to visit the summit during winter.
