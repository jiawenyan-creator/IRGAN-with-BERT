  [Excerpts] Joseph Kengo Wa Dondo was appointed prime 
minister of Zaire yesterday, an appointment that was immediately 
disputed by the opposition--or at least that part of the 
opposition that still supports Etienne Tshisekedi. [passage 
omitted] 
  The opposition did not take part in the appointment of the 
new prime minister. Monsignor Monsengwo, chairman of the High 
Council of the Republic--Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT], was 
in Europe at the time. Herve de Guelink in Brussels asked him 
to comment after this decision: 
  [Begin Monsengwo recording] Adopting a position like this, 
in 
fact, falls within the competence of the High Court of Justice, 
and not of the Presidency of the HCR-PT. We refuse to give it 
our backing. The event you have referred to is the kind of 
thing that drives certain persons into illegal acts and illegal 
procedures. So we warned everyone against actions that might 
compromise the social peace. 
  We did not take any liberties since we were not involved in 
this action. We were both abroad, so what has happened has 
happened. The legality or constitutionality of the proceeding is 
a matter for the Supreme Court, and not for the chairman of the 
High Council of the Republic. [end recording]
