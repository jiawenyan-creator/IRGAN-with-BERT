FT  26 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Istanbul transport plan
The ACER GROUP has been commissioned for work on the second phase, worth
about Pounds 50m, of the Istanbul light rail system - Ferhatposa to the
airport - by the Istanbul Metropolitan Authority. Phase one, which runs from
Aksaray to Esenler, was put into operation in November 1990.
Work on the second phase is expected to start soon. Construction of the 10.4
kilometres between Ferhatposa (central coach station) and the airport will
continue for the following 26 months.
The Acer Group has been awarded the contract to carry out the engineering
and construction supervision services on this phase. This includes a
detailed review of the design; highlighting any problems and offering
solutions to facilitate construction; and ensuring work is completed in
accordance with the technical specifications and within the scheduled time
and budget.
The company will be responsible for the construction supervision of several
major structures; eight stations; cut-and-cover and bored tunnels; three
viaducts; and 10 bridges.
The total development will have three different rings and be about 109
kilometres in length.
A central location is proposed at Yenikapi, from where all main rail and sea
transport will depart.
