FT  02 JUL 93 / Foreigners restricted in French sell-off
THE French government will restrict investors outside the European Community
to a maximum of 20 per cent of the shares of the companies sold in its
forthcoming privatisation drive.
Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, had originally hoped to abolish all
restrictions on foreign investment in the new privatisation legislation.
However, his government has agreed to accept a Senate amendment to
reintroduce the old 20 per cent limit imposed on the last state asset sales
during the mid-1980s.
The limit will apply to noyaux durs, the long-term investors who, the
government hopes, will take strategic stakes in privatised firms.
Partenariats, or companies involved in commercial joint ventures with state
firms due to be privatised, will be exempt. This means the limit would not
affect the long-mooted merger of Renault, the state-controlled motor group,
and Volvo, its Swedish partner.
The privatisation bill, which would enable the government to sell up to 21
public sector concerns from September, is expected to be passed on Monday.
France produced a record monthly trade surplus of FFr7.09bn (Pounds 826m) in
March, against FFr5.34bn in February, thereby ensuring that the trading
account stayed in the black throughout the first quarter, with a surplus of
FFr16.2bn.
However, the record surplus was due to a sharp fall in imports, to FFr84.4m
from FFr105bn in the equivalent month last year, reflecting the sluggishess
of the French economy. The level of exports fell to FFr91.5bn from FFr107bn
in March 1992.
