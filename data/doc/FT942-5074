FT  07 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Chile in favour of ties with Mercosur
Brazil's proposal to use the planned Mercosur common market as a building
block for a South American free trade area has been backed by Chile, which
could next month start negotiating to join Mercosur as an 'associate'
member.
Brazilian officials said this would also mark the first step towards Chile's
full membership of Mercosur.
Mr Carlos Figueroa Serrano, Chile's foreign minister, said his country was
interested in joining Mercosur, which groups Brazil with Argentina, Paraguay
and Uruguay. He intends to discuss the matter with Argentina later this
week. Chile will, however, continue to negotiate its entry into Nafta, still
seen as the country's priority.
Chile is an especially welcome partner for Brazil, which has been trying to
tie other countries into the Mercosur network. Mercosur is due to become a
customs union, with a common external tariff for most goods, from January 1
next year. Countries wanting 'associate' trading ties with Mercosur will
have to remove barriers on trade with Mercosur members, but will not be
bound by the common external tariff rules.
Brazil has been discussing the South American free trade area with other
countries for several months. But Chile is the first publicly to express
definite interest in joining.
Chile is seen as the South American country most prepared to join Nafta. By
joining Mercosur as well, it would show other countries that it was possible
to be a member of both trade areas. Chile's intention to negotiate some form
of association with Mercosur reflects concern in the country, which is
highly dependent on exports, of being left on the sidelines of the region's
emerging free-trade blocs.
Brazil and Argentina are Chile's third and fourth biggest trading partners
respectively.
