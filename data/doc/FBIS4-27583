  [Text] Seoul, June 2 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry 
lodged a complaint Thursday against a European Union (EU) 
decision to withdraw Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) 
treatment for South Korean fabric products, calling it unfair 
abuse of the system. 
  "The government believes it was unjust for the EU to link 
the 
GSP issue with South Korea's introduction of an adjustment 
tariff and thereby expresses regrets," a Ministry official said 
in a commentary. 
  "The government points out again that GSP status, by its 
very 
nature, should not be used as a tool of countermeasure and urges 
the EU to repeal the decision," the official said. 
  The European Union finalized its decision Tuesday to halt 
GSP 
treatment for South Korean fabric goods from July 1 until Seoul 
withdraws its adjustment tariff on foreign products. 
  In January this year, Seoul introduced a 19-percent 
adjustment tariff on fabric imports for 1994 to minimize the 
impact on local firms caused by an unexpected inflow of foreign 
products. 
  South Korea stands to bear an additional 10.2-percent burden 
in customs tariffs on affected export items as a result of GSP 
withdrawal, totaling an estimated 5.8 million U.S. dollars. 
  Industry officials predicted that Korea will lose about 1.4 
million dollars in exports to Europe due to the EU measure.
