RODRIGUEZ ON POLICE BRUTALITY 
Obviously, no useful purpose would be served by attempting to contradict 
Rodriguez's diatribe against law enforcement. However, I can and will dispute 
his facts. 
In the third paragraph, Rodriguez states " . . . two off-duty Los Angeles 
County deputies and a Maywood officer stormed a Maywood city jail cell and beat 
Marino D. Castillo. . . ." 
In the first place, the precautionary term "allegedly" might be a wise idea to 
insert in this statement. I have noted that this is standard practice for The 
Times when talking about murderers and rapists, but apparently not when talking 
about police officers. 
Secondly, if Rodriguez wishes to attack the police, perhaps he should at least 
accuse the correct department. In the original account of the incident, 
published in The Times, it was very clearly stated that the two deputy sheriffs 
allegedly involved were from the Orange County Sheriff's Department, not Los 
Angeles County. 
As a sergeant (and a sworn deputy) on the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department, I feel that by his statement, Rodriguez has incorrectly and 
unfairly besmirched my reputation and that of my colleagues.
