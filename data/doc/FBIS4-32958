  [Text] Sources at the (CAPA) French television production 
company have announced that they have signed a contract with 
Cuba granting them international rights to the purchase and 
distribution of Cuban Institute of Cinematographic Arts and 
Industry [ICAIC] films on video, which have never been seen 
outside of Cuba. These 35mm movies, most of which are in black 
and white, belong to the weekly magazines the ICAIC used to 
produce. AFP has confirmed that Cuban authorities will retain 
exclusive rights to the distribution of the documentaries in 
Latin America.
