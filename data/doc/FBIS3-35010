  [Text] Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq said the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] will continue to defend the security zone in 
south Lebanon and will use all the means at its disposal against 
Hizballah. Part of the struggle is taking place inside the 
security zone and part beyond it, the chief of staff said. He 
added that the war in Lebanon is against both Shiites and the 
Lebanese, which makes it more difficult for SLA [South Lebanese 
Army] soldiers. Lieutenant General Baraq made his remarks in an 
address to Jerusalem high school students. These remarks were 
brought to us by correspondent Ya'el Ben-Yehuda. 
  Gen. Baraq also said that the defense burden imposed on 
reserve soldiers this year is similar to that prior to the 
intifadah. The IDF decided to impose an additional defense 
burden in Judaea, Samaria, the Gaza Strip, and the Lebanese 
border on the 19 and 20-year-olds draftees and not their older 
brothers and fathers, who as civilians are at the peak of their 
careers.
