LOCAL; 
2,400 AFFECTED BY POWER OUTAGES 
Sporadic power outages left about 2,400 utility customers in hillside areas of 
Studio City and Hollywood without electricity early today, the Department of 
Water and Power said. 
An unknown problem in an underground line began disrupting power from a 
distribution station in the 8700 block of Mulholland Drive on Tuesday evening, 
DWP spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen said. The problem was repaired by 7:45 a.m. 
today, she said. 
The area affected by the outages in Studio City was north of Mulholland between 
Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Woodrow Wilson Drive in neighborhoods south of 
Ventura Boulevard, Jensen said. On the other side of the hill, the outages 
spread as far as West Hollywood. 
Some areas lost electricity for as little as two minutes while other utility 
customers had intermittent outages from four to five hours.
