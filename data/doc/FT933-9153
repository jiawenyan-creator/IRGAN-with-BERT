FT  11 AUG 93 / Letter: Monetary union may not be so hard to achieve
Sir, Commentators on the recent changes in the exchange rate mechanism seem
largely agreed that monetary union has become less likely. Some have even
claimed that the Maastricht process is now dead.
Careful reading of the treaty and its protocols may suggest a different
picture.
Article 3 of the protocol on the convergence criteria specifies that: 'The
criterion on participation in the exchange rate mechanism. . . shall mean
that a member state has respected the normal fluctuation margins provided
for by the exchange rate mechanism. . . without severe tensions for at least
the last two years before the examination.'
Since the changes to the ERM take the form of a broadening of the 'normal
fluctuation margins', this criterion would now seem rather easier to fulfil
than was the case before.
