END OF THE VITACOURSE 
I am a regular user of the William R. Mason Regional Park. I frequently use the 
park for walks but mostly . . . run and exercise there in the morning before I 
go to work. Until May 10, the park had a VitaCourse routine available along 
trails in the western part of the facility. VitaCourse equipment allows users 
to exercise and stretch their bodies for a more complete workout than just 
jogging or walking. 
For no apparent reason, the manager of the park, without any attempt to assess 
the value of the Vitacourse and the frequency of its use, removed all of the 
equipment. He erroneously claimed that it was not being used, that it was in 
disrepair and that park users only wanted signs indicating how far they had 
run. 
I, for one, used the VitaCourse heavily and I saw others using it on numerous 
occasions. I don't understand why such unnecessary removals are made without 
questioning users, without providing supporting reasons and without review by 
the county.
