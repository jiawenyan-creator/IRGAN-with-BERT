FT  17 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Repola sets up ADR programme
Repola, Finland's biggest industrial group, is setting up a sponsored
American depositary receipt (ADR) programme to assist trading in its shares.
Mr Tauno Matomaki, Repola's chief executive, said the move reflected the
group's higher profile both in the US and worldwide.
The ADRs, each of which represents one share, will trade on the US
over-the-counter market. Citibank NA will act as the depositary and market
maker.
Repola's activities range from pulp and paper to engineering.
