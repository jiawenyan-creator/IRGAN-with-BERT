 

PART 1910_OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS 




1. The authority citation for subpart J of part 1910 continues to read as follows: 






Authority:

 Secs. 4, 6, and 8, Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C. 653, 655, 657; Secretary of Labor's Order No.
1271 (36 FR 8754), 876 (41 FR 25059), 983 (48 FR 35736) or 190 (55 FR 9033), as applicable.


Sections 1910.141, 1910.142, 1910.145, 1910.146, and 1910.147 also issued under 29 CFR part 1911. 



1910.146

[Amended]



2. The last sentence of paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of 1910.146 is amended by adding ``(1.52 m)'' between the words
``feet'' and ``deep.'' 

3. Section (2), 

Atmospheric monitoring,

 of Appendix E of 1910.146 is revised to read as follows:




(2) 

Atmospheric monitoring.

 Entrants should be trained in the use of, and be equipped with, atmospheric monitoring equipment which sounds an audible
alarm, in addition to its visual readout, whenever one of the following conditions are encountered: Oxygen concentration
less than 19.5 percent; flammable gas or vapor at 10 percent or more of the lower flammable limit (LFL); or hydrogen
sulfide or carbon monoxide at or above 10 ppm or 35 ppm, respectively, measured as an 8-hour time-weighted average.
Atmospheric monitoring equipment needs to be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oxygen
sensor/broad range sensor is best suited for initial use in situations where the actual or potential contaminants
have not been identified, because broad range sensors, unlike substance-specific sensors, enable employers to
obtain an overall reading of the hydrocarbons (flammables) present in the space. However, such sensors only indicate
that a hazardous threshold of a class of chemicals has been exceeded. They do not measure the levels of contamination
of specific substances. Therefore, substance-specific devices, which measure the actual levels of specific substances,
are best suited for use where actual and potential contaminants have been identified. The measurements obtained
with substance-specific devices are of vital importance to the employer when decisions are made concerning the measures
necessary to protect entrants (such as ventilation or personal protective equipment) and the setting and attainment
of appropriate entry conditions. However, the sewer environment may suddenly and unpredictably change, and the
substance-specific devices may not detect the potentially lethal atmospheric hazards which may enter the sewer
environment. 

Although OSHA considers the information and guidance provided above to be appropriate and useful in most sewer entry
situations, the Agency emphasizes that each employer must consider the unique circumstances, including the predictability
of the atmosphere, of the sewer permit spaces in the employer's workplace in preparing for entry. Only the employer
can decide, based upon his or her knowledge of, and experience with permit spaces in sewer systems, what the best type
of testing instrument may be for any specific entry operation. 

The selected testing instrument should be carried and used by the entrant in sewer line work to monitor the atmosphere
in the entrant's environment, and in advance of the entrant's direction of movement, to warn the entrant of any deterioration
in atmospheric conditions. Where several entrants are working together in the same immediate location, one instrument,
used by the lead entrant, is acceptable.
