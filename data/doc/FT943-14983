FT  12 JUL 94 / Observer: Waves of applause
Calling all opera buffs. Whether or not Verdi wrote Aida to mark the opening
of the Suez Canal in 1869 or the new Cairo Opera House, it is a mite
surprising that Sir Harrison Birtwhistle, or one of the Living Opera mob,
has let the inauguration of the Channel tunnel pass without offering up a
musical tribute.
It has been left to Paul Smith, organ builder, musician and security guard,
to pen an organ work which he has dedicated to the tunnel. If all goes well,
it will get its world premier in Trier Cathedral in Germany later this year.
Smith, a lay clerk in Ely Cathedral choir, is a humble sort and admits that
his work could double up as background music on Channel tunnel trains and in
the terminals. It is called Fantasy: Endure to the end, from a Biblical
quotation also borrowed by Mendelssohn for a chorus in his Elijah oratorio:
'He that shall endure to the end shall be saved'.
Given the constant delays which have dogged the Eurotunnel project in recent
months, it's just the sort of overture which should catch the fancy of a
promoter like Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's co-chairman.
