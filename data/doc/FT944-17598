FT  07 OCT 94 / People: Lonrho's chair filled temporarily
Sir John Leahy, the former British ambassador to South Africa, has been
appointed temporary chairman of Lonrho.
He replaces Rene Leclezio, with Lonrho for 30 years and chairman for the
past three, who in January agreed to stand down as part of a sweeping
reorganisation of the board.
Sir John, 66, and currently a vice chairman, takes up the post at the end of
the month.
Dieter Bock, the German financier who is Lonrho's joint chief executive, had
hoped to recruit an outsider to the post and had approached Eugene Anderson,
former chairman of electronics group Ferranti. However, Anderson's
appointment was opposed by Tiny Rowland, Bock's joint chief executive who,
until Bock's arrival at the beginning of last year, had been the dominant
force within the company for three decades.
Sir John is likely to remain chairman until there is a resolution of the
battle between the two chief executives for control of the company.
'Frankly, it is very difficult to recruit high quality people when there is
such uncertainty,' said a Lonrho employee.
More than a month ago, Bock's position in the company was weakened
considerably when his fellow directors forced him to abandon his plan to
propose to the board that Rowland should be stripped of his executive
powers.
