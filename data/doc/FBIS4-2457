dissidents detained Friday and Saturday during the visit of

dissidents said Monday. 
  Bao Ge, Wang Fucheng and Yang Zhou were able to return home 
Sunday, but were placed under house arrest for most of the day 
and their telephones were cut until Monday morning so that they 
could not speak with the press, the dissidents said.

from Shanghai, they added.
