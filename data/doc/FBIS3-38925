  [Text] Ankara, Feb.8 (AA) -- Premier Tansu Ciller said 
today that the plan formed during the Brussels meeting of the 
permanent representatives of the NATO a day before, could only 
be an "intermediate formula." 
  Support grew for a plan to demilitarize the Bosnian capital 
Sarajevo after a weekend mortar attack of Serbs killed 68 people 
and pushed the West closer to military intervention in Bosnia as 
the European Union backed the use of NATO air strikes to relieve 
the Serb-besieged city. 
  Ciller told journalists, before the executive board meeting 
of her True Path Party (DYP) that, "what's needed to protect 
these people is to conduct an air strike or to remove the arms 
embargo." 
  On the visit she and Pakistani Premier Benazir Bhutto paid 
on 
February 2 to Sarajevo, Ciller said "a violence of humanity was 
underway in Sarajevo. There, we called on the world to first 
support the basic right, the right to live of people, if we are 
to mention human rights." 
  "The decision taken by the permanent representatives of the 
NATO is a favorable steps, but not a sufficient one. 
  "The decision gives the impression of making a compromise," 
she said. 
  "I hope the plan does not prolong the existing situation 
there. Otherwise, this will be written to history not only as 
the disgrace of humanity, but of Europe," she added. 
  "The agreement reached in Brussels could be assessed as one 
which consumes time. And we hope it does not," she said.
