  [Text] The self-proclaimed Republic of Somaliland scored 
what it considered a very little victory this week in its battle 
for international recognition when neighboring Djibouti became 
the first country to acknowledge Somaliland as a state in its 
own right. Somaliland has unsuccessfully been calling for 
international recognition ever since it broke away from Somalia 
two years ago. Somaliland's minister of water and mineral 
resources, Mr. Mohamed Ali Ateye, is passing through London at 
the moment. In our studio, I asked him what difference, if any, 
recognition by Djibouti would make: 
  [Begin recording] [Ateye] Well, if you are talking in terms 
of financial aid, it won't make much in terms of rehabilitation 
or reconstruction that we need desperately, but some companies 
will be willing to...[pauses] who are interested in the, maybe, 
the oil prospection in our country were insisting that they will 
wait for some legal understanding, recognition from some 
countries. And we hope this is the beginning of having the 
world community to focus their attention on why Djibouti has 
opted for this and then follow the logical reason behind it. 
[sentence as heard] 
  [Hazely] Tell me, how difficult has it been for a country 
like Somaliland to pull through to get investment etc., etc., as 
a result of you not being recognized by the world community? 
  [Ateye] Well, indeed, yes, it has been very difficult for us 
to do anything apart from.... [pauses] Because the whole 
infrastructure collapsed, all the institutions have been 
disastrously either demolished or robbed and whatever little 
that we do operate on now is purely on the entrepreneurship and 
the efforts of the local businessmen who are facing very acute 
difficulties in trying to export the livestock which is the 
major earner for dollars and, you know, for...[pauses] revenue 
for the country. And we are suffering. I mean all the aid that 
we receive is mostly through NGO's [nongovernmental 
organizations], which are operating on humanitarian basis and 
all of them would like to operate on an emergency basis. Nobody 
is looking into the long-term [word indistinct] or developmental 
inputs, and this could only come through [word indistinct] camps 
and bilateral.... 
  [Hazely, interrupting] Why should people recognize you, 
anyway? I mean, what have you in Somaliland to offer the 
international community, politically or economically? 
  [Ateye] Well, the reason is.... [pauses] Well, I do agree 
with you if you say what do we have for the world. I mean, we 
are taking care of ourselves. We are trying to develop 
democratically, and we are asking the world community to see us 
here in terms of...[pauses] to be allowed to determine our own 
future. I don't know how to say it. I mean, what will we offer 
the world in terms of recognition and that is.... 
  [Hazely, interrupting] Well, the world is....[pauses] You 
interdepend on each other. I mean you either have to have some 
political support or some economic support or some mineral 
support or natural resources, otherwise they are not going to 
take you--your call for recognition--seriously, are they? 
  [Ateye] Well, I am trying to say today....[pauses] I mean, 
our position is a bit tight, and let us expect that most 
certainly it will not be always like this because our country--I 
mean, there could be resources. We have the fisheries. We have 
reasonable....[pauses] I mean, the studies that have been taking 
place in our country so far before the civil war started, there 
was this reasonable assumption that there is hydrocarbon and 
petroleum deposits over there, and there are also some mineral 
deposits [sentence as heard]. And we could be, I mean, of 
course, contributing to the world and partly playing our part 
if, you know, when we take off. But at the moment, you know, we 
need a bit of development and standing up. 
  [Hazely] Now, you are here in Britain, and, hopefully, you 
say you will be seeing the Overseas Development Ministry 
officials and some officials of the Foreign Affairs Ministry 
here in London. What would be your message to them? 
  [Ateye] We are submitting our proposals for helping us to 
build the institutions of security and peace, to strengthen 
them. I mean, we have resolved it politically, and we have made 
institutions to look after this and fulfill the requirements. 
But what we need is institutional support, and this is what we 
are expecting and asking governments like this government to 
help us build and strengthen these democratic institutions like 
the [words indistinct] police force or demobilization of the 
Army militia or the judicial system and things like this. I 
mean, these are the major aspects we will be looking after.
