<F P=106> [Report on interview with former Japanese Prime Minister </F>
Yasuhiro Nakasone by correspondent Hiroyuki Miyano in London on 
24 February] 
  [Text] London, 24 Feb -- Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro 
Nakasone granted an interview to SANKEI SHIMBUN at a London 
hotel on the morning of 24 February. During the interview, he 
noted that the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] should respond 
flexibly to the future political realignment while considering 
forming an alliance with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] so that 
the party will be able to open the way to recapturing power. 
  Concerning a possible alliance and cooperation between the 
LDP and Shinseito, Nakasone said: "When forming an alliance 
with other parties in the political realignment, the LDP should 
first take into account (the similarity of) basic policies. It 
should allow minor policy differences and join with forces based 
on a general similarity. It should be agreed between alliances 
that any possible obstacles to forging mutual agreements will be 
eliminated." In this way, he noted that the LDP should decide 
whether to form an alliance with Shinseito based on a similarity 
of policies and that the decision should not be affected by 
emotional discord. 
  He also said: "The LDP should deal with the Hosokawa 
government with the principle of being fair and just. It cannot 
take power unless it approaches the government as close as 
possible. Just like in sumo wrestling, the LDP will grab the 
government by the arm and push it out." 
  His remark indicates that at this stage, the LDP needs to 
consider not only forming an alliance with Shinseito but also 
maintaining a position equidistant between Shinseito and other 
forces, such as Sakigake [Harbinger], which have had 
confrontations with Shinseito and Komeito [Clean Government 
Party]. By doing so, it will be able to form an LDP-led 
coalition government, Nakasone suggested. 
  Commenting on similar remarks made by former Foreign 
Minister 
Michio Watanabe on the alliance with Shinseito, Nakasone said, 
"Mr. Watanabe has acted based on the same idea as mine," thus 
giving support to Watanabe.
