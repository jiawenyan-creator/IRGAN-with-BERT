FT  03 JUN 93 / Call for change to tender rules
THE LABOUR party has called on the government to change the rules on
market-testing civil service work to ensure that the quality of public
services does not fall when jobs are put out to tender.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's spokeswoman on the Citizen's Charter, said
yesterday the market-testing programme was 'poorly thought-out, inadequately
tested, monitored and assessed, and not cost-effective'. She added: 'If the
government continues at its present pace, it will have by the end of the
decade emasculated the Civil Service and substituted an infrastructure
incapable of delivering any government policies.'
The market-testing programme was cutting wages and reducing conditions of
work for civil servants, she said, and threatening standards of public
service by ignoring questions of ethics and accountability. She said
companies winning contracts for government work should be required to offer
a minimum wage, protection of pension and basic health and safety
conditions. They should abide by the same anti-discrimination rules as the
Civil Service.
Labour also wants more stringent monitoring of contracted-out work. All
successful bids should be scrutinised by the National Audit Office for cost
and quality.
Ms Mowlam called for clear means of redress for users of public services who
are dissatisfied with contractors' work. Contractors should compensate users
for defects in service.
'Whether or not services should be delivered by the public or private sector
is the wrong question,' she said. 'What is important is that services are of
high quality, are efficiently run, provided by a workforce that is not
exploited and are held accountable for taxpayers' money through elected
politicians.'
