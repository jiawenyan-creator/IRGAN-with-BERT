CHICANOS STILL NEGOTIATING BALLOT SUIT 
Negotiations in the Chicano Federation's election lawsuit against the city of 
San Diego continued Wednesday without discussion of the settlement offered 
Tuesday by the San Diego City Council. 
"There has been no formal offer," said Patricia Meyer, attorney for the Latino 
advocacy group, which is attempting to gain greater political power for 
minorities through the lawsuit. 
'We're Just Talking' 
"Right now, there is no proposal on the table," she added. "We're just talking 
about different avenues and different problems and how things might occur. 
Really and truly, we're just in negotiations." 
Meyer and attorneys for the city met in a settlement conference with U. S. 
Magistrate Harry McCue on Wednesday morning. Deputy City Atty. Ken So said only 
that negotiations are continuing. 
Faced with the possibility that a federal judge might postpone the Sept. 19 
council election as a result of the lawsuit, the council offered to settle the 
suit by giving voters a chance to expand the council from eight to 10 seats in 
a June referendum. 
Meyer, however, virtually rejected that offer the same day, saying it does not 
address the group's other demands, including the creation of an independent 
commission to redraw council district boundaries. That complex and politically 
sensitive process is now handled by the council. 
Lawsuit Updated 
On Monday, U.S. District Judge John S. Rhoades agreed to allow the Chicano 
Federation to amend its lawsuit aimed at altering the city's electoral system. 
Rhoades also scheduled an Aug. 28 hearing on whether he has the authority to 
order the city to place election changes sought by the Chicano Federation on 
the November ballot. 
If Rhoades agrees to do that, the Chicano Federation probably will ask the 
judge to postpone the Sept. 19 council election until June on the grounds that 
the current election system is unconstitutional.
