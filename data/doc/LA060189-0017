SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN FOUND DEAD IN HOME 
Torrance police are investigating the slaying of a 26-year-old woman, who was 
apparently strangled as she moved into her new Park Del Amo townhouse on 
Sepulveda Boulevard. 
The body of Tracy J. Morrigan was discovered by her mother Wednesday morning 
when she arrived at the complex to help her daughter move in. Detectives said 
they have no suspects and no motive in the crime. 
There was no evidence of forced entry, and it was not known how long Morrigan 
had been dead when she was found, said Sgt. Jack McDonald. 
Police said they know little about Morrigan, except that she was not married 
and that her parents, whose name they would not release, are residents of Palos 
Verdes Estates. 
McDonald said the mother told him that Morrigan had just purchased the 
townhouse with money from an inheritance. 
Because of security precautions at the complex, police and residents were 
surprised by the murder, which they said is the first reported violent crime at 
the townhouse and condominium development. Park Del Amo is surrounded by cement 
walls with steel gates and is patrolled by security guards from 4 p.m. to 6 
a.m. 
"People will be cautious for a while," said one resident who preferred 
anonymity. "I'm not going to worry about it."
