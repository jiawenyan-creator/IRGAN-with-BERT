COMMERCIAL SCENE; 
SHERMAN PLAZA COMPLEX COMPLETE 
More than 200 civic and business leaders turned out last week for the official 
opening of Sherman Plaza West, a $30-million, 150,000-square-foot office 
complex at 15400 Sherman Way in Sepulveda. 
The five-story building is the latest in a wave of new commercial projects to 
open in the so-called Sepulveda Corridor. The building is 60% leased, with 
anchor tenants including Hartford Insurance Co., Live Entertainment Inc. and 
Southern California Savings. 
The new structure is the second and final phase of Sherman Plaza. A tree-lined 
courtyard links the building to the four-story, 125,000-square-foot Sherman 
Plaza East office complex that was built as the first phase in 1982. 
Both buildings were developed by Van Nuys-based Nagel Construction Co. The 
Nadel Partnership of Santa Monica designed the two buildings, and Faulkner Co. 
is exclusive leasing agent.
