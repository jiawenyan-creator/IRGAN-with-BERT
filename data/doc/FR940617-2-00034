Nonstandard features of implementations of PHIGS should be used only when the needed operation or function cannot
reasonably be implemented with the standard features alone. Although nonstandard features can be very useful, it
should be recognized that the use of these or any other nonstandard elements may make the interchange of graphics programs
and future conversion more difficult and costly.



10. Specifications.

 American National Standard Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System, ANSI/ISO 9592.1-3:1989 and
ANSI/ISO 9592.1a, 2a, 3a, 4:1992, define the scope of the specifications, the syntax and semantics of the PHIGS elements
and requirements for conforming implementations. All of these specifications apply to Federal Government implementations
of this standard.

ANSI/ISO 9592.103:1989 and ANSI/ISO 9592.1a,2a,3a,4:1992 define a language independent nucleus of a graphics
system for integration into a programming language. Thus, it is embedded in a language layer obeying the particular
conventions of the language. FIPS 153-1 is therefore divided into two parts. Part 1 represents the functional aspects
of PHIGS. Part 1 consists of the following:




(1) Functional description (ANSI/ISO 9592.1:1989) and (ANSI/ISO 9592.1a:1992, Amendment 1)



The functional description of PHIGS provides a set of functions for the definition, display and modification of 2D
or 3D graphical data. It also provides for the definition, display and manipulation of geometrically related objects,
along with the modification of graphics data and the relationships between that graphical data.



(2) Archive file format (ANSI/ISO 9592.2:1989) and (ANSI/ISO 9592.2a:1992, Amendment 1)



The archive file provides a file format suitable for the storage and retrieval of PHIGS structures and structure network
definitions. It allows structure definitions to be stored in an organized way on a graphical software system. And,
facilitates transfer of structure definitions between different graphical software systems.



(3) Clear-text encoding (ANSI/ISO 9592.3:1989) and (ANSI/ISO 9592.3a:1992, Amendment 1)



The clear-text encoding provides a representation of the archive file syntax that is easy to type, edit and read. The
file is human-readable (allows editing), human friendly (easy and natural to read) and machine readable (parsable
by software).



(4) Plus Lumiere and Surfaces, PHIGS PLUS (ANSI/ISO 9592.4:1992)



The Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System (PHIGS) Plus Lumiere and Surfaces (PHIGS PLUS) extends
the basic PHIGS functionality by adding facilities for the specification of curved lines, curved and facetted surfaces,
lighting and other effects such as depth modulation.




Part 2 of FIPS 153-1 consists of the bindings of PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS functions to actual programming languages, defined
in ANSI/ISO 9593:1990. These bindings are developed in cooperation with the voluntary standards committees of the
various languages. The following bindings currently exist, and form part 2 of FIPS 153-1:




_The FORTRAN Language binding for PHIGS (ANSI/ISO 9593.1:1990);
_The ADA Language binding for PHIGS (ANSI/ISO 9593.3:1990);
_The C Language binding for PHIGS (ANSI/ISO 9593.4:1991).




Subsequent language bindings, including those for PHIGS PLUS, will be added periodically as they become available.
As these bindings are approved by ANSI, each language binding will become part of this standard.



11. Implementation.

 Implementation of this standard involves four areas of consideration: the effective date, acquisition of PHIGS
software system implementations, interpretations of PHIGS implementations, and validation of PHIGS implementations.



11.1Effective Date.

 This revised standard is effective six (6) months after approval by the Secretary of Commerce. Requirements for the
use of basic PHIGS functionality (defined in ANSI/ISO 9592.1-3;1989 and ANSI/ISO 9593.1:1990, 9593.3:1990, 9593.4:1991)
are unchanged and continue in effect. Validation of PHIGS implementations is required after the effective date in
accordance with section 11.4.
