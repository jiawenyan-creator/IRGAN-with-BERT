Air France Gets an OK: European Community Competition Commissioner Sir Leon 
Brittan approved the takeover of two French airlines by Air France after 
negotiating a deal to increase industry competition in France. The settlement 
to allow Air France's purchase of UTA and Air Inter, uniting France's biggest 
airlines, would end months of bitter legal wrangling between the commission, 
Air France and the French government.
