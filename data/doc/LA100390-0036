MORNING REPORT: MOVIES 
Terms of Extermination: The Orkin Exterminating Co. is bugged over the product 
placement deal it made with the nation's No. 1 box-office movie this week: 
"Pacific Heights." 
In a breach of contract suit filed in Superior Court in Los Angeles, Orkin said 
that it had agreed to pay $20,000 in a deal to portray the company in a 
favorable light. But "Pacific Heights" represented Orkin as "unwilling or 
unable to perform competent extermination services," the suit said. The 
contract specified that the company would be shown in a "non-disparaging" 
manner. BETH KLEID
