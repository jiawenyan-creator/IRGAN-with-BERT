FT  22 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Japan wants EU to raise car quota
Japan will seek a bigger quota for car and light commercial vehicle exports
to the European Union because of higher than expected demand in Eur-ope,
writes Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent.
Talks between officials of the European Commission and the Japanese Ministry
of International Trade and Industry are to be held in Brussels on September
29 and 30 to review demand forecasts for 1994, according to Miti. In March,
Tokyo and Brussels set a guideline allowing Japanese vehicle exports to the
EU to rise by 0.4 per cent to 984,000 in the whole of 1994.
The agreement was based on a forecast that overall EU demand for cars and
light commercial vehicles would grow by two per cent to 11.97m. In the first
eight months of the year new car sales in the EU rose by an estimated 5.9
per cent to 7.911m according to recent figures from Acea, the European
Automobile Manufacturers Association.
