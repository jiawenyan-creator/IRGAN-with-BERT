 

Finally, in August of 1986, the Department added a final rule implementing section 326(d)(1) of the 1981 HCD Amendments
as a new part 892. This final rule transfers the requirements of 892 to a new part 792, and removes part 892. The rule also
changes the reference from public housing agency (PHA) to housing agency (HA) to recognize definitional changes
resulting from the Indian Housing Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100358). 



II. Other Matters 



A. Environmental Impact 



In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this rule relate only to HUD administrative procedures
and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. 



B. Executive Order 12612, Federalism 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the Federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. Specifically, the rule increases the amount a housing agency may recover
in fraud and abuse cases. As such, the rule will not impinge on the relationship between the Federal and state and local
governments, and the rule is not subject to review under the order. 



C. Executive Order 12606, the Family 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and,
thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result
from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. 



D. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) has reviewed and approved this
rule, and in so doing certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities, because the number of recoveries by housing agencies is expected to be small and so the number of small
public housing agencies affected will be small. In any event, the effect on small entities is expected to be positive
rather than negative. 



E. Paperwork 



The changes made by this final rule to the regulatory text in 24 CFR part 892, which now appears as 24 CFR part 792, will
not add any additional information collection burden than that already approved by the Office of Management and Burden
under the Paperwork Reduction Act and assigned OMB approval number 25770053. 



F. Regulatory Agenda 



This rule was listed as item no. 1655 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October 25,
1993 (58 FR 56402, 56453) in accordance with Executive Order 12991 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 



G. Justification for Final Rulemaking 



In general, the Department publishes rules for public comment before their issuance for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 provides exceptions from that general rule where
the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied
when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest'' (24 CFR 10.1).
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without first soliciting public comment,
in that prior public procedure is unnecessary because the changes being made to part 892, which now appears as part
792, merely implement statutory amendments that do not involve the exercise of any discretion by the Department.
