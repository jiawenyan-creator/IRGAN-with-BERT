B OF A SUED BY TOP FIRM IN STUDENT LOANS 
First Independent Trust Co. of Sacramento filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit 
Thursday against Bank of America and the California Student Loan Finance Corp. 
alleging that they broke agreements to buy student loans. 
The lawsuit filed in Sacramento County Superior Court seeks $73 million in 
compensatory damages and unspecified punitive damages for fraud, breach of 
contract and interference with economic relations. 
First Independent was one of the nation's largest lenders of guaranteed student 
loans until it stopped making new loans earlier this week, saying financing for 
some of the riskier loans had dried up. 
At the time First Independent announced its decision, however, it had been put 
on notice by state student-loan officials that it was about to be banned from 
making loans in California for widespread and continuing violations of 
student-loan program rules -- including failure to pay $4.5 million in fees 
owed to the federal government. 
In addition, its largest guarantor, the nonprofit Higher Education Assistance 
Foundation in Minnesota, also has told the company that it will stop 
guaranteeing student loans it makes because of the alleged violations. 
State's Largest Such Lender 
Since 1980, First Independent has been one of the nation's most aggressive 
lenders in the student-loan business, making $1.5 billion in loans. Many were 
risky loans to students in vocational schools, who student-loan officials say 
have a default rate of from 30% to 40% nationally. 
It has been the state's largest student-loan lender over the past three years. 
During the past academic year, First Independent Trust Co. made $739 million in 
student loans to 295,000 students attending 1,500 schools in California and 43 
other states.
