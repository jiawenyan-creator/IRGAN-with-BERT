FT  10 MAY 91 / International Company News: Disney unveils Dollars 3bn
resort scheme
THE EXPANSION plans of Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, took on a
new dimension this week when the company unveiled a preliminary 'master
plan' for a Dollars 3bn resort next to its existing Disneyland centre in
Anaheim, Los Angeles, writes Nikki Tait.
The plan envisages a theme park - the Westcot Center - located on the
current Disneyland parking lot.
This would, in 'Disneyspeak', 'provide dramatic showcases of foreign lands
and themed pavilions that explore the wonders of the human body, our natural
environment and the universe beyond.'
Disney also suggests building three new hotels as part of the 470-acre
resort, together with a six-acre man-made lake, and an array of retail and
dining outlets.
However, it will not make any decision on whether to press ahead with the
scheme until the end of the year. It released plans last year to build a
Dollars 2bn project - a cross between a theme park, a water park and a
resort - at Long Beach, about 15 miles away, but, even then, it was known to
be considering the Anaheim site as another possibility.
As a result, there have been suggestions Disney is effectively creating
rivalry between two areas to attract its custom, although the possibility
that the company would build at both locations has also been mooted.
Disney said only that it was 'excited by the potential of each project' and
was doing feasibility work at both sites.
The decision would depend on 'several factors, including continued creative
development by Disney, government approvals and support, theme park and
resort economics and community support'.
