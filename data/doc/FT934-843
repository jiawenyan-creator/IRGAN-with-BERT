FT  22 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Buy cocoa now' German
processors told
The German cocoa buyers' umbrella organisation Kakao-Einkaufs-Gesellschaft
is encouraging processors to take advantage of cheap cocoa following the
recent price slump, reports Reuter from Hamburg.
In a report the organisation noted that the March futures price at the
London Commodity Exchange had fallen Pounds 166 in just two weeks, to touch
Pounds 900 a tonne on Monday.
'An average price of DM240 per 100 kilograms, net, cif Hamburg for
January/December 1994 shipment offers a good chance to cover some missed
requirements,' it said.
KEG explained that the political situation in the Ivory Coast had settled
down, following the death of president Felix Houphouet-Boigny, taking a
bullish element out of the market.
