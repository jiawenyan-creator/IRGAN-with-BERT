  [Text] Armenia's parliament has called for international 
condemnation of what it has described as military action against 
civilians and for international measures to prevent such action 
in the future. 
  In a statement published in Yerevan on Monday evening, 
following an Azerbaijani air raid on the Nagorno-Karabakh 
capital Stepanakert which killed three and injured nine people, 
the Armenian legislature appealed to the United Nations, the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European 
Parliament, the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, and the 
parliaments of all countries to "most adamently" condemn 
Azerbaijan's military action against civilians and "take urgent 
measures, based on international law, to prevent future air 
raids on populated areas." 
  "By such barbarous acts, Azerbaijan is again proving that it 
has not abandoned its official policy of terrorism against the 
people of Nagorno-Karabakh, the aim of which is to annihilate 
the civilian population," the parliament said.
