FT  07 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: S&amp;N
It may be as much a matter of luck as judgement, but Scottish &amp; Newcastle is
well positioned in the beer market. Its strength in Scotland and the north
of England leaves it less affected by the recession than southern brewers
like Whitbread. It has had fewer problems than most in complying with
Government mandated changes in the brewing industry. A strong position in
the free trade and emphasis on premium brands confined its volume fall to 1
per cent in 1991-92, compared with an overall market drop of 5 per cent.
Still, S&amp;N has barely outperformed the sector over the past year. Part of
the reason may be that a strong performance - annual operating profits grew
by 6 per cent - was already in the price. A historic multiple of nearly 13
puts S&amp;N on a higher rating than either Bass or Whitbread. Then again, S&amp;N
arguably lacks the critical mass to enjoy a secure position in the big
league, while Bass can probably still wring more margin from efficiency
gains.
If the drinking population has become more discerning with age, it is also
drinking less. That sets a limit on the benefits S&amp;N can reap from a
consumer switch to premium brands. Without the leisure division, operating
profits would have grown by a mere 3 per cent. But its Center Parcs are both
expensive to develop and vulnerable to any slowdown in northern Europe
prompted by the German monetary squeeze. The trouble with S&amp;N is that it
falls between two stools. It is not quite a growth stock, but it is not a
cyclical one either.
