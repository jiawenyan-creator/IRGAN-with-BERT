REPUBLIC OF YEMEN 
THE LAND -- Yemen spans 203,645 square miles on the southwestern edge of the 
Arabian Peninsula and has borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman. The country 
controls the Bab al Mandab strait, strategic gateway to the Red Sea. 
THE PEOPLE -- Yemen has 11 million people. They are mainly tribal, and the main 
religion is Sunni Islam. 
THE ECONOMY -- Yemen is among the poorest nations in the world, but newly 
discovered oil reserves could change that. Unofficial estimates say the 
reserves could amount to as much as 2 billion barrels. 
Money from millions of Yemenis working outside their country, mainly in the 
oil-rich Persian Gulf, and from foreign aid helped prop up the economy of the 
pro-Western north for years. Farming is the main activity and crops include 
wheat, sorghum, coffee, tobacco and cotton. 
HISTORY -- By merging, the north and south regained their former status as part 
of ancient Arabia and the kingdom of Sheba that lasted for 800 years until the 
2nd Century BC. 
For the next 800 years it was ruled by the Himyarites, one of the earliest Arab 
tribes, then by Ethiopians and Persians until Islam arrived in the 7th Century. 
In 1517 South Yemen became part of the Ottoman Empire. Britain seized Aden in 
1839, and the surrounding territory later became a British protectorate. 
Aden won independence in 1967 after a terrorist campaign, and South Yemen 
became the Arab world's only Marxist state. 
The northern country was established in 1962 after an Egyptian-backed 
revolution ousted the Saudi Arabian-backed imam.
