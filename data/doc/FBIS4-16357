  [Text] Moscow, 15 Apr -- A group of eight Ukrainian naval 
personnel, having enlisted the support of the Ukrainian 
president's representative in Izmail, today arrived at the Black 
Sea Fleet's brigade of river cutters. The group was headed by 
Captain, First Rank, Dmitriy Ukrainets, head of the western area 
of the Ukrainian Navy's Water Protection Force, the report from 
the Black Sea Fleet's press center says. 
  Those who arrived there met with the unit's command and 
handed over a directive from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, 
dated 10 April 1994, stating that the Black Sea Fleet unit is 
disbanded and on its basis is created the Third Brigade for the 
Ukrainian Navy's Water Protection Force. 
  The Ukrainian Navy representatives called on the brigade's 
command not to use weapons. The Ukrainian side said that those 
servicemen who wish to serve in the Navy of the Russian 
Federation will be allowed to leave for Russia. 
  Thus, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry is not giving up its 
attempts to use force to resubordinate units of the Black Sea 
Fleet, crudely violating all the Russian-Ukrainian accords which 
have been reached concerning the Fleet, the Black Sea Fleet 
press center's report says.
