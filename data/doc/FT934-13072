FT  23 OCT 93 / Egypt braced for big drop in tourism
EGYPT'S travel trade is braced for another disastrous winter season, with
the latest tourism ministry figures showing a 31 per cent fall in tourist
nights for the first eight months of 1993 and hoteliers reporting occupancy
rates limping along at 20 per cent in the country's traditional Nile
resorts.
Ministry figures show the number of European visitors fell 25 per cent
between January and August 1993 against the same period last year, with
total arrivals down 20 per cent at 1.7m over the period.
Worse, hotel managers and booking agencies report no pick-up as the peak
winter season for European visitors begins. 'The winter's already over for
us,' said the manager of one five-star Cairo hotel, which has forward
bookings only for 20 per cent of the rooms over the next fortnight.
The continued slump in one of Egypt's main foreign exchange earning
industries - it culled an officially estimated Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) in
1991/92 - is blamed on the effect of Islamic extremist attacks on tourist
targets.
These have abated significantly in the past four months, mainly because of
intensified security operations. But officials in the industry say the real
effect of these attacks will be felt this year, since many international
travel agencies dropped Egyptian packages from this season's brochures.
Packages to Cairo and the main Nile resorts in Upper Egypt, Aswan and Luxor
have borne the brunt. The Hilton group reports that occupancy in Upper Egypt
hotels is just 20 per cent, while it is operating just one of its three Nile
cruisers. Individual rates on Nile cruises have been halved as a result to
around Dollars 400 for a week's cruise.
'We haven't even created group rates for the winter season, because we don't
get groups any more,' said leading cruise operator bleakly.
