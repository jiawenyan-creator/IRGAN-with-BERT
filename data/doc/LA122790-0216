P.M. BRIEFING; 
INDIANA TRASH LAW RULED DOWN 
A federal judge today ruled that provisions of Indiana's new law regulating 
out-of-state trash are unconstitutional, saying the flow of rubbish into the 
state is all part of commerce. 
U.S. District Judge John D. Tinder concluded that the law's three key 
provisions violate the Constitution's commerce clause that allows free trade 
among the states. 
"However noble and popular these three provisions of House Enrolled Act 1240 
appear to be, they must give way to the constitutional principles," Tinder 
wrote. The same protection that the commerce clause gives to the citizens of 
other states who feel the need to (export) waste into Indiana protects Indiana 
citizens when they export hazardous waste to other states. "Commerce, even in 
such 'bads' as waste, is a two-way street," he wrote.
