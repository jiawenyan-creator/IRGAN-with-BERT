  [Text] Negotiators from Taiwan and Mainland China 
Wednesday [30 March] ended their current round of talks in 
Peking without an agreement. Taiwan's chief negotiator Hsu 
Hui-yu and his mainland counterpart Sun Ya-fu [Sun Yafu] both 
expressed regrets as soon as they ended the talks. The talks 
were the fourth effort since last April to settle technical 
issues between the two sides. 
  Sun said: Although the results were predictable, the two 
sides did improve mutual understanding. Hsu and Sun all agreed 
that the next round of talks should be held as soon as possible 
to solve the problems at hand. 
  The Peking talks, which began last Friday, were originally 
expected to conclude agreements on repatriation of mainland 
hijackers and illegal immigrants, and resolve cross-strait 
fishing disputes. Taiwan wants the rights to exclude some 
hijackers from repatriation if it is determined they have their 
political or religious motives. Peking has said Taiwan does not 
have the legal rights to make such a decision.
