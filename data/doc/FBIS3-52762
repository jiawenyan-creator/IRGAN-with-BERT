  [Text] The LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] has 
confirmed that its former deputy leader Gopalaswamy 
Mahendraraja, alias Mahattaya, has been sentenced to death. 
According to early intelligence reports, his execution has been 
tentatively fixed for the 16th of this month. A news dispatch 
received by LANKAPUVATH from London states that this week's 
edition of the official LTTE news bulletin (KHALLATATHIL) 
published in London announced that Mahattaya has been sentenced 
to death. He is also a former leader of the political wing of 
the terrorist group. Mahattaya is reported to be held in an 
LTTE prison in Jaffna. 
  The main accusation against him is that he has served as an 
agent of India's Research and Analysis Wing and allegedly 
provided vital information which led to the Indian Navy 
apprehending the MV Ahatta on board [as heard] which LTTE's 
international representative and former deputy leader Sadasivam 
Krishnakumar, alias Kittu, was transporting a shipload of highly 
sophisticated weapons for use by the LTTE.
