<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Leshkevich: "Belarus `Cleans Up' </F>
Legislation"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] During its session yesterday, 
the Belarusian Supreme Soviet also adopted a number of 
resolutions which bring Belarusian legislation in line with that 
of Russia, as is required by provisions of the monetary merger 
agreement between the two states. In particular, the law "On 
Export and Import Tax" was abolished; from 1 May 1994 to 1 
January 1996 (until the expiration of Russia's customs tariff on 
exports), a temporary customs tariff is being introduced. 
Changes were also introduced to legislative acts concerning 
taxation. In the first place, they concern tax policy toward 
facilities used by Russian strategic troops deployed on 
Belarusian soil.
