ALLA BREVE 
WEILL: "Die Dreigroschenoper." Ute Lemper, Milva, Helga Dernesch, Rene Kollo, 
Mario Adorf, Rolf Boysen; RIAS Chamber Choir and RIAS Berlin Sinfonietta 
conducted by John Mauceri. 
London 430 075. The second release in London's Weill project should satisfy 
both those who believe the composer belongs in the opera house and those who 
would consign him to the musical theater. Boysen's Ballad Singer sounds smarmy 
and slightly indecent. Dernesch's formidable mezzo relishes the Brecht text in 
the "Ballad of Sexual Obsession." Kollo's Macheath lends just the right note of 
skewed gallantry. Lemper's Polly (this version restores her the "Pirate Jenny" 
number) is insidiously demure, while Milva is a ferocious Jenny. Mauceri keeps 
sentimentality at bay while sticking with the printed score. Spoken passages 
are abridged; some verses are eliminated in order to fit "Threepenny Opera" 
onto one compact disc, but this is generally a performance that sizzles. Allan
