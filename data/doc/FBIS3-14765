  [Text] Moscow, 25 Feb -- Three Russian Army servicemen were 
attacked in Riga today by unknown assailants and were taken to 
military hospital in a serious condition. An ITAR-TASS 
correspondent learned from military sources in the Latvian 
capital that the three servicemen on leave from the Riga 
garrison -- a sergeant and two privates -- were badly beaten up. 
Two of the servicemen have concussion and the one of the 
privates was stabbed in the abdomen. 
  The command of the Russian troops in the Baltics has 
appealed 
to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the republic to take 
measures to investigate the incident. 
  Under Russian legislation, in this case the law-enforcement 
bodies of Latvia should launch criminal proceedings and carry 
out an investigation.
