  [Text] [110735] [Peslyak over video of Japanese, 
Moscow street scenes, Vladivostok harbor including warships and 
port installations] We are very grateful to Japan for its 
offer to cooperate in nuclear ecology, I was told by a ranking 
official of the Russian Foreign Ministry. Unfortunately, the 
inspection of a Japanese tanker has revealed that it cannot be 
used to store liquid nuclear waste safely. And secondly, we 
fill up one tanker, and then what? So the main burden will have 
to be borne by our own resources. A Russian vessel, the 
``Pinega,'' which can take 1,000 cubic meters of liquid waste, 
has been found in the Vladivostok area. There is also a system 
for processing this waste. Allow me to remind you that 
``Vesti'' has already reported on our technologies for 
processing liquid waste from nuclear-powered vessels in the 
North. Now a similar enterprise is being built in the Far East. 
Thanks to Japanese credit, it has to be admitted. Coping with 
nuclear waste single-handedly is expensive and difficult. We 
were told at the Foreign Ministry that in the spring a Russian 
research vessel, together with Japanese and South Korean 
experts, will be studying possible dumping grounds for solid 
nuclear waste in the depths of the Pacific. This means that 
clean, economical, and long-term solutions to dirty problems can 
be found by pooling efforts. [110842] [video shows
