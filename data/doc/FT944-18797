FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Now you pay more to insure
Protecting your assets becomes more expensive this weekend, with the new
insurance premium tax of 2.5 per cent coming into force today.
It will be noticed most by motorists and those buying buildings and home
contents cover, but it applies to all general policies including travel
insurance and the employment protection cover often sold in conjunction with
loans and credit cards.
It also includes contracts which may not normally be thought of as
insurance, such as extended warranties on electrical goods and membership of
breakdown recovery services like the AA and RAC.
While tax does not apply to long-term products, like life insurance or most
kinds of permanent health insurance, it will hit private medical insurance.
A handful of insurers - including the Prudential and Pearl - have announced
they will absorb the cost rather than pass it on to their customers. But
this could be short-lived: no insurer has committed itself to absorbing the
tax for more than the first year and some people in the industry fear it
could be increased in next month's Budget.
In other EC countries, the tax can be as high as 30 per cent on some types
of insurance, although a more normal level is 5 to 10 per cent.
Research by AA Insurance has found that UK motor insurance premiums rose on
average by less than 0.5 per cent between July and October, rather than at
least 2.5 per cent, as might have been expected. So, although most insurers
are passing on the cost of the tax, underlying premiums are falling for
other reasons - which almost cancels out the effect of the new levy.
