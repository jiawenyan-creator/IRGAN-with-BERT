FT  26 JUN 93 / The Property Market: Now you see it, now you don't -
Cadogan's Place
THE MAY Corporate Estate Agents' property index reveals a rise of 4.1 per
cent in sales for May compared with May 1992, but a 3.4 per cent fall on
April. Contracts exchanged rose marginally from April but instructions to
sell were down.
March has been the best month for them in 1993. Does this signal a decline
in confidence, as spring promise turned to summer rains with the government
and prime minister stuck in the mud?
News of actual sales and of prices asked continues to be mixed, as you might
expect in a stabilising market. Chesterfield sold 59 Chester Square, London
SW1, with a 57-year lease and a ground rent of Pounds 1,700, for the asking
price of Pounds 1.65m before the brochure was circulated.
Most agents report continued overseas interest in London properties. Even a
Russian has bought a flat in Berkeley House, Hay Hill, London W1, for close
to the guide price of Pounds 775,000 (down from Pounds 1m two years ago)
through Lassmans. In the country, Strutt &amp; Parker in Salisbury, Wilts, sold
The Moot House in Downton near its Pounds 650,000 guide price.
Savills' country department reports selling 10 major properties in May with
a value approaching Pounds 11m, including three sales where terms were
agreed and contracts exchanged within 48 hours. Prices, the firm believes,
were 10-15 per cent higher than in August 1992, and two fifths of the buyers
were from abroad.
On the other hand some asking prices continue downwards. Carscombe, a 17th
century house at Stoodleigh near Tiverton in Devon which was a safe house
for the Cavaliers during the Civil War, stood unsold for a year at Pounds
425,000. It is now re-priced at Pounds 325,000 for the house with six
bedrooms, five bathrooms, a swimming pool and 20 acres, from Jackson-Stops
in Exeter (0392-214 222) and Lane Fox in Tiverton (0884-242468).
Similarly Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Exeter (0392-433 033) offers the
Northmoor estate on Exmoor, on sale now for the second time in two years, at
a total guide price for the lots of Pounds 560,000, which is 25 per cent
down on last time. And Telham Hill House near Battle, in East Sussex, is
reduced by Pounds 115,000 to offers over Pounds 300,000 from Strutt &amp; Parker
in Lewes (0273-475 411).
The largest recent reduction is a curio of history: the fortress called No
Man's Land in the middle of the Solent, built to counter a possible threat
from France under Napoleon III with 49 guns and 400 men. It took 20 years to
finish. Gladstone was opposed to it being built when he was chancellor
because of the cost, which led Queen Victoria to say: 'Better to lose
Gladstone than to lose Portsmouth.' Three years ago it was on offer at
Pounds 5.75m, after being, rebuilt as a luxurious abode. Last year, it came
down to Pounds 2.5m. Now, it is Pounds 950,000. Call Knight Frank &amp; Rutley
(071-629-8171) for the ultimate in offshore island getaways, with three
helicopter pads. If no buyer appears, it will be sold by informal tender on
September 10.
For pricing normal properties the moral is that the guide price must be
realistic, not greedy; then, a good place will sell quickly. There is a
danger that vendors will wait too long in the hope of getting more. They may
find that sentiment has turned down by the time they have nerved themselves
to enter the market.
Selling your house without an agent is unusual but Virginia Pryor is doing
it with Lady's Cottage at Melton Constable, in north Norfolk. It has five
bedrooms, three bathrooms, an annexe/granny flat/holiday cottage and 72
acres of woods. Locals say DH Lawrence used to stay nearby and found the
cottage hidden in the woods with a gamekeeper living in it, which partly
gave him the idea for Lady Chatterley's Lover. The guide price is Pounds
445,000. Inquiries to 0263-860 980.
