MAILMAN GETS NEW ADDRESS: PRISON 
A former mail carrier whose home was stacked with tons of undelivered junk mail 
was sentenced today to a year and a day in federal prison for failing to 
deliver two first-class letters. 
William Ryan, 59, told the court that he felt he couldn't deliver all the mail 
assigned to him on his rural route and started leaving a few pieces in his car 
every day about three years ago. "Things just seemed to snowball," Ryan told 
U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson. 
The first-class letters were discovered among nearly 500,000 pieces of mostly 
advertising brochures, catalogues, sweepstakes offers, give-aways and other 
so-called junk mail found heaped in and around his home last August by 
authorities following up on a tip.
