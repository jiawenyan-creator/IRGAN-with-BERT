WEEKEND TV; 
IRAQI INVASION OF KUWAIT DOMINATES NEWS SHOWS 
Public-affairs programs this weekend will be filled with sobering discussions 
of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and what the rest of the world can do about it. 
But some entertaining relief is in store Sunday night. 
Fresh off 14 Emmy nominations, the two-hour pilot of "Twin Peaks," directed by 
David Lynch, repeats Sunday at 9 p.m. on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42. If you 
missed it the first time around, now's your chance to see what all the hoopla 
is about. The darkly funny mystery stars Emmy-nominees Kyle MacLachlan, Piper 
Laurie, Sherilyn Fenn and dozens more. 
If you didn't get enough of Madonna when she was in town a few months ago, HBO 
presents "Madonna -- Live! Blond Ambition World Tour '90" at 9 p.m. Sunday. The 
song-and-dance extravaganza, scheduled to be broadcast from Nice, France, marks 
the pop vixen's first in-concert TV performance. 
Also Sunday at 9 p.m. on Channels 4, 36, 39, Jeff Fahey stars in "Parker Kane," 
a failed pilot about a zany cop who sets up a private-eye business out of a 
Long Beach diner. 
And since we all will have to wait at least two more months for a new episode 
of "The Simpsons," Sunday's rerun about daughter Lisa's addiction to the blues, 
8:30 p.m. (11)(6), stands as one of the Emmy-nominated series' most thoughtful 
installments.
