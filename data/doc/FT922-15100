FT  02 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Large placing in United
THE BIGGEST single deal of the day was in United Newspapers, which saw
17.25m shares placed as Canadian publisher Mr Conrad Black sold his entire
stake in the group.
Mr Black offloaded his 8.7 per cent holding through securities houses Smith
New Court and Cazenove. The Seaq electronic trading revealed two large
blocks of shares dealt at 346p, and a large number of trades carried out at
350p.
Smith said the shares were sold to around 30 different institutions at 350p
apiece in a bought deal. This involves a broker buying shares and taking the
risk of having them on its books rather than merely acting as an
intermediary.
United closed 13 off at 360p and was the most heavily traded stock in
London; the recorded volume of 39.6m shares accounts for both sides of the
Smith deal.
Analysts believe Mr Black has made a loss of between Pounds 15m and Pounds
18.6m on his holding. After the markets closed there were reports suggesting
that Mr Black was also seeking to raise money through a public listing and
sale of some 20m shares in the Daily Telegraph, his UK newspaper.
Tomkins shines
Speculation that conglomerate Tomkins is about to purchase the industrial
division of mining group RTZ was among the factors that helped the shares
stand out as the best FT-SE performer of the session.
The shares gained 8 to 440p, also powered by a buy recommendation from
County NatWest. Mr Geoff Allum at County pointed out that '75 per cent of
the company's earnings come from the US, and the UK businesses are not
overly sensitive to a Labour government and indeed some may benefit'.
Tomkins is still thought to be eyeing Racal Electronics, down  3/4 at 55 1/2
p, as a bid target with, it is thought, Chubb, Racal's security, locks and
alarms subsidiary, as the ultimate prize.
Several stocks were wanted for their large overseas exposure, as a guard
against a Labour party victory. RTZ added 5 at 579p, BAT Industries 6 at
679p and BOC 5 at 657p. Grand Metropolitan ended 7 better at 887p after the
company's managing director spoke of an upturn in the US economy which is
feeding through to benefit its Burger King chain.
Utilities hit
There appeared to be no doubt in the public utilities sector about Mr Neil
Kinnock's claim that he is on course for Downing Street as head of a
majority Labour government. Utilities are very vulnerable to the political
climate and will continue to move with the opinion polls in the run-up to
next week's election, according to dealers.
London Electricity fell 27 to 222p, with Manweb losing 24 to 257p, partly on
fears that a Labour government would be more severe in regulating profits of
the regional companies.
Among the power generators, National Power gave up 4 1/2 to 191p and
PowerGen slipped 5 to 200p, on turnover of around 3m shares each. Fears that
Labour will make the generating companies buy expensive British coal weighed
on the stocks. Scottish Power dropped 8 1/2 to 80 1/2 p and Scottish
Hydro-Electric 7 to 83p in spite of comments by analysts that the Scottish
power companies are less likely to be affected by any new regulatory
controls. The Electricity Package retreated 200 to Pounds 2288.
Views that Labour will be bad for utilities was also reflected in the water
shares. Thames and Wessex each lost 10 to 335p and 383p respectively, while
Seven Trent fell 9 to 310p.
Lower forecasts from bearish Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull contributed
to weakness in BP, which fell 6 to 249p on heavy turnover of 15.3m shares.
Strauss took a more cautious view on the prospects for Colombia's Cusiana
oilfield in which BP has a large stake. The house reduced its estimate for
first-quarter net income from Pounds 117m to Pounds 31m and its full-year
1992 forecast by Pounds 200m to Pounds 500m. Strauss also argued that a
dividend cut would come earlier than previously expected.
Oil company Lasmo held up relatively well in spite of the effects of a large
placing at well below the middle price yesterday. Smith New Court took on a
block of nearly 4m shares from one institution at 172p a share and placed
them with a number of institutions at 175p. This follows a similar deal in
Lasmo, conducted by the securities house, just over a month ago. Lasmo
closed 10 down at 185p.
County NatWest became the latest broker to warn that property groups with
exposure to the central London office market and the south-east retail
sector would be hardest hit by a Labour government.
Yesterday there were widespread falls across the whole sector, with Brixton
Estates adrift 9 at 149p, Hammerson ordinary 31 at 411p and MEPC 11 at 295p.
Chemicals company MTM fell sharply after the group said it had breached
banking covenants and did not expect to be able to pay a dividend for 1991.
The shares plummeted 40 to 26p with 3m traded.
Mr Howard Klein, chairman of Owners Abroad, made Pounds 724,500 in the
market on Monday, it was revealed, when he exercised options on shares at a
price of 3p apiece and sold them for 108p. Yesterday, Owners Abroad weakened
with the market, falling 5 1/2 to 99 1/2 p.
Heavy trade in Forte of 5.6m left the hotel group off 10 at 226p as some
dealers felt the stock's rise had been overdone.
Conglomerate Hanson receded 4 to 211 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 17.5m
shares, although US investors remained keen.
Rothmans International 'B' dipped 5 to 1014p as it was announced that
Australia had banned tobacco sponsorship of sporting events.
