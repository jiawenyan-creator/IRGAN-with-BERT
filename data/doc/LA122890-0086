EXPULSION OF FOUR PALESTINIANS BARRED 
The Israeli Supreme Court temporarily barred the expulsion of four Palestinians 
suspected of being leaders of the Muslim fundamentalist Hamas movement in the 
occupied territories. Lawyers for the four, from the Gaza Strip, had argued 
that the expulsions would violate the Fourth Geneva Convention on treatment of 
prisoners under occupation. The expulsions will be delayed until the court 
completes its deliberations.
