P.M. BRIEFING; 
SHEARSON LEHMAN INC. INDICTED 
A grand jury today indicted Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. and two former 
employees on securities fraud charges stemming from millions of dollars in 
customer losses in the stock market crash of 1987. 
In addition to the corporation, the 42 indictments handed up by a Cuyahoga 
County grand jury named Sheldon Strauss, a former account executive at 
Shearson's Cleveland office, and Stephen Weinberg, the former office manager. 
Strauss was charged with fraud and false representations in the sale of 
securities, and Weinberg and the corporation were charged with complicity in 
Strauss's actions. 
A spokesman for the Ohio Division of Securities, which investigated the case, 
said Shearson Lehman has already settled more than $4.9-million worth of claims 
from Strauss's former clients, many of whom suffered extensive losses on "Black 
Monday," Oct. 19, 1987.
