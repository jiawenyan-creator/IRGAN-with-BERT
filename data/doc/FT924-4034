FT  04 DEC 92 / Rise in schemes linked to profit
THE NUMBER of profit-related pay schemes more than doubled in the past year,
according to Inland Revenue figures released yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
Live schemes rose to 3,268, resulting in a doubling of the number of
employees covered to 780,600. The Revenue said that reflected an increase in
the tax-free limits in last year's Budget.
