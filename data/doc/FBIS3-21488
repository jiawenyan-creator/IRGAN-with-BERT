  [Text] If pest control is not performed properly, damage 
caused to the wheat crop may be equivalent to a 1.5-million-ton 
loss--equivalent to a shortage of bread to 5 million people per 
year. 
  The head of the Organization of Plant Protection, Dr. Ahmad 
Rasipur, in a conversation with a correspondent of IRNA, said: 
With the use of government credits, during the current 
agricultural year 2 million hectares[ha] of land were treated 
against aphids, locusts, field mice, potato beetles, and other 
crop pests. 
  Dr. Ahmad Rasipur explained that untimely pest control will 
cause the loss of millions of tons of crops, worth billions of 
rials economically, which will in the long run bring about more 
dependency to the country. 
  He added: During the current agricultural year, 260,000 ha 
of 
farm land have been treated against locusts, 500,000 ha against 
field mice, 893,000 ha against aphids, 40,000 ha against 
Colorado potato beetles, and against other pests. 
  According to him, during the current year, about 1 million 
ha 
of farm land have been treated against grain weeds. This 
success, which is a part of the expansion of the pivotal plan 
for production of wheat in the country, is indebted to the 
Organization of Plant Protection. 
  Referring to the conference on locusts in the eastern region 
of southwest Asia to be held in the current month--on 5 February 
1994 in Tehran, he said: heads of organizations of plant 
protection from Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, and Iran, with the 
U.N. Organization of Food and Agriculture, will participate in 
the conference. 
  Rasipur added: Currently our country is in a state of 
readiness to combat locusts in the province of Sistan va 
Baluchestan. With our specialized human force, and the use of 
pesticide and other facilities, we will launch our campaign 
against locusts whenever necessary.
