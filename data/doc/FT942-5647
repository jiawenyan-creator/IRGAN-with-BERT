FT  03 JUN 94 / Observer: Gumming up the works
John Gummer clearly has a lot on his plate at the moment. The UK environment
secretary's name appears on many people's lists for demotion in the expected
summer cabinet reshuffle; for such a long-serving stalwart of successive
Tory administrations, that prospect must concentrate the mind.
Enough, perhaps, to justify his 45-minute-late arrival on Wednesday evening
at a bash organised by London First, the business-led organisation to
promote Britain's capital.
Sir Terence Conran, Stuart Hampson of the John Lewis Partnership and Sir
Brian Jenkins of Coopers &amp; Lybrand were among 100 guests of Christopher
Moran - the former insurance broker expelled from Lloyd's 12 years ago - at
a dinner to raise awareness of London's 'intrinsic and enduring qualities'.
Gummer chose to pick a fight with Sir Richard Rogers who, in his speech,
delivered some home truths on the government's shortcomings over London.
The environment secretary took exception to Britain's leading architect
pointing out that London's docklands was only 60 per cent completed after 15
years of regeneration. Nor did he much care for Rogers reminding the
assembly that no other European capital has a large urban development that
is inaccessible by public transport at the weekends.
Time for a new portfolio. Minister for cleansing the streets of beggars
looks a possibility . . .
