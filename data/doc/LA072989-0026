JAZZ REVIEWS; 
JIMMY AND STACY ROWLES MAKE MUSIC A FAMILY AFFAIR 
Jazz fans who can bear the echoing din of Linda's, a loft-like eatery on 
trend-stricken Melrose Avenue, have a special treat in store for them on 
Thursday nights when the father-daughter team of Jimmy and Stacy Rowles hold 
court. 
Aided by substitute bassist Larry Gales and joined briefly by the club's owner, 
singer Linda Keegan, the two Rowleses matched wits and chops in a pair of 
too-short sets Thursday evening that were simply divine. 
"Birk's Works," a tune by Dizzy Gillespie, got things going in an easily 
swinging tempo that provided an apt backdrop for Stacy's understated 
fluegelhorn. Gales, as he would on a couple of occasions, soloed deftly by bow, 
with the elder Rowles gently accenting the proceedings with his poignant 
glimpses of melody. 
"Prelude to a Kiss," from the Ellington songbook, had the pianist working the 
ballad with only bass accompaniment. Though slowly paced, Jimmy implied 
tremendous melodic movement, his uniquely voiced harmonies supplying 
exceptional interest to the tune. 
"Local Motif," a tune by bassist Gales, was an oddly rhythmic piece whose muted 
trumpet lines by Stacy lent a '50s Miles Davis feeling. 
But the young trumpeter is hardly a clone of Davis or any other figure in jazz. 
She has, in recent years, clearly come into her own. Possessing fine chops and 
extraordinary sensibilities (is it genetic?), she lent spirit, grace and beauty 
to each of her outings. None, however, was better than her reading of "Old 
Folks," a gentle ballad in which daughter and father shone. 
On the swing side, her muted trumpet work on "All the Things You Are" was 
lively and inventive. 
Thursdays at Linda's are a must for jazz fans. Go early (the sets begin at 8 
p.m.) and sit close to the piano.A. JAMES LISKA
