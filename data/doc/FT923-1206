FT  24 SEP 92 / Concern for care of elderly
MR HERBERT LAMING, chief inspector of the social services inspectorate,
added his weight yesterday to growing concern about councils' lack of
readiness to shift care of the elderly and disabled into the community.
Presenting the inspectorate's first annual report, Mr Laming said he judged
that enough would have been done by next April to make the change work.
Nevertheless it would be some time before the full range of activities
planned for care in the community would be in place. He warned that most
local authorities 'have a great deal of hard work still to do, and a number
are seriously behind the timetable'. Monitoring exercises were planned to
identify those lagging behind and direct additional help to them.
Mr Laming reported that the inspectorate was strengthening its checking
after a series of scandals over the management of residential children's
homes. Proposals to involve lay people in the inspection process would soon
be published.
The inspectorate has been working with the national training council for
social workers to help unqualified heads of local-authority children's homes
to achieve a professional qualification.
