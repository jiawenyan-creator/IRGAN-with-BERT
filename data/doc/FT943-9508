FT  11 AUG 94 / UN threatens more air strikes
The United Nations threatened to call in air strikes yesterday on both Serb
and Bosnian positions for exchanging artillery fire within the weapons
exclusion zone around Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. UN commander Lt Gen Sir
Michael Rose accused both sides of 'serious breaches' and estimated that 400
artillery shells and mortar rounds had landed within and just outside the
zone. UN officials say Moslem-led government forces fired into the
12-mile-wide zone from the north while Serb gunners returned fire from
within the zone, aiming at Bosnian-held Visoko and other targets. This is
the first time the Bosnian government has been warned since the zone was set
up this spring. Its forces have become more assertive since Belgrade cut
ties with the Bosnian Serbs last week following the latter's refusal to
accept a western-brokered peace plan. The Bosnian Serbs have faced
increasing military pressure from Moslem forces, who appear to be gaining
ground.
The Bosnian army yesterday cornered the breakaway Moslem enclave of Bihac.
Troops advanced further into the northwestern zone as several thousand
refugees continued to flee into Croatia. Mr Fikret Abdic, the rebel leader,
rejected Bosnian amnesty offers. His chief military commander was killed by
a shell yesterday as the Bosnian army built on gains made on Tuesday, when
it captured two towns on the Croatian border.
