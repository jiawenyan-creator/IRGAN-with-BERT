THE VANISHING SAND 
Thank you for your article on the sand-mining operations on the San Luis Rey 
River. The attitude at the county seems to be if one sand mine is good, then 
five will be wonderful. 
What is not mentioned in the article is the destruction of the once-beautiful 
California 76. Ironically, the county considers it a No. 1 priority scenic 
route. I really doubt that anyone from the county has looked at it lately. With 
the removal of large trees, piles of large rocks right up to the highway and 
huge sand piles, it looks more like a slum. 
We at Rancho Monserate Country Club, a senior-citizen mobile home park, have 
been inundated with sand. The prevailing winds from Oceanside send it 
throughout the park. Aside from the continual work of dusting and sweeping, 
there is the health problems it creates with residents suffering from chronic 
lung disease. 
Now we are faced with even more sand mining. A new major-use permit has been 
applied for by Millie Vessels, whose land abuts this subdivision. She is asking 
for sand mining on 560 acres. In addition, Hal Jensen is asking for a major-use 
permit for a rock quarry, asphalt plant and cement factory on Rosemary's 
Mountain, and it includes continual sand mining of the San Luis Rey for 20 
years. 
It does make you wonder where it will all end. We can only pray for extremely 
heavy rainfall and large floods in order to move the sand to Oceanside and stop 
this effort to ruin the river.
