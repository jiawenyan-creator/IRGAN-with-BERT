FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Panther makes Pounds 1.13m for six months
In its first results since taking over Etonbrook Properties in July, Panther
Securities, the property company headed by Mr Andrew Perloff, reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.13m for the six months to June 30 against Pounds
707,354 for the year to December 31.
The result included a Pounds 920,000 profit on the disposal of shares in
Cementone, formerly Multitrust.
Panther now has 85 per cent of Etonbrook. Mr Perloff said that although the
acquisition had brought Pounds 2.5m in cash and Pounds 2.2m of uncharged
properties before the minority interest, the benefits would not be apparent
until the second half.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 3.47m (Pounds 3.28m for 12 months). Earnings per
share were 49.3p (33.8p) and an interim dividend of 1.1p is declared. A 1.6p
final is anticipated.
