FT  15 JAN 93 / Council cleaners to lose jobs
ABOUT 1,000 cleaners with Devon County Council face redundancy after losing
a contract to clean the council's schools and buildings.
The redundancies come on top of claims that tens of thousands of jobs are at
risk in local government because of the government's capping limits on the
coming year's spending.
