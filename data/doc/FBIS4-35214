  [Text] Rafah, 30 May (MENA) -- Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq 
al-Mahayidah, commander of the Palestinian forces in Rafah, has 
affirmed that the Palestinian National Security Forces will not 
be an obstacle in the way of democracy and that the objective of 
their presence in the autonomous areas is to support preventive 
security and preserve public security. 
  Al-Mahayidah said that it is each person's right to express 
his political opinions and views in absolute freedom and that 
the relationship with the Palestinian opposition will be a 
serious one governed by understanding out of concern for the 
bonds of kinship and strong ties between the various 
denominations of the people. 
  In another development, the Palestinian National Security 
Command issued a decree on recruiting further members of the 
police force from inside the autonomous areas in Gaza and 
Jericho. Applications to join the police force began being 
accepted the day before yesterday. 
  It is expected that all parts of the Palestinian National 
Authority will be ready to operate this week.
