<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "BNL, Cantoni Resigns, Sarcinelli </F>
Named Chairman"] 
  [Text] Rome, 17 Feb (ANSA) -- Giampiero Cantoni resigned 
Thursday [17 February] as chairman of the Banca Nazionale del 
Lavoro [BNL, National Bank of Labor], confirming his suspension 
which he announced February 7. Mario Sarcinelli, current Deputy 
Chairman of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development, was tapped this evening by the treasury and 
industry ministers to take over Cantoni's job. 
  In a letter sent to the treasury this morning, Cantoni said 
"as I announced with my letter of February 7, I wish to confirm 
that I intend to end my mandate early." 
  Cantoni stepped down shortly before the Bank of Italy 
announced it had handed Rome magistrates details of questionable 
BNL operations unearthed in a recent check and as news broke 
that the BNL chief may have been involved in dubious property 
deals in his home town of Segrate. 
  According to well-informed sources speaking this evening, 
BNL 
will henceforth have three managing directors with Gino Trombi 
brought in from the Banco Ambroveneto to join current managing 
directors Davide Croff and Umberto D'Addosio. Deputy Chairman 
Rodolfo Rinaldi will remain on the board.
