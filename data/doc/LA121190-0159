SOVIETS HALT UPRISING; ECONOMIC PLAN REJECTED BY 2 REPUBLICS 
The Parliament of the Soviet republic of Georgia today declared a state of 
emergency in a region that was making separatist moves, and the Soviet 
republic's government reasserted its control over the rebellious area, a report 
said. 
The trouble occurred in the South Ossetian Autonomous Region, one of three 
major subdivisions of the republic of Georgia in the Transcaucasian part of the 
western Soviet Union. 
Also today, the Parliament of the Russian Federation and the president of the 
republic of Kazakh rejected Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal to 
retain central control over the economy. 
The Georgian legislature took its emergency steps two days after the South 
Ossetian region held illegal elections to form its own parliament, the 
independent Interfax news service said. 
Gorbachev has proposed a new union treaty to keep the 15 republics together and 
to maintain central government control over natural resources and major 
industries. 
But the Russian republic's Congress of People's Deputies and Nursultan 
Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, the third-largest Soviet republic, each 
said they would sign the proposed treaty only if it gives them control over 
their own economies. 
Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation has taken the same stand.
