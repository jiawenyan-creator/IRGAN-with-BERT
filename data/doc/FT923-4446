FT  07 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading M25 motorway
ACER CONSULTANTS, based at Guildford in Surrey, has been awarded a Pounds
160m contract by the Department of Transport to undertake the Stage 3 design
and supervision of the M25 motorway improvements between Junction 16 (M40)
and Junction 23 (South Mimms).
The contract, which involves project management, engineering design,
environmental studies, and traffic and economic appraisals, will be
completed totally in-house.
Following work on the M4 widening between Junctions 4b and 5, which has been
brought to tender stage, Acer will now undertake the widening of the M25 to
dual four-lane carriageway throughout, with narrow lanes at select
locations.
Assessments of all major structures will be undertaken, whilst overbridge
demolition will be restricted to a practical minimum.
Improvement of traffic movements between Junction 21 and Junction 21a will
be investigated as part of the commission, with the provision of direct
links between the M1 and the A405 favoured.
TecnEcon, economic and transport consultants and an associate member of the
Acer Group, will carry out all traffic and economic studies.
The project is about 36 kilometres long and will be divided into two
sections at the design stage which will eventually form two contracts at the
construction stage. Priority will be given to the section from Junction 16
to 19, followed by Junction 19 to 23.
The design for the first section is scheduled to take some 18 months with a
similar period identified for the second section. Supervision contracts are
scheduled to take two years.
