FT  08 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: News Corp faces fight over
Royal Doulton
News Corporation, the media, film and publishing group controlled by Mr
Rupert Murdoch, faces a legal battle with holders of its exchangeable
preference shares. This follows the announcement yesterday that they were
not entitled to Pounds 15m worth of shares in Royal Doulton, the fine china
manufacturer which last year was demerged from Pearson, owners of the
Financial Times.
The decision contradicted a notice from News Corp, published in the
Financial Times on December 13, that holders of its preference shares,
exchangeable for shares which News Corp held in Pearson, would also get
Royal Doulton shares when exercising their exchange right.
Yesterday, News Corp backed up its claim to the 5 1/2 m Royal Doulton shares
by saying that the Royal Doulton transaction had not caused a change in the
composition of the exchange property.
'The Royal Doulton shares would have constituted a capital distribution for
the purposes of the articles of association of the companies if certain
specified financial thresholds had been exceeded, but such financial
thresholds have not been exceeded and, accordingly, no capital distribution
has occurred,' News Corp said. It declined to comment further.
Stockbrokers in London and Hamburg said they and their clients were seeking
legal advice on whether they could make a counter-claim to the Royal Doulton
shares. They also intended to press for compensation from News Corp for any
financial losses incurred as a result of News Corp's actions since December
13.
