  [Text] Crimean political parties of centrist orientation 
-- the Union for Support of the Crimean Republic, the Party of 
Democratic Revival of the Crimea, the Democratic Party of the 
Crimea, and the Civic Forum of the Crimea -- have announced the 
formation of a new party bloc called "Sozidaniye" [the 
Creation]. The bloc is ready to share the responsibility for 
drawing up and implementing the program of economic reform in 
the autonomous republic with Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov. 
The first initiative of the new bloc was an appeal to Yuriy 
Meshkov to form a coalition interparty government. The leaders 
of "Sozidaniye" intend that the bloc will join the 
Kuchma-Hrynyov interregional bloc.
