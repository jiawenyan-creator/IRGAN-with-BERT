<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Nasir al-Qidwah, PLO </F>
representative at the United Nations, in New York, by Ashraf 
'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo, date not given; from the "Dialogue From 
Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Mr. Nasir al-Qidwah, good morning 
and welcome to the Voice of the Arabs. 
  [Al-Qidwah] Good morning to you. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The UN Security Council [UNSC] has postponed 
a resolution on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. What are you 
and the Arab and Islamic groups at the United Nations doing now? 
  [Al-Qidwah] As you said, it is regrettable that the Security 
Council, after more than two weeks, has not yet passed a clear 
resolution regarding the massacre of our people in Hebron. This 
was a result of the United States insisting on certain 
positions. For our part, we have insisted on a minimum level of 
justice from the Security Council to deal with the incident and 
future situations. Anyway, we may be on our way to overcoming 
the recent obstacles; and the Council may be able to pass the 
required resolution soon, hopefully today. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] You said the United States has insisted on 
certain positions, and that you insisted on other positions. 
Can you explain this? 
  [Al-Qidwah] There were many points of disagreement with the 
U.S. delegation. For example, we insisted on maintaining the 
normal Security Council position that holy Jerusalem is part of 
the occupied territories. We cannot bargain over this issue, of 
course. The United States regrettably tried to alter this 
position. We also wanted, and still want, the Security Council 
to mandate in no uncertain terms the necessary measures to 
protect the Palestinian people in the occupied territories, 
including an international presence. We have sought a clear 
mechanism to follow up on and guarantee the implementation of 
such measures. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] So the problem is the U.S. demand that 
Jerusalem be excluded from the resolution? 
  [Al-Qidwah] Without doubt, this was one of the biggest 
problems; but as I said, there were disagreements regarding the 
language that should be used regarding other issues: protection 
measures, a follow-up mechanism, and the measures the Israeli 
Government needs to take against the Israeli settlers. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Have you noticed a change in the U.S. 
position on the peace process in general and the PLO in 
particular, especially after the current moves by the Arab group 
at the United Nations? 
  [Al-Qidwah] With the full support and the cooperation of the 
Arab group, we have been very active. I cannot deny that the 
U.S. delegation was always ready to enter into continuous 
negotiations with our delegation. This necessarily means that 
they are ready, at least in principle, to deal seriously with 
the problems raised and the demands we made. But at the same 
time, as I said, there have been many differences, and so far we 
have not been able to resolve all of them. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Has the U.S. bias toward Israel become 
clear? 
  [Al-Qidwah] My impression is that the United States wants 
the 
peace process to be resumed without Israel first implementing 
some procedures as an occupation authority, in view of the 
massacre committed against the Palestinian people. We will try 
to resist this, and without doubt we will reject it. We hope 
that, through the support of our Arab brothers and other groups 
like the Nonaligned Movement and the Islamic states, we will be 
able to deal with this and overcome the difficulties. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The United States has asked for the 
Palestinians' participation in the peace process or the 
resumption of the peace process without any Palestinian 
conditions. How do you interpret this? 
  [Al-Qidwah] This is impossible. We have made it clear that 
we are interested in the peace process, but this process cannot 
be resumed or achieve success until a new reality is established 
on the ground in the occupied Palestinian territory -- a reality 
that provides protection and security for the Palestinian people 
there, a reality through which specific steps and measures could 
be taken against the settlers, that could eliminate some of 
these settlements and expedite the negotiations over the final 
status of all the settlements in the occupied territories. This 
new reality alone could be adequate to restore the peace process 
to its normal course. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] My last question: What about the Islamic 
countries' moves in the UN Security Council? 
  [Al-Qidwah] The Islamic countries group has indeed provided 
us with full support in our political moves at the United 
Nations. The Islamic Conference Organization adopted a clear 
statement in this regard. We are currently holding close 
contacts with the Islamic states that are members of the 
Security Council. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] We thank you very much. 
  [Al-Qidwah] You are welcome.
