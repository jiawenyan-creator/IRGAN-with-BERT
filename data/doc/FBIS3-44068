  [Text] Cape Town Jan 22 SAPA--The imam of the Grand Mosque 
in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, will arrive in Cape Town on Sunday, SABC 
[South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reports. A 
spokesman for the Muslim Judicial Council said Shaykh Muhammad 
al-Subayl's visit had become possible because of the political 
changes in the country. The imam would visit South Africa as an 
act of goodwill and would take part in the tri-centenary 
celebrations of Islam in South Africa, the spokesman said.
