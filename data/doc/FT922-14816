FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: ATP shares suspended at 1 1/2 p
Shares in ATP Communications, the USM-quoted advertising group, were
suspended yesterday at 1 1/2 p after the company began talks with its
bankers. Shareholders had earlier voted against a capital reorganisation at
an extraordinary meeting.
Last month ATP told shareholders that the continued existence of the company
depended on the capital reorganisation which involved a Pounds 1m share
issue. Shareholders were offered two new shares for every one held, at a
price of 2p. The proposals included the conversion of the group's preference
shares into ordinary shares.
The reorganisation proposals needed a 75 per cent majority at the
shareholder meeting to succeed.
