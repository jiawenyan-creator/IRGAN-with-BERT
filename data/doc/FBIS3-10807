<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso </F>
by unidentified TV Manchete and TV GLOBO reporters "at the door 
of his house" in Brasilia on 11 March] 
  [Text] [TV Manchete] Is Minas Gerais Governor Helio Garcia 
a good candidate for vice president on the PSDB [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party] ticket? 
  [Cardoso] Helio Garcia is certainly a good candidate, even 
for president. I would like to reiterate that I saw today's 
newspaper headlines reporting decisions that are not mine, and 
information that I did not give to my party. The subject cannot 
be managed the way it is being managed, reporting that I decided 
this or that. Reports are somehow speculating over the 
advantages or the desires of interlocutors. In addition to its 
political nature, this is a very personal matter, of a family 
nature. This type of matter must be discussed with one's own 
closer relatives. It is not a matter to be treated in terms of 
he-said-that-he-said. I have not made any decision, and there 
is no reason for it. I will continue to work. I spent the 
morning with Central Bank President Pedro Malan, with whom I 
discussed the instructions he is taking to the United States for 
negotiating the foreign debt. Brazil has already rejoined the 
international financial community. The finance minister should 
thus not be worn out by reports by saying that he is candidate 
for this, or for that. 
  [TV Globo] The newspaper headlines saying that you have 
already informed President Itamar Franco of the day on which you 
will step down -- are they inaccurate? 
  [Cardoso] I have not discussed a resignation day with 
anyone, 
not even with the PSDB. To the contrary, what I told the PSDB 
is that I can accept no conditions for a positive outcome. Any 
decision that I make will depend on a very impartial evaluation 
of what is best, first for the country, and then for me. This 
should be the procedure. I did not inform any party of this. I 
have only reported on my own difficulties, and I am saying this 
with total sincerity. Everyone knows that the PSDB wants me to 
be the candidate. I therefore need no manipulation in this 
regard. But I cannot say or do this or that if I am not certain 
that it will be positive for Brazil and for me. 
  [TV GLOBO] Would your resignation make the economic plan 
unfeasible? 
  [Cardoso] I don't believe so. It would be too pretentious of 
me. Yet I have the responsibility of verifying the effects that 
a decision to step down or to stay would have on the plan. The 
matter needs this elbow room. It also involves discussions 
within my intimate circle. I have a very good team, and I 
cannot just say "Ah, the minister has changed his mind." That 
is not my style. Through you I tell the country that this is a 
distressing decision. It is useless to speculate, because 
speculation is simply groundless. We are very far from the 
elections. The minister is not harming anyone. The minister is 
interested in other issues. The decision that I can make must be 
very carefully evaluated. I will not be driven by purely 
personal or partisan reasons. 
  [TV Manchete] PSDB President Tasso Jereissati has said that, 
if necessary, he will go to the ministry to pull you out of your 
chair. What is your reaction to this remark? 
  [Cardoso] The nails that are holding me there are very 
strong 
(laughs).
