  [Text] A regular news conference of the Social Democratic 
Party [SDP] of Bosnia-Herzegovina was held in Sarajevo today. 
On this occasion, members of the SDP Presidium called public 
attention to some negative phenomena in the political life of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. New members of the party leadership, 
Mustafa Beganovic, Miro Lazovic, and Muhamed (Ababic) were also 
presented for the first time today. Zoran Babic has the details: 
  [Begin recording] [Babic] Apart from all positive results 
in the creation of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
opening new prospects for preserving Bosnia-Herzegovina in its 
entirety, there are some very bad phenomena as well, Dr. Nijaz 
Durakovic, chairman of the SDP of Bosnia-Herzegovina, said at 
the news conference today. 
  The exclusively ethnic criterion is being promoted again, 
something that narrows down room for the activity of all those 
political parties that are not promoting themselves as eminently 
national or as presenting some sort of national representatives. 
This is certainly not good for the prospects of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and for democracy in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
which is still at its beginning. This is stifling multiparty 
political life in many sections of society. 
  Durakovic gave many examples that confirm this: Thus, the 
ruling parties, the SDA [Party of Democratic Action] and HDZ 
[Croatian Democratic Community], are only proposing their 
representatives in the cantonal assemblies, taking into 
consideration only the principle of national representation, and 
completely disregarding the principle of electoral results of 
the latest multiparty elections. The power of the two national 
teams is thereby installed again, (?as if other) parties do not 
include Bosniaks, Croats, and others, Durakovic said and 
continued: 
  [Durakovic] [words indistinct] registered so far, and I will 
give examples of Gracanica, Zivinice, the free territory of the 
Brcko Commune, Banovici, Srebrenica, and so on (?where) the SDA 
(?and HDZ) simply [words indistinct] (?almost natural right of 
taking for themselves the votes that belonged to the Serbian 
Democratic Party [SDS]. Let me be a little cynical and say that 
[word indistinct] that they are natural allies with the SDS and 
that, according to a right known to them alone, they are 
usurping votes belonging to a party that was proclaimed 
unlawful, that is, was banned. [words indistinct] establish a 
biparty national power in a way. 
  [Babic] Durakovic gave many examples of repression committed 
against members of the SDP, for instance in Tesanj. In Travnik, 
the SDP was thrown out of its offices. There are many examples 
of prominent businessmen holding leading posts being replaced 
only because they are not members of the ruling party. There 
are similar examples of repression and maltreatment in Zenica, 
Zivince, Srebrenik, and other parts of the free territory. 
  Another reason to hold a news conference was the draft law 
on 
the transformation of social property into state property that 
was adopted yesterday. According to the SDP, this was done in a 
very hasty and even undemocratic way. This is what Mr. 
Durakovic said about that: 
  [Durakovic] [words indistinct] the proposed draft law (?is 
not even) nationalization, [word indistinct] (?confiscation) of 
property, [words indistinct] (?through) cadre policy in these 
state enterprises to in fact take over complete economic and 
thereby also political power in Bosnia-Herzegovina, only to use 
some subsequent privatization for ensuring (?more suitable) 
conditions to sell that property to those [word indistinct] that 
are more politically [word indistinct] and will be [word 
indistinct]. This is a model that was used in Croatia to a great 
extent and [passage indistinct] 
  [Babic] Considering the bill's anticonstitutionality as, 
according to the current Constitution, all [word indistinct] are 
equal, and its negative consequences, members of the SDP are of 
the opinion that such a draft law should be withdrawn and that, 
one should examine the complete situation using experience of 
others, and propose a law that would quickly help create 
conditions for privatizing (?social) [word indistinct]. [end
