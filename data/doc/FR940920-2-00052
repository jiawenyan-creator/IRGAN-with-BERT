ACTION:

 Notice of Draft NPDES General Permit.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Regional Administrator, Region 10, is proposing to issue a draft National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) general permit for oil and gas stratigraphic test and exploration wells on the Alaskan Outer Continental
Shelf and contiguous state waters. The proposed Arctic general permit will authorize offshore oil and gas stratigraphic
test and exploration wells in the federal and state waters of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. Development and production
wells are not authorized to discharge by this general permit.



Unlike previous general permits for the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, the Arctic general permit will cover a geographic
area not defined by specific state and federal lease sale tracts. Rather, the area of coverage includes the following:




_Federal waters of the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea planning basins as defined by the Minerals Management Service
(MMS) (see U.S. Dept. of the Interior, 1992), and

_State waters contiguous to the landward boundary of the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning basins.




The permit will authorize discharges from exploratory operations in all areas offered for lease by the U.S. Department
of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) included in previous general permits issued by EPA for the Beaufort
and Chukchi Seas. This includes federal lease sales 71, 87, 97, and 109; and state lease sales 36, 39, 43, and 43A, Federal/State
lease sale BF; and ``contiguous state lease sales'' which were covered by the modification for the Beaufort Sea II
NPDES general permit (54 FR 39574, September 27, 1989). Additional lease sale areas not previously covered by a permit
will include, but are not limited to, the following: MMS federal lease sales 124 and 126; and state lease sales 65 and
68.

A brief description of the basis for the conditions and requirements of the proposed permit is given in the fact sheet
published below.
