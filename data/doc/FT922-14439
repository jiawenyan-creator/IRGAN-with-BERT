FT  07 APR 92 / Non-conformists test Clinton's stability: Democratic
primaries in New York and the mid-West promise conflicting signals
IT IS perfectly possible to construct the historically correct argument
that, as often as not, the primary elections in the two largest states in
the union, California and New York, do not matter in the choice of a
presidential nominee for the Democratic party.
California's problem is that it votes last, by which time presidential
nominations are usually sewn up. So, in preferring Brown to Carter in 1976,
Kennedy to Carter four years later and Hart over Mondale in 1984, it was
merely bolting the stable door too late.
New York's problem is that it is sui generis, delighting mostly in giving
whoever is the front-runner, especially if from the south, a necessary
come-uppance. It has only held a true preference primary since 1980, when it
went for Kennedy not Carter. In 1988, however, it gave Dukakis, then barely
the favourite, the lift he sorely needed.
Wisconsin, rather neglected this time because of the concentration on New
York, is also a state with a history of non-conformism. It went for McCarthy
in 1968 (though President Johnson had already withdrawn and no one else
serious was on the ballot), McGovern in 1972, Carter by a fraction in 1976
but convincingly in 1980, and Hart four years later.
Many of these facts, and more, may be recited tonight by his spin doctors if
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas does not win the New York primary with a
bit to spare. A victory in New York would at least offset a failure in
Wisconsin, where Mr Clinton himself has sensed vulnerability.
A defeat, however, would set more cats among his pigeons. Even though, in
both states and the smaller Kansas primary, he will get a good chunk of
delegates, it will make all the more difficult to win enough by California
and New Jersey on June 2 to assure a first ballot nomination. As it is,
before today's vote he needed to win 57 per cent of all those remaining to
be determined to reach the prize.
This remains still a Clinton-Brown contest, though Paul Tsongas, who may get
some votes and delegates in New York, drops hints he might get back in the
race again, and Governor Mario Cuomo of New York never ceases to muddy the
waters with his delphic utterances.
Serious alternatives to Mr Clinton and Mr Brown do not seem to exist at
present. As R W Apple, dean of the New York Times political staff, wrote on
March 29: 'There are only four options now - Mr Clinton, Mr Brown, a late
starting candidate or a brokered convention. Of the four, the nomination of
Mr Brown, unlikely as the thought may seem, is certainly no less likely than
alternatives three and four.'
A serious collapse by Mr Clinton, however, might increase the chances of the
brokered convention. Here a decisive role could be played by the 722
so-called 'super delegates', in effect party big-wigs who will go to Madison
Square Garden in July in theory uncommitted (though some have already come
out for Mr Clinton).
This might conceivably winkle out of hiding the likes of New Jersey Senator
Bill Bradley, House majority leader Richard Gephardt, Tennessee Senator Al
Gore or West Virginia Senator Jay Rockefeller, not to mention Mr Tsongas and
Mr Cuomo.
But the last approximation of a brokered convention was in 1968, a truly
extraordinary year, and there is no sign that any of the above not now
running will want to be pawns in an end game likely to lead to a thrashing
in November.
If Mr Clinton does survive New York, where his campaign seemed to have
stabilised around the middle of last week, and if the Brown insurgency
begins to falter, as it began to under the glare of scrutiny, then the game
will be back to where it was after Illinois and Michigan voted on March 17.
There will be a presumptive nominee about whom many doubts persist but who
is not so far behind George Bush as to be devoid of hope. And there will
still be a very long way to go.
