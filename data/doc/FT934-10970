FT  03 NOV 93 / E Midlands urges interest rate cuts
BUSINESS leaders in the east Midlands, one of the most diversified of the
industrial regions, are demanding further cuts in interest rates to
strengthen a weak and patchy economic recovery.
The latest regional survey of business performance shows that conditions
have not improved to the extent expected last spring. Yet despite this
finding the survey, produced by accountancy firm Price Waterhouse and
Nottingham Business School, says that trading is better than it was a year
ago.
Although 58 per cent of businesses reported higher sales during the past six
months and 43 per cent an increase in profits, financial pressures
continued.
Nearly two-thirds of companies reported either holding or decreasing their
selling prices. The speed at which bills are paid does not seem to have
increased.
The proportion of manufacturers using more than 90 per cent of capacity
declined to 20 per cent from 27 per cent last spring.
Similarly, the regional chambers of commerce have reported a fall in the
number of companies working at full capacity, alongside a flattening out of
domestic orders and a decline in exports.
The regional Confederation of British Industry is warning Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, not to choke what it calls 'the relatively weak and patchy
recovery' with his Budget later this month.
For individual businesses, however, the key stimulus to recovery would be a
further fall in interest rates. This is seen as a priority by 65 per cent of
companies in the Price Waterhouse sample.
The survey was drawn from a sample of 958 companies, 84 per cent of which
employ fewer than 200 people.
