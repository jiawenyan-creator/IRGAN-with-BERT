  [Text] Prague March 2 (CTK) -- The Czech Government is 
watching with "certain apprehension" Austria's steps concerning 
the completion of the Temelin nuclear power plant in South 
Bohemia, Premier Vaclav Klaus said Wednesday [2 March] after a 
cabinet meeting. 
  He said the Austrian ambassador to the United States on 
Tuesday [1 March] again visited the EXIM bank president and sent 
a letter to several senators and congressmen containing a 
500-page supplement in different languages. 
  On January 27, the EXIM bank agreed to provide a guarantee 
for a loan to the Westinghouse firm worth 317 million dollars to 
complete Temelin. The U.S. Congress had 35 days to express its 
opinion on the project and the deadline will expire on March 3. 
The bank could theoretically step down from the project if a 
sufficiently large number of congressmen exert strong pressure 
on it. 
  Klaus said the Czech Government was "watching attentively" 
further actions by the Austrian officials in this matter. He 
said so far the Czech Republic has been successful in rejecting 
Austrians' "unfounded allegations." "The government is quite 
sure that the guarantee question will be positively settled at a 
congress meeting on March 10," Klaus said. 
  He said the acceptance of Austria into the European Union 
(EU) would not lend strength to Austrian opposition against 
Temelin. "I would not see any connection in it since Austria is 
one of the few EU members that are not inclined towards nuclear 
power," Klaus said. 
  The Czech Government did not see the acceptance of Sweden, 
Finland and Austria to the EU as some sort of signal that the 
acceptance of the Czech Republic might be speeded up, Klaus 
said, in reaction to the statement made by the Hungarian foreign 
minister that Hungary intended to ask for full EU membership.
