FT  28 SEP 94 / Observer: Pomp and circumstances
A puff of white smoke goes up tomorrow as the City of London picks the next
Lord Mayor to follow the much-travelled Sir Paul Newall, the Lehman Brothers
investment banker. The strong favourite is 58-year-old Christopher Walford
of City solicitors Allen &amp; Overy, a partner there since 1972.
Perhaps the more interesting question, however, is who comes next. While a
rough batting order is long established among the Court of 25 aldermen, 12
of whom have not 'passed the chair' at any one time, private circumstances
such as Lloyd's losses - as well as more mysterious factors - can lead to
names dropping by the wayside.
Roger Cork, son of the late Sir Kenneth Cork who was also a Lord Mayor in
his time, seems to have moved up the field, as has John Chalstrey, a surgeon
at Bart's Hospital. Chalstrey is already 63, and hence would have some
priority on age grounds. Richard Nichols, a solicitor, is admitted to the
office of Sheriff today, and also therefore becomes eligible to be Mayor.
If, as it seems, two or three others have been passed over, Sir Peter Levene
moves up the list as a consequence. The nearer he gets, of course, the
trickier life becomes in his current position as chairman and chief
executive of Canary Wharf - the City's arch rival. Then again, he doesn't
have to worry about not picking up his K.
