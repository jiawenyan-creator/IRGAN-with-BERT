THE STATE 
The San Francisco Police Depatment promised to stop officers from impersonating 
television cameramen while videotaping demonstrations after two broadcast 
journalists discovered an impostor in their midst. Police Chief Frank Jordan, 
who made the promise when broadcast organizations attacked the practice, 
confirmed that a police officer had posed as a cameraman for KING-TV of Seattle 
while videotaping a protest in front of the El Salvador consul general's 
office. The incident came to light after two journalists from KGO-TV noticed 
someone they believed to be an impostor filming the peaceful protest.
