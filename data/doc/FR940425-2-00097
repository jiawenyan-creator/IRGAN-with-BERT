I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change would allow GSCC to continue to offer comparison and netting services for non-member trades
which have been submitted to GSCC by netting members on behalf of non-members executing firms.

(C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



(a) On December 13, 1991, the Commission approved, on a temporary basis through December 31, 1992, a rule change authorizing
GSCC to implement a non-member, ``executing firm'' information feature as an enhancement to its comparison service.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 On December 23, 1992, the Commission extended its temporary approval of the executing firm feature until June 30,

</FOOTNOTE>


On February 14, 1992, GSCC introduced the executing firm feature, which allows trade data to be submitted to GSCC by
a member (the ``submitting member'') on behalf of a non-member firm (the ``executing firm'') that it clears for by
adding two new fields to the comparison system: (1) The name of the executing party associated with the member; and
(2) the name of the executing party associated with the contra-party member. If a submitting member that is a netting
member so elects, a netting eligible trade that it has submitted on behalf of an executing firm may be included in the
net, and the submitting member would be obligated to GSCC as regards such trade to the same degree as if it itself had
executed such trade; therefore, such trade would be considered for purposes of calculating the submitting member's
mark and margin requirements. However, an eligible trade submitted by a submitting member on behalf of an executing
firm will not be included in the net if the submitting member has informed GSCC that it does not wish, because of the type
of relationship that it has with the executing firm (i.e., it does not normally guarantee settlement of such firm's
trades), to have the trades executed by such firm be netted and novated by GSCC .

Initially, participation in the executing firm feature was modest; however, participation has grown significantly
over the past year. Currently, twelve GSCC members have agreements in place pursuant to which, collectively, they
may submit data on trades executed by 271 non-members. GSCC expects that the number of submitting members and executing
firms will continue to grow. GSCC has not experienced any operational or other problems with regard to the executing
firm feature.

GSCC believes that the executing firm feature provides significant benefit to the government securities industry
by improving reconciliation of unmatched trade data and, thus, providing the benefits of GSCC's comparison process
to a broader range of trades. This feature allows access by a greater number of firms (who may otherwise be ineligible
for direct membership in GSCC's netting system) to GSCC's netting and risk management services, including broker-dealers
and institutional customers. The result is that, through the executing firm feature, a greater number of government
securities trades are being margined, netted, and guaranteed by GSCC than would otherwise be the case.
