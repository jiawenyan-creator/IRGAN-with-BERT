FT  05 DEC 94 / Berlusconi's fans rally in cities
Tens of thousands of supporters of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime
minister, took to the streets of Italy's largest cities over the weekend, as
anti-corruption magistrates kept up the pressure on his business associates.
'This is a demonstration in support of Berlusconi, a man who has saved the
country,' Mr Cesare Previti, defence minister and a close friend of Mr
Berlusconi, told a rally of more than 20,000 supporters in Rome yesterday.
The rallies were co-ordinated by the local 'clubs' of Forza Italia, the
political movement founded by Mr Berlusconi this year. They were prompted by
Milan magistrates' decision two weeks ago to invite him in for questioning
about alleged bribery of tax police by his Fininvest business empire.
Yesterday, Mr Jas Gawronski, the prime minister's spokesman, said Mr
Berlusconi would be unable to meet the magistrates before December 13
because of international commitments.
The delay will give Mr Berlusconi more time to build on the goodwill
generated last week when trade unions cancelled a general strike after
concessions on the 1995 budget and pensions reform.
The Northern League, the most volatile of Mr Berlusconi's government allies,
was not involved in the rallies and was attacked by many demonstrators for
not backing him wholeheartedly. The results of a second round of mayoral
elections yesterday could see Forza Italia punished for its uncomfortable
alliance with the League in northern cities such as Brescia and Sondrio,
where its candidates were lagging after the first round.
