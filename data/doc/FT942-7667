FT  24 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow stumbles as rates worries
resurface
Wall Street
Concern over rising interest rates resurfaced in the US stock markets as
share prices followed bonds sharply lower, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 23.94 at 3,742.41, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dropped 1.72 to 453.20.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was off 0.56 at 437.64,
and the Nasdaq composite shed 1.75 to 724.95.
There was no fresh economic news yesterday to drive stocks. However, the
break in the release calendar served to fix investors' focus on the bond
market, which was experiencing heavy losses. The dollar was weakening again
against the D-mark and prices of gold and other commodities were up sharply,
a concern for investors in fixed-rate instruments such as government
securities.
The renewed weakness in bonds, after last week's firmer trend, was more than
enough to trigger a downward adjustment in share prices, following a
107-point net jump in the Dow industrials in the previous five sessions.
But yesterday's decline may have reflected a shift in sentiment that ran
deeper than a desire to book profits after a big rally. Investors seemed to
be growing increasingly concerned that the bear market in bonds, triggered
by the Federal Reserve's shift in monetary policy in early February, was not
brought to a halt by last week's fourth move by the central bank to tighter
money.
The upturn in the financial markets since Tuesday's rate increase was built
on the widespread perception that the Fed would hold off on further rate
actions until the end of the summer. But rising commodity prices and the
soft dollar were now clouding the outlook and complicating the strategic
perspective of equity investors.
Among the cyclicals, Procter &amp; Gamble dropped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 55 and
3M shed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 51 1/8 . In the energy sector, Chevron lost
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 86 7/8 .
Amid the general decline, there was at least one bright spot. Shares in
Gerber Products, the most active NYSE issue, surged Dollars 15 1/2 , or
about 45 per cent, to Dollars 50 1/2 on the announcement that Sandoz, the
Swiss pharmaceuticals house, had agreed to buy the baby-food maker for
Dollars 3.7bn, or Dollars 53 a share.
There was speculation about more takeovers in the sector which helped lift
the share prices of other food processing groups. CPC International gained
Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 48 and Philip Morris added Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars
55 1/4 .
Kodak also outperformed the market. The stock climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 47 after a federal court lifted long-established restrictions on the
company's marketing activities.
Toronto was closed for a public holiday.
Mexico
Equities ended firmer for the fifth straight session, buoyed by hopes
domestic interest rates will be stable or decline at the weekly Treasury
bill auction.
The 37-share IPC index ended up 14.13 points, or 0.58 per cent, at 2,431.43.
Turnover was a heavy 132.06m.
The bill auction is held today and results are announced Wednesday. Analysts
said that they saw the IPC index hitting its short-term resistance level at
2,520 this week before a bout of profit-taking.
Brazil
Shares eased from the day's highs to close up 3.1 per cent after the market
absorbed a mild profit-taking bout sparked by a drop in US stocks.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares ended up 646 at 20,963
points. Turnover was CR280.4bn (Dollars 137m).
