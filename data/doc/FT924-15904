FT  02 OCT 92 / De Hooch may fetch Pounds 6.5m: Saleroom
ONE OF the masterpieces of the 'golden age' of Dutch painting, 'The
Courtyard of a House in Delft' by Pieter de Hooch, is to be sold at
Christie's in London on December 11.
Up to Pounds 6.5m is expected for the work, which creates illusions of space
by views through half-opened doors. It was painted by de Hooch in 1658 and
is similar to a picture in the National Gallery depicting the same
courtyard.
If it reaches its target price, the Old Master should achieve the highest
price in the autumn saleroom season. In the same sale, Christie's is
offering five works by Rubens, including a portrait of Madame de Vicq that
has been lost from view since it sold at Christie's in 1848 for 205 guineas.
Phillips won the competition to be the auction house to dispose of the stock
of David Messum, the leading dealer in British Impressionist paintings,
whose London gallery recently went into receivership.
In all, 600 paintings with a value of at least Pounds 900,000 will be sold
over two years, with the first auction on November 17 including works by Sir
John Lavery and Matthew Smith.
In New York on Wednesday, Sotheby's achieved an auction record for a comic.
A copy of the first issue of Action Comics, published in June 1938, sold for
Dollars 82,500 (Pounds 47,210).
It features the first appearance of Superman.
