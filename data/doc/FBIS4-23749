  [Excerpt] Kampala, 14 June (PANA) -- More than 2,000 
Sudanese refugees are now camped in Bibia in northern Uganda 
after fleeing intensified fighting between government forces and 
the rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in 
neighboring Sudan, the state-owned NEW VISION newspaper reported 
today. 
  It said the town of Nimule in southern Sudan was last week 
tense as residents feared an attack from government troops. 
This followed the dropping of leaflets by government troops 
advising the civilian population to quickly vacate the town as 
bombing was imminent. Thousands of civilians were seen walking, 
carrying personal belongings away from Nimule. Trucks of the 
United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) were by 
Tuesday [14 June] still ferrying fleeing Sudanese between Nimule 
and Bibia. The refugees were later being transferred to refugee 
camps in Moyo District, north-western Uganda. 
  As the war for control of Nimule intensified, there is 
apparently no hope of SPLA troops resisting the seemingly well 
organized government troops, the NEW VISION said. The newspaper 
said refugees were moving in tribal groups. The Dinka, who 
consider themselves a higher class, refuse to share camps with 
other tribes. Dinkas are camped at Lobone camp in southern 
Sudan bordering the Ugandan District of Kitgum. Most 
non-government organizations that had operated in the rebel-held 
southern Sudan had also fled the area for northern Uganda.
