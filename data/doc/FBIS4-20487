  [Text] A thermophilic Streptomyces producing extracellular 
proteinase in high level was isolated from soil. The protease 
has an optimum reaction temperature of 70C and was stable 
at 60C. It retains 84 percent activity even after treatment 
of 80C for 10 min. Ca[.sup]2+[/] enhanced the heat 
stability of the enzyme obviously. The optimum pH for casein 
hydrolysis was 8.5. The enzyme was stable over the pH range from 
5 to 9. The enzyme was inactivated after treatment with PMSF 
[phenylmethylsulfuryl], but not inactivated by EDTA 
[ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid] and _a_-_a_' Bipyridin. the 
cation such as Cu[.sup]2+[/], Zn[.sup]2+[/], 
Fe[.sup]2+[/] and Co[.sup]2+[/] inhibited the enzyme 
activity while Ca[.sup]2+[/] tends to stimulate activity.
