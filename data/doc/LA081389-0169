MOBIL'S PLANS FOR PICNIC AT REFINERY 
People worry needlessly. Take those who are concerned about a possible killer 
cloud of hydrogen fluoride from the Mobil Oil refinery. Mobil officials have 
the problem well in hand. They're treating it with hot dogs and jugglers! (The 
Times, Aug. 10) 
Of course, their big picnic has nothing to do with the March initiative banning 
their use of hydrofluoric acid at their plant. Their spokesman has said so. 
Regardless, those who favor the initiative do so because they realize that an 
accident causing a major release of hydrogen fluoride can happen with the very 
best management. The probability of an accident only jumps up with a management 
which substitutes public relations campaigns for real safety. 
Come on, Mobil! $200,000 for public relations, $88,000 for a tame experts' 
report and how much more for damages after a disaster? 
Dump your hydrofluoric acid process. You don't need it and neither do we. It 
will be cheaper in the long run. 
Have you figured the cost of mustard for those hot dogs?
