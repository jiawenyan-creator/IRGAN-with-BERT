FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Mercury Asset has 9.65% of Zeneca
MERCURY Asset Management, the investment management company controlled by SG
Warburg, has built up a 9.65 per cent stake in Zeneca, the pharmaceuticals
company spun off from Imperial Chemical Industries last June.
Warburg advised Zeneca on its demerger from ICI and its Pounds 1.3bn rights
issue in June.
Yesterday, Warburg disclosed that it and MAM together owned 10 per cent of
Zeneca's shares, triggering a notification requirement to the Stock Exchange
under new Companies Act rules which took effect on September 18. Up until
then, institutions had to notify the Exchange when they held voting rights
of 3 per cent or more of a company's shares.
MAM said that since the flotation it had been building the stake on behalf
of clients. But because its policy was not to seek voting rights from the
clients whose money it handles, there had been no need to notify the
Exchange.
Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that the amendment to the Companies Act had
several drafting errors in that exemptions from notification requirements
should have been included for authorised members of investment exchanges,
such as Warburg. Had the rule been properly drafted, Warburg would not have
needed to make its announcement yesterday.
The Department of Trade and Industry said that amendments to correct the
omissions were expected to be submitted to parliament shortly.
Warburg said that of the 94.5m shares, only 3.3m, or 0.35 per cent of
Zeneca's issued equity, was held by non-MAM parts of the group.
At yesterday's closing share price of 737p, a rise of 8p, Warburg's holding
is worth Pounds 697m.
