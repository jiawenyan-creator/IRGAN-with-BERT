FT  16 APR 91 / Labour puts emphasis on nurseries
A LABOUR government would switch Pounds 50m a year from the spending
programmes of City Technology Colleges to fund expansion of nursery
education, the party said yesterday.
The party has invited local authorities to submit outline plans for
increasing nursery education in their areas. Mr Jack Straw, shadow education
secretary, said: 'There is no time to waste in creating these
opportunities.'
Labour's proposals allow the party to back its pledge to increase nursery
provision, with a specific spending commitment without having to promise an
increase in overall spending. It says total spending on education would
depend on decisions that can be made only when the party is in office.
Labour has said it would provide a nursery place for every child aged three
or four whose parents want one. The Pounds 50m a year allocated for capital
spending by City Technology Colleges could fund 20,000 new part-time nursery
places, the party calculates.
Mr Straw attacked the CTCs as 'extremely wasteful'. Capital spending on CTCs
was 80 times that for local authority schools and they had failed to attract
the business sponsorship the government had predicted. Pupils at existing
CTCs would not be affected.
