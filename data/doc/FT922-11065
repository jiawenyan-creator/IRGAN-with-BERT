FT  28 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage unwinding
breaks Nikkei's three-day gain
ARBITRAGE unwinding and declines in the US on Friday pushed the Nikkei
average down in thin trading yesterday after three consecutive gains, writes
Neil Weinberg in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index lost 91.93 to 17,450.52 after reaching a day's high of
17,615.72 and a low of 17,301.08.
The Topix index of all first section shares eased 1.06 to 1,312.85, but
rises led declines by 510 to 448, with 171 issues unchanged. Volume fell to
200m shares from Friday's 300m. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was off
0.02 at 1,071.12.
With the market trading at a premium to futures, investors took to selling
shares and buying futures to unwind arbitrage positions, pushing the index
to an intraday low in the first hour.
Prices then recovered on investment trust and pension fund buying, with
activity focused on large-capital and speculative issues, such as Mineba,
the day's most active stock, which rose Y8 to Y507.
The market largely shrugged off the weekend meeting of the Group of Seven
nations. The yen was mixed in spite of official statements in support of a
strengthening against other major currencies.
Mr Ross Purdie of SG Warburg Securities said: 'The G7 meetings are being
viewed from an exchange rate point of view or news of environment-related
initiatives. An external shock such as a swing in the yen or overseas stock
markets could have a very pronounced effect on Japanese stocks in this type
of trading.'
The government has recently announced a number of initiatives to support the
market: it is allowing the establishment of investment trusts that are
pooling corporate funds for repurchase of their own stocks, and has
announced a rise in the proportion of national pension funds allotted for
stock investments over the next few months.
There was some bargain hunting of blue chips later in the day by domestic
pension funds and investment trusts. Leading electricals remained in the
spotlight, with TDK adding Y90 at Y4,450 and NEC firming Y10 to Y1,040.
Pharmaceuticals also fared well, with Daiichi gaining Y40 to Y1,480 and
Yamanouchi advancing Y20 to Y2,600. Motorcycle makers have also garnered
buying interest in recent sessions, on expected strong demand from China and
south-east Asia. Honda Motor finished Y10 up at Y1,600.
Financial shares were widely lower, with Tokio Marine &amp; Fire receding Y12 to
Y998 on a weak earnings outlook and Mitsubishi Bank declining Y40 to Y1,800.
Department stores also retreated: Mitsukoshi and Takashimaya both dropped to
lows for the year and closed off Y19 at Y820 and Y40 at Y1,100 respectively.
In Osaka, the OSE average put on 83.40 to 19,755.13 in volume of 11.7m
shares.
