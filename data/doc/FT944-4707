FT  07 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: PaineWebber
Yesterday Lex incorrectly stated that PaineWebber was jettisoning Kidder
Peabody's Tokyo office and stock exchange membership, and dismantling its
mortgage-backed bond portfolio. In fact, when PaineWebber agreed to acquire
certain assets of Kidder Peabody, it had the option to acquire the Tokyo
operations but elected not to. The mortgage-backed portfolio was never part
of the asset-purchase agreement.
