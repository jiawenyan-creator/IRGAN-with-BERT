FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: GrandMet plans share split
Grand Metropolitan, the food, drinks and retailing group, is to make a
2-for-1 share split to give the shares 'wider appeal,' Sir Allen Sheppard,
chairman, told the annual meeting.
Sir Allen forecast that the group's first half performance - excluding the
one-off benefit of disposal of the Express Dairy and Eden Vale operations -
should 'be in line with last year.'
City analysts reacted by trimming their full-year profits forecasts by about
Pounds 40m to between Pounds 1.02bn and Pounds 1.04bn.
