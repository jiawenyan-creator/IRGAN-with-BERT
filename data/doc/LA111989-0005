ERNEST FLEISCHMANN 
History tell us that the pen is mightier than the sword. Martin Bernheimer has 
a pen that he brandishes like a rapier and sometimes like a meat cleaver. The 
headline writers followed Bernheimer's lead and selected an equally derogatory 
title for the article, "The Tyrant of the Philharmonic." 
Would you be kind enough to grant Fleischmann eight pages to respond to 
Bernheimer? If not, then it is time for the Los Angeles Times to hire a 
critics' critic to review this famous self-proclaimed operatic authority.
