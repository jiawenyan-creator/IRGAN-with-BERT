FT  24 JUN 94 / German strikers offer truce
Leaders of Germany's postal and telecommunications workers yesterday offered
to suspend their campaign of token strikes, as the danger of political
deadlock over the country's privatisation programme for Deutsche Telekom and
the postal service loomed closer. The unions want to accelerate negotiations
with their employers to determine post-privatisation deals for workers'
participation in management and social benefits. They claim the employers
are deliberately dragging out the talks to raise the political pressure for
a solution, because the Bundestag has to approve the draft privatisation law
by next Wednesday if it is to come into effect this year.
The law requires the approval of the opposition Social Democratic Party
(SPD) as well as the ruling coalition to change the status of the postal
service in the German constitution, but yesterday SPD deputies abstained
when it went through committee because of continuing concern at the
unresolved labour talks.
