COUNTY JAIL EMPLOYEE ARRESTED ON DRUG, SHOPLIFTING CHARGES 
A Sheriff's Department corrections counselor has been arrested on drug and 
shoplifting charges, a San Diego police spokesman said Tuesday. 
Judith Christine Schaefer, 38, of Mission Valley, was booked into the Las 
Colinas women's jail early Saturday on charges of possession of a controlled 
substance, being under the influence of a controlled substance and petty theft, 
spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
Tom Reed, a Sheriff's Department personnel section supervisor, confirmed that 
Schaefer is a counselor at the El Cajon jail, where she reportedly had the 
authority to assign inmates to various facilities throughout the jail system. 
Sgt. Jim Cooke, a Sheriff's Department spokesman, refused to comment on the 
arrest. 
Schaefer was arrested at 1:30 a.m. Saturday at the Advantage store on Balboa 
Avenue, Robinson said. The arresting officer allegedly recovered $128 in 
merchandise, less than an ounce of marijuana, and three packets of an 
unidentified white powdery substance from Schaefer, Robinson said.
