FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: VME and Hitachi join forces
VME, the Brussels-based construction equipment producer, and Japan's Hitachi
Construction Machinery will today announce that they have agreed to work
together in the rigid dumptruck and mining equipment business.
The deal is potentially one of the most important tie-ups between western
and Japanese construction equipment companies. It also creates a third force
in the world mining equipment market, after Caterpillar and Komatsu.
Hitachi will take a substantial minority stake in VME's Euclid brand rigid
dumptruck business. By joining forces, the two companies believe they will
be able to offer better service to customers, which will increase the
competitiveness of both lines in the mining industry.
The backdrop to the deal is the overcapacity and lack of profitability in
the world mining equipment industry. Its customers, large mining and quarry
companies, make big, but infrequent capital investments.
'The market is even more cyclical than construction equipment,' said Mr Tuve
Johannesson, VME's president and chief executive. 'We need to have muscle
where ever there is a market.'
Mr Johannesson stressed that the deal was a way for VME to increase its
involvement in mining equipment without making heavy investments to produce
the very large excavators used by mining companies. These will be supplied
by Hitachi, which does not produce rigid dumptrucks.
The two types of equipment are used together by mining and quarry companies;
Caterpillar, the equipment market leader, produces both.
VME and Hitachi plan to co-ordinate closely the sale of larger mining
excavators and rigid dumptrucks. But Mr Bengt Ovlinger, VME's senior
vice-president for marketing, said reciprocal manufacturing - especially of
larger components - would also be explored.
