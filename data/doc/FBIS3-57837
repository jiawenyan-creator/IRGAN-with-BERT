Reforms"] 
  [Text] Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt is demanding a 
reform of pension insurance during the next parliamentary term. 
  Rexrodt told FOCUS that pensions are "by no means" 
safeguarded after the year 2010. The Free Democratic Party of 
Germany minister thus rejected attempts by Labor Minister 
Norbert Bluem and Christian Democratic Union [CDU] social expert 
Heiner Geissler to stifle the discussion on pensions. 
  "Populist-oriented politicians fear that this encourages a 
weariness with politics and that elderly people could turn their 
backs on the CDU." Bluem "must now have the courage to say: In 
the interest of 30-year-olds we have to think beyond the year 
2010." 
  The economics minister suggests that the time spent bringing 
up children should be taken more into account in calculating 
pensions. 
  Rexrodt rejects the idea of a basic pension, suggested by 
Saxony's Minister-President Kurt Biedenkopf, because "this would 
mean that nonachievement would also pay." Hundreds of thousands 
of people would no longer pay any contributions if they got a 
basic pension anyway. "You would have to be stupid to pay," the 
minister said.
