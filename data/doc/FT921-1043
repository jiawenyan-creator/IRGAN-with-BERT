FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lambert Howarth ahead 14% as margins
improve
IMPROVED MARGINS helped Lambert Howarth, the footwear manufacturer and
importer, lift pre-tax profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 3.3m in the year to
December 31. Turnover increased by 6 per cent from Pounds 45.7m to Pounds
48.6m.
Mr Roger Rowland, chairman, said a higher percentage of leather footwear was
manufactured in response to increased demand for higher grade shoes. This
was partly linked to orders from Marks and Spencer and partly to a switch in
customer preference away from synthetic shoes.
Lambert Howarth Global was the only area of the business to increase its
sales but John Graham, the men's shoes business purchased in 1990, had a
profitable second half following its move to Burnley last May, Mr Rowland
said.
He pointed out that there had been delays in obtaining planning permission
for the freehold building purchased in London, but renovation started in the
new year and occupation was expected by September.
The company had also bought a building next to its Greenbridge factory,
which would be refurbished. The production of the general trade division
would be consolidated on one site this year. Savings would flow through
fully in 1993. Related reorganisation costs of Pounds 320,000 were taken as
an exceptional item.
The proposed final dividend rises to 8.5p making a total of 12.5p (11.25p).
Earnings per share were 39.3p (31.1p) following lower tax of Pounds 1.02m
(Pounds 1.11m).
