FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: Bank of Scotland disposal
BANK OF Scotland is to sell its 30 per cent stake in Dorian Bank, the
Athens-based private concern controlled by Mr John Mavrakakis, a Greek
shipowner, following Dorian's decision to expand into commercial lending.
Mr Antony Mantzavinos, president of Dorian, said yesterday that 'a friendly
separation' had been agreed.
Mr Mavrakakis, who holds the other 70 per cent of Dorian, is to buy the
British bank's stake through Dorian Hellenic, a holding company.
He said negotiations were under way with several Greek investors interested
in taking minority holdings and contributing to a capital increase for the
bank.
Bank of Scotland took an equity stake in Dorian when it was set up three
years ago to provide merchant banking and ship financing services in Greece.
The bank's capital base of Dr2.2bn (Pounds 6.6m) was raised to Dr5bn last
year.
'The market has developed differently and we're changing our strategy,
expanding into commercial banking, which is not the focus of Bank of
Scotland's foreign activities,' Mr Mantzavinos said.
After reporting losses of Dr647m in 1991, its first full year of operation,
Dorian forecast net profits of Dr300m for last year.
Bank of Scotland acknowledged that the change in market conditions in Greece
had forced Dorian to re-focus its strategy away from fee-earning services to
include more corporate lending and other medium term credit products, which
would require increased capital to support future growth. As a result the
attraction of continuing as a shareholder in Dorian 'has diminished', it
said.
Mr Jim Malcolm, assistant general manager of Bank of Scotland's
international division, said the reasons for withdrawing from the Dorian
operations were specific to that market.
'This is not a change of strategy as far as Europe is concerned,' he said,
'we are still very interested.'
