  [Text] Bratislava, May 10 (CTK) -- Finance Minister Rudolf 
Filkus excludes the possibility that the government will put off 
solving Slovakia's basic economic problems until after the 
upcoming elections. In an interview with CTK today, Filkus said 
that the Moravcik government had already promised when it 
assumed power to continue economic reform despite the great 
political risk involved. Filkus commented that while it was not 
possible for all economic problems to be immediately resolved, 
the government would handle individual cases. 
  According to Filkus, the repeated shelving by the Slovak 
Government of the proposal to improve the insolvency of 
companies is one of the reasons for the current depth of the 
problem. "If we want to help insolvent companies we have to come 
with a bag of money, and that we don't have," he said. But 
despite this, Filkus expects economic renewal through an influx 
of foreign capital and privatization.
