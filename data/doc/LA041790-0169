BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY 
Stock in Limbo: Trading in the stock of Southland Communications, which is 
being investigated by federal securities regulators, did not resume Monday 
after expiration of a suspension announced 10 days ago by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
The National Assn. of Securities Dealers has made no decision about whether to 
allow Southland stock to resume trading, said spokesman Enno Hobbing. 
Meanwhile, Southland issued a statement on Monday saying that, despite rumors 
to the contrary, the company retains its biggest contract to provide pagers to 
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. The company also said it continues to operate and 
"does not understand the reason for the unfounded, unconfirmed rumors 
concerning the company."
