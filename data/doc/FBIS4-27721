  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jun 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Prime 
Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said Sunday, the news fabrication 
about Malaysia supplying arms to Bosnian Muslims is probably 
aimed at preventing Malaysian forces from serving in that 
country. 
  In line with established rules, any country involved in arms 
running would be isolated and prevented from serving under the 
United Nations banner, he said. 
  It therefore looks like an attempt to isolate us, Dr. 
Mahathir told reporters when asked to comment on the news 
fabrication. 
  Dr. Mahathir said Malaysia would not do anything against the 
rules as it would be barred from serving in Bosnia where the 
services of Malaysian soldiers were very much needed. 
  He said the Bosnians were being threatened that if they did 
not accept the peace proposal of the West, they would withdraw 
their forces from there. 
  If that were to happen and Malaysian forces would also not 
be 
able to serve there then the Bosnian Muslims would be 
slaughtered and there would be no one to help them, Dr. Mahathir 
said. 
  The prime minister also reiterated Malaysia's stand that the 
arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims be lifted as they did not 
have any weapons with them. 
  Our call for the lifting of the arms embargo only applies to 
Bosnia as the people in Bosnia did not have any weapons to 
defend themselves, he said.
