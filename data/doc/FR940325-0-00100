Assessment Plan_content. 



(a)***

(2) The Assessment Plan shall be of sufficient detail to serve as a means of evaluating whether the approach used for
assessing the damage is likely to be cost-effective and meets the definition of reasonable cost, as those terms are
used in this part. The Assessment Plan shall include descriptions of the natural resources and the geographical areas
involved. The Assessment Plan shall also include a statement of the authority for asserting trusteeship, or co-trusteeship,
for those natural resources considered within the Assessment Plan. The authorized official's statement of the authority
for asserting trusteeship shall not have the force and effect of a rebuttable presumption under 11.91(c) of
this part. In addition, for type B assessments, the Assessment Plan shall include the sampling locations within those
geographical areas, sample and survey design, numbers and types of samples to be collected, analyses to be performed,
preliminary determination of the recovery period, and other such information required to perform the selected methodologies.
