TOM FOGERTY; ROCK GROUP CO-FOUNDER 
Tom Fogerty, co-founder with his younger brother John of the highly successful 
1960s rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival, has died in Scottsdale, Ariz., a 
spokeswoman for his record company said Friday. He was 48. 
Terri Hinte, of Berkeley-based Fantasy Records, said Fogerty died Sept. 6 of 
respiratory failure stemming from tuberculosis. 
The Fogerty brothers began playing music as junior high school students in El 
Cerrito, in Northern California. Their band used the names Tommy Fogerty and 
the Blue Velvets, Golliwogs and, ultimately, Creedence Clearwater Revival. 
The foursome sold more than 86 million records, with eight Top 10 singles and 
six gold albums. Among their hits were "Proud Mary," "Bad Moon Rising," 
"Travelin' Band" and "Green River." 
Tom Fogerty, the rhythm guitarist, left the band in February, 1971, saying he 
wanted to spend more time with his wife and children in Arizona. 
The remaining members -- lead singer and guitarist John Fogerty, bassist Stu 
Cook and drummer Doug Clifford -- continued as a trio until disbanding in 
October, 1972. 
Tom later worked as a solo artist, recording the single "Joyful Resurrection" 
and several albums. 
Fogerty is survived by his wife, Tricia, six children and four brothers.
