FT  22 FEB 92 / Global economy liable to favour bonds over equities
'THE GLOBAL economic environment to the end of 1992 is, on balance, likely
to favour bonds over equities, but with special situations in equity markets
 -the UK market being one,' says Mr George Magnus, a director of economic
research at Warburg Securities in London.
He expects European bond markets to fare best. 'After mid-year, German
interest rates could begin a protracted decline into 1993, allowing interest
rates everywhere to fall into line with demand and inflation conditions.
Gilt yields are forecast to fall to 8.5 to 8.75 per cent. French and Ecu
bonds should also perform well while Spain and Italy will remain
interesting.'
Mr Magnus believes equity markets should be supported by lower bond yields
and inflation. 'But we single out the UK and Pacific Rim markets for value
and earnings potential, respectively.' He says the FT-SE is cheap and may
not have adjusted yet to the prospect of permanently low inflation. In
Europe, French equities look most interesting.
