CATTLE HERD REPORT HURTS FUTURES PRICES 
A government report showing a larger-than-expected U.S. cattle herd knocked 
cattle futures prices to the mat Thursday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 
but analysts were skeptical of the report's accuracy. 
On other markets, cotton futures prices fell sharply, grains and soybeans were 
mixed, precious metals futures declined, and energy futures were mixed. 
Prices for all cattle futures except the February live cattle contract plunged 
the permitted daily limit of 1 1/2 cents at the opening bell and stayed 
limit-down for the rest of the session. The contract for February delivery of 
live cattle settled 1.40 cents lower at 73.97 cents a pound while the 
near-month feeder cattle contract, for delivery in March, settled at 82.92 
cents a pound. 
Pork futures prices fell in sympathy with the cattle market. Live hogs finished 
.50 cent to 1.05 cents lower with February at 41.90 cents a pound; frozen pork 
bellies were .12 cent to 1.13 cents lower with February at 37.57 cents a pound. 
The sell-off was triggered by Wednesday's semiannual USDA cattle inventory 
report, a head count of the nation's cattle herd. The USDA reported that there 
were 99.5 million cattle and calves in the United States as of Jan. 1, only a 
few thousand fewer than the previous year. 
The industry consensus expectation was for the herd to total fewer than 98 
million cattle. The USDA report implied that after 6 years of thinning cattle 
numbers, producers were starting to rebuild their herds. 
But many analysts said they did not believe the report, especially its 
implication of an extremely high birth rate in the second half of 1988.
