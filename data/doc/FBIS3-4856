  [Text] Hiroshima, March 2 KYODO -- A prominent business 
leader said Wednesday [2 March] that the business community is 
not in a position to comment on a proposed cabinet reshuffle. 
  Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren), said a reorganization of the cabinet 
and a Diet dissolution "are the rights given to the prime 
minister," and any move is up to Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa. 
  "We are not in a position to comment on it," Hiraiwa said at 
a press conference in Hiroshima in western Japan. 
  As for the state of the economy, Hiraiwa said he has an 
impression that the economic situation has been changing a bit 
since the start of this year. He noted that he expects the 
economy to improve following progress in corporate restructuring. 
  Hiraiwa was asked for his comment on the Bank of Japan's 
latest quarterly survey of business sentiment released Tuesday 
that indicated a halt in the nine-month deterioration in the 
business outlook. 
  Hiraiwa said, however, that a stronger yen could be a drag 
on 
economic recovery and warned that Japanese companies would be in 
trouble if the yen strengthens any further.
