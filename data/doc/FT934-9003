FT  12 NOV 93 / Electricity companies cleared of anti-competitive behaviour
ELECTRICITY distributors in England and Wales were cleared of
anti-competitive behaviour in the high street electrical goods market
yesterday.
But the twin rulings by the Office of Fair Trading and Offer, the
electricity regulator, included a disclosure that the 12 regional
electricity companies (Recs) had lost a combined Pounds 105m in that market
over the three years since privatisation.
Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer, which brought the complaint
that triggered yesterday's rulings, said it felt its complaint was
vindicated by these figures, even though the charge of anti-competitive
behaviour was not upheld. 'We are very pleased that the facts are now out in
the public domain and that shareholders can see for themselves what is going
on,' said Mr Mark Souhami, Dixons deputy chairman.
Dixons had complained that Recs had maintained lossmaking retail activities
by cross-subsidising them from the electricity supply and distribution
businesses.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, said he accepted
that the activities were lossmaking. 'But I have concluded that no Rec is
significant enough to command market power. It is most unlikely that any Rec
could contemplate a strategy aimed at ousting from the market such
well-established competitors as Dixons and then recouping its losses out of
higher retail prices.'
Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, said that while
the Recs had made losses and earned very low returns on their retail
businesses, this 'does not in itself mean that they are being
cross-subsidised by the regulated businesses. Electricity prices and profits
are not higher as a result of retail losses than they otherwise would have
been.'
He added that the losses would be borne by the shareholders, and it was a
matter for them whether it was commercially sensible to incur them.
