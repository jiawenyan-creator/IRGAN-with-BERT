  [Text] Baghdad, 8 May (INA)--The AL-THAWRAH newspaper has 
said our Kurdish people are the principal losers in the bloody 
clashes taking place between the Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal 
Talabani groups in northern Iraq. The newspaper, the mouthpiece 
of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, says in an article today that 
our people have been afflicted by these agents, servants of 
foreigners, and other criminals and highwaymen. 
  The newspaper adds: Current events in northern Iraq are 
taking place under foreign interference in Iraq's domestic 
affairs and in the absence of a central authority, which can run 
the affairs of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region, which enjoyed 
prosperity before the 30-state aggression. 
  The newspaper says that as a result of the current situation 
in northern Iraq, our Kurish people have won nothing but hunger, 
death, destruction, displacement, the absence of security, and 
the stealing and smuggling of the property of the state and the 
people, and that the region has become a fertile ground for 
terrorists, foreigners, and Zionist and foreign espionage 
networks. 
  The paper adds that Iraq has several times warned against 
foreign interference, but there are people who enjoy living 
under the bayonets of the United States and other sides, who 
want to serve foreigners at the expense of their brothers, and 
who tamper with the people's security in the Kurdistan 
Autonomous Region. 
  The paper stresses that due to foreign interference in 
domestic affairs, the situation in northern Iraq has become very 
bad. 
  The newspaper says established historical and geographic 
facts for thousands of years, as well as the real feelings of 
the sons of our Kurdish people in northern Iraq, indicate that 
the future is a for strong, unified Iraq under the leadership of 
President Saddam Husayn. 
  The paper says that all the conspiracies of the Zionist 
enemies and the servants of foreigners will go to waste, and 
history will remember the positions of the men who defended 
national unity and Iraq's honor. 
  Concluding, the paper says history will have no mercy on 
those who remain outside the national ranks and who carry 
weapons to harm Iraq's unity and serve foreigners.
