  [Abstract] A problem in recording, with a receiver on 
ground, the heat radiated by turbulent jets of gaseous molecular 
combustion products in space upon its passage through a 
turbulent atmosphere is the effect of atmospheric fluctuations 
on readings. This effect is evaluated theoretically on the basis 
of the Reardon multigroup model by a method which takes into 
account the contribution of ``hot'' lines. In that model lines 
within some region of the spectrum are replaced with groups of 
lines differing only in their excitation energy levels, which 
are multiples of the ground-state vibrational quantum in 
molecules of the gas. The mean radiation intensity within a 
finite range of the spectral band characterizing the gas is, in 
the case of Lorentz broadening of spectral lines, calculated by 
representing the one-point probability density distribution 
functions as superpositions of three -functions. Such 
calculations have been made for a jet of a gaseous 
H[.sub]2[/]O + CO[.sub]2[/] + CO mixture with the 
respective partial pressures 0.041 atm, 0.033 atm, 0.003 atm and 
the temperature 850 K at the throat of a 20 cm in diameter 
nozzle. The results indicate that in the case of H[.sub]2[/] 
and CO[.sub]2[/] combustion products turbulent atmospheric 
temperature and density fluctuations must be accounted for in 
the Wien region of the radiation spectrum. The effect of these 
fluctuations on the emitted radiation is strongest where their 
amplitude is largest and where the jet temperature is 
approximately twice the ambient one, typically at the jet edges 
and in the transition segment. Tables 3; references 25.
