FT  18 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Banana trade talks go to the wire
Negotiations over a Latin American assault on the European Union's
controversial banana import regime are expected to continue today, with
Latin American negotiators at odds with each other, and the European
Commission alarmed that a breakdown will result in publication of a report
damning its preferential trading arrangements with former colonies.
Four of five Latin American banana exporters who brought a complaint against
the EU banana import regime to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
last year agreed at a key meeting in Costa Rica last Thursday to bow to
intense Union pressure to accept Europe's proposed new banana import regime.
However, the fifth - Guatemala - remains resolutely opposed to a settlement.
It has won backing from Ecuador, Panama and Honduras, which are important
banana exporters, but feel they have been sold short in a proposed European
compromise because they are not members of Gatt.
Consensus among the four Latin American countries willing to accept the EU
compromise - Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Venezuela - appeared
fragile late yesterday, as it was reported that Nicaragua was unhappy that
Costa Rica and Colombia were the main beneficiaries of compromise.
The Latin Americans were warned in a letter signed by three EU commissioners
last week that the Union's new quota offer would not be improved, and would
be withdrawn if it was not accepted before a Gatt panel report on the Latin
American complaint is published.
Gatt officials yesterday agreed to delay release of the report to this
evening, two days after the deadline for publication, in an effort to allow
negotiators to reach a compromise.
