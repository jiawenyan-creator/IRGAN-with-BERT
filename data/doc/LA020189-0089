BRIEFLY 
Eastern Airlines rejected binding arbitration in the 16-month-old contract 
dispute with its largest union. The National Mediation Board began mediating 
the Eastern-Machinists talks a year ago. Under its rules, the refusal of one of 
the parties to submit to binding arbitration will lead to declaration of an 
impasse. That triggers a 30-day "cooling-off period." If there is no 
settlement, the union may strike and the company may impose its own work 
conditions on the union employees.
