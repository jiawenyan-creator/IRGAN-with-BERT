  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 31 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi 
Hoe-chang said Monday that neither military tension on the 
Korean peninsula nor North Korean military threats to the South 
has risen. 
  He told a luncheon meeting with journalists that the 
deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea is still under 
consultation between Seoul and Washington. "It has not been 
decided," he said. 
  Yi said that recent reports on the deployment of U.S. Apache 
helicopters and an aircraft carrier in South Korea and on 
reinforcement of U.S. intelligence units here are not true or 
exaggeration of facts. 
  He also said that he plans to organize a committee with 16 
specialists in various fields to push ahead with inter- 
nationalization of the country. 
  "The committee will be divided into several subcommittees to 
study measures for internationalization," he said.
