  [Text] Beijing, 11 May (XINHUA) -- A get-together was held 
in Beijing to mark 1994 International Family Year. 
  Wang Shoudao, Li Desheng, Chen Xilian, Wang Enmao, and other 
revolutionaries of the older generation, as well as people from 
all walks of life in Beijing, attended the get-together. 
  The 44th UN General Assembly passed a resolution in 1989 
proclaiming 1994 as "International Family Year," and designating 
15 May of each year thereafter as "International Family Day." 
  Speaking at the get-together, Wang Shoudao said: Families 
are basic units in society, and they should be allowed to play a 
role in social development and progress. Our country cannot 
carry out its socialist modernization drive without the efforts 
of each and every family. He noted: We should promote the 
Chinese nation's fine tradition of respecting the old and 
cherishing the young, build closer generational ties within the 
family, and promote familial harmony. We should improve the 
family's functions of caring for the elderly, and take better 
care of and provide for old people so that they will spend their 
remaining years peacefully. The elderly should educate the 
younger generation, impart their experiences, and make more 
contributions to social development. 
  Wang Zhaohua, chairman of the China National Committee on 
Aging, also spoke at the get-together. 
  Entertainment workers staged brilliant theatrical 
performances at the get-together. 
  The get-together was sponsored by the China National 
Committee on Aging and organized by the Hualing Publishing House 
and the Beijing Mass Information Center.
