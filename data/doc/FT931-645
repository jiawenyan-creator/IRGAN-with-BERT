FT  29 MAR 93 / Ashdown firm on electoral reform
LABOUR'S attitude to electoral reform will be the single most important
litmus test of its views on modernising Britain, Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal
Democrat leader, said yesterday.
His comments came ahead of the publication, expected this week, of Labour's
report on electoral reform, which is believed to favour a form of
proportional representation.
