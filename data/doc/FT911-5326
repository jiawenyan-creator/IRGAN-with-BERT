FT  15 APR 91 / Letter: NEDC report to consider tax on company parking
Sir, Can I assure Mr Addison ('NEDC conclusion is not the answer to
congestion', Letters, April 11) that the National Economic Development
Council traffic management systems working party, has indeed taken on board
his suggestion for improving London's traffic flow.
Our final report will include road layout factors as well as enforcement
issues, public transport, the use of technology and economic factors. The
last will cover, among many others, the possible taxation of the provision
of a company-provided car parking space.
The last Budget introduced the taxation of a company-provided car telephone,
so why not a company-provided car parking space?
Finally, I don't know if the NEDC is 'the originator of the largest number
of proposals that have not been accepted by any government', but in most
cases our target audience is not government but companies, that do act on
them.
