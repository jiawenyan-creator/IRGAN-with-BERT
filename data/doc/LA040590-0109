John Griffin, who left the college coaching ranks four years ago for Wall 
Street, was named basketball coach at St. Joseph's College, Pa., his alma 
mater. 
Griffin, 33, a 1978 St. Joseph's graduate, replaces Jim Boyle, who announced in 
December he would step down after nine years as head coach. The Hawks finished 
with a 7-21 record last season, the worst in school history. 
Griffin coached Siena to a 21-8 record in 1985-86, then left coaching to become 
an investment broker.
