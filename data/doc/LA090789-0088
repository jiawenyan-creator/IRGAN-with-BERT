SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRANSFERS OF 8 STUDENTS OKD 
A Los Angeles judge ruled Wednesday that the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified 
School District could allow eight students to transfer from Miraleste High 
School to Rolling Hills High. 
Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel said the district did not technically violate 
her 1988 ruling prohibiting it from closing Miraleste or transferring any 
east-side students to west-side schools until it completes an environmental 
impact report on school closures districtwide. 
The district, which decided in 1987 to close Miraleste because of declining 
enrollment, is preparing the report. 
The transfers were challenged by the East Peninsula Education Council, the 
parents group that seeks to split the district and keep Miraleste open. The 
group filed a legal motion that sought to have the district found in contempt 
for allowing the transfers to occur. 
District officials said the eight students live closer to Rolling Hills High 
than to Miraleste. They said that even if the parents prevailed and a second 
school district were formed on the peninsula, those areas would remain part of 
the existing district. 
Vogel also ruled that any future disputes between the parents group and the 
district should be resolved before her on an informal basis.
