I. Regulatory History



OSHA has regulated asbestos several times as more information has become available. Asbestos rulemakings marked
the early years of the Agency. A 12 f/cc permissible exposure limit (PEL) for asbestos was included in the initial promulgation
on May 29, 1971 (36 FR 10466) of OSHA standards pursuant to Section 6(a) of the Act. In response to a petition by the Industrial
Union Department of the AFL-CIO, OSHA issued an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) on asbestos on December 7, 1971,
which established a PEL of 5 f/cc as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) and a peak exposure level of 10 f/cc. 

In June 1972, OSHA promulgated a new final standard that established an 8-hour TWA PEL of 5 f/cc and a ceiling limit of
10 f/cc. These limits were intended primarily to protect employees against asbestosis, and it was hoped that they
would provide some incidental degree of protection against asbestos induced forms of cancer. Effective July 1976,
OSHA's 8-hour TWA limit was reduced to 2 f/cc and this limit remained in effect up to the effective date of the revised
1986 standards. 

In October 1975, OSHA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (40 FR 47652) to revise the asbestos standard because
the Agency believed that ``sufficient medical and scientific evidence has been accumulated to warrant the designation
of asbestos as a human carcinogen'' and that advances in monitoring and protective technology made re-examination
of the standard ``desirable.'' This proposal would have reduced the 8-hour TWA to 0.5 f/cc and imposed a ceiling limit
of 5 f/cc for 15 minutes. The 1975 proposal would have applied to all industries except construction. 

At that time no separate proposal applicable to the construction industry was developed by the Agency. 

On May 24, 1983 OSHA consulted with the Advisory Committee for Construction Safety and Health (``ACCSH'') concerning
the applicability of any new asbestos standard to the construction industry. ACCSH endorsed OSHA's position that
any new PEL adopted for general industry should also apply to the construction industry (Ex. 84424). 

On November 4, 1983 OSHA published an ETS for asbestos (48 FR 51096). The ETS marked a new regulatory initiative, related
to, but not part of the 1975 proceeding. The ETS was held invalid by the U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
on March 7, 1984. 

Subsequently, OSHA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (49 FR 1416, April 10, 1984) for a standard covering
occupational exposure to asbestos in all work places subject to the Act. Pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act, the ETS
also served as a proposed rule. On June 17, 1986, OSHA issued two revised standards, one governing occupational exposure
to asbestos in general industry workplaces, the other applicable to construction workplaces (51 FR 22612 et seq.,
June 20, 1986). Effective July 21, 1986, the revised standards amended OSHA's previous asbestos standard issued
in 1972. The 1986 standards explicitly applied to occupational exposure to non-asbestiform tremolite, anthophyllite
and actinolite. After a subsequent and separate rulemaking proceeding OSHA has deleted these minerals from the scope
of the asbestos standards. (57 FR 24310, June 8, 1992).
