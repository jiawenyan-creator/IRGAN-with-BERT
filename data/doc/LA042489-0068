MORNING REPORT: ART 
Singer Carly Simon will open an art gallery in New York on May 2 with a benefit 
exhibition featuring three of her favorite artists. Riverrun Gallery, which 
shares its name with Simon's Oscar-winning hit single, "Let the River Run," 
will donate funds from the opening to the Hazelden Foundation in Minneapolis 
and the Assn. to Benefit Children in New York. Hazelden is a nonprofit drug and 
alcohol rehabilitation center; the Assn. to Benefit Children takes care of 
children who are homeless or afflicted with AIDS. The gallery is expected to 
put on four shows per year. The debut exhibition will feature artists from 
Martha's Vineyard, where Simon has a home. Claudia Puig and ALEENE MacMINN
