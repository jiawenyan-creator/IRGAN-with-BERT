P.M. BRIEFING; 
EX-DEFENSE SECRETARY WILL BECOME DIRECTOR OF 4TH DEFENSE CONTRACTOR 
Former Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci will become a director of Kaman 
Corp., a defense and industrial hardware supplier when he is approved by the 
board later this month, the firm announced today. Since leaving office Carlucci 
has joined the boards of three other government contractors. 
Kaman's board will vote on Carlucci's nomination at its next meeting Feb. 28, 
said Kaman spokesman J. Kenneth Nasshan. Carlucci stepped down as defense 
secretary when President Ronald Reagan left office Jan. 20, ending a 30-year 
career in government. He recently took a job in the Washington office of the 
Carlyle Group, a merchant banking and investment firm. 
The spokesman denied that Carlucci was sought for whatever influence he may 
have with the Pentagon. "Everyone understands what federal laws and guidelines 
allow," Nasshan said. 
Since leaving government service, Carlucci has been named to the boards of 
Westinghouse Electric Corp., Ashland Oil Inc. and Bell Atlantic Corp., all 
government contractors. Kaman's outside directors receive annual retainers of 
$10,000, plus fees of $600 for each meeting they attend.
