FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: Chief rose from lab assistant
DAVID BARNES, who will become chief executive of ICI Bio after the demerger,
joined ICI as a laboratory assistant in 1957 after graduating from Liverpool
University. His first job was in the new pharmaceutical research centre at
Alderley Park, Cheshire.
He interrupted his ICI career for a period of National Service in the Royal
Artillery, where he saw active service in the Malayan emergency. Mr Barnes
rejoined ICI Pharmaceuticals in the overseas sales department and in 1971
became the drugs division's youngest director at 34.
Mr Barnes, 56, left pharmaceuticals in 1983 to head ICI Paints, where he
initiated international expansions culminating in the purchase of Glidden
Paint in the US.
He joined the main board in 1986, with responsibility for drugs, explosives
and agrochemicals. Highly regarded by his colleagues, he is considered a
possible successor to Sir Denys Henderson as chairman.
Mr Barnes is a non-executive director of Thorn EMI.
