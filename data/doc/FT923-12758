FT  17 JUL 92 / Technology: Blueprints go on the record - Worth Watching
Blueprints used during the building of a plant are notoriously inaccurate
because design changes made during construction are seldom recorded.
This means that when the time comes for maintenance and repairs, or the
addition of new buildings and equipment, it is often necessary to measure
and re-draw the plant and equipment - which is both time-consuming and
costly.
But Blom, a Norwegian company, has developed a software program which
converts photographs of a plant into up-to-date engineering drawings. First
the plant and equipment is marked and systematically photographed.
Then the images are processed and, using the marks as anchor points, an
accurate three-dimensional engineering database is generated. Blom: Norway,
