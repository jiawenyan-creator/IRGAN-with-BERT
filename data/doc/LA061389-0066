Thomas W. Gamel said that Hollywood Park has agreed to turn over a list of its 
shareholders. Gamel had sued to obtain the list, which he hopes to use to gain 
support for a proposal to convert the race track to other uses. 
Gamel, who has a 5.6% share in Hollywood Park stock, has proposed that the 
340-acre site be converted to an off-track betting facility or a football 
stadium.
