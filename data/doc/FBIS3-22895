Necessary"] 
  [Excerpt] Braunlage, 16 March -- Heinrich von Pierer, 
chairman of the board of directors of Siemens AG, has suggested 
German-French cooperation in reequipping nuclear power plants in 
the CIS. The condition of the Soviet-type facilities is 
alarming, Pierer said at the RWE [Rheinisch-Westfaelisches 
Elektrizitaetswerk] "Energy" Workshop in Braunlage. The safety 
standard is low and, in addition, the importance of safety is 
judged differently than in Western Europe. In some places, 
reactors are kept on line even though safety problems would 
require a shutdown. In addition, spare parts are missing and 
the operating crews are often unmotivated. Due to the 
geographic closeness, the European neighbors must be interested 
in improving the power plants, Pierer said. 
  A German-French alliance could form the core of a European 
initiative -- for instance, together with the Swedes and the 
Finnish -- in order to provide financial and technical "help for 
self-help" to the CIS. Some nuclear power plants must be closed 
down for good and, therefore, replacements must be established. 
Pierer said that in this connection, he is primarily thinking 
of the new construction of conventional gas power plants. In 
Central and Eastern Europe, there are still 58 Soviet-type 
nuclear power plants in operation at the moment, 15 of them are 
of the Chernobyl type. The Siemens director estimates the costs 
for reequipment at 12-14 billion German marks. However, 
equipment for only 4 billion marks would have to be imported; 
the large remaining part could come from CIS production.
