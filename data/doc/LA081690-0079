VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME; 
RESIDENTS' PETITION PROTESTS TENT JAIL 
Homeowners opposed to construction of a tent jail for drug users at the Navy 
base in Port Hueneme have sent a petition with 764 signatures protesting the 
project to the base commander. 
Capt. R.J. Pearson III, commander of the Naval Construction Battalion Center, 
received the petition, spokeswoman Connie Taylor said. 
"Our position is that the proposal is under study," she said, and a decision on 
the jail will be made in Washington. 
Copies of the petition were sent to the Ventura County Sheriff's Department and 
to County Supervisor John K. Flynn, said Mary Conklin, a member of the 
Concerned Citizens Committee. 
The temporary jail was proposed by Sheriff John V. Gillespie as a way to 
provide space for as many as 320 minor drug offenders who would be housed in 
four large tents. 
Earlier this month, the County Board of Supervisors voted to ask the U.S. 
Department of Justice for $7.2 million to launch the project. 
Members of the committee that circulated the petition say they are concerned 
about the jail's closeness to houses and three elementary schools. GERRY BRAILO
