Johnson Matthey, the precious metals technology group, is to build a Pounds
6m autocatalyst plant in Malaysia as a joint venture with Hicom, the
Malaysian government's industrial investment company.
The plant is part of JM's plan to increase its penetration of the rapidly
growing south-east Asian market, and follows the opening of a Pounds 25m
technical centre in Japan in October.
It will produce up to 1m autocatalysts, which reduce engine pollution, a
year.
