FT  15 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: The dollar dilemma
SEVEN WEEKS into 1993, it is extraordinary how much uncertainty there still
is about the outlook for the dollar and the US economy, writes James Blitz.
Throughout the second half of last year, markets waited for signs of a
strong upturn in the US economy, believing that this would push the dollar
firmly upwards.
Expectations of recovery have helped to push the dollar up by nearly 30
pfennigs against the D-Mark in the last five months. But dealers are still
wondering whether the currency can go higher than DM1.67.
In its global currency outlook, NatWest Markets in London forecasts a
D-Mark/dollar rate of DM1.82 in 12 months time, well above the forward
market rate of DM1.70. Although doubts still surround the scale of the US
economic recovery, the group still expects the upward trend to remain intact
throughout the year.
However, other commentators are less sure. Last Thursday's figure for M2
money supply growth for the first week of February showed only a 0.6 per
cent increase year-on-year, a new low in the current US economic cycle.
According to Mr Mark Brett, of BZW in London, this should make dollar bulls
think again about whether the recovery is as strong as believed.
At a presentation in London last week, Mr Philip Braverman, Chief Economist
at DKB Securities in New York, was also very uncertain about whether the US
would stage a strong recovery this year.
'The US economy's essential condition over coming quarters will be slower
growth, persistent economic and financial distress, and eroding inflation,'
he said. 'That reality should produce new lows in interest rates.
The December leading indicators, due out tomorrow, will give new clues to
the economy's strength. But President Bill Clinton's State of the Union
address tomorrow will be scrutinised for his thinking on the budget deficit.
