  [Text] Security sources said yesterday that the 
booby-trapped car that blew up in 'Afula was assembled by 
experts. They believe the terrorist who was killed in the blast 
did not assemble the car bomb but was merely a suicide driver. 
  The sources added that this type of booby-trapped car is 
used 
by Hizballah. Therefore, it may very well be that the gang that 
assembled the bomb used the know-how acquired by the Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] activists who were deported to 
Lebanon in December 1992 and who returned to the territories a 
few months ago. The sources pointed out that the deportees, who 
spent a year at the Marj al-Zuhur encampment, were trained in 
the preparation of bombs and booby-trapped cars by Hizballah 
experts and Iranian elements.
