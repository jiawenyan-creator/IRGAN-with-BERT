GAY'S SUIT AGAINST BOY SCOUTS 
In response to "Boy Scout Question," editorial (Sept. 24): 
Your editorial on gays becoming Scout leaders was remarkable. 
The public, in general, must break away from these fears of homosexuals. They 
are only different in their choice of a companion. 
It is truly sad that Curran has to go through the courts to become a Scout 
leader. This should prove to the courts that this man cares and wants to help 
mold minds in a proper way, not in a sexual way.
