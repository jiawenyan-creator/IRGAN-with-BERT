  [Text] Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, press spokesman for the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], has said that there is no need 
to postpone local government elections. He has described as a 
political game the president's announcement that he will veto 
the local government electoral law unless the coalition agrees 
to a postponement of the local government elections until next 
year. 
  [Begin Siemiatkowski recording] Delaying the elections means 
that 1995 would be dominated only by elections. Let me point 
out that we think the presidential elections and a referendum 
approving the Constitution must be held in 1995. 
  Adding the local government elections to these would result 
in a situation where we would not have time in Poland for 
anything but elections. The president, by bringing about this 
situation and moving the constitutional deadlines connected with 
elections, is creating a very dangerous precedent. We can start 
discussing the duration of other terms in office in Poland that 
could perhaps be cut short or extended. [end recording] 
  SLD leader Aleksander Kwasniewski has said that he does not 
understand the president's motives. According to Kwasniewski, 
Poland needs a stable political calendar; hence, the local 
government elections should be held on the dates already fixed.
