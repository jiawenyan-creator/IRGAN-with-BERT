FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Half of BZW staff may be moved to Canary
Wharf
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking subsidiary of Barclays,
yesterday told its 3,500 staff that more than half of them were likely to be
relocated to Canary Wharf in East London.
In an internal memorandum, it told employees that it was in negotiations to
rent two trading floors, or about 500,000 sq ft of space.
The deal would be a boost for the east London property development, which
was refinanced by its banks last year and came out of administration. It was
built by the Canadian developer, Mr Paul Reichmann, at the turn of the
decade.
BZW's decision to reconsider Canary Wharf will surprise many in the City,
because only last month it was widely reported that it had decided not to
move there.
However, Mr Martin Taylor, Barclay's chief executive, said the previous
decision was that the whole of BZW should not move so far from the City.
However, there was a strong case for moving staff to Canary Wharf who did
not need to meet clients regularly.
Among departments likely to move are: markets, which include bond, foreign
exchange and money market trading, and debt capital markets, which combines
the creation and trading of derivative products.
The firm's corporate finance and equity departments are likely to remain
closer to the City. They are expected to occupy Royal Mint Court, the
refurbished eighteenth century building already occupied by Barclays' senior
management.
Mr Taylor said that the decision of where to house the investment banking
firm was one of the most difficult he had faced since joining the bank last
year.
Barclays was one of the main lenders to Canary Wharf and has suffered
significant losses on its loans to the project.
