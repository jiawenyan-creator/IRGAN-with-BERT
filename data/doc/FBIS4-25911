  [Text] Washington, June 15 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton announced here that the United States was beginning 
formal discussions today at the United Nations about a sanction 
resolution against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
(DPRK). 
  "We are going to be very deliberate, very firm," Clinton 
told 
reporters at the White House before meeting with bipartisan 
congressional leaders. 
  He said that the proposed resolution would "include phased 
sanctions designed to deal not only with the actions of the 
North Koreans to date, but as a deterrent to future constructive 
conduct with regard to the IAEA (International Atomic Energy 
Agency) and the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty) [Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty]." 
  "I feel that we are pursuing the proper course at this 
time," 
the President claimed. 
  Asked what he hopes for former President Jimmy Carter's 
meetings with the DPRK leaders, Clinton said he is more hopeful 
that Carter "will get a better sense from them about where they 
are and that they will understand that we're very firm in our 
position." 
  But "there is an alternative path and a very good one for 
North Korea," Clinton also said, "They don't have to become more 
isolated; they could become more engaged in the world in ways 
that would be much better for their own people."
