The Department shall determine, and Customs shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual
differences between USP and FMV may vary from the percentages stated above. The Department will issue appraisement
instructions directly to Customs. 
Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of these final results of administrative
review for all shipments of silicon metal from Brazil entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or
after the publication date, as provided by Section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, and will remain in effect until the
final results of the next administrative review: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed companies will be those
listed above, (2) for previously investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit will continue to be the
company-specific rate published for the most recent period, (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review,
or the original investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the
most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise, and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers
or exporters will be the ``all others'' rate established in the final notice of the LTFV investigation of this case,
in accordance with the CIT's decisions in Floral Trade Council v. United States, 

Slip Op. 9379 (CIT May 25, 1993), and 

Federal Mogul Corporation and Torrington Company v. United States, 

Slip. Op. 9383 (CIT May 25, 1993). The all others rate is 91.06 percent. These deposit requirements, when imposed,
shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. 
This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 
This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibility
concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d).
Timely written notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order
is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation. 
This administrative review and notice are in accordance with Section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22 (1993).
