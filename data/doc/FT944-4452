FT  08 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pain or privileges control?
Sir, I was in New York on Sunday October 30, a warm, sunny, delightful day,
and visited New York's Central Park Zoo. In due course I paid a call to the
ladies' loo and I record a vignette of NY life below.
A mother, with pram and a three to four-year-old child in it, repeated and
repeated 'stop that, stop that' as the child in a tantrum continued to kick
the wall with its feet. Finally, in desperation, the mother said: 'If you
don't stop that, I'll take all your privileges away.'
The recent publicity about the UK's child minders brought this scene to the
forefront of my mind. Will the child connect her loss of privileges with her
behaviour in the ladies' loo at the Central Park Zoo?
Perhaps the mother would have taken more striking action if there had not
been two witnesses.
