FT  18 AUG 92 / Tube staff may face tests for drugs
THOUSANDS OF London Underground staff face random tests for drugs and
alcohol abuse if discussions between rail unions and the railway can
establish a cost-effective procedure for testing.
Under legislation due to come into effect next month, London Underground has
a responsibility to take measures to ensure that staff holding a range of
jobs crucial to safety, such as train drivers, are fit for duty and not
under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The law will give the police the
power to test safety-critical staff who they believe are behaving
erratically or who have been involved in a dangerous or potentially
dangerous incident.
London Underground be-lieves unannounced checks on staff whose names would
be drawn at random, or on staff at specific locations, is the fairest
testing system. The management would like to see the procedure include staff
who are not specified by the law, such as lift and escalator operators, who
it believes are equally crucial to safety.
London Underground said it was sure there was no widespread problem 'but
obviously we want to make sure there is not going to be one'.
An obstacle to random testing is the cost of arranging cover for those
called in to take them.
The unions are not opposed to the principle of testing, but they do not
believe the system is necessary for London Underground to meet its legal
obligation. They say that British Rail, which will be bound by the same
legislation, is not considering random testing.
The unions want safeguards against abuse by managers who, they argue, might
use tests to penalise staff. They would also like to see the tests
introduced alongside preventative and educational programmes.
