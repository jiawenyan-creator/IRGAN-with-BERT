FT  01 NOV 94 / Polish minister thinks again
Poland's foreign minister, Mr Andrzej Olechowski, who resigned last week
after being placed on a list of top government officials who also hold
directorships, has suspended his resignation while the courts clarify if he
was breaking the law. Asked in a newspaper interview what he would do if the
courts decided against him or the issue was not clarified by the end of the
year, he replied: 'I will leave.' The list of 68 senior officials was
published last week by Mr Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, justice minister, who
argued that they contravened a 1981 law banning government officials from
accepting pay from other sources. Mr Olechowski, who was nominated by
President Lech Walesa, has also denied that he will run against him in next
year's presidential election.
