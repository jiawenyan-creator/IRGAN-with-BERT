  [Text] Moscow, 31 Mar -- Questions of bilateral cooperation 
and solving difficult problems were the subject of discussion at 
a meeting today between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
and Poland's Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy. 
  Lately, there has been a big upsurge in Russian-Polish 
top-level contacts, Kozyrev said after the meeting. However, 
the Polish press at times carries irresponsible unofficial 
statements that clearly do not help to strengthen bilateral 
relations. The minister expressed the hope that the talks in 
Moscow between the members of the Polish parliamentary 
delegation and Russian parliamentarians and representatives of 
executive power would lead to the elimination of certain 
distortions.
