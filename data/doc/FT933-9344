FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bass sells pubs to Greene King
Bass has sold 44 pubs, mainly in London and Surrey, to Greene King, the
regional brewer, for Pounds 17.5m cash.
The acquisition will increase the size of Greene King's estate to 870 pubs
and should be earnings-enhancing in the current year, Mr Tim Bridge, Greene
King's managing director, said yesterday.
'The properties are positioned within our strategic development area and
will make a significant positive impact on the managed house proportion of
our estate,' he added.
Greene King will take over the pubs gradually through next month, placing
most of them under management rather than tenancies.
