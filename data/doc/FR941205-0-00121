ACTION:

 Final rule.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is promulgating the use of several new analytical 
methods and updated versions of previously approved methods for a 
number of regulated contaminants in drinking water. At the same 
time, the Agency is withdrawing approval of outdated methods or 
outdated versions of the same methods. The purpose of the rule 
is to approve new methods, withdraw outdated methods, and update 
older methods for analysis of regulated contaminants in drinking 
water. The rule is expected to eliminate unnecessary duplication 
by withdrawing older versions of the same method, and satisfy 
public requests for approval of new technologies in drinking 
water analyses.
