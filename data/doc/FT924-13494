FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Norwegian savings groups will be
back in black this year, report says
NORWAY'S savings banks will return to profits this year and remain in the
black until the end of 1995, following two years of losses, the Savings
Banks Association said yesterday. The 130 banks, however, will see zero
growth in loan volume in 1992 and 1993, largely due to competition from
heavily-subsidised commercial banks.
The association says the savings banks will post a combined net profit of
NKr620m (Dollars 103.33m) this year compared with a loss of NKr1.827bn in
1991 - their worst during the last five years - and a loss of NKr1.082bn in
1990.
Combined profits will rise further to NKr1.280bn in 1993, NKr1.430bn in 1994
and NKr1.915bn in 1995, it adds.
Last year, the state injected an estimated NKr18bn into the banking sector,
but the savings banks received just NKr2.5bn.
The association argues the commercial banks, because of state subsidies, can
offer more competitive terms than the non-subsidised savings banks.
Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank last year collapsed into the hands of the
state which has since remained their owner. Christiania has warned it needs
a further state injection of NKr2.05bn and Fokus Bank has said it needs
NKr650m in order to meet new capital adequacy regulations.
The association said the government should end free subsidisation of the
commercial banks.
Sparebanken Nord-Norge, the third-largest savings bank, bounced back into
the black in the first eight months of this year with a pre-tax profit of
NKr112.1m compared with a loss of NKr41.3m in the same period last year.
Credit losses were cut to NKr188.1m from NKr359.7m, and costs slashed to
NKr463.7m from NKr700.6m.
