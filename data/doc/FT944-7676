FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (6): The economy is remarkably resilient -
A decade of economic restructuring is bearing fruit
The Mexican economy has shown impressive resilience during a jittery
election year which began with a peasant rebellion in Chiapas, was followed
by the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI presidential
candidate, in March, continued with two damaging banking scandals and a
heightened perception of the menace posed by Mexico's drug barons, who may
have had a hand in the murder of the PRI secretary-general, Mr Jose
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, in September.
It has taken considerable skill to neutralise such sustained blows to
domestic and international confidence in Mexico's economic future.
The most visible cost to the economy has been the depletion of the country's
international reserves, which dropped from Dollars 23.02bn in October 1993
to Dollars 17.24bn last month. Much of the fall took place during the
Central Bank's attempts to defend the peso, following Mr Colosio's death.
Despite political instability, Mexico has been able to generate some
positive economic results. Gross domestic product is expected to grow by
almost three per cent this year, its best performance since 1991.
For the third year in a row there will be no fiscal deficit. Inflation in
1994 is expected to be contained below seven per cent, while an economic
pact signed between government, labour and employers in September has set an
inflation target of four per cent for 1995.
The goal may be too ambitious, but the trend of lower inflation is expected
to be maintained.
By setting such a target, the authorities have committed themselves to
continued fiscal discipline and maintaining a strong peso. Furthermore, wage
growth will be restricted to four per cent, plus productivity bonuses.
The economic restructuring that caused so much pain during the past decade
appears to be finally bearing fruit. Productivity in the manufacturing
sector is rising by about 10 per cent a year, according to government
figures, although the gains have not been uniform. The steel, cement and
capital goods sectors have adapted best to the competitive stress of a more
open trading regime, while many companies in the pulp and paper, textile and
footwear industries have gone under.
'The liberalisation of the economy has attracted much new investment, but it
has also destroyed a great deal of old capital stock,' says Mr Miguel
Mancera, governor of Mexico's newly-independent Central Bank. He believes
the shake-out of inefficient manufacturers has run its course, and that the
worst-affected sectors, such as textiles, are now back on their feet.
All this is contributing to a strong increase in manufacturing exports,
which in the first half of 1994 jumped by 20.9 per cent, and partly explains
the modest recovery in economic growth. Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the
president-elect, will inherit a balanced budget, single digit inflation and
a largely deregulated economy which many analysts believe is poised to
return to a period of stable and sustained growth.
As a former central banker and budget minister, Mr Zedillo is unlikely to
change the economic course set by the Salinas administration. But like all
new presidents, he will want to put his personal mark on economic policy.
Over the next six years, he has pledged to boost the country's lacklustre
economic growth, provide around 1m new jobs a year, improve the country's
highly unequal distribution of wealth, while maintaining low inflation and
keeping public finances in order.
Mr Zedillo has also pledged to increase public spending on infrastructure
projects by 25 per cent during his first year in office, in a tacit
admission that inefficiencies in the state-owned railways, electricity and
oil sectors have become big impediments to faster economic growth.
In an accelerating economy, however, many economists worry that imports
could grow faster than exports, widening a current account deficit that is
expected to reach Dollars 27bn in 1994, about seven per cent of GDP.
'The current account deficit is unsustainable,' says an Mr Rogelio Ramirez
de la O at the economic consultancy, Ecanal. 'It is being financed by
largely speculative foreign capital inflows which are both volatile and
sensitive to bad news. And it locks the government into maintaining high
real interest rates, which in turn puts a break on growth.'
At present, Mexico's foreign reserves (backed by a Dollars 6.7bn credit line
from the US and Canada and additional support from the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank), plus net capital inflows of some Dollars
23.5bn, are sufficient to cover Mexico's external financing gap and deter
speculation against the peso.
But some economists caution against Mexico's over-dependence on foreign
capital to finance the trade gap - 'Mexico has little control over this kind
of capital inflows,' says Mr Jonathan Heath, a consultant with Macro
Assesoria Economica.
'It depends on exogenous factors, such as US interest rates and how other
world stock markets are performing, rather than the yields on Mexican
treasury bills and the performance of the Mexican bourse.'
If political uncertainty or a widening trade gap led portfolio investors to
bale out of Mexico, the resulting pressure on the peso and interest rates
could disrupt Mr Zedillo's best-laid economic plans.
The overriding goal of the Salinas administration, which Mr Zedillo promises
to follow, has been to curb inflation to levels that approximate those in
the industrialised world. That, and a commitment to a stable exchange rate,
has severely restricted the government's room for manoeuvre in macroeconomic
policy.
The Pacto (agreement) signed in September left the daily slippage of the
peso fluctuation band unchanged, which will place an upper limit of about
five per cent on the peso's depreciation during 1995.
The incoming administration appears to have ruled out a devaluation of the
currency - which some economists consider long overdue - to stimulate
exports.
'The problem of exports will not be solved by devaluing the exchange rate,'
said Mr Zedillo, in a recent interview with El Economista, a Mexican
financial daily.
'A devaluation would not compensate for the lack of productivity,
competitiveness and adequate strategies to penetrate export markets.'
There is also the fear that a devaluation would rekindle inflation. But the
commitment to a strong peso has also kept domestic interest rates high,
leading businessmen to complain that the prohibitive cost of credit is
choking growth. They say they compete with US manufacturers when prime
lending rates are at least eight percentage points higher than those in the
US.
Mr Mancera at the Central Bank appears unwilling to use interest rates as a
policy instrument to stimulate growth.
'Interest rates reflect the price of capital and the general perception that
inflation in Mexico is not yet fully under control,' he says.
