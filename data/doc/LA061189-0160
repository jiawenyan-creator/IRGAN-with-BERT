SMOKE FELLS 14 SAILORS IN SHIP FIRE 
Fourteen sailors suffered smoke inhalation when a Navy helicopter carrier 
caught fire in Long Beach Naval Station, but there was no serious damage to the 
ship. 
The Peleliu, an amphibious assault ship used as a helicopter carrier, caught 
fire on Friday night, Lt. Cmdr. Steve Chesser said. 
The fire apparently broke out in the circuit breaker room, where a cable from 
shore powers the ship while in port. The cause of the fire was not known, but 
an investigation was under way. 
Damage was minimal and the 14 sailors who suffered smoke inhalation were 
treated and returned to duty Saturday morning, Chesser said. 
The fire was put out by 10:30 p.m., less then twenty minutes after it was 
discovered, and repairs to the ship will be made by the crew. 
The Peleliu had recently returned from sea operations, but Chesser did not know 
the nature of the assignment. The ship normally has a crew of 900.
