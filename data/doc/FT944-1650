FT  19 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: News round-up - Milan
The market is bracing itself for further fireworks this week when Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the prime minister, faces a confidence vote, probably on
Wednesday, that could topple him from power. The market rose above the
political fray towards the end of last week, recouping the sharp losses of
Monday and enabling the index to close flat on the week.
Dealers also reported that foreign investors were returning as buyers,
apparently heeding the advice of a growing bank of strategists that the time
is right for the market to turn after falls in recent months.
