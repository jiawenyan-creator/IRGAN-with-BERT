Davies Hall to be Overhauled: The San Francisco Symphony has announced plans 
for a major $7 million to $9 million acoustic redesign of Louise M. Davies 
Symphony Hall in San Francisco, fueled by a $3-million challenge grant from 
Gordon Getty. 
The 3,000-seat hall has had a reputation for troublesome sound since it opened 
in 1980. The plan proposed by acoustician R. Lawrence Kirkegaard would create a 
new canopy of adjustable reflectors over the stage and reconfigure the hall to 
a more rectangular shape. Construction is planned for 1992. BETH KLEID
