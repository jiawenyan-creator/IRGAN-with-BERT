FT  04 SEP 92 / Salary warning for accountants
ACCOUNTANTS must expect salaries to continue to fall in the short-term and
little prospect of an upswing in employment over the next few years,
according to a survey by Challoner James, a financial recruitment agency.
London salaries for newly-qualified chartered accountants have fallen by
between 4 per cent and 5 per cent in the past six months into the Pounds
20,000-Pounds 25,000 range.
Salaries for chartered management accountants fell slightly, but held up
more strongly than any other qualification, reflecting the greater relevance
of the degree to many employers.
There was also strong demand for accountants with language skills and for
jobs in credit control, salaries supervision and internal auditing.
Mr Martin Humberstone, Challoner James operations director, dismissed as
'wishful thinking' projections that the falling graduate intake would lead
to renewed demand from employers in the mid 1990s.
He said employers were becoming far more selective and increasingly
recognised the need to hire people with sound business experience.
Recruitment firms were still spending considerable time 'rescuing'
newly-qualified chartered accountants hired by companies and struggling
because of a lack of experience.
ERNST &amp; YOUNG, the accountancy firm, has been forced to tighten its internal
controls after the discovery that one of its partners had 'misappropriated'
more than Pounds 300,000 last year.
Mr Andrew Oakley, a partner in the firm for more than 20 years, has been
dismissed and excluded from membership of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales. He was also ordered to pay Pounds 350
costs.
Ernst &amp; Young confronted Mr Oakley in early spring this year, fired him and
referred his case to the institute.
The firm was able to provide proof for the removal of Pounds 300,000 between
January 9 and October 30 last year, although the sums and the dates are
believed to have been more extensive.
