FT  16 SEP 93 / People: McNeil to head Bull Europe
The 'auld alliance' between Scotland and France was reinforced this week
with the announcement that George McNeil, currently heading Groupe Bull of
France's UK operations, is to be president and chief executive of Bull
Europe.
He is the latest British computer boss, tempered in the heat of the UK
recession, to be singled out for greater things in foreign-owned companies.
Geoff Unwin, for example, head of Hoskyns, now has executive responsibility
for France's CGS, the UK company's parent.
From October 1, McNeil's fiefdom will include all of Bull's European
affiliates with the understandable exception of France.
He will be the first UK manager to have reached such an exalted level in
Bull, a very French operation, and the first to become a member of Bull's
group executive committee. It is 'a nice, meaty international job', says
McNeil, who reports to Bernard Pache, Bull's chairman and chief executive.
Pache, a newcomer to the computer industry, will no doubt lean heavily on
McNeil's experience. Now 50, the Edinburgh-educated Scot joined Honeywell in
1965 and progressed through the company in a variety of positions including
vice president of manufacturing, large companies division, in Phoenix,
Arizona.
He believes that Bull UK's early moves to standard systems and a service
mentality, setting an example for the rest of the organisation, must have
played a part in his latest promotion. His toughest task, cultural
differences apart, will be to change mental attitudes in a company which has
for so long seen the manufacturing of large computers as its principal
activity.
