  [Text] Beijing, December 29 (XINHUA) -- The Industrial and 
Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) has undergone rapid growth in 
the past ten years of reform and opening up. 
  The total assets of the bank have swollen to 1,430 billion 
yuan (about 250 billion U.S. dollars) and its capital funds 
total 48 billion yuan (about 8.5 billion dollars), the ICBC 
announced. 
  This indicates an average annual increase of 47 percent of 
the volume of assets over the past decade. The bank said its 
yearly profit averaged 13.6 billion yuan (about 2.4 billion 
dollars). 
  Set up on January 1, 1984, ICBC was intended to take over 
the 
credit services of the People's Bank of China after the latter 
was ordered to function as China's central bank. 
  After ten years of development, ICBC has become the largest 
state-owned specialized bank in terms of assets, branches, 
services and advanced equipment. It ranked 13th among the 
world's 500 biggest banks listed by the British magazine 
"Banker." 
  ICBC also opened new channels to raise money, such as 
issuing 
financial bonds. The present remaining sum of the various loans 
totaled 1,070 billion yuan. 
  Meanwhile, ICBC brought in credit cards and joined the 
international Master Card and Visa Card organizations in 
succession. It has issued two million Mudan (Peony) Cards and is 
going to issue personal gold cards next year. 
  Officials from ICBC said that they were pondering next 
year's 
plan of reform and development, including laying down managerial 
regulations on the ratio of liabilities to assets and risk of 
assets, in line with the spirit of the Basle Accord."
