  [Text] Beijing, January 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese citizens' per 
capita shares of meat and eggs grew for the 14th year to 31 kg 
and 9.3 kg last year, an agriculture official said here today. 
  Jia Youling, an official in charge of the country's 
livestock 
husbandry, said in a national meeting on rural work that the 
figures reflect rapid increases over the 12.3 kg and 2.6 kg 
averages listed in 1980. 
  He said China produced an estimated 36.2 million tons of 
meat, about 1.2 million tons more than the production target set 
early last year by the government, adding that pork accounted 
for about 76 percent of the meat produced. 
  China also produced an estimated 10.91 million tons of eggs, 
up 7 percent over the previous year. 
  Milk output totaled six million tons last year. 
  Jia attributed the rapid increase to market-style animal 
husbandry policies initiated in the late 1970s, including 
leasing of grasslands, lifting of prices of livestock products 
and extension of new technologies. 
  However, fresh efforts are needed to produce more and better 
meat to meet growing demands, thanks to the economic boom. 
  He said about three quarters of the country's grasslands 
have 
not been contracted to herdsmen and about 1.75 million herdsmen 
are living a nomadic life, which makes it difficult to make 
better use of and protect grassland resources.
