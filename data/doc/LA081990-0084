INJURED PARACHUTIST ESCAPES CHARGES 
Authorities have decided a broken back is punishment enough and will not file 
charges against a man who parachuted from an unfinished high-rise. John Carta, 
44, a former Green Beret whose hobby is parachuting from skyscrapers and 
bridges, fractured his back in three places when his parachute failed Thursday.
