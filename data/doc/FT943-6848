FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Slough advances to Pounds 33.3m -
Development activities revived as industrial demand improves
Slough Estates, the UK's largest industrial property company, yesterday
announced a 16 per cent increase, from Pounds 28.8m to Pounds 33.3m, in
pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30, reflecting an improving
rental market.
Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman, was 'confident about the medium term prospects
for property in general and the company in particular'. He said Slough was
seeking more acquisitions, following the Pounds 76m invested in the first
half.
After a lull during the property slump of 1991-92, the company has revived
its property development activities, constructing 145,000 sq ft of property
in the last six months. It is proceeding with a further 230,000 sq ft of
development.
Mr Derek Wilson, group managing director, said Slough would proceed with
selective 'speculative developments', as demand for new industrial property
had substantially improved.
Turnover fell from Pounds 99m to Pounds 92.5m as a result of a sharp decline
in property trading activity.
Property investment revenue, however, increased from Pounds 66m to Pounds
72.1m.
In the UK, occupancy rose from 92.2 per cent to 93.4 per cent, as the
company achieved significant lettings. Occupancy levels for its
international portfolio also improved.
During the period, the company sold ADollars 46m (Pounds 21.9m) of
Australian property at above book value, but trading profits amounted to
only Pounds 800,000 and there were Pounds 500,000 of provisions against the
values of its trading portfolio. Property investment profits amounted to
Pounds 59.5m (Pounds 55.3m).
Slough acquired a Pounds 15.3m industrial estate, the Pounds 55m Winnersh
Triangle business estate, and Pounds 5.5m of industrial property in London
during the first six months of 1994, following five years of limited
activity.
The company is looking for other purchases, 'on a selective basis'.
There was a Pounds 4.4m associates' profit from disposals from the Candover
1989 Fund, compared with a nil contribution in 1993.
Basic earnings per share increased from 4.4p to 4.7p.
The interim dividend is held at 3.1p, as expected, as the 1993 full year
dividend was uncovered.
