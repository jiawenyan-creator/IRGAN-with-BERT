2. Northwest Pipeline Corp.


[Docket No. CP94282000]



Take notice that on March 11, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), 295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City,
Utah 84108, filed in Docket No. CP94282000 a request pursuant to 157.205 and 157.211 of
the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.211) for authorization to construct
and operate facilities in Klickitat County, Washington required to implement a firm transportation service for
Development Associates, Inc. (DA), under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82433000,
pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 

Northwest proposes to construct and operate approximately 5.3 miles of pipeline to partially loop and extend its
existing Hood River Lateral in Klickitat County, Washington and to construct and operate a new meter station, to be
named the KEP Meter Station. Northwest states that the proposed facilities would be used to provide approximately
11,000 million Btu per day of firm transportation service to the planned Klickitat Energy Partners (KEP), cogeneration
facility. Northwest states that the looping and other facility modification are required because the capacity of
the existing Hood River Lateral is fully committed to deliver up to 5,909 million Btu per day at two existing meter stations
for the account of Northwest Natural Gas Company under existing blanket agreements. It is indicated that KEP was formed
to develop, finance, construct and own the new KEP cogeneration facility. 

It is indicated that KEP's planned cogeneration plant would have 53.5 megawatts of generating capacity and would
consist of a natural gas-fired combustion turbine, a heat recovery steam generator and three steam turbines. It is
also stated that KEP has contracted to sell up to 49.5 average megawatts of power generated at its facility to the Bonneville
Power Administration under a 20-year contract and that process steam would be sold to a lumber company located at the
proposed plant site. 

Northwest states that DA has agreed with KEP to secure firm transportation service from Northwest to the plant site
beginning when the plant commences operations, scheduled for August 1995 and for plant start-up prior to that time.
It is indicated that Northwest and DA have modified existing transportation arrangements under Northwest's Rate
Schedule TF1 to provide the requested service.
