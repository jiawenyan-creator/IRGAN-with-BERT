POLITICAL CAMPAIGN COSTS AND FINANCING 
How much is an election worth? Apparently quite a bit, since Orange County 
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder has already raised $159,000 for her 1990 
reelection campaign. By the time the campaign is over, much more will probably 
be spent by the wealthy landowners, builders and developers who wish to see 
Wieder remain in office in order to preserve their political advantage. 
In a county that has real problems housing the homeless, feeding the hungry, 
coping with drug abuse, building affordable housing, providing health care, 
educating the young and caring for the elderly, expenditures of this magnitude 
on political campaigns seem nothing less than obscene. 
Spending in local, state and national campaigns has skyrocketed in the past 10 
years. In 1986 the average incumbent running for reelection in the House spent 
over $330,000 and in the Senate spent over $3 million. In 1984 the average seat 
in the California State Assembly cost $384,000. 
These expenditures are excessive in their own right. Indeed, along with 
Wieder's war chest, they are an embarrassment to our priorities as a society. 
More importantly, they make it all but impossible for the average citizen to 
run for office. Elections no longer tell us who is the best candidate. Rather, 
they reveal who has been the best fund raiser. That's a pitiful excuse for 
representative government. 
The time for national and state campaign financing and expenditure legislation 
is long overdue. Of course, it's not much of a surprise that well-entrenched 
incumbents have little incentive to regulate the very means they utilize to 
stay in power. As a result, it's time for the citizens of this state to 
reassert control over the costs and financing of political campaigns. We can do 
so by utilizing the initiative process and by sending a message to current 
officeholders that excess in the realm of campaign expenditures is not a 
virtue.
