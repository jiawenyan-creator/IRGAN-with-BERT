FT  03 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy
It is always difficult to make much sense of the UK reserves data. Still, a
small underlying fall for the second month in a row suggests that exchange
market intervention last September may have been smaller than originally
thought. Either that or the Bank has bought back some currency in the market
since then. Whatever the case, the upshot is that the contribution to this
quarter's PSBR funding from intervention must be scaled back. But since the
deficit may well be less than the Pounds 37bn forecast in the Autumn
Statement, the authorities still have a chance of starting 1993-94 with some
funding in the bag.
