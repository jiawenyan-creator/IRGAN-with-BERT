DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VENTURA, HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY WORK PLANNED 
The state Department of Transportation has announced that construction-related 
lane, ramp and connector road closures will continue this weekend on the 
Ventura and Hollywood freeways from Vineland to Haskell avenues. 
Caltrans advised motorists to avoid freeway travel in the vicinity of the 
Ventura and San Diego freeways throughout the weekend, and to instead use city 
streets such as Burbank and Ventura boulevards. 
The eastbound and westbound Vineland off-ramps to the Hollywood Freeway will be 
closed from 10 p.m. today to 5 a.m. Monday. 
From 11 tonight to 11 a.m. Saturday, the northbound San Diego Freeway connector 
to the westbound Ventura Freeway will be closed. From 11 p.m. Saturday to 11 
a.m. Sunday, three connector roads will be closed -- from the northbound San 
Diego Freeway to the westbound Ventura Freeway, from the westbound Ventura to 
the southbound San Diego, and from the eastbound Ventura to the northbound San 
Diego. 
On both nights, up to three westbound lanes on the Ventura Freeway will be 
closed between Van Nuys Boulevard and Haskell Avenue. 
The closings are part of a $61-million widening and resurfacing of the 
Hollywood and Ventura freeways from Universal City to Agoura Hills.
