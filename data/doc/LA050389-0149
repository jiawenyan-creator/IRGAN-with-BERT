P.M. BRIEFING; 
BELL HELICOPTER THREATENS LAYOFFS 
Bell Helicopter Textron will begin layoffs next week unless the Pentagon 
restores funding for the Osprey V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft, a company spokesman 
said today. 
In a letter to the Defense Department, Bell said it would halt work on the 
program Friday and begin laying off about 2,000 employees beginning Monday. 
Bell has been threatening to lay off employees since last week when it became 
clear the Osprey was in trouble. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Tuesday 
announced $10 billion in defense cuts, and among the items eliminated was the 
$1.8-million V-22 program. 
Funding for the V-22 remains intact through Sept. 30, but in a letter to the 
Naval Air Systems Command dated April 28, Bell said it would stop work on the 
program Friday and begin layoffs Monday unless the Defense Department comes up 
with more money.
