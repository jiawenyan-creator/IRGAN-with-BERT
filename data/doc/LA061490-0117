MORNING REPORT: DANCE 
Will Mukhamedov Dance in L.A.? Despite Tuesday's announcement of Irek 
Mukhamedov's defection from the Bolshoi Ballet to Britain's Royal Ballet, the 
acclaimed Soviet dancer could still appear on a portion of the Bolshoi's 
upcoming U.S. tour, including the Aug. 7-19 dates in Los Angeles. On Wednesday, 
a spokeswoman for the Royal Ballet said that Mukhamedov is committed to the 
Royal Ballet until Aug. 4, when the company takes off until Sept. 10. 
"What he does in that period is entirely up to him," she said. The Bolshoi's 
American tour representatives have said the dancer would be invited to 
participate in the tour when he's available, and that they intend to negotiate 
the question of that availability in the next few days. BETH KLEID
