FT  26 JAN 93 / Technology: How to manage ideas
Having a good idea is one thing. Making it work commercially is quite
another. Among big multinational companies, the awareness of the importance
of managing technology is well developed, but its practice still causes
plenty of headaches.
Nearly 90 per cent of executives at multinationals think their businesses
need some form of education in this area.
Their concerns centre on the strategic incorporation of technology in
business, the shortening of product development lifecycles and the speedier
adoption or abandonment of technologies.
The findings come from a survey by Decision Resources (a former affiliate of
Arthur D. Little, the US consultancy), Management Centre Europe and American
Management Association International. It was carried out among 120
executives of multinationals, based mostly in Europe and the US, at a
seminar in Boston.
The main obstacle to the proper management of technology is an emphasis on
short-term thinking, followed by internal competition over priorities, the
need to justify new technologies financially and lack of communication.
Most executives believe a clearer definition of short- and long-term goals
would help. Other solutions include placing higher priorities on the
development of technology, and improved communications. Almost all say their
company has taken steps to pay more heed to technology management.
Among these are: sponsoring staff education programmes; creating a senior
position for technology management; and decentralising research and
development. Innovation is not enough; commercial exploitation is just as
important. As John Kay, economics professor at the London Business School,
said last week: 'The real difficulty lies in turning innovation into
competitive advantage.'
