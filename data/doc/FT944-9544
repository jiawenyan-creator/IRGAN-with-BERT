FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: News Intl
News International is planning to amend its Articles of Association
following an issue of bonus preference shares by News Corporation, its
Australian parent.
Special dividend shares in News International are governed by a formula that
links the dividend paid to the dividend on ordinary shares in News Corp. The
shares are intended to reflect the rights and entitlements of ordinary
shareholders in News Corp.
The formula is now deemed inadequate because of the peculiar nature of the
bonus preference shares issued by News Corp on a 1-for-2 basis at the end of
September.
An amendment to the formula has been drawn up to protect the economic
interests of the special dividend holders in News International. It will be
put to them at a meeting early next year.
