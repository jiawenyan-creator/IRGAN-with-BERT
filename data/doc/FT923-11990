FT  22 JUL 92 / Peru rebels call 'armed strike'
PERU'S worst wave of terrorist bombings in 12 years is likely to ensure
widespread support for an 'armed strike' called for today by the Sendero
Luminoso guerrilla group, writes Sally Bowen in Lima. Messages painted on
shanty-town walls are warning inhabitants of Lima and key provincial cities
they risk death if they attempt to turn up for work.
In the past few days Sendero has intensified its campaign of terror in the
capital. On Monday night a car bomb wrecked Lima's Institute for Liberty and
Democracy, killing at least four passers-by and a security guard.
The institute, headed by Mr Hernando de Soto, a former presidential adviser,
had earlier published far-reaching proposals for reform of Peru's electoral
system in advance of elections called for November 22.
Last Thursday night a 600kg car-bomb devastated part of Miraflores, an
affluent suburb in Lima. Seventeen people died and more than 100 suffered
severe injuries. Hundreds of homes were evacuated, and 80 shops and a dozen
hotels were badly damaged.
The Miraflores attack was the first in which Sendero has targeted the
capital's civilian population, although police stations continue to be its
prime target.
Another seven bombings in different areas of Lima the same night highlighted
the guerrillas' capacity to act at will - even in a city under a state of
emergency and with a night-time vehicle curfew in force.
So far the military-backed government has made no response to demands by the
population for more effective anti-terrorist action.
