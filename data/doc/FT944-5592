FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: CIBC lifts payout as profits
surge
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce has underlined the strong improvement in
Canadian banks' performance by posting record earnings for fiscal 1994, and
lifting its dividend by 12 per cent.
Net earnings climbed to CDollars 890m (USDollars 647.1m), or CDollars 3.52 a
share, in the year to October 31 1994, from CDollars 730m, or CDollars 2.99,
a year earlier.
Return on equity rose to 11.7 per cent from 10.6 per cent. Return on assets
climbed to 0.60 per cent from 0.53 per cent.
The quarterly dividend has been raised by four cents to 37 cents a share.
The bank, Canada's second-biggest financial institution with assets of
CDollars 151bn, said it expected to benefit in the year ahead from stronger
economic growth and significantly lower loan losses.
Non-performing loans shrank to CDollars 1.5bn on October 31 from CDollars
2.4bn a year earlier. Loan losses for the year fell to CDollars 880m from
CDollars 920m.
CIBC is aggressively expanding operations in New York and London in an
attempt to become a leading force in international derivatives markets.
The bank said its revenues were boosted by strong growth in securities,
insurance, mutual funds management and credit businesses. However,
investments in the expanding derivatives operations, and in the fledgling
insurance and trust businesses, contributed to a 10 per cent jump in
non-interest costs.
National Bank of Canada posted a 36 per cent gain in fourth-quarter net
profit to CDollars 57m, or 29 cents a share, bringing return on equity to
10.6 per cent and on assets to 0.51 per cent, reports Robert Gibbens in
Montreal. Interest margins improved, home mortgages and business loans were
up and loan-loss provisions were lower. Higher fee income offset a lower
contribution from the brokerage unit.
Fiscal 1994 net profit was CDollars 217m, or CDollars 1.12, up 24 per cent
from CDollars 175m, or CDollars 1.01, in fiscal 1993. Return on equity was
10.5 per cent against 9.9 per cent, and on assets 0.50 per cent, up from
0.44 per cent.
National, Canada's sixth-largest bank, reported assets at October 31 were
almost CDollars 45bn, up 5 per cent from a year earlier.
