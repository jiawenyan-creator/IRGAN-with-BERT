FT  09 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Grubb optimistic on Tokyo
Mr Marcus Grubb at Salomon Brothers in London remained optimistic on the
outlook for Tokyo, believing that Mr Hosawawa's resignation might clarify
the political situation and accelerate the political fusion process.
He has raised his year-end forecast for the Nikkei index from 20,000 to
24,000, saying that the economy appeared to be bottoming out: he expected
gains in domestic sales, housing investment and consumption during the
fourth quarter and a switch back to equities by local investors as the
outlook improved.
