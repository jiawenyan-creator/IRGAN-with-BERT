FT  26 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Lasmo
Last week's 10 per cent fall in Lasmo shares raises fresh questions about
the outlook for the group. Granted, the shares are still comfortably above
their recent low. It is conceivable that a sustained rise in the oil price
following the mildly optimistic Opec meeting will partially relieve the
pressure on Lasmo's finances. Small disposals such as last Friday's sale of
half of Lasmo Canada will bring in much-needed cash. Arguably, it will take
something rather more dramatic to reassure investors worried that the
dividend is likely to be cut this year.
The obvious solution would be the quick sale of the US and Canadian
downstream assets acquired with Ultramar. But a lack of trade buyers who can
afford such properties has forced Lasmo to prepare the more expensive route
of a flotation. The ability of that mechanism to deliver value for
shareholders has been widely questioned. Perhaps Lasmo should consider a
late change of tack.
The thrust of its attack on Ultramar was the strategic weakness of
integrated downstream and upstream oil companies. Ironically, it is the
Ultramar downstream assets which have recovered fastest. The issue of its
credibility aside, Lasmo could reasonably argue that it makes commercial
sense to sell the assets at a later point in the cycle. If it could retain
existing management, so much the better. Shareholders might not like it. But
they would scarcely object if the alternative is a further loss of value.
