FT  24 JUN 94 / Stock Exchange probes up 60%
The number of investigations carried out by the London Stock Exchange into
possible breaches of trading and reporting rules rose more than 60 per cent
last year.
Its market supervision department carried out almost 500 investigations into
possible rule breaches compared with just over 295 in 1992-93.
According to the exchange's annual report, the number of cases relating to
unusual trading that were passed on to other agencies for further
investigation or prosecution also increased, from 62 to 75 in the year to
end-March 1994. It carried out more than 450 investigations into unusual
trading patterns or events.
Setting out planned management changes, Mr Michael Lawrence, chief
executive, said that he had begun seeking a new head of regulation. The
regulation activities include the role of Competent Authority for Listing
and supervision of the markets.
The report also revealed that the exchange had made a post-tax profit of
Pounds 4m after four successive years of deficit. Pre-tax profit of Pounds
18.9m compares with an Pounds 11.9m loss in 1992-93.
The Pounds 21.9m fall in operating costs, to Pounds 190.2m, is mainly the
result of no longer having to bear the costs of developing Taurus, the
discarded plans for a paperless settlement system, which totalled Pounds 38m
in 1992-93.
Costs for a replacement have risen by Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 11.6m.
The 1993-94 accounts include Pounds 20m provisions for the exchange's
leasehold properties because the fall in market rents means that it now
expects to incur 'a material loss'. This follows an initial Pounds 4m
provision in 1993.
