DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN ARRESTED OVER HARASSING NEIGHBORS 
A 25-year-old Montrose man was arrested on suspicion of making numerous 
annoying phone calls to members of a La Canada Flintridge family and painting 
swastikas on their garage and automobile, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies 
said. 
Randy John Emerson, a former neighbor of the victims, was arrested Tuesday 
evening on suspicion of vandalism and of making more than 20 telephone calls to 
the residence of David Baisley, 53, since the beginning of the year. 
Baisley reported the calls to deputies after he received four in one hour May 
23. According to deputies, Baisley said the calls had "neo-Nazi overtones." 
Baisley told authorities Monday morning that he had found swastikas painted on 
his garage door and car hood. 
Deputy Gabe Ramirez said call-tracing equipment was placed on phones in the 
house in the 200 block of Baptiste Way, and a call was traced Tuesday to the 
home of Emerson's parents, who are neighbors of the Baisleys. 
Further investigation determined that Emerson made the calls while at his 
parents' house and he was arrested, Ramirez said. The motivation was unknown, 
deputies said. 
Emerson was being held in lieu of $10,000 bail.
