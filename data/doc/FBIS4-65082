  [Text] Geneva, May 11 (AFP) -- The UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees is short of 236 million dollars to help until 
year's end four million refugees from the former Yugoslavia, the 
agency said Wednesday [11 May]. 
  The UNHCR said it needed a total 338 million dollars for the 
entire year -- or 918,000 dollars a day -- but had received only 
102 million dollars from donor countries by March 31, leaving a 
236-million-dollar hole. 
  The main beneficiary of United Nations aid is 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, followed by Croatia.
