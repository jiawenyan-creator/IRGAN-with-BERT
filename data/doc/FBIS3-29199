operating in Central Luzon was killed during a gunbattle with 
policemen that lasted for about 15 minutes. A newly-recruited

  11 February 
  Twenty communist rebels from Cotabato surrendered to 
military authorities out of frustration over the turbulent 
quarrels plaguing the communist movement. The leader of those 
who surrendered assured the military that he will lead a 
campaign to win back fellow rebels, persuade them to accept the 
government's peace offer, and avail themselves of the amnesty 
program of the government. The rebels turned in 11 firearms, 
mostly homemade. (Manila MANILA BULLETIN pp 1, 8) 
  Twelve regular members and supporters of the NPA in Pampanga 
surrendered to the provincial command of the Philippine National 
Police. The surrender was the result of successful operations 
launched by the command last month. (Manila MANILA BULLETIN p
