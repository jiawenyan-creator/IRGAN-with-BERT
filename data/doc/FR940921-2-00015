In the Matter of: The Trane Company (Case No. F074) 


Background 


The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 10012, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA
1988), Public Law 100357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102486, 106 Stat. 2776,
which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer
products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption
that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, subpart
B. 
The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 to create a waiver process. 45 FR 64108,
September 26, 1980. Thereafter, DOE further amended its appliance test procedure waiver process to allow the Assistant
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver from test
procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986. 
The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily test procedures for a particular basic model
when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according
to the prescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so
unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers
generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is
the subject of the waiver. 
The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Assistant Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver
when it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver
is denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines
that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary.
