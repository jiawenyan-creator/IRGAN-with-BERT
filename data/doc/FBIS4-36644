  [Text] In an interview with the BBC, Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim 
al-Iryani, minister of planning and development, has asserted 
that our country is strictly adhering to the cease-fire. 
  He said: We continued to watch the situation from 1800 
yesterday until midnight, and all positions in Aden Governorate 
were sending successive cables saying that the rebels had not 
stop their artillery shelling. 
  He said: Our country has informed the United Nations of 
this, and reaffirmed that we are continuing to adhere to the 
cease-fire in spite of the continuous shelling of the Armed 
Forces' positions by the rebels. 
  Dr. al-Iryani expressed the belief that the rebels and those 
who support them have no interest in the cease-fire because 
their objective is to summon foreign forces onto Yemeni land. 
He said: They do not have any consideration for Yemeni 
sovereignty. He added: The objective of the rebels is 
unreasonable and illogical, and shows no respect for the 
homeland's sovereignty. As for our position, the cease-fire is 
our only concern. 
  Answering a question on reports that the Gulf states intend 
to recognize the rebels, al-Iryani replied by saying: This will 
be considered a continuation of aggression against the 
sovereignty, unity, and safety of Yemen, and an attempt to 
perpetuate the shedding of Yemeni blood.
