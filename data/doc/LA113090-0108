PEOPLE: A &amp; M RECORDS NAMES AL CAFARO PRESIDENT 
Longtime record executive Al Cafaro has been named president of A&amp;M 
Records, the Los Angeles-based label of the Dutch music concern Polygram N.V. 
The 42-year-old Cafaro, who joined A&amp;M Records in 1977 as a promotion 
manager, fills a post that had been held by A&amp;M Chairman and Chief 
Executive Jerry Moss. Moss has served as president since A&amp;M President Gil 
Friesen resigned in April shortly after A&amp;M was sold to Polygram. 
A&amp;M in recent months has suffered a round of layoffs as well as the loss of 
a multimillion-dollar distribution pact with Windham Hill Records. But Cafaro, 
a former radio station deejay, said he expects the label to turn around as it 
gears up early next year for a host of new releases from veteran artists such 
as Sting, Amy Grant and Barry White.
