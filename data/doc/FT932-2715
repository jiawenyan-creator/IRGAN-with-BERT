FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Teesside
Teesside Holdings, the unquoted owner of the port of Tees &amp; Hartlepool,
announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.3m on turnover of Pounds 43.8m for
the 12 months to March 31 - the first full year since the port's
privatisation early in 1992.
The company said the profit figure could not be compared with similar
pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.3m for the previous year because of changes in
the company's financial structure arising from the sale of the port to the
Teesside Holdings consortium. Turnover, however, rose 10 per cent.
Tees &amp; Hartlepool was the first and most controversial of five trust ports
privatisations that took place last year. Its sale for Pounds 180m to
Teesside Holdings aroused bitter resentment from rival bidders.
Last November the port lost a valuable contract to import and export cars
for Nissan, the Japanese car manufacturer with a plant in Sunderland.
Mr Bill Andrews, chairman, said the loss of the contract had come as 'a
great disappointment', but the company was using its ample resources to
invest in new dockside facilities to replace and increase business for the
future.
