OUTTAKES: BATTRAILERS 
Batfans take note: The first trailer of the still-filming $35-million-plus 
"Batman" -- with Michael Keaton as the Caped Crusader -- is now showing. 
A Warner Bros. PR exec said that 350-500 trailers have been sent to "premiere 
houses" and "everyone seems to love them." 
But reactions from the Bat-critics we polled were mixed. 
One Batcritic said that as Bruce Wayne, Keaton looks like, well, Keaton -- "a 
nebbish." But the shots of him in his Batcostume were heralded as "awesome!" 
But is it Keaton or the costume that's awesome? The way it's made, even a 
97-pound weakling would look Schwarzeneggian. 
What's more (or less), you can't even tell it's Keaton in the costume -- until 
a shot in which Our Hero, while effortlessly lifting a bad guy, squeakily 
proclaims, "I'm Batman." 
A Warners rep stressed that the trailer was made up of raw daily footage, and 
that Keaton will later re-do his lines. 
One thing that may not need reworking is the Batmobile: One Batfan proclaimed: 
"It's absolutely incredible! Every kid will have to have one next Christmas."
