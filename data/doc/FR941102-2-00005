SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The Department may revoke an antidumping finding if the Secretary concludes that the finding is no longer of any interest
to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping finding when no interested
party has requested an administrative review for five consecutive review periods and when no domestic interested
party objects to revocation (19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii)). 
On August 1, 1994, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 38956) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping findings on titanium sponge from Estonia, Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan (August 28, 1968).

Additionally, as required by 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent to revoke
these antidumping findings on each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested parties who
might object to the revocation were provided the opportunity to submit their comments not later than the last day of
the anniversary month. 
In this case, we received no requests for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested
party, as defined under 353.2 (k)(3), (k)(4), (k)(5), or (k)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed
opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping findings on titanium sponge
from Estonia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,
and Uzbekistan are no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are revoking these antidumping
findings in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii). 


Scope of the Findings 


Imports covered by these revocations are shipments of titanium sponge from Estonia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus,
Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. This merchandise is currently
classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item number 8108.10.5010. The HTS number is provided for convenience

These revocations apply to all unliquidated entries of titanium sponge from Estonia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus,
Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, entered, or withdrawn from

1994, will be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(e). The Department will instruct the
Customs Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn
from warehouse, for consumption on or after August 1, 1994, without regard to antidumping duties, and to refund any
estimated antidumping duties collected with respect to those entries. This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(d).
