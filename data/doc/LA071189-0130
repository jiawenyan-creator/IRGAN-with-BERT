OUSTED LEADER ZHAO MAY BE TRIED, CHINESE SUGGEST 
China today refused to rule out a trial and further punishment for Zhao Ziyang, 
who was ousted as Communist Party chief for opposing the military crackdown 
that crushed pro-democracy demonstrators. 
"His problem is still being investigated," government spokesman Yuan Mu said at 
the first news conference by a high-ranking official since troops on June 3-4 
marched on Tian An Men Square and attacked unarmed demonstrators. 
When the party Central Committee ousted him as secretary general on June 24, it 
accused Zhao of supporting the protesters and splitting the party, and said his 
case would be dealt with internally. Since then, however, official criticism 
has escalated, fueling speculation Zhao may stand trial. 
Collaboration Alleged 
One major government report last week accused Zhao's aides of collaborating 
with protest leaders accused of trying to overthrow the government. It stopped 
short of also accusing Zhao of plotting a coup. 
Yuan stressed that the party charges and decision to treat Zhao's case as an 
internal disciplinary matter are not final. 
"How the problem will finally be dealt with will be decided according to the 
findings of the investigation," he told more than 100 Chinese and foreign 
reporters. 
Also today, authorities deported two reporters -- one American and one 
Taiwanese -- and gave a second Taiwanese reporter 48 hours to leave. All are 
accused of violating martial law bans on reporting activity. They bring to nine 
the number of reporters ordered to leave China since June 4. 
The deported American is Mark Hopkins, a reporter for the U.S. government-run 
Voice of America.
