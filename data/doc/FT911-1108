FT  08 MAY 91 / Software 'theft' ruling overturned
A US COURT of Appeals yesterday reversed a 1987 bankruptcy court decision
that the Justice Department stole special software developed by Inslaw, a
Washington-based computer software company.
The decision is a blow to Inslaw, which claims its case-tracking software,
known as Promis, found its way to the intelligence services of Canada,
Israel and Iraq after its alleged theft by the department. The decision also
reverses a 1988 federal district court ruling that upheld the bankruptcy
court's view that the department stole the software by 'trickery, fraud and
deceit'.
Yesterday's ruling was based on the view that the federal bankruptcy court
had no authority, on jurisdictional grounds, to hand down its 1987 decision
against the department.
Mr Elliot Richardson, Inslaw's defence lawyer and a former US
Attorney-General, said: 'This is a narrow jurisdictional ruling. The lower
courts' findings that the Department of Justice stole Inslaw's software were
not addressed.' Inslaw has 45 days to decide whether to petition the appeals
court to reconsider, or the company could file a suit based on the Trade
Secrets Act or ask the Supreme Court to hear the case.
