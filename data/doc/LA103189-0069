Brea Acquisition: Programmed Composites Inc., a Brea manufacturer of composite 
materials, has been acquired by a Pennsylvania company for an undisclosed 
price. 
Ketema Inc., a Bensalem, Pa., industrial manufacturer, acquired the 50-employee 
Brea firm "because it fits with our effort to get into the aerospace composite 
industry" said William H. Spencer, a Ketema spokesman. 
Spencer said the composite industry is one of the fastest-growing areas of the 
aerospace market. Composites are reinforced plastics that are gaining increased 
use by aircraft manufacturers to produce more durable, lighter-weight 
components. 
Programmed Composites makes composite materials used primarily in 
communications satellites.
