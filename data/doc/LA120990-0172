ZULU LEADER ACCUSES ANC OF POWER GRAB 
Zulu leader Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi said Nelson Mandela's African National 
Congress is seeking monopolistic power as the white National Party is giving it 
up. "We do not want any future head of state of South Africa to have the kind 
of power that (Iraq's) Saddam Hussein has over everything that lives and 
breathes in his land," Buthelezi told the inaugural conference of his Inkatha 
Freedom Party. Inkatha supporters and pro-ANC Zulus are in a power struggle 
that has claimed about 4,000 lives.
