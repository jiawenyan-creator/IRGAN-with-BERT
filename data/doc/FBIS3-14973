<F P=106> [Gennadiy Miranovich report: "Council of CIS Defense </F>
Ministers Acquires New Quality"] 
  [Text] The Council of CIS Defense Ministers has acquired a 
new quality. And Colonel General Viktor Samsonov, chief of the 
Staff for Coordinating Military Cooperation, commented that this 
does not only stem from the Statute on the Council of 
Commonwealth Defense Ministers that has been adopted. 
  As you know, in connection with a number of new states 
subscribing to the Treaty on Collective Security this body, 
which previously also performed political functions, is now the 
Collective Security Council's main consultative body on military 
questions. Commenting on the results of the latest session of 
the Council of Defense Ministers 24-25 February, Col. Gen. 
Samsonov also pointed to the growing interest among the 
independent states' military departments in strengthening 
defense cooperation.
