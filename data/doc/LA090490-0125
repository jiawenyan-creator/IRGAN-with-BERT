HLYWD. FWY. LANE CLOSURES SET 
Caltrans will shut down various lanes of the Hollywood Freeway between Chandler 
Boulevard and Victory Boulevard in North Hollywood beginning tonight as the 
agency undertakes a three-month road rebuilding project. 
The highway agency plans to conduct the work between 8 p.m. tonight and 5 a.m. 
Wednesday and continue on weekdays. After mid-September, the project will also 
involve work on the weekends. 
Also tonight, Caltrans will begin reconstructing the median guardrail on a 
stretch of the Ventura Freeway between the Hollywood Freeway and Pass Avenue in 
Toluca Lake.
