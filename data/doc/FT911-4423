FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Havelock Europa ahead but warns on outlook
HAVELOCK EUROPA, the shopfitting group where institutional shareholders
insisted on the installation of a new chairman and chief executive in 1989,
substantially increased pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.5m in 1990.
But Sir Lewis Robertson, chairman, warned of a falling order book in a 'cold
and unhelpful climate' for shopfitting. That would have an adverse effect on
profits in the first half of 1991 although there should be an improvement in
the second six months.
Sir Lewis said he now regarded Havelock as having been restored to health
under Mr Hew Balfour, chief executive. Pre-tax profit compared with Pounds
312,000 for the 36 weeks to December 31 1989, and Pounds 52,000 in the prior
full year.
He said that Havelock's customers, which include retail groups such as Boots
and Marks and Spencer as well as TSB in the financial services sector, had
proved more resilient than the average. The group benefited from a reduction
in borrowings from Pounds 3.55m to Pounds 1.15m over the year.
Although the order book finished 1990 at a strong level it had not been
fully maintained since then, and there was some pressure on margins.
The Havelock Technical Services subsidiary was closed during the year which
meant an extraordinary provision of Pounds 352,000.
Mr Balfour said Havelock aimed to become the market leader in large
department store fitting. It wanted to reduce its seasonal profit variations
by expanding further into fitting financial services premises and expected
shortly to announce co-operation with NCR, which makes self-service banking
equipment.
Group sales in 1990 were Pounds 46.8m (Pounds 32.79m). Earnings per share
came to 5.8p (1.6p) and the final dividend is 2.1p for a total of 3.6p
(2.5p).
