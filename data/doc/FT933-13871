FT  16 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Poor market outlook pushes
cocoa prices up Pounds 16
LONDON'S COCOA futures market maintained its buoyant mood yesterday with
nearby positions reaching 19-month highs. The September contract, which rose
by Pounds 11 on Wednesday, touched Pounds 789 a tonne before closing at
Pounds 775 a tonne, up Pounds 16 on the day.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at London broker GNI, attributed the recent
change of sentiment to a growing realisation that the structural imbalance
that had developed in the world cocoa market would continue to worsen until
prices moved out of the depressed range in which they had been confined for
much of this year.
While consumption had gone on rising by 2-3 per cent a year, overall world
production had stagnated, he explained. That had resulted in the
supply/demand deficits of the past two years and the 'near certainty' of
another in 1993-94.
Early indications were that this year's Ivory Coast and Ghana crops would be
'average at best', he said, while the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer,
had, to the surprise of many international cocoa dealers, stood by its
decision to ban exports of mid-crop beans.
