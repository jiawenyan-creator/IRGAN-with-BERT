FREEWAY SERIES OPENER TO BE TELEVISED 
Channel 5 plans to televise the Angels' Freeway Series opener with the Dodgers 
on April 6, KTLA officials announced Wednesday. 
Before the 32-day lockout, KTLA had planned to broadcast two Angel spring 
training games, March 24 against San Francisco and March 25 against Seattle. 
The station will now televise only the April 6 Angel-Dodger game. 
KTLA's first regular-season telecast will be on April 17, when the Angels play 
the Oakland Athletics at Anaheim Stadium. 
KMPC (710), the Angels' radio flagship station, will air all 14 exhibition 
games, starting with Monday's game against San Diego in Yuma, Ariz. ELLIOTT
