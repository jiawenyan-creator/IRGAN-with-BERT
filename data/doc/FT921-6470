FT  27 FEB 92 / Impressionists perk up at modest prices: Saleroom
THE MARKET for Impressionist and Modern art priced below Dollars 500,000
seems to have turned the corner. Both Sotheby's and Christie's held
successful auctions in New York on Tuesday, with Sotheby's bringing in
Dollars 3.1m (Pounds 1.77m) with just 12 per cent unsold and Christie's
Dollars 2.6m with 10 per cent unsold.
The auction houses had persuaded sellers to put realistically modest
reserves on the works and bidding, particularly from private buyers, was
brisk.
The top price was Dollars 286,000 (slightly below estimate) which secured
Chagall's 'Bouquet de Bleuets' at Sotheby's. In the same rooms 'Vue de
Montmartre' by Soutine sold for Dollars 275,000 while a Montmartre scene by
Utrillo realised Dollars 187,000.
At Christie's a bronze head of a bull by Picasso, cast in 1950 as one of an
edition of two, doubled its estimate at Dollars 231,000 and 'Cavallini',
ghost-like horses by Zoran Music, made Dollars 115,000.
The firmer market was also shown in London, where Christie's held its most
successful auction of watercolours and pictures of birds since this sale
category was started in 1989. 'Clearing After Rain: Red Grouse among the
Heather' by Archibald Thorburn sold for Pounds 44,000 to a private buyer.
All the seven top lots were by Thorburn, with three going to Italian
collectors. The auction totalled Pounds 507,551 with 21 per cent unsold.
An auction record price for a block of stamps from the Transvaal was paid at
Christie's when a group of 6d ultramarine, printed in 1870, sold for Pounds
13,200. One stamp had been inadvertently printed upside-down. Only five such
examples are known and the other four are in museum collections, including
that of the Queen.
