BRIEFLY 
BAT to Shut U.S. Office: Batus, London-based BAT Industries' U.S. holding 
company, based in Louisville, Ky., will be phased out this year, the company 
said. BAT's Brown &amp; Williamson tobacco unit in Louisville and Farmers Group 
insurance subsidiary in Los Angeles will then operate as independent entities 
reporting directly to London. The move is part of BAT's sale of its paper and 
retailing businesses to focus on tobacco and financial services.
