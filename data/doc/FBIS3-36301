  [Text] Experts of the IMF, who recently visited Belarus, 
have encouraged the Belarusian leadership's efforts to develop 
close economic ties with Russia. They underlined the advantages 
of economic integration with Russia. At the same time, these 
advantages, according to expert opinions, do not imply the
