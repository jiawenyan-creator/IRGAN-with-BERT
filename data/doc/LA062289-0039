MY BEST RECIPE . . . BUTTER CAKE FROM MOM 
"This is a recipe from my mother who lives in Tennessee," Cindy Bowers writes. 
"This cake was made by her mother and others before her, I'm sure. 
"We have this cake at all of our family gatherings served with fresh 
strawberries or peaches. It is our strawberry shortcake. The cake is very easy 
to put together and the ingredients are always at hand." 
BUTTER CAKE 
1 cup butter or margarine, softened 
2 cups sugar 
6 eggs 
2 cups flour 
1 teaspoon vanilla 
Sliced peaches or whole berries 
Whipped cream 
Cream butter until light. Gradually add sugar. Mix well. Add eggs and flour 
alternately to butter mixture. (Batter will be thick.) Stir in vanilla. Turn 
into greased and floured 10-inch bundt pan. Bake at 350 degrees 1 hour or until 
wood pick comes out clean. Serve with fresh fruit and whipped cream. Makes 1 
cake.
