II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



NSCC is seeking permanent approval of a proposed rule change that modifies the amount of a member's required clearing
fund deposit that may be collateralized by letters of credit. Specifically, the proposed rule change increases the
minimum cash contribution for those members who use letters of credit from $50,000 to the greater of $50,000 or 10%
of their required clearing fund deposit up to a maximum of $1,000,000. In addition, the rule change provides that only
70% of a member's required clearing fund deposit may be collateralized with letters of credit. The rule change also
adds headings to the clearing fund formula section for purposes of clarity and includes other nonsubstantive drafting
changes. The effect of the proposed rule change is to increase the liquidity of the clearing fund and to limit NSCC's
exposure to unusual risks resulting from the reliance on letters of credit.

Since obtaining temporary approval of the original filing, NSCC has filed clearing fund composition reports with
the Commission. NSCC states that since December 31, 1989, as a result of the new requirements, it has observed the following
changes in the composition of the clearing fund:

1. Cash deposits have increased by approximately 225%;

2. The value of securities deposited has increased by approximately 205%;

</FOOTNAME>
In October of 1989 when the Commission initially granted temporary approval of NSCC's proposal, letters of credit
accounted for 76% of the total dollar value of required clearing fund deposits. By May 28, 1993, letters of credit accounted
for less than 30%. During the period from June 1, 1992 to May 28, 1993, letters of credit accounted for an average of 30.49%
of the total dollar value of required clearing fund deposits, and for no month during that period did the portion of
letters of credit used for required clearing fund deposits rise above 34%. Letter from Karen L. Saperstein, Vice President/Director
of Legal  Associate General Counsel, NSCC, to Jerry W. Carpenter, Branch Chief, Division, Commission (June
10, 1993).

</FOOTNOTE>


NSCC states that the proposal is consistent with its requirements under Section 17A of the Act because it enhances
NSCC's ability to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or under its control.
