FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: IBM acts to boost sales
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines said it would make new mainframe computer
models available several months ahead of its planned schedule in a move to
boost sales.
The new mid and low-range models, which were announced last year, extend
IBM's latest ES/9000 range of computers.
IBM executives said delivery dates had been advanced because improvements in
manufacturing processes enabled the company to move more quickly.
Demand for IBM's most powerful mainframe computers has not declined, despite
economic trends, company executives said.
Competitors say, however, that IBM has been offering steep discounts to
customers in order to boost sales.
Four new mid-range models are available now, IBM said, and a fifth would be
available at the end of June. Upgrades for older IBM models will also be
available sooner than expected. IBM also announced two new low-end
mainframes.
