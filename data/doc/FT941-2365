FT  21 MAR 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news
Tuesday: The French trade surplus is expected to fall to FFr7.5bn in January
from the very large FFr13.2bn in December. Italian inflation is under
control and consumer prices should show only a small increase in March.
Wednesday: The German M3 money supply figure is expected from the Bundesbank
any time from Wednesday on. It is forecast to show an annualised rise of
15.0 per cent in the money supply in February, after January's 21.2 per cent
increase. The peculiar method of calculation, comparing each month with
1993's fourth quarter average, will continue to produce high rates of growth
for some time. Germany's March cost-of-living indices may show subdued
inflation.
Thursday: Final estimates of UK gross domestic product in the final quarter
of 1993 are unlikely to show a change from the previous estimate of 2.6 per
cent annual growth in Q4, but will provide a breakdown of the balance of
payments for 1993.
Friday: The UK Confederation of British Industry's monthly survey of
manufacturing trends will provide clues as to how optimistic industry is
about the recovery.
