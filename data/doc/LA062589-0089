MISSING THE POINT 
I am an 11th-grade student attending the University of San Diego High School 
and I have recently finished reading "Death of a Salesman" in my honors 
American literature class. Rev. Billy Falling's proposed prevention of aloud 
reading of certain literature such as this is disturbing. 
This gentleman is apparently overlooking the entire significance of works by 
Arthur Miller and others. It is offensive that he is proposing a ban on a play 
he has read only one fifth of. He is missing the whole meaning, the whole 
greatness of this work. Perhaps if he were to sit down and read the play from 
cover to cover, instead of skimming 13 pages in search of profanities, his 
theoretical arguments might have some ground. 
He is overlooking the themes portrayed in this play represented by Willy, an 
old man fighting to be remembered, to be a success. He is representative of all 
those pursuing wrong goals of wealth, success and material value. Through his 
death, the reader learns of the tragedy of designing one's life around personal 
gain. Rev. Falling might be surprised to find that students can learn a lesson 
from literature of this nature. Speaking from my class experience with this 
play, I know that our class as a whole learned more about theme and American 
culture than we did about new profanities. I doubt that any student finished 
that play and only remembered a few "hells and damns." 
There is so much more involved here, and Falling is obviously ignoring all of 
it in his radical proposal. What do his objections pose to the students? They 
place an emphasis on the vocabulary of a work, and devalue its cultural 
standing.
