FT  12 JUN 93 / Change on audit fee disclosure
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is proposing to amend the legislation
governing disclosure of fees generated by auditors in companies' annual
accounts.
Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs, said he wanted to remove
the requirement for disclosure of associates of auditors where the auditors'
only relationship to the associates is as insolvency practitioner.
But this includes many companies which are classified as associates only
because an insolvency partner in a firm of auditors has been appointed to it
and has control of at least 20 per cent of the voting rights.
The existing regulations came into force in October 1991 following
consultation designed to deal with potential conflicts of interest.
Comments on the DTI consultative paper are invited by July 30.
