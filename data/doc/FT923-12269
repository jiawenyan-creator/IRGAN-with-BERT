FT  20 JUL 92 / New car sales in west Europe fall by 5.3%
NEW car sales in west Europe fell by 5.3 per cent in June to 1.13m from
1.19m a year ago, according to industry estimates.
Demand weakened in Germany and in many of the small and medium-sized
European markets. New car sales in June were lower than a year ago in 11 of
17 markets across west Europe.
The decline in June accelerated the downward trend that began in March.
Sales have been lower than a year ago in three of the last four months.
New car sales in the first six months of the year fell by 1 per cent to
7.34m from 7.42m in the same period a year ago, according to industry
estimates. Sales were lower than a year ago in 8 of 17 west European markets
including Germany and the UK.
The significant fall in sales in June was caused most importantly by an
estimated 17.4 per cent drop in demand in Germany to 356,000.
New car sales in Germany are retreating from the record levels achieved a
year ago in the wake of unification.
The sharp fall in sales in Germany, the biggest single European new car
market, was exacerbated by the declining demand in most small and
medium-sized European markets in June, led by a sharp 22.5 per cent drop in
sales in Finland.
These declines could not be compensated by the continuing strength of demand
last month in Italy and Spain, where new car sales were 9.6 and 13.4 per
cent higher respectively than a year ago, nor by a rebound in sales in
France where new car registrations rose by 7.7 per cent year-on-year.
The fragile recovery in new car demand in the UK continued last month with a
rise of 4.4 per cent, but in the first six months sales were still 4.1 per
cent lower than the very depressed level of a year ago.
Japanese car sales in west Europe fell by 5.7 per cent in the first half of
the year.
Japanese car makers have been hit by the changing pattern of new car sales
across Europe and the relatively higher decline in demand in the unprotected
European markets where they have their main strength, most importantly in
Germany. Demand has grown most strongly this year in the protected markets
of Italy and Spain, where Japanese car makers have only a small share.
The Volkswagen group of Germany, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda, has
established a record lead in the first six months.
It boosted its share of west European new car sales to 17.7 per cent from
16.8 per cent a year ago, thanks most importantly to the success of its Audi
and SEAT marques. Sales of its up-market Audi brand rose by an estimated
12.7 per cent in the first six months narrowly outselling both BMW and
Mercedes-Benz, while sales by SEAT, the VW group's Spanish subsidiary, were
14.6 per cent higher than a year ago.
Skoda, the Czechoslovak car maker where VW has management control, fared
less favourably with sales in west Europe falling by 6.3 per cent. Sales of
the VW brand rose by an estimated 1.9 per cent helped by growing output of
the new generation VW Golf, Europe's best selling car.
Among the big six volume car makers in Europe Fiat of Italy and Ford of the
US have lost most ground with declines of 6.2 and 6.1 per cent respectively.
BMW, the German executive and luxury car maker, has made some of the biggest
gains.
The company increased its sales by 13.3 per cent in the first six months and
for the first time in its history has outsold Mercedes-Benz in west Europe
in the first six months.
The main loser among European car makers is Rover, the subsidiary of British
Aerospace, whose sales in west Europe plunged by 16.4 per cent in the first
half of the year to 156,000, depressing its market share to only 2.1 per
cent.
