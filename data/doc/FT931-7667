FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sun Alliance unit in Hafnia bid
CODAN, the Danish insurance group controlled by the UK's Sun Alliance, has
made a bid for Hafnia Insurance and Hafnia Bank. However, it is not
interested in acquiring the Hafnia group's strategic shareholdings in its
Danish competitor, Baltica, and Sweden's Skandia.
A second Danish insurance group, Alm. Brand, also said that it had made a
bid for Hafnia's insurance and banking operations.
Hafnia suspended payments to its creditors last August after sustaining
heavy investment losses on its its holdings in Baltica and Skandia.
Hafnia holds 33.6 per cent of the shares in Baltica and 13.8 per cent in
Skandia.
Potential bidders had until last Friday to submit bids for Hafnia. Mr Klaus
Moe of Hafnia yesterday confirmed that 'we have received a number of
offers', including that made by Codan and Am Brand. Hafnia would not specify
who the other bidders were. Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, Skandia of
Sweden, Tryg Forsikring of Denmark and Germany's Allianz, have been linked
with Hafnia in the past.
In a possible complication, Codan said it had submitted its bid to Den
Danske Bank, Denmark's biggest bank and Hafnia's biggest creditor, rather
than to Morgan Stanley, the US securities house which is handling the sale
of Hafnia assets.
Codan said its bid would not be submitted to Hafnia Holding 'for as long as
that company continues to negotiate the sale of Hafnia Holding 1992 (the
company which holds both insurance and banking subsidiaries)'.
Codan also said it was making its bid conditional on Hafnia negotiating with
a 'single party . . . after examining the bids received', a procedure
originally proposed by Hafnia in November 1992.
Sun Alliance would not comment on reports that it might be prepared to
reduce its stake from 71.5 per cent to 51 per cent if Codan opted to fund
its bid for Hafnia through a share offer.
