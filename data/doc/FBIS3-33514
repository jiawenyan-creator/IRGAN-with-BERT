<F P=106> [Interview with Brazilian President Itamar Franco by Marcia </F>
Carmo; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Carmo] Would you support Minister Fernando 
Henrique's candidacy for the presidency? 
  [Franco] The government does not have a candidate. If he 
were chosen as a candidate he would be an excellent choice and 
would enjoy the government's support. This is wishful thinking 
because in December he and other ministers sent me a letter 
saying he would not run for elections. I prefer to leave things 
as they stand. 
  [Carmo] But is he a candidate? 
  [Franco] Only he can answer that question. 
  [Carmo] Do you think he will leave his post with a 
40-percent 
inflation rate? 
  [Franco] Only he can also answer that question. 
  [Carmo] Would Fernando Henrique's exit from the government 
mean the end of the economic plan? 
  [Franco] The economic plan does not belong to Fernando, it 
belongs to the government. 
  [Carmo] Why do you think he would be a good candidate? 
  [Franco] He would be an excellent candidate -- one must 
stress -- if he were a candidate. He is intelligent, astute, a 
good politician, a patriot who took on a collapsed economy and a 
bankrupt state. 
  [Carmo] Is Antonio Britto Fernando Henrique's ticket mate? 
  [Franco] An excellent ticket. Britto is an excellent 
candidate. The government still does not have any preference. 
  [Carmo] Are you in favor of extending the resignation 
deadline for those who hold public posts and want to run for 
election? 
  [Franco] I do not have an opinion on this matter. 
  [Carmo] Will we see better days after Carnival? 
  [Franco] We hope so; we hope Congress will immediately 
approve the economic plan and the budget. 
  [Carmo] Pedro Simon, the government leader in the Senate, 
blamed your advisers for letting model Lilian Ramos onto your 
balcony. 
  [Franco] Does Pedro Simon understand what Carnival is all 
about? 
  [Carmo] Have you read the newspapers yet? 
  [Franco] No. But I have received many photographs. 
  [Carmo] Do you feel you have debased the dignity of your 
post 
by being photographed with a woman wearing nothing but a T-shirt? 
  [Franco] It is my duty, as president of the Republic, to 
greet and talk to everyone. 
  [Carmo] You are being strongly criticized because of the 
photograph. Does this not worry you? 
  [Franco] I did nothing hedonistic. I have more serious and 
grave things concerning the country to concern me. 
  [Carmo] Bahia State Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes even 
commented that in other times you would have been ousted. 
  [Franco] For falling in love? I would like to see him as a 
presidential candidate and hope he never gets involved in a 
similar episode. He has criticized the government a lot. In my 
opinion, one who criticizes so much is a suitable candidate not 
to the Senate but rather for the presidency of the Republic. 
The governor meets all the requirements to be the candidate for 
his party. 
  [Carmo] Why? 
  [Franco] He would solve all the Brazilian problems in no 
time 
if he were president. He should start campaigning publicly, not 
for the Senate but for the presidency. 
  [Carmo] Did you know she was wearing only a T-shirt? 
  [Franco] Nobody told me. How was I to know? I couldn't ask 
her that sort of question. I couldn't ask if her knickers were 
read, black, yellow, pink. 
  [Carmo] If you had known? 
  [Franco] What could I have done? Lend her a pair? I did not 
have a spare pair with me. 
  [Carmo] Were you upset by the fact that she let journalists 
listen into a conversation you held? 
  [Franco] No. She is a lovely woman. 
  [Carmo] Are you madly in love? 
  [Franco] You only fall madly in love once in your life. 
  [Carmo] But do you think this could have been a second time? 
  [Franco] I don't know. I am not saying so; it could have 
been the case. There may even be a second time. You are 
talking too much about my private life. Leave the girl alone. 
  [Carmo] Had you met her before? 
  [Franco] I knew her as an actress and model. 
  [Carmo] But she is not known for this. 
  [Franco] [does not answer] 
  [Carmo] Is Lilian Ramos the reason for your good mood? 
  [Franco] The street spirit does one good. The simplicity of 
the people, their good wishes, relaxed attitude, and warmth. I 
too felt all that in Rio. 
  [Carmo] During the past few days you have granted several 
interviews and appeared in public quite often. Is this a new 
strategy? 
  [Franco] The media does not understand that the president 
respects those who surround him. The media has created an image 
of isolation and solitude. You are unfair to me. I have not 
changed at all. 
  [Carmo] With the inflation rate. 
  [Franco] We did not invent inflation, misery. The people are 
suffering. Do you think we invented that problem? Quite the 
contrary, we established that 32 million people are living in 
absolute poverty. 
  [Carmo] Do you think salaries should be adjusted according 
to 
the highest URV (Real Value Unit) of the past 12 months? 
  [Franco] I am not going to answer that because it concerns 
the finance minister and his team. 
  [Carmo] Will those public servants who were dismissed by 
Collor's administration be reinstated? 
  [Franco] I will study this and the filling of ministry 
vacancies over the next few days in Juiz de Fora. 
  [Carmo] When will you announce the names of the new mines 
and 
energy and communications ministers? 
  [Franco] I will meet on 27 February with PMDB [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party] President Luiz Henrique to make this 
decision. I want a technician in the Communications Ministry, 
so Djalma Moraes may remain in that post. 
  [Carmo] Why did you say that you too chanted the slogan that 
inflation must drop? 
  [Franco] The president is also a victim of inflation, 
misery, 
poverty. The simplest citizen can see this. Why would I want a 
40 percent inflation rate? Moreover, I will tell Fernando that 
the inflation dragon has just paraded along the avenue. The 
media believes it is easy to curb inflation but the people 
understand; they know it is not an easy job. I did not invent 
inflation and hunger during the past two years. 
  [Carmo] What about Carnival, was it good? 
  [Franco] Carnival in Rio was wonderful. It is a popular 
festivity, the opportunity for the Brazilian people to regain 
their self-esteem. 
  [Carmo] Do you believe a president should celebrate Carnival 
at the Sambodromo [Carnival parade ground in Rio de Janeiro]? 
  [Franco] I do. I am a president who went to the Sambodromo 
to watch the Carnival celebrations with great joy. 
  [Carmo] You have earned yourself a name for having an affair 
on the avenue. 
  [Franco] I did not have an affair. 
  [Carmo] Did you flirt? 
  [Franco] No. 
  [Carmo] If Lilian asked you to get involved with her, would 
you accept? 
  [Franco] Let her ask me. I do not discuss one woman with 
another woman. 
  [Carmo] Did you feel the photographs invaded your privacy? 
  [Franco] I always feel my privacy is being invaded. 
  [Carmo] Do you think you will only be able to find a 
girlfriend after your mandate is over? 
  [Franco] Stop that. Please, my private life is my own.
