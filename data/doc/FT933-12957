FT  21 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Argyll weakens
There was yet more gloomy news on the food retailing sector as Argyll, which
owns the Safeway supermarket chain, made a disappointing trading statement.
The shares had risen in pre-market trading on hopes of higher than expected
sales.
While these were largely in line with market forecasts, they were
accompanied by a warning from the company that: 'Sales inflation influenced
in part by the highly competitive trading conditions continues at record low
levels.' Market pessimism at food price inflation levels, combined with
tighter margins, had led to several downgradings of the sector in recent
weeks.
Yesterday, Argyll declined 11 to 302p, its lowest level for 18 months, in
turnover of 7.1m. Kwik Save shed 7 to 670p, J. Sainsbury 8 to 450p and Tesco
5 to 204p.
