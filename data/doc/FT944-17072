FT  10 OCT 94 / Company News (This Week): UAP's advance to be held back by
Worms - Other companies
Union des Assurances de Paris, one of France's largest insurance groups, is
due to publish interim results on Wednesday, with some analysts predicting
profits up slightly to FFr1.1bn-FFr1.3bn (Dollars 200m-Dollars 240m). It
made FFr1.1bn in the first half last year. Profits on insurance may be
dragged down slightly by continuing - though smaller - losses at Banque
Worms. There will be no reflection in the results of recent acquisitions,
including Provincial, the UK non-life company, and the outstanding shares in
Colonia, the German insurer.
