  [Text] Berlin -- A fascist group in Berlin, which calls 
itself "Weissensee Aryan Resistance" (WAW), threatens Gregor 
Gysi and all "Reds" and "asylum-seekers" with murder. 
  A threatening letter that the Weissensee district office of 
the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] received by mail on 
Monday morning [3 January], says: "Beat them to death," "beat 
the communists to death," "the time has come finally for us to 
fight back so that Germany wakes up." The letter demands that 
the building in Weissensee be cleared out by the end of January, 
"otherwise what the asylum-seekers in the Weissensee 
asylum-seekers' hostel have already experienced will occur." 
Last summer a hand grenade attack was carried out at the 
hostel. At that time, police investigated "unknown 
perpetrators." The district mayor and the police denied that 
the deed had a fascist background. 
  The PDS has filed a complaint against this group with the 
police "for threats." PDS Land Chairwoman Petra Pau stated that 
this threatening letter is the climax so far in a chain of 
attacks on PDS institutions. The "WAW" has become active in 
Berlin for the first time. At a national level a group called 
"White Aryan Resistance" is known.
