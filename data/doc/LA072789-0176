DIGEST: BOARD OF EDUCATION ELECTS ITS FIRST LATINO PRESIDENT 
The Long Beach Board of Education has elected its first Latino president. She 
is Jenny Oropeza, 31, a professional political aide who just completed her 
freshman year on the board. The action was taken as Harriet Williams, a board 
member since 1979, concluded her one-year term as president. Karin Polacheck, 
another freshman member, was elected board vice president. 
Williams was the only member of the previous board to survive last year's 
switch from citywide elections to elections by geographical district. Oropeza, 
who represents the area including downtown Long Beach, the central area, Signal 
Hill and part of the east side, was swept into office along with other 
first-timers Polacheck, Jerry Shultz and Bobbie Smith. 
Oropeza had served as board vice president under Williams. 
The board asked its staff to prepare a recommendation for consideration later 
this summer that would establish a line of succession by which future board 
vice presidents would automatically ascend to the presidency.
