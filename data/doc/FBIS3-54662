  [Text] Foreign Minister Trivimi Velliste comments to 
correspondent Uku Toom on the latest statements in connection 
with the withdrawal of Russian forces from Estonia. As is 
known, Russia has expressed a readiness to withdraw the forces 
from Estonia by 31 August 1994. 
  [Begin recording] [Toom] How do you assess that statement by 
Svirin [head of the Russian delegation for talks with Estonia on 
troop withdrawal] that Russia has already presented to Estonia a 
schedule of withdrawal of forces on 2 (?September)? 
  [Velliste] This corresponds to the truth, altogether, and 
Svirin has improvised a little on the theme of the schedule, 
that he has, by word of mouth, presented (?some considerations) 
approximately when [word indistinct] could go. But this has 
been a very approximate guidance, nothing has been put in 
writing and presented on paper. 
  [Toom] The Estonian Progress Party held a news conference 
and 
expressed doubts on the subject of all these talks. The 
Progress Party somehow casts suspicion about some kind of secret 
protocols with these talks, that Russia has demanded something 
as compensation for the withdrawal of forces, and that Estonia 
has probably promised in connection with, for example, the 
forces' pensioners. 
  [Velliste] If there was a secret protocol it would very 
quickly be revealed. There is no (?reason for) [word 
indistinct] in a democratic state. We have not a single 
essential thing that would not reach the newspapers, [words 
indistinct] (?in the nearest time) newspapers. Some kind of 
secret protocol could, in general, (?be checked) [words 
indistinct] living in a democratic state. [end recording]
