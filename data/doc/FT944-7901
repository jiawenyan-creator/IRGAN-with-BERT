FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Christiania Bank sells part of
loan portfolio
Christiania Bank, Norway's second largest bank, has disposed of one-third of
the bank's loss-making US fisheries loan portfolio in Seattle.
Although terms of the deal were not disclosed, the bank agreed to sell Trust
Company of the West one-third of the troubled portfolio, estimated at
Dollars 323.5m in December.
As a result the portfolio has been reduced to Dollars 127m and the bank's
exposure to the fishing industry on the north-west coast of the US has been
reduced.
Christiania said it would not now have to report further loan-loss
provisions for the fourth quarter, as it had warned earlier this month.
The bank said international loans to the fisheries sector, particularly in
Seattle, constituted the most troubled sector of its overall loan portfolio.
About 94 per cent of the loan portfolio sold was classified as
non-performing or doubtful loans, according to the bank's
risk-classification system.
It said it intended to reduce the net loan portfolio in Seattle to about
Dollars 100m.
In the third quarter, Christiania made provisions of NKr93m to cover
fisheries loan losses which, for the nine-month period of this year, reached
NKr384m.
