FT  19 MAR 92 / Armenia declares emergency
Armenia has declared a state of emergency because of a growing economic
crisis caused by civil strife and a blockade by Azerbaijan, Armenian radio
said yesterday, Reuter reports.
The announcement came as leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia scrapped peace
talks proposed for this week, casting fresh doubt on prospects for settling
the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, a disputed enclave populated mostly by
ethnic Armenians but surrounded and administered by Azerbaijan.
In a statement, monitored by the BBC, the republic's foreign ministry
yesterday called on the international community to persuade Azerbaijan to
end the blockade.
The dispute coupled with civil strife in Georgia to the north has virtually
closed Armenia's supply routes for months, starving it of the oil and gas it
needs to generate electricity, the fuel it needs to run vehicles and the
food it imports for its 3m people.
