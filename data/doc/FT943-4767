FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Wates City drops down to Pounds 1.3m loss
The slow recovery in the commercial property market continued to exact a
toll on Wates City of London Properties, which yesterday reported an interim
pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.3m against a profit of Pounds 900,000.
The company attributed part of the fall to charging rather than capitalising
interest in its associated companies, where losses increased from Pounds
159,000 to Pounds 1.9m.
Operating profits for the six months to end June dropped 51 per cent to
Pounds 2.79m (Pounds 5.68m). The loss per share came out at 1.01p, compared
with earnings of 0.43p.
Again, no interim dividend was recommended and the board said it did not
expect to pay one for the full year.
Mr John Nettleton, managing director, said the downturn was a result of the
company's strategy of selling its income producing properties in favour of
keeping its development interests.
'We continue to believe that there will be a strong upturn in the property
cycle when our policies will be vindicated.' He added that several large
developments would begin producing rental income over the next 12 months.
