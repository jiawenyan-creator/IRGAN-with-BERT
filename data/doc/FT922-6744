FT  22 MAY 92 / Afghan leaders sign agreement
RIVAL Afghan guerrilla factions announced an accord yesterday to pull back
their forces and abandon war as a means of solving problems, AP reports from
Kabul.
The agreement, negotiated by a neutral guerrilla party, also created a
peacekeeping force. It banished from the interim government all high-ranking
members of the ousted Communist regime.
The accord, however, still did not address a knot of political differences
between guerrilla factions led by the Islamic fundamentalist Mr Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar and Mr Ahmed Shah Masood, defence minister.
