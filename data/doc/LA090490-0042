VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MEINERS OAKS; 
PLAN FOR GOLF COURSE RAISES WATER FEARS 
The Farmont Corp.'s pursuit of Ventura River water for a proposed golf course 
near Lake Casitas has alarmed small water companies in the Ojai Valley. 
Farmont's plan to tap the dry river's underground basin especially threatens 
the Meiners Oaks County Water District, said Ron Singleton, district general 
manager. 
"We're very concerned and we are in opposition to any more well drilling," 
Singleton said. "That basin is running dry. Any more wells will drain it for 
everyone." 
The water district relies on four river-bottom wells to serve 5,000 Meiners 
Oaks residents, Singleton said, and it has already felt a drain from pumping 
that Farmont began last year in a formerly inactive well. 
"We certainly don't want to get into a water war," said Lindsay F. Nielson, a 
Ventura attorney and Farmont spokesman. "There are multiple sources of water 
available for us, but water is obviously a major concern." 
The Farmont Corp., formed by Japanese media mogul Kagehisa Toyama, is seeking 
county permits to build an 18-hole golf course on 203 acres west of the Rancho 
Matilija subdivision off California 150. 
The corporation owns about 2,000 acres of the Rancho Matilija land grant, 
including half of the dry river bottom and 150 acres of citrus groves along the 
western bank. It also owns the formerly inactive Rancho Matilija Mutual Water
