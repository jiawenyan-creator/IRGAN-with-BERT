FT  16 SEP 93 / Major offers wage rise hope to lower-paid
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday held out the prospect that some public-sector
workers will get pay rises next year in spite of warnings of a freeze in the
public-sector pay bill from the chancellor of the exchequer.
The prime minister said there was scope for salary rises for some lower-paid
workers.
Speaking in the Midlands yesterday following private meetings with party
activists, Mr Major said public expenditure had to be restrained to maintain
low inflation.
He warned public-sector workers that they might have to settle for little or
no increase next year so that the government could maintain spending 'to
protect people who are vulnerable' without resorting to further borrowing.
He added: 'Some areas of expenditure have had to increase, but the overall
pay bill cannot rise.'
He was speaking in Loughborough, where he opened a Pounds 30m chemistry
laboratory at the Fisons pharmaceutical company.
Earlier he urged party activists in Birmingham and Telford to unite behind
the Tory leadership as it pursued a policy of low inflation and steady
growth.
His constituency tour was overshadowed by the news that local Conservative
associations had failed to meet their fundraising targets.
The 63 Tory associations in the West Midlands raised Pounds 105,482 in the
past financial year against a target of more than Pounds 280,000.
Local party leaders blamed the shortfall on disenchantment with government
policy.
Mr Major faced questions over the handling of new fiscal measures,
particularly VAT on domestic fuel. Mr Bernard Zissman, Tory leader on
Birmingham City Council, said that during frank exchanges the prime minister
was told the government should have announced measures to help the elderly
and less well off in the Budget.
