Laser Beams"--first paragraph is L'USINE NOUVELLE introduction" 
  [Text] Synthetic diamond membranes that are excellent 
polarizing filters enhance the quality of laser utilization. 
  In the near future, a new technology will become available 
to 
users of CO[.sub]2[/] lasers, to improve welding quality or 
cutting precision. They will owe it to ultrathin 
synthetic-diamond membranes developed by a university team. In 
fact, researchers at the Paris-Nord university at Villetaneuse 
just showed that a stack of several of these membranes would 
form a remarkable polarizing filter perfectly suitable for 
high-power lasers. 
<H5>  A Veritable "Cross" </H5>
  A laser beam consists of light waves associated with an 
electric field perpendicular to the propagation axis. The 
electric field possesses one horizontal and one vertical 
component. Polarization consists in favoring one of the 
components. 
  Until now, multikilowatt-laser users would make do with 
bulky 
and hard-to-adjust kaleidoscopes to mix polarizations in a 
random manner and achieve a consistent average effect. 
  The invention of this polarizing membrane filter is the 
result of a "cross" between two basic research branches. At the 
Paris-Nord university at Villetaneuse, two teams work a few 
hundred meters from each other, in entirely different fields. 
First, the team headed by Alix Gicquel, researcher at the 
materials engineering and high-pressure laboratory, an expert in 
synthetic diamond deposition; second, Christian Chardonnet, 
researcher at the Villetaneuse laser physics laboratory of the 
CNRS [National Center for Scientific Research], a specialist of 
advanced molecular research. 
  After hearing about Alix Gicquel's team's research on 
diamond 
membranes, Christian Chardonnet thought of testing them with the 
ultra-stable CO[.sub]2[/] lasers that are routinely used in 
his laboratory. Results were quick to follow. Compared with 
germanium filters, which until now were considered as the ne 
plus ultra of polarizing filters, the new system, consisting of 
six membranes, is 100 times more efficient. Better still, the 
1-micron thick diamond film does not bend the laser beam. A 
realignment device is no longer needed. "The excellent thermal 
conductivity characteristics of diamond, 20 times better than 
those of copper, lead us to expect a particularly high 
permissible power threshold," Christian Chardonnet indicated. 
Tests should soon be made on a multikilowatt CO[.sub]2[/] 
laser. So far, only zinc selenide lenses can withstand powers 
greater than 100 watt, but exceeding 1 kilowatt is out of the 
question. Besides, they are 1,000 times less efficient. 
  Christian Chardonnet's polarizing filter is not suitable 
just 
for CO[.sub]2[/] lasers. A slight thickness modification and 
an improvement in the roughness of the diamond window would make 
it possible to use the device for YAG [yttrium-aluminum garnet] 
lasers. A promising market! At the same time, diamond membranes 
can also protect infrared camera lenses. CO[.sub]2[/] laser 
beams, which have a wavelength of 10.6 microns, will be stopped 
by a set of crossed slats, while perfect transparency will be 
retained for wavelengths of 3 to 5 microns, the preferred range 
of these instruments. 
<H5>  The Secret of Diamond Filter Manufacture </H5>
  Making a 1-micron thick diamond membrane involves two 
stages. 
The synthetic diamond coating is deposited on a silicon plate, 
the central part of which is then chemically dissolved to leave 
only the diamond film. The team headed by Alix Gicquel, research 
at the materials engineering and high-pressure laboratory of the 
Paris-Nord university, at Villetaneuse, uses the microwave-aided 
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process to deposit the synthetic 
diamond film. The film is obtained from a gas mixture consisting 
of 99 percent hydrogen and 1 percent gaseous hydrocarbons. The 
gases are decomposed by an uptake of energy and form a plasma 
that contains mostly atomic hydrogen and hydrocarbon molecules. 
The latter contribute carbon, while hydrogen promotes the growth 
of diamond crystals and prevents the formation of graphite, 
which would pollute the film. To obtain very thin films, experts 
try to increase the number of crystals. One solution consists in 
immersing the substrate in an ultrasonically agitated bath 
containing fine diamond particles before going on to the 
chemical deposition stage.
