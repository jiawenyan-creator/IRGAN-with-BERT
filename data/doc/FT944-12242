FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Huntingdon fails to sell Travers and US
business
Shares of Huntingdon International Holdings fell 21p to 44p yesterday after
the life sciences group announced it had failed to sell Travers Morgan, its
UK-based consultancy, and its engineering and environmental services
business in the US.
Huntingdon said the annual results, to be published in December, were
expected to suffer from the costs of the abortive sales and provisions to
turn the businesses round. One analyst said that was likely to send the
group into the red.
In May the group announced that it planned to focus on its life sciences
business, having concluded that the other divisions did not have the
earnings prospects originally envisaged. It called in Kleinwort Benson, the
investment bank, to help with the sale of the businesses. But no purchase
could be concluded, forcing the management to consider other options.
Mr Christopher Cliffe, deputy executive chairman, described the news as
'very disappointing'. He said Huntingdon was making a huge effort to return
both groups to profitability. This would include the closure and sale of
offices and job losses.
Travers Morgan is an international consulting firm specialising in
engineering, management, transport and environment with a workforce of 850.
Its profits fell from Pounds 1.23m to Pounds 343,000 in the six months to
June. The US businesses employ 1,750 people and recorded an operating loss
of Pounds 388,000 in the first half.
In the nine months to June 30, group pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 4.34m
to Pounds 1.26m, while revenue, net of subcontracts, fell from Pounds 115.6m
to Pounds 109.2m.
