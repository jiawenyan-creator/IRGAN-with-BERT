FT  18 AUG 93 / Observer: Living down
UK telly-addicts rejoice] Next month brings a brand new 20th channel, if
boredom is setting in with the other 19. A paltry selection, perhaps,
compared with the 150 on offer in New York, but this one is worth waiting
for.
UK Living is aimed at women aged between 25 and 45 from socio-economic
classes C1, C2 and D. 'What do women in the 1990s want?' asks an
enthusiastic Paul Styles, on secondment from KPMG Peat Marwick. 'They want
reality, they want romance, to get in touch with their better feelings.'
But what do they get? Reruns of BBC TV chat shows; US soaps and dramas; a
new game show featuring bickering couples; and an item called Polly on the
Trolley, with prizes.
