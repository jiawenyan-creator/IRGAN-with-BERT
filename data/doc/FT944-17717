FT  06 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico
Still depressed by political uncertainty and influenced by the Wall Street
gyrations, Mexican share prices staged a further early slide before
recov-ering some ground. Bargain hunting prevailed later in the day in a
market that has seen seven losses in the last eight sessions.
The IPC index, 2.9 per cent lower at one stage, closed 28.63 or 1.07 per
cent off at 2,641.39.
