 

A. Estimated Emissions Impact of Proposed Regulation 


The emission standards proposed in today's action should 
reduce average per-engine HC and CO emission from small SI 
engines by 32 percent and 14 percent, respectively, by the year 
2020, when complete fleet turnover is projected. This would 
result in annual nationwide reductions of roughly 350,000 tons of 
HC and 2,000,000 tons of CO by the year 2020. In-use NO

emission rates are expected to increase, roughly, from 7,000 to 
34,000 tons per year. This increase represents one quarter of 
one percent of the national NO

X

 inventory, and is small compared 
to the substantial NO

X

 reductions achieved in the nonroad large 
CI proposal (58 FR 28809). 
In addition to control of HC, the proposed standards should 
be effective in reducing emissions of air toxics, including 
benzene and 1,3-butadiene. However, the magnitude of reduction 
would depend on whether the control technology reduces the 
individual toxics in the same proportion to total hydrocarbons. 
These emission reduction estimates for HC and CO are based 
on population projections using estimates of annual engine 
consumption (that is, sales), engine attrition (that is, 
scrappage), activity indicator, and current and proposed in-use 
emission factors. Data on activity indicators and the baseline 
emission factors were obtained from the Nonroad Study. Estimates 
of annual engine consumption for years from 1973 to 1992 were 
based on engine consumption data available from the PSR databases 
and industry data from OPEI,

 PPEMA,

 and Booz Allen  
Hamilton.

 Future consumption estimates are for the most part 
based on estimates of population growth for the United States. 
Attrition rates (that is, likelihood, as a function of engine 
age, that an engine remains in service) for all engines included 
in this analysis were developed on the assumption that equipment 
attrition is described by a two-parameter form of the Weibull 
cumulative distribution function.

For the analysis summarized in Tables 2 and 3, the emission 
inventories were developed for the five regulated engine classes 
as well as for all pieces of equipment using engines covered by 
this proposed rule. Using estimated engine consumption and 
attrition, EPA projected the total in-service engine population 
for each year from 1973 through 2020. EPA projected the total 
annual nationwide HC, CO, and NO

X

 emissions from small SI engines 
included in the current proposal under the baseline (that is, no 
controls applied) and controlled scenarios. 
For the controlled scenario, EPA assumed that new engines 
sold beginning in 1996 would meet the proposed standards. For 
both scenarios, in-use emission rates were determined so as to 
account for deterioration by adjusting the difference between new 
engine and in-use engine emission rates by a factor which is a 
function of age of the specific engine and its B50 or median 
life expressed in years.
