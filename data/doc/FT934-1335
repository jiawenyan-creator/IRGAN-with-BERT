FT  20 DEC 93 / Lift maker hopeful of take-off
Otis, the world's largest lift manufacturer, is hoping to expand its share
of the UK market through a new British-designed range of standard lifts,
Andrew Baxter writes.
The US-owned group unveiled the range - which cost Pounds 70m to develop -
last week in a move that is likely to intensify competitive pressure in the
UK lift market.
Mr John Leingang, chief executive of Otis in the UK, said the new range
could significantly increase its share of the market for 'model' or standard
lifts.
He said the UK lift industry had been badly hit by the construction industry
recession and the market for model lifts - used in everything from social
housing to low-rise offices - had been flat for 12 to 18 months.
