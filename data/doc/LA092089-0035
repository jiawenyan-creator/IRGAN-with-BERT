Weekly sections for Glendale and Ventura County are also supervised from the 
Valley Edition offices in Chatsworth and will be among Rawitch's 
responsibilities. 
Rawitch's professional activities have included membership on the national 
board of the Society of Professional Journalists, the presidency of its Los 
Angeles chapter and the chairmanship of the California Freedom of Information 
Committee.
