FT  31 JAN 94 / Venezuela defence minister dropped
The decision by Venezuela's president-elect, Mr Rafael Caldera, to replace
the minister of defence and the military high command caused an angry public
response from the outgoing defence chief at the weekend, raising fears of a
new military confrontation in the country.
The outgoing minister, Vice-Adm Radames Munoz Leon, said that he and the
high command were 'humiliated' by the president-elect. The admiral warned
this would cause splits in the military.
He noted that the high command had consistently supported democracy but he
expressed concern at what the new, 'precarious government' would do. Mr
Caldera won the presidency last month with only 30 per cent of the vote in a
poll with a 40 per cent abstention rate.
Vice-Adm Munoz said that he and the other six members of the military high
command would formally resign today. The incoming government has announced
that the new minister will be an army officer, Maj-Gen Rafael Montero
Revette.
Mr Caldera, 78, who is to be inaugurated as president on Wednesday, seems to
have decided to change the high command so as to give his government a fresh
image. However, the move was seen as an unnecessary shock while Venezuela is
in a period of political instability.
In 1992 there were two coup attempts. Last year a wave of bombings hit the
capital and political upheaval attended the fall of President Carlos Andres
Perez, who faces corruption charges.
