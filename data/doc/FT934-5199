FT  01 DEC 93 / Bush at palace for knighthood
Former US President George Bush was yesterday awarded an honorary knighthood
by the Queen. The announcement came as Mr Bush and his wife were attending a
lunch at Buckingham Palace.
Mr Bush, in Britain on a private visit, was honoured with the Knight Grand
Cross of the Order of the Bath - a rare award also bestowed on his
predecessor Ronald Reagan.
Like all foreigners, he will be barred from adopting the title 'Sir' but is
able to wear the insignia and use the initials GCB after his name.
The award, at the recommendation of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
marks the government's close relationship with the Bush administration,
particularly during the Gulf war in 1991.
The Foreign Office said the award was made with the full approval of US
President Bill Clinton.
A spokesman added: 'It is unusual, but not unprecedented, for the Queen to
present the honorary award herself. President Reagan was another who
received his in person.'
The two presidents are among the few Americans to have received the award
since the end of the second world war, when six US military commanders were
honoured.
