NOT ALL POETRY READINGS CREATED EQUAL 
It's always gratifying to see media coverage on the live poetry phenomenon, and 
each story helps inform readers and gives support to the region's poets. 
Because poets do get so little attention, however, it's all the more important 
that the journalist not misrepresent any details. 
In Rose Apodaca's recent article ("Readings, Writings and Libations," Nov. 15, 
OC LIVE!), I suspect she proposed an article about Performance Poetry, then 
felt obliged to slip pegs of various sizes through a single hole. 
 Stand Up Poetry, for instance, has never been synonymous with Performance 
Poetry. Charles Webb took pains to explain this in his introduction to the 
"Stand Up" anthology and in his conversation with Apodaca. 
This bold, insurgent movement, sparked by formally trained poets who broke from 
the beaten path, is starting to be recognized by many in other parts of the 
country as one of the most distinctive, unignorable events happening in poetry 
today. 
Therefore, it's important not to cloud and confuse the issue on the home front. 
One more small point: The Los Angeles Poetry Festival did not take place 
because of the popularity of Performance Poetry, but because of the popularity 
of many kinds of poetry being written in Southern California. 
Remember, the simple act of reading a poem aloud before an audience does not 
necessarily identify one as a Performance poet, or Stand Up poet.
