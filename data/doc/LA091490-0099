ACC APPROVES MOVE TO INVITE FLORIDA STATE TO BECOME MEMBER 
The Atlantic Coast Conference voted Thursday to invite Florida State to join 
the eight-team league. 
Officials said the details of membership will be communicated to Florida State 
over the next few days, but no deadline has been set for a decision by the 
school. 
"Our conference has deliberated at length about expansion," ACC Commissioner 
Gene Corrigan said. "The process has been comprehensive and thorough. We feel 
comfortable this decision is in the best interests of the member institutions 
of the ACC." 
Corrigan said Florida State had been an attractive candidate from the outset. 
"The more we learned about the institution, the more we felt they were a 
natural fit," he said. "Their academic and athletic programs are nationally 
recognized, and their addition would be a plus to our conference in every way. 
It would allow us to continue in a leadership position in intercollegiate 
athletics." 
ACC members are Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Duke, Wake Forest, North 
Carolina State, Clemson and Georgia Tech.
