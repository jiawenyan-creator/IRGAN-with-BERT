Imports charged to these category limits for the period February 1, 1994 through January 31, 1995 shall be charged
against those levels of restraint to the extent of any unfilled balances. In the event the limits established for that
period have been exhausted by previous entries, such goods shall be subject to the levels set forth in this directive.

The limits set forth above are subject to adjustment in the future pursuant to the provisions of the current bilateral
agreement between the Governments of the United States and the People's Republic of Bangladesh.

In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for
consumption to include entry for consumption into the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that these actions fall within the foreign
affairs exception of the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).

Sincerely,
