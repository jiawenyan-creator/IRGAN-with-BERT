SOUTHLAND; 
NIGHT STALKER WITNESS CALLED BACK 
Prosecutors in the Night Stalker trial received permission today to briefly 
reopen their case to re-question a witness they learned had not been entirely 
truthful in his testimony. 
Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan agreed to allow the prosecution to again 
question the witness Tuesday morning, postponing the opening of the defense's 
case until prosecutors were finished. "I'm told by the witness that something 
was withheld to protect a woman," Deputy Dist. Atty. P. Philip Halpin said. "It 
was a deliberate omission that amounts to an untruth." 
Halpin refused to divulge the witness's identity until the witness begins 
testifying. The prosecutor said the additional questioning should take about 10 
minutes and added that the witness's testimony will not be "earth-shattering."
