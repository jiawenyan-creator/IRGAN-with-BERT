MOVIES TO TAPE 
Hell's Angels (AMC Sunday at 1:45 p.m., again at 10 p.m.): Howard Hughes' 
legendary 1930 World War I saga is often hokey on the ground, but its sequences 
of aerial warfare are still among the most exciting ever shot. Jean Harlow is 
pretty hot stuff too. (2:05) 
Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Channel 7 Sunday at midnight): One of the best British 
films of the '70s, featuring a skittish triangle between a gay physician (Peter 
Finch), his bisexual lover (Murray Head) and Head's other lover (Glenda 
Jackson). (2:15) 
The Ghost Goes West (Channel 11 Monday at midnight): The delightful Rene Clair 
1936 classic in which an American businessman (Eugene Pallette) transports a 
castle to America, stone by stone, only to find that it is haunted (by a lively 
Robert Donat). Written by Robert Sherwood. (1:30) 
Patterns (Channel 11 Tuesday at midnight): Fielder Cook's 1956 film of the Rod 
Serling drama about a corporate power struggle, adapted from a landmark "Kraft 
Television Theatre" play. With Van Heflin, Everett Sloane and Ed Begley. (1:30) 
The Big Sleep (Channel 5 Friday at 3:10 a.m.): The terse, convoluted '40s 
classic, directed by Howard Hawks from the Raymond Chandler mystery, adapted by 
William Faulkner (among others). With Humphrey Bogart, the definitive Philip 
Marlowe, and a suitably sultry Lauren Bacall.
