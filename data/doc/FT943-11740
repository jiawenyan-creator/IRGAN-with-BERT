FT  28 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: IFC approves investment in
Peruvian fund
The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the
World Bank, has approved an equity investment in a new fund which will
enable international banks to exchange their holdings of Peruvian government
debt for shares in state-owned companies.
The IFC's investment will be for the cash equivalent of up to 12 per cent of
the total debt and cash commitments to the fund, which has a target size of
Dollars 250m of face value of Peruvian debt (around Dollars 110m at current
market value).
Debt is expected to make up around 70 per cent of the fund.
Over the past two years 20 Peruvian companies have been privatised, raising
around Dollars 2.5bn. By the end of its term in 1995, the government hopes
to have sold off 60 state-owned companies.
