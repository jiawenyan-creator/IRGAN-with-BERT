  [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS--Controversial leader of the 
Liberal-Democratic Party Vladimir Zhirinovskiy failed to make it 
to State Duma vice-presidency on Wednesday. 
  Four deputy chairmen of the Russian parliament's lower house 
were elected earlier, elections of the fifth one were held on 
Wednesday, but gave no result. Ten candidates were nominated for 
the vacant office in the beginning. Two of them withdrew their 
candidatures. 
  Zhirinovskiy and Artur Chilingarov, representative of the 
"New Regional Policy" faction, were at the head of the poll. 
However, none of them managed to win a majority of the total 
number of votes at the decisive run of the poll. 
  According to Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the parliament's lower 
house, Duma factions should now "hold (joint) consultations to 
specify when the elections of the fifth deputy chairman should 
be put on the agenda once more".
