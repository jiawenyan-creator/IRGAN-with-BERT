Passports and cigarettes (invaluable for barter) aren't the only things that 
pop stars apparently feel are essential when heading to Russia. 
There are also video crews and recording equipment. Elton John, Billy Joel, Bon 
Jovi and the Scorpions have either recorded live albums or made documentaries 
during their Soviet excursions. For this concert documentary, the footage isn't 
much more involving than something you'd expect if one of the members of this 
gently soulful English reggae-pop group took along his own video camera. But 
UB40 isn't a particularly dynamic act live, so the non-concert scenes (mostly 
elementary sightseeing) add a welcome, if still limited visual diversion.
