SHORT CRUISES OUT OF L.A. HARBOR CAN HELP TRAVEL DOLLAR GO FURTHER 
It's no news that consumers are cutting back on spending. All of us, it seems, 
have less discretionary income these days, and we're becoming more cautious 
about parting with our money. 
What is a revelation is that vacations are one thing that people are not giving 
up, at least according to such statistical soothsayers as the U.S. Travel Data 
Center, Travel Industry Assn. of America, Travel Industry Indicators and Cruise 
Lines International. 
Their consensus is that while vacationers might have become more frugal -- 
going from luxury to economy, for instance -- or might have cut down on the 
duration of their holidays, vacations remain at the top of people's "must-do" 
list. 
Escape has almost become a necessity. More than ever, there's a need to get 
away, to reduce stress by leaving home, work and responsibility behind, even if 
it is for just a few days. 
Weekend vacations climbed 28% between 1984 and 1989, and indications are that 
this year the figure will climb even higher. The trend toward quickie getaways 
may not only be due to cost-cutting effortsbut also to the time crunch faced by 
an ever-increasing number of two-income households with conflicting family 
schedules. 
Hottest on the list of those shopping for brief reprieves are short cruises. 
Last year, 85% of the more than 3 million Americans who took cruises sailed for 
seven days or less, with an increasing number on three- and four-day sailings, 
according to Cruise Lines International. 
For Los Angelenos, short cruises are an even better bargain than for those 
living inland since air fares on fly-sail packages can be eliminated. If you're 
among the thousands who are focusing on value for a weekend high-seas getaway, 
here's a list of what's available locally (reservations may be made through 
most travel agents):
