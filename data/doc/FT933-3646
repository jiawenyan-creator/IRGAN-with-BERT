FT  13 SEP 93 / Newcastle counts social inequality
THE CONCENTRATION of unemployment and poverty in many parts of Newcastle
upon Tyne sits uncomfortably alongside the comparative affluence of some of
its suburbs, says City Profiles, a newly published analysis of the 1991
census results for the city.
Census data analysed by Newcastle city council shows stark contrasts between
different areas of the city, with unemployment ranging from 39 per cent in
the West City ward to 6 per cent in Westerhope. The city average is 15.3 per
cent.
The proportion of children in lone-parent households ranges from 43 per cent
in West City to 7 per cent in South Gosforth. The proportion of dependent
children in households with no earner in these wards is respectively 61 per
cent and 5 per cent.
Overall, 21 per cent of the city's under-16s are in single-parent households
and 29.5 per cent - 16,055 - are in households with no earned income.
Other sharp contrasts include car ownership, which ranges by ward from 74
per cent to 16 per cent, and owner occupancy which ranges from 84 per cent
to 8 per cent.
Mr Jeremy Beecham, leader of the Labour-controlled council, said: 'Ours is
an increasingly unequal city in an increasingly unequal country.'
The report says that Newcastle is generally worse off than most of England's
other 35 metropolitan districts, although it scores better than most for its
proportion of homes with central heating and low levels of overcrowding.
The number of children staying at school after 16 has risen since 1981.
According to the census data Newcastle ranks fourth among the 36 districts
for its levels of children in single-parent and non-earning households and
its male unemployment. Knowsley, Liverpool and Manchester rank higher.
