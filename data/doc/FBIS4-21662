  [Text] [Video shows archive footage of special security 
units training to defend nuclear cites, picketers outside Moscow 
Government house, trade union deputy chairman] 
Correspondent: Experts are already worried about the 
situation on Russian nuclear power stations. For example, it 
has become perfectly clear that the security system for 
strategic sites, which include nuclear power stations, will have 
to be completely rebuilt. Special services employees say that 
since the Ministry of Internal Affairs took over the command of 
the special group Vympel, which specializes in preventing any 
terrorist threat, this subunit has practically ceased to exist 
and there is no one to defend nuclear sites. 
  At the same time there is also many other problems. The 
state owes half a trillion rubles to employees of nuclear 
stations. This has forced them to send picketers to Moscow. 
The leadership of the nuclear industry trade unions says that 
nuclear power stations are experiencing difficulties not only 
with wages: 
  I. Fomichev, deputy chairman of the central committee 
of the nuclear industry trade union, identified by caption: 
"There is enough fuel for about a month." 
  Correspondent: A threat of stoppages by nuclear 
power stations means not only a loss of 12 percent of electric 
energy. For regions like Chukotka this is a question of life 
and death. 
  Only a law prohibiting strikes on strategic sites stops 
employees of nuclear power stations from going on strike. 
However, new demands have come from provinces on the last day 
of authorized pickets of state institutions in Moscow. 
  Fomichev: "Unfortunately, because the government 
continues to ignore our problems, the workforce is beginning to 
put forward political demands. Unfortunately the people we 
voted for, the people whose responsibility is to solve these 
problems, are not doing it."
