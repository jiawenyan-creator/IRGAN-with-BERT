JORDAN HAS STATISTICS TO RANK WITH THE BEST 
In reference to a Feb. 4 letter about Michael Jordan's selection to Scott 
Ostler's all-time NBA team: Who in their right mind would not name him to their 
all-time team? 
Last season alone, Jordan was league MVP, defensive player of the year, MVP of 
the All-Star game, slam dunk champion and steals leader, and he also earned his 
second consecutive scoring title. He is also the only player to score 50-plus 
points in three consecutive playoff games. 
But you're right, he's just a flash in the pan.
