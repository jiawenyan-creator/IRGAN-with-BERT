FT  27 AUG 92 / Festivals more needy of sponsors
ARTS FESTIVALS are becom-ing more dependent on business sponsorship as less
public money is made available, according to a report published yesterday.
The report, by the Policy Studies Institute, an independent research body,
was compiled from a survey of 527 arts festivals, and estimates that
festivals had a total income of Pounds 40.6m last year, with a total
expenditure of Pounds 40.9m. More than half said their most recent festival
incurred a deficit, and 13 per cent had an accumulated deficit.
Festival incomes ranged from Pounds 115 to more than Pounds 5.5m. The
largest source of funding for festivals is box-office receipts, which
provide 41 per cent of the total income. Just two festivals, the Edinburgh
International Festival and Glyndebourne Festival Opera, account for more
than a third of total box-office receipts.
General arts festivals are the most likely to attract business funding,
which provides an average 18 per cent of their income. Folk festivals were
the least successful in attracting business sponsorship, obtaining just 3
per cent of their income from that source.
The Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts said yesterday that the
amount of competition for business sponsorship funds had increased over the
past few years. 'Most businesses we deal with get between 35 and 100
applications for sponsorship a week,' the association said.
Total business sponsorship of the arts for the year to April 1991 was Pounds
57m. Figures for the year to April 1992 are not yet available, but the
association does not expect the total to drop below the figure for last
year.
