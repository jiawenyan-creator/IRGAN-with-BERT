  [Text] The Cypriot Government believes that British Foreign 
Minister Douglas Hurd will exert his influence to break the 
Turkish intransigence on the Cyprus issue during his visit to 
Ankara the day after tomorrow. 
  Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said today that the 
British foreign minister will not only refer to the 
confidence-building measures, but will also stress that the 
status quo in Cyprus is unacceptable and cannot continue.
