  [Text] Pinar del Rio, Havana, Guantanamo, Las Tunas, and 
Granma Provinces have achieved their annual Territorial Troops 
Militia [MTT] fund drive targets through worker's 
salary-allotment donations. 
  Every province, including the Isle of Youth, has achieved 
over 80 percent of their MTT goals. The fact that Havana 
Province reached its annual fund pledge through volunteer work 
should be highlighted. 
  The Cuban Workers Federation's report, which is current to 
May, reveals that the tobacco union is the only one that has 
completed its MTT fund drive. 
  Approximately 90 percent of the salary-allotment donations 
for financing the MTT come from the Revolutionary Armed Forces' 
civilian workers, commerce, restaurant, sugarcane, metal, 
electronic, food industry, education, and sports workers.
