<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2) it is making a financial assistance award
under Grant Number DE-FG0194CE15548 to Gentrex-Nevada, Inc. The proposed grant will provide funding in the
estimated amount of $97,351 by the Department of Energy for the purpose of saving energy through development of a foundation
insulation system, the ``Forms PLUS

TM

'' system of Mr. M. Dean Gardner, the inventor.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1) that the unsolicited application
for financial assistance submitted by Gentrex-Nevada, Inc., is meritorious based on the general evaluation required
by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and the proposed project represents a unique idea that would not be eligible for financial assistance
under a recent, current or planned solicitation. The inventor, Mr. M. Dean Gardner, who will be principal investigator,
will use his skills, experience and equipment to analyze an existing initial prototype, improve the prototype, and
test it in a wide range of climactic and construction conditions. For new construction annual savings are estimated
to be 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent. The proposed project is not eligible for financial assistance under a recent,
current or planned solicitation because the funding program, the Energy Related Invention Program (ERIP), has been
structured since its beginning in 1975 to operate without competitive solicitations because the authorizing legislation
directs ERIP to provide support for worthy ideas submitted by the public. The program has never issued and has no plans
to issue a competitive solicitation.
