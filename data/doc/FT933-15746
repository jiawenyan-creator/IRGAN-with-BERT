FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: Dutch bank increases presence in
Chicago
ABN Amro, the Dutch banking group, announced yesterday it was to increase
its presence in the Chicago retail banking market through the acquisition of
Cragin Financial Corp for about Dollars 500m in cash.
Cragin is the holding company for Cragin Federal Bank for Savings, which is
the second largest independent savings bank in Illinois, with assets of
Dollars 2.8bn and 27 offices in the Chicago area.
It will be integrated with ABN Amro's Chicago-based group of LaSalle banks,
which has assets of over Dollars 16bn in more than 40 offices.
LaSalle, a significant presence in the middle market for commercial loans,
increased its retail presence around Chicago when it acquired the Talman
savings and loans group in February 1992.
LaSalle said yesterday that the Cragin group of banks had the same product
lines as Talman and offered a good geographical fit with the earlier
acquisition.
Cragin's offices are mainly on Chicago's north-west side and in the western
and north-western suburbs.
ABN Amro's other US operations, with assets of about Dollars 40bn, include
lending to large corporations and EAB, a retail banking business based in
New York.
The Cragin deal, which is expected to close early next year, involves
payment of Dollars 38 a share to the holders of Cragin's approximately 13m
shares.
Shares in the holding company for Cragin Federal Bank for Savings were up
Dollars 9 7/8 at Dollars 35 at midday after peaking at Dollars 36, a new
high for the year.
Stet, the holding company which controls Italy's public sector
telecommunications activities, is selling a 20 per cent share in Stet Hellas
Telecommunications, its recently-created Greek subsidiary, to the US Nynex
group. Stet gave no indication of the value of the sale.
