Unity Bloc Is Cornel Brahas, Deputy of the Romanian National 
Unity Party"] 
  [Text] "In the first meeting of the National Unity Bloc 
[BUN] after its creation, both sides of the alliance [the 
Romanian National Unity Party (PUNR) and the Agrarian Democratic 
Party of Romania (PDAR)] agreed that this body should be led in 
the next six months by the PUNR," PDAR President Mr. Victor 
Surdu said. "At the same meeting, we elected the BUN 
leadership: Cornel Brahas, PUNR, becomes the executive 
president and Constantin Carbunaru, PDAR, the vice president," 
he added. 
  Yesterday afternoon, a meeting was held at the PUNR 
headquarters in the Chamber of Deputies on the way in which PUNR 
will participate in the negotiations with the Social Democracy 
Party of Romania [PDSR] on the future form of government. 
"Until now," Mr. Victor Surdu said, "PUNR had a mandate from us 
to negotiate with the PDSR on behalf of PDAR, too. At the next 
meeting with the ruling party, BUN will be present, that is the 
PDAR representatives, too."
