  [Text] Ankara, April 24 (A.A) -- Various democratic mass 
organizations, led by the Turkish Confederation of Trade Unions 
(Turk-Is) held a `meeting to protest high living costs and 
unemployment' here today. 
  During the meeting held in the Tandogan Square, laborers and 
civil servants carried such placards as `we oppose the closure 
of work-places', `we earned difficultly, can not give it away 
easily.' 
  Turk-Is leader Bayram Meral, addressing the crowd, said, `we 
shall exercise our power, including a general strike, if this 
government does not resolve your problems, does not remove the 
legislation of September 12 (military intervention), does not 
avail the right to organize under trade unions to civil 
servants.' 
  `If this government , this parliament removes bans on a 
pluralist system, then the laborers, the public employees will 
form their own party,' he said.
