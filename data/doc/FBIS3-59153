  [Text] Let us have a look at the first reactions to Silvio 
Berlusconi's statement [about entering politics]. Here is a 
report from Rocco Tolfa: 
  [Tolfa] Mario Segni tried to persuade Berlusconi not to 
enter the fray. Now that he has, Segni has said that his 
decision will not help the moderate grouping but make it more 
divided. 
  The Democratic Party of the Left spokesman in the Chamber of 
Deputies, Massimo d'Alema was curt: Berlusconi incites the 
hatred of one part of the country against another, and he is 
only raising his voice because he wants to conceal privileges 
and personal interests. 
  Spokesman for the Italian Popular Party Gerardo Bianco is 
also worried. He said: Berlusconi is the owner of a large news 
network. He ended by saying: There are risks for the proper 
functioning of democracy. He would have done better to continue 
in his role as a businessman. 
  Italian Republican Party secretary Giorgio La Malfa, in 
contrast, is neither pleased nor worried about Berlusconi's 
decision. 
  The Italian Social Democratic Party politician Ferri is 
pleased. He said: It is a positive thing and can help to build a 
liberal democratic grouping.
