  [Text] Bregovo Border Checkpoint, Vidin Region, February 4 
(BTA) -- Every day the Bregovo border checkpoint is jammed with 
long queues of motorcyclists. Over 400 motorcycles a day cross 
the border to Serbia. Their main business is fuel export. This 
trade is quite lucrative -- there are no restrictions regarding 
the number of motorcycles entering the former Yugoslavia. Some 
do this three times a day exporting an average of 50-60 litres 
of fuel. The more persevering -- those who cross the border 
three times a day, make a daily profit of about 2,000 leva. 
There are record holders -- some people from Bregovo make 17 
"trips" a day. 
  The lack of statutory documents restricting this type of 
trips has resulted in conflicts with the border officials 
working at Bregovo. On February 3 angry motorcyclists blocked 
the Bregovo checkpoint from 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. The conflict was 
solved temporarily. According to customs officers, such 
conflicts are bound to become more and more frequent in the 
absence of a categorical stand of the Customs Chief Department 
on restricted exit of motorcycles and other Bulgarian motor 
vehicles to the former Yugoslavia.
