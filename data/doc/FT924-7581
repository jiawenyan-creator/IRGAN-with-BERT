FT  16 NOV 92 / National Savings sales increase
GROSS SALES of National Savings products soared to Pounds 867m in October,
largely reflecting the popularity of two products which were withdrawn from
the market last week, Norma Cohen writes.
The highest contribution came from sales of Pounds 224m in the fifth issue
of Index-Linked Savings Certificates which offered a tax-free return of 4.5
per cent over inflation if held for five years. These were withdrawn from
the market on November 12 following Chancellor Norman Lamont's Autumn
Statement.
