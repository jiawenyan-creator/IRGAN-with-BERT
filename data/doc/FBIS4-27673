  [Text] North Korea, which is troubled by escaping loggers, 
broadcast an interesting report on 1 June through its Central 
Broadcast that lumber production in Russia has decreased 
drastically. 
  Quoting data from the Russian Federal Forestry Bureau, the 
broadcasting station reported that Russia's lumber production 
last year decreased to under 75 percent of that of 1992 and that 
the situation is worsening. 
  While analyzing the decrease of lumber production as a 
result 
of the financial difficulties of the enterprise concerned and 
the soaring transportation cost, the broadcasting station 
expressed concern over suspended production due to the workers' 
strike.
