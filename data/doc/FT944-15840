FT  17 OCT 94 / Asia: Ford and Mazda may link in Europe
Mr Alex Trotman, chairman and chief executive of Ford, the US vehicle maker,
said the group would decide 'within the next month' whether to produce cars
in Europe for sale under the Mazda badge.
Such a project has previously been rejected but it has been revived this
year following moves by Ford to establish a stronger influence over Mazda
management.
'We are studying again whether it is in our interests to give Mazda a
Ford-based vehicle in Europe,' said Mr Trotman. It would be 'a small
passenger car' and lead to higher levels of capacity utilisation at Ford
plants in Europe.
Mazda, which is 24.5 per cent owned by Ford, is the only one of the leading
Japanese carmakers without a car production base in Europe. Its sales in
west Europe have fallen by 10 per cent in the first 9 months this year
compared with a growth of 5 per cent in the overall market.
It is expected that a Mazda-badged Ford would be based on either the Ford
Fiesta or Ford Escort and built at one of Ford's European assembly plants in
Germany, the UK or Spain. Under a long established arrangement some Mazda
vehicles are sold under Ford badges in Asia. In Japan the Mazda 626 and the
Mazda 323/Familia are sold respectively as the Ford Telstar and the Ford
Laser.
Mr Trotman said that Mazda was unlikely to be used again to engineer a
mainstream car to be produced and sold by Ford in North America or Europe,
as was the case with the North American Ford Escort developed by Mazda.
'If we can design at the lowest cost and we have the human resources we will
do it,' he said. It was 'very likely' that the next generation Escort for
the European and North American markets would be developed by Ford in
Europe, he said.
