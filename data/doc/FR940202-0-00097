<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is amending the regulations concerning the licensing of pilots and the manning of vessels by pilots.
This interim final rule: Defines ``coastwise seagoing vessel'' for pilotage purposes; describes first class pilotage
areas where local pilotage expertise is warranted; allows licensed individuals to serve as pilots in areas not identified
as first class pilotage areas on vessels that they are otherwise qualified to control; requires a Federal pilot for
vessels in excess of 1,600 gross tons, propelled by machinery and subject to inspection under 46 U.S.C. chapter 33,
that are not authorized by their Certificate of Inspection to proceed beyond the Boundary Line; and provides quick
reference tables for Federal pilotage requirements. These changes are necessary to eliminate confusion over where
and on what vessels pilotage expertise is required.
