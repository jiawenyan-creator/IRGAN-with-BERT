  [Text] Paris, May 27 (BTA) -- "Bulgaria sees its 
participation in the Stability Pact for Europe as a means of 
integrating into the political and economic structures of 
Europe," Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said in 
his address at the Conference on Stability in Europe. 
  Mr. Daskalov said that stability is a complex problem that 
entails the overcoming of the economic difficulties some 
European countries are facing in the period of transition to a 
market economy, a Foreign Ministry spokesman told the national 
radio. The development of regional cooperation in a variety of 
spheres should therefore be an issue of priority within the 
framework of the process now being launched. 
  The Bulgarian foreign minister also said that the Stability 
Pact for Europe should be committed to the principles and norms 
of international law. All issues pertaining to minorities and 
European borders should be addressed on the basis of 
inviolability and respect for the existing borders, the 
territorial unity and sovereignty of the states and respect for 
the human rights of each individual, including those belonging 
to national, ethnic, religious and language groups.
