FT  10 JUN 92 / Economist at Bank proposes rates cuts
PROFESSOR Mervyn King, chief economist of the Bank of England, yesterday
suggested that members of the European exchange rate mechanism could bring
their interest rates below German levels in the next year.
In remarks that will fuel hopes of reductions in UK base rates from the
present 10 per cent, he said: 'There is no reason to suppose that D-Mark
interest rates necessarily represent the floor for short-term interest rates
within a fully credible ERM.'
Prof King predicted in a lecture in Rome that 'the theoretical proposition
that D-Mark rates do not have to be the floor in the ERM will be tested
empirically over the next year'.
Whether other countries' rates could fall below D-Mark rates was 'not a
question of high theory but of practice and market expectations,' he said.
It was a mistake to blame Germany in general and the Bundesbank in
particular for high short-term interest rates in Europe. Other EMS countries
had decided to maintain unchanged parities against the D-Mark after the
shock of German unification.
'Monetary constraints on countries other than Germany have, therefore,
largely been self-imposed in order to increase credibility in the long-term
commitment of ERM countries to price stability.'
Prof King challenged the belief that high short-term rates were preventing
economic recovery in Europe. He pointed out that much investment and some
consumption depended on long-term rates, which need not be incompatible with
rapidgrowth.
Long-term rates may reflect expectations of profits from investment that
lead to higher consumption and lower saving. 'In these circumstances, higher
interest rates are a symptom of good news.'
