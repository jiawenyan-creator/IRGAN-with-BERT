BRIEFLY 
Changes at US Sprint Parent: United Telecom said it will exercise its option to 
buy GTE's remaining 19.9% stake in what originally was a 50-50 joint venture 
that created US Sprint in July, 1986. The firm now owns 80.1% of US Sprint, 
which has become the nation's third-largest long-distance carrier. Shareholders 
at United Telecom's annual meeting in Kansas City, Mo., also overwhelmingly 
approved changing the parent firm's name to Sprint Corp. to capitalize on the 
subsidiary's more widely recognized name.
