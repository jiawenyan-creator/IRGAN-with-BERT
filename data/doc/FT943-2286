FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: IBM pins PC hopes on new
home-use products
International Business Machines (IBM) is pinning its hopes of regaining
leadership of the personal computers market on its new products aimed at
home users.
The Aptiva multimedia PC is the first of three new product lines that IBM is
preparing for market. Two more are expected next month.
The products will be backed by the company's biggest ever advertising
campaign, a spend of Dollars 100m over the next three months, with Dollars
20m dedicated specifically to Aptiva.
The marketing blitz is designed not only to boost sales but also to help IBM
to rebuild its image as an industry leader. Over the past six months IBM has
slipped to fourth place in US PC sales from first place last year, overtaken
by Compaq Computer, Apple Computer and Packard Bell.
Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman, this year hired Mr Rick Thoman, a colleague
at RJR Nabisco and American Express, to reinvigorate its PC operations. The
product lines will be the first test of his new approach to PC marketing.
The Aptiva PCs are aimed at the growing consumer market, and follow last
week's launch by Compaq Computer of a new line of consumer PCs. IBM is
offering a wider price range than Compaq, from about Dollars 1,200 to
Dollars 2,600, including two models based on Intel's highest performance
Pentium microprocessors. Intel last week began its own Dollars 80m
consumer-oriented advertising campaign for Pentium-based PCs.
The Aptiva range includes multimedia capabilities, such as a CD-ROM player
and speakers, as standard. It can also take telephone messages or receive a
fax, 'waking up' when the telephone rings, whether or not the machine is
turned on.
A 'scheduler' also allows the home PC user to program the Aptiva PC to turn
itself on and perform pre-selected functions, such as playing a music CD or
sending fax messages overnight.
