<F P=106> [Interview with Riak Machar, "leader of the Unified Sudanese </F>
People's Liberation Movement," by Nizar Daww-al-Na'im in London; 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Daww-al-Na'im] Whom did you meet in Britain 
and what is the nature of your visit? 
  [Machar] I have come to London on a private visit for the 
eulogy of my wife Emma (a British citizen killed in a road 
accident in Nairobi). All my meetings were on the basis that 
this is a private visit. I have met with some lords and members 
of parliament. [passage omitted] 
  [Daww-al-Na'im] What foreign role do you seek for the 
settlement of the Sudanese problem? 
  [Machar] I believe that Britain can spearhead efforts in 
support of the current Kenyan-led initiative and if that 
initiative does not succeed then Britain and the European Union 
states could play a part and perhaps take the entire issue to 
the United Nations. [passage omitted] 
  [Daww-al-Na'im] What do you expect of the initiative of the 
IGADD (Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development) 
states led by Kenya? This is an initiative by heads of state 
who deal with the Sudanese Government as a government like 
theirs and deal with you as rebels. What are the chances of 
success for such an initiative? 
  [Machar] I expect a lot from these states because they are 
our neighbors and they sense and are affected by our problem 
whether through the exodus of refugees or instability on the 
borders. Some of these states, like Eritrea and Ethiopia, are 
on good terms with Khartoum. True, they treat us as a rebellion 
and treat Khartoum as a government but there is no other way. 
So long as Khartoum and the two wings of the Sudanese People's 
Liberation Movement [SPLM] have accepted the initiative, the 
chances of making progress seem to be good. [passage omitted] 
  [Daww-al-Na'im] Will the two wings of the movement go to the 
negotiations as one delegation? 
  [Machar] We expect the two wings to go as one united 
delegation because we have a joint program for negotiation based 
on the movement's target which is self-determination for the 
people of southern Sudan and peripheral areas. [passage omitted] 
  [Daww-al-Na'im] The northern parties have warned the IGADD 
states that an agreement between just the government and the 
SPLM would not represent all the Sudanese people and would 
perhaps not be binding, and they renewed the call for a national 
constitutional conference embodying all Sudanese parties. What 
is your answer to that? 
  [Machar] My disagreement with the northern opposition is 
over the fact that they see a need for the downfall of the 
government first and then discussion of the problem. They do 
not take into consideration the suffering of the people of the 
south who have shouldered the burden and massive cost of the war 
including the famine, disease, and death. If we have to wait 
until the opposition assumes power, when would that be? They 
last time it took 16 years to topple (former President Ja'far) 
Numayri. [passage omitted] 
  The second observation is that the opposition grouping did 
rule Sudan at one point but the war continued. As regards their 
call for a constitutional conference, that is an old call. They 
did not implement it when they were in power, so why ask others 
to uphold it or wait for it? I do not trust them because when 
they are in the opposition they are friendly but when they are 
in power they resume the war and the policies which I fight. 
[passage omitted] 
  It should be clear that we do not wish to dominate power in 
the north. All we want is an independent state in the south 
because unity between the north and the south has failed and 
that is why secession is the solution. If we have to achieve 
that peacefully then let us do it through a referendum on 
self-determination. That does not necessarily mean that the two 
states would be enemies. We can look at the example set by 
Ethiopia and Eritrea. 
  [Daww-al-Na'im] Have you been invited to join the opposition 
Democratic National Grouping [DNG], and were Garang's relations 
with the DNG raised at your meeting? 
  [Machar] I did not discuss that matter with Garang but I 
believe that he is getting closer to my position without my 
discussing the matter with him. We are open to dealing with the 
DNG and I talked to their representatives in the past. We told 
them that they should not fear the idea of self-determination so 
long as it was going to be done peacefully. We tried to attend 
one of their meetings but they did not let us. I do not know 
what they are doing with Garang now because he now speaks the 
same language as we do, particularly since his call for 
self-determination. If, after this, he retains his membership 
of the DNG, why should we too not join? [passage omitted] 
  [Daww-al-Na'im] Two and a half years since the split, what 
have you achieved? 
  [Machar] We fulfilled the first objective which is to call 
for self-determination. It is now the main issue for the 
southerners. There is still some way to go to achieve democracy 
in the SPLM and guarantee human rights. Garang still has some 
prisoners. These were the three points over which we broke 
away. Yes, we agree on the aims of the movement but we may not 
agree on the way it is run or on the issue of safeguarding human 
rights. So we still have some way to go before the movement is 
reunited.
