FT  11 AUG 92 / Cost benefit claim
The government's proposed 'one-stop' service for benefit claimants may lead
to a cut in Civil Service jobs, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary,
said yesterday, David Owen writes.
Launching a discussion document outlining options for the system, Mr Lilley
said there 'may be' fewer Benefits Agency jobs as a result of the changes.
The agency, the largest executive agency within the Department of Social
Security, has about 70,000 staff.
The new system - part of a drive by the government to improve efficiency in
its biggest-spending department - will enable claimants to apply for a range
of benefits in the same place, eventually on a single form.
Mr Lilley said the new system would reduce errors, cut costs and crack down
on fraud.
Mr Archy Kirkwood, Liberal Democrat social-security spokesman, said the
shake-up did 'nothing at all to address the inadequacy and anomaly-ridden
social security legislation, which requires urgent and radical reform'.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said he hoped the changes
were moti vated by 'a genuine desire to improve the system for its users and
not just to cut costs'.
