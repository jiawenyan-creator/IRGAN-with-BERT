  [Excerpts] Moscow, 4 June -- Kim Yong-sam, president of the 
Republic of Korea, today left Moscow for Tashkent at the end of 
the Russian-Korean summit. 
  At Sheremetyevo-1 airport, the leader of the Republic of 
Korea was seen off by Oleg Soskovets, first deputy chairman of 
the Russian government. [passage omitted] 
  After visiting Uzbekistan on 4-6 June, Kim Yong-sam on 7 
June 
will visit Khabarovsk and Vladivostok, where he will meet the 
leadership of Khabarovsk Kray and Primorskiy Kray and will 
inspect a large anti-submarine ship of the Pacific Fleet. 
  "We are very pleased with the results of the Russian-South 
Korean summit," Han Sung-chu, the foreign minister of the 
Republic of Korea, stated to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "This 
was a major contribution towards the process of broadening and 
strengthening our relations in all spheres -- security, 
diplomacy, economy. In the economic sphere we have not just 
consolidated our existing economic links but opened new doors in 
our bilateral cooperation." 
  It is also very important that both presidents -- Boris 
Yeltsin and Kim Yong-sam -- got on well with each other 
personally, the minister noted. The two presidents have much in 
common: they are both very good politicians, have strong 
leadership qualities and are capable at taking decisive actions. 
  Georgiy Kunadze, the Russian ambassador in Seoul, said that 
the dialogue between the Russian and South Korean presidents was 
fruitful. Boris Yeltsin and Kim Yong-sam had a thorough 
exchange of opinions about relations between the two countries 
which are developing smoothly. Questions of international 
importance, including the North Korean nuclear issue were also 
discussed. The Russian side believes that this problem should 
be solved but at the same time no harsh steps need be taken, the 
ambassador noted.
