FT  17 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
London COCOA futures finished with gains of up to Pounds 19 a tonne in very
active conditions with the market making another attempt to break out of its
recent range. The jump was aided by sterling's weakness. Some traders
thought prices might rise further to meet producers' asking prices, now
possibly only about Pounds 10 above the market. Robusta COFFEE futures ended
near the lows reached early in the day after news of a rise in US stocks.
The September position closed at Dollars 916 a tonne, down Dollars 6. The
London GOLD price staged another early rise, encouraged by renewed buying in
New York, but ran into resistance at Dollars 371 a troy ounce. Gains were
trimmed by profit-taking before a late buying wave rallied the market to
Dollars 369.35 an ounce at the close, up Dollars 3.60 on the day. The London
Metal Exchange COPPER re-tested resistance above Dollars 1,850 a tonne for
three months metal as short-term sentiment was aided by a recent tightening
of forward premiums and caution ahead of end-June labour contract expiries
in the US and Chile. The price ended Dollars 11 up at Dollars 1,857 a tonne.
