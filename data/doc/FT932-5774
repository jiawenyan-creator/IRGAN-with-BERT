FT  02 JUN 93 / Sugar says his 48% stake in Tottenham is not for sale
MR ALAN SUGAR, the chairman of Tottenham Hotspur football club, yesterday
insisted he would not sell his 48 per cent stake in the club to Mr Terry
Venables, the Spurs chief executive he is trying to sack, or to anyone else.
Mr Sugar, intensifying the public relations battle running parallel to the
legal proceedings between the two men, also stated he would not be beaten
into submission by 'intimidating' tactics of the media and demonstrators. In
a letter to Tottenham staff, later released to the press, Mr Sugar said he
had no intention whatsoever of selling his shares.
'You can be sure that I will most strenuously object to any such suggestion
no matter how long or how far up the legal ladder it goes,' he said.
Mr Venables' camp claims it has three backers willing to help him buy out Mr
Sugar's 48 per cent stake and mount a full bid for the club.
In his letter Mr Sugar also accused the press of creating a 'Sugar/Venables
war'. He continued: 'It is rumoured that this is a strategy to wear me down
personally so that I will simply turn round and say 'What the hell am I
involved in all this aggravation for' and walk away.
'No matter how intimidating the press comments are about me or how
intimidating the demonstrations are, such as that outside the court the
other day, or how intimidating any such demonstrations outside my house may
be, I will not wane and give in to these types of tactics.'
The two men will make their next High Court appearance on Tuesday when Mr
Sugar attempts to have lifted the injunction which has so far prevented him
dismissing Mr Venables.
Tomorrow the two men are set to make their first joint public appearance
since last week's court hearing. They are due to join other football figures
at a press conference at Tottenham's ground to launch the Makita
International Soccer Tournament, a close season contest.
