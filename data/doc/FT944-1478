FT  20 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: US fiscal policy irresponsible
Sir, Your leading article, 'Evading US fiscal reality' (December 19), and
Michael Prowse's piece on the same page ('Why Bill signed Newt's contract')
correctly draw attention to the dangers of US tax cuts without commensurate
spending cuts and to the longer term problem of rising social security
spending. But even without these risks US fiscal policy looks irresponsible
because of the failure to use the current economic strength to reduce the
debit ratio.
Reaganomics took gross public debt from 38 per cent of gross domestic
product in 1980 to 53 per cent in 1989. The 1990 recession pushed it up
further to 64 per cent by end 1993. This year, with the benefit of GDP
growth at about 4 per cent, the ratio will fall, but only slightly. It will
not fall more because the structural budget deficit, that is after allowing
for economic cycle, has been allowed to continue at about 2.5 per cent of
GDP. When the US economy slows down over the next two years, as it must, the
ratio will inevitably start to rise again, even without any help from
unfunded tax cuts or the expected rise in social security spending.
