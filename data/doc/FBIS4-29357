  [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- A draft report on tax 
reforms worked out Thursday [16 June] by a tax panel of the 
ruling coalition called for phasing out tax privileges for small 
businesses, coalition officials said. 
  The report, to be presented to a meeting of coalition 
leaders 
early next week, did not propose a specific margin of raise for 
the consumption tax from the present 3 percent, leaving the 
decision up to the leaders. The coalition's tax reform package 
is expected to center on continued cuts in income and 
residential taxes after fiscal 1994 and a raise in the 
consumption tax. 
  Concerning a phaseout of tax privileges for small 
businesses, 
the report said the maximum annual sales of businesses that are 
allowed to keep the consumption tax they have collected from 
consumers should be cut to 20 million yen from the present 30 
million yen. It also called for abolition of the present system 
of allowing businesses with annual sales of less than 50 million 
yen to keep some of the consumption tax income. 
  In addition, the report said the maximum annual sales for 
businesses to which a simplified tax computation formula is 
applicable should be cut to either 300 million yen or 200 
million yen from the present 400 million yen. That decision is 
expected to be made by the tax panel in a meeting Friday.
