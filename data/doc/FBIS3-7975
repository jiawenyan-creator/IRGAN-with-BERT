<F P=106> [KONTINENT staff report: "Minister Reportedly About To </F>
Order Arrests To Quell Revolt in Army"] 
  [Text] The KONTINENT correspondent in Khaskovo reported 
that dozens of garrisons throughout the country are allegedly 
supporting the petition that the coordinators and chairman of 
clubs of the Rakovski Officers Legion have been organizing 
during the past few days. The main demand in the petition is 
that 37 billion leva should be allocated to defense, in line 
with the estimate submitted by the General Staff. The Legion's 
members also demand that the new defense act should contain 
provisions regulating servicemen's civil rights. 
  Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov reportedly reacted 
very 
strongly and ordered measures to be taken against a revolt in 
the army. The organizers of the petition escaped arrest by a 
hair's breadth, KONTINENT was informed by a source who preferred 
to remain anonymous. 
  Valentin Aleksandrov, Chief Military Prosecutor Lilko 
Yotsov, 
and Military Counterintelligence chief Colonel Stoyanov held a 
high-level meeting recently in Sofia to discuss the situation. 
On Saturday 26 February Chief of General Staff General Lyuben 
Petrov is reported to have summoned representatives of the 
Rakovski Legion. They reportedly assured him that they had no 
intention to raise a revolt and destabilize the army. The chief 
of General Staff also received assurances that the Legion would 
continue to observe the agreement signed with the defense 
minister that rules out the use of force to resolve disputed 
issues. 
  The initiators of the petition told KONTINENT correspondent 
Aleksandur Bozhkov that the petition will continue, and it will 
be handed in to parliament in a civilized manner. 
  President Zhelev and Prime Minister Berov were briefed by 
Defense Minister Aleksandrov on the situation among the troops.
