FT  20 NOV 92 / Building society savings rise
BUILDING societies managed to reverse the outflow of funds from the industry
last month, reflecting a national rise in savings.
The Building Societies Association said yesterday that the net inflow of
retail funds in October was Pounds 281m, compared with an outflow of Pounds
264m the previous month.
Figures published by the association showed a slight rise in new commitments
to mortgages and in actual mortgage lending. However, both figures remain at
low levels compared with the first half of the year.
Gross mortgage lending expanded to Pounds 1.9bn for the month, up from
Pounds 1.8bn in September. Net mortgage advances rose slightly to Pounds
683m, while net new commitments increased to Pounds 2.2bncompared with
Pounds 1.8bn in September.
Although the flow of funds into societies was aided by the lowering of rates
on National Savings products in the summer, National Savings products also
enjoyed a good month in October, achieving gross sales of Pounds 867m.
Building societies may benefit further this month from the withdrawal of two
National Savings products after the Autumn Statement. They were the
fixed-interest First Option Bond, and the fifth issue of index-linked
certificates.
Mr Mark Boleat, the association's director-general, said the savings inflow
'marked a welcome turnround from the September position but was still barely
half the level of a year earlier'. There was a net outflow of Pounds 262m
from societies in the third quarter of this year.
The attempt by societies to rebuild capital to offset growing provisions for
bad loans on mortgages has led to the raising of margins between mortgage
rates and the base rate over the past two months as base rates have fallen.
Mr Boleat said the 3-percentage-point reduction in base rates since late
September would help improve underlying sentiment towards the housing
market, and lending volumes would be likely to rise from next spring.
