FT  12 AUG 94 / Tension mounts in Chechnya
Tension mounted in the embattled Chechen republic yesterday, when Chechen
President Dzhokhar Dudayev ordered total mobilisation of the region's men to
prevent a possible invasion by Russia. Mr Dudayev's control over the
breakaway region, which appeared on the wane early this month when Moscow
stepped up its political and financial support of Chechen opposition forces,
has appeared to strengthen recently. Local reports claim the threat of an
invasion by Russia, which lost control of the area nearly three years ago,
has rallied the fiercely clannish Chechens to their leader. Mr Dudayev has
warned Russia that it would become entangled in 'a second Afghanistan' and
Moscow itself could fall victim to a 'jihad' launched by the Moslem
Chechens, who are renowned for their military prowess. These threats
appeared not to be lost on Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who yesterday
backed down from recent public sabre-rattling.
