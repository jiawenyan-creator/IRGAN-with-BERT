  [Text] Beijing May 27 ITAR-TASS -- The military technical 
ties between Russia and China are being developed 
"constructively across a relatively broad range" due to a 
longstanding tradition of interaction, Russian Deputy Defence 
minister Andrey Kokoshin said in an exclusive interview with 
ITAR-TASS in Beijing. 
  The arms systems China has were developed on the basis of 
Soviet samples and are "genetically" related. For this reason 
the Chinese market is attractive to Moscow, which "views the 
development of such ties positively," Kokoshin said. 
  As concerns specific projects, the Russian deputy defence 
minister pointed to a contract for the delivery to China of 
several combat aircraft of the Su-27 series. 
  "it is a very good machine. It can remain in service until 
the year 2020 or even 2025 if properly modernised, I mean its 
armament and onboard equipment," Andrey Kokoshin explained. He 
stressed that "our Chinese friends made the right choice."
