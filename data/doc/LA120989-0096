DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN SLAIN IN HOUSE, POSSIBLY BY BURGLAR 
A 50-year-old Sepulveda woman was found stabbed to death in her house, which 
had apparently been ransacked by her assailant, Los Angeles police said Friday. 
Nancy Gail Bronston was found dead about 5:30 p.m. Thursday when police 
investigated a call from a neighbor that something was wrong at her house in 
the 8500 block of Decelis Place, police said. The victim apparently had been 
stabbed a few hours earlier when she returned to the house, possibly surprising 
a burglar, police said. 
There were no arrests or suspects. Police said Bronston's 1981 Cadillac was 
found abandoned Friday afternoon in the parking lot at the Van Nuys Swap Meet 
in Sepulveda. It was unknown exactly what other property was taken from 
Bronston's house.
