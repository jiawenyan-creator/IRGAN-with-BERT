FT  02 MAR 94 / N Ireland wins Pounds 36m plastics factory
Three hundred jobs are to be created in Northern Ireland with the decision
by Benelux, a Hong Kong-based company, to build a Pounds 36.6m plastics
container factory at Limavady, County Londonderry.
The decision to site the plant in an area of the province which has already
attracted significant foreign investment was announced yesterday by Mr Tim
Smith, Northern Ireland economy minister.
Mr Smith said the factory should be in production by August. The factory is
planned for an 18-acre site, and will produce 20m compact disc containers
each month to be sold in Europe and the US.
Mr John McGuckian, chairman of Northern Ireland's Industrial Development
Board, said the investment represented another success in Ulster's efforts
to attract to the province Asian Pacific companies deciding to start
operations in Europe.
In the past 14 months two Korean companies - Carmen and Daesung - have
announced they are to invest in the province.
Carmen makes car stereos and Daesung manufactures printed circuit boards. In
addition Texmaco, an Indonesian-based man-made fabrics specialist, has also
announced it is to set up a plant.
The Benelux factory will be the first in Europe for the company, which makes
micro-cassettes, floppy disks and containers for audio and video cassettes.
Benelux employs 4,000 people in Hong Kong, China and Indonesia and sells its
products to customers such as Sony, Olympus and Philips.
Mr Gary Chow, Benelux chairman, said yesterday that the company had looked
at other European sites and had chosen Ulster primarily because of the
availability of 'easily trained people' and the presence of 24-hour
continuous working practices.
Financial incentives, he added, had also been an important factor. The
province offered 'an excellent bridgehead' for European and US markets.
