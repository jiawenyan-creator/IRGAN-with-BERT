SOUTHWEST ROUNDUP; 
TCU SCORES QUICKLY, BEATS ARKANSAS, 54-26 
Texas Christian struck quickly and effectively against two-time defending 
Southwest Conference champion Arkansas Saturday night at Little Rock, Ark. 
Leon Clay completed six of his first seven passes for 214 yards and three 
touchdowns as TCU coasted past the No. 21 Razorbacks, 54-26, the most points 
ever scored by the Horned Frogs in a conference game. 
The victory was TCU's first over Arkansas since 1984 and only the third in the 
last 32 years. 
Texas Christian is 4-1 overall -- its best start since 1984 -- and 2-0 in the 
Southwest Conference for the first time since 1958. 
Arkansas is 2-2 and 0-1. 
Clay completed 19 of 28 passes for 322 yards. He had touchdown pass plays of 88 
yards to Kyle McPherson and 57 yards to Richard Woodley in the first 93 seconds 
of the second quarter as TCU built a 28-10 lead with just 13 offensive plays. 
No. 13 Houston 31, Baylor 15 -- Dave Klingler threw 68 passes, completing 35 
for 405 yards, as the Cougars (4-0, 3-0) beat the Bears (2-3, 1-1) in an SWC 
game at Waco, Tex. 
Klingler's 68 attempts is one short of the school and conference record set by 
former Houston quarterback Andre Ware. 
The 35 completions was the most ever against a Baylor team. And it was 
Klingler's fourth consecutive game over 400 yards. 
Two of Klingler's passes went to Patrick Cooper for touchdowns as the nation's 
No. 2 offensive team piled up 467 yards against Baylor's prevent defense. 
Klingler completed 21 of 41 passes for 269 yards in the first half as the 
Cougars built a 13-0 lead. 
No. 19 Texas A&amp;M 28, Texas Tech 24 -- Backup quarterback Bucky Richardson 
scored the winning touchdown from a yard out after directing a long 
fourth-quarter drive and Darren Lewis rushed for a career-high 232 yards in 34 
carries as the 19th-ranked Aggies (4-1, 1-0) beat the Red Raiders (1-4, 0-2) in 
an SWC game at College Station. 
Lewis' 232 rushing yards was the most yards ever given up by Tech to an SWC 
runner. On the SWC all-time list, Lewis is now tied for second with former Tech 
running back James Gray for number of games with over 200 yards rushing (four) 
and former Texas running back Earl Campbell for number of 100-yard games (21). 
Richardson came in after starting quarterback Lance Pavlas had an interception 
returned 67 yards early in the game. 
Rodney Blackshear of Texas Tech returned a kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown. It 
was the first kickoff return for a touchdown against Texas A&amp;M's 12th Man 
-- a group of non-scholarship students -- since its inception in 1983. 
Texas 26, Rice 10 -- Michael Pollak, the nation's leading kicker, had field 
goals of 41, 37 and 27 yards in the first half and a 31-yarder in the fourth 
quarter at Houston as the Longhorns (2-1, 1-0) beat the Owls (2-3, 0-2) for the 
25th consecutive year. 
Texas' domination of the Owls is the longest streak in the SWC. 
Pollak, a fifth-year senior who had never attempted a college field goal until 
this season, has kicked three in each of Texas' games this season. 
Adrian Walker had a one-yard touchdown run and Patrick Wilson scored on a 
four-yard run for the Longhorns. 
North Texas 14, SMU 7 -- Quarterback Scott Davis rushed for 203 yards and two 
touchdowns to lead the Eagles (3-2) over the Mustangs (1-3) in a nonconference 
game at Denton, Tex. 
Davis scored the game-winning touchdown on a four-yard run with 1:24 left in 
the third quarter.
