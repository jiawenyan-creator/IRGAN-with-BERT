'FANTASIA' AND CHANGE 
This is in response to an Oct. 28 letter in which Dr. C. Fortenberry complains 
of an evening being ruined because three seconds of "Fantasia" were seen as 
racist. 
Good God, first the old Dick Tracy cartoon, now this! Why are we comparing the 
morals and values of old movies and television to current standards? 
Should Jackie Gleason's "The Honeymooners" be censored because Ralph's sexist 
attitude is not popular now? Is "Singin' in the Rain" offensive because it's 
not drought-conscious? 
If "Fantasia" were to be made today, I'm sure a racially offensive scene would 
not even be considered. But 50 years ago even Walt Disney didn't have the 
foresight to know that showing dark-skinned characters serving light-skinned 
characters would be considered offensive. 
Fortunately, society has matured to a point that such portrayals are no longer 
appropriate. Let's celebrate that fact instead of letting something that 
happened long ago ruin an evening.
