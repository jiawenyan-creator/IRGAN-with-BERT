TOP POLLUTERS 
The South Coast Air Quality Management District this week released its annual 
list of companies emitting the largest volume of two pollutants -- reactive 
hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen. This list covers emissions during 1988. 
REACTIVE HYDROCARBONS 
These are produced by incomplete combustion of gasoline, and from fumes from 
fuels, paints, and industrial and dry-cleaning solvents. They are a prime 
ingredient in formation of ozone, the invisible, lung-irritating gas that is 
smog's main component.

OXIDES OF NITROGEN

and industrial boilers. They combine with hydrocarbons to form ozone, the most 
intractable pollutant in the Los Angeles basin.
