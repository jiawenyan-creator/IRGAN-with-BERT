WORLD; 
AUSTRALIAN SEES GROWTH PROBLEMS 
Australia may have to curb immigration and set a population ceiling of around 
25 million some time in the future, Immigration Minister Robert Ray said today. 
Ray, in a television interview, said one in seven Australians will be of Asian 
origin in 40 years. Australia's present population is around 17 million, with 
the bulk of migrants from Britain, Ireland and New Zealand. 
About 70% of migrants settle in Sydney and Melbourne, he said. 
"At some stage in the future, for environmental or other reasons, it may be in 
our self-interest then to limit migration," he said. 
More than 120,000 immigrants are admitted to Australia every year.
