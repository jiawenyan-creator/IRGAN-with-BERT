RULING LIKELY TO DETOUR LUCKY, ALPHA BETA MERGER 
American Stores' plans to put together a huge California supermarket chain 
appeared to unwind Monday after the company suffered a major setback in U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
Industry analysts said American, parent of Lucky and Alpha Beta stores, is now 
under pressure to seek an agreement that would settle the challenge by 
California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp to the proposed combination of the 
two supermarket divisions. Neither the Attorney General's Office nor American 
would discuss the likelihood of a settlement. 
Any out-of-court agreement probably would require American to sell some of its 
Lucky or Alpha Beta stores and accept curbs on its ability to buy other 
supermarkets in California. If efforts to settle fail, some analysts said, 
American might try to sell its entire Alpha Beta division, which has lost 
ground to competitors. 
American's plans to combine Alpha Beta and Lucky, which it bought for $2.5 
billion in June, 1988, were jolted by a Supreme Court decision allowing state 
authorities and others to contest mergers under federal antitrust law. 
American had argued that the authority for weighing mergers under U.S. law 
rested with such federal regulators as the Federal Trade Commission, which 
approved the proposed Alpha Beta-Lucky combination before Van de Kamp launched 
his challenge. American has operated Lucky -- already the state's largest chain 
-- and Alpha Beta largely as separate organizations while it waged its legal 
battle. 
Under Monday's ruling, American can still argue for allowing the merger on the 
grounds that the combination would not significantly reduce supermarket 
competition in Southern California. Industry observers, however, said the Salt 
Lake City-based company appears to be losing its will to continue its court 
battle. 
"Management at this point appears to be frustrated and flustered," said John 
Kosecoff, an analyst with the First Manhattan investment firm. 
Christopher O. B. Wright, an antitrust specialist with the law firm Latham 
&amp; Watkins in Los Angeles, predicted that American would settle its case 
rather than risk losing its court fight and being forced to sell its Lucky 
stores. He said that under the Supreme Court ruling, a lower court judge could 
order such a divestiture. 
"I'd expect that American Stores will go to the bargaining table pretty 
quickly," Wright said. 
Observers also speculated that Van de Kamp is increasingly interested in a 
settlement. They said that Van de Kamp, a Democrat campaigning for governor who 
faces a primary vote in June, would like to resolve the dispute and devote his 
attention other issues. 
"He already has the big victory here," Wright said. 
Michael J. Strumwasser, a special assistant attorney general working on the 
case, said his office has been interested in an out-of-court agreement all 
along. Monday's ruling, he added, "certainly makes it easier to settle the 
case." But he declined to elaborate. 
American and Van de Kamp already have reached settlements that have allowed two 
small parts of the proposed Lucky-Alpha Beta merger to go ahead. In November, 
American won the right to merge its stores in Northern California, where the 
company is less of a competitive force. Under the deal, American agreed to sell 
13 of its 36 Alpha Beta stores in Northern California and put the remaining 23 
stores under Lucky management and give them the Lucky name. American's merger 
plan has called for all of its current Alpha Beta stores to be operated under 
the Lucky name. 
Then, in January, Van de Kamp's office and American reached an agreement 
allowing the two chains' warehouses in Southern California to blend some 
operations. 
Together, Lucky and Alpha Beta would be the leading supermarket chain in 
Southern California. According to recent market research, 29% of the households 
in Los Angeles and Orange counties buy most of their groceries at Lucky or 
Alpha Beta stores. In second place is Vons supermarkets, including the 
company's Pavilions stores, with a market share of 24%. 
For consumers, Monday's ruling may eventually provide some good news. Analysts 
and company officials have argued that the cost of running both Lucky and Alpha 
Beta has driven up American's expenses, and those expenses have been passed 
along to consumers in the form of higher prices. Any settlement, consequently, 
could help bring down those costs. 
For its part, Van de Kamp's office has argued that a full merger of Alpha Beta 
and Lucky, by cutting competition, would push up prices and cost California 
consumers more than $200 million a year. Taken in that light, a settlement 
could be crafted to eliminate those price increases. 
Lucky has 185 stores in the six-county Southern California region consisting of 
Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties. 
Throughout California, it has 373 stores, making it the state's No. 1 chain. 
Alpha Beta has 175 stores in Southern California, the only part of the state 
where it continues to do business. It ranks among the state's five largest 
chains. 
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, American's shares fell $1.75, 
closing at $63.75.
