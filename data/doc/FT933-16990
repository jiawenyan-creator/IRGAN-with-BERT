FT  01 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government avoids EC seat defeat
THE GOVERNMENT last night warded off defeat on the bill redrawing
constituencies for next June's elections to the European Parliament.
It agreed to public inquiries on proposed new boundaries if this proved
feasible, a concession which helped to persuade Labour not to oppose the
measure, clearing the way for its second Commons reading by 290 votes to 51,
a government majority of 239.
A Labour amendment criticising the government's failure to use the Boundary
Commissions or to provide an extra seat for Scotland was defeated by 300
votes to 254 - a government majority of 46.
In the preceding debate, government ministers replied in emollient tones to
opposition MPs and Tory Euro-sceptics who criticised its plans authorising
the creation of six new Euro-constituencies to raise the number of MEPs
representing the UK from 81 to 87.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said he would have preferred to appoint
the Boundary Commission in the normal way and to have public inquiries - but
there was no time.
He explained that two special European parliamentary constituency committees
would fulfil the role normally played by the boundary commissions, and hoped
they would include some of the members of the commissions.
Mr Howard looked to the committees to complete their work on boundaries for
five new Euro-constituencies in England and one in Wales by the end of
November.
His theme was later developed by Mr Peter Lloyd, the home office minister,
who said it was the government's 'objective' to set up the Commissions in
all but name - 'so far as is possible in the time'. Opposition parties would
be consulted on the make-up of the committees, he added.
The Maastricht bill last night cleared its committee stage discussion in the
Lords. The government had a majority of 129 to 63 as peers rejected an
opposition amendment in favour of the UK's adoption of the social chapter.
