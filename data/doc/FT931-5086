FT  08 MAR 93 / Observer: Nipped in the bud
What's blighting Britain's budding bankers? Passes in the customer services
section of their chartered institute's exams last May came out at a
miserable 22 per cent of entrants, despite instructions to markers to look
more for good than bad points.
Gobbledegooked answers is the main culprit, suggests the relevant chief
examiner Richard Hands, who evidently sees the said lack of clarity as more
than an academic problem. 'Many complaints concerning bank services stem
from a failure to provide an adequate explanation to the customer,' he
writes in the institute's journal.
But lack of empathy is also at fault, to judge by his hints for future
candidates. It is scarcely fitting for bank staff to try to interest newly
jobless customers in long-term investments such as pensions, for instance,
or to advise them to put part of their redundancy money towards repaying 'an
existing affordable mortgage'.
Particularly not a bank mortgage, one assumes.
Oh . . . and candidates should not be misled by textbook references to the
average margin on personal lending being between 3 and 6 per cent. 'Such
generalisations no longer work,' says Hands. 'Personal loans currently carry
APRs in the order of 20 per cent against a base rate of, say, 7 per cent.
Unauthorised borrowing can be charged at 30 per cent or more]'
The exclamation mark, by the way, is his.
