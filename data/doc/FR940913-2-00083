 

Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for a Default Judgment and Entry of Sanctions


Date: August 18, 1994.


Case No. 94OFC14


In the Matter of: United States Department of Labor, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Plaintiff v.
KRT Drywall/Acoustical, Defendant.




It appears that:
1. Plaintiff U.S. Department of Labor filed the complaint herein on July 13, 1994 pursuant to the expedited hearing
procedures set forth in 41 CFR 6030.31 

et seq.

 A copy of the complaint is attached hereto and is incorporated herein by this reference.
2. The complaint and Plaintiff's Request for Admissions were served on Defendant KRT Drywall/Acoustical by Federal
Express and were received by KRT on July 13, 1994.
3. KRT did not file an answer, nor has it requested an extension of time within which to file an answer.
4. On August 9, 1994 Plaintiff filed a ``Motion for Default Judgment and Entry of Sanctions'' on the grounds that Defendant
failed to file an answer or request an extension of time within 20 days after service of the complaint as required by
41 CFR 6030.6(a).
5. On August 10, 1994 Defendant filed an ``Objection to Plaintiff's Motion For a Default Judgment and Entry of Sanctions''
requesting a denial of the Plaintiff's default motion on the grounds that the complaint ``may have been misplaced,''
and that therefore entry of default ``will work an injustice upon KRT.''
6. On August 15, 1994 Plaintiff filed its response to Defendant's objection contending that the provisions of 41 CFR
60.32(c) are mandatory.
41 CFR 60.30.32(c) provides that if a hearing is not requested within 25 days of the filing of the complaint, the allegations
of the complaint shall be adopted as findings, and the sanctions and/or penalties sought in the complaint shall be
imposed. It appears that the above provisions of 41 CFR 60.30.32(c) are mandatory and not discretionary.
Since Defendant has neither filed an answer nor asked for an extension of time within which to answer, and has to date
not requested a hearing in any other way, Plaintiff's Motion for Default is granted and Plaintiff's Proposed Findings
of Fact and Conclusions of Law, which are attached and incorporated herein by this reference, are adopted as the findings
herein.
It is therefore ordered that all of KRT's Federal contracts and subcontracts are immediately canceled; and that KRT
or Construction Associates, its officers, agents, subsidiaries, and successors (including Construction Associates),
are declared ineligible to receive any Government contracts or subcontracts or for extensions or other modifications
of any existing Government contracts or subcontracts, for a period of at least 210 days, and thereafter until KRT has
demonstrated to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance Programs that it is currently in
compliance with the provisions of the Executive Orders No. 11246, 11375 and 12086 and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, and that it has undertaken to correct past acts of noncompliance, including identifying and making whole
any victims of its past noncompliance, and that it will carry out employment practices in compliance with the Executive
Orders No. 11246, 11375 and 12086.
