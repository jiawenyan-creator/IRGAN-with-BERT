<F P=106> [Interview with General Jean Berhin, Army chief of staff, by </F>
Olivier Alsteens; place and date not given: "Army: Social 
Factors Must Be Given Priority"--first paragraph is LE SOIR 
introduction] 
  [Text] General Jean Berhin is the Army chief of staff. For 
two years he has been carrying out the government's decision to 
professionalize the Army. Is this a makeshift reform? 
  [Berhin] Professionalization is much more than eliminating 
military service, which was the initial objective of the 
political decision. 
  [Alsteens] The troops based across the Rhine will be brought 
home around mid-1994. This affects 4,000 families. The 
regrouping of units will also lead to more than 10,000 transfers 
this year. How can a "big upheaval" like that be managed? 
  [Berhin] By giving priority to social issues: First, no 
redundancies; second, one year's notification of the next 
posting; and third, taking into consideration the soldiers' 
choices. Everyone has to select three postings accompanied by a 
justification. So far 60 percent of soldiers have been given 
their first choice. We have deliberately given priority to 
social factors...at the expense of operational factors. This is 
a risk which we have taken. We must now rebuild units to obtain 
a degree of cohesion by 1997. The coming years will be very 
difficult. The professional army will not be established 
overnight. 
  [Alsteens] You are currently touring the units to meet your 
men. What are their main anxieties? 
  [Berhin] Our social effort is being recognized. The 
essential questions relate to the army's future. I cannot give 
them a satisfactory answer on that. 
  [Alsteens] Personal problems are being raised. For instance 
for Belgian-German couples. 
  [Berhin] It is true that some households are facing 
extremely 
painful choices: To stay in Germany and leave the army or to 
come back to Belgium. Strong households overcome these 
problems. For the others, it is sometimes the last straw. 
Soldiers' wives are often less mobile than their husbands. The 
problem is even greater when it comes to German wives. 
(silence... -- LE SOIR editor's note) When you tour the 
garrisons, it is not easy to come face-to-face with a man who 
blames you for this problem. You do not know what to say. 
  [Alsteens] One of the problems of repatriation is housing. 
It has not yet been solved. 
  [Berhin] For two years we have been drawing the minister's 
attention to this problem, without results, however. Except 
that he has announced his intention of building 250 family homes 
by the end of the year. I doubt that this deadline will be met. 
And then, this has come rather late... However, I hope that 
this initial step will be followed by others. 
  [Alsteens] Some soldiers are complaining that those being 
repatriated will have priority in the granting of these homes... 
  [Berhin] The German criterion is not the only one. But we 
must now draw a distinction between those who have a house and 
those who do not. This means that the military housing of those 
without priority will have to be released. I know that 
pensioners will also be affected. Social inquiries will have to 
be made. Not all pensioners are corporals... 
  [Alsteens] The professional army's main problem will be 
recruitment, especially of short-term soldiers. 
  [Berhin] This is the crux of the whole reform. We need an 
army of trained, motivated, and, above all, available 
volunteers. The legal framework does not yet exist. That is 
hampering us considerably. Recruitment is running parallel to 
the release of surplus staff. This is vital to secure financial 
resources for rehiring. Young men are needed for fighting 
roles. At the level of the troops, the ideal is to have a 
structure which is 65 percent "short-term" and 35 percent 
"career" soldiers. 
  [Alsteens] This is likely to present a problem of surplus 
numbers at the level of the troops too. 
  [Berhin] The minister denies this problem. But we will have 
to find room for the "short-term" soldiers in the troops. In 
the army, we have 300 officers and 1,600 junior officers too 
many. The number of surplus soldiers has not yet been assessed. 
  [Alsteens] What will your short-term requirements be in 
normal times? 
  [Berhin] We will hire 1,250 "short-term" soldiers each year 
compared with 725 career soldiers. 
  [Alsteens] So the surplus number of "career" soldiers by 
1997 
could be almost 5,000? 
  [Berhin] I would not say that. That would mean revolution. 
  [Alsteens] Where is there currently a shortage of 
candidates? 
  [Berhin] In fighting roles we have a constant shortage. We 
are now dreaming of units constituted as such that can be formed 
overnight. The deficit is even more glaring in the 
Dutch-speaking units. If we keep all the volunteers, at the 
expense of the age pyramid and principles of efficiency, we will 
obtain a nearly complete French-speaking contingent, but a 
Flemish contingent which is only 80 percent complete. The 
problem is that we are soon likely to have an army which 
respects the 60/40 [language] ratio in its officers but whose 
troops are mainly French-speaking. Our first recruitment 
campaign will be mainly directed toward the north. 
  [Alsteens] What are you suggesting to ensure the required 
departures? 
  [Berhin] The minister has proposed that people leave for the 
communes and regions.... That does not seem to be meeting with 
great success. The general staff has produced a new plan. 
Soldiers with less than five years before retirement could be 
given their full pension and, in the period of time between now 
and the official pension date, would receive payment at least 
equal to that pension. But that would not be enough, even by 
increasing internal mobility, for instance by placing soldiers 
in civilian jobs in the Army. We also want measures to release 
younger soldiers. For that we need significant bonuses. The 
minister is not showing any openness... Ultimately, that will 
make it impossible to send Belgian units abroad. Our units will 
no longer be credible. 
  [Alsteens] You need outstanding officers to reorganize or 
even rebuild these units.... 
  [Berhin] We need "nothing but" outstanding officers.... 
  [Alsteens] You also need an appropriate budget.... 
  [Berhin] The budget is fixed at 97 billion [currency not 
given] until 1997. We will then need a budget which makes it 
possible to implement the structures chosen by politics. But 97 
billion is not enough. We have been saying that since the start 
of the reform. And we have still not received any reply. We 
are, therefore, postponing vital investments. Our country is 
already lagging behind. We need a reasonable effort to remain 
credible. It is time the statements were acted on. Without 
that, Belgium's military will no longer have a say in the 
European and international military institutions. Without this 
reasonable budget effort, we will soon only have an army on 
paper. 
<H5>  A Tool in Claes' Hands </H5>
  [Alsteens] The professionalization of the Army is being 
carried out at the same time as an unparalleled commitment of 
Belgian soldiers throughout the world. Is this a contradiction? 
  [Berhin] We have become a tool of Belgian foreign policy. At 
present it is Willy Claes who has matters in hand. It is he who 
is requesting the interventions because Belgium wishes to play 
an active role within the United Nations. It is the military 
which has reservations about new interventions. 
  [Alsteens] Is Willy Claes the boss of national defense? What 
is Minister Delcroix doing? 
  [Berhin] The national defense minister is there to define 
and 
pass on the limit of our resources within the government. 
  [Alsteens] Is the Army really supplying the maximum blue 
helmet contingent? 
  [Berhin] Yes, this limit has been reached. In 1993, we had 
2,000 men permanently on missions. The end of the mission to 
Somalia corresponded with the start of the mission in Rwanda. 
The contingent in Africa has been halved to 450 men. We still 
have around 1,000 in the former Yugoslavia: In Baranja, and 
also engineering and transport troops in Bosnia. Last week, an 
armored infantry unit moved from Baranja to Bosnia, to much more 
exposed terrain. We must take care; These interventions are far 
from being routine. The danger exists, we must take account of 
it. So far, blue helmets still seem to be respected. They are 
not being used systematically as targets. That is reassuring. 
  [Alsteens] Proportionally, Belgium, together with France, is 
the biggest supplier of blue helmets. Why are Belgian soldiers 
popular? 
  [Berhin] Their efficiency, their training, their 
responsibility are recognized. Moreover, Belgium only sends 
career volunteers. These men are mature. This is an important 
factor. Finally, compared with other countries, the Belgians 
are operational as soon as they arrive on the scene. They take 
everything with them. Other countries send troops without 
equipment. 
  [Alsteens] Does the dispatch of Belgian troops on such a 
scale present some human problems? 
  [Berhin] Absence sometimes has major consequences for 
families. For some, who are already experiencing problems, it is 
the last straw. We hear about that later from chaplains or 
psychological services. The first missions lasted six months 
with 10 days leave in the middle. We have now reduced them to 
four months. That is preferable. 
  [Alsteens] However, the families are "supported...." 
  [Berhin] That is done at the level of the units. The 
families are kept informed during operations. They see each 
other, can send video messages... It is important to show that 
the Army is also concerned with the families. We have also 
noted the importance which they attach to links with the family 
member who is on the mission. This is essential for the morale 
of all. However, the mail never travels fast enough for them.
