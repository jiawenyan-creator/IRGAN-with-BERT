FT  19 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: TV stocks firm
Television stocks perked up on the implications of the sale by WH Smith of
its 14 per cent stake in Yorkshire Tele-vision.
Smith sold its 7m shares at 200p apiece to LWT Holdings, which subsequently
announced that it was taking over Yorkshire's crumbling advertising sales
section. The stake sale had been anticipated for some time and had prompted
a certain amount of bid speculation.
The appearance of LWT removes the potential bid value but replaces it with a
more comforting shareholder fit and a much-needed advertising boost,
analysts said. The shares rose 13 on the news before closing a net 6 ahead
at 178p.
The focus on advertising also encompassed Anglia TV, 7 up at 286p, and
Scottish TV, 6 better at 569p. WH Smith 'A' slipped 2 to 438p.
Switching from Lloyds Bank into Barclays saw the latter advance 7 to 446p on
hefty turnover of 4.9m shares and the former slip 3 to 542p on 4.1m traded.
First-quarter figures from Sedgwick, the insurance broker, were Pounds 1.5m
below most expectations. Sedgwick shares receded 3 to 167p on above-average
turnover of 3.2m.
Fisons shed 7 to 165p as the sale of its North American horticulture
business for Dollars 60m failed to reassure.
Gases and healthcare group BOC fell 17 to 681p as the company reported
improved first-half profits but said that the outlook was sluggish.
GEC was among the market's most heavily traded stocks, closing 2 harder at
319p, with at least two leading broking houses said to be keenly supporting
the shares.
Linx Printing Technologies lost 36 at 139p, after 121p, following a profits
warning.
The market appreciated the terms of the well signposted rights issue from
British Airways. The Pounds 442m cash call was announced with year-end
results of Pounds 185m, at the bottom end of market expectations. However,
analysts were encouraged by the fact that one-off items had played a
significant part in the profits decline and future prospects looked good.
The shares finished just a halfpenny softer at 296 1/2 p after trade of
3.3m.
Securiguard, the business services group, jumped 104 to 289p after
environmental services company Rentokil surprised the market by launching a
hostile Pounds 59.2m bid to help its move into security services in the UK
and US.
The company urged investors not to accept the 270p a share offer and
analysts predicted a long battle. The shares are tightly held and turnover
was thin. Rentokil relinquished 4 to 193p.
Fears of stiffer US competition for TI Group prompted the shares to dip 4 to
326p. The fears surround TI's landing gear manufacturing business following
the takeover of a US rival.
The 95 per cent drop in interim profits at Fenner left the shares 6 lighter
at 77p.
Results from Allied-Lyons came in line with market forecasts and the shares
marked time at 543p.
Leading textiles groups were boosted by the Marks and Spencer figures, which
hinted at improved volumes. SG Warburg's textiles analyst said there were
relative merits for the suppliers. Coats Viyella put on 3 at 237p ahead of a
presentation by Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken on Friday. Courtaulds Textiles rose 10
to 544p.
