FT  19 OCT 94 / People: Fresh finance function at Argyll group
Supermarket group Argyll, owner of the Safeway chain, has held back from
appointing a group finance director to replace Colin Smith, promoted to
group chief executive earlier this year, but is appointing a chief financial
officer.
He is Simon Laffin, 35, previously group financial controller, who has been
taking joint responsibility for financial affairs with Colin Smith since the
latter's elevation.
'Although Simon has not taken on the job title of group finance director, he
has effectively assumed most of the duties formerly undertaken by Colin
Smith,' says Argyll.
Laffin is also taking over as finance director of Safeway Stores - now the
dominant part of the group, since the recent sale of Argyll's Lo-Cost
discount chain - in place of Nairn Glen, who moves to become director of
financial control of Safeway. Argyll is currently carrying out a strategic
review of all its businesses, which may result in some further changes in
management responsibilities.
Analysts believe Laffin is being groomed for the title of group FD and a
seat on the board in due course.
He joined Argyll as financial controller in 1990, after holding senior
financial positions with Mars. He is an associate of the Institute of
Chartered Management Accountants.
