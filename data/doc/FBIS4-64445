  [Text] Bern, 2 May (ATS) -- Switzerland welcomes the smooth 
development of the voting process in South Africa. "This 
historical poll testifies to the courage and the determination 
of the South African political forces which have been able to 
overcome their divisions to make a decisive step for the future 
of their country," said the Federal Department of Foreign 
Affairs (DFAE). 
  In the future, Switzerland wants to make its cooperation 
with 
South Africa an essential priority, adds the DFAE in a 
communique. After sending 100 observers to monitor the first 
multiracial elections, the Confederation intends to deepen its 
relations with South Africa. Special attention will be paid to 
strengthening social peace and the rule-of-law state.
