  [Text] Cairo, 10 Mar (MENA)-- Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has revealed a serious, sizable terrorist scheme that 
was ready for implementation during 'Id al-Adha [holiday]. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM to be published tomorrow, 
Friday, the interior minister disclosed that the security 
agencies managed to frustrate the scheme beforehand, after 
seizing faxed instructions from abroad found in the possession 
of the 25 terrorists arrested last Sunday. 
  Al-Alfi added that the dreadful scheme sought to terrify the 
public by carrying out a number of terrorist operations such as 
blowing up a considerable number of recreation grounds, cinemas, 
and theaters and assassinating a number of public figures. 
  In the interview, al-Alfi reveals that large amounts of 
money, estimated at thousands of dollars, were found in the 
possession of the members of this new terrorist organization, 
which belongs to the "Islamic Group," who were involved in 
recent attempts to blow up banks. The money was being used to 
finance their operations. 
  Al-Alfi added that large amounts of material used in making 
high- explosive charges were discovered in hideouts in Asyut and 
Cairo. Sent from abroad, the material contained new substances 
that were to be used for the first time and were to be set off 
by remote control to cause the largest possible explosions.
