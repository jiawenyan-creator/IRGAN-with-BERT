FT  12 FEB 92 / Ireland to get US computer facility
CABLETRON Systems, a US-based manufacturer of computer networking hardware,
is to establish a European manufacturing base in Ireland this year,
following a rapid growth in sales over the past three years, writes Tim
Coone from Dublin.
The IPounds 12m (Pounds 11.17m) manufacturing facility will be located at
the Plassey Technological Park in Limerick, a focal point for electronic
industry development in the west of Ireland.
The project is being part-funded by Ireland's Industrial Development
Authority (IDA), and will also be able to take advantage of Ireland's low
corporate tax rate of 10 per cent.
The company, founded in 1983, manufactures 'intelligent hubs', which enable
computers of diverse design and architecture to link together into local
area networks.
Its projected world sales for 1992 are Dollars 290m (Pounds 160.2m), 25 per
cent of which will be for the European market.
There are now about 250 electronics companies located in Ireland, employing
26,000 people.
Exports of electronic equipment and parts now comprise approximately 20 per
cent of Ireland's total exports.
