FT  15 APR 91 / TVS fails to find buyer for MTM
TVS Entertainment has withdrawn MTM from the market because it could not
obtain a satisfactory offer for the US independent production company.
The ITV company for the south of England bought the US group in July 1988
for Dollars 320m (Pounds 180.7m) in advance of a sharp decline in the
American programme syndication market.
The company has been attempting to sell MTM to Spelling Productions of the
US for about Dollars 70m but has been unable to obtain a 'clean contract'
without conditions.
TVS will now have to include MTM when it constructs its business plan and
bids for a new 10-year franchise licence from the beginning of 1993.
The deadline for bids in the competitive tenders for franchises is May 15
and TVS is expected to face opposition from MAI, the advertising and
financial service group, and from a David Frost/Virgin consortium.
TVS will continue to finance Evening Shade and Rosie O'Neill, if they are
renewed by the US networks and probably the remake of WKRP.
All other new shows will be financed one at a time.
TVS is still undecided at the highest level whether or not a new shareholder
is needed to add extra financial underpinning to the bid for a new licence.
There is a view that, with strong shareholders such as Canal Plus, the
successful French subscription television company, further support is
unnecessary.
