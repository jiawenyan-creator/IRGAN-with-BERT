Background 


On December 30, 1993, a petition was filed with the Commission and the Department of Commerce by Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc
Specialty Chemicals Co., Cranbury, NJ, alleging that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened
with material injury by reason of LTFV imports of coumarin from the People's Republic of China. Accordingly, effective
December 30, 1993, the Commission instituted antidumping investigation No. 731TA677 (Preliminary).

Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigation and of a public conference to be held in connection therewith
was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington,
DC, and by publishing the notice in the 

Federal Register

 of January 7, 1994 (59 F.R. 1026). The conference was held in Washington, DC, on January 20, 1994, and all persons who
requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. 
The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on February 14,
1994. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2733 (February 1994), entitled ``Coumarin from
the People's Republic of China: Investigation No. 731TA677 (Preliminary).'' 




By order of the Commission.
