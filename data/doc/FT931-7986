FT  22 FEB 93 / MPs to examine PO privatisation
THE COMMONS trade and industry committee is to use an unexpected gap in next
month's schedule to interview senior Post Office executives.
Questions from the cross-party body are expected to concentrate on the Post
Office's possible privatisation and on the findings of an EC green paper on
European postal services. The intention is to raise any points it is thought
necessary to follow up with ministers at a later date.
The move comes amid mounting speculation concerning the government's plans
for the future ownership of the Post Office. Privatisation of it as a single
unit is thought to be increasingly favoured in Whitehall. The government is
so far committed only to selling the parcels division.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, has added
his voice to the debate, saying the best solution would be an 'autonomous'
Post Office corporation based on the French model, with taxpayers as
shareholders.
He added: 'Ideally the Post Office should not be privatised at all.'
The Post Office has been profitable without subsidy for 16 years, making a
net profit last year of Pounds 152m on turnover of Pounds 5.1bn. However, a
conventional share flotation could raise Pounds 2bn at a time of escalating
public sector borrowing.
The gap in the committee's schedule arose with the postponement of a session
with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, because of the
crisis over the government's pit closure plans.
