FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Wimpey continues disposal programme with
Pounds 45m sale
GEORGE WIMPEY, the construction group which last year embarked on a disposal
programme to reduce debts, yesterday announced that it had raised a further
Pounds 45m from the sale of St Alphage House, a central London office block.
Since the summer the group has raised Pounds 300m from property sales and
the disposal of its waste management and offshore engineering businesses.
Wimpey yesterday declined to name the purchaser of the 20-storey St Alphage
House which it acquired in 1978. The profit on the sale, given the length of
time the building has been on the group's books, is thought to have been in
excess of Pounds 20m.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, said that the sale would 'further strengthen
the group's balance sheet and investment capability'.
At the end of June Wimpey had net debt of Pounds 372m - equivalent to almost
60 per cent of shareholders' funds. Debts were expected to have been reduced
to less than Pounds 300m by the end of last year following the Pounds 105m
sale of Wimpey's waste management business to a joint venture between Wessex
Water and Waste Management of the US.
In the autumn the group also sold - for Pounds 110m  - its 50 per cent stake
in Little Britain, another central London office development.
The cash from the sale of Little Britain will not become available until the
second half of this year. Other disposals include Wimpey's Coppergate
development in York for about Pounds 20m and the sale for less than Pounds
10m of the group's offshore engineering business.
Last night brokers said the St Alphage sale might help underpin the final
dividend when Wimpey announces its annual results next month which are
expected to show a loss. The dividend is thought to have been under pressure
since the slump in first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 12.6m to just
Pounds 200,000.
