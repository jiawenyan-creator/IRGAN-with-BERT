  [Text] Beijing, 31 May -- Commenting on information that 
China is preparing to conduct a nuclear test, an informed source 
in Beijing said on 31 May, "It is highly possible that China 
will conduct the nuclear test during June, and its scale would 
be larger than the nuclear test that China carried out last 
October." It is believed that with the Clinton administration 
having renewed most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status for China, 
which had been an issue pending between the United States and 
China, the Chinese Government has decided to resume nuclear 
testing.
