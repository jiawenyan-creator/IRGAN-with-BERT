FT  07 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Mickey no foreigner
Sir, May I inform your correspondent Dr Purshouse (Letters, September 3)
that the original exporting was from France to America? We Disneys were
D'Isigny, Isigny being a dairying place in Normandy. The day you published
Purshouse's letter I had a postcard from a Disney family member visiting
this home town of our ancestors.
Two brothers came over with William the Conqueror. The family lived at
Norton Disney in Lincolnshire for 600 years. Then two brothers in the 17th
century moved to Ireland. Walt Disney was descended from one of these two.
He was very interested in the family and I was on a number of occasions,
many years ago, asked by mutual cousins to provide them with family
information to pass on to him.
If the French really do so much object to Mickey Mouse's return to the land
of his ancestral origin, could this perhaps be a latter-day example of a
prophet being without honour in his own country?
