FT  28 JUN 94 / Fierce clashes in north Bosnia
The forces of Bosnia's Moslem-led government, which have gained ground in
recent fighting, were engaged yesterday in fierce artillery duels with Serb
fighters in the north of the republic. A British soldier was killed in an
exchange of fire with Serb troops on Sunday night near the Moslem enclave of
Gorazde in eastern Bosnia, the United Nations said yesterday. He was the
sixth Briton to die in the conflict. The contact group of US, Russian and
west European negotiators is expected to announce a high-level meeting by
next week at which the warring parties in Bosnia will be pressed to accept a
partition formula. Both sides have in recent days pledged to fight on, in
spite of the ceasefire which came into force on June 10 and initially held
quite well. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said the new peace
efforts were doomed to fail because 'Serb soldiers are the only ones who
draw maps on Bosnian territory'.
