FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Higher overseas sales help Tunstall rise to
Pounds 6.47m
Improved overseas sales and continued reorganisation helped Tunstall Group,
the manufacturer of communication and security systems, increase pre-tax
profits from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 6.47m in the year to September 30.
The pre-tax figure for 1992 has been recalculated from Pounds 5.29m to
comply with the FRS 3 accounting standard.
The main impact of FRS 3 was to restate the 1992 figures to take account of
a Pounds 4.1m loss on discontinued operations and a Pounds 1.35m exceptional
profit.
Turnover on continuing operations improved from Pounds 36.2m to Pounds
44.8m, with income from overseas operations up 37 per cent to Pounds 10.5m
(Pounds 7.65m).
Mr Michael Dawson, chairman, said that the performance of Tunstall
International, the division handling overseas sales, had 'become
increasingly important in the development of our business'. The group's
policy of dividing its operations between eight trading companies enabled it
to cut costs and exploit new market opportunities, he added.
Stringent financial controls also bolstered Tunstall's bank balances, up to
Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 2.1m) in spite of substantial capital expenditure.
During the year, the group spent Pounds 1.6m on new product development,
Pounds 2.6m on upgrading its Yorkshire assembly plant and Pounds 500,000 on
the acquisition of Eses, the Spanish security company.
Further expenditure is also planned on Mion Electronics, a new subsidiary
set up last month to take over the design and manufacturing business of
Tunstall Electronics.
The group's positive performance, however, was hampered by a sharp decline
at Tunstall ComSystem, its German subsidiary. Pre-tax profits fell from
Pounds 272,000 to Pounds 59,000 as recession hit trading.
In a move to improve liquidity among such subsidiaries, the group announced
a 1-for-1 scrip issue of new ordinary shares at 5p.
The final dividend is raised to 4.5p (3.75p), making 7p. Earnings per share
rose from 21.6p to 26.5p.
Separately, Tunstall said yesterday it was seeking substantial damages over
the 1988 acquisition of Tann-Synchronome from Anchor Line.
Mr Dawson said the group spent Pounds 265,000 last year on legal costs. The
case, alleging faults in Tann-Synchronome's fire security products, is due
to be heard in June 1994.
