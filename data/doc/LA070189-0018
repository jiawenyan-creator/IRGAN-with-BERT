THERE'S BARELY ROOM FOR SPORTS IN SPORTS SECTIONS THESE DAYS

antitrust laws, awards the United States Football League $3 in damages. 
After the expiration of collective bargaining agreements, divisive labor

jury verdict for antitrust violations committed by Pete Rozelle and the 
National Football League. 
The U.S. Supreme Court, finding that due process of law does not apply to the 
NCAA, reverses an injunction obtained by Jerry Tarkanian prohibiting the NCAA

Gene Klein wins a jury verdict of $10 million in a malicious prosecution action 
against Al Davis, later reduced by the trial judge to $2 million, and

Sports agents Lloyd Bloom and Norby Walters are sentenced to prison and ordered 
to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars of fines after being convicted of fraud 
in signing college athletes and others to illegal contracts. 
A New York Supreme Court judge strips Dennis Conner and the San Diego Yacht 
Club of (the) America's Cup, awarding it instead to Michael Fay and New
