  [Excerpt] Shining Path members hoisted a big flag in San 
Juan de Lurigancho district yesterday [23 January] and asked 
Shining Path members "to lay down the arms" and to obey 
"President Gonzalo." Meanwhile, that evening a terrorist 
commando dynamited the Presidente Hotel in Huancayo, causing 
considerable damage. 
  These two events, which occurred almost simultaneously, and 
the two murders committed by subversives in the city of Huancayo 
prove that inside the terrorist organization there is a radical, 
fanatic group that does not want the "peace agreement" demanded 
by Abimael Guzman and wants to continue to ravage the country 
with selective murders and acts of sabotage. 
  Although there are indications that the Shining Path faction 
that wants to "lay down its arms" (it can be deduced that this 
expression means sort of "cease fire" from their point of view) 
is the majority and predominant sector. It is also obvious that 
the fanatic group who do not want to stop their insane bout of 
murders and attacks is still active in several places in the 
country. 
  From the letters recently written by the Shining Path 
members 
held at Canto Grande prison, and by their leader Cox 
Beuzeville--and also from the big flag displayed yesterday--it 
can be seen that Shining Path members are in no way considering 
surrender, much less giving up their arms. [passage omitted]
