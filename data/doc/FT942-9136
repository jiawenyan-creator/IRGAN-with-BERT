FT  17 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Tea
There was good general demand, reports the Tea Brokers' Association. Bright
liquoring and brighter medium east Africans met strong competition and often
gained several pence. Plainer mediums and poorest Africans were generally
easier. Selected brighter Ceylons were firm, but thinner; plainer sorts were
lower. Strong demand for the larger quantity on offer. Brighter Ceylons and
Zimbabwes were generally dearer but plain Ceylons were irregular and
sometimes easier. Malawis found little support. Prices: best220p/kg, good
155p/kg, good medium 130p/kg, medium 112p/kg, low medium 78p/kg. The highest
price realised this week was 250p/kg for a Rwanda pf. 1.
