All ye who think of church music as ancient choruses from some dusty hymnal, 
take note: 
All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena is singing a different tune. 
Premiering tonight is "Musica Mundial," a concert of culturally diverse, 
modern- 
day religious music for a new world. 
"We're suggesting that our music is the answer to the question, 'What is the 
current-day religious music?' for people who want to feed the hungry, treat men 
and women as equals, save the Earth and promote peace," said Ray Egan, composer 
and music director at All Saints. 
In keeping with the international spirit of musica mundial (which means "world 
music" in Portuguese and Spanish), a five-person band and eight-person chorus 
will perform a number of Latin American-influenced songs with the help of an 
extensive Latino percussion section. 
Most of the songs on tonight's program are being performed for the first time, 
Egan said. About half of the composers are from far-away lands, such as Brazil 
and Argentina. 
Also featured will be a rendition of the 
American poet E. E. Cummings' verse "i thank you God," composed by Egan. 
Egan said some of the music is based on biblical texts and theological themes, 
but as seen through the eyes of the liberation theology movement in emerging 
nations. 
"It's a theology that emanates from our own time as opposed to our 
grandparents' world," Egan said. 
The concert will begin at 7 p.m. at All Saints, 132 N. Euclid Ave. in Pasadena. 
A $5 donation is requested. A second concert is being planned for February, 
1991. MARY ANN SWISSLER
