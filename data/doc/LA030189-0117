BRIEFLY 
Farm Prices Drop: Prices received by the nation's farmers fell 0.7% in February 
after a rise of 1.4% last month, the Agriculture Department said. Lower prices 
for soybeans, lettuce, milk and corn were offset slightly by higher prices for 
tomatoes, strawberries, potatoes, hay and the highest prices for wheat since 
since April, 1981, the department said in its monthly report. The report 
indicates that inflation may be easing, as lower prices received by farmers are 
usually reflected in lower consumer food prices. But it can be months before 
the savings are passed on to the public.
