FT  16 AUG 94 / Clothing and furniture stores show big sales drop
Sales at car dealers and furniture and clothing stores fell significantly
last month, while off-licences and chemists reported a rise in business.
Overall, however, the growth in high street sales slowed in July after
gathering pace in June, according to the Confederation of British Industry's
distributive trades survey, released today.
The survey, which covers 15,000 outlets in retailing, wholesaling and the
motor trades, shows that the proportion of retailers reporting an annual
increase in the volume of sales in July, compared with those who reported a
decrease, was a positive balance of 12 per cent.
This was lower than in June, when 27 per cent of retailers reported an
annual rise in sales volumes. The balance was also significantly lower than
the proportion of traders in the previous survey who had expected sales to
rise in July, suggesting that last month's business left many retailers
disappointed.
Nevertheless, the CBI yesterday noted that the level of sales had been
fairly volatile in recent months, and said business was not signifi-cantly
below average for the time of year.
Mr Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director of economic analysis, said:
'The slower growth in retail sales in July is not surprising when set
against the strong annual volume increases reported this time last year . .
. the trend in retail sales is firmly upwards.'
Motor traders showed the most negative levels of business, with the
proportion reporting that sales had fallen over the year, compared with
those who said they had risen, running at a negative balance of 2 per cent
in July. This was the lowest level since December.
The fall was partly offset by a positive balance of 30 per cent of traders
who said they expected sales to rise next month, after the introduction of
the new 'M' registration plates.
Nevertheless, the CBI pointed out that motor traders' expectations of sales
levels had been overly optimistic in each month since May, and noted that
the majority of them continued to report that their stock levels were
excessive in relation to expected business.
Wholesalers presented a more upbeat picture, with a positive balance of 42
per cent reporting an annual rise in sales. This was lower than in June,
however, and the proportion of wholesalers that said they expected sales to
rise in August fell sharply.
In the retail sector the picture was patchy, although most areas reported a
slowdown in the level of sales growth, and overall volumes of orders placed
on suppliers fell to their lowest for 17 months.
The strongest increases in sales were reported by off-licences, chemists and
grocers. Furniture and carpet traders, however, reported a significant fall
in business, and DIY and durable household goods retailers said sales were
well below average for the time of year, which might reflect the uncertain
nature of the housing market.
The survey suggests larger retailers continued to perform better than small
retailers and mail order groups.
