FT  24 JUN 94 / People: Dominic Cadbury to become chairman at The Economist
A new editor, a new chief executive and now a new chairman. Dominic Cadbury,
54, executive chairman of Cadbury Schweppes, is to take over from Sir John
Harvey-Jones as chairman of The Economist Newspaper, parent of the weekly
business magazine which has just celebrated its 150th anniversary.
The Economist's new chairman is the latest in a series of boardroom changes
at the group which is 50 per cent-owned by the Financial Times. Bill Emmott
took over as editor when Rupert Pennant-Rea left to become deputy governor
of the Bank of England and Marjorie Scardino replaced David Gordon as chief
executive following his move to be chief executive of ITN.
The Cadbury family have been shareholders since 1929 and Dominic Cadbury has
been on the board since 1990. He will succeed Sir John after the agm on July
12. Sir John, who retires having turned 70, took over from Sir Evelyn de
Rothschild, whose family owns 20 per cent of the company.
Under Sir John's seven-year tenure, The Economist's profits have risen by 50
per cent. Last year, the group increased its pre-tax profits by 22 per cent
to Pounds 15m on the back of a 8 per cent rise insales to Pounds 121m. The
average circulation of the weekly magazine rose by 9 per cent to a record
549,000.
