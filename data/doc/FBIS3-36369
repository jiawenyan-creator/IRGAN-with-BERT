  [Text] The journalists who gathered in the Russian 
government building on Thursday [3 February] to highlight the 
meeting of the Cabinet's presidium were told that from now on, 
only ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA reporters would be allowed to attend 
these meetings. 
  As we reported earlier, the post of this newspaper's 
director-general is occupied by Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's former press secretary and advisor Pavel Gurin. 
  The government's spokesman told our correspondent, who was 
denied access to the presidium's first official meeting, like 
his colleagues from ITAR-TASS, RIA and other news agencies, that 
this instruction had been issued by Chief of the government's 
Staff Vladimir Kvasov. 
  He added that the results of the Cabinet's meetings would be 
highlighted during briefings to which reporters would be invited. 
  Our correspondent also reports that over the past two years 
this was the first time when the press was denied access to a 
Cabinet's meeting which did not deal with "closed" issues.
