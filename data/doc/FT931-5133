FT  08 MAR 93 / Clark candidate for Newbury by-election
MR ALAN Clark, the maverick former minister at the centre of the row over
Matrix Churchill, yesterday said he wants to be the Conservative candidate
in the Newbury by-election.
His decision to join hundreds of other aspiring Tories on the candidates'
list for Newbury follows the announcement that he would not be prosecuted
for alleged inconsistencies in his evidence over arms sales to Iraq
negotiated by three executives of the machine tools company.
Mr Clark retired from parliament at the last election after representing
Plymouth Sutton for 18 years. Yesterday he said the 'drug' of politics had
proved too strong.
Senior Conservatives said that his age - he is 64 - and the continuing
controversy over Matrix Churchill would tell strongly against his candidacy
but the choice would rest with local party officials.
