WILANDER SAYS HE WON'T ENTER FRENCH OPEN 
Mats Wilander said today he will miss the French Open, which he has won three 
times, and probably won't play at Wimbledon either this year. 
Wilander, the former No. 1 player who has dropped out of the top 10, said he 
hasn't played tennis since March and won't be in condition to compete in Paris 
later this month. 
"I need at least two or three weeks hard training to compete. After that, 15 to 
20 matches are needed to reach peak form. Physically it would be impossible to 
play in Paris," Wilander said at a news conference publicizing his new 
autobiography. 
Wilander, denying he is quitting the game, said he intends to stay on the 
circuit another two years. But he said he lacks motivation and is taking life 
easy. He lives in Greenwich, Conn. 
"I am not bored with being at home yet. Once I am, motivation will return and 
then I will start playing again." he said. 
"It is hard when you have won so much, not to be able to win tournaments." 
He said he has committed himself to only one tournament this summer, the 
Swedish Open in Bastad.
