FT  11 NOV 93 / Sunday trade options queried
CONFUSION over Sunday trading law in England and Wales could be deepened by
two of the options for reform under consideration by the government, four
leading barristers said yesterday.
The lawyers, who have all been involved in the protracted litigation over
the 1950 Shops Act, warn that if proposals from either the Keep Sunday
Special Campaign or the Retailers for Shops Act Reform are adopted,
compliance and enforcement problems will worsen.
MPs are expected to decide on the change before Christmas with the new law
coming into force by next summer.
The lawyers, led by Mr David Vaughan and Mr John Samuels, say the Keep
Sunday Special Campaign option, which involves a general ban on Sunday
opening with exceptions for some small shops and some types of goods, would
lead to increased uncertainty for retailers, local authorities and the
courts.
The barristers believe this option would hit the activities of banks and
building societies and could effectively outlaw the use of hole-in-the-wall
cash dispensers on Sundays. It would only need one such anomaly to result in
a prosecution for the new law to be questioned, they warn.
The Retailers for Shops Act Reform proposals, which are broadly similar but
allow for open shops on the four Sundays before Christmas, in effect pose
the same problems.
The lawyers say total deregulation to bring the law into line with Scotland
offers the best solution.
They say that even the Shopping Hours Reform Council proposals, which would
allow small shops to open all day but restrict the opening of shops above
280 sq m to six hours, could lead to endless disputes over shop size.
