FT  02 JUL 93 / Indonesian rates fall
INDONESIAN interest rates have fallen to their lowest level for more than
seven years, raising hopes that consumer spending, which has been sluggish
since 1991, may begin to pick up, writes William Keeling in Jakarta.
Bank Rakyat Indonesia, the largest state bank, yesterday lowered its deposit
rates by half a percentage point to 11.5 per cent for one month money, a
move followed by 19 private banks which announced a full point drop in
deposit rates. A fall in lending rates across the board may follow with Bank
Niaga, a leading private bank, yesterday dropping its prime lending rate 1.5
percentage points to 19 per cent.
While interest rates vary widely between banks, deposit and lending rates on
average have now fallen by one-third in the last 12 months.
