FT  09 MAY 94 / Employers' pension fears queried
Employers' fears that the government's proposed pension fund reform will
raise their costs significantly may be overblown, says a study by Bacon and
Woodrow, a firm of consulting actuaries.
The Confederation of British Industry, the UK's largest employers' body, has
said that proposed minimum solvency standards for pension schemes could
force employers to move pension-scheme assets from high-yielding equities
into lower-yielding gilts. Such a move would require employers to inject
additional cash into their schemes and could have the effect of discouraging
pension provision, the CBI said.
However, Bacon and Woodrow said a survey of 112 of its clients' pension
schemes found that more than 90 per cent were 100 per cent solvent. The
standard of solvency was a compromise proposed by the Institute and Faculty
of Actuaries and is less stringent than one proposed by the Goode Committee,
which called for pension law reform.
Only four schemes surveyed were less than 90 per cent solvent, meaning
employers would have to put in extra cash. Most of those not 100 per cent
solvent were executive pension schemes covering restricted groups of
members.
