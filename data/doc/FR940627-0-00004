 

(c) 

Consideration of individuals referred.

 Agencies will give full consideration to individuals referred through OPM's Interagency Placement Program. Full
consideration is a careful and open review of the qualifications of the registrant as described in the individual's
application forms, contact to determine interest and availability, and an interview; if possible, to further assess
the registrant's ability to perform the duties of the position within a reasonable period of time. An appointing officer
may not pass over an IPP eligible to select a non-IPP eligible unless an objection to the IPP eligible is sustained by
OPM or an agency with delegated authority.
