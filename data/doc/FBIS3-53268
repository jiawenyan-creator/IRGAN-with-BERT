  [Excerpts] The National Dialogue Commission [NDC] is 
concluding its multilateral talks with political formations in 
preparation for the convening of the national conference at the 
scheduled date. Jaouida Khaia reports: 
  [Khaia] During the last round of its multilateral talks with 
the dialogue partners which began 5 January, the NDC received 37 
political parties and 27 social associations and organizations. 
Nine small parties did not attend the meetings for undisclosed 
reasons although some of them offered official apologies, 
according to sources close to the NDC. The National Liberation 
Front [FLN] was also absent from the dialogue meeting for the 
first time. [passage omitted] 
  It is to be noted that HAMAS [Islamic Society Movement] is 
the only party which has officially announced that it will 
participate in the national conference. It is expected that the 
position of the other parties will become clear next week after 
a meeting of the leading bodies of the al-Nahdah Islamic 
Movement, the Rally for Culture and Democracy, the FLN, and the 
Movement for Democracy in Algeria.
