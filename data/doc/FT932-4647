FT  08 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P places Chrysler debt on
CreditWatch
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, has placed the BB+ senior
debt rating of Chrysler Corporation, the US car manufacturer, on CreditWatch
with positive implications.
If the company is upgraded, even by a single notch, its rating will be
lifted from speculative to investment grade, which would allow Chrysler to
access a broader investor base and help reduce its funding costs. The move
would be particularly important for Chrysler Financial Corporation, the
credit arm, which is a frequent borrower in the bond markets, according to
Mr Edward Tyburczy, an S&amp;P managing director. Chrysler's rating has improved
steadily since it hit a low point of B+ in 1992.
The agency said that Chrysler's 'earnings and cash flow are significantly
exceeding prior expectations, due largely to overwhelming success with new
products and steps to enhance operating efficiency.'
Chrysler's BB- rated preferred stock has been placed on CreditWatch.
Chrysler has total consolidated debt of Dollars 14bn.
IBCA, the UK-based rating agency, has raised the long-term debt rating of
Standard Chartered, the British bank, from A- to A. IBCA said that in spite
of heavy losses in 1992 due to its exposure to a securities fraud in Bombay,
results were 'not markedly inferior to 1991'.
