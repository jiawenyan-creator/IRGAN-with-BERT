FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Semi-Tech advances 23.5% for the
year
SEMI-TECH (Global), the Hong Kong-based owner of the Singer sewing machine
group, has announced a 23.5 per cent increase in net profits to HKDollars
952m (USDollars 123m) for the year to January 1993, up from HKDollars 771m.
The results included an exceptional gain of HKDollars 578m as a result of
the sale of 16 per cent of its stake in New York-listed Singer. Semi-Tech
retains 51 per cent control of the company.
At the operating level, excluding exceptional items, the company showed a 12
per cent increase in earnings.
Mr James Ting, chairman, said: 'Despite the economic stagnation for most
major economies in the world, the group's performance is satisfactory.'
Semi-Tech recently entered a tentative agreement to purchase a 29 per cent
stake in G. M. Pfaff, a German sewing machine manufacturer, with a further
agreement to increase this stake to 51 per cent.
Mr Ting said: 'Semi-Tech would be able to assist Pfaff restructure, give
Pfaff immediate access to Singer's distribution network, and provide Pfaff
with the right platform to move into China, Vietnam and Latin America.' The
deal would offer synergies with the Singer group, but awaits government and
regulatory approvals.
Semi-Tech is also endeavouring to turn around Sansui, the heavily lossmaking
Japanese consumer audio group it purchased from Polly Peck in mid-1992. It
successfully resuscitated the ailing Singer group, which it purchased in
1989.
The directors recommended a final dividend of 60 cents a share, representing
a full-year pay-out of 83 cents, compared with 76 cents in the previous
year.
In addition, Semi-Tech is to pay-out a special dividend of 30 cents to
reflect the 'turnaround of Singer'.
