  [Text] In a written statement read to reporters this 
morning by Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis, President 
Glavkos Kliridhis says he is not considering any cabinet 
reshuffle and adds that he fully trusts his ministers. 
  Commenting on press reports that he is looking for someone 
to 
replace Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, Kliridhis says he 
fully trusts Mikhailidhis. He adds: The foreign minister has 
played an important role--both general and specific--on the 
confidence-building measures and our efforts to promote 
membership in the European Union. The foreign minister's 
meeting with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has 
appropriately prepared the ground for my own meeting with Hurd. 
  Asked if press reports are harming the foreign minister's 
image, the government spokesman replied: I believe the 
statement that I have just read restores the foreign minister's 
image if it was harmed by the press reports. 
  Asked to comment on the press reports, Mikhailidhis referred 
to Kliridhis' statement, adding that the government has a lot of 
work to do and is not disturbed by press reports. He noted that 
the newspapers might have their own reasons for carrying such 
reports.
