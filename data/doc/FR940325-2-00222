Denial of Petition for Import Eligibility Determination



This notice sets forth the reasons for the denial of a petition submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(``NHTSA'') under section 108(c)(3)(C)(i)(II) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (``the Act''),
15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(C)(i)(II), and 49 CFR part 593. The petition, which was submitted by ICI International, Inc.
of Orlando, Florida ``ICI''), a Registered Importer of motor vehicles, requested NHTSA to determine that a 1971 Daimler
Limousine DR 420 passenger car that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle
safety standards is eligible for importation into the United States because it has safety features that comply with,
or are capable of being modified to comply with, those standards.

NHTSA published a notice in the 

Federal Register 

on June 30, 1993 (58 FR 30570) that contained a thorough description of the petition, and solicited public comments
upon it. One comment was received in response to this notice, from Jaguar Cars Inc. (``Jaguar''), the United States
importer of new motor cars manufactured by Jaguar Cars Ltd., the manufacturer of the 1971 Daimler Limousine. Jaguar
noted that Jaguar Cars Led. never produced a ``DR 420'' model Daimler Limousine, but that it did produce a model ``DS
420.'' ICI subsequently acknowledged that ``DS 420'' is the appropriate model designation for the vehicle that is
the subject of its petition.

In its comments, Jaguar expressed disagreement with ICI's claim that the 1971 Daimler Limousine DS 420, as originally
manufactured, complies with Standard. Nos. 103 Defrosting and Defogging Systems, 104 Windshield Wiping and Washing
Systems, 203 Impact Protection for the Driver From the Steering Control System and 205 Glazing Materials. Jaguar
further asserted that the 1971 Daimler Limousine DS 420 cannot ``be easily modified'' to comply with Standard Nos.
108 Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment, 208 Occupant Crash Protection, 209 Seat Belt Assemblies,
and 210 Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages.

ICI was given an opportunity to respond to Jaguar's comments. In its response, ICI failed to supply sufficient information
to establish that the 1971 Daimler Limousine DS 420 complies with Standard Nos. 103, 104, and 203, and can be easily
modified to comply with Standard No. 210. NHTSA requested ICI to supply this information on six separate occasions
from November 17, 1993 to January 24, 1994, but received no response to any of these requests. This has compelled NHTSA
to conclude, from the state of the record, that it cannot determine that the 1971 Daimler Limousine DS 420 is eligible
for importation. The petition must therefore be denied under 49 CFR 593.7(e).

In accordance with section 108(c)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(C)(ii), and 49 CFR 593.7(e), NHTSA
will not consider a new import eligibility petition covering this vehicle until at least three months from the date
of this notice.






Authority: 

15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(C)(ii); 49 CFR 593.7; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501.8.




Issued on: March 21, 1994.
