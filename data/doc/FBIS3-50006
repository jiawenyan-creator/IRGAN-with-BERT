  [Text] Prague, Jan 18 (CTK) -- The Czech state budget 
recorded a 1.1 billion korunas ($36 million) surplus for 1993, 
Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik told journalists today. Revenues 
totalled 358 billion ($11.93 billion) and expenditures 356.9 
billion ($11.89 billion) Czech korunas, Kocarnik reported. 
  He noted that some minor modification in the figures could 
occur by January 21, but the surplus balance of the budget would 
not change, Kocarnik added. 
  The budget includes a surplus on the clearing account with 
Slovakia amounting to 4.6 billion Czech korunas ($15 million). 
"This means that the final state budget would be higher by this 
sum," Kocarnik said. 
  "In view of the implementation of the new taxation system I 
assess the result as unequivocally successful, as another 
successful transformation step which positively contributed to 
the entire stability of prices, and had an anti-inflationary 
effect," Kocarnik stressed.
