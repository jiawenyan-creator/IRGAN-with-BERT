 

&bull;Donating $90,000 for the purchase and dedication (to a conservation entity approved by the Service) of occupied
goldencheeked warbler habitat,
&bull;Providing operational and maintenance funds ($30,000) for the acquired preserve lands,
&bull;Revegetating developed areas with native vegetation, and
&bull;Onsite dedication of conservation easements totalling 2.2 acres in occupied warbler habitat, with these
areas also containing populations of canyon mock-orange (

Philadelphus ernestii

), a candidate (C2) plant species.
In addition to what is proposed by the Applicant, the Service will require the Applicant to complete the following
activities as part of the permit conditions:
1. Provide territorial mapping surveys for the warbler following International Bird Census Committee or other approved
procedures within and 500 feet out from the southern and western boundaries of Phase A, Section 3 in 1995 (where adjacent
landowners will allow). This area will be surveyed in 1996 and 1997 using the protocol established and in effect by
the Service for presence/absence surveys. This survey format of one territorial survey and two presence/absence
surveys will continue until the third breeding season after buildout of the project site, at which time a final territorial
mapping survey will be completed. Buildout for the residential area is considered to be when 95 percent of the houses
are constructed and occupied.
2. The monies identified in the original PRT777083 and this amendment must be conveyed to an entity approved
by the Service within 30 days of issuance of this amendment.

3. In order to offset the impacts of this development to the maximum extent reasonable and practicable, the Service
believes 48 acres of occupied habitat would be necessary to be purchased and maintained by the Applicant in the Bull
Creek or Cypress Creek watersheld in close proximity to other lands set aside for the conservation of the warbler.
Details of the mitigation proposed are provided in the Canyon Ridge. Phase A, Section 3 Environmental Assessment/Habitat
Conservation Plan. These conservation plan actions ensure that the criteria established for issuance of an incident
take permit will be fully satisfied.

The Applicant considered four alternatives, including an alternate site location, alternate site design, delaying
development until a regional section 10(a)(1)(B) permit is issued, and no action. Details of the mitigation are provided
in the Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan for the Canyon Ridge, Phase A Development.
