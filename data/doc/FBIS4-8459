  [Text] Bratislava, April 14 (CTK) -- Jozef Olej was named 
chairman of the Supreme Inspection Office (NKU) on Wednesday [13 
April] at special session of Parliament. 
  Milan Hudan was elected vice chairman. 
  In 1990-92 Olej was a deputy of the Democratic Left Party 
(SDL) in Czechoslovakia's Federal Assembly (parliament), but 
today he holds no elective office. He last served as president 
of the Law School at Pavol Jozef Safarik University in Kosice, 
east Slovakia. 
  The former chairman and vice chairman were dismissed by 
Parliament on March 24 after Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) 
Chairman Jan Carnogursky presented a report disclosing 
fundamental flaws in the NKU's work.
