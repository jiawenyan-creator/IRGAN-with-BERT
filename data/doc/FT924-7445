FT  17 NOV 92 / Ministers veto extra EC spending
Almost all the European parliament's additions to Community spending plans
for 1993 were rejected last night by EC budget ministers, citing severe
domestic budgetary constraints, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels. The move
points to a budget confrontation between the parliament and the council of
ministers next month, as many MEPs continue to argue that extra spending is
vital to break the deflationary cycle in Europe. The budget ministers
rejected the parliament's proposals that commitments next year to future
spending should rise from Ecu63.91bn (Pounds 52bn) to Ecu70.16bn. Instead,
they sent back a budget which included a meagre 0.2 per cent increase to
Ecu65.86bn.
