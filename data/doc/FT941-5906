FT  04 MAR 94 / Whistleblower wins compensation
The building workers' union Ucatt has won one of the first industrial
tribunal cases under laws giving workers redress for dismissal for raising
health-and-safety concerns.
Mr Matthew Harris, a timber-frame worker of Camberley in Surrey, was awarded
Pounds 8,760 compensation by a Southampton tribunal which ruled he had been
unfairly dismissed by Select Timber, a Basingstoke timber supplier.
Mr Harris had complained of nausea and mood swings while working with the
chemical, Lindane. He was dismissed after calling in a health-and-safety
inspector.
