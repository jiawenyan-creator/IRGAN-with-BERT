U.S. NAVY SHOOTS DOWN 2 LIBYAN JETS 
The Times editorial "America as Vigilante" (Jan. 5) was irresponsible, naive, 
and insulting to the men and women of America's armed forces and their 
families. 
Libya is a world leader in state-sponsored terrorism. Clearly, the facts have 
shown that the Soviet-supplied MIG fighter planes were taking aggressive action 
against U.S. aircraft over international waters. The Libyan jets got exactly 
what they deserved. 
Libya poses a threat to vital U.S. interests in the region. They are a threat 
to Israel and to Arab states in the region who are striving for political 
stability. 
Libyan dictator Col. Moammar Kadafi's sacrificing of two aircraft may have been 
designed to divert attention away from the new chemical weapons plant. What 
else can you say about a country that is even building such a plant in the face 
of worldwide condemnation of such facilities? 
The Times editorial and other "blame America first" commentary only serves to 
undermine the high purpose of our Middle East policy, which aim to bring 
stability to the region and peace to the world.
