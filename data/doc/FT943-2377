FT  20 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Ship identification plan delay
A British government proposal to fit automatic identification devices, or
transponders, on the world's merchant shipping fleet has been put back for a
year after international maritime experts called for further studies, writes
Charles Batchelor, Transport Correspondent.
The Department of Transport put its plans to the United Nations'
International Maritime Organisation (IMO) earlier this month; the department
wants them to be mandatory from 1999. The transponders would allow
coastguard and port authorities to identify vessels and would mean that
ships causing pollution or involved in an accident could be immediately
traced. The IMO's safety of navigation sub-committee called for further
studies of the legal and technical implications of the plans and will look
again at the proposal in a year.
'We will have to see how this initiative fits in with other conventions such
as the UN Law of the Sea which guarantees vessels unrestricted free
passage,' an IMO spokesman said.
