  [Text] Russia may sign the NATO Partnership for Peace 
program in June, well informed sources close to the Russian 
government told Interfax. The Russian Foreign Ministry and the 
Defense Ministry intend to propose that Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin join the NATO program before his official visit to 
Naples for the G7 summit planned for early July. The ministries 
made such a decision after the visit of Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev to the NATO headquarters in Brussels, the same 
sources added. 
  The sources said that in Brussels the NATO defense ministers 
had spoken in favor of Russia joining the Partnership for Peace 
(PP) program. At the same time, the NATO defense ministers 
regarded Grachev's proposal to sign simultaneously the PP 
program and the Russia-NATO program on cooperation "with 
understanding." 
  The same sources told Interfax that the time frame for 
Russia 
joining the PP program would depend on how early the NATO 
defense ministers consider the formula of the Russia-NATO 
program on cooperation.
