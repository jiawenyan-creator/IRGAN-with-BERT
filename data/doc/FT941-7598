FT  24 FEB 94 / Police and students clash in London
Police clashed with students in London yesterday during a demonstration in
protest against cuts in the value of the student grant. About 7,000 students
took part in the march organised by the leftwing Student Activist Alliance.
The action followed the government decision - announced in the November
Budget - to cut grants by 10 per cent in the next academic year. Similar
cuts are planned for the next two years. The shortfall will be made up with
student loans.
The demonstrators forced the closure of Westminster, Lambeth, Waterloo and
Hungerford bridges yesterday afternoon - causing widespread traffic
problems.
The police made three arrests for public disorder but said that otherwise
the demonstrators were 'fairly quiet'.
The alliance hopes to spread its campaign with a national shutdown of
colleges and universities in support of a strike by Natfhe, the lecturers'
union, on March 1.
