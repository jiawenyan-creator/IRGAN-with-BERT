  [Abstract] This is the first of two articles. Mathematical 
modeling with a three-dimensional nonstationary baroclinic model 
with a free surface is used to reproduce the three-dimensional 
structure of the M[.sup]2[/] tidal wave in he barotropic 
Arctic Ocean. The second article describes the results of 
numerical experiments studying the M[.sup]2[/] tidal wave in 
a stratified Arctic Ocean. Here, it is found that the 
oscillations of the level correspond to generally held ideas 
about the tidal wave dynamics of the Arctic Ocean level. The 
main mechanism responsible for the structure of the field of the 
M[.sup]2[/] level in the Arctic Ocean is resonant adjustment 
of level oscillations to morphometric features of the basin. 
Deep ocean is characterized by weak, vertically homogeneous 
currents. Vertical motions in the upper layers of the ocean 
depend on the dynamics of the free surface. As depth increases, 
the bottom relief becomes decisive for the vertical component of 
the tidal wave current. A nonperiodic component is found in the 
barotropic tidal wave current. The effect of the boundary 
between a continental shelf and deep ocean on currents is 
outlined. Figures 7; references 22: 6 Russian, 16 Western.
