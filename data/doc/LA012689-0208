BUSINESS; 
AT&amp;T HAS FIRST LOSS IN 103 YEARS 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. today reported the first annual loss in 
its 103-year history due to a huge accounting charge to write down the value of 
obsolete equipment. Underlying earnings actually strengthened for the telephone 
giant. 
The company reported a net loss of $1.67 billion for last year after a profit 
of $2.04 billion in 1987. Its revenues rose 4.3% to $35.21 billion from $33.77 
billion. In the fourth quarter, its loss was $3.34 billion, compared with a 
profit of $498 million in 1987. Revenues rose 6.4% to $9.21 billion from $8.65 
billion. 
Without the net charge of $3.94 billion, AT&amp;T would have earned $2.27 
billion for the year and $593 million in the quarter, a gain of 19% over the 
prior year's final quarter.
