FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Prospect waits for second half
PRE-TAX losses at Prospect Industries increased, as expected, from Pounds
737,000 to Pounds 1.24m in the six months to March 31.
Traditional seasonality was exacerbated by recent acquisitions, said Mr
Philip Wilbraham, chairman.
Full-year figures would encompass the benefit of the Davenport purchase and
the main trading period of Dunn International, and the interim dividend is
lifted to 0.275p (0.25p) to reflect expectations for the second half.
The group provides specialist engineering services to the power generating
and process industries. For the previous 12 months to September 30 it made
pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.44m.
Turnover in the half year jumped from Pounds 14.7m to Pounds 22.1m, and
orders books were in excess of Pounds 75m, against Pounds 25m last year. The
winning of the turnkey repair and maintenance contract at Ferrybridge Power
Station by Dunn was probably the most significant contract gained.
Losses per share came to 0.56p (0.47p).
