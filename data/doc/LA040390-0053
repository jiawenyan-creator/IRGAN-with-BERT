NEWSWIRE: BOAT DRIVER KILLED; RACE CONTINUES 
A driver in the Parker, Ariz., Enduro Classic was thrown from his power boat 
and killed during Sunday's three-hour marathon on the Colorado River near this 
border community opposite California. 
Witnesses said Dave Griffith, a deputy sheriff from Hawthorne, Nev., was thrown 
over the left forward portion of the boat when it hooked in the north turn of a 
two-mile loop. Griffith lost his crash helmet as he hit the water and was sent 
cartwheeling, witnesses said. 
A caution flag was displayed as emergency teams removed his body from the 
water, but the race continued. 
The race lasted seven hours last year, but was shortened because of insurance 
problems.
