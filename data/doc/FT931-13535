FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Strong end to year for US
regional bank groups
FOURTH-quarter earnings from banks in New England and the Midwest offered
further evidence of the US industry's profits recovery, spurred by wider
interest margins and reduced levels of problem property loans.
Fleet Financial Group of Providence, Rhode Island, had 1992 fourth-quarter
net income of Dollars 82m (52 cents a share), against Dollars 35m (22 cents)
in the last quarter of 1991.
Fleet's full-year earnings were Dollars 280m (Dollars 1.77 per share), up
sharply on Dollars 98m (67 cents) in 1991.
Non-performing assets were reduced by Dollars 619m during 1992, to Dollars
990m, thanks largely to the sale of problem assets.
Shawmut National of Hartford, Connecticut, reported Dollars 10.3m (8 cents
per share) of net income in the fourth quarter, up from Dollars 2.4m (2
cents) a year before.
Shawmut's full-year 1992 net profit was Dollars 75.2m (81 cents) compared
with a loss of Dollars 170.6m (Dollars 2.35) in 1991.
Non-performing loans and foreclosed property declined last year by 19 per
cent at Shawmut, to Dollars 862.4m.
Mr Joel Alvord, chairman of Shawmut, called 1992 'a watershed year'.
He attributed much of the recovery to rising interest income and the
resolution of problem assets.
In Chicago, Continental Bank said it had earned net profits of Dollars 222m
(Dollars 3.44 per share) for the whole of 1992, compared with a loss of
Dollars 76m (Dollars 2.08) in 1991.

share), up from Dollars 50m (77 cents) a year before.
