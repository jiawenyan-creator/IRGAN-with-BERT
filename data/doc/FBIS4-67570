on Streets of Kostroma"] 
  [Text] Kostroma -- "Ikarusz" buses vividly painted with 
slogans in German have appeared on the streets of Kostroma. 
  The newspaper KOSTROMSKIYE VEDOMOSTI [Kostroma Bulletin] 
reports that, before entering Russia, the "Ikarusz'" had 
punctually served Germans in the east of their country. But, in 
the wake of German unification, these buses were decommissioned 
as being environmentally unfriendly and were dispatched to this 
ancient Volga city, whose inhabitants, clearly, are long since 
used to heightened levels of exhaust fumes.
