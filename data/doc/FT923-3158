FT  14 SEP 92 / Jubilee Line is at crucial stage
LONDON TRANSPORT chiefs believe the planned extension of the Jubilee Line to
Docklands will never be built if it is not given the go-ahead in the next
few weeks.
They fear that further delays in reaching a decision on the Pounds 1.8bn
Tube line will cause it to lose its place in the public-spending programme
to CrossRail, the capital's next big transport project.
Construction of the Jubilee Line extension was due to have started in April,
but the project was put on hold after the collapse of Olympia &amp; York, Canary
Wharf developers.
Olympia &amp; York Canary Wharf Ltd had been due to make financial contributions
of about Pounds 170m at today's prices towards the cost of building the
line. The government has said the project will not go forward until someone
else comes up with the money.
Last year's autumn statement provided for the bulk of spending on the
Jubilee Line to be spread over the next three years. However, if no deal has
been struck over Canary Wharf's future before this year's public-spending
round, the government seems likely to defer the planned expenditure.
If that happened, the Jubilee Line would clash with the Pounds 1.7bn
CrossRail scheme, an east-west underground link due to start construction in
1995.
One London Transport executive said: 'You have got to be very optimistic
indeed to believe that the government would allow both these lines to be
built at the same time. So a choice would have to be made between the two -
and if I had to put money on which one would win, I would put it on
CrossRail.'
London Transport is lobbying strongly for the Jubilee Line extension to go
ahead. It says its 500-strong project team is still assessing tenders. It
has provisionally accepted tenders for work worth Pounds 600m. By the
beginning of November the figure will have risen to Pounds 1bn.
