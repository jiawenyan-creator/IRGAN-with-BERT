FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: Write-downs depress Orkla
profits
ORKLA, the Norwegian group with interests ranging from paper to food and
drinks, saw 1992 pre-tax profits almost halve after a write-down on the
group's shareholdings and heavy securities losses. The profit plunged to
NKr315m (Dollars 45.19m) from NKr608m a year earlier.
Orkla was forced to write down by NKr656m its shareholdings in Elkem, the
troubled Norwegian light metals producer, and Uni Storebrand, Norway's
biggest insurer. Orkla has a 30 per cent stake in Elkem and had 4 per cent
of Uni's shares before the insurer collapsed last autumn.
It also suffered securities losses of NKr381m in 1992, against gains of
NKr262m in 1991.
However, operations performed strongly with sales increasing by 4 per cent
to NKr16.8bn last year from NKr16.1bn a year earlier.
Group operating profit increased by 37 per cent to NKr1.2bn in 1992 from
NKr870m in 1991.
The board proposed leaving the dividend payment unchanged at NKr3.75.
Orkla's A shares rose NKr3 to close at NKr190.50 on the Oslo bourse as its B
shares advanced NKr4 to NKr191.
