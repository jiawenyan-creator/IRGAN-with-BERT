FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Takeover of Rentsch by Canon
fuels bid debate
CANON has become the latest bidder to take advantage of the absence of
effective Swiss takeover regulations.
The large Japanese office equipment group has agreed to purchase the
controlling 50.7 per cent stake in Walter Rentsch, a quoted Swiss office
equipment distributor and retailer, from Mr Hubert Looser. Terms have not
yet been finalised. However, no offer is being made to minority
shareholders.
This is the fourth such case in three years of minority shareholders of
Swiss companies being ignored or offered inferior terms in takeover bids.
The others were the Philip Morris takeover of confectionery group Jacobs
Suchard in 1990; the purchase by Mr August von Fink in early 1992 of the
controlling stake in the hotel and restaurant group Movenpick; and the
takeover of the controlling holding in Kardex last year by Industrieholding
Cham.
Each case has provoked criticism in Swiss stock market circles, and new
legislation to eliminate discrimination against minority shareholders is
being considered.
Mr H. J. Scheffer, manager of EC affairs for Canon Europe in Amsterdam, said
yesterday the company's move was 'in line with Swiss practice'. It saw no
reasonable ground for objections.
One Swiss analyst suggested there could be a conflict of interest in that
Canon products accounted for up to 70 per cent of Rentsch sales. The
Japanese group might in the future arrange transfer pricing of its products
to the detriment of the Swiss company's profits, he suggested.
Mr Jurg Zimmerman, chief executive of Rentsch, said the potential for
manipulation was virtually nil, not only for legal reasons, but also because
of the intense international competition in the office electronics sector.
Mr Zimmerman pointed out that Canon reserved the option to make a subsequent
offer to minority shareholders.
