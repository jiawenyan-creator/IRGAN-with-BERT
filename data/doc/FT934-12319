FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Sunset + Vine shows decline to Pounds
505,000
Profits at Sunset + Vine, the independent television production company,
declined from Pounds 687,000 to Pounds 505,000 pre-tax over the 12 months to
June 30.
Mr Colin Frewin, chairman, said the outcome reflected 'the continuing state
of flux in the UK television industry.'
He added: 'The impact of the first six months of the new independent
television era, complicated by the new commissioning structure of the ITV
network . . . together with the weakness of the economy had combined to make
growth in the television business a very difficult task.'
Turnover fell from Pounds 4.51m to Pounds 4.13m. Earnings were 6.1p (8.8p).
A proposed final dividend of 2p makes a maintained 3.5p total.
Mr Noel Healy has been appointed managing director. He was formerly a
director with Financiere Indosuez.
