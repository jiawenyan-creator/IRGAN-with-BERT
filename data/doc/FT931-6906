FT  26 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI wins brokers' approval
THE ANNOUNCEMENT by ICI of a Pounds 1.3bn rights issue to fund the demerger
of its pharmaceuticals and chemicals divisions was followed, perhaps
surprisingly, by a 6.5 per cent jump in the share price. This represented
the sharpest rise in the FT-SE 100 index list and one of the biggest in the
London market. The last time the shares saw a similar price hike and trading
volume was in July 1992, when ICI first announced its intention to create
Zeneca as a separate pharmaceuticals arm.
The initial announcement of a pre-tax loss of Pounds 384m and the need to
cut 9,000 jobs was not encouraging and the shares moved up by less than 10p,
in spite of short covering by London brokers. However, at a packed meeting
with analysts the company announced that barring unforeseen circumstances it
would hold its traditional 55p dividend after the split.
Analysts returned to examine the yield on the stock and decided that a fair
share price was about 1,200p. Mr Jeremy Chantry of Kleinwort Benson is
looking for a combined share price 'north of 1200' and Mr Charles Lambert of
Smith New Court, who has taken a bearish view of the group's prospects, also
took a less gloomy attitude. Some analysts felt that, with the dividend
guaranteed, the shares are now virtually as secure as gilts and at a better
return.
The shares raced ahead to close 70 1/2 up at 1152 1/2 - but still lower than
they were immediately after the original Zeneca announcement  - on turnover
of 13m. By the time the UK market had closed a further 2m shares had been
traded on Wall Street and the share price there had reached the equivalent
of 1,162p. A further 3m shares changed hands in the form of traded options.
