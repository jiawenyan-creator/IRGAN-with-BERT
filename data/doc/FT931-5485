FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: N&amp;P declines 22% to Pounds 80.2m
NATIONAL &amp; Provincial, Britain's eighth biggest building society, saw
pre-tax profits drop 22 per cent to Pounds 80.2m in 1992, after making bad
debt provisions of Pounds 108.7m.
Specific provisions on residential property rose to Pounds 88.2m (Pounds
23m) and the society also increased its general provisions to Pounds 10.8m
(Pounds 1.7m). Total provisions were more than double 1991's Pounds 52.1m.
Operating profits rose by 22 per cent to Pounds 188.9m (Pounds 155m), thanks
to an increase in net interest income to Pounds 252.4m (Pounds 213.3m).
N&amp;P's solvency ratio increased to 12.7 per cent from 11.1 per cent.
The society has made a commitment to keep depositors informed about savings
rates, following a wave of publicity that investors with other societies had
languished in obsolete accounts. While the society said it had attracted
over 400,000 new savings customers in 1992, Mr Alistair Lyons, finance
director, estimated the commitment had cost the society Pounds 20m during
the year.
