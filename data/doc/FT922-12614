FT  16 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo gains on buying by
investment trusts
INVESTORS were encouraged by Tuesday's advance on Wall Street, and share
prices extended gains, briefly rising above the 18,000 level, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average rose 508.43 to 17,948.01. After opening at the day's low
of 17,492.47, the index gained on large-lot orders by leading Japanese
brokers. The index advanced to the day's high of 18,041.45, recovering the
18,000 mark for the first time in seven trading days.
Volume increased to 350m shares from 250m. Investment trusts and dealers
were main buyers, while pension funds also placed orders at lower levels.
Foreigners were seen buying in small lots.
Advances led declines by 956 to 100, with 71 issues remaining unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section shares moved up 33.19 to 1,321.99. In
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.27 to 1075.22.
The overnight rise of the Nikkei futures in Chicago also prompted buying in
the futures market. Mr Nick Cant at Baring Securities said the rise, in
spite of the lack of fresh news, was encouraging. He added that domestic
institutions' purchases of high-technology stocks supported sentiment.
Large orders were placed in the electronics sector, where stocks rose on
active trading. Hitachi, the most active issue of the day, rose Y16 to Y831
and Sony added Y190 to Y4,300.
Machinery issues, potential beneficiaries of the government's promotion of
labour-saving measures, gained ground. Amada rose Y60 to Y1,1170 and Takuma
added Y31 to Y911.
Speculative favourites were sought by short-term players. Nippon Carbon
continued its rise, gaining Y60 to Y711, and Citizen Watch rose Y36 to Y869.
Bank shares were higher: Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y110 to Y1,820 and
Mitsubishi Bank advanced Y70 to Y1,820.
Aids-related issues fell on profit-taking, with Okamoto Industries down Y20
to Y1,160 and Mochida Pharmaceutical easing Y60 to Y2,990. Teac, an
electronics maker, which has been promoted by Japanese brokers recently on
the 'US recovery theme', lost Y10 to Y1,030.
Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, lost Y490 to Y8,350. The issue has
fallen 16 per cent over the past three days, on an alleged patent
infringement.
In Osaka, the OSE average surged 517.44 to 19,861.74 with 24.5m shares
traded. Foreigners and domestic institutions sought high-technology issues,
but pharmaceuticals were depressed on profit-taking. Nintendo rose Y120 to
Y9,620, while Ono Pharmaceutical lost Y80 to Y6,200.
