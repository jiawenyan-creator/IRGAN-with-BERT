FT  22 NOV 93 / Management: Quality yardsticks
What criteria should be used for judging good, quality managers? It ought to
be a routine question for organisers of the many UK business award schemes,
but too often it is not properly addressed.
Tomorrow, however, management awards will be made at a lunch in London,
based on the qualities which three separate audiences - main board directors
of the top 500 UK companies, fund managers and City and business editors -
consider important for generating sustainable growth.
The exercise was kicked off by Sundridge Park, a corporate development
practice in the PA Consulting Group, which defined 18 criteria identified
through close observation of well-managed organisations. These criteria were
then put to a representative sample of the three groups, which were each
asked to select their top five.
Significantly, strategic thinking came out ahead of the others in all three
surveys, with leadership second in all three.
At that point the consensus cracked, fund managers and City editors
emphasising the importance of external yardsticks such as investment
planning and research and development, while the industrial leaders
preferred people and team development. Innovation, however, was somewhere in
everybody's top five.
Of those currently low on the list, Sundridge Park believes career
management will move up the corporate agenda in the next few years. The onus
in future, however, will rest more on the individual than the company, with
the latter playing a mainly supportive role.
