  [Text] Ukraine's Ambassador Extraordinary and 
Plenipotentiary to the United States of America Oleg Bilorus 
handed U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott the text of 
the 3 February 1994 resolution by the Supreme Council of Ukraine 
on full-scale ratification of START I and the Lisbon Protocol. 
During the conversation at the U.S. State Department, Oleg 
Bilorus stressed that Ukraine legally confirmed the consistency 
of the policy toward achieving a non-nuclear status, conducted 
by the president and the government. 
  On his part, Strobe Talbott pointed out that the decision by 
the Ukrainian parliament makes its possible to significantly 
increase U.S. aid to our state toward the implementation of the 
programs of dismantling and eliminating nuclear weapons 
stationed on its territory. He also put special emphasis on the 
personal contribution and political courage of the president of 
Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, who had been defending consistently 
and selflessly the necessity of the full-scale ratification of 
START I and the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty by 
Ukraine.
