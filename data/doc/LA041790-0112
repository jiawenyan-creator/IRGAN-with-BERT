BRIEFLY 
Axa Midi Requests Continuance: The company that is attempting to buy Farmers 
Insurance Group of Los Angeles asked to delay regulatory hearings on its 
purchase of Farmers for about 60 days so that it can restructure its bid. 
The request follows rejection of Axa Midi Assurances' takeover offer by the 
California Department of Insurance, which maintained that the bid was too 
highly leveraged. Axa Midi must obtain approvals from insurance regulators in 
nine states to complete the deal. Axa plans to buy Farmers from a group led by 
Sir James Goldsmith.
