November 23, 1994. 


The recently enacted Unlisted Trading Privileges Act of 1994 (``Act''), Public Law 103389 (codified as amended
at 15 U.S.C. 78l (f) (1) to (3) (1988)), which became effective on October 22, 1994, authorizes any national securities
exchange to extend unlisted trading privileges to any security that is listed and registered on a national securities
exchange, otherwise registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or exempt from registration,
all in accordance with the requirements and limitations of the Act and the rules thereunder.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Prior to the amendment, exchanges were required to apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
and receive approval from the Commission before extending unlisted trading privileges to any security. The Act eliminated
these requirements. 


<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
The Act initially requires a national securities exchange to wait until the third day of trading before extending
unlisted trading privileges to any security that is listed and registered on another national securities exchange
and is the subject of an initial public offering. The Act directs the Securities and Exchange Commission, however,
to prescribe, before April 21, 1995, the permanent period, if any, that exchanges must observe before extending unlisted
trading privileges to any such securities. 
</FOOTNOTE>


As a result, any national securities exchange that has previously applied to the Commission for approval of unlisted
trading privileges in any security may extend unlisted trading privileges to such security in accordance with the
terms of the Act, notwithstanding that the Commission has yet to approve the exchange's outstanding application.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the Commission is publishing this notice to inform interested persons that no further Commission action
on these applications is necessary. For further information, interested persons may contact Glen P. Barrentine,
202/942.0145, Senior Counsel, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange
Commission, Mail Stop 51, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington D.C. 20549.
