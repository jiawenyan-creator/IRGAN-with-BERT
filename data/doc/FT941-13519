FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney excites US appetites
Euro Disney, the financially crippled leisure group, faces the new threat of
a growing secondary market in its debt following the sale at a 'distressed'
price of a second parcel of its loans by one of the original creditors.
The transaction, believed to have been concluded last week, follows the sale
earlier this month of a FFr130m (Dollars 22.26m) portion of debt by Midland
Bank. The second deal, according to market sources, involved less than
FFr100m of loans and was struck at around 60 per cent of the original value,
roughly the same price as the first sale.
US institutional investors have identified Euro Disney, which is completing
an emergency financial restructuring, as a long-term recovery stock.
Analysts reported strong demand for Euro Disney loans on the buoyant US
secondary debt market.
M. J. Whitman, a New York-based debt broker, is today staging a presentation
in Paris for Euro Disney's creditor banks in the hope of persuading them to
sell their debt for a 'distressed' price to its clients. It expects 20 of
the 60 banks to attend.
'There is considerable interest in Euro Disney loans on the secondary
market,' said Mr Andrew Arthur, Whitman managing director. 'This market is
well developed in the US but still embryonic in Europe. We want to explain
the nature of the market to the banks.'
Mr Arthur claimed that Whitman had already identified prospective purchasers
for 'more than half' of Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn net debt. Other secondary
debt specialists confirmed high interest among US investors.
Another US debt broker said: 'There's a real shortage of interesting
distressed investments right now. That's why Euro Disney seems so
attractive. The only problem is persuading the original creditors to sell.'
But further selling of Euro Disney debt could imperil the restructuring by
destabilising the negotiating process.
