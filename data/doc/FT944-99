FT  31 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow higher on mixed day for
data
Wall Street
Investors not already on vacation finished the year with a mixed performance
in very light trading yesterday, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen 1.01 at 3,834.44.
The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dropped 1.90 at 459.27, the
American Stock Exchange composite rose 2.31 at 433.67 and the Nasdaq
composite rose 2.43 at 751.96. Trading volume on NYSE was 256m shares.
Share prices, which many analysts had expected to rally on the last trading
day of the year, were not helped by sinking bond prices. The long bond
dropped nearly half a point in very thin trading and the two-year note was
off slightly. The bond market closed at 2pm in advance of Monday's holiday.
Economic data was mixed. Sales of new single family houses fell by 2.5 per
cent in November, but data released by the Purchasing Management Association
of Chicago showed business activity up to a stronger than expected 67.5 per
cent in December. Economists had expected a slight decrease to 65.0 per
cent.

Dollars 30 3/8 on news that the health services company was in discussions
about a possible merger with Foundation Health. Shares in Foundation Health
dropped Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 30 5/8 after the company announced the

The B shares of Viacom gained Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 40 3/4 after reports
that a sale of the company's cable systems was imminent. TCI Communications,
down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 21 3/4 , was said to be among the group
involved in the acquisition.
After rebounding moderately on Wednesday and Thursday, Mexican shares fell
yesterday morning as companies began to report their foreign exchange losses
due to the peso's precipitous decline. Grupo Sidek, down Dollars  1/4 at
Dollars 10 1/8 , said it expected a foreign exchange loss of Dollars 104m.
Telmex lost Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 41.

Toronto stocks closed the year on a positive note, making modest gains in

cent, to 4,213.61, with winners predominating over losers by 491 to 225.
