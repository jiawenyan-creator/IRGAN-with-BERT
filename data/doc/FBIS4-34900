  [Text] President-elect Ernesto Samper has asked THE MIAMI 
HERALD to correct its position, and President Cesar Gaviria 
expressed his support for the president-elect. 
  [Begin recording] [Gutierrez] For the first time, President 
Gaviria talked about the attempt to infuse the presidential 
campaigns with drug trafficking money, as detailed by the 
recordings he received from Andres Pastrana four days prior to 
the elections. 
  [Gaviria] All Colombians want a thorough investigation to 
yield results soon in order to dispel doubts. 
  [Gutierrez] President Gaviria expressed support for the 
president-elect, who announced that, should he find out that any 
member of his team is involved, he would dismiss him from any 
post he might occupy in the government. 
  Meanwhile, Vice President-elect Humberto De la Calle, who is 
a member of the Promoters Committee for the Penalization of Drug 
Consumption, said the new administration will relentlessly fight 
drug traffickers. 
  [De la Calle] First, we will continue the military and 
police 
fight against drug traffickers. 
  [Gutierrez] There will also be new laws to penalize money 
laundering and appropriations. [end recording] 
  [Madrid EFE in Spanish at 0059 on 25 June transmits a 
175-word Santa Fe de Bogota-datelined report citing De la Calle 
as saying: "It will become a fight to arrest and make drug 
traffickers pay the debts they owe to Colombian society." The 
report adds: "The new government will submit two bills to 
increase drug traffickers' prison terms by means of a reform of 
the Penal Code, thereby closing the gap on `certain legal limbos 
and loose interpretations' that let criminals enjoy prison terms 
shorter than the ones they deserve. De la Calle also pointed out 
that the new administration will make money `laundering' a crime 
in Colombia and will seek international cooperation to trace the 
routes travelled by illegal money."]
