FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: PM's letter accepts Lamont's decision
10 DOWNING STREET
LONDON SW1A 2AA
THE PRIME MINISTER
Dear Norman,
I told you this morning that I had decided to make some changes to the
Government. I had hoped that you would feel able to remain as a senior
member of the Cabinet; but I respect and accept your decision not to stay
on. I believe the economic policies you have followed as Chancellor will be
seen to have created the conditions for renewed and sustainable economic
growth in this country.
You have served with distinction in successive Governments since 1979. You
have made a significant contribution to economic and financial policy, first
as Financial Secretary to the Treasury, then as Chief Secretary and since
1990 as Chancellor of the Exchequer. You steered through some of our major
privatisations. You have not hesitated to take difficult decisions on public
spending and you have presented three tax reforming budgets - including the
second one which did so much to help us win the last Election. You shared
with me an overriding objective as Chancellor to bring down inflation, and
you have succeeded in reducing it to its lowest rate for nearly 30 years.
That has been an outstanding achievement.
Norma joins me in sending our best wishes to you and to Rosemary who has
supported you wonderfully through a difficult time.
Yours Ever, John
The Right Honourable Norman Lamont, MP
