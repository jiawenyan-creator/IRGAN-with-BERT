Applicant's Representations



1. Applicant, a diversified open-end management company, is a Separate Account formed under Connecticut insurance
laws by The Travelers Insurance Company (``Travelers''), a life insurance company domiciled in Connecticut. 

2. On July 3, 1975, Applicant filed a Notice of Registration on Form N8B1 under section 8(b) of the 1940
Act (File No. 8112583) and a Registration Statement on Form S5 under the Securities Act of 1933 (File
No. 254173) to register units of interest of variable annuity contracts (``Contracts''). Applicant's Registration
Statement became effective on April 30, 1976. The initial public offering commenced on May 1, 1976.

3. On November 19, 1993, the Contracts were exchanged for another Travelers' variable annuity contract (``New Contract'')
pursuant to an offer of exchange extended by Travelers to Contractowners on September 10, 1992. All Contractowners
contacted either consented to the offer to exchange or surrendered their contracts. The New Contract has as an investment
option The Travelers Quality Bond Account for Variable Annuities (``Account QB''). Account QB is an investment company
with identical investment objectives, adviser and management fees as that of the Applicant. All units in Applicant
held under the existing contracts were exchanged for units of equal value in Account QB under the New Contract. The
offer of exchange was made in compliance with Rule 11a2 under the 1940 Act. All portfolio securities of the Applicant
were transferred to Account QB, valued on the basis of net asset values of the securities as determined in accordance
with the methods set forth in the Statement of Additional Information of the Applicant and Account QB. No brokerage
commissions were paid. The transfer of portfolio securities was made pursuant to a Commission order under section
17(b) granting an exemption from section 17(a) of the 1940 Act. (Release No. IC19232, File No. 8128172.)

4. As of November 18, 1993, Applicant had 630,239.9891 units of interest outstanding and net assets of $2,773,229.14,
representing 4.388301 Contracts issued prior to December 23, 1983 and 4.284953 Contracts issued subsequent to that
date.

5. Any expenses connected with the offer of exchange or the liquidation of the Applicant will be paid by Travelers.

6. Applicant has not remaining assets, and no debts or liabilities remain outstanding. No distributions were made
to Applicant's security holders. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceedings. There
are no security holders of Applicant.

7. Applicant is not now engaged nor does it propose to engage in any business activities other than those necessary
for the winding-up of its affairs.

8. Applicant has not, within the last 18 months, transferred any of its assets to a separate trust, the beneficiaries
of which were or are security holders of Applicant.

9. Travelers intends to notify the Connecticut and New York Insurance Departments, each having approved the transfer
of assets, that it no longer intends to utilize the Applicant as a separate account.

10. Applicant has made on a timely basis all filings required on Form NSAR. Applicant's last filing on Form NSAR
for the period ended June 30, 1993, was made on or before August 30, 1993.
