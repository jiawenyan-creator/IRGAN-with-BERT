FT  25 FEB 94 / People: de Zoetes still in evidence
The integrated securities houses that grew out of Big Bang in the City of
London have swallowed many of the grand old names of British stockbroking;
often the scions of the families themselves are no longer about either.
So Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm of Barclays, is rather
the exception, as is Simon de Zoete, 52, who has just been promoted to
become chairman of BZW's equities division.
Another de Zoete, his 46-year-old younger brother Nick, also works for the
firm in a portfolio management role. The two are great-nephews of Johnny
Bevan, senior partner at de Zoetes until he died in the 1970s.
Previously chairman of the corporate broking arm de Zoete &amp; Bevan, part of
the 1,100-strong equities division, de Zoete succeeds Tim Coghlan who is
retiring at the end of March on his 55th birthday. Coghlan, who has spent 34
years in the City, stays on in a consultancy role.
De Zoete will be working with the division's chief executive Jonathan Davie
and deputy chief executive John Varley. He will continue with the corporate
business he has made his speciality, where his clients include BAT, GEC,
Zeneca and ICI.
He steps down to deputy chairman at de Zoete &amp; Bevan, with Nick Brigstocke,
currently in that seat, moving up to chairman.
BZW has had a good run recently. Last week it was appointed joint broker
with Cazenove to BTR, and has also been appointed lead broker on the planned
flotation of 3i. Meanwhile, Simon de Zoete has more urgent matters on his
hands; he is leading the Granada team in its takeover battle with LWT.
