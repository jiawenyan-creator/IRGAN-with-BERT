FT  22 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Eurobond debut for Republic
of Colombia
THE Republic of Colombia will make its debut in the Eurobond market next
week with a Dollars 125m five-year bond issue aimed at establishing a
benchmark for external fund-raising.
The proceeds will be used to pay off existing borrowings. Colombia's
external debt has remained at between Dollars 17bn and Dollars 18bn for the
past six years, about 34 per cent of last year's estimated GDP.
Mr Rudolf Hommes, finance minister, said he expected Colombian borrowers -
public and private - to follow over time, but there would no flood of issues
and the country's debt ratios would continue to decline in coming years.
Ecopetrol, the Colombian state oil company, would probably be the most
active borrower. Ecopetrol is scheduled to launch a debut Eurobond of
Dollars 120m next month.
As a guide to the yield spread for the republic's new issue, Bankers Trust
International, lead managers, pointed to the United Mexican States 7 1/4 per
cent bond due 1998, launched in February at 208 basis points above the
benchmark five-year US Treasury.
However, some Latin American debt analysts said that Colombia's first issue
should come at a small premium to the latest Mexican bond, suggesting the
220-230 basis point range.
Colombia is not rated by either Standard &amp; Poor's or Moody's, but Bankers
Trust says it should attract an investment grade rating. The factors
stressed were: the country's sound record on servicing debt - it did not
reschedule its borrowings in 1980s debt crisis; the economic growth rate,
which has averaged 3.4 per cent a year in real terms since 1980; the current
account surplus; and a negligible budget deficit.
Representatives of merchant banks at yesterday's presentation in London
agreed that Colombia had a good economic record, but pointed to political
and social risks, including the activities of terrorist groups and drug
traffickers.
