  [Text] Beijing, February 7 (XINHUA) -- In 1993 China's 
total grain output hit a record 456.4 million tons, despite the 
fact that the total grain area had shrunk over the previous few 
years. 
  The figure means that the total grain production increased 
by 
50 percent in three leaps between 1979 and 1993. 
  The country's total grain output was 300 million tons in 
1979, 354.5 million tons in 1982, 407.3 million tons in 1984, 
and 456.4 million tons in 1993. 
  According to analyses done by foreign economists, out of 
every extra 50 kg of grain harvested worldwide between 1980 and 
1991 20 kg were increased in China.
