FT  26 AUG 92 / Offer of a sovereign for Queen Mary
SEA CONTAINERS, the Bermuda-based shipping group, has offered to pay one
sovereign for the Queen Mary, the lossmaking liner moored as a tourist
attraction in California, Tim Burt writes.
The group wants to return the ship to Southampton to be used as an upmarket
hotel, conference centre and casino.
Sea Containers says the offer is realistic because the former flagship of
the Cunard shipping line is almost worthless. Its offer is one of 18 being
considered by the city of Long Beach, which paid Cunard Dollars 3.45m for
the Queen Mary in 1967 after it was taken out of service. The city has spent
Dollars 66m refurbishing the vessel.
One Japanese consortium is offering Dollars 23m (Pounds 11.5m) for the Queen
Mary conditional on it being made seaworthy by the Long Beach Naval
Shipyard.
Sea Containers has asked Long Beach to allow it to match any rival bid and
has paid a Dollars 100,000 deposit. Under its proposals, the ship would be
towed to a shipyard in the Far East where it would be refitted before being
returned to Southampton.
The project is backed by the city council and Associated British Ports which
has agreed to provide a berth at a nominal rent in Southampton Docks. Total
costs of the project are estimated at Dollars 30m.
Long Beach decided to sell the ship after Walt Disney Entertainment, the
latest operator, decided not to renew its lease.
