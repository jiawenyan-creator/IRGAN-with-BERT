NO SENSE OF PLACE 
We read today, with a mixture of nostalgia, disgust and outrage, Amy Louise 
Kazmin's article regarding the proposed demolition of the Munch Box in 
Chatsworth in order to build yet another sterile, ugly and unnecessary 
mini-mall. 
Nostalgia for the many years that we have spent perched on a stool in front of 
the Munch Box, enjoying a meal and watching the world roll by; disgust and 
outrage at the shortsighted individuals in Los Angeles city government and 
private enterprise, working together to rob Chatsworth of one of its few 
remaining local landmarks. 
Industrializing the West Valley may increase the tax base for Los Angeles, but 
it has brought nothing but congestion, crime and blight to this once pretty and 
peaceful corner of L.A. 
Have the people in City Hall no sense of place? Have they no regard for their 
working class constituents? This is yet another example of the continued 
erosion of the quality of life in Los Angeles, and in Chatsworth in particular, 
for the benefit of a greedy few.
