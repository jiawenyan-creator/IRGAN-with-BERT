MORNING REPORT: CULTURE 
The crisis facing the Massachusetts Council on the Arts and Humanities has been 
tempered slightly by a compromise in the state Legislature that will give the 
group half of its expected $19.5 million budget. The council was facing 
extinction, hit not only with a budget deficit but also word that the 
Legislature might kill its budget entirely. But the legislators voted a 
comprise $9.5 million for the council and the final budget will be worked out 
between the state's House and Senate. Angered supporters regard the cut as a 
tragedy, the New York Times reported. The council disperses grant money to 
cultural institutions and artists. ALEENE MacMINN
