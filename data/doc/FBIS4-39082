  [Text] Tiraspol BASAPRESS, 3/6/1994 -- The Tiraspol Court 
examined today the case of Colonel Bergman [commander of an army 
division] who is being sued by Igor Smirnov, president of the 
Dniester Republic, who claims moral damages. Smirnov estimated 
at 100 million rubles the damages caused by Bergman's 
disclosures, especially regarding the $1.5 million the Tiraspol 
leader withdrew from accounts with Austrian banks. As a 
witness, Tiraspol Finance Minister Oleg Natakhin confirmed that 
in November 1993 he was in Vienna with Smirnov and Coloti, from 
the Dniester Republic's bank, intending to open a correspondent 
account of the Dniester bank in an Austrian bank. Natakhin said 
he does not know whether Smirnov withdrew the $1.5 million. 
Colonel Bergman made a statement asserting that the court 
violates the penal code and the legal procedures and it is 
biased. A recess has been called: The trial will continue when 
another judge is appointed. The date of the next session was 
not specified. The court hall was surrounded by women waving 
banners with insults against General Lebed [commander of the 
14th Russian Army stationed in Dniester] and Colonel Bergman.
