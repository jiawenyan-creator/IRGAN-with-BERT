  [Text] A research group led by Yoshihiro Hamagawa at Osaka 
University's Basic Engineering Department achieved a 
photoelectric transfer efficiency of 21%, the highest in 
the 
world, with a tandem-type solar cell made with layers of 
amorphous (non-crystalline) silicon and polycrystalline silicon. 
The researchers tinkered with the thickness of the 
power-generating layer, among other things, to increase the 
typical transfer efficiency by 0.7%. Having achieved an 
efficiency on par with that of single-crystal silicon, the 
group's tandem-type solar cell made with two types of relatively 
cheap silicon was a step toward making solar cells practical. 
  The group consists of Professor Yoshihiro Hamagawa, 
Assistant 
Professor Hiroaki Okamoto, and assistant [character not found] 
Ma. The solar cell is a 5-mm[.sup]2[/] so-called tandem type 
of solar cell that has a power-generating layer of amorphous 
silicon on top of a power-generating layer of polycrystalline 
silicon. 
  The tandem-type solar cell can convert sunlight into 
electricity more efficiently than single-layer solar cells 
because the light that the amorphous layer cannot absorb is 
absorbed by the polycrystalline layer. 
  The research group achieved a transfer efficiency of 
20.3% 
in 1992, but this time they cut the thickness of the amorphous 
layer down to 100 nm, or one-fourth of what it was, so that more 
light can reach the lower polycrystalline layer. Even if the 
amorphous layer is thinner, its photoelectric transfer 
efficiency does not change. 
  In connection with enlarging the area, Okamoto says, ``Even 
if we make it much larger, we can realize about the same 
efficiency.'' A shortcoming of amorphous silicon is that it 
deteriorates over time, but if the amorphous layer is thin, 
deterioration becomes less of a worry. 
  Because Osaka University's tandem-type solar cell is made of 
amorphous silicon and polycrystalline silicon, it can be 
produced at a temperature around 250C. The production is 
simple, too -- each substance is just crystallized into a layer. 
  Other solar cells such as those made of single-crystal 
silicon are more expensive because a high temperature close to 
1,000C is needed to make them, and semiconductor 
fabricating processes are used to achieve high efficiency. ``If 
advances are made in technology for processing a polycrystalline 
layer into a film, close-to-practical tandem-type solar cells 
can be made,'' says Okamoto.

  Using single-crystal silicon, Sharp achieved an efficiency 
of 
22% with a 2-cm[.sup]2[/] solar cell, and 21% with a 
practical-sized 4-cm X 6-cm cell. A group at Australia's New 
South Wales University also achieved 23.1% with a 
2-cm[.sup]2[/] solar cell, but the fabrication process they 
use is complex. Sanyo Electric holds the record for amorphous 
silicon, 12% with a 10-cm[.sup]2[/] solar cell, and Kyocera 
holds the record for polycrystalline silicon, 16.4% with a 
15-cm[.sup]2[/] solar cell, but those efficiencies are not as 
high as that obtained with single-crystal silicon.
