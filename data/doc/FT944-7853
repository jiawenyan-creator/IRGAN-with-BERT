FT  23 NOV 94 / Hotels key to PPI's Cyprus assets
Administrators to Polly Peck International said yesterday that the seizure
of two hotels still controlled by Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman
and former PPI chairman, took them closer to gaining access to PPI's assets
in northern Cyprus.
Mr Chris Barlow, a partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand and lead administrator, said
he believed northern Cyprus government sequestrators had been appointed to
the Jasmine Court and Palm Beach hotels to recover funds that could be used
to pay an estimated Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 910,000) of taxes and social
security payments owed by Voyager Kibris, a PPI subsidiary.
He understood that the hotels would continue to trade and be returned to the
lawful directors of Voyager Kibris once the debts had been paid. Mr Barlow
said: 'I view this latest action as a step towards gaining access to Polly
Peck assets in northern Cyprus.'
Since 1990 the administrators have been prevented by a series of injunctions
and court orders initiated by Mr Nadir, from gaining access to the group's
assets in north Cyprus. According to its 1989 accounts about two-thirds of
PPI's profits came from its Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot businesses.
Mr Barlow said the seizure of the hotels would allow their revenues to be
used to 'discharge legitimate liabilities of Voyager Kibris'.
