FT  13 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
Stock index futures fell steeply in average trading volume, running up a
sizeable discount to cash equities and triggering negative arbitrage
business, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 2934 at the close of pit trading, down
31 points for a decline of 82 points over the past two sessions.
Having traded in the 16 points range for much of the day the discount to the
cash market at the close was around 10 points or eight points under fair
value.
Activity was again little better than average despite the appearance of one
big seller, Goldman Sachs, which pushed through 500 lots during the morning
session.
Contracts traded totalled 18,839, but more than 5,000 of this was spread
trading into the March contract, so underlying activity was again little
better than average.
Apart from Goldman Sachs' mid-morning swoop, activity was mostly confined to
local, independent traders and fairly extensive dealer arbitrage.
Although the discount to cash equities was at times wide, there was rarely
any real weight of selling or concerted attempts to drive the cash market
down, traders said.
Stock option volume was 28,048, against 33,615 on Friday. Call and put
volume was evenly matched with FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trades accounting for
more than 16,000 lots.
