  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has called on the United 
Nations to write down the promises it made in Vienna in a 
document. 
  Denktas is continuing to hold contacts in Turkey. He met 
with President Suleyman Demirel yesterday. Replying to 
reporters' questions after the meeting, Denktas said that, if 
the promises made in Vienna are submitted to him in written 
form, he will take them to the Turkish Cypriot Republican 
Assembly. 
  Denktas said that he told President Demirel of the 
difficulties, that a great injustice is being done to the 
Turkish Cypriot side, and that the problem cannot be resolved in 
this way. He added: We are ready to hold negotiations that 
will eliminate this injustice and the imbalances. 
  Replying to a question on the issue of Maras [Varosha], 
Denktas stressed that for the Turkish Cypriot side to accept the 
second map, which has certain additions, it must be given 
something in return. He pointed out that the issue is whether or 
not the Turkish Cypriots will benefit from the agreement in the 
way the Greek Cypriots will. 
  President Demirel, in turn, said that the economic problems 
of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and its political 
problems with the United Nations will be overcome.
