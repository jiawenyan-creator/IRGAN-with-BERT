  [Text] The Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] opened 
its special congress in Maringue yesterday. That congress will 
draw up Renamo's electoral strategy, including the electoral 
campaign and choice of candidates in the presidential and 
legislative elections scheduled to be held in October of this 
year. 
  Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama has disclosed that the 
delegates to the congress will also discuss Renamo's 
transformation from a political and military movement to a 
political party. In his opening speech, Dhlakama warned 
Renamo's members to be ready to face alleged provocative 
behavior by the Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo. 
Elaborating on such alleged provocative behavior, Dhlakama said 
that Renamo supporters have had their membership cards forcibly 
removed and children of Renamo members have been expelled from 
schools.
