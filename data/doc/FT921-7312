FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Cranbrook loses Pounds 3m of orders
Cranbrook Electronic Holdings was unable to make many inroads into its
losses in the year ended September 30. They amounted to Pounds 653,000,
after reorganisation costs of Pounds 197,000, against Pounds 696,000.
The group, a USM-traded distributor of high technology electronic components
and sub-systems, saw its turnover drop Pounds 3.08m to Pounds 7.41m as
principal customers cut production and reduced their stocks.
Some important suppliers were not prepared to respond to aggressive pricing.
That, said Mr Tony Diamond, chairman, resulted in a loss of at least Pounds
3m of orders, which he was sure the group would have continued to enjoy if
competitive pricing had been available to it.
Losses per share were again 6.61p. No dividend is recommended; the last
payment was an 0.5p interim in 1988-89.
