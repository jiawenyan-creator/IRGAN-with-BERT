LUFTHANSA TO BEGIN FLIGHTS TO BERLIN 
West Germany's Lufthansa airline, barred since World War II from flying to 
Berlin, will start flights to the capital of a united Germany next month, 
taking over routes from Pan Am Corp. 
Deutsche Lufthansa AG announced Monday that it had reached agreement to begin 
scheduled flights from several West German cities to Tegel Airport in West 
Berlin on Oct. 28, using leased Pan Am Corp. aircraft. 
Pan Am, struggling to turn around its loss-making airline, said it would 
receive $150 million in the deal. 
The deal, backed by the U.S. and West German governments, will end one of the 
many Cold War anomalies imposed by the victorious Allies in Berlin. The United 
States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France had maintained the sole right to 
fly in Berlin's airspace since 1945, closing potentially lucrative routes to 
the West German carrier.
