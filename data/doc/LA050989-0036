MOSES PLANS TO COMPETE THROUGH 1992 
Two-time Olympic gold medalist Edwin Moses, holder of one of track and field's 
most impressive streaks, said Monday he plans to compete through the 1992 
Olympics at Barcelona. 
Moses, 33, won the 400-meter intermediate hurdles gold medal in the 1976 
Olympics at Montreal and the 1984 Games at Los Angeles. During one stretch, 
from 1978 through 1987, he won more than 100 races without losing. Danny Harris 
finally beat him in 1987 at Madrid. 
Moses, of Newport Beach, won the bronze medal in last year's Olympics at Seoul 
finishing behind Andre Phillips of the United States and Amadou Ba of Senegal. 
Speaking at the Southern California Track Writers' luncheon Monday, Moses said 
he plans to return to competition this summer and stay with it through 1992, 
when he hopes to win a third gold medal. 
Moses said he believes he can run faster than 47 seconds for the race. He set 
the world record of 47.02 in 1983.
