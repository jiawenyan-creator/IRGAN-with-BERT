FT  25 FEB 92 / Observer: PR Prod
Following hard on last week's totally blank press release from HM Treasury
comes the almost completely blank invitation to 'a private view of the
launch commercial for the new Volkswagen Golf'. The large white card is
empty save for a half-inch rectangle of tiny print and a VW logo.
On the other hand, Observer now receives so many invites to the launch of
this, that, and the other new advert, that a blank one is quite welcome.
Once upon a time new commercials were simply flung at the unsuspecting
public; now they have to be accompanied by fripperies - champagne,
cassettes, glossy brochures and other gimmicks - which once went with the
launch of something more than 30 seconds of TV time.
