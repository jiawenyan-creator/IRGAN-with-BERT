FT  02 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A cottage to let
I am considering letting a terraced cottage as shared accommodation. I am
told the Revenue does not regard property letting as a business, regardless
of how much time is actually spent in managing tenancies, maintenance etc.,
and will not allow expenses to be deducted before tax. Is this so?
The letting of property is not a trade (and, consequently, the generous
expenses rules of case I of schedule D do not apply), but expenses are
deductible under the rules of schedule A (unfurnished letting) or case VI of
schedule D (furnished letting).
It is possible to elect for income from furnished lettings to be assessed
partly under schedule A and partly under schedule D case VI, which can be
advantageous in some situations.
As a first step, ask your tax office for the free pamphlet IR87 (Income from
letting property). Then, since you will need a solicitor, try to find a firm
which can give you tax advice as well as preparing documentation for the
lettings etc.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
