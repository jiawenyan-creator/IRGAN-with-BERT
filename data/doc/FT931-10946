FT  05 FEB 93 / CBI says third of employers freeze pay
ABOUT one in three of employers introduced pay freezes in the final quarter
of last year, according to the Confederation of British Industry's latest
pay databank figures, David Goodhart writes.
Over the same period, which saw Britain's withdrawal from the European
exchange rate mechanism and a spate of large redundancy announcements, the
CBI recorded average manufacturing pay settlements at only 2.8 per cent.
Pay awards in the service sector in that quarter were 3.2 per cent.
Although some of the low awards in the final quarter of last year might have
been affected by the uncertainty following withdrawal from the ERM,
subsequent settlements do not suggest that the downward trend has ended.
The CBI figures say that manufacturers' productivity rose 3.9 per cent in
the second half of last year, while basic pay awards averaged 3.5 per cent.
