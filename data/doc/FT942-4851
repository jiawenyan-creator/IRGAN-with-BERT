FT  08 JUN 94 / US-Japan banking accord
The US and Japan agreed yesterday to include banking and other financial
services in negotiations to pry open Japanese markets to more American
goods, AP reports from Paris.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, said the trading partners also
decided to discuss ways to ensure the protection of copyrights, patents and
other intellectual property.
The new sectors will be part of so-called framework talks, which are aimed
at improving American access to Japan's tightly closed markets.
The two nations recently broke a three-month deadlock to get negotiations
going again.
The original sectors - still under negotiation - are cars and car parts,
medical equipment, telecommunications products and insurance.
Mr Kantor said negotiators held talks yesterday in Paris on financial
services but he had no report of the outcome.
There will also be talks on films and other audiovisual products.
