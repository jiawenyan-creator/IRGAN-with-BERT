  [Text] According to reports received from special sources, 
the chauvinistic Baghdad regime deployed a military division 
inside Karkuk on 18 and 19 March, fearing an explosion of 
popular outrage in the city, especially during the days 
commemorating the anniversary of the liberation of this beloved 
Kurdish city and the Nowruz celebrations. 
  In their patrols of the streets and alleys of Karkuk, the 
regime's discipline men stand fully prepared and [words 
indistinct] to suppress any popular move in the city. The 
regime troops also searched the shops of Kurds in the city and 
caused many troubles for their owners.
