FT  27 MAY 94 / Branson drops lottery demands
Mr Richard Branson last night dropped demands for the national lottery
franchise to be subject to judicial review, after a meeting with Mr Peter
Davis, director general of Oflot, the lottery controlling body.
Mr Branson had called for the review after his UK Lottery Foundation failed
to win the franchise in spite of pledging that every penny raised from the
event would be used for good causes with no profits for himself or his
partners.
