FT  24 MAR 94 / Spain remains impenitent over shared platform
Spain remained impenitent yesterday over its decision to share a platform
with the UK that threatens to delay the enlargement of the Union.
Foreign minister Mr Javier Solana said he held out 'scant hope' that there
would be a compromise over voting rights in the expanded Union when the EU
foreign ministers meet in Greece on Saturday.
He dismissed speculation that Spain, which has specific interests such as
the protection of Mediterreanean farm produce, would abandon the UK in what
has so far been a joint opposition to changes in the EU's current blocking
vote rules.
The UK's policy, which has in the past been at odds with Spain's
characteristic Euro- enthusiasm, is viewed as a more blanket opposition to
the decision-making process in Brussels.
