FT  30 MAR 93 / Letter: Aggrieved at support by finance directors of ACT
changes
Sir, The chancellor has been given an excuse to bring back a surcharge on
dividend income in the guise of his Budget changes to the advance
corporation tax regime by a small group of self-serving finance directors
who have campaigned for changes in the ACT system. These directors, in
complaining about surplus advance corporation tax, have put their own
interests in building a larger power base ahead of their shareholders'
interests. They fail to recognise that any cost so incurred by the company
has always been a credit to the shareholder. Due to their campaigning, that
situation has ended and the chancellor is taking the opportunity to raise
substantial additional amounts of taxation from corporate shareholders.
I hope that the pension funds most aggrieved by this development will
exercise their substantial muscle in voting against the reappointment of any
finance director who has been a party to this campaign.
