FT  02 OCT 93 / Lib Dems win Tory council seats
CONSERVATIVES lost seats in five local-authority by-elections on Thursday in
a set of results which will intensify pressure on the party's leadership at
next week's annual conference.
Liberal Democrats gained from the Conservatives in five seats spread across
southern England: Debenham, Mid Suffolk; Belfairs, Southend; Heatherside,
Surrey Heath; Witham, West Lindsey; and St Peter's, Worcester. They also
gained one seat from an independent in Market Drayton, Shropshire.
Even in the one seat successfully defended by the Conservatives, in
Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, there was a swing of more than 30 per cent to the
Liberal Democrats.
Dr Michael Thrasher, local election analyst for the Local Government
Chronicle, said the latest figures add to an alarming trend for the
Conservatives. In August the party endured its worst local election results
since surveys began in the early 1980s, and the results suggest the party's
showing is even poorer than when the Community Charge - or poll tax - was
introduced.
He said: 'The seats the Tories are now defending should be their bedrock
because they have not been lost in the May elections of the last few years,
when they have usually been hammered except in 1992. They did so badly,
particularly in 1990, that the Conservatives should actually be making net
gains in by-elections.'
During September, Municipal Journal reported a net loss of 11 local seats
for the Conservatives, while Labour gained a net two, and the Liberal
Democrats eight.
Municipal Journal found that Liberal Democrat votes were up an average of
16.3 per cent since 1992, and 8.8 per cent since 1991. There were also
swings to Labour, of 10.6 per cent since 1992, and 4.8 per cent since 1991.
Conservative Central Office admitted that the results were 'extremely
disappointing,' but added: 'They reflect a protest vote, yet offer little
comfort for Labour, even with all their publicity over the last week.'
