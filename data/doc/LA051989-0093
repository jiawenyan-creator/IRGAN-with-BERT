MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO 
Lainie Kazan has left the cast of CBS' fall series "The Incredible Teddy Z" 
after taping six episodes, Columbia Television and Kazan's publicist have 
confirmed. Kazan, who was cast as the mother of young Hollywood agent Teddy 
Zakalakis (John Cryer) in the series from producer Hugh Wilson, quit "because 
she did not like the way her character was being written," according to 
publicist Jim Dobson. "They wanted her to be an old woman, and she wanted to 
play someone younger, more vital." No replacement has been named; Columbia says 
it will re-shoot Kazan's scenes in the already-taped episodes.
