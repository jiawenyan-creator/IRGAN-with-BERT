FT  01 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Volkswagen
Yesterday's 2 per cent fall in Volkswagen's share price seems a relaxed
response to a DM1.25bn first quarter loss. Without a further breakdown the
bare loss is difficult to interpret. Mr Ferdinand Piech, the new chairman,
needs an atmosphere of crisis to force through change. Yet his comment that
VW should break even this year seems at odds with the warning of worse pain
to come.
The 30 per cent rise in the shares since December suggests the market is
convinced VW's problems are being addressed. The promise of up to 20,000 job
cuts this year is tougher than before. The hard-hitting procurement team
recruited from General Motors should rationalise VW's sprawling supply base.
But the traffic is not all one-way. Even allowing Mr Piech some licence,
selling cars in Germany will be tough this year and next. The devaluation of
the Italian lira has cost VW competitiveness in its second biggest market.
Its reputation as the top quality producer among European volume car
manufacturers no longer goes unchallenged.
