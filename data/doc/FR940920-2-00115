Applicant's Representations




1. Applicant, a Maryland corporation, is an open-end management investment company. On February 21, 1990, applicant
filed a notification of registration pursuant to section 8(a) and a registration statement on Form N1A pursuant
to section 8(b) of the Act. On that same date, applicant filed a registration statement pursuant to the Securities
Act of 1933 registering an indefinite number of shares of beneficial interest. Applicant's registration statement
became effective on May 30, 1990 and its initial public offering commenced shortly thereafter.

2. At meetings on January 29, March 17 and June 24, 1993, applicant's board of directors approved a plan of reorganization,
termination and deregistration of applicant (the ``Reorganization''). Under the Reorganization, applicant would
be converted from a stand-alone structure to a master-feeder, series structure. As stated in the resolutions of the
board of directors attached at exhibit E to the application, applicant's board determined that the Reorganization
was in the best interests of applicant, and the interests of the existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result.

3. Proxy materials relating to the Reorganization were furnished to applicant's shareholders on or about April 29,
1993, and were filed with the SEC on May 5, 1993. At a meeting held on June 18, 1993, a majority of applicant's shareholders
approved the Reorganization.

4. On October 3, 1993, pursuant to the Reorganization, the Non-U.S. Equity Portfolio (the ``Master Fund'') acquired
all the investable assets and certain liabilities of applicant in exchange for a beneficial interest in the Master
Fund. On October 3, 1993, all the applicant's assets, consisting substantially of a beneficial interest in the Master
Fund, were transferred to The Pierpont International Fund series (the ``Successor Fund'') of the Pierpont Funds
(an open-end investment company) and the Successor Fund assumed all the applicant's liabilities in return for shares
of the Successor Fund. These shares of the Successor Fund were distributed tax-free on a share for share basis to applicant's
shareholders. Applicant's shareholders received shares of the Successor Fund with an aggregate net asset value
equal to the aggregate net asset value of their respective interests in applicant.

5. In connection with the reorganization, applicant incurred legal, accounting, proxy solicitation, shareholder
mailing, deregistration and other expenses, all of which were paid by applicant's investment adviser, Morgan Guaranty
Trust Company of New York.

6. Applicant has no outstanding debts or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative
proceeding. Applicant has no shareholders and is not engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities
other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs. Applicant will apply to be terminated under Maryland
law.
