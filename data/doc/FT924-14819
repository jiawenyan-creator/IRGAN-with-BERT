FT  08 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Australia power plant problem
A proposed ADollars 2bn (Pounds 800m) private power station in Western
Australia is in jeopardy after the state government indicated it would not
accept electricity prices proposed by Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the
Swiss/Swedish engineering group, Kevin Brown reports from Sydney.
ABB was commissioned in June by the West Australia State Energy Commission
(SEC) to build and run Australia's first privately-owned and
privately-funded power station at Collie, in the south-west of the state.
But the project depends on final agreement between ABB and the SEC on
several issues, including pricing and government financial support for
associated debt.
Mrs Carmen Lawrence, Labor premier, has told the SEC the government would
reject any contract with ABB raising energy prices or expose the state to
commercial risk. ABB plans to finance the project largely through a bonds
issue, but ABB has sought state guarantees for some of the proposed debt.
