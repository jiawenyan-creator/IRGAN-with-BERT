FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Gain for Canadian energy groups
Two Canadian energy groups have reported big gains in 1993 profits and are
stepping up capital spending this year.
Westcoast Energy is western Canada's top producer of natural gas and takes
in Union Gas, an Ontario gas distributor, acquired late in 1992.
Its 1993 net profit was CDollars 158m (USDollars 117m) or CDollars 1.82 a
share, against a 1992 loss of CDollars 64m or CDollars 1.31 after a CDollars
161m special charge. Revenues doubled to CDollars 3.6bn.
Fourth-quarter profit was CDollars 56m or 64 cents, compared with a loss of
CDollars 111m or CDollars 1.97 on revenues of CDollars 1.1bn, up 36 per
cent.
The 1993 results included Union Gas. The company plans to spend CDollars
900m this year to expand its utility operations, well up from last year.
Alberta Energy, one of western Canada's 10 biggest oil and gas producers,
had 1993 net profit of CDollars 91.6m or CDollars 1.23, up 117 per cent from
CDollars 42.2m or 53 cents a share in 1992, on net revenues of CDollars
626m, up 10 per cent.
Production and sales in its gas, oil and pipeline operations set new
records.
