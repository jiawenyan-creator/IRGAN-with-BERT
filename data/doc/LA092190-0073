CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
FRESNO; 
DOCTORS BACK OFF SURGERY FOR BOY 
It now appears that the parents of a 6-year-old Hmong boy will not be pressured 
into having court-ordered surgery to correct his club feet and a congenitally 
defective hip after all. State and federal judges have said that Kou Xiong 
should have the surgery over the objections of his parents because the 
afflictions will leave him a cripple for life if not corrected. 
However, Fresno County Social Services officials said that, despite a court 
order for the surgery, they have been unable to find a doctor willing to 
perform the operations without the parents' cooperation. Kou's parents went to 
court to keep the county from forcing the restoration operations. They 
contended that their religious beliefs hold that their son's feet were 
misshapen because God made them that way to atone for an ancestor's sins.
