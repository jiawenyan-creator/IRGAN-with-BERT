FT  14 SEP 94 / Bupa extends healthcare products
Bupa, the UK's biggest private health insurer, is making its expected move
into the long-term health-related insurance market.
The main element of its new product range is permanent health insurance  -
providing a replacement income if a policyholder cannot work because of
ill-health - extended to cover long-term care in old age.
Both areas are expected to see strong growth in demand as government changes
in the welfare system increase the need to insure privately.
Sales of permanent health insurance are expected to be boosted by the
introduction of an incapacity benefit next April. This will have tighter
definitions of inability to work and will pay smaller amounts to some of
those who qualify for benefit.
The move will take advantage of the strength of Bupa's name in the field of
health-related insurance.
Research has found that when potential buyers of permanent health or
long-term care insurance were asked which company they would expect to buy
it from, Bupa was often mentioned even though it did not offer that type of
product.
PPP, Bupa's smaller rival with 28 per cent of the private medical insurance
market, has already set up a subsidiary to provide long-term care and
permanent health insurance.
