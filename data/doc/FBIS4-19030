  [Text] Strasbourg, April 13 (AFP) -- Palestine Liberation 
Organisation leader Yasir 'Arafat arrived here Wednesday [13 
April] to give a speech to the Parliamentary Assembly of the 
Council of Europe. 
  The PLO chairman was scheduled to hold a press conference in 
the afternoon. 
  Arafat has already visited Strasbourg last December when he 
addressed the European Parliament. 
  His visit coincides with the day that should have marked the 
Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of 
Jericho, a date which has since been pushed back to the first 
half of May at the earliest.
