SUPREME COURT STRIKES DOWN LAW AGAINST FLAG BURNING 
Instead of amending the Constitution to make it illegal to burn or otherwise 
desecrate the flag, I suggest enacting a law that would equate such desecration 
with a voluntary renunciation of the perpetrator's U.S. citizenship. Those 
individuals who choose to show such disrespect for our country's flag would 
then no longer enjoy the benefits of citizenship, such as protection from 
prosecution for acts of vandalism by appealing to the First Amendment. 
Couldn't these non-citizens then be subject to deportation to a country whose 
flag is more to their liking?
