  [Text] The National Socialist Party of Russia held its 
founding conference in Novosibirsk. This was initiated by the 
local branch of the movement called Russian National Unity. As 
Interfax learned from its leader, Yuriy Garov, the National 
Socialist Party intends to work to improve the political and 
economic situation in Russia. 
  According to Garov, unlike Zhirinovskiy and Zyuganov, the 
national socialists can stabilize the country's economy in a 
year, "by using the 1933 experience of German national 
socialists aimed at improving the nation's genetic fund." 
  As Garov said, in its political program his party intends to 
demand that early presidential elections be held and that the 
government and other executive authorities resign. 
  However, Garov pointed out, the resignation of government 
and 
president must not be gained with the help of terrorist acts. 
When asked by Interfax's correspondent about the participation 
of Aleksandr Barkashov in the work of the founding conference, 
Garov said that the leader of Russian National Unity had failed 
to come to Novosibirsk because he was ill, and because his 
movement did not want to put his life at risk. 
  According to preliminary information, representatives from 
14 
Russian cities attended the conference.
