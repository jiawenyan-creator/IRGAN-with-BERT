CHUNKS OF BRIDGE FALL ONTO CARS 
Chunks of concrete plummeted from a bridge onto an interstate highway 75 feet 
below Sunday, damaging at least 20 vehicles and injuring three motorists. 
"A rock came out of the sky, bounced off our hood and smashed the windshield," 
said motorist Laura Nizankiewicz. 
"There was glass all over the car. My sister got a piece in her eye, and our 
arms were covered with little slivers." 
State Trooper W. Hughes said 20 vehicles received damage to hoods, roofs, 
windshields and bumpers as they passed on Interstate 376 under the city-owned 
bridge about 3:30 p.m. 
At least three people were injured, Hughes said. Two people were treated at the 
scene, and one woman was in stable condition at Presbyterian-University 
Hospital in Pittsburgh, he said. 
Al Neri, a spokesman for Mayor Sophie Masloff, said late Sunday city engineers 
weren't sure if the debris fell from the bridge or from collection nets placed 
under the span during the weekend.
