DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN PLEADS GUILTY TO KILLING BOYFRIEND 
A 29-year-old Encino woman pleaded guilty Tuesday to second-degree murder in 
the strangling of her 68-year-old boyfriend during an argument about the 
woman's female lover. 
Adele Kathy Rodriguez earlier admitted strangling Stanley Wittman with a strap 
from a pair of overalls, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth A. Loveman. Wittman's 
decomposed body was found on Sept. 15, 1988, by the building manager in the 
couple's Encino apartment in the 5400 block of Newcastle Avenue. 
The couple had been arguing about Rodriguez's female lover, Nancy Ortiz, at the 
time of the slaying, Loveman said. 
A week after the killing, police discovered Ortiz driving the victim's 1985 
Oldsmobile Cutlass when she was stopped for a traffic violation. Ortiz told 
police that Rodriguez had admitted to her that she killed Wittman. Rodriguez 
was arrested a short time later, authorities said. 
The defendant originally pleaded not guilty to one count of murder. However, 
that charge was dropped in exchange for her plea to the lesser charge, 
authorities said. 
Rodriguez, on parole for a felony burglary conviction at the time of the 
slaying, remains in custody without bail and is scheduled to return to court on 
June 20 for sentencing. She faces a maximum sentence of 15 years to life in 
prison.
