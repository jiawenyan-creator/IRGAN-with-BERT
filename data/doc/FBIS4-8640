  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG)--David Owen, cochairman of 
the Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, told journalists this 
evening before his talks with Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic that NATO air attacks near Gorazde were justified, 
basing his explanation on UN Security Council resolutions. 
  He categorically rejected claims that the United Nations had 
placed itself on the side of the Muslims, stressing that it was 
now most important to restore the peace process and resume 
dialogue between the sides in the conflict.
