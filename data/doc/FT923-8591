FT  11 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Vodafone
Following Cellnet's lead, Vodafone is about to announce an alternative set
of tariffs for users of cellular phones. The new charges will be similar on
both networks and emphasise lower line rentals but higher peak call rates.
The change is being marketed as an attempt to bring cellular to a wider
range of occasional users, but carries risks. Vodafone and Cellnet have both
made the nice calculation that they can increase revenues from new
subscribers by more than they lose as a result of existing users
transferring to the cheaper tariff. In Vodafone's own estimate it will be
close. Others are not so generous.
All concede that it will mean lower revenues than would have been expected
for the next couple of years. Existing subscribers who move will transfer in
the next few months; new customers may be slower in coming. This may not
amount to a price war but it is hardly the brave new world where marketing
hype projected cellular revenues growing geometrically forever.
One reason for the tariff changes is that the cellular world is about to get
more complicated. Next year new digital and personal communication networks
are due to be launched, which the backers hope will bring cellular to the
mass market. New tariffs are one way of keeping conventional cellular
competitive. But in the wait for a mass market, such keen competition smells
of slowing growth.
The wider question is whether the mass market will arrive. Cellular has
proved itself a useful business product with a finite constituency. Whether
individuals need or even want millions of mobile phones remains to be
proved. Judging by its steady erosion of Vodafone's price earnings ratio,
the market has yet to be convinced that the cellular growth trick can be
turned twice.
