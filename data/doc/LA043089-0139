NEW STYLES OF ELECTRICAL PLUGS ARE SAFER 
You can increase your safety and protect your appliances from abuse by 
replacing old and worn electrical plugs and receptacles with newer styles 
offering extra safety features and conveniences. 
Maintenance Technology magazine says that to secure a plug that might be easily 
knocked out of the receptacle, a straight-blade plug with a locking screw can 
be used. This type of connection is especially important for appliances such as 
refrigerators, where the result of an accidental disconnection can mean real 
trouble. 
An angle plug should be used when you want to place furniture or an appliance 
closer to the wall. An angle plug lays flat against the wall instead of 
protruding from it. As for receptacles, isolated ground receptacles should be 
used whenever sensitive electrical equipment such as computers require a pure, 
noise-free ground. Surge suppression receptacles help protect electronic 
equipment from damage caused by transient voltage spikes.
