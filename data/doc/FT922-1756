FT  20 JUN 92 / Markets: Profits pale for pharmaceuticals - At A Glance
The UK no longer wants to take its medicine, judging by the recent
performance of pharmaceuticals stocks. They outperformed the market strongly
last year, buoyed by the belief that they had strong defensive qualities in
times of uncertainty, but since the election they have underperformed
greatly, as sectors perceived as vulnerable to political risk have
recovered. This week, shares in companies such as Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham
and Wellcome were depressed by a profits warning from Upjohn, the US
pharmaceutical group.
