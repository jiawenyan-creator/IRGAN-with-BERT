FT  30 MAR 93 / Opposition leader's sentence cut
Malawi's Supreme Court yesterday reduced the prison sentence of opposition
leader Chakufwa Chihana from two years to nine months, enraging the
opposition that had hoped he would be freed, Reuter reports from
Johannesburg.
An opposition official repeated allegations that prison guards were forcing
Chihana to work as a labourer despite his poor health. Mr Chihana, 52, is a
leading trade unionist and opposition campaigner.
