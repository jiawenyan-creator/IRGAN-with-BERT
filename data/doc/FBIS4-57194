  [Text] Supreme Court President Mauricio Gutierrez Castro 
has criticized the various organizations and individuals who, 
under the pretext of foreign aid and the peace agreements, are 
pushing for the ratification of constitutional reforms. 
Yesterday, Gutierrez Castro said some reforms have been approved 
"not because Salvadorans agree with them but because the UN 
secretary general has expressed his concern." 
  "We must be a sovereign nation and find a way to become 
financially independent to keep others from trying to manipulate 
us under the guise of international aid. "Anyone with 
light-blue eyes feels entitled to recommend reforms here," 
Gutierrez noted. "We must stop being cowards because cowards 
are always intimidated. As long as we continue to lack moral 
courage and a high concept of our nationality, we will have to 
live under pressure." 
  Asked about President-elect Armando Calderon Sol's trip to 
the United Nations, where he will reportedly reiterate his 
government's commitment to comply with the peace agreements, 
Gutierrez Castro said that he himself could not raise political 
criticisms against Calderon Sol. He added, however, that it 
would be ruinous for Calderon Sol to commit to compliance with 
recommendations made in the Truth Commission report because they 
"are illegal, arbitrary, and deceitful." Gutierrez Castro 
asserted that "if I had to go to the United Nations, I would go, 
but I would not say that I am going to comply with those 
recommendations." 
  On 11 May, Gutierrez Castro presided over the inauguration 
ceremony of the First Specialized Regional Seminar for Lawyers, 
Judges, and Military Judge Advocates: Human Rights in the Armed 
Forces. The event was held at the Camino Real Hotel and 
sponsored by the Inter-American Human Rights Institute's Program 
for the Armed Forces and Police, the Spanish Defense Ministry, 
and the Salvadoran Defense Ministry. 
  Political analyst Kirio Waldo Salgado said the Legislative 
Assembly must avoid foreign pressure. "We are tired of dealing 
with unfair constitutional measures on the last day of 
congressional sessions," he stated. Salgado said that 
"democracy in El Salvador is subject to the U.S. Government, 
which dictates reforms in this country." He added that the 
deputies must legislate on behalf of the Salvadoran people, not 
for the international order.
