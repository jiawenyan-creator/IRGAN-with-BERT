FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Caverdale incurs Pounds 272,000 deficit
Caverdale, the motor and engineering trade consumables group, yesterday
announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 272,000 for the six months to end-June.
This compares with profits of Pounds 247,000 for the comparable period last
year and with losses of Pounds 305,000 at the December year end.
The pre-tax figure was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 112,000
(Pounds 332,000 gain) relating to the costs of an abortive acquisition.
Turnover fell 13 per cent to Pounds 4.77m and losses per share were 0.31p
(earnings 1.87p).
