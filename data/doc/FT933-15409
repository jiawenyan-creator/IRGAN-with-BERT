FT  09 JUL 93 / Spanish Prime Minister promises change
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime minister, wins a round of applause from
colleagues in parliament following a speech yesterday promising a policy of
deregulation and decentralisation during his fourth term. He said he
expected members of the Catalan and the Basque nationalist parties to join
his Socialist-led cabinet. Many of the policies outlined by Mr Gonzalez in
his speech bore the mark of Mr Carlos Solchaga, the liberal-minded economy
minister in the outgoing government. He fought bitter battles to contain
public spending and to loosen Spain's rigid labour laws.
