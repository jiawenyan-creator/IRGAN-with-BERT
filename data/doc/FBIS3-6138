  [Text] Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitingan 
has denied reports that he is stepping down following the 
political crisis he is now facing. In a statement issued to 
reporters in Kota Kinabalu this evening, he said he has no 
intention to resign as chief minister so long as his services 
are needed by the people. The statement was released by (Lucy 
Yong), press secretary of the chief minister, at the Sri Gaya 
official residence at about 1945 this evening. 
  The statement followed a report that Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan, 
Pairin's younger brother and an assemblyman from Bingkor, had 
announced Pairin's offer to step down to avoid a political 
crisis. Dr. Jeffrey was also reported that he would inform the 
prime minister about the offer in Kuala Lumpur this evening.
