<F P=106> [Interview with Government Minister Fabio Villegas by </F>
Ricardo Canon at the Presidential Palace in Santa Fe de Bogota; 
from the "Midday Television Newscast" -- live] 
  [Text] [Canon] A ceremony has just concluded here at the 
Presidential Palace -- a ceremony in which President Cesar 
Gaviria ratified the Statutory Law on Exceptional Conditions, 
which makes it possible for the government to deal with certain 
unusual situations. Here is Government Minister Fabio Villegas. 
Mr. Minister, looking into the future, what does this law mean 
for upcoming administrations? 
  [Villegas] For the first time in the history of the nation, 
the nature of the special powers available to the executive in 
times of crisis has been spelled out. There is now a balance 
between state powers in restoring normalcy and successfully 
dealing with these situations and the respect for the rights of 
all Colombians. 
  [Canon] Does this mean that the state of exceptional 
measures, which was used before this law was enacted, has been 
rendered obsolete? 
  [Villegas] The state of exceptional measures, at least as we 
knew it in the past, has disappeared from the country's life and 
juridical order. We now have the power to handle crises and to 
preserve social peace, but with controls and limitations clearly 
established by this new law.
