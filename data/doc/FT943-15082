FT  12 JUL 94 / World Trade News: US seeks to curb EU aircraft moves
The US aerospace industry is seeking to insert into the Uruguay Round
implementing legislation, now being written in Congress, language which
would head off European Union efforts to curb indirect aircraft subsidies.
The industry has also expressed concern that a proposed 600-seat Airbus
airliner will require direct government support which would breach limits in
a US-EU bilateral agreement.
The Aerospace Industries Association has told Mr Mickey Kantor, President
Clinton's trade representative, that if the limits are exceeded, the US
should reinstate its complaint against Airbus in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
Such a move would be regarded as highly provocative in Brussels, which is
increasingly angered by US refusals to negotiate curbs on indirect support
in the Gatt.
The EU claims that the US industry benefits substantially from such
assistance, in the form of research and development contracts granted by the
Pentagon. The EU is also unhappy about aid to the industry by the US
National Aeronautics and Space Association.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, has promised not to negotiate
new disciplines which would be 'unacceptable' to the US industry, but the
AIA still hopes to get the policy enshrined into law.
In a proposed draft of language for the Uruguay Round implementing
legislation, the AIA calls for 'rejection of any new disciplines on indirect
supports for civil aircraft which are different or apart from those that
would apply to all industries.' The only exception would be limits agreed in
the 1992 US-EU agreement 'solely with respect to large civil aircraft.'
The US and EU agreed to 'multilateralise' the agreement but talks last week
made little progress, and the negotiators will not meet again until
September.
The bilateral pact has some limits on indirect supports and limits direct
supports to Airbus to 33 per cent of programme cost.
