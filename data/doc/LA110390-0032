IVANA TRUMP WILL FILE FOR DIVORCE 
The long-anticipated Trump divorce became more than just gossip when Ivana 
Trump's lawyer announced that, "with deep regret," she was filing for a divorce 
from her developer husband, Donald. 
It wasn't clear when the papers would be filed. The couple separated in 
February amid a flurry of publicity over Donald Trump's relationship with 
model-actress Marla Maples. "Mrs. Trump and I have discussed our situation and 
have mutually agreed that it would be appropriate for her to file for divorce," 
Trump said in a statement. The Trumps married 13 years ago and have three 
children.
