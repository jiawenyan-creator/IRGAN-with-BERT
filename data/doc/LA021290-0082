MARKET BEAT: MARKET WATCH; 
LITTLE GUY PLAYED BIG ROLE 
Faster than you can clip a bond coupon, the terror over rising interest rates 
has suddenly subsided. You can thank a lot of small investors -- and hope 
they're right in their judgment. 
Last week's $30-billion Treasury financing went far more smoothly than Wall 
Street expected, mainly because individual investors were elated at the idea of 
getting 8.4% to 8.6% yields on Uncle Sam's 3-year, 10-year and 30-year notes 
and bonds. And there's a lesson in that for the future. 
How hungry were investors? Bond trader Charles Ovis at Bateman Eichler, Hill 
Richards in Los Angeles says he saw "very good demand from mom-and-pop 
accounts" for the 3-year and 10-year securities. At A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons, a 
St. Louis-based brokerage that is a big name throughout the nation's heartland, 
bond trader James Hodapp says he saw "much more demand by individuals than at 
any time since last spring." 
Although many analysts had worried that the government would have to pay 
sharply higher rates to sell its notes and bonds, the run-up in rates that had 
taken place in January turned out to be enough. And the euphoria carried into 
Friday, when buyers continued to pour into the Treasury market, fueling a 
tremendous rally. While the government sold its 30-year bonds at an average 
yield of 8.50% on Thursday, by Friday the demand for the bonds was so strong 
that the yield had tumbled to 8.33%. 
Clearly, analysts had been overly preoccupied with whether Japanese buyers 
would bid for the securities. The experts overlooked the American investor's 
point of view: Rates on short-term investments, such as money market funds, are 
no longer very attractive; high-yield junk bonds have become Untouchables, and 
the stock market looks too risky. That leaves few options for your money. 
Six months ago, the average money market mutual fund yield was 8.33%. The yield 
on 30-year T-bonds was 8.05%. So who needed long-term bonds then? Now, the 
average yield is just 7.66%. So 8.50% on a long-term bond is a big incentive to 
invest. 
Long-term interest rates in the United States jumped in January largely because 
rates in West Germany and Japan had jumped. Many analysts worry that German and 
Japanese rates will head even higher soon, given the booming economies of those 
nations. The fear is that long-term rates here will follow. But the Treasury 
auction suggests that any rise in rates would quickly bring out a herd of bond 
buyers and that rates here wouldn't stay up for long. If so, that would be good 
news for the housing market, the stock market and the economy in general. Stay 
tuned.

Sutro's Challenge to Brokers: The misfortunes of the nation's major New 
York-based brokerages create great opportunities for regional firms in Los 
Angeles and elsewhere in the 1990s, says Lloyd Greif, vice chairman of Sutro 
&amp; Co. In fact, Greif told a conference of regional brokerage executives in 
San Francisco last week that the decade is theirs to grab. 
"The 1980s clearly belonged to the national securities firms because they were 
the ones that put together the mega-mergers, the billion-dollar-plus hostile 
takeovers," said Greif, who runs Sutro's corporate finance arm from Los 
Angeles. "These major transactions will be fewer and farther between in the 
1990s. . . . But the middle-market deals, those of $250 million and less, are 
continuing to get done," Greif said, because they don't require the junk bond 
financing that big deals required. While most mega-deals were engineered in New 
York, middle-market deals tend to originate outside New York, on regional 
brokerages' turf, Greif said. And Los Angeles, he said, "is the middle-market 
capital of the U.S., if not the world." 
Greif isn't talking about hostile takeovers when he uses the word "deal." Most 
middle-market corporate deals are cases of smaller firms making friendly 
purchases of others; family-owned firms that have opted to sell, or 
entrepreneurs looking for financing. Despite the generally sorry state of the 
brokerage business, Sutro's backlog of work in those deal areas is bigger than 
at any time in the '80s, Greif said. "We're hiring," he said. 
To keep clients happy in the 1990s -- and to lure new clients -- Greif said 
regional brokerages have to think bigger. In particular, he said, regional 
firms have to think internationally, because that's the way smart corporate 
clients and individual investors will be thinking. And he also warned that 
"California (brokerages) can't focus just on the Pacific Rim, and East Coast 
firms can't concentrate only on Europe. Firms must look at the market on a 
global basis."

market, Smith Barney, Harris Upham tells clients to refocus on the basics. 
"Look for companies and industries that are likely to have pricing power in the 
1990s." That means industries where capacity is tight, even in this slow 
economy. "Natural gas producers are an example," the brokerage says.
