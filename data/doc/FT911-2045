FT  02 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Few jobs in equality training
EQUAL opportunities training may do more for an organisation's image than it
does for increasing job prospects for women, black people or the disabled,
according to a survey of organisations employing more than 2m people.
Almost all of the 131 private and public-sector organisations questioned by
Industrial Relations Services, a research group, thought that
equal-opportunities training for staff had improved recruitment and
selection procedures.
However, when it came to training's effect on the job opportunities of
various groups, only 28 per cent reported an improvement in the
representation of disabled people; 38 per cent in that of ethnic minorities
and 49 per cent in the case of women.
The second highest-rated effect was in obtaining support from key staff for
equal opportunities.
Nearly 90 per cent said the training had made some improvement. 'A better
image for the company' was the third highest-rated benefit.
The course most commonly offered by organisations was designed for those
involved in recruiting staff. The study said that typically, such courses
covered the legislation on equal opportunities, drawing up objective
selection criteria and interviewing.
Overall, the proportion of organisations offering equal opportunities
training was higher in the public than the private sector - a figure of 85
per cent against 71 per cent.
