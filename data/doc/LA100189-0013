CURRENT PAPERBACKS: BINGO BY RITA MAE BROWN (BANTAM: $4.95) 
In "Bingo," Rita Mae Brown uses the pleasures of small-town life to explore the 
need to belong -- to a family and a community. Nichole (Nickel) Smith, the 
lesbian ace journalist of the Runnymede Clarion, finds herself drawn into the 
conflict between the depersonalized world of corporate acquisitions and local 
control of affairs when the owner of the newspaper decides to sell it and 
retire. 
Brown's Runnymede, an antebellum town that straddles the Mason-Dixon Line, is 
as richly improbable as Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon. Among its more notable 
inhabitants are Nichole's adoptive mother, Julia Hunsenmeir, and her sister, 
Louise. These fractious octogenarians have been quarreling for so long -- and 
have gotten so good at it -- that their spats have become a spectator sport in 
Runnymede. "Bingo" blends honest sentiment with a sassy irreverence, but avoids 
both mawkishness and flip vulgarity.
