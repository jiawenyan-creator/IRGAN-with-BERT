PANEL BACKS PERKINS TO HEAD FOREIGN SERVICE 
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday endorsed the nomination of 
Edward J. Perkins, the U.S. ambassador to South Africa, to be director general 
of the U.S. Foreign Service. If approved by the full Senate, Perkins, 61, will 
become the highest-ranking black diplomat in the history of the State 
Department.
