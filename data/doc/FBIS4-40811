Today, Tomorrow" column: "Another Failure To Consider Russia"] 
  [Text] Eminent U.S. political scientist Robert Manning, 
who took part in drafting the Clinton administration's policy 
toward the DPRK, has advocated "closer" coordination of actions 
between the United States and Russia in settling the nuclear 
problem of North Korea. 
  "I am critical of the fact that the U.S. Administration has 
failed to consult more closely with Russia on the subject of the 
North Korean problem," he stated in an interview with an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent. "Russia does not want nuclear weapons 
on the Korean peninsula, nor does it want war to break out as a 
result of the collapse of the North Korean regime." 
  The expert criticized the aims which the U.S. Administration 
is pursuing in respect of North Korea. In his view, the 
application of sanctions prior to presenting the North Koreans 
with a clearly crafted package of specific proposals would be a 
mistake.
