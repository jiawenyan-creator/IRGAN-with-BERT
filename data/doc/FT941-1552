FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Jardine Matheson lifts profits
by 23% to Dollars 389m
Jardine Matheson, one of Hong Kong's oldest trading conglomerates, yesterday
attempted to deflect attention away from its planned de-listing from Hong
Kong to its 23 per cent rise in net profits to USDollars 388.8m last year,
up from Dollars 316.8m in 1992.
Mr Charles Powell, director, said yesterday: 'Jardines will be judged not by
where it is listed but by its results, and the results announced today are
excellent.'
Analysts fought shy of the term 'excellent', saying the results, while
strong, were broadly in line with expectations.
Earnings were lifted by a strong performance at Jardine Fleming, the Hong
Kong merchant banking joint venture between Jardine Matheson and Robert
Fleming, the UK merchant bank.
On Tuesday, Jardine Fleming reported a 166 per cent leap in net profits to
USDollars 202m, half of which accrues to Jardine Matheson.
Jardine Fleming contributed a 26 per cent slice of total net profits,
compared with 12 per cent in 1992. Conversely, the contribution from Jardine
Pacific, the trading and services arm, slumped to 42 per cent from 50 per
cent the previous year.
Mr Nigel Rich, managing director, attributed the fall to poor results from
Japan and a disappointing performance on the shipping side.
Geographically, the biggest upturn came from south-east Asia, where net
profits rose to Dollars 57.2m from Dollars 21.5m the previous year. Earnings
from Hong Kong and China improved at a much more modest rate, up to Dollars
224.3m from Dollars 207.2m.
Mr Henry Keswick, chairman, said: 'Jardine Matheson's particular strength is
in the Asia-Pacific region, which remains the world's prime growth area, but
the group also has extensive investments elsewhere, which hold promise for
the future.'
Total turnover climbed by 7 per cent to Dollars 84bn, from Dollars 7.9bn the
previous year. Fully diluted earnings per share rose by 21 per cent to 66.31
cents from 54.59 cents. Net asset value per share increased by 34 per cent
to Dollars 4.66.
The directors will recommend a dividend of 15.20 cents per share which gives
a total payout of 22 cents. This represents an increase over 1992 of 18 per
cent.
