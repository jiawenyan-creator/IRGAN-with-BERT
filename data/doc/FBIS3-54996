  [Text] Public statements by Tbilisi police chief David 
Zeikidze who said that a few hundred Russian servicemen would be 
sufficient for the effective implementation of the state of 
emergency regime in the Georgian capital -- just as this had 
been the case in the Black Sea port of Poti -- were today 
unexpectedly transformed into rumors embroidered with improbable 
details. 
  Thus it was claimed that in the past 24 hours crack subunits 
of the Feliks Dzerzhinskiy Moscow Division of Russia's Internal 
Affairs troops had landed at the airport in the Tbilisi suburb 
of Vaziani and that as early as tomorrow they would, together 
with the republic's law enforcement bodies, start jointly 
patrolling the Georgian capital. 
  Representatives of the command of the Russian force in the 
Transcausus, the press secretariat of the head of the Georgian 
State, and the press secretariat of the republic's competent 
bodies flatly denied this latest piece of news.
