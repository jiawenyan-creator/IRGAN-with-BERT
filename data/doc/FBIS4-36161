  [Text] Cairo, 6 Jun (MENA) -- Ahmad Muhammad Luqman, 
permanent representative of the Republic of Yemen to the Arab 
League, has denied news agency reports that warplanes bombed 
storage tanks in the Aden oil refinery in south Yemen. 
  In a statement made today, the Yemeni ambassador said such 
an 
attack is not part of Sanaa's military strategy. He explained 
that since the outbreak of war, Sanaa has been eager to keep all 
vital and civilian installations in the southern governorates 
away from military operations.
