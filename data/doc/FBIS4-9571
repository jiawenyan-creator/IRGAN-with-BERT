  [Text] Our reporter at the National Assembly, Antoaneta 
Kuncheva, briefly summarizes what has happened so far at the 
National Assembly session, including the declaration on the 
government's intentions read by Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. 
  [Kuncheva] Prime Minister Berov kept his promise and 
addressed the National Assembly. However, he did not present a 
draft of structural changes but instead read a declaration on 
the future intentions of the government. The declaration 
contained promises on updating the government's program and 
adopting measures aimed at stabilizing the country in the 
economic and social spheres, and also something that resembled 
an explanation of the need to effect changes in the posts of 
deputy prime ministers and in the leaderships of the Ministry of 
Defense and the Ministry of Trade. 
  An urgent meeting of the National Assembly Council is 
discussing at present whether it is admissible to open a 
parliamentary debate on the prime minister's declaration and 
whether this conforms to National Assembly regulations.
