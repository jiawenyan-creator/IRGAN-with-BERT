METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
POWER OUTAGE HITS DURING RUSH HOUR 
Most of Pasadena was without electricity for up to two hours Wednesday night 
during a power outage that apparently was caused by a faulty switch controlling 
a main high-voltage transmission line, police said. 
The outage affected about 80 percent of city residents and knocked out traffic 
lights through a large swath of the city at the height of rush hour. Police 
officers were stationed at major intersections to direct traffic. 
Police Sgt. Bruce A. Linsenmayer said police received scores of calls, but none 
amounted to anything serious. 
"No injuries, no traffic accidents, nothing -- and it happened right at prime 
time," he said. 
David C. Plumb, general manager of Pasadena's Water and Power Department, said 
the switch shut down a 230-kilovolt transmission line for just a few seconds. 
But the power loss caused a chain reaction that disrupted other power lines 
connected to the system. 
Plumb said the department is still unsure what caused the switching problem. 
Workers began restoring power soon after the lines shut down and had power back 
to all homes by 6:45 p.m. There are approximately 50,000 homes in the city.
