BRIEFLY 
Judge Throws Out Most of Suit: A Superior Court judge barred a former employee 
of Shuwa Investments Corp. from pursuing most allegations that two top 
executives beat and harassed him. Former Shuwa accountant Hajime Tanioka 
charged in an August, 1989, suit that President Takaji Kobayashi and Executive 
Vice President Takeshi Shiratori attacked him in 1987 and 1988. Judge Richard 
Lavine ruled that a one-year statute of limitations invalidated six of seven 
parts of the complaint.
