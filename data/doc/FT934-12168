FT  28 OCT 93 / Yeltsin signs land sale decree
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday signed an historic decree allowing the
free sale of land, in a move crucial to the reform of Russian agriculture,
writes Leyla Boulton from Moscow.
The decree lays the foundations for a mortgage system, enabling banks to
lend money to farmers using land as collateral, and sets out reforms to the
state and collective farms which still dominate Russia's ailing agricultural
sector.
