FT  13 APR 93 / GM challenges truck ruling
GENERAL Motors was preparing new evidence yesterday to present to the US
government about the safety of its 4.7m trucks built with side-mounted fuel
tanks. Federal safety authorities said last week that the trucks were unsafe
and should be recalled.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not order the trucks
to be recalled but asked the Transportation department to request a recall
based upon its preliminary analysis of the truck's design. However, GM has
chosen to respond immediately to the NHTSA's ruling, which if implemented,
could cost the company Dollars 1bn (Pounds 662m) and seriously damage its
image with consumers.
GM has until the end of the month to provide the NHTSA with new evidence
that its 1973-1987 model pickup trucks, built with twin 'side-saddle' fuel
tanks situated outside the vehicle's frame, are not unsafe.
After its preliminary inquiry, the NHTSA said the design made the truck more
prone to fire risk in side-impact collisions than similar models constructed
with the fuel tanks inside the frame. GM insists the trucks were built
within federal safety guidelines.
If GM fails to convince the NHTSA that the trucks are safe, the agency could
continue its investigation, hold public hearings, and seek a court order
forcing the company to recall the trucks.
Such an outcome would breathe fresh life into dozens of lawsuits already
filed against the company.
The latest development in the truck safety row comes at a difficult time for
GM, which is trying to rebound from heavy losses and shore up its declining
market share. News of the NHTSA's ruling unsettled investors yesterday,
depressing GM's share price by Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 38 7/8 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
