 

GK Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California (Registered Importer No. R90007) has
petitioned NHTSA to determine whether 1991 Mercedes-Benz 500SEL (Model ID 126.037) passenger cars are eligible
for importation into the United States. The vehicle which GK believes is substantially similar is the 1991 Mercedes-Benz
420SEL, which was manufactured for importation into, and sale in the United States, and certified by its manufacturer,
Daimler Benz A.G., as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
The petitioner contends that it carefully compared the 1991 model 500SEL to the 1991 model 420SEL, and found the two
vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.
GK submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the 1991 model 500SEL, as originally
manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as the 1991 model 420SEL,
or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the 1991 model 500SEL is identical to the 1991 model 420SEL with respect
to compliance with Standard Nos. 102
