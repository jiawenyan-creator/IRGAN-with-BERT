FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: BHF-Bank lifts profits to DM366m
BHF-BANK, the Frankfurt-based merchant bank, rounded off the reporting
season for Germany's larger banks by announcing 1992 group operating profits
up by 6.9 per cent to DM366m (Dollars 228m).
The increase is more modest than at Germany's bigger banks, most of which
have increased operating profits by more than 10 per cent. But at the
partial operating profits level, which excludes the contribution from
own-account trading, BHF's 1992 profits rose by 15.3 per cent to DM327m.
Mr Wolfgang Strutz, senior partner, said that provisions for bad and
doubtful debts had been increased significantly for 1992, mainly for
corporate loans.
The incidence of bad debts rose from 0.09 per cent of the total loan
portfolio in 1991 to 0.17 per cent last year, just above the 0.15 per cent
average of the last five years.
Total business volume rose 11.5 per cent last year to DM54bn, while the
surplus on interest income climbed 10.8 per cent to DM569m. Fee income
increased 13.3 per cent to DM301m while administrative expenses rose 9.6 per
cent to DM544m.
