FT  23 AUG 93 / Observer: Just kidding
Smith New Court obviously likes the sound of Chiltern Radio. The firm's
latest research on Chiltern, called 'The only way is up', carries the
immortal line 'the shares have fallen by over 100 per cent in the last year
and now look cheap'. Perhaps the offending analyst should follow the example
of Capital Radio's David Jensen, whose photo adorns the report, and seek
alternative work as a disc jockey. He would be guaranteed a better
reception.
