  [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- The removal of Nikolay 
Medvedev from the post of head of the presidential 
administration's department for work with regions was prompted 
by "mistakes in crucial directions," President Boris Yeltsin's 
Chief of Staff Sergey Filatov said. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Filatov said that 
"Nikolay Medvedev is strong in many fields, he is a serious 
analyst. However the preparation of a draft law on local 
self-government had practically failed in the last few months 
although the regional leaders were assured that the document 
would be submitted to the State Duma shortly. But real work on 
it is only beginning." 
  Filatov stressed that Medvedev had failed to establish close 
cooperation with the presidential representatives in Russian 
provinces. Additionally, the removal of Bryansk Region 
administration head Yuriy Lodkin had developed into a conflict 
which could have been avoided in order not to "discredit 
authorities in the eyes of the population," Filatov said. 
  He added that Medvedev's successor Aleksey Kazakov "knows 
the 
regions well owing to his work in the state property management 
committee."
