FT  19 APR 93 / Spain may be heading for hung parliament
SPAIN'S general election could produce a hung parliament on June 6,
according to the first opinion polls to be published since socialist Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez called a snap election a week ago, Tom Burns writes
from Madrid.
A poll by the Madrid newspaper El Mundo puts the centre-right opposition
People's Party(PP) narrowly ahead of the Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE),
while another in the Barcelona daily El Periodico has the ruling party
winning by a slender margin. A third poll, published by Madrid's YA
newspaper, has the PP and the PSOE equal, each with 35 per cent of the total
vote.
All three surveys forecast a hung parliament.
