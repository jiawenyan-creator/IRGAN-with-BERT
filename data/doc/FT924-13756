FT  14 OCT 92 / Rise in new businesses falls away
THE SHARP rise in business start-ups that marked the second half of the
1980s slowed to a trickle last year, according to figures for businesses
registering for value added tax announced yesterday.
The wholesaling sector performed best as the recession deepened, while the
construction sector was worst affected.
The net number of VAT-registered businesses - new registrations minus
deregistrations - fell to 3,000 in 1991 from 55,000 a year earlier, and a
peak of 80,000 in 1989.
Some 206,000 businesses registered during the year, while 203,000
deregistered. The total of VAT-registered businesses was practically
unchanged at 1.7m, the Department of Trade and Industry said.
VAT registration figures do not record all businesses at the moment of
start-up, since many trade for a long time before reaching the VAT
threshold, which was annual turnover of Pounds 35,000 last year. Nor do
de-registrations indicate that a business has failed. But they are a good
guide to trends in numbers, the DTI said.
Wholesaling emerged as the most buoyant sector, recording a net increase of
5 per cent in the number of companies. Companies engaged in 'other services'
 -including advertising, management consultancy, entertainment and funeral
directors - grew by 4 per cent while finance, property and professional
services grew by 3 per cent.
The number of companies in all other industry sectors declined, with
particularly sharp falls occurring in the construction sector (4 per cent or
10,000 businesses) and transport (2 per cent), the DTI said.
In the 12 years to the end of 1991, all industry sectors, with the exception
of retailing and agriculture, recorded net increases in the number of active
companies. The retail sector underwent a 4 per cent decline in numbers while
the finance, property and professional services sector grew by more than 100
per cent.
The slowdown in the net number of new businesses was spread across all
regions of the UK. The 1991 figures include an adjustment for the increase
in the VAT registration threshold from Pounds 25,400 to Pounds 35,000 in the
March 1991 Budget.
