FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Canadian province may float
utility
NEWFOUNDLAND is seeking a new buyer for its Newfoundland Hydro utility after
Fortis, a private holding company, broke off negotiations. Alternatively it
may try to float Newfoundland Hydro through a public issue.
The talks between the province and Fortis had been under way since October
1, when Premier Mr Clyde Wells said the sale of the power generation utility
would reduce the province's heavy public debt.
Fortis, based in St John's, already owns Newfoundland Light &amp; Power, the
distributor for the electricity produced by Newfoundland Hydro. Fortis
wanted to merge both into a company with assets of nearly CDollars 2bn
(USDollars 1.5bn), nearly 2,000MW of generating capacity and annual revenues
of about CDollars 700m.
Fortis would not say why negotiations ended, but Mr Wells indicated the
company wanted more control over the merged company than the province was
willing to surrender.
Although faced with charges that privatisation of Newfoundland Hydro would
lead to higher power rates and job losses, Mr Wells said he would consider a
public flotation.
Ontario Hydro confirmed its 1993 loss would be significantly higher than the
CDollars 1.6bn estimate made a month ago, due to restructuring charges and
write-downs.
But the utility reported it would supply USDollars 270m of heavy water to
Korean Electric Power. South Korea has two Canadian-designed nuclear
reactors that use heavy water as a moderator.
Teck, the mining and metals group that controls Cominco, is raising almost
CDollars 105m for new copper investments with an issue of 4.5m shares at
CDollars 23.25 each in Canada and Europe.
It will use the money to meet its share of the USDollars 360m Quebrada
Blanca copper project in Chile and its share of the USDollars 300m
Louvicourt copper-zinc project in Quebec.
