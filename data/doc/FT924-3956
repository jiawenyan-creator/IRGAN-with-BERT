FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Yorkshire boost as Metro Radio advances 10%
Strong growth in its Yorkshire advertising revenue helped Metro Radio Group,
the USM-quoted local radio station operator, boost turnover to Pounds 15.15m
in the 12 months to September 30, from Pounds 12.82 in the previous year,
writes Chris Tighe.
The Tyneside-based group yesterday reported a 12.9 per cent increase in
advertising revenue to Pounds 12.64m (Pounds 11.2m), and 10 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.86m (Pounds 1.69m).
Earnings per share rose slightly to 7.5p (7.2p); total net dividend is

Local and regional advertising revenue grew by 18.7 per cent and national
revenue 2.3 per cent. In Yorkshire alone it was up 30 per cent.
Mr John Josephs, finance director, who becomes group managing director on
