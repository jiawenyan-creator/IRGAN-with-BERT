FT  06 NOV 92 / Russia thwarted on Syrian military debt
A RUSSIAN trade delegation to Syria made little progress this week in
resolving the issue of Syria's Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.6bn) military debt to
the former Soviet Union.
According to Russian diplomats, Syrian officials said other former Soviet
republics were also claiming repayment. The Russians said this was unlikely
in view of a CIS-wide agreement that former Soviet debt devolved to Russia.
A request for a meeting with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad was reportedly
denied. In these circumstances, it was being suggested that Russia is
unlikely to sell military equipment to Syria in the foreseeable future.
In a recent interview, Mr Mohamed al-Imadi, the Syrian minister of economy
and foreign trade, acknowledged that the debt to the former Soviet Union was
'a very delicate issue', and added: 'We are doing our best to build on the
friendship of the past to construct new economic relations with Russia. All
of these issues will be dealt with in time.'
The Russian delegation also went to Lebanon this week, where commercial
relations are flourishing. A joint Russian-Lebanese Middle East studies
centre is being set up in Beirut. And Lebanese businessmen who are well
established in Africa are purchasing former Soviet debt - in, for example,
Congo Brazzaville - at discounted rates.
A Russian diplomat said: 'We have no way of collecting debts in Africa. But
the Lebanese are on the spot and they can, for example, take African
mahogany in lieu of payment and sell it abroad.' Official Syrian figures
quoted in the Financial Times of November 5 said the country's gross
national product showed average recent annual growth of 24 per cent.
Authoritative western estimates put inflation-adjusted growth rather slower,
with real gross domestic product up between 5 and 8 per cent last year.
