  [Text] The human rights situation in Equatorial Guinea is 
gradually improving, according to Alejandro Artusio and Eduardo 
Dualde, two visiting officials from the UN Human Rights 
Commission. They were received by President Obiang Nguema 
Mbasogo at the People's Palace in Malabo yesterday in the 
presence of Francisco Javier Ngomo Mgbengono, the minister of 
justice and religion. The two officials briefed the head of 
state on the outcome of their 15-day human rights investigation 
in Equatorial Guinea. Speaking to newsmen, they expressed 
satisfaction with the human rights situation in the country. 
However, they pointed out that there were still some aspects 
which needed to be improved; however, they did not mention these 
aspects to the media. Sources close to the commission have 
indicated that the mission will end its visit this week.
