IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
FUMIGANT ALTERS CHROMOSOME 
A chemical that is widely used in fumigating grain and for processing silicon 
in the electronics industry can cause long-lasting chromosomal defects in 
humans exposed to it on the job, researchers reported last week in Science. 
Chromosome defects of the type observed can cause cancer and, in fact, 
epidemiological studies of workers who use the chemical, called phosphine, have 
shown a sharply increased incidence of blood cancers such as non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma. 
The team of researchers, headed by pathologist Vincent F. Garry of the 
University of Minnesota, studied white blood cells obtained from 24 male 
workers who apply fumigants to grain, 20 of whom used phosphine. They found 
visible defects in the 23 pairs of chromosomes that store the genetic blueprint 
of humans in the workers who used phosphines but not in those who did not. 
The defects were of two types. Some were short term, persisting for only a few 
days after exposure to the phosphine. Others lasted for at least six months. 
The researchers are now conducting further studies to see if these defects are 
associated with cancer.
