FT  27 AUG 93 / Observer: Devotion
No toil for union leaders. And no overtime either. No, they said, time off
in lieu would simply not do. A conference to discuss the future of the
unions at a luxurious hotel in leafy Surrey at the weekend?
So the brothers and sisters, loath to sacrifice their leisure time, will be
holding this important pow-wow at the Shepperton Moat Hotel mid-week. They
have obviously taken a leaf from the book of a colleague of Observer who
will only meet for breakfast the person with whom he has spent the night.
