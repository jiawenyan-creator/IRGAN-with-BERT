Out-of-band interference to RAS from secondary downlinks in the 1.6 GHz band. 

114. In the Notice, we proposed to codify the Committee's recommendations to eliminate potential harmful out-of-band
interference to RAS from secondary MSS downlinks operating at 1613.81626.5 MHz.
<FOOTCITE>142</FOOTCITE>
 The Committee recommended that such operations be restricted to frequencies separated by the upper edge of the RAS
band by at least 2.2 MHz, that MSS downlink emissions be filtered aboard the spacecraft, that frequencies be selectively
controlled and that an analysis and testing program be conducted in cooperation with the radio astronomy community.
Based on its deliberations, the Committee proposed that we adopt rules governing use of the 1613.81626.5 MHz
band that limit out-of-band emissions so that they do not exceed ^238 dB(W/m2/Hz) during observations at non-VLBA
sites and ^198 dB(W/m2/Hz) during observations at VLBA sites.

115. Motorola argues that the limits proposed in the Notice are too rigid and would unduly constrain MSS operations.
<FOOTCITE>143</FOOTCITE>
 In support, Motorola contends that those limits were devised originally using assumptions that are not applicable
to Big LEO operations. For example, Motorola notes that the calculations assumed an immobile, continuous interference
source, whereas secondary MSS downlink LEO operations would present an intermittent source. Further, Motorola
notes that although the Committee reached a consensus on a recommendation regarding limits, it did not agree on a proposed
rule to govern Big LEO MSS operations. Motorola asserts that instead of adopting specific protection limits applicable
to MSS secondary downlinks, the Commission should only restate the general obligation that secondary services not
cause harmful interference to primary services.

116. LQP and TRW disagree with Motorola. LQP states that our proposal is reasonable and should be adopted.
<FOOTCITE>144</FOOTCITE>
 TRW asserts that Motorola's proposal does not adequately consider the needs of the RAS. It states, however, that if
secondary downlinks are limited to the 1621.351626.5 MHz band, thereby creating a 7.5 MHz guardband between
RAS and secondary MSS, Motorola's proposals would be acceptable.

117. We recognize the need to protect RAS observations from secondary MSS downlink operations. At this juncture,
however, we need not consider specific limits on Big LEO MSS secondary downlinks. Secondary services by definition
shall not cause harmful interference nor claim protection from primary services.
<FOOTCITE>146</FOOTCITE>
 This provision applies to protection of primary services from both in-band and out-of-band emissions and would apply
to secondary MSS downlinks regardless of specified pfd levels. Thus, we see no reason to codify specific pfd limits
as proposed in the Notice. We will instead modify proposed 25.213(a)(2) to note that secondary MSS downlinks
shall not cause harmful interference to primary RAS operations in the 1610.61613.8 MHz band. Further, operators
of secondary downlinks will be required to take whatever steps necessary to resolve interference complaints by radio
astronomers. We expect that an applicant proposing to operate MSS downlinks in the 1613.81626.5 MHz band will
be able to demonstrate in its application that it has sufficient satellite out-of-band emission attenuation to protect
adjacent band U.S. RAS operations based upon the frequency separation inherent in the frequency assignment scheme
adopted here.

118. Finally, Cornell University, Arecibo Observatory, notes its concern that MSS downlink transmissions at 1.6
GHz could have a ``disastrous effect'' on passive space research in the 16101667 MHz band.
<FOOTCITE>147</FOOTCITE>
 LQP, in support of Cornell, notes that the Commission must limit MSS downlink transmissions to the 5.15 MHz proposed
in the Commission's Notice, that is, to 1621.351626.5 MHz.
<FOOTCITE>148</FOOTCITE>
 Motorola responds that ``the 1613.81660 MHz band is not allocated to the RAS on a primary or secondary basis''
and thus is not entitled to protection from secondary MSS downlinks operating outside that band.

Cornell Comments at 35. The 16101667 MHz band is being used passively, without any allocation, by radio
astronomers to observe red-shifted Hydroxyl (OH) emissions.
