FT  09 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Bangladesh aid 'inadequate'
THE government was attacked in the Commons last night for failing to provide
money and equipment on the scale needed to help Bangladesh as it struggles
to recover from the devastation of last week's cyclone. The decision to
provide a further Pounds 2m - bringing the total of emergency aid to Pounds
6.5m - was condemned as inadequate, and there were calls for Britain's armed
forces to be deployed in a massive relief operation. Mrs Lynda Chalker,
minister for overseas development, said Britain was already the largest
single national donor, and that further aid would be provided.
