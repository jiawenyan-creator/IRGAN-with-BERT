FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Delay to waste disposal measures
THE INTRODUCTION of new rules on waste disposal designed to curb cowboy
operators will be postponed for two months because of discussions with the
waste disposal industry, Mr David Maclean, environment minister, said
yesterday. New licensing arrangements will now come into force on June 1
instead of next month.
Under the scheme people or companies dealing in waste disposal or operating
waste dumps have to prove they are 'fit and proper persons'.
