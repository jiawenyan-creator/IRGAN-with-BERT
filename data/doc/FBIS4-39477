Volgograd"] 
  [Text] Volgograd -- Volgograd has become one of the first 
of the province's major cities whose residents will now be able 
to listen to alternative radio every day -- broadcasts from the 
"Novaya Volna" [New Wave] radio station. Broadcasts are 
currently from 0700 through 2200, and in the near future they 
will be around the clock. 
  A powerful autonomous transmitter makes it possible to cover 
a number of rural areas as well as the oblast center. 
  "Although the bulk of the time is devoted to music 
programs," 
Aleksey Kuimov, general director of "Novaya Volna," says, "we 
are also devoting paramount attention to timely new reporting. 
There is a summary of the latest news every hour. Our 
correspondents phone in their reports from the scene. We will 
also be staging a kind of talk show, giving representatives of 
parties and entrepreneurs a chance to say their piece." 
  It is worth noting that the co-owners of the new radio 
station -- apart from the well-known "Tsaritsyn Dvor" trading 
and industrial firm -- include professional media journalists 
whom Volgograders know well from broadcasts on the local "South 
of Russia" cable tv.
