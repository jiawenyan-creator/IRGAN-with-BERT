  [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso has said 
he will not authorize the wage increase for deputies and 
Judicial Branch employees even if the Senate approves it. The 
minister said that he must obey the law, but within the 
limitations of the defense of national interests. 
  Minister Cardoso described the attitude of the deputies as 
sabotage to the country. He regretted that his party, the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party] did not walk out of the 
plenary while the presidential veto on the wage increases were 
voted. 
  Cardoso said that, despite the serious attitude of 
congressmen, there is no reason to speak of closing Congress. 
The minister considered the attitude of military men as 
exemplary. He does not believe, however, that the irresponsible 
behavior of congressmen should be a pretext to attack democracy 
or Congress as an institution.
