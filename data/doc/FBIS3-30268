  [Text] There is currently a break here [in the Serbian 
Assembly]. In the continuation of the session, the chiefs of 
the clubs of deputies have concluded, each for his own side, 
that great efforts to find an agreement have been invested over 
the last five days, but also that the negotiations did not yield 
the desired results. 
  A logical consequence of all this is the repeat of the 
entire 
procedure for the election of the assembly chairman. The 
candidate put forward by the Socialist Party of Serbia is Dragan 
Tomic, director of Jugopetrol and a chief of the Socialists' 
club of deputies, who also stood as a candidate last week. The 
opposition proposed Jorgovanka Tabakovic, economist from 
Pristina, and a deputy of the Serbian Radical Party, as its 
candidate. 
  At the moment there is a break, as I have reported. A debate 
about the candidates will ensue soon, after which the voting 
will be carried out. However, since nobody has changed his 
mind, the chances for the assembly to get a chairman in this 
round of voting are slim. This will be all for the time being.
