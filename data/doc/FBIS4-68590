Reform of the Taxation System"] 
  [Text] The concept of basic reform of the current 
taxation system was supported at the session of the Trade and 
Industry Chamber (TPP) Board held yesterday. The State Duma is 
supporting the position of the most influential organization of 
Russian business circles and is resolutely speaking out for tax 
reform. The position is also shared by an absolute majority of 
entrepreneurs in Russia, who are demanding that the tax pressure 
be relaxed. Nevertheless, KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts have the 
courage to maintain that realization of these tax innovations is 
unlikely at the present time. And this is why. 
  The fact is that representatives of the federal executive 
authority--the government, the Ministry of Finance, and the 
State Tax Service--object to possible tax reforms. This is a 
decisive factor under the current political regime. However, let 
us report everything in order. 
  The TPP Board was preceded by a 3-day discussion of tax 
problems within the framework of a roundtable in which 
representatives of Russian business, government, and legislative 
authority met face to face with each other. Participants in the 
conference examined several directions for possible changes in 
the existing taxation system--the government tax program 
prepared by the Ministry of Finance and two "alternative" 
concepts--by Academician Dmitriy Lvov, deputy director of the 
TsEMI [Central Economics and Mathematics Institute], and 
Professor Vladimir Frolov, president of the "Nalogi Rossii" 
[Taxes of Russia] Association. The fact that Sergey Glazyev, 
chairman of the State Duma Committee on Economic Policy, and 
Aleksandr Ivaneyev, head of the Tax Reform Department of the 
Ministry of Finance, took part in the roundtable shows that the 
Russian authorities are concerned about the subject under 
discussion. Most of the alternative taxation proposals were 
worked out several years ago, although they were brought to 
light only now. What do they consist of? 
<H5>  The Tax Program of Dmitriy Lvov </H5>
  Dmitriy Lvov's concept provides for fundamental reform of 
the 
tax system, for the academician believes it is "fundamentally 
faulty": those sectors of the economy where profit is not being 
created, only redistributed, are being taxed (meaning secondary 
taxation of the incomes of the fuel and energy complex). The 
essence of Academician Lvov's proposals comes down to increasing 
the taxation of "Russia's natural wealth." In particular, it is 
planned to introduce rent payments for oil and gas (they should 
make up over two-thirds of all budget receipts). According to 
the academician's calculations, the state will be able to 
receive $30 billion to $32 billion, or 55 to 60 trillion rubles 
([R] through the rent, which is comparable with the federal 
budget deficit planned this year (about R63 billion). 
  According to Dmitriy Lvov, when the rent payments are 
introduced, all other taxes could be practically removed and 
"tax holidays" could be arranged--at least for the priority 
sectors of industry. This would make it possible to reduce 
enterprises' costs by an average 42 percent. 
  Of course, introduction of rent on gas and oil will require 
that important political decisions be made--in particular, on 
recognition of natural wealth as state property. Otherwise, 
republics and regions will be able to claim exclusive right to 
use the funds received from profit on the minerals they have. 
  In the opinion of many specialists, joined by Academician 
Leonid Abalkin, Lvov's program "deserves attention as a 
logically well-proportioned scientific concept," but its 
realization at present has been made difficult because of 
political instability. 
  According to estimates by KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts, the 
actual budget receipts after the introduction of rent payments 
are unlikely to exceed $12 billion. And the sum of rent from oil 
may not be taken into consideration because it is extremely 
insignificant (the average production cost of oil is $50 per 
metric ton, without taking into account transportation and the 
customs duty--with an export price of about $80). In the 
situation that has taken shape, practically all rent payments 
will come from the profit on gas, which comes to $10 to $15 for 
1,000 cubic meters with an average export price of $80. 
  At the same time, it is also necessary to work out a correct 
system for collecting the rent, inasmuch as an increase in 
domestic prices to the world price level will lead not so much 
to an increase in tax payments as to a new inflationary spiral 
and production recession. A better outcome in this case would be 
to maintain the prices for gas and oil for domestic consumers 
and introduce world prices for the exports. In this case, the 
overall total of rent would be no more than $4.5 billion. 
<H5>  Tax Program of the "Nalogi Rossii" Association </H5>
  Unlike Dmitriy Lvov's program, the concept of Mr. Frolov 
does 
not assume that the existing taxation system is completely 
abolished, but undergoes serious structural restructuring. In 
particular, it provides for an increase in the proportion of 
receipts from resource and land payments and a tax on 
enterprises' property of up to 60 to 70 percent. In this case, 
the inflationary value-added tax must be reduced to 13 percent 
and the tax on profit should be abolished. Inasmuch as the tax 
on profit, together with high bank interest rates, is the basic 
regulator in the struggle against overproduction--that is, 
against what is not seen in Russia at present. All the same, the 
"Nalogi Rossii" program proposes that the NDS [value-added tax] 
be retained, inasmuch as this tax is the hardest to evade. 
  Instead of an income tax on citizens and a tax on profit, 
the 
program provides for introduction of a completely new levy--a 
tax on consumption. In other words, when there is complete 
exemption from the tax on funds for investment, it is planned to 
tax all types of payments to physical persons in physical and 
monetary forms, including loans and representative expenses. The 
funds received from this tax should be spent mainly to pay 
employees in the budgetary financing field. 
  The idea of taxing the consumption fund set forth in the 
"Nalogi Rossii" program is not new--receipts from this levy make 
up about two-thirds of the income part of the budget in most 
economically developed countries. The rate of this tax in Russia 
may reach roughly 40 percent. 
  The association opposes a large number of taxes, although it 
also rejects a one- or two-tax system, inasmuch as it is 
extremely difficult in practice to create a faultless mechanism 
for imposing a single tax which cannot be evaded. 
  In this case, it would be advisable to adopt a tax code--a 
legal document of direct action, for which no interpretations 
and normative documents are required. According to Vladimir 
Frolov, his associates would require no more than 2 to 3 months 
to draft such a document (roughly 500 pages), inasmuch as the 
association already has practical experience now. The 
association president said the cost of his work would be 
moderate. In his words, the association would prepare a draft 
for his country for just R50 million. 
  The Lvov and Frolov concepts are now being considered by the 
Council of the Federation and the State Duma. According to 
information obtained by KOMMERSANT-DAILY, the Duma plans to 
entrust the "Nalogi Rossii" Association and Dmitriy Lvov's group 
with the drafting of two alternative tax codes. This information 
was confirmed by Oleg Grigoryev, an associate of Sergey Glazyev. 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned that the question of financing 
these efforts is now being decided, since the budget funds for 
fundamental studies are obviously inadequate. 
  The actual possibility that either program will be adopted 
will depend on the ability of those drafting the alternative 
plans to find supporters for their ideas among members of the 
government and the president's administration, inasmuch 
as--KOMMERSANT-DAILY reiterates this once again--the opinion of 
the executive authority is decisive on practically any matter 
under the political regime existing in the country.
