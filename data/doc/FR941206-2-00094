ACTION: 

Notice of the expiration of deferred enforced departure (DED) for nationals of EL Salvador.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Immigration and Naturalization Service (``the Service'' or ``INS'') will allow the expiration on December 31,
1994, of the deferred enforced departure (DED) previously granted to certain nationals of El Salvador. After consultation
with appropriate agencies of the Government and consideration of the totality of the impact of the expiration of DED
for Salvadorans, it has been concluded that the political and human rights situation inside El Salvador has improved
significantly and can no longer serve as a basis for the continuation of DED.

EFFECTIVE DATE: 

December 31, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 





Background



Section 303 of the Immigration Act of 1990, Public Law 101649, dated November 29, 1990, designated El Salvador
for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for a period of eighteen (18) months beginning January 1, 1991, and ending June
30, 1992. Eligible nationals of El Salvador who registered under this special TPS program were required to register
by October 31, 1991, and to reregister as required in order to extend TPS benefits.

Temporary Protected Status ended on June 30, 1992. However, on June 26, 1992, the Commissioner of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service announced in the Federal Register at 57 FR 28700 that the deportation of eligible nationals
of El Salvador who had registered for TPS would not be enforced before June 30, 1993. On June 8, 1993, the Service announced
in the Federal Register at 58 FR 32157 a further extension until December 31, 1994, of deferred enforced departure
(DED) for eligible Salvadorans. The two announcements were made at the direction of former President Bush and President
Clinton respectively. Both these grants of DED were based on the serious negative effects that a large repatriation
would have had on the then evolving situation in El Salvador.


After consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government and consideration of the totality of the impact of
the expiration of DED for Salvadorans, it has been concluded that the political and human rights situation inside
El Salvador has improved significantly and can no longer serve as a basis for the continuation of DED.


Automatic Extension of Employment Authorization



In order to ensure an opportunity for Salvadoran beneficiaries of DED to apply for an employment authorization document
(EAD), the Service is granting an automatic extension until September 30, 1995, of the validity of any EAD which expires
on December 31, 1994, and was previously issued to a DED Salvadoran pursuant to 8 CFR 274a.12(a)(11). Affected Salvadorans
should apply for their new EADs at least 3 months before the expiration of the automatic extension (that is, no later
than June 30, 1995) in order to ensure continuous employment authorization.


Employers of DED Salvadorans



Employers of DED Salvadorans whose employment authorization is automatically extended may not refuse to accept,
for purposes of verifying or reverifying employment eligibility until September 30, 1995, an employment authorization
document (EAD), Form I688B, bearing an expiration date of December 31, 1994, (or extension sticker punched
for December 1994) and containing a notation ``274a.12(a)(11)'' or ``274a.12(a)(12)'' on the face of the document
under ``Provision of Law.'' Employers are reminded that this action does not affect the right of a worker to present
any other legally acceptable document as proof of work authorization.


Impact of Decision


The Service believes that the decision to end DED will have a delayed and gradual impact on members of the Salvadoran
community in the United States who currently hold DED status. Under the settlement agreement reached in 

American Baptist Churches

 v. 

Thornburgh,

 760 F. Supp. 796 (N.D. Cal. 1991) (``

ABC

'') affected Salvadorans will be able to maintain legal employment authorization pending a review of their asylum
applications. Those 

ABC

 class members who have not filed asylum applications will have an opportunity to do so. In addition to the rights afforded
under the 

ABC

 agreement, many Salvadorans have adjusted and will continue to adjust status to lawful permanent residence on the
basis of family relationships and other grounds.
All Salvadorans who initially registered for TPS, regardless of whether they later registered for DED, are 

ABC

 class members. As 

ABC

 class members, they are entitled to certain rights under the agreement. On or about March 31, 1995, the Service will
send class members a notice advising that they must submit an initial asylum application (Form I589) with the
INS appropriate service center within 90 days, if they have not filed an asylum application previously. A previously
filed asylum application may be supplemented. Class members also have the option of filing a new asylum application
even if they had previously filed for asylum. Class members may supplement a previously filed or newly filed asylum
application until the date of the decision by the asylum officer.
