  [Text] Vienna, 18 May -- Commenting on the issue of 
replacing fuel rods at an experimental atomic reactor in 
Yongbyun, North Korea on 18 May, an official at the North Korean 
Embassy in Vienna said: "Inspectors from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be able to take samples of 
spent fuel when the fuel rods are replaced if U.S.-North Korea 
talks are resumed." 
  It is the first time that a North Korean official has 
definitely hinted at the possibility of IAEA inspectors taking 
samples of spent fuel at the experimental atomic reactor. 
  The North Korean official told a MAINICHI SHIMBUN reporter 
about the possibility on 18 May. So far, North Korea has 
refused to allow IAEA inspectors to take the samples of spent 
fuel to determine if North Korea has diverted uranium for 
military purposes. North Korea appears to have begun to soften 
its stand on the issue now that the United States has taken up 
the issue seriously. 
  Asked to comment on reports that "a substantially large 
number of fuel rods" have been replaced at the experimental 
atomic reactor, the North Korean diplomat said: "I do not know 
how many fuel rods have been replaced."
