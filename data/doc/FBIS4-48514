  [Text] Cape Town May 19 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress has a marginally higher percentage membership in the 
Constitutional Assembly than in the National Assembly, although 
still short of the two-thirds majority which would have enabled 
it to unilaterally rewrite South Africa's constitution. 
  The Constitutional Assembly (CA), to be constituted on 
Tuesday, comprises the 400 National Assembly (NA) members who 
were sworn in last Monday, sitting together with the 90 senators 
to be sworn in Friday (MAy 20). 
  The CA is to be tasked with writing South Africa's final 
constitution over the next two years, applying 34 principles set 
out in the interim constitution. 
  The ANC will have 252 NA members and 60 senators, giving it 
63.67 per cent of the seats in the Constitutional Assembly 
compared with 63 per cent in the NA. 
  The National Party, with 82 members in the NA and 17 in the 
Senate, will have 20.20 per cent of the seats in the CA compared 
with 20.5 in the NA. 
  The Inkatha Freedom Party has 9.79 per cent of the seats in 
the CA, the Freedom Front 2.85, the Democratic Party 2.04, the 
Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] 1.02 and the African Christian 
Democratic Party [ACDP] 0.4. Neither the PAC nor the ACDP has 
any senators.
