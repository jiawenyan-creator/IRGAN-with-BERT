FT  22 FEB 93 / EC proposes measures to avert fishing sector crisis
THE European Commission yesterday said it would propose measures in the
coming days to avert a crisis in the EC's fishing sector due to cheap
imports and recent currency turmoil, Reuter reports from Brussels
The decision to improve the market follows a meeting between French and
Commission fisheries officials in Brussels.
Prices had fallen by 15 to 30 per cent across the Community and cheap
imports from Russia, Norway and Iceland, as well as currency fluctuations in
the EC, had aggravated troubles within the fishing industry, the Commission
said.
The measures to 'improve prices' would be drawn up by EC Fisheries
Commissioner Yannis Paleokrassas and presented by the Commission imminently
 -probably by mid-week.
