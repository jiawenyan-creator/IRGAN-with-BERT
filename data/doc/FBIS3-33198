  [Text] Three political parties have accepted the EZLN's 
[Zapatist National Liberation Army] invitation to be present at 
the dialogue for peace in Chiapas. 
  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, PRD [Party of the Democratic 
Revolution], candidate, said his party will appoint a commission 
to attend the meeting. The Authentic Party of the Mexican 
Revolution also agreed to attend the dialogue but ruled out that 
its presidential candidate, Alvaro Perez Trevino, will form part 
of its delegation. The Labor Party will also send 
representatives to Chiapas. 
  Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, presidential candidate of the 
PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], said in Acapulco that 
the party's national committee is analyzing the proposal to send 
delegates to the peace talks in Chiapas. He said the party 
supports any initiative in favor of a dialogue and a concerted 
political solution for peace in Chiapas. He added that the 
release of Absalon Castellanos and the upcoming dialogue should 
encourage everyone. The PRI candidate also said he hopes the 
Chiapas conflict will not affect the electoral process in August. 
  Because the National Action Party [PAN] believes that the 
EZLN armed movement is clandestine and uses violence, it has 
rejected the EZLN's invitation to attend the peace talks next 
week. PAN leader Carlos Castillo Peraza said his party will 
only accept the invitation if the EZLN abandons its clandestine 
nature and the use of violence and lays down its weapons. He 
stated that the country can be changed through the policy of 
peace, dialogue, and publicly assumed commitments. He urged the 
EZLN to abandon its violent attitude and respect the lives of 
peasants. He also said the Mexican Army should guarantee the 
human rights of the rebels.
