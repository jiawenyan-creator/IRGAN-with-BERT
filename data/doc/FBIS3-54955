  [Excerpt] [Shevtsov over video of troops on maneuvers] 
For the internal troops, just as for the entire country, this 
year has been extremely difficult and even dramatic. In the most 
difficult conditions, officers and men continued to guard 
important state installations and special cargoes as well as 
corrective-labor camps. 
  Together with other internal affairs personnel they 
performed 
successfully in the special operations Gastroler, Signal, Koltso 
and Arsenal. 
  In the state of emergency regions troop units carried out 
over 70 operations, seized thousands of firearms and other 
weapons, and saved the lives of hundreds of innocent people. 
  This and many other difficult problems and tasks for the 
internal troops were discussed today by Russian Ministry of 
Internal Affairs okrug commanders and troop training 
establishment chiefs who participated in an all-Russia rally.
