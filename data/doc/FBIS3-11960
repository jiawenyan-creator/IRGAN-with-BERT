  [Text] Buenos Aires, 28 Mar (NA) -- At Cuban leader Fidel 
Castro's request, a group of professionals from the Secretariat 
for the Prevention of Drug Abuse and the Antinarcotics Struggle 
will travel to that country "to train Cuban Government officials 
in the prevention and control of the illegal drug trade." 
  The agreement between Argentina and Cuba is part of a Latin 
American program on prevention, assistance, and control of the 
illegal drug trade drawn up by Argentina and approved by the OAS 
"to include cooperation and professional assistance among 
American countries."
