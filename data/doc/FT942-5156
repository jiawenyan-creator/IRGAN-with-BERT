FT  06 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: Cementos Lima is Peru's first OTC offer
Peru's first ever over-the-counter primary offering is scheduled for June
15, when the state's 39 per cent stake in Cementos Lima, the cement
producer, will be offered simultaneously in New York and Lima, writes Sally
Bowen in Lima.
The allocation will be by Dutch auction and the reference price is expected
to be about Dollars 200 for each of the 308,843 voting shares on offer. Lead
managing the issue is Bankers Trust/Peruval, with Bankers, Baring, Bear
Stearns and JP Morgan Securities handling the New York end, where the offer
will be restricted to qualified institutional buyers. Lima brokers may
register to participate on auction day, but will be required to deposit
letters of guarantee for 97 per cent of their bid. Amounts are likely to be
much higher than they usually handle.
Cementos Lima is Peru's leading cement producer with more than 40 per cent
of the domestic market.
