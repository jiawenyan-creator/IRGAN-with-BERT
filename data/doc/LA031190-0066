STORY'S UNFAIR TO BP 
Until the article "British Petroleum Is Accused of Dragging Its Feet" (March 1) 
appeared, I had heard nothing but praise for BP and all other agencies involved 
in the cleanup of the Feb. 7 oil spill. Beaches are now being opened, and 
everyone is congratulating each other for the containment of damages. 
One person, Reed Smith, a patrol lieutenant, was found by your reporter and had 
nothing to say but bad things about BP and its efforts to clean up our Orange 
County. This article would make more sense if we were still wallowing in oil 
around here. It sounds more like sour grapes on the part of Mr. Smith, in that 
everything was not done to his personal satisfaction and ideas as to how to 
clean things up. 
The only positive thing to counter all this negative information in the article 
was one sentence that the commandant of the Coast Guard praised BP for being a 
good corporate citizen.
