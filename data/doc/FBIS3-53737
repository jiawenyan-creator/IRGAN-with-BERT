  [Text] In the south, the Amal Movement Operations Room 
issued a statement a while ago saying that at 1820 today the 
Group of Martyrs Bassam Humani and Jihad Tawbah laid ambush near 
al-Thurah position to a joint Israeli-Lahd patrol. The group 
fired machine guns and rockets at the patrol, killing a number 
of Israeli soldiers. 
  Following the operation, the statement says, the Israelis 
shelled the outskirts of Kafr Rumman and the abandoned Army 
barracks in al- Nabatiyah with 82- and 120-mm guns from their 
positions in al-Dabshah and al-Thurah. The Amal Movement vowed 
to its members, the wounded and those who are being held in 
Israeli prisons, to liberate all the soil of the south.
