of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps] 
  [Text] Over the last few years, holding back teachers' 
wages has been very common, and this also has been the case in 
Xinjiang. According to a friend of mine who works at a farm of 
the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, they have not 
received their wages for more than 10 months, making their lives 
very difficult. Although the government has called for issuing 
overdue wages before New Year's day, many localities have not or 
have not thoroughly solved the problem. Education is the 
underlying requirement for building the country and teachers are 
the key to promoting education. To promote education, first we 
should assure teachers of the basic needs for their daily lives 
and ensure that they can concentrate on their work. Without 
feeding a horse, how can you ask it to run? With an empty 
stomach, how can a teacher teach? We have been shouting for 
enhancing teachers status but little has really been done. I 
feel sad. 
  With the Spring Festival around the corner, we earnestly 
hope 
the "Teachers Law" will be conscientiously carried out and 
leaders at all levels will regard issuing teachers overdue pay 
as an important matter so that teachers can enjoy a happy and 
prosperous Spring Festival.
