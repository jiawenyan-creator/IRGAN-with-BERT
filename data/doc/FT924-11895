FT  23 OCT 92 / Kuwait Airbus deal
Airbus Industrie has agreed to buy back from Kuwait Airways six older
wide-body aircraft as part of a deal to supply the airline with a fleet of
new aircraft, writes Paul Betts, Aerospace Correspondent. The six aircraft,
built in the late 1970s and early 1980s, were captured by Iraq when it
invaded Kuwait two years ago.
