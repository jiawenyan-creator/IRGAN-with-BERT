FT  02 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: British Petroleum
BP's debt mountain, which previously threatened to engulf the group, is
firmly under control. Disposals and strong cash flow have reduced debt by
Dollars 6bn since 1992, helping to cut the interest burden. On the trading
front, the outlook appears promising with profits growth driven by a
recovery in petrochemicals prices and continued cost cutting.
BP is now in the happier position of deciding how much of its cash flow
should be invested and how much distributed to shareholders. After its
previous traumas, the management is right to be cautious. But earnings can
be advanced only so far by reducing costs and there is a danger the group
could miss opportunities through under-investment. With BP's return on
capital at 12 per cent - better than all but a couple of its US rivals - the
company can afford to increase capital spending. But BP's exploration effort
is proving highly productive, so it may not need to invest a great deal more
to increase its global market share.
The stock still has ground to recover after its collapse in 1991 and 1992.
As the group's rehabilitation continues, it should continue to outperform
its oil peers. BP remains at a discount of up to 15 per cent against US
groups on both a cash flow and price earnings basis. True, the yield is
still low. But if the company can deliver on the market's expectations of 20
per cent dividend growth, that will no longer appear so great a drawback.
