FT  29 APR 91 / N Ireland talks
THE FIRST discussions in the round-table talks on Northern Ireland's
political future will be between government ministers, the nationalist
Social Democratic and Labour party and the Alliance party, Ralph Atkins
writes. The talks will start tomorrow.
Leaders of the Unionist parties are not expected to meet Mr Peter Brooke,
Northern Ireland secretary, until late this week.
The first plenary session, involving all the political parties and covering
devolution in the province, is expected next week. The government of the
Irish Republic will enter the talks later.
