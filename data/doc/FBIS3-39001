<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "CDA Drops to 37 Seats in Opinion </F>
Polls"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- The CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] 
is falling from voters' favor. The largest party is at a low 
point with 24 percent of the vote, or 37 seats in the House. 
That is a loss of 17 seats, according to the "political 
barometer" of the Inter-View bureau. 
  The researchers attribute the fall to the fuss surrounding 
the CDA's proposals regarding the Old Age Pension Act. In the 
upcoming term of office, the party wants to put a freeze on all 
benefit payments, including the old age pension. At the last 
poll, taken before this news was known, the CDA could still 
count on 27.1 percent of the voters. 
  The VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] in 
particular has benefitted from the CDA's loss. The liberals now 
have 32 seats, an increase of 10. D66 [Democrats 66] also has 
32 seats, an increase of 20. The PvdA [Labor Party] still has 
about 28 seats, a loss of 21. 
  Green Left, which now has six seats in the Lower House, 
would 
appear to have four more. SGP [Political Reformed Party] and 
GPV [Reformed Political Union] remain stable, while the RPF 
[Reformational Political Federation] has climbed from one to 
three. The Center Democrats, who, it was initially thought, 
would get seven seats, are stuck on three seats, an increase of 
two.
