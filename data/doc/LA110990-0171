LOCAL; 
JUDGE RULES NEW MARCOS HEARING 
A dispute over whether there is a settlement in a racketeering lawsuit brought 
against Imelda Marcos by the Philippine government requires an evidentiary 
hearing, a federal judge in Los Angeles ruled today. 
The lawsuit is an attempt by the Philippines to recover some of the billions of 
dollars that the government of President Corazon Aquino alleges were stolen 
during two decades of rule by the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos. 
The attorney representing Marcos' widow claims Manila agreed to settle in 
exchange for 60% of funds in Hong Kong bank accounts controlled by the former 
first lady. The amount was not revealed, however. 
U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer scheduled the hearing for Dec. 10.
