  [Text] In the Kashmir Valley, the curfew in Kupwara town 
has been relaxed for four hours from 1000 this morning following 
an improvement in the situation. The curfew was imposed on 
Thursday evening following violent incidents resulting in the 
death of 18 persons, including three policemen. The state 
government has already ordered an inquiry into the incident. 
Ex-gratia payment to the next of kin of those killed has also 
been announced. 
  The union home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, says the first 
priority with the central government is to end militancy in 
Jammu and Kashmir. Addressing a rally in Jammu today, he 
appealed to all political parties to shed their individual 
differences and join hands to help restore normalcy in the 
state. He said once militancy is contained, the state can go in 
for elections. 
  Mr. Chavan said Jammu, Ladakh, and Kashmir will remain 
integral parts of Jammu and Kashmir as much as the state remains 
an integral part of India. Mr. Chavan said Pakistan's efforts 
to divide people in the name of religion and incite militancy 
will never succeed. He said a new thinking has already emerged 
among the masses who are fed up with the activities of the 
militants. He assured the people that all necessary security 
will be provided for those who work in the valley. 
  Speaking on the occasion, the pradesh [state] Congress-I 
president, Mr. Ghulam Rasool Kar, suggested that a political 
adviser be appointed in Jammu and Kashmir State. A check of 
125,000 rupees was presented on behalf of the Jammu and Kashmir 
Pradesh Congress-I Committee to Mr. Chavan for the victims of 
the Maharashtra earthquake. Mr. Chavan is scheduled to visit 
some camps of Kashmir migrants near Jammu this afternoon.
