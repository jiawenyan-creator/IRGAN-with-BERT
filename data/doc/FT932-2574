FT  18 JUN 93 / Congress party chiefs give full support to Rao
THE TOP policy-making body of India's ruling Congress party yesterday
expressed 'full faith and confidence' in the leadership of Mr P V Narasimha
Rao, the prime minister, who was accused on Wednesday of accepting a bribe
of Rs10m (Pounds 210,000) from Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker at the
centre of the Bombay securities scandal.
The Congress working committee said it saw a 'sinister game and pattern'
behind Mr Mehta's 'baseless and malicious aspersions'. Mr Arjun Singh, a
cabinet minister, and Mr Sharad Pawar, chief minister of Maharashtra state,
who are the prime minister's two main opponents within the party, staunchly
supported Mr Rao, who seemed tired and distraught after the latest political
storm in his turbulent two-year tenure.
At a press conference on Wednesday Mr Mehta alleged that he had given Mr Rao
a suitcase-full of money to fund a by-election in November 1991, five months
before the Rs50bn Bombay financial scandal which brought Mr Mehta's
downfall.
Rumours that Mr Rao would resign had unsettled Indian stock markets
yesterday, but trading was thin.
Opposition leaders none the less demanded the resignation of Mr Rao.
The Hindu Bharatiya Janata party, the largest opposition party, which is
currently holding its annual policy-making meeting in the southern city
Bangalore, said that the country 'could not afford a scam-tainted and
insecure prime minister' and demanded an independent investigation into the
stockbroker's allegations.
Several members of the parliamentary committee investigating the financial
scan - dal yesterday demanded that Mr Rao be summoned before the committee
for questioning.
Mr Mehta's lawyer yesterday demanded that the government's Central Bureau of
Investigation investigate the charges against the prime minister.
