<F P=106> [Interview with Massimo D'Alema, deputy secretary of the </F>
Italian Democratic Party of the Left, by Francesco Verderami; 
place and date not given: "`Our Aim Is To Win Elections; We Will 
Guarantee Governability, Whatever Happens'"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Verderami] Could we 
say that the messages issued by [Democratic Party of the Left, 
PDS, Secretary] Occhetto to [Italian Popular Party, PPI, 
Secretary] Martinazzoli over the past few days were rather 
premature, in view of the fact that you will not be reaching any 
agreements with the PPI until after the elections.... 
  [D'Alema] Let us draw a distinction between two separate 
issues. On the one hand, we are convinced of the need for a 
Catholic contribution to the progressive alignment; on the other 
hand, we are closely observing the operation being conducted by 
Martinazzoli, who intends to make a break with the DC [Christian 
Democratic Party]. We consider it important that such a force 
as the PPI is not allowing itself to be drawn into a 
center-right alliance. The left must keep open a debate with 
such a force. We do not put [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi 
and Martinazzoli on the same footing. The PPI has decided to 
remain in opposition to us. But with such a force -- especially 
if a presence of nonconfessional forces including [Pact for 
Italy leader] Segni himself forms around Martinazzoli -- a 
moderate pole will form with which it is possible to conduct a 
dialogue. 
  [Verderami] After the elections.... 
  [D'Alema] First, there are the elections, and we are 
contesting them with the aim of winning, of gaining a 
parliamentary majority -- a difficult objective, of course, but 
not impossible. And we are also contesting the elections in the 
belief that even if we do gain a parliamentary majority, we must 
work to build a government of national reconstruction. This, 
because we believe that today, in a period of transition such as 
this, the country needs not a left-wing government but a 
government that can perform the role of guarantor. 
  [Verderami] With whom can such a government be built? 
  [D'Alema] If, as seems likely, none of the alignments were 
to 
gain a majority, a responsible force such as the PDS would in 
any case help to guarantee the country a government. It is 
unreasonable to believe that if there is no majority there will 
be another election: That would cause the Italian crisis to go 
into a dangerous spin. So if necessary we will work to support 
a government such as Ciampi's. I believe a responsible force 
such as the PDS must now provide such a guarantee. The political 
choice is clear. We are willing to govern, and want to govern, 
and if we gain a majority we will shoulder this task. But in any 
case we want to guarantee the country's governability. 
  [Verderami] With whom? 
  [D'Alema] Certainly not with the League. There is a very 
deep gulf, which permits neither of us, I assume, to consider 
governing together. So the election result must make it 
possible for the country to be governed without [League 
Secretary] Bossi, without Berlusconi, and without [National 
Alliance leader] Fini. Obviously, therefore, after the 
elections there could be a convergence with the PPI to support a 
government that will govern the transition phase. 
  [Verderami] Do you still have Ciampi in mind for prime 
minister, or would you also accept someone such as [Institute 
for Industrial Reconstruction Chairman] Prodi? 
  [D'Alema] I consider it very old-fashioned to be still 
thinking about the government in terms of individuals. Things 
are not like that any more: We have a first-past-the-post 
system that can create unexpected parliamentary majorities. Be 
that as it may, as I have already said in the past, I believe 
Ciampi is one of the people on whom the country can depend at 
this difficult and delicate time. He has been a good prime 
minister, enjoying great international prestige, and displaying 
great democratic correctness. I do not at all regret having 
voted in favor of his Finance Bill. He does not want to be 
anyone's candidate; he wants to remain impartial. And I say, 
thank goodness that there are people in this country who, even 
without party allegiances, have shown themselves capable of 
serving the state very loyally. Perhaps we need more such 
people. 
  [Verderami] Will we also need ministers from Ciampi's 
government? 
  [D'Alema] Some, yes. There are some highly qualified 
figures, such as Spaventa and Cassese, for instance -- 
specialists who have displayed excellent government capabilities. 
  [Verderami] What about Mancino? Now he is only half an 
interior minister, but in the past he won some major battles 
against the Mafia. 
  [D'Alema] In the case of that ministry, I see a need for a 
break with the past. That ministry, more than any other, has 
represented continuity with old-style government. I have 
nothing personal against Mancino: There must be a non-Christian 
Democrat at the Interior Ministry. 
  [Verderami] Is there anyone in the People's [Popular] Party 
you would welcome in a "government of national reconstruction"? 
  [D'Alema] Certainly, which is why it is necessary to 
maintain 
the dialogue with the PPI -- because of what it stands for 
politically, and also because it is a party that includes such 
figures as Prodi, Mattarella, Bindi, Anselmi... 
  [Verderami] Should the next government have constituent 
powers? 
  [D'Alema] It could have a "function of proposal," but the 
institutional reforms must be completed by parliament. For 
instance, the next legislature should revise the electoral law. 
  [Verderami] Would you again propose a two-round system or, 
in 
view of how the political panorama is changing shape, would you 
opt for a plain British-style single-candidate system? 
  [D'Alema] A two-round system is more consistent with the 
situation in our country. But it remains to be seen how the 
political process evolves. For instance, I have proposed that 
after the elections the elective representatives of the 
progressive area form a group. That would be a good thing. And 
if we were to move toward the formation of homogeneous political 
areas, the British system would be unnecessary.
