FT  22 AUG 92 / Office equipment supplier is placed in receivership
DECIMO International, the family-owned office equipment supplier trading
under the 'Decimo Vatman' brand name, has been placed in administrative
receivership, Michael Cassell writes.
KPMG Peat Marwick was yesterday appointed receiver of the company.
Decimo, founded in 1968, imported a range of goods under its own brand name
 -including facsimile machines, word processors and photocopiers from the
Far East - and grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s.
Early this year annual turnover was reported at Pounds 7.4m but the company
has been badly hit by the recession as employers have reduced office costs.
Decimo's problems were compounded by the increasing tendency of overseas
equipment manufacturers to end agency arrangements and sell direct to
customers.
Mr Tony Thompson, the joint receiver, said last night that a change in
policy by Far Eastern suppliers 'was the final straw'.
Decimo, based in Luton, recently employed about 60 people but staff is down
to 12.
Mr Thompson said: 'The recession is now affecting the most renowned
companies. Decimo have developed products which are noted for their
reliability, innovation and value-for-money.'
In view of the company's reputation, he was hopeful it could be sold as a
going concern.
