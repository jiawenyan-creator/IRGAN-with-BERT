CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS 
Schanche missed an opportunity to enlighten your readership about the true 
landfall of Christopher Columbus. He could have based his article on 
substantive landfall knowledge from the scholarly Oct. 13 workshop at John 
Hopkins University. 
Instead, he relied on three blind mice groping for rationalizations at the Pier 
66 Resort and Marina in Fort Lauderdale. 
Both Joseph Judge and several Samuel Eliot Morison spokesmen were invited to 
join me at the Hopkins workshop (Robert Power's reconstruction is ludicrous). 
All Morison supporters wisely declined. Judge did give his colorful slide show, 
but then immediately skedaddled to avoid probing of his flimsy evidence. If I 
had been invited to Fort Lauderdale, Schanche would have learned: 
All independent experts agree that Columbus navigated accurately by latitude 
sailing rather than blindly by dead reckoning. This places him squarely in the 
middle of North East Providence Channel next to Egg Island instead of 90 or 
more miles south. 
The 98 journal clues describing four Bahama islands on his route to Cuba give 
overwhelming support of the northern route originating at Egg Island. Even 
though this third-hand copy of the journal is "peppered with demonstrable 
mistakes," there are 20 consecutive clues that fit my third island far better 
than Morison's. 
The earliest known detailed landfall map, by the French engineer Alain Manesson 
Mallet in 1685, displays many of the unique features of Egg Island and none of 
Watlings. 
The earliest mapping of Columbus' island names into modern ones was published 
by Don Antonio de Alcedo in 1786 before the landfall controversy developed. The 
highly respected Don Antonio took it for granted that Columbus entered the New 
World through North East Providence Channel, stopping at New Providence (not 
Rum Cay!) on his way to Cuba.
