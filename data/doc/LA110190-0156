SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA; 
BOARD UPGRADES COMPUTERS 
City Directors voted Tuesday to upgrade their computer capabilities. 
Since 1987, some directors have struggled along with Hewlett-Packard personal 
computers models that are incompatible with much of the IBM software on the 
market. 
Others use IBM computers with small memory capacity. 
The board approved spending $19,770 for new computer terminals, printers and 
software, which will enable them, as Director Rick Cole put it, to "take full 
advantage of the power of personal computing in the 1990s."
