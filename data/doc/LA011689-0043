THE WORLD 
East German police detained 80 protesters in Leipzig after several hundred 
people tried to march through the city to demand freedom of expression and 
assembly, Protestant church sources said. Demonstrators who reportedly had 
gathered outside the city's Old Town Hall for the march ignored calls to 
disperse, and police moved in, detaining 80. Witnesses reported use of force by 
police but gave no details. The marchers apparently had planned to call for the 
release of 11 human rights and peace activists. Leaflets announcing the 
demonstration, and calling for freedom of assembly and expression and a free 
press, were found last week in Leipzig, East Germany's second-largest city.
