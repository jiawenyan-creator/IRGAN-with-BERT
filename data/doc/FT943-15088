FT  12 JUL 94 / Agreement signed on frigate
Defence ministers of France, Italy and Britain yesterday signed an agreement
committing themselves to further development of the common next-generation
frigate. Mr Francois Leotard, Mr Cesare Previti and Mr Malcolm Rifkind
signed the memorandum of understanding in London. It governs design,
development and production of the ship. A separate pact to begin work
fleshing out the design shortly was also signed. The frigate, Project
Horizon, is primarily for air defence and will replace Type 42 destroyers in
the Royal Navy while the French ships are intended as aircraft carrier
escorts and the Italian for general duties.
A total of 22 ships are planned, 12 for the UK, six for Italy and four for
France, at a cost of Pounds 6bn-Pounds 8bn. Three 'first of class' ships are
expected in service in 2002. The prime contract is expected to be handled by
a joint venture company comprising DCN International for France,
Finmeccanica and Fincantieri of Italy and a group headed by GEC-Marconi for
Britain.
