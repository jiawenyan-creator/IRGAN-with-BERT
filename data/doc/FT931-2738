FT  18 MAR 93 / People: Non-executive directors - Amstrad
Michael Beckett, the boardroom troubleshooter whose charges have included
Tace and Ultramar, has been appointed as a non-executive director at
Amstrad.
However Beckett, who once described himself as a 'very independent'
non-executive director, insists that his role at Amstrad will not be one of
company doctor.
'I happen to think Amstrad is one of the great success stories in Britain,'
he says. 'I am very much taken with Alan Sugar's attitude to the future; I
think the company can do great things.'
Beckett is Amstrad's second non-executive appointment. Last month the
consumer electronics company appointed Jeoff Samson, a former senior GEC
executive, following Alan Sugar's promise during his unsuccessful share
buy-back attempt in December to appoint two non-executive directors to the
board.
Yesterday Amstrad said the board has decided to pass responsibility for the
selection of a possible third non-executive to Beckett and Samson.
Beckett, aged 56, is an ex-managing director of Consolidated Gold Fields. He
was a non-executive at RHM until last year and is deputy chairman at Watts,
Blake, Bearne, and chairman designate at Horace Clarkson.
