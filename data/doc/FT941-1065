FT  26 MAR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Confidence trick?
The local tax office says that any non-capital withdrawals from Tessas or
Peps, although non-taxable, will count as income for age-allowance reduction
purposes. If so, this more than negates the value and purpose of these
investments for many people over 60. What happens on the maturity of a
Tessa, for example? Is this yet another government confidence trick?
Anything which does not form part of your 'total income' for tax purposes
(as defined in section 835(5) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988,
as amended) is ignored for age-allowance clawback purposes. Thus, it is not
a case of a government confidence trick - merely of Inland Revenue
incompetence.
