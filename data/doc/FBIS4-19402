  [Text] Paris, April 14 (AFP) -- France on Thursday [14 
April] condemned a ban on AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE and CNN 
correspondents in Serbia and Montenegro and demanded the 
immediate cancellation of the measure. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said Belgrade's 
decision to withdraw press accreditation from AFP and CNN 
correspondents was "inadmissible," adding: "We demand the 
immediate cancellation of these measures." 
  U.S. State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said of the 
move Wednesday: "Our view of this, in short, is that it stinks. 
We deplore the Belgrade regime's disregard for the most basic 
internationally agreed principles protecting free speech and 
freedom of the press," said the spokesman. 
  The Yugoslav information ministry on Wednesday withdrew 
accreditations from AFP bureau chief Nicolas Miletitch and three 
other journalists to cover events in Serbia and Montenegro, but 
not for Serb-held areas of Croatia and Bosnia. 
  The AFP journalists whose accreditation was withdrawn can 
continue to coordinate coverage of events in Macedonia and 
Albania.
