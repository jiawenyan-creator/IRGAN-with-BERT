FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 200m Devro heads for market
DEVRO, the Scotland-based producer of sausage skins, is to raise about
Pounds 80m in new money through an offer for sale later this month, which is
expected to value the company at more than Pounds 200m.
The company was the subject of a Pounds 108m management buy-out from the US
multinational Johnson and Johnson in 1991. It claims to be the world's
leading producer of products made from collagen, a natural protein used for
making edible sausage casings and film.
According to the pathfinder prospectus, issued yesterday by Charterhouse,
Devro has more than half the world market for small diameter collagen
sausage casings, three times that of its nearest competitor.
Mr Frank De Angeli, chief executive, acknowledged yesterday that the
flotation had been 'somewhat marred' by last week's announcement that Devro
was to pay Pounds 390,000 to Mr David Fyfe after it withdrew its offer of
the post of chief executive, in succession to Mr De Angeli.
The company decided, following pre-flotation talks with potential investors,
to nominate Mr Graeme Alexander, Devro's technical director.
The pathfinder says unaudited sales in the first five months of 1993 were
almost 20 per cent higher than in 1992.
In 1992 Devro made operating profits of Pounds 22.1m on sales of Pounds
82.7m. It will use the flotation to cut gearing to 50 per cent and fund
expansion.
Impact day, when the full prospectus is issued, will be June 17 and dealing
begin on June 30.
