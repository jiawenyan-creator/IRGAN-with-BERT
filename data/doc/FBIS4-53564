  [Text] Tokyo, may 20 KYODO -- Agriculture Minister Mutsuki 
Kato called Friday [20 May] for an overhaul of the present 
system of calculation for public service rates. 
  Kato made the remark after Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's 
government endorsed a freeze on public service charges until the 
end of the year. 
  It is necessary to make a thorough review of the calculation 
system rather than merely postpone rate hikes, he said.
