  [Abstract] Oxygen-free glasses containing sulfur, selenium, 
tellurium, and other heavy metals are used widely in the optical 
industry and the effluents resulting from production have been 
analyzed in efforts to develop effective measures for lowering 
the toxic metal content. Thus the present work recommends 
determination of Cu(II) and Pb (II) in the presence of other 
heavy elements using the volt-amperometric technique employing a 
crown ester (dibenzo-18-crown-6) modified coal-paste electrode. 
Volt-amperograms were recorded on a PU-1 polarograph and a PO- 
5122 oscillographic polarograph Model 03. Concentration of 
Cu(II) and Pb(II) (as complexes with the crown ester) takes 
place on the surface of the coal paste electrode within 1.0 - 
1.5 minutes. Copper and lead were determined in effluents 
containing Mn(II, III), Fe(II, III), Zn, Ag. Ti, Hg, Ge, Se, and 
Te with a sensitivity lower level of 9.5 X 10 [.sup]-9[/] 
(Cu) and 2 X 10[.sup]-9[/] (Pb) mole per liter. Figures 2;
