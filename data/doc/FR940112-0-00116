 

Subsection (c) states that meters, centimeters, and millimeters must be used as well as inches in linear measure.


Subsection (d) requires that area measurement use square meters, square decimeters, square centimeters, and square
millimeters as well as square yards, square feet, and square inches. 

Subsection (e) states that dry measure statements shall use liters and milliliters as well as bushels, pecks, dry
quarts, and pints. 

Subsection (f) requires, in cubic measure disclosures, the use of cubic meters, cubic centimeters, and, cubic centimeters
as well as cubic yards, cubic feet, and cubic inches. 



E. Section 500.9Units of Weight and Mass, How Expressed 



The Commission amends this section to include the requirement for the use of mass as well as weight and continues to
describe the appropriate customary inch/pound units to be used on packages of various weights. 

Subsection (a) includes the ``net mass'' disclosure and has several metric examples added. The amended subsection
allows the term ``net mass'' as an alternative to ``net weight'' in stating the net quantity of contents. 

The comments state that the requirement to use the terms ``net weight'' or ``net mass'' is unnecessary and ``***
creates clutter on a label that is much better left with free space.***''

26

 Declaring contents without ``net weight'' or ``net mass'' is ``already the successful practice in Canada'' and has
been adopted by the National Conference on Weights and Measures.

27

 Further, the proposed Food and Drug Administration regulations for metric labeling of food products under the FPLA
also make the use of ``net weight'' or ``net mass'' optional.

Based upon the reasoning contained in the ten comments on this issue,

28

 the Commission has determined to make optional the use of the terms ``net weight'' and ``net mass.'' Thus, under the
amendment, a manufacturer or distributor need only state the weight or mass of the contents without using the qualifying
terms ``net weight'' or ``net mass'' (

e.g.

 ``453g (1 lb).'' However, the amendment to subsection (a) makes it clear that even where the terms are not used, the
quantity of contents declaration shall always declare the net quantity of contents.

 Section 500.6(a) also requires that the label on a consumer commodity bear the declaration of the net quantity of contents.
The Commission felt it appropriate to restate the point at 500.9(a) to avoid any confusion. 

</FOOTNOTE>


Subsection (b)(2) reflects the amendment to the FPLA which deletes the former avoirdupois (the system of weight based
upon the pound of 16 ounces) requirement that packages weighing one pound or more but less than four pounds disclose
both the total number of ounces and the number of pounds, with any remainder in ounces or common or decimal fractions
of the pound. Thus, under the old law, if a package weighed 3 and one-half pounds it would properly be labeled ``56 oz.
(3 lbs. 8 oz.).'' The new law requires only the expression of pounds and remainder of ounces, so that in the prior example
``3 lbs. 8 oz.'' would be sufficient. For weights greater than 1 pound but less than 4 pounds manufacturers will have
the option to include an additional statement of weight in ounces ``immediately adjacent'' to the required expression
in pounds, as subsection (b)(2) has been amended to allow this discretionary second expression of weight. Subsection
(b)(1) retains the requirement that disclosure be given exclusively in ounces for packages containing less than
one pound.
