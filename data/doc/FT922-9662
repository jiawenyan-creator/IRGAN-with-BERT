FT  06 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Late program selling causes
Dow to recede
Wall Street
US EQUITIES moved in a narrow range in quiet trading throughout most of the
day, before a late round of program selling pushed the Dow Jones Industrial
Average lower after closing at a record high on Monday, writes Karen Zagor
in New York.
The Dow ended 18.78 off at 3,359.35, but advances led declines at the close
by 934 to 779 after NYSE volume of 200m shares. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
edged down 0.07 to 417.40, but the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter
stocks gained 4.53 at 588.07.
Blue chip issues dominated the actives list on the NYSE, with PepsiCo
slipping Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 36 1/8 , American Express rising Dollars
1/4 to Dollars 22 1/2 and Sears Roebuck losing Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 43
3/4
Transportation issues were strong, with the Dow Jones Transportation Average
up 13.46 to 1,394.25.
AMR, parent of American Airlines, added Dollars 2 at Dollars 68 7/8 and UAL,
parent of United Airlines, rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 126 1/4 .
Delta Air Lines lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 59 3/4 . Shortly before the
close of trading, Moody's Investors Service said it was reviewing Delta for
a possible downgrade.
Cigna put on Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 52 1/2 . The insurance company's
first-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.48 a share, against 67 cents a year
earlier, were released after the close of trade on Monday.
Glaxo Holding's American Depositary Receipts rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 27
in heavy trading. The company's Zofran drug received marketing approval in
the UK for use in preventing and treating post-operative nausea.
The approval comes only days after UK regulators approved marketing of
Glaxo's migraine drug.
April car sales figures from Ford and Chrysler spurred active trading in
both issues. Chrysler turned in a 38 per cent jump in truck sales for the
month while car sales rose 5 per cent. The company said April was its best
month for total vehicle sales in nearly two years.
Ford's car sales advanced 5.5 per cent while truck sales rose 19.2 per cent.
Shares in Ford eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 44 7/8 and Chrysler dipped
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 18 5/8 .
ITT climbed Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 66 5/8 in active trading on news that
it is planning a new share repurchase programme for common and convertible
preferred for up to 25m equivalent common shares. The repurchase plan is
intended to help the company achieve a 15 per cent return on equity by 1996.
Santa Fe Pacific slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 12 7/8 on news that it had
filed for a secondary offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission
to allow beleaguered Canadian property developer Olympia &amp; York to sell its
18 per cent stake in the railway company.
Technology issues performed well on both the big board and in
over-the-counter trading. On the NYSE, IBM climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars
93 7/8 and Hewlett Packard Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 81 5/8 . In
over-the-counter trading, Microsoft moved ahead Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 116
1/2 but Apple Computer held steady at Dollars 60 1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks retraced early gains to end flat. An analyst said the market
is waiting for results from Olympia &amp; York's meeting in London with its
bankers, the end to the US Treasury refunding tomorrow, and Friday's US and
Canada unemployment figures for April.
The composite index closed just a point up at 3,364.5, while falls finally
outnumbered rises by 282 to 262. Volume was 23m shares. The gold group stood
out with a 2.7 per cent rise.
