FT  21 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Price claims plea is rejected -
Retailing
THE government yesterday rejected proposals by an advisory committee for
stricter curbs on shops which make misleading price claims and bogus special
offers.
It also said it wanted to limit the scope of proposed European Community
legislation against unfair contracts.
The government's decisions, spelled out in a speech by Mr Edward Leigh, the
consumer affairs minister, were criticised by the Retail Consortium, the
retail industry trade association, the government-backed National Consumer
Council and the Institute of Trading Standards Administration.
The committee set up by the Department of Trade and Industry to monitor the
largely voluntary scheme to prevent misleading price claims concluded that
it was being evaded. The committee recommended that the scheme be backed by
legally enforceable regulations.
Mr Leigh said that the government was not convinced that more detailed
regulations would be effective, although it was prepared to consider new
rules for the sale of tickets for entertainment and sporting events.
Mr Leigh said the government wanted EC efforts to protect consumers against
unfair contracts to be restricted primarily to transactions involving
monopolies and near-monopolies.
He also announced the publication of a discussion document setting out the
government's previously announced proposals to strengthen legislation on
consumer guarantees.
