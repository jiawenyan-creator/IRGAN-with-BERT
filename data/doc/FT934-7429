FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Travel agency sale lifts Hogg Robinson to
Pounds 14m
HOGG ROBINSON, the business travel, financial services and transport group,
yesterday reported that the sale of its travel agency chain to Airtours last
June helped boost half-yearly profits from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 14.3m.
A strong performance from the remaining business travel division outweighed
lacklustre performances in financial services and transport.
Turnover for the six months to September 30 fell to Pounds 78.8m (Pounds
89.3m). Operating profit from continuing operations rose to Pounds 5.55m
(Pounds 5.47m). The interim dividend goes up to 2.75p (2.6p), payable from
earnings of 17.28p (9.35p) per share.
The pre-tax profit figure includes a Pounds 6.7m net book gain from the sale
of the travel chain. The result includes only a three-month contribution of
Pounds 1.2m from the chain, compared with a six month figure of Pounds 3.45m
last year.
Mr Brian Perry, chairman, said the business travel division now had 34 of
the leading 100 UK quoted companies as customers. Business travel operating
profits increased to Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 900,000).
Operating profits at the financial services division were only marginally
ahead at Pounds 2.35m (Pounds 2.34m). The group said the division had
suffered as companies had deferred decisions on pensions while they awaited
the outcome of expected legislative changes. The prospect of change is,
however, expected to boost demand for short-term consultancy work.
Operating profits at the transport division fell to Pounds 2.5m (Pounds
3.17m). European trailer and port operations performed well, but air freight
suffered from low volumes and reduced margins.
The group added that it had experienced a marked lull in cargo movements to
the Falkland Islands, which had adversely affected yields on its regular
shipping services to the South Atlantic.
