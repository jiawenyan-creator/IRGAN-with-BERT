FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Ryanair on the upturn as profits emerge
RYANAIR, the Irish carrier owned by the sons of Mr Tony Ryan, chairman and
founder of GPA, the world's leading aircraft leasing group, made a small
profit last year - the first since its launch in 1986.
After accumulating losses of nearly IPounds 19m (Pounds 17.7m) since 1986,
last year's pre-tax surplus of IPounds 300,000 marks a significant turnround
for the airline, which has challenged Aer Lingus on the busy London-Dublin
route and helped bring down fares between the two countries during the past
six years. It lost IPounds 9m in 1990.
The profit reflects substantial restructuring and a clampdown on costs
during the past 18 months. The workforce has been cut by 15 per cent to
about 500 and Ryanair has dropped out of some unprofitable routes to
concentrate on its Dublin to London Stansted services.
Mr Conor Hayes, Ryanair's new chief executive, said the airline had been
boosted by its move last year from Luton to Stansted and it now intended to
expand its flights to Stansted this year.
It has also reached an agreement with American Airlines to tie in its
services from Stansted to Dublin with the US carrier's new Chicago to
Stansted flights this summer.
Mr Hayes said he expected Ryanair to show higher profits this year. 'If we
managed to make a small profit in a year when the industry lost money
because of the Gulf war and the recession, we should do even better this
year,' he said.
British Airways' decision to withdraw its services to Ireland last year had
a relatively modest impact on Ryanair's operations. 'Everybody got a piece
of the BA cake, but we got the smallest part of it,' Mr Hayes said.
Ryanair is to increase its fleet to 11 aircraft this spring by adding two
BAC 1-11 jets to its operations. It has also started a review of a fleet
renewal and replacement programme, but it only expects to take a decision
next year.
The airline, with revenues of IPounds 50m in 1991, carried 700,000
passengers last year, including 50,000 on charters, about the same as in
1990. However, Mr Hayes expected numbers to increase to 850,000 on scheduled
routes this year and to 125,000 on charter services.
