  [Text] Japan's Fuji Television Broadcast reported on 11 
April that North Korea and Iran agreed to establish a plant to 
produce NODONG No. 1 missiles in Iran. Such a fact was revealed 
in an interview with (Paul Beaver), a military commentator for 
JANE'S, while appearing in a feature program entitled "Areas of 
Dispute in the World." He said that this project is being 
promoted secretly under the password (Ronda-68). 
  When considering the level of the North Korean military 
force, Paul Beaver analyzed that North Korea has the ability to 
attack Seoul within 24 hours. He claimed that a response to the 
enemy by the United States through an immediate military 
intervention is inevitable for security on the Korean peninsula.
