Title:

 Diesel Fuel Quality Regulation Transfer Document Record Keeping Requirement (EPA ICR No. 1718.01). This ICR requests
approval of a new collection.


Abstract:

 On July 14, 1994 a revision to the Regulations of Fuels and Fuel Additives for Highway Diesel Fuel was published in the


Federal Register

 (59 FR 35854). The interim final rule continues to regulate on-highway diesel fuel, as published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 21, 1990 (54 FR 35276), by requiring that the fuel meet sulfur content standards, as well as standards for
cetane index or in the alternative for aromatic content. This revision, which goes into effect on October 1, 1994,
changes the language regarding the fuel dye color from blue to red. The revision requires that the fuel be free of visible
evidence of the dye Solvent Red 164 except as provided for tax exempt use in accordance with section 4082 of the Internal
Revenue Code. There will be a small portion of diesel fuel for use in motor vehicles that is both tax-exempt, requiring
it to be dyed red, and is also required to meet the on highway low sulfur diesel fuel requirements, requiring it to be
free of the visible evidence of the red dye. This overlap was addressed in EPA's July 14, 1994 revision to the fuel quality
standards by allowing the tax-exempt low sulfur fuel to contain visible evidence of the red dye provided that the fuel
meets the fuel quality standards and the shipments are accompanied by transfer documents indicating that the fuel
is for tax-exempt use only and meets the EPA diesel fuel quality standards. 
Product transfer documents are common standard industry papers that are produced by the transferor and accompany
each shipment to the transferee. This regulation will require the transferor of the fuel to provide the transferee
with documents to accompany each shipment of low sulfur fuel that has been dyed red. The documents are required to contain
language, or other such indication, verifying that the red dyed fuel meets the applicable fuel quality standards
and is for tax-exempt use. Copies of the documents must be retained in the possession of the transferor and the transferee
(shipment recipient) for a period of five years after the date of transfer. EPA will only request documentation from
the affected parties during inspections or other enforcement activities. EPA does not require that these documents
be routinely sent to the Agency for collection and review. EPA will use the documents to assist in enforcement of the
regulations. The documentation will assist the agency in ascertaining how to proceed when violations are found and
what party may be liable for enforcement action.
In summary, any party, including but not limited to, refiners, importers, distributors, resellers, carriers, retailers,
or wholesale purchaser consumers that use, or are the transferor or transferee of tax-exempt red dyed diesel fuel
for use in on-highway vehicles, must provide documents verifying that the fuel meets the applicable fuel quality
standards.

time for reviewing the required document, and filing and retaining the required documents.


Estimated Number of Respondents:

 4366.


Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent:

 1.


Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents:

 The documents will not be routinely collected by the Agency. The documents must be retained by the transferor and the
transferee for a period of five years after the date of transfer and must be made available to the Administrator or an
Agency official upon request.
