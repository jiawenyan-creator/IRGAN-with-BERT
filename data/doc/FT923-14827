FT  06 JUL 92 / Letter: Macedonia, the classic confusion and the needs of
ethnic minorities (1)
Sir, Edward Mortimer ('A Greek tragi-comedy, July 1), whose articles are
generally well written, seems this time to be running in circles on the
Yugoslavian issue and the misuse of the name Macedonia. He has fallen victim
of a classic confusion, in being unable to draw a line between nationalism,
as he describes it, and old fashioned, despicable, communist propaganda.
Tito managed to convince a generation of Slavs in southern Yugoslavia that
they are the descendants of Alexander the Great. That was a great lie, as
any serious university don will tell you.
Surely, in the new Europe, which admits some sincerity among its tribes in
the form of glasnost, open government, accountable government, etc, the word
Macedonia must be allowed to remain a more vaguely defined region across
nation states rather than be adulterated as the name of one nation state and
perpetuate an abusive lie of an old, dictatorial, communist regime.
