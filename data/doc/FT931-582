FT  29 MAR 93 / French Elections: Socialists appear deaf to appeal
SOCIALIST supporters appeared to have ignored an appeal to mobilise and
reduce the scale of their party's defeat in the second round of the National
Assembly elections yesterday, agencies report from Paris.
The Interior Ministry said total turn-out was 53.78 per cent by 5pm compared
with 56.11 per cent at the same time in last Sunday's first round.
The Socialists had appealed to people who skipped voting last week to
contain the expected rout by the opposition conservatives.
The abstention rate last week was 31 per cent. Analysts said significantly
lower abstention this week could help the Socialists slightly.
In the first round, the opposition Union pour la France (UPF) alliance
scored 39.5 per cent of the vote and won 80 seats outright. It is forecast
to win as many as 500 of the 577 seats in the National Assembly. The
Socialists crashed to 17.6 per cent of the vote last week and are expected
to win as few as 40 seats in parliament.
The Socialists had called for the backing from the left and the 31 per cent
of voters who sat out the first round to prevent a right-wing takeover
turning France into a 'banana republic'.
Surrounded by photographers and journalists, President Francois Mitterrand
cast his ballot in the central village of Chateau-Chinon. He was to fly back
to Paris by helicopter in time to watch the results come in. Voting went
largely without incident under clear skies around the country. A false bomb
alert interrupted balloting for about 20 minutes at the village of
Ille-sur-Tet in the Pyrenees mountains.
