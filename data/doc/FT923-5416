FT  01 SEP 92 / International Company News: Macy's offers 5-year plan
RH Macy, the bankrupt New York-based department store group, has provided
creditors with an outline business plan for a five-year period, writes Nikki
Tait in New York.
The company said the detailed implementation plans would be prepared during
the next two months, and that financial projections were also still being
developed.
However, part of the plan relied on cost-reduction, 'refining pricing to
balance everyday competitiveness with appropriate sales promotions', and a
more focused approach to merchandise categories.
Meanwhile, Ames Department Stores, operating under the protection of Chapter
11 of the US bankruptcy code, has received court approval for the extension
of a Dollars 200m financing facility. The new debtor-in-possession facility
will run through to October 30, 1993.
