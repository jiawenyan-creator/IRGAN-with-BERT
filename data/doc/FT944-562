FT  28 DEC 94 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System
The pre-Christmas trading week saw the D-Mark climb above the Irish punt in
the EMS grid. The French franc fell below the Danish krone as political
uncertainty undermined the currency. The gap between strongest and weakest
currencies widened noticeably as political worries in Italy (outside the
grid) and Spain as well as France encouraged a move into safe-haven
currencies.
