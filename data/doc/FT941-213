FT  31 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Russian deals fall short of US hopes
Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, yesterday announced a series of
deals between US and Russian companies which fell short of his hopes  - but
which heralded US investment 'greatly in excess of the present Dollars 1bn.'
His most significant breakthrough was in achieving a lifting of a 50 per
cent tariff on aerospace products. This allowed the Russian private air
company TransAero to import two Boeing 757s on a lease deal it had
previously threatened to cancel because of the new tariff imposed on March
15. The company is also negotiating the leasing of a two more Boeing 757s.
In talks with Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian premier, Mr Brown said he
extracted a promise Russia would not impose tariffs retrospectively on deals
already signed and would review all new tariffs imposed this month. However,
he failed to get lifted an export tariff of Dollars 5 per barrel of oil.
The tariff threatens to make many oil joint ventures between foreign and
Russian companies unprofitable and jeopardises a deal on Sakhalin offshore
reserves.
