FT  13 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Vietnamese rice exports up 30
per cent
VIETNAMESE RICE exports rose by about 30 per cent last year to 1.4m tonnes,
consolidating the country's position as the world's third largest rice
exporter after Thailand and the US, official figures show.
Total Vietnamese rice production in 1992 rose by 1.6m tonnes to 21.5m
despite the floods that damaged crops in some areas, according to an
official newspaper.
The figures suggest that Vietnam has overcome problems caused by the
disruption in fertiliser supplies that followed the collapse of the Soviet
Union, once Hanoi's principal foreign backer and aid donor.
The report in the Sunday Vietnam News said farmers had boosted rice
production by planting high-yield varieties and using more modern farming
techniques, as well as by drawing on government credit lines to the tune of
about Dollars 100m.
More than half the loans went to farmers in the fertile southern Mekong
delta, and they produced about 11m tonnes of the year's output.
