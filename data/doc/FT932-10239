FT  10 MAY 93 / Observer: Some consolation
Asil Nadir may not have many assets to which he can lay claim at the moment.
But since jumping bail, he has perhaps done something to benefit Polly
Peck's creditors and shareholders.
It can hardly be pure coincidence that the venue from which he conducted his
press conference for the world's media on Friday was Cyprus's Jasmine Court
hotel, and since his appearance was postponed several times, the assembled
hacks no doubt took solace in increasing the bar takings.
Oddly enough, it appears that the Jasmine Court is owned by a company in
which the administrators of Polly Peck are claiming a controlling interest.
