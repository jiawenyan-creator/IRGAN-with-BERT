FT  03 JUN 94 / Heseltine rules out easing of BT ban
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday flatly
rejected any easing of restrictions which prevent British Telecommunications
from using its network to provide entertainment services.
As the Labour party used the launch of an industrial competitiveness
document to pledge it would scrap the ban, Mr Heseltine insisted that any
such move would represent a 'grave breach of trust' by the government.
Accusing Labour of irresponsible opposition politics, he said the
restrictions had been introduced to allow other companies to catch up with
BT's monopoly when it was privatised. Competitors had invested billions of
pounds because they could rely on the 'word' of the government. He added:
'Frankly, it would be the gravest possible breach of integrity if we were to
go back on that.'
The ban, which applies at least until 1998, was imposed to encourage cable
companies to invest in telecommunications networks in competition with BT.
The cable companies say the ban is essential to ensure the viability of
their planned Pounds 6bn investment during the next five years.
BT has argued that the decision, taken in 1991, has been overtaken by events
and threatens the viability of a nationwide telecommunications
'superhighway' based on fibre-optic networks. It appears willing to invest
Pounds 15bn in such a programme but needs the assurance of profits from the
entertainment sector, at present dominated by US cable companies. Labour
would scrap the ban in return for a BT undertaking to participate in a new
'nationwide communications link-up'.
