FOYT SAYS HE'LL QUIT AT END OF '91 
More than a half-century of racing will come to an end next year for A. J. 
Foyt. 
Foyt, the all-time winningest Indy-car driver, said Tuesday night he'll make 
one last run in the Indianapolis 500, "finish the 1991 season and then call it 
quits." 
"I hate that I've got to call it to an end," Foyt said. "But there comes a time 
in everybody's life that it's over with." 
Foyt, 55, is recuperating at his Houston home from injuries sustained in a race 
crash Sept. 23 at Elkhart Lake, Wis. He broke and dislocated bones in both legs 
and feet. 
"If I get back 100% and finish 1991, I've had an enjoyable career," he said. 
Foyt had earlier hinted at retirement but had not made an announcement. 
"Yes, this will be the last time," Foyt said of next year's 500. 
Foyt, who has won four Indy 500s, said the accident spoiled his plan to wait 
until next year before announcing the 1991 season would be his last. 
Foyt, who won the Indianapolis 500 in 1961, 1964, 1967 and 1977, is winless on 
the Indy-car circuit since a victory in the Pocono 500 in 1981. 
His father built him his first race car when Foyt was 3. He won his first 
midget car race in 1953. 
With career earnings of $5.5 million, Foyt finished his 34th season with 67 
Indy-car career victories and 53 poles. He is second to Mario Andretti in 
poles. 
Foyt's career has not been limited to Indy cars. He is the only driver ever to 
win the Indianapolis 500, stock-car racing's Daytona 500 and endurance racing's 
24 Hours of Le Mans. 
He has won races in 18 different seasons and has nine victories in races of 500 
miles, both Indy-car records.
