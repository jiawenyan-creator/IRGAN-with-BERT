FT  07 FEB 94 / SIB stands by pensions survey
The Securities and Invest-ments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog,
yesterday defended the methods it used in a recent survey of pension
transfers.
SIB had been criticised by Fimbra, one of the self-regulatory bodies
responsible for overseeing sales agents, over its use of a list of Fimbra
members conducting pensions transfer business.
Mr Godfrey Jillings, chief executive of Fimbra, which oversees independent
financial advisers, said the SIB study, which was carried out by accountants
KPMG Peat Marwick, included a disproportionate number of firms where there
were problems. He said: 'We deliberately included at least one firm where we
knew there were problems with eight out of 11 files.'
However, SIB and KPMG yesterday said the selection of firms was completely
random. KPMG had reviewed files at companies chosen from a list supplied by
Fimbra which included the name of every member which had carried out pension
transfer business.
They said that remarks by Mr Jillings, that 'in the Fimbra element of the
sample bad firms had a higher than random element of being selected', were
untrue.
SIB said it had asked Fimbra last summer to determine which of its members
conducted pension transfer business and learned that 1,500 of its 6,500
members did so.
Mr Jillings said the adverse publicity had created severe difficulties for
some independent financial advisers. Insurers had raised premiums for
personal indemnity insurance by between 300 per cent and 400 per cent.
