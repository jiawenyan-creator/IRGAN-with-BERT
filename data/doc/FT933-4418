FT  09 SEP 93 / Menem's drive for new term falters
TENSE negotiations behind closed doors in the Argentine Senate continued
yesterday afternoon after President Carlos Menem's attempt to amend
Argentina's constitution faltered on Tuesday writes John Barham from Buenos
Aires.
Mr Menem wants to scrap the 1853 constitution's ban on successive
presidential terms and run for re-election when his six-year term ends in
July 1995. To do so he must first win a two-thirds majority in both houses
of Congress.
But on Tuesday, the first day of debate in the Senate, two members of the
ruling Peronist party denied Mr Menem the majority by refusing to back the
amendment. The president later cut short an official visit to Brazil.
Senator Jose Bordon, who has already declared he will seek the Peronist
presidential nomination, said on Tuesday he would only support the amendment
if the government established a consensus with the opposition Radical party.
Senator Antonio Cafiero, who lost the Peronist presidential nomination to Mr
Menem in 1988, also rebelled for the same reason.
The Peronists hold 30 of the Senate's 48 seats and had enlisted the support
of two independent senators to reach the required 32 votes. Even if the
government wins the Senate vote, achieving a two-thirds majority in the
Chamber of Deputies will be more difficult.
