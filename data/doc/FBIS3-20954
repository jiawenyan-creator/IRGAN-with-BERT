  [Text] The Commission has selected 194 new projects under 
its scientific and technological cooperation scheme with the 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe: Albania, Bulgaria, the 
Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, 
Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia. The projects will involve a 
total of 666 partners and will receive ECU31.4 million 
assistance in 1993. 
  A large number of projects have already been supported by 
the 
Commission since the scheme was launched and these absorbed the 
full amount of ECU55 million earmarked for 1992. 
  Those projects consisted in particular in the award of 2,531 
study grants to researchers from the East, enabling them to 
spend an average of three months in some of the Community's 
leading laboratories and to acquire fresh knowhow to be put to 
use on their return home, while establishing valuable contacts 
for the development of networks in the future. Support was also 
given for scientific conferences, seminars and workshops and for 
projects to develop pan-European scientific networks and to 
enable Central and Eastern Europe to participate in Community 
research programmes or COST projects (European cooperation in 
the field of scientific and technical research).
