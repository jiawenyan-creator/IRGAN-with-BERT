YOU CAN HELP!: STOCK MARKET THROWS READER FOR A LOSS 
Allison Morency of Temple City would like to find a copy of the Stock Market 
game, made by Whitman. Can you perhaps share a source or two with her, or will 
Morency be unable to bear up under the knowledge that her request may be just 
so much bull? 
To keep her sofas spotless, Nora Salni of Toluca Lake is looking for something 
called Mohawk Zip Clean No. 172001. She says the man who recently cleaned the 
sofas gave her some of that product, but she's used it all and can't find it in 
any store. Can you get Salni off the spot, or will she have to take this lying 
down because somebody might be doing her dirt? 
Because Anna Carlton of Las Vegas can't find women's Daniel Green bedroom 
slippers in the Felice style, size 8 1/2-AA, in her hometown, she's gambling 
that somebody out here might know of a source. Can you help before Carlton puts 
her foot down, or is it just not in the cards for her to get off on the right 
foot? 
George Paul of Hollywood has been searching for a car coat, which is a 
lightweight three-quarter-length topcoat and is not to be confused with a 
fleece-lined stadium coat worn to football games. Can you help, or might Paul 
just as well button up because he's been caught short once more? 
Reader-to-Reader Help Line: Margot at (213) 699-6898 has lost the linguine die 
that comes with the Osrow X1000 pasta machine, and the manufacturer has gone 
out of business. Please help so that Margot won't have to roam around too much 
before her next Italian dinner . . . For the man in her life, Toni at (714) 
862-3081 is looking for a decoder ring, the kind found years ago in cereal 
boxes. Please try to help out, and perhaps Toni will be able to exchange that 
ring for a diamond. . . . Robert at (818) 334-6677 would love to get his hands 
on one of the limited-edition, golden-brown authentic fur felt hats sold in 
connection with "Raiders of the Lost Ark." See what you can do, if only to make 
sure that Robert doesn't lose his head over this.

Louis Hogan of Whittier, who wants somebody to repair a Pachinko game, should 
soon be rolling. And so should Juanita Damiani of Sun Valley, whose Pachinko 
machine is also on the blink. Patricia A. Bales of San Pedro says Link &amp; 
Pan Enterprises, 24412 S. Main St., Carson, (213) 835-5400, repairs Pachinko 
machines and sells parts. 
For Aiko Yamashita and the many other readers who've been looking for pant 
stretchers, we have a lot of sources, but most of them are mail-order firms. 
The only local store mentioned was Pic 'N' Save (by Mary Jane Roberts of 
Torrance, N. L. Brice of Eagle Rock and Peggy Waters of Westlake Village). 
These are the mail-order companies, supplied to us by about 30 readers: Harriet 
Carter, Department 19, North Wales, Pa. 19455 ($5.98 a pair); Taylor Gifts, 355 
E. Conestoga Road, P.O. Box 7000, Wayne, Pa. 19093-7000 ($6.98 a pair); Walter 
E. Drake &amp; Sons, 29 Drake Building, Colorado Springs, Colo. 80940 ($8.98 a 
pair); Miles Kimball (they call them "pant creasers"), 41 W. 8th Ave., Oshkosh, 
Wis. 54906 ($4.39 a pair); and Hanover House, Hanover, Pa. 17333-0002 ($4.88 a 
pair when on sale). 
Ruth Blosser of Santa Barbara, who was looking for a square omelet pan, did not 
quite lay an egg in her search. Ollie La More of Los Angeles says the Chef's 
Catalog, 3215 Commercial Ave., Northbrook, Ill. 60062, lists an oval skillet in 
various colors for $59.99. 
Perhaps Ralph Holland of Venice, who wanted a chewing-tobacco cutter, will soon 
have something to chew on. The Cornucopia antique and gift shop in Beaumont, 
(714) 845-1411, may still have one of those cutters in stock. And an Encino 
reader has a very old, very heavy (and probably very expensive) cutter that 
might be of interest to a serious collector. Anyone who is serious about this 
item should send us a stamped, self-addressed envelope. 
Hain cannot answer mail personally but will, space permitting, respond in this 
column to readers who need -- or have -- helpful information. Write (do not 
telephone) to You Can Help!, You section, the Times, Times Mirror Square, Los 
Angeles 90053.
