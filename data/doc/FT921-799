FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Boustead falls into the red in second half
BOUSTEAD, the specialist manufacturing, technical services and distribution
company, fell into the red in the second half of 1991.
Full year pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 5.21m to Pounds 886,000 following
interim profits of Pounds 1.04m.
Sir Thomas Macpherson, chairman, blamed the difficult economic conditions,
particularly in the UK.
At the same time the company announced the sale by Bousteadco Singapore, its
64.5 per cent owned offshoot, of its shipping and hose coupling
manufacturing businesses to a Malaysian group. In aggregate the result was
an extraordinary gain to Boustead of about Pounds 600,000 and a reduction on
borrowings of Pounds 1.3m which would have cut year end gearing to about 60
per cent.
A breakdown of the pre-tax figure showed lower results in all sectors. The
worst outcomes were in manufacturing, which fell from Pounds 2.35m to Pounds
124,000, and in transmission products distribution with a loss of Pounds
716,000 against profits of Pounds 27,000.
With earnings of 0.6p (4.2p) a lower final dividend of 0.35p makes a total
of 0.7p (1.65p).
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.64m (Pounds 2.63 credit) left the loss
for the year at Pounds 1.7m, (Pounds 4.33m profit).
