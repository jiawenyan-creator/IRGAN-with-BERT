BOARD GROUP TO SEEK CONTROL OF OAK INDUSTRIES 
A group that includes former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman 
Roderick M. Hills, former U.S. Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson and San 
Diego Economic Development Corp. Chairman George W. Leiszhas begun a proxy 
fight aimed at unseating five of San Diego-based Oak Industries' eight board 
members. 
The dissident group will sponsor a board majority that would be "independent" 
of current Oak Chairman E. L. McNeely, according to a prepared release issued 
Tuesday by Hills. 
Hills, nominated to Oak's board by McNeely in 1985, voiced "frustration" with 
the company's inability to report consistent operating profits and said it left 
him with "no alternative" except to challenge McNeely for control of the 
company. McNeely was out of town and unavailable for comment Tuesday. 
Oak, a high-flying media conglomerate during the late 1970s, fell upon hard 
times in the early 1980s and reported $300 million in net losses between 1981 
and 1987. Since becoming chairman in 1984, McNeely has been trying to 
orchestrate a turnaround at the troubled company, which now basically is an 
electronic-components maker. 
Hills initiated the proxy fight because "Oak keeps on raising cash and losing 
it through operations," according to a source associated with the dissident 
group. "For the first time in some time, Oak Industries shareholders will have 
a real choice, will have something to say" about Oak's stock, which has traded 
at about $1 for more than a year.
