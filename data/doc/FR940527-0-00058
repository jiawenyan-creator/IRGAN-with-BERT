 

Nevada agrees to review all State hazardous waste permits that have been issued under State law prior to the effective
date of this authorization. Nevada agrees to then modify or revoke and reissue such permits as necessary to require
compliance with the revised State program. The modifications or revocation and reissuance will be scheduled in the
annual State Grant Work Plan. 

Nevada is not being authorized to operate any portion of the hazardous waste program on Indian lands. 



C. Decision 



I conclude that Nevada's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, Nevada is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised. 

Nevada is now responsible for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and carrying
out the aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program applications, subject to the limitations of the
Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98616, November 8, 1984) (``HSWA''). Nevada also
has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section
3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under section 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. 



Compliance With Executive Order 12866 



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12866.




Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Nevada's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for
handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
