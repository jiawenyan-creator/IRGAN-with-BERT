FT  20 DEC 94 / ANC officials deny racism
African National Congress officials have reaffirmed the party's commitment
to non-racism and denied reports that delegates to its national conference
are calling for the party to pursue an agenda which gives priority to black
needs. Mr Mac Maharaj, transport minister, and other senior members of a
commission deciding the party's strategy and tactics, said speculation that
the ANC would end its reconciliatory policy towards whites and devote itself
to blacks was unfounded.
The 11 commissions formalising party policy on issues ranging from next
year's local government elections to foreign affairs will present their
findings to the party plenary today when election results for the party's
six top posts will also be announced. President Nelson Mandela and deputy
president Thabo Mbeki are almost certain to be elected to the presidency and
deputy presidency of the party respectively.
