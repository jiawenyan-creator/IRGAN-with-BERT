SHAKESPEARE NOT DESCRIBED AS 'UN-AMERICAN' ON TAPE; 
THEATER: COUNCILMAN LITTRELL SAID WORKS ARE 'NOT AMERICAN,' TAPE RECORDING OF 
MEETING INDICATES. 
City Councilman Raymond T. Littrell did not say that the works of William 
Shakespeare are "un-American," as a Grove Shakespeare Festival official 
asserted, during recent public debate over city support of the financially 
troubled theater troupe. 
Thomas Bradac, producing artistic director of the Festival, had told The Times 
that he was "surprised to hear that Littrell believes Shakespeare and the 
classics are un-American." 
A review of a tape recording of the City Council meeting in question revealed 
no use of the term "un-American." Littrell did note that Shakespeare is not 
American and that he believes the troupe should concentrate on American 
culture. 
Littrell, calling for clarification, said he believes the distinction is 
important because he feels that "un-American" connotes subversion, and "I don't 
believe that people who go to Shakespeare are that," he said. 
"I wasn't quoting him," Bradac said yesterday. "I'm restating what he said. In 
essence, that's what he said," the director maintained. JIM TORTOLANO
