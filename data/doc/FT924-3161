FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Tomkins likely to have no net debt after
RHM buy
TOMKINS, the conglomerate, is likely to end up with no net debt after its
Pounds 935m acquisition of Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling, baking and
grocery products company, according to the company's advisers.
Costs relating to the likely closure of a number of bakeries will, however,
leave the group with some net gearing. Before its move on RHM, Tomkins had
net cash of about Pounds 150m.
Tomkins said yesterday that as of Monday it had received valid acceptances
representing about 61.97 per cent of the RHM ordinary shares. The company
had also bought 22 per cent of the shares for cash during the offer period.
RHM shareholders representing some 44 per cent of acceptances opted for
Tomkins cash alternative to the ordinary offer. Some 37 per cent elected for
the all share offer while 18 per cent accepted the ordinary offer which
involved a split of cash and shares.
The advisers said the pattern of acceptances had left Tomkins 'broadly
neutral' with no cash or net debt and in line with what it was hoping for at
the outset of the bid.
Yesterday's announcement suggested shareholders have cast aside their
immediate worries about the bid. Early in the bid, concern that Tomkins had
bitten off more than it could chew had helped push the shares close to the
200p price of the rights issue that is partly financing the deal.
Yesterday, however, Tomkins shares responded to the level of acceptances by
jumping 7 1/2 p to 238 1/2 p. This was some 10p above the price at which
Tomkins' share offers was worth more than the cash alternative.
BZW, the company's advisers, said it had sent notice of the second
instalment of the rights issue to Tomkins shareholders.
Tomkins is unlikely to make any early statement on the number of RHM's
bakeries it is likely to close or the level of related acquisition
provisions.
