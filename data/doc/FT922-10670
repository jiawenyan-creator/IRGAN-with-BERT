FT  30 APR 92 / People: New lives for Chalmers, Shaw and Thoresen
Two big life assurance companies have appointed new chairmen.
National Mutual Life, based in Hitchin, Herts, has appointed Norman Chalmers
(left) to succeed Sandy Pease, who is retiring after 17 years as chairman
and 29 years as a director.
National Mutual is a small life office, and very much a 'niche' player - it
produces only pensions, rather than general life insurance products, and it
markets them exclusively through independent brokers and advisers.
It has a reputation as one of the more traditional offices and with
Chalmers' background this seems unlikely to change much; he is a freeman of
the City of London and is on the Court of the Worshipful Company of
Gardeners. He trained at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, and went
on to serve as an officer in the Black Watch, before qualifying as an
accountant.
Britannia Life, which also has a new chairman, is a very different animal.
The change in personnel reflects a move to integrate Britannia Life more
fully into Britannia Building Society, of which it is a wholly owned
subsidiary.
Calum MacLeod, the out-going chairman, steps down on the completion of his
five-year term. When he started, the company was a mutual society, called FS
Assurance. However, he will continue as deputy chairman of Britannia Life,
which is building a new headquarters in Glasgow.
Meanwhile, the new chairman will be Michael Shaw (centre), managing director
of the main building society. The aim is to establish 'a more direct
reporting line to the society's management and board'.
And at Royal Life International a replacement has been found for Richard
Gough, the previous managing director lured away to set up Sun Life's new
offshore life company.
Otto Thoresen (right), 36, will be RLI's new chief executive. Of Norwegian
extraction, but with a Scottish accent, he is currently managing director of
Royal Life on the mainland, and has previously worked in marketing for Abbey
Life and Scottish Equitable.
Thoresen will be based in RLI's impressive, if slightly incongruous, new
head office just outside Castletown at the southern tip of the Isle of Man.
It is the largest life company on the island, with 170 employees, and the
appointment of a man with a marketing background may signal further
determination to find new outlets for its products. At present it has many
customers in the Middle and Far East, but it is keen to move further away
from the company's traditional exatriate market, and also reduce its
dependence on one-off single premium products.

The media planning and buying group Aegis has announced the death on Tuesday
evening of Francis Gross, co-chairman and one of the two founders of Carat,
the main Aegis operating subsidiary. He would have been 57 yesterday.
One of the international giants of the media buying business, Gross joined
his brother Gilbert, who first set up Carat in 1969. Peter Scott, chairman
of Aegis, said: 'Francis was one of the innovators and founders not just of
Carat but of the European industry of media planning and buying. He was a
man of immense inspiration and will be greatly missed.'
Awarded the Legion d'Honneur in January 1989, Francis Gross took a leading
role in Carat until some six months ago, when cancer was diagnosed. His
major achievement in Carat was not simply to have built a successful company
but to have extended that success internationally.
