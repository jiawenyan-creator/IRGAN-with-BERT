  [Text] CONTACT INFORMATION AGENCY reports that the Georgian 
head of state's decree on guarding oil pipelines passing through 
Georgian territory and securing order at oil-prospecting sites 
has entitled the Georgian Interior Ministry and the petroleum 
department to begin implementing the decree immediately. An 
agreement has been signed between these two offices according to 
which the petroleum department has purchased appropriate 
equipment and firearms for the Interior Ministry. First Deputy 
Interior Minister General Gela Lanchava has taken personal 
responsibility in supervising the guard over the pipelines and 
sites. [passage omitted] 
  By the implementation of the decree, oil output will rise 
from 30 to 150 tonnes per day. The area guarded is being 
extended and consequently the quantity of oil extracted will 
also increase. In the very near future, Australian, American, 
and British firms will start oil-prospecting and geological 
surveying as well as the construction of small oil refineries.
