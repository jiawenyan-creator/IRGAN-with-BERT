  [Text] In the course of the day, President Izetbegovic 
also met with Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin to discuss the same 
issues. Here is what the president told correspondents about the 
content of the talks: 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] It is (?particularly) 
interesting that Mr. Churkin said that even Russia supports -- 
so he says -- the lifting of the Sarajevo siege, that it 
supports this position. I took the chance to warn Mr. Churkin 
of the offensive, the Serb offensive up there in Bihac, [words 
indistinct], and I asked him to use his influence to immediately 
stop the offensive. He promised to do what he could to have the 
attack stopped. [end recording]
