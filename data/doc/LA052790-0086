DESIRE IN L.A. BY MARTHA CLARE RONK 
Pull away from the map of the mind sprawls 
over the whole of city streets, L.A. extends 
our own errands and where we have to get to, you 
are far away, left at corners where one awning tears 
in the once-a-year wind, where the wind blows 
the trees as we stand over the open grave, 
the one we love; planes taking off from the airport. 
Waves turn to go out to sea, 
a whole city expanding like the universe, 
each drive up canyons, each centrifugal wind reaching 
beyond what used to be the limits of a city 
and none of us can stop 
pushing beyond our time, our money, the need 
for some outskirts of a city already wholly outskirts, 
reaching for, like erotic desire, the nether parts. 
Mannered fingers and necks elongate beyond themselves, 
skin hurts drying in the wind, 
and waiting to find transparent expansion 
into the upper reaches of not even belief, 
but craving our own unbelief 
and that image of another's skirt 
lifted by the warm, slightly soiled air of an open grate.
