FT  03 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Victoria woos mining companies
THE STATE of Victoria failed to reach its full potential during Australia's
gold rush in the 1980s  - when the country's annual output jumped from 17 to
about 200 tonnes  - mainly because of its reputation as a place to be
avoided by mining and exploration companies.
This was suggested yesterday by Mr Keith Bowen, general manager project
facilitation for Victoria's Department of Manufacturing and Industry
Development, who recalled that the state was Australia's leading gold
producer in the late 1800s.
Mr Bowen is part of a team in Europe trying to attract mining and
down-stream processing companies to Victoria after its new Mining Act which
comes into effect in July. The Act is completely new, not a revision or
amendment, and has been designed 'to foster and encourage the mining
industry', he said.
Victoria's mineral production, including petroleum, coal and quarry
products, last year was worth about ADollars 5bn. After these three items,
gold was the most valuable, with output of 75,000 troy ounces worth ADollars
33m, followed by koalin, ADollars 13.4m; other clays ADollars 7.2m; and
glass sand Dollars 3.9m.
Mr Bowen said Victoria had one of the world's most economically important
areas in the Latrobe Valley which contained about 4bn barrels of oil, 14
trillion cubic feet of gas and 30bn tonnes of readily winnable brown coal.
The state currently produced no base metals in spite of being on the same
geological formation from which metals were being mined in Tasmania and New
South Wales.
Victoria's low-cost energy made it an attractive location for
energy-intensive mineral processing activities, such as the aluminium
smelting at Point Henry and Portland. The state hoped to attract companies
to upgrade mineral sands, to produce magnesium, to smelt nickel, fuse
minerals and make specialised ceramic materials.
