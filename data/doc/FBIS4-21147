Caracas on 6 April] 
  [Text] Given the distorted reports transmitted by certain 
foreign news agencies and subsequently published in a local 
newspaper on 5 April on the "Annual Report on the Drug Control 
Strategy at the International Level" presented by the U.S. State 
Department to the U.S. Congress, which lists Venezuela among the 
leading drug producing countries and countries used most often 
as transshipment points for drugs, the Foreign Ministry has done 
an in- depth evaluation of the aforementioned report and states 
the following: 
  1. The report and list refer to countries, Venezuela 
included, that are victims of the drug problem and which have 
cooperated fully with the United States or adopted their own 
measures to achieve full compliance with the goals and 
objectives of the 1988 UN Convention Against the Illegal Traffic 
of Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances. The preparation of 
the aforementioned report is foreseen in the U.S. Foreign Aid 
Law and allows a confirmation of the various categories of 
countries affected by the drug problem that may continue to 
receive U.S. aid. 
  2. As the report indicates, Venezuela is one of the 
countries that has offered exemplary cooperation in the struggle 
against drugs. The U.S. State Department recognizes this when 
it admits that "Venezuela is not a narcotics producing country; 
it is only used as a transshipment point for drugs going from 
Colombia to the United States and Europe." This categorically 
denies the negative reports spread by certain biased foreign 
news agencies that included only certain parts of the report in 
question. 
  3. Moreover, the U.S. Government recognizes the efforts made 
by Venezuela, a country that has endorsed the 1988 UN Convention 
Against the Illegal Traffic of Narcotics and Psychotropic 
Substances that was ratified in 1991. Furthermore, our country 
has signed 23 bilateral agreements that include most of Latin 
America, the Caribbean, and North America as well as several 
Western European countries in coordinated efforts and policies 
for the prevention, control, and repression of the illegal 
traffic of narcotics and psychotropic substances. In addition, 
on a multilateral level, Venezuela is part of the 1961 Single 
Narcotics Convention, the 1971 protocol which modifies this 
convention, the South American Accord on Narcotics and 
Psychotropic Substances (ASEP), and the Lara Bonilla Accord 
among Cartagena Agreement member countries. It is also actively 
working on programs of the Inter-American Commission for the 
Control of Drug Abuse (CICAD/OAS). 
  4. Likewise, Venezuela is a among the pioneer Latin American 
countries which promulgated the 1984 Basic Law on Narcotics and 
Psychotropic Substances, which was revised in 1993 to include 
almost all the Model Regulations for the Control of Precursors 
and Chemical Substances, Machines, and Elements prepared by the 
CICAD. Moreover, the current law on this issue was adapted to 
the terms of the 1988 Vienna Convention. 
  5. Within this same context, and as acknowledged by the U.S. 
State Department report, the Venezuelan Government's struggle 
against the illegal traffic of drugs has been permanent and 
systematic. Referring to this issue, measures have been taken 
to equip the state's security organizations, and special 
financial investigation divisions have been created in the 
Technical Judicial Police (PTJ), Directorate of Intelligence and 
Prevention Services (DISIP), and the Armed Forces of National 
Cooperation. 
  6. In addition, seminars and conferences have been held in 
Caracas this year to examine the drug problem, including the one 
recently held by the CICAD on the "Use of Capital Resulting From 
the Illegal Traffic of Drugs," and the first Latin American 
Congress of Drug Experts, under the auspices of the U.S. Embassy 
and the Jose Felix Ribas Foundation. Furthermore, the country 
was visited by the executive secretary and assistant secretary 
of the International Narcotics Supervision Board (JIFE) on 21-25 
March for a firsthand look at the drug situation in Venezuela. 
Those individuals expressed their recognition of the work being 
done in this country. 
  7. As proof of the permanent struggle against that scourge, 
the state's security organizations seized 3,405.197 kg of drugs 
in 1993: cocaine (1,704.883 kg); bazuko (1,160.898 kg); 
marijuana (526.26 kg), heroin (12.686 kg), and hashish (0.500 
kg). Moreover, 12,309 people were arrested as a result of those 
seizures and Police operations; and charges were filed for drug 
consumption (10), drug possession (9,931), and drug trafficking 
(2,368). 
  8. To conclude, the Venezuela Government wishes to reassert 
its firm decision to continue the struggle against drugs, and it 
avails itself of the occasion to request the same cooperation 
from the other countries of the international community, 
particularly the government of the United States of America, a 
country with which we have excellent relations of friendship and 
cooperation. Venezuela is not a drug producer but it is 
suffering the consequences of the illegal trafficking of 
narcotics and psychotropic substances, particularly the 
laundering of dollars generated by drug trafficking activities. 
It is time to face the problem together, not through a 
misrepresentation of the facts or slanderous charges, but with 
serious efforts focused on strengthening the actions against 
this terrible scourge.
