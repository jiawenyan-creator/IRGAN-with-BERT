  [Text] The president of the Republic, General Gnassingbe 
Eyadema, and Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh this morning 
held a meeting at the president's Lome II residence. The talks 
between the two men lasted for more than an hour. This was the 
first meeting between the two leaders of the executive branch of 
government after the second round of the legislative elections. 
  Provisional results from 19 constituencies out of the 24 
whose candidates were neck and neck were released yesterday by 
the National Electoral Commission. The commission then 
submitted the partial results to the Supreme Court, which has a 
maximum of 15 days to proclaim the final results, after ruling 
on all cases of litigation.
