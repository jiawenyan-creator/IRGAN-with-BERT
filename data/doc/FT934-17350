FT  01 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Question of consistency
Sir, The west's support for Boris Yeltsin's dissolution of parliament
('West's best bet' September 29) is based on the idea that this body and the
constitution were inherited from the Soviet Union.
When the disbanded parliament is replaced by a democratically elected
legislative body and a new constitution adopted, Russia can assert it has
domestically renounced the old Soviet system. Such a declaration implies a
similar repudiation externally. Russia can no longer claim a special sphere
of influence in the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. The
west should only support a consistency in Russian domestic and foreign
policy.
