FT  01 JUN 94 / 'Only 24% of dole leavers' go to jobs
Fewer than a quarter of those leaving the unemployment register are going
into employment, says an analysis of government figures published today by
the Low Pay Network.
The network, the federation of low pay units which lobby on behalf of the
low-paid, said revised government figures showed that from last June to
December employment rose only 33,000 while unemployment fell 140,800.
The report's author said that not only was employment growth failing to
match the falls in employment, but such growth as there was in employment
was in part-time jobs.
The Department of Employment said the finding was not new. Thousands of
people came off and on the unemployment register in any month and it was
difficult to match jobless figures to employment data.
