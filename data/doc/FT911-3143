FT  26 APR 91 / World Trade News: Seoul digs in its heels over rice import
ban
SOUTH KOREA, taking a strong position on the issue of food security,
yesterday reaffirmed that it will keep its rice market tightly closed to
imports.
A meeting of senior economic officials, headed by Mr Choi Gak Kyu, minister
for economic planning, ruled out liberalising the rice market and reducing
subsidies for rice production.
'We will not allow imports of rice under any circumstances,' a ministry of
agriculture and fisheries official said after the meeting.
The meeting was prompted by a domestic outcry following remarks made earlier
this week by Mr Park Soo Gil, Korea's chief negotiator in the Uruguay Round
of Gatt negotiations. Mr Park said the opening of the Korean rice market was
inevitable, and that Korea would agree to allowing 3-5 per cent of its rice
demand to be met by imports.
The outcry demonstrates the sensitivity of the issue. Rice is the single
most most important crop for Korean farmers, but the inefficiency of
domestic production means they would find it hard to compete with
international producers. Government subsidies and closed markets mean the
average price of rice in Korea is about five times the Dollars 350 (Pounds
205) a ton it costs on the international market.
Exception for rice and a few other staple products, South Korea has been
demonstrating a more flexible approach to the liberalisation of its
agricultural markets. Since the start of this year, it has reduced the
number of products it is seeking to exclude from liberalisation under the
Uruguay Round of Gatt talks.
Korea originally sought to exclude 15 products, citing non-trade concerns
such as food security. But it now wants to exclude only rice and a few other
staple products such as barley.
