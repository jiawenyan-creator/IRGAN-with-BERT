  [Text] Cairo, 15 Feb (MENA)--Somalia's Mohamed Abdoh Hashi, 
leader of the United Somali Party [name and title as received], 
praised Egypt's support for the efforts being made to solve the 
Somali problem and implement the Addis Ababa Agreement. 
  In a statement he made today following his meeting with 
Ambassador Sa'id Ramadan, assistant foreign minister for African 
affairs, he said he briefed the Egyptian official on the latest 
developments in the Somali problem and exchanged views with him 
on the means to solve the Somali crisis. 
  Asked about incidents in the Somali town of Kismaayo, he 
said 
they were regrettable incidents, resulting from attempts by 
Aidid's people to create tension, especially as the parties in 
Kismaayo were on the verge of achieving national reconciliation. 
He added that Somalia is enjoying stability in most of its 18 
provinces with the exception of some places where there is 
tension. 
  Hashi said he will meet tomorrow with Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid and discuss the role the Arab 
League can play to help the Somali people and in achieving 
national reconciliation. 
  Hashi is the first Somali leader to arrive in Cairo 
following 
the Egyptian Foreign Ministry's invitation to all the Somali 
leaders to unite their positions and start implementing the 
Addis Ababa agreement to solve the Somali problem.
