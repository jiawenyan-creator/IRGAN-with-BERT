THE WORLD 
Israeli soldiers blocked roads and turned back hundreds of Israeli peace 
activists hoping to meet and discuss peace with Palestinians in the occupied 
West Bank. But several hundred others sneaked through or were allowed to pass, 
organizers said. About 1,500 supporters of the Peace Now movement set out from 
four cities for Arab towns. Troops stopped three groups heading for Ramallah, 
Nablus and Beit Sahur, a Peace Now spokesman said, but others persuaded 
soldiers to let them visit two Arab villages near Nablus. Leaders of the 
Palestinian uprising had called on Arab residents to welcome Peace Now 
supporters "with open arms."
