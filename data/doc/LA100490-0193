L.A. HEAT GM OPPOSES MOVING TEAM TO O.C. 
The appointment of veteran public relations expert Dick White as general 
manager of the Los Angeles Heat may signal that the American Professional 
Soccer League team will remain in the South Bay and not move to Orange County 
as previously announced. 
White, a former sports editor at the Torrance Daily Breeze who has held several 
professional sports management jobs over the past 25 years, was appointed 
Tuesday to replace Jill Fracisco, who was fired Sept. 24. 
A graduate of El Camino College and a current board member of the school's 
fund-raising foundation, White, 50, opposes moving the team to Orange County 
for the 1991 season, a decision announced in August by club President John 
Ajemian. Ajemian's announcement has met with resistance from dissident South 
Bay owners and some league officials. 
"We are not going to Orange County," White said. 
Ajemian said in recent weeks it became clear that the Heat would have trouble 
finding a suitable stadium near Mission Viejo, his top choice. In addition, 
there is speculation that the San Diego Nomads, who did poorly at the gate 
after moving to Southwestern College in Chula Vista, are investigating a move 
into South Orange County. PAUL MCLEOD
