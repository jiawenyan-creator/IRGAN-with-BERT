FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: HBG agrees deal with Volker
Stevin
HOLLANDSCHE Beton Groep, the Netherlands' largest construction group, has
agreed to sell its majority stake in Volker Stevin, the country's second
largest builder, in return for acquiring Volker Stevin's dredging
activities, writes Ronald van de Krol.
The planned transaction will end a long-standing impasse between the two
companies sparked by HBG's unsuccessful attempt to take over Volker Stevin
against its will in the late 1980s.
The deal will also create a strong, internationally active dredging company
with annual turnover of nearly Fl 500m (Dollars 255m).
HBG intends a gradual reduction in its stake of 60 per cent in Volker
Stevin, by disposing of most of its shares through a banking syndicate led
by Credit Suisse First Boston and Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson, the Dutch
merchant bank. However, it will retain an unspecified minority stake in
Volker Stevin, which in turn intends to acquire a minority holding in HBG in
order to cement the two companies' new, more friendly relations.
Volker Stevin's dredging operations have an annual turnover of around Fl
230m, slightly less than HBG's dredging turnover of Fl 243m.
HBG will pay for the dredging operations mainly in cash but also partly in
Volker Stevin shares. Volker Stevin said it would then cancel these shares.
