FT  12 SEP 94 / People (Names in the News): Conde accuses establishment
Mario Conde, abruptly dismissed by the Bank of Spain last December as
chairman of Banco Espanol de Credito, alleges in a book to be launched today
that he was the victim of an establishment plot, writes Tom Burns.
Those who lost a lot of money in Conde's former institution, Spain's fourth
largest bank, including US backers of a JP Morgan fund which invested
Dollars 175m just over a year ago in a Banesto rights issue, might want to
know how it was that Bank of Spain inspectors discovered a Dollars 3.5bn
over-valuation of the bank's Dollars 61bn assets.
But El Sistema, which was written at Conde's ranch in southern Spain and
aboard his yacht in the Mediterranean, is about dark politics - not shadowy
auditing.
Son of a customs official and a clever lawyer turned businessman, Conde was
a rank outsider to banking in 1987 when he and a friend sold their
pharmaceuticals company Antibioticos for Dollars 481m, and then used their
proceeds to buy themselves on to the Banesto board.
On becoming chairman weeks later, Conde, aged just 39, fought off a hostile
takeover attempt and proceeded to enlarge the bank at breakneck speed,
conducting, in the process, a wholesale reorganisation of its widespread
industrial assets.
Conde claims he fell foul not just of the network of traditional families
who had run Banesto for generations, but of Spain's sistema, the
establishment, which he found lurking in the Bank of Spain, in the finance
ministry and in the influential El Pais newspaper group. 'I found out how
real power works in Spain and that is what I want to explain,' says Conde.
The maverick financier, who says he is an admirer of Silvio Berlusconi,
plans a countrywide lecture tour in which he will argue that Spain's sistema
needs a shake-out similar to the one Italy has undergone.
Conde's self-evident ambitions are unlikely to impress high court
magistrates who are currently sifting evidence on his business dealings.
