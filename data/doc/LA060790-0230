P.M. BRIEFING; 
WEATHER DAMPENED RETAIL SALES 
Unseasonal weather in parts of the country made May a sluggish month for 
retailing, major chain stores reported today. 
Big general merchandisers and discounters as well as specialty and department 
stores posted modest to middling sales gains for the month. 
"We believe the May sales results were disappointing but principally reflected 
adverse weather conditions in the second half of the month, particularly in the 
East and Midwest," said Merrill Lynch retail analyst Jeffrey Feiner. 
Colder-than-normal temperatures and unusually heavy rainfall in some areas were 
blamed for keeping customers away from stores. The abnormal conditions banished 
thoughts of buying new summer apparel or seasonal merchandise, such as air 
conditioners and outdoor furniture. 
Sears merchandise group said its sales for the four weeks ended June 3 edged up 
0.9% to $2.5 billion. No. 2 ranked K mart Corp. posted a 10.4% May sales 
increase to $2.44 billion. May Department Stores Co. reported a 9% sales 
increase to $725.2 million, while The Limited Inc. said its sales rose 16% to 
$359.7 million.
