Among Us"] 
  [Excerpt] Turku -- There is no organized crime in the Turku 
area and probably none anywhere else in Finland either. So says 
Mikko Paatero, provincial police commissioner. 
  "An organized crime system requires the population's support 
if it is to function. We are a long way from having that in 
Finland," said Paatero on Thursday [17 February] as he presented 
the 1993 crime statistics for Turku/Pori Province. 
<H5>  More Narcotics Crimes </H5>
  Crime seems to have declined in 1993 in comparison with 
1992, 
judging from the statistics presented by Paatero. This is true 
of all types of crime except narcotics offenses, which were up 
from 374 to 493. But actually, that is also good news, says 
Paatero: the number of narcotics offenses reported always 
depends to a large extent on how hard the police have 
concentrated on combating drugs, and in Turku/Pori Province, 
there was a drive against narcotics offenses in 1993. [passage
