FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: Occidental to spin off gas
liquids business
OCCIDENTAL Petroleum is spinning off its US natural gas liquids business
into a joint venture in a Dollars 700m deal that represents its first
significant asset disposal under a plan to cut group debt by Dollars 3bn.
The gas business will be acquired by Trident Energy, a 50/50 joint venture
between Occidental and Hicks, Muse, a Dallas-based investment firm which
specialises in leveraged deals and restructurings.
Last January, shortly after the death of Dr Armand Hammer, Occidental's
chairman, the company announced plans to restructure, including a Dollars
3bn sale of assets.
Trident Energy will pay Dollars 691m in cash for the gas liquids business
and assume Dollars 9m of debt. Both Occidental and Hicks, Muse will invest
up to Dollars 100m in the equity of the new venture and the remainder of the
purchase price will be in the form of debt - which will be non-recourse and
off the balance sheets of both parent companies.
Mr Ray Irani, Occidental's new chairman, said this, together with Dollars
68m of minor asset sales already announced, brought to Dollars 500m the net
proceeds of the debt reduction programme. 'The transaction allows us to take
a significant amount of cash out of the natural gas liquids business while
retaining a 50 per cent ownership position,' he added.
Trident will enter a long-term contract to supply about 30 per cent of its
annual liquid feedstocks output to Occidental's chemicals business. The deal
does not include certain Occidental natural gas liquid assets which it says
are critical to its exploration and production operations.
An Occident spokesman said the group was on target to reach its goal of
Dollars 1.5bn of asset sales by the end of this year.
