FT  10 MAR 93 / CBI urges curb on union links
MR ROBBIE Gilbert, director of employment affairs at the Confederation of
British Industry, said yesterday that more companies should consider
withdrawing from collective bargaining.
He also said in a paper on pay-setting that companies should consider
increasing the proportion of employees on short-term and fixed contracts and
locking labour costs into pay deals of more than a year.
