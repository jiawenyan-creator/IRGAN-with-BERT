FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Quality Care's Pounds 1.8m beats placing
estimate
QUALITY CARE Homes, the nursing homes operator, saw its share price rise 15p
to 225p yesterday after announcing a jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds
781,000 to Pounds 1.84m in the year to October 31.
The figure exceeded the Pounds 1.75m estimate which accompanied the
company's Pounds 4.2m placing and stock market listing in July last year.
The placing price was 136p.
Profits were stated after exceptional costs of Pounds 152,000 related to the
listing.
Turnover was Pounds 6.2m, up 87 per cent on the previous Pounds 3.32m.
Mr Duncan Bannatyne, managing director, said the better than expected
performance had continued in the first two months of the current year.
Occupancy rates had been 98.4 per cent in established homes. Two homes
opened in May and July had filled up faster than expected.
Mr Bannatyne said the company was 'better placed than most to withstand any
competitive pressure on prices' which might result from the change in April
from central to local government funding of nursing care for the elderly.
During the year the number of beds rose from 440 to 540 and a total of 750
is expected by October, with three homes opening and one being extended. The
average capital cost per bed is Pounds 17,500.
Net interest paid in the 12 months was Pounds 458,000 (Pounds 425,000) and
after a 30.1 per cent (34.3 per cent) tax charge, earnings per share rose
from 5.13p to 11.77p, or 12.78p excluding the exceptional charge.
A final dividend of 0.75p is proposed, as forecast. A 0.15p payment was made
prior to the placing. Had QCH been listed for the whole year a total
dividend of 4p would have been paid.
Borrowings were cut to Pounds 2m, 15 per cent of shareholders' funds, from
Pounds 5m at the end of the previous year and Pounds 5.5m at the flotation.
Capital expenditure in the year was Pounds 3.06m, compared to cashflow
generated from operations of Pounds 2.58m.
Mr Bannatyne said gearing would rise this year - the rate depended on the
amount of land bought for development beyond the current year - but would
not exceed 50 per cent.
