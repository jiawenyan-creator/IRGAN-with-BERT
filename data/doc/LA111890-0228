CORONADO WINS FOURTH WATER POLO TITLE IN ROW 
The Coronado water polo team wasn't quite sure if its coach, Randy Burgess, 
would make it in time to see the Islanders play Poway for the 3-A Section title 
Saturday. 
As it turned out, it didn't matter. 
Coronado (28-4) claimed its fourth consecutive Section title by defeating 
Poway, 14-9, at the Jewish Community Center. And Burgess, who did arrive 30 
minutes before the game, praised his team's play even though the Islanders had 
to play catchup a couple of times. 
"They played us tough, but I felt our kids weren't really focused on the game," 
Burgess said. 
After a 3-3 first-quarter tie, Poway forced Coronado to play catchup in the 
second quarter. At halftime, the score was again tied, 5-5. 
In the third quarter, Poway (23-1) took an 8-6 lead. But with three minutes 
remaining in the quarter, Coronado went on a scoring spree and led, 10-8, 
entering the fourth. 
"After it was 8-6 I thought we were in control of the game," Poway Coach Greg 
Ormsby said. "They just went on a rampage. They're a very balanced field and 
(they have) the best qoalie in the county (Jack Bowen)." 
Earlier in the day, Valhalla defeated USDHS, 17-10, to win the 2-A 
championship. 
In the 2-A game, USDHS tried, but couldn't stop Mike Nalu, who scored nine 
goals for Valhalla. Eric Nielsen added four for the Norsemen. USDHS was led by 
Doug Munz, who scored six goals. 
"We wanted to try to have two people on Mike when he gets the ball," USDHS 
Coach Dan Crane said. "He's so quick that he turns and make things happen."
