FT  13 OCT 93 / Mexican power sale setback
MEXICO'S ambitious programme to privatise electricity generation has
received a blow after investors pulled out of buying a plant in the northern
state of Coahuila.
The Carbon II plant was to be sold for Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) to a
consortium 49 per cent owned by Mission Energy, a subsidiary of Southern
California Edison, and 51 per cent owned by Mexico's Grupo Acerero del Norte
and Organizacion Autrey.
US environmentalists complained pollution from the plant would blow over the
border into the Big Bend National Park in Texas, and demanded smokestack
scrubbers be fitted at a cost of about Dollars 300m. Such scrubbers are
demanded by US law, but not by Mexico.
Mr John Bryson, chief executive of Southern California Edison, said
circumstances were not favourable to conclude the deal.
