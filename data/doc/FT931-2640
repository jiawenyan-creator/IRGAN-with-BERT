FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Ernest Green declines 35% to Pounds 302,000
Ernest Green &amp; Partners Holdings, the structural, civil and environmental
engineering consultancy, saw interim pre-tax profits decline by 35 per cent
from Pounds 468,000 to Pounds 302,000 on reduced sales of Pounds 3.64m,
against Pounds 4.03m.
Mr David Legg, chairman, referred to the depressed level of construction
work, but measures to match resources and costs to work available had
enabled the company to remain profitable in the six months to December 31.
In the previous first half the USM-quoted company had carried
rationalisation costs of Pounds 142,000, offset partly by Pounds 126,000
from property sales.
An unchanged interim dividend of 2.75p is payable from earnings of 2.8p
(4.6p).
