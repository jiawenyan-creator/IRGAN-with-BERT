  [Text] Sanaa, March 1 (AFP)--A Yemeni defence ministry 
spokesman here Tuesday accused southern troops of shelling a 
region of Abyan province and denied that northern soldiers were 
to blame. 
  Earlier Aden radio, quoting another senior official at the 
ministry, said troops of the former North Yemen had launched an 
offensive "against the 36th division of Al-Wahdah brigade and 
against civilians" at Mudiyah, in Abyan. 
  The northern forces used tanks, artillery and multiple 
rocket- launchers, charged the radio in the south's main city. 
  However, the ministry spokesman in Sanaa said that "forces 
under elements influenced by the Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) 
shelled inhabitants of Mudiyah with heavy artillery late Monday." 
  The Aden-based YSP is led by Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, a southerner and chief political rival of President 'Ali 
Abdallah Salih, who is based in Sanaa. 
  The latest accusations came after Jordanian and Omani 
mediators announced Monday that northerners and southerners had 
agreed to measures to halt fighting which has cost at least 20 
lives in the past week in Abyan alone. 
  The country, formerly divided into North Yemen and 
communist- 
ruled South Yemen, was unified in May 1990, though each side 
retains a separate army. 
  A political crisis erupted last August when al-Bid refused 
to 
take up his duties in Sanaa, demanding decentralisation and 
economic, political and military reforms. 
  Al-Bid and Salih signed a reconciliation accord in Jordan on 
February 20, but it has so far failed to end the crisis.
