MARION BARRY'S TRIAL 
As a counselor for recovering addicts I must say that the government's 
treatment of Washington Mayor Marion Barry was very sleazy. Worse, it was 
immoral. 
Here we have the mayor stating on FBI tape that he has been clean for a while. 
The quote is "I've been so goddamn good . . . I've even surprised myself . . . 
no women and none of that kind of (cocaine) stuff." Yet, what do our police 
servants do? They entice Barry to fall off the wagon. They actually bring him 
cocaine, drug paraphernalia, and a friend to talk him into using it. 
Recidivism is very common among users trying to quit. Yet to have our very own 
government officials take advantage of that fact, just so that they can score a 
few political points and thereby quiet a critic of the Bush Administration is 
very shameful. 
Further though, is the greater irony that while Barry's fall from grace was 
being orchestrated, the same FBI and Bush Administration were not taking any 
meaningful action on the reports that officers and friends in the U.S. attorney 
general's office were also doing cocaine.
