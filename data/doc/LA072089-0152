SENATE VOTES FOR PLOT TO HONOR CHINA PROTEST 
The Senate voted Wednesday to name a grassy plot near the Chinese Embassy in 
Washington "Tian An Men Square Park" in honor of pro-democracy demonstrators in 
Beijing. 
In addition to memorializing demonstrators who were killed by the Chinese army, 
said the bill's sponsor, Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.), the action serves "to 
remind Beijing that America will never and can never forget the ruthlessness 
and callousness of the Chinese government in crushing their 
citizen-demonstrators and their aspirations." 
The proposal expresses the sense of Congress that a statue should be 
constructed to honor the fallen students. 
The amendment was added by voice vote to a bill authorizing State Department 
programs for the new budget year.
