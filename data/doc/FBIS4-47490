  [Abstract] The human eye as a time and space filter is by 
no means an ideal integrator and this makes necessary a search 
for a more modern method for taking its integrating properties 
into account, including when observing moving objects. The 
traditional formula employed is not adequate for this purpose 
because it is assumed that the imager is fixed relative to the 
observed object and the angular dimension of its image does not 
exceed the region of spatial summation of the human eye (11.6 
mrad). An improved method is therefore proposed for taking into 
account the time and space integrating properties of the human 
eye when analyzing images transmitted by thermal imagery 
instruments and for eliminating the assumptions formerly 
introduced. The necessary formulas for this purpose are derived. 
It is shown that the traditional method is adequate for thermal 
imagers fixed relative to the observed objects when the relation 
between the equivalent dimension a of the object and the 
dimension of a thermal imager element q is a/q &lt; 5...6. In 
contrast, the proposed method, based on real, rather than 
idealized properties of the human eye, does not have these 
limitations and can be used when estimating the principal 
efficiency indices of thermal imagers for a broader range of 
conditions of practical interest. The method is suitable for 
such purposes as observing moving objects and (or) large-jarea 
objects. References 8: 7 Russian, 1 Western.
