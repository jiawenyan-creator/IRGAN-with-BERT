FT  19 NOV 93 / Bonuses at Goldman point to City bonanza
GOLDMAN SACHS, the US investment bank, kicked off the annual round of bonus
awards in the City yesterday, at the end of a year when record profits at
many securities houses and investment banks have fuelled hopes of hefty
rewards.
'The level of bonuses in the City this year will be very varied - it ranges
from 20 or 25 per cent of basic (salary) to multiples of basic,' said Mr
Roger Steere, director of executive recruitment at Jonathan Wren. For
traders earning a basic salary of Pounds 50,000, this could mean total
remuneration of Pounds 200,000 or more.
At the top of the bonus league are the proprietary traders - also known as
arbitrage dealers - who use their bank's own capital to take large positions
on the market, which can generate massive returns: some of them are
expecting bonuses of Pounds 1m or more.
One beneficiary of additional emoluments at Goldman is Mr Michael Sherwood,
28, an executive director in charge of new bond issues, who will be given
some of the credit for Goldman's leap to the top of the Eurobond league
table. As well as a huge bonus which other dealers reckon could top Dollars
1m, Mr Sherwood could be in line for a partnership, when new partners are
next appointed in November 1994.
The level of Goldman awards will fuel expectations at other houses: in a
memo to London staff, the partnership announced a 30 per cent year-end bonus
for all locally hired employees. This is on top of personal bonuses awarded
for individual performance, about which the firm started to inform staff on
Monday.
Goldman's November year-end means it is ahead of the field in deciding bonus
levels. Some companies do not pay out until March or April next year.
City traders are particularly optimistic about bonuses this year because the
bull market has helped them exceed the targets which were set at the
beginning of the year.
But banks and securities houses are becoming wary about the size of payouts.
Some are trying to defer some payments of bonuses by offering shares, or
options on shares, so that employees have a stake in the company. This is
particularly true at senior levels: for example, the highest-paid employees
at Salomon Brothers may get up to half their bonuses in shares.
But traders and sales staff without any management responsibility are keen
on cash. 'Dealers tend to get pretty substantial cash bonuses, and that's
what they are working for,' said Sir John Trelawny, senior partner at GKR,
the headhunter. He pointed out that bonuses are seen as compensation for
working in a demanding and risky business, without long-term prospects.
One 27-year old German government bond trader said: 'Most people live off
their basic and save their bonus . . . they realise things may not last for
ever.'
The bonus bonanza has also made it more difficult - or more expensive - to
recruit staff. Those in line for big bonuses effectively 'have a price on
their head,' says Mr Steere. 'They expect to be given upfront compensation
for bonuses' they will miss if they move to another job.
This year's bull market has revived the jobs market in the City, and upped
the stakes. For example, in a recent spate of hirings in the gilts market by
houses which are planning to become gilts marketmakers, Yamaichi
International (Europe), and Merrill Lynch have had to to pay dearly for
qualified staff, with market rumours circulating of seven-digit salaries and
three-year guaranteed contracts.
The size of bonuses and the number of calls which traders have been
receiving from headhunters may have brought back memories of the heady days
of the 1980s.
However, this time round most City pros are playing safe. Bonus cheques are
being deposited in the bank or used to pay off mortgages. 'It's the sign of
the top of the market, and there's no doubt that next year will be very
tough,' said one syndicate manager.
However, some Goldman employees were making more exciting, but still
relatively conservative plans: 'I'm going for a two-week skiing holiday  -
skiing is the best way to escape,' he said. 'Things are a bit different. In
the 1980s, people would have gone out and bought a Porsche 911.'
