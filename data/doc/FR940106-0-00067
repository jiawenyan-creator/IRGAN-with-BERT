 



POP. 

The 1994 trip limit for POP is the same as in 19911993: 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg) or 20 percent of all fish on board,
whichever is less, in landings of POP above 1,000 pounds (454 kg). This is not a cumulative limit because it is intended
to accommodate only incidental catches. It therefore applies to each fishing trip. Because the trip limit for POP
is intended to accommodate only unavoidable incidental catches, it will not be increased if landings are lower than
the harvest guideline.



DTS complex (Dover sole, thornyheads, and trawl-caught sablefish). 


In January 1993, the cumulative trip limit for the DTS complex was 45,000 pounds (20,412 kg) per 2-week period, of which
no more than 20,000 pounds (9,072 kg) could be thornyheads and no more than 1,000 pounds (454 kg), or 25 percent of the
DTS complex, whichever was greater, could be sablefish. In April, the trip limits were reduced and applied on a 4-week
cumulative basis: 60,000 pounds (27,216 kg) of the DTS complex, of which no more than 35,000 pounds (15,876 kg) could
be thornyheads. The sablefish trip limit remained the same (but was expected to result in lower landings due to the
reduction in the trip limit for the complex) until September when a ceiling of 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg) per trip was added.
Nonetheless, landings continued at high levels and, at the Council's November 1993 meeting, were projected to exceed
the harvest guidelines for trawl-caught sablefish by 18 percent and for thornyheads by 17 percent. Dover sole landings
were projected to be 17 percent below its coastwide harvest guideline, but only 3 percent below the harvest guideline
in the Columbia subarea (which is 1,000 mt lower in 1994). Further reductions were implemented in December 1993 (58
FR 64169, December 6, 1993) but were not expected to substantially reduce these overages. Throughout the year, no
more than 5,000 pound (2,268 kg) of sablefish per trip could be smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) (total length).
In 1994, the cumulative trip limit for the DTS complex is 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg) per month, including no more than
30,000 pounds (13,608 kg) of thornyheads and 12,000 pounds (5,443 kg) of trawl-caught sablefish. The cumulative
period is lengthened from 4-weeks to calendar month. The sablefish trip limit of 1,000 pounds (454 kg) or 25 percent
of the DTS complex, whichever is greater, that applies to each trip, remains in effect. The 5,000-pound (2,268 kg)
trip limit on sablefish smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) also continues. Even though the sablefish harvest guideline
applies only to the Vancouver, Columbia, Eureka, and Monterey areas, these trip limits are applied coastwide to avoid
effort shifts into the Conception area.


Nontrawl trip limits for sablefish. 

In 1993, a coastwide 250-pound (113 kg) daily trip limit was applied until May 9, the beginning of the 72-hour closure
before the start of the regular season on May 12. The 250-pound (113 kg) daily trip limit was reimposed on June 5 following
a 72-hour closure beginning June 2. Landings are projected to be within one percent of the harvest guideline in 1993.
The harvest guideline applies coastwide except for the Conception subarea.
Daily trip limits are established again in 1994, until 72 hours before, and 72 hours after, the regular season which
is scheduled to start on May 15, 1994. However, the 250-pound (113 kg) daily trip limit will apply only to the Vancouver,
Columbia, Eureka, and Monterey subareas, the same areas covered by the harvest guideline. In the Conception area,
where there is no harvest guideline and landings have been below the 425 mt ABC, the daily trip limit is increased to
350 pounds (159 kg). This limit will accommodate most current landings without encouraging excessive effort shifts
into that area.
The trip limit for sablefish smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) (1,500 pounds (680 kg) or 3 percent of all legal sablefish
on board, whichever is greater) remains in effect.


Pacific whiting. 

The Council recommended continuation of the 10,000-pound (4,536 kg) trip limit for Pacific whiting taken before
and after the regular season. In 1994, the regular season begins on March 1 between 42
&cir;00
&rsquo;_40
&cir;30
&rsquo; N. latitude, and on April 15 north of 42
&cir;00
&rsquo; N. latitude and south of 40
&cir;30
&rsquo; N. latitude.


Open-access fishery. 

At its November meeting, the Council recommended open-access fishery trip limits for certain gear types, areas,
and species or species groups. For all open-access gear except trawls, the Council recommended: (1) A 10,000 pound
(4,536 kg) trip limit for all rockfish, not to exceed 40,000 pounds (18,144 kg) cumulative in a month; and (2) a sablefish
trip limit of the same amounts and areas as for the limited-entry nontrawl fishery at the beginning of the year (250
pounds (113 kg) per day north of 36
&cir;00
&rsquo; N. latitude; 350 pounds (159 kg) per day south of 36
&cir;00
&rsquo; N. latitude). For shrimp trawls, the trip limit for spot and ridgeback prawns remains the same at 1,000 pounds
(454 kg) of groundfish per trip, and the trip limit in the pink shrimp fishery (1,500 pounds (680 kg) of groundfish per
day times the number of days in the fishing trip) is the same except the exclusion of whiting, shortbelly rockfish,
and arrowtooth flounder is removed. The trip limits all are designed to keep landings within the open-access allocation
for as long as possible during the year. In addition, any more restrictive limits imposed on the limited-entry vessels
also apply to the open-access vessels. In particular, the cumulative monthly limits for bocaccio and for yellowtail
rockfish are more restrictive than the 40,000 pounds (18,144 kg) cumulative limit on all rockfish in the open-access
fishery.
Public comment resulting from the discussion of trip limits at the September 1993 Council meeting revealed two minor
trawl fisheries for non-groundfish species (California halibut and sea cucumbers south of Point Arena, California)
that incidentally take small amounts of groundfish. If these vessels had landed the 500-pound (227 kg) minimum landing
requirement during the window period, they would have qualified for a limited-entry permit, but they did not. These
vessels are considered to be using exempt gears, and therefore may participate in the open-access fishery. The Council
agreed that the total take of groundfish in these fisheries was insignificant, if measurable, and that there was no
need to force these fishers to discard incidentally-caught groundfish. Therefore, a 500-pound (227 kg) trip limit
for all groundfish species was recommended for these fisheries.
Vessels using open-access gear are subject to the management measures for the open-access fishery, whether or not
the vessel has a valid limited-entry permit endorsed for any other gear. In addition, a vessel operating in the open-access
fishery must not exceed any trip limit, frequency limit, and/or size limit for the same gear and/or subarea in the limited-entry
fishery (as announced in this 

Federal Register

 notice in paragraphs titled ``limited-entry''). A vessel that operates in both the open-access and limited-entry
fisheries is not entitled to two separate trip limits for the same species. Fish caught with open-access gear will
also be counted toward the limited-entry trip limit. For example; In one month, a trawl vessel catches 12,000 pounds
(5,443 kg) of yellowtail rockfish in the limited-entry fishery, and in the same month catches 4,000 pounds (1,814
kg) of yellowtail rockfish using hook-and-line (open-access) gear. Because the open-access landings are counted
toward the limited-entry limit, the vessel would have exceeded its monthly 14,000 pound (6,350 kg) limited-entry
limit for yellowtail rockfish by 2,000 pounds (907 kg).
