MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO 
Just in Time for Sweeps: Michael Tuck, who began as KCBS Channel 2's 6 p.m. 
anchor less than two months ago, will begin offering commentaries on Southern 
California issues every weeknight on the station's 11 p.m. newscast, beginning 
this week. Tuck came to KCBS from the ABC affiliate in San Diego, where he also 
regularly expressed his opinions on the air, won several awards and generated a 
good deal of controversy. KCBS has not had on-air commentaries since Bill Stout 
died last year. CLAUDIA PUIG
