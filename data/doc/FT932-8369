FT  19 MAY 93 / Saarstahl files for bankruptcy
SAARSTAHL, the French-owned steelmaker employing 7,200 workers in Saarland,
Germany's traditional steel and coal region, last night filed for bankruptcy
after deciding it could no longer sustain losses running at DM30m (Pounds
12m) a month.
The company, once the bastion of the steel industry in the region, belongs
to the DHS-Dillinger Hutte Saarstahl group, which is 70 per cent owned by
Usinor-Sacilor of France.
'A company with such heavy losses cannot get back on its feet in the
foreseeable future,' a Usinor-Sacilor official said.
Mr Oskar Lafontaine, Saarland's prime minister, tried to reassure local
steelworkers last night by saying that all possible measures would be taken
by the state government to ensure that the company continued part of its
activities for some time.
The Saarland state owns 27.5 per cent of DHS group. A symbolic 2.5 per cent
is held by the Arbed steel group of Luxembourg, which owned the group until
1988.
Usinor-Sacilor said the decision to file for bankruptcy had been taken after
consultation with the state government. It added that bankruptcy proceedings
would not affect the rest of the DHS group, which includes the Dillinger
steel works employing 5,700 workers.
Saarstahl manufactured 2.2m tonnes of steel rods, bars and wire last year.
It announced in March that it would cut nearly half its workforce over the
next 18 months, bringing employment down to 4,500. Ten years ago, Saarstahl
employed 20,000.
