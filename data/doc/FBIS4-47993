  [Text] The president of the Reserve Bank says South Africa 
cannot expect long-term investments, such as the construction of 
industries by foreign companies, to flood into the country. Dr. 
Chris Stals said in Cape Town that South Africa must keep 
inflation as low as possible, especially to protect more 
disadvantaged people. He commented that political and economic 
stability is necessary to persuade foreign investors that their 
investments are secure. 
  [Begin Stals recording] Yes, I think that for the 
construction of a factory, for example, one that has to produce 
locally for a long time, one would need much more security 
concerning the economic policy and political stability, and I 
think that that sort of investment will only come later, once we 
have confirmed our own credibility and credit worthiness. [end
