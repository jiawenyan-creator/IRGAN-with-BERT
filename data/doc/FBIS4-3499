  [Text] Taipei, April 19 (CNA) -- Taiwan's heavy industry 
production value accounted for 61.8 percent of total 
manufacturing value in 1993, up 11.4 percent from six years ago, 
according to government statistics released Tuesday [19 April]. 
  In [word indistinct] heavy industry production value totaled 
NT$3.1 trillion (US$117.5 billion), up from NT$1.9 trillion 
(US$72 billion) in 1987, a Directorate General of Budget, 
Accounting and Statistics (DGOAS) official said. 
  The average 7.9 percent annual industrial growth recorded 
during the six-year period was due to increased productivity and 
competitiveness fueled by a move to raise value-added 
production, the official added. 
  The statistics also revealed that Taiwan's economy, after 
many years of fast growth, has moved from a labor-intensive to a 
technology-intensive one, the official eaid. 
  He attributed the transformation to a recent mass relocation 
of labor-intensive industries overseas. 
  As the low-cost labor-intensive industries shifted to newly- 
emerging economies such as Mainland China and Southeast Asian 
countries, Taiwan's dependence on such industries also 
decreased, the DGOAS official said.
