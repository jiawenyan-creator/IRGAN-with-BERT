FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bad debts leave Baltic Pounds 6.5m in red
AFTER provisions of Pounds 13.1m for bad debts and property, Baltic, the
leasing group, made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.55m last year, compared with
a profit of Pounds 9.1m in 1991.
The final dividend is cut to 0.5p, making a total of 1p, down from 4.33p.
Mr Michael Goddard, chairman, said a further Pounds 3.3m had been added to
bad debt provisions since the interim stage. Withdrawal from construction
equipment and aircraft financing incurred charges of Pounds 6.2m. A further
Pounds 2m was written off property values.
Operating profit declined by 49 per cent to Pounds 6.02m (Pounds 11.8m) on
turnover of Pounds 35.5m (Pounds 38.5m). More than a quarter of turnover was
accounted for by contract hire, which has been disposed of.
On continuing activities a profit of Pounds 2.34m (Pounds 21.2m) was made
after the Pounds 13.1m provisions. The main items in the leasing portfolio
are forklift trucks, other handling equipment and vehicles, and computers.
Mr Harry Hyman, finance director, warned that there could be further bad
debt provisions this year. The group believed that any fall in the level of
bad debts would lag behind economic recovery.
Attempts to rebuild profitability were constricted by the lack of funding.
'Without gearing an asset finance company will not make an acceptable return
on capital.'
Mr Goddard said business had been badly affected by the poor reputation of
asset finance, leading 'some banks indiscriminately to withdraw financing
across the sector'.
The group's asset finance portfolio had been reduced from Pounds 220m to
Pounds 90m and net debt came down Pounds 75m to Pounds 46m.
Since the year-end the contract hire sale had reduced it further to Pounds
22m.
Interest costs declined from Pounds 14.2m to Pounds 11.9m. Mr Hyman said
they would be far lower this year.
Diluted losses per share were 16.9p (earnings 13.3p). Basic losses were 27p
(earnings 14.7p).
