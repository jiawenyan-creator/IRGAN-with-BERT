FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Malaysian utility profit up 31%
TENAGA Nasional, the partially privatised Malaysian electricity utility, has
announced pre-tax profits for the year ending August 31 1993 of MDollars
1.85bn (USDollars 726m), a 31 per cent rise on last year's figures, writes
Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
Revenues were up 18 per cent to MDollars 5.03bn while earnings per share
rose 15 per cent to 50.8 Malaysian cents. The total dividend for the year
was 12 Malaysian cents.
Tenaga, in which the government still owns a stake of more than 70 per cent,
is one of Malaysia's biggest listed companies.
The electricity utility has had a difficult year and came under strong
criticism following serious power shortages.
