FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hickson declines 9% to Pounds 22.1m -
Pounds 3m provided for rationalisation at main site in West Yorkshire
Hickson International, the speciality chemicals group, reported pre-tax
profits down by Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 22.1m in 1993 after providing Pounds
3m for rationalisation at its main site at Castleford, West Yorkshire.
The company, which has seen a series of boardroom upheavals in recent years,
also said that Sir Gordon Jones was planning to step down as non-executive
chairman.
Sir Gordon, 67, who is chairman of Yorkshire Water, was brought in three
years ago as new management tried to sort out the group after a string of
acquisitions in the late 1980s.
The restructuring at Castleford involves dropping a number of 'non-core'
product lines which are suffering from increasing competition from India and
China. The Pounds 3m provision covers the first year of a three year
programme.
Profits from the fine chemicals division, which includes Castleford and the
Irish pharmaceuticals intermediates business bought in July 1992, fell
Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 12.6m after using Pounds 1m of pre-acquisition
provisions. Both operations have suffered accidents in the last 18 months
which cost a net Pounds 400,000 after insurance claims. As a result the
group's insurance premiums are expected to rise from Pounds 4.5m to more
than Pounds 6m this year.
The protection and coatings division turned in operating profits of Pounds
11.9m (Pounds 9.9m) but performance products saw profits down Pounds 1.1m to
Pounds 7.9m.
Group sales rose to Pounds 368.3m (Pounds 342.5m) with underlying growth of
just 2 per cent.
Earnings per share slipped to 10p (10.5p) but dividends are held at 8p with
a recommended final of 5.15p.
After heavy capital investment of Pounds 35.2m (Pounds 34.4m) gearing rose
to 51.3 per cent at the period end (35.5 per cent) but capital expenditure
will fall by Pounds 10m this year. Hickson has a Pounds 40m convertible
capital bond which is redeemable from the end of the year cutting the
interest charge by Pounds 2.5m. The group has sufficient facilities to
redeem the bonds out of debt.
COMMENT
The new team at Hickson has had a very difficult time over the last 18
months, with two accidents, tough trading conditions and poor performances
from recent acquisitions. Cash has continued to flow out of the business
leaving the balance sheet stretched. And the problems of the fine chemicals
division have been aggravated by increased competition from India and China.
Assuming profits of about Pounds 26m this year the shares are on a multiple
of more than 17 which looks high enough for now.
