FT  24 FEB 94 / BAe cuts losses and posts higher dividend
British Aerospace yesterday reported a sharply reduced Pounds 237m pre-tax
loss for 1993 reflecting lower exceptional costs together with a return to
profits at the operating level.
The pre-tax loss, which compares with the group's record breaking Pounds
1.2bn deficit in 1992, was struck after Pounds 308m of exceptional charges
including a further Pounds 250m provision to cover potential losses on
aircraft financing leases. The 1992 results included Pounds 1bn of
exceptional charges.
Despite the continued losses, the board signalled its confidence in the
future by proposing an increased final dividend of 5p, from 4p, making 8.3p
for the year - a 19 per cent advance. The group's shares closed up 9p at
549p.
Mr John Cahill, BAe's outgoing chairman, said 1993 had marked 'a turning
point' with real progress being made towards refocusing the group on its
strengths in defence and aerospace, including the recently announced sale of
Rover Cars to BMW.
Over the past year BAe has also sold its Corporate Jets business and the
Ballast Nedham group of construction companies.
Mr Cahill, who is stepping down after only two years of his five-year term
and will be replaced by a part-time non-executive chairman, Mr Bob Bauman,
said BAe 'has made the culture change from a 'cost plus' to a 'cost
conscious' company'.
Excluding provisions, the group posted a Pounds 229m operating profit
compared with a Pounds 66m loss the previous year, on sales which increased
by 7.85 per cent to Pounds 10.8m.
The turnround at the operating level was led by the motor vehicle operations
which turned a Pounds 49m loss in 1992 into a Pounds 56m profit on sales
which rose by almost 17 per cent to Pounds 4.3m.
The other highlight was a halving of the losses on commercial aircraft
operations which fell from Pounds 337m to Pounds 162m, on sales which grew
to Pounds 1.58bn (Pounds 1.49bn.)
Mr Dick Evans, chief executive, said that despite the stalled talks with
Taiwan Aerospace over a regional aircraft joint venture, the main objective
of the regional aircraft operations continued to be to position both the
Jetstream and Avro businesses into international groupings to reduce risk
and enhance market access.
Mr Evans added that it had been 'a good year' for Airbus in which BAE has a
20 per cent stake. He said the European aircraft manufacturer moved into
profit in the second half helped by a richer mix of sales.
The core defence operations turned in another solid performance contributing
Pounds 345m (Pounds 352m) to profits on flat sales of Pounds 3.96bn (Pounds
4bn) while increasing their order book by Pounds 1.7bn to Pounds 8.8bn. Mr
Evans said that since 1988 profits per employee had increased fourfold.
Interest charges increased from Pounds 126m to Pounds 186m. After tax of
Pounds 6m (Pounds 272m) and minorities, the net loss was Pounds 214m (Pounds
888m.)
However the larger than expected Pounds 326m operating cash inflow enabled
BAe to end the year with reduced net debt of Pounds 165m (Pounds 257m)
representing gearing of 9.9 per cent. Shareholders funds fell to Pounds
1.51bn (Pounds 1.78bn.)
