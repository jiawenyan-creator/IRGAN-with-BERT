Raglan Property Trust has announced proposals for a capital restructuring
which involves raising Pounds 7m of new equity and the conversion of Pounds

from the proceeds of the share issue.
Under the restructure each share will be divided into one ordinary share of
0.01p and one deferred share of 0.99p. Every 100 resulting ordinary shares
will be consolidated into one ordinary 1p share. The deferred shares and the
company's share premium account will be cancelled.
The Pounds 7m of new equity will be raised through the issue of 700m new 1p
shares.
The offer, through NM Rothschild, will involve up to 233m shares on the
basis of 1.3257 new shares for every existing share.
