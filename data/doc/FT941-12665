FT  28 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Retailers under pressure
The last batch of Christmas trading reports from high street retailers came
amid growing signs of investor disquiet at the patchiness of the recovery in
consumer confidence.
Shares in Marks and Spencer, the jewel in the portfolio of many an
investment manager, were marked down after the sparse details unveiled in
its trading statement. Speculation of improved trading at Marks in recent
weeks had led some analysts to upgrade profits forecasts. The shares closed
15 1/2 down at 426 1/2 p in turnover of 14m.
But there was worse to come as Marks' early morning announcement was
followed by the trading statement from Burton, described by one specialist
as 'the worst of all possible scenarios'.
Burton's margins were badly hit and sales were flat, which contrasted
starkly with Next's sparkling figures only two days ago. Burton shares
retreated 8 3/4 to 58 3/4 p in very heavy turnover of 44m. Brokers made
swingeing cuts to their forecasts, with Cazenove and BZW, the company's
joint brokers, said to have lowered their 1994 profits predictions by 33 per
cent from Pounds 60m to Pounds 40m. But Next was not immune to the bearish
tone and slid 9 1/2 to 231 1/2 p.
Furniture retailer MFI produced results at the top end of expectations.
Sales were encouraging and gross margins firm. Analysts upgraded forecasts
by around 20 per cent to a range of Pounds 68m to Pounds 73m. Ms Emma
Burdett at Hoare Govett reiterated her positive recommendation.
'MFI is a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy sector,' she commented. The
shares moved forward 5 to 179p.
