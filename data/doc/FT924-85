FT  31 DEC 92 / Tokyo stock market down 26.4% on year
THREE IS a symbolic, cyclical number in Japan, and thus it was appropriate
that the Tokyo stock average should tumble again yesterday to mark three
years of falling prices, declining turnover, and fading investor confidence.
When traders and Tokyo exchange officials closed 1992 with rhythmic
clapping, stock prices were down 26.4 per cent on the year and 2.1 per cent
on the day, leaving the Nikkei average at 16,924.95 and Japanese brokers
nervous about the omens for next year.
Taking the common standards of superstition as a guide, 1993 will either
mark the beginning of a new cycle of goodness, and rapidly rising stock
prices, or the fourth year of a five-year cycle of collapse, decay and
ever-larger losses.
Portents aside, the hard statistics add up to a particularly bleak trading
year. The daily average volume on the exchange's first section was 264.9m
shares, the lowest since 1977, and a quarter that of the 'bubble' year of
1988.
The trading value for the year was Y58,881bn (Pounds 84.3bn), about one
sixth of the record set in 1989, and the lowest level since 1984.
Brokers were starved of commissions, individual investors shunned the
market, and a long queue of eager sellers formed each time share prices
appeared to gain strength.
At the close yesterday, the Nikkei average was down 56.5 per cent from the
record high of 38,915.87 on December 29, 1989, while the three years of
consecutive decline are a record.
To emphasise things may get worse before they get better, trading volume on
Monday, at 100m shares, was the lowest since 1982.
A Tokyo exchange official, after clapping out the year, said: 'We have
already forgotten 1992.' Foreign brokers are generally forecasting the
Nikkei will trade between 16,000 and 20,000 next year, while Japanese houses
are telling customers that 25,000.
The third year of the cycle was particularly tough on stocks favoured by the
few remaining speculators last year.
Godo Shusei, a maker of sake and plum wine, was the big loser, down 79.3 per
cent, followed by Daito Boshoku, a wool spinner, which lost 79.2 per cent of
its value.
Japanese business magazines, only half-jokingly, have suggested the
three-five-seven cycle means that manufacturers will take three years to
recover from falling sales and asset values, the brokers will need five
years, and the banks seven years.
More pessimistic soothsayers predict that all three sectors will need seven
years.
