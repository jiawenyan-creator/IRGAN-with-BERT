  [Excerpt] [Portuguese] Prime Minister Silva and Israeli 
Prime Minister Rabin are at the moment giving a press 
conference. The Middle East peace process and the withdrawal 
from Gaza and Jericho are obviously key points of this visit. 
Raquel Abecassis reports: 
  [Abecassis] Silva began by congratulating Rabin for being a 
peacemaker in the Middle East. The Israeli Prime Minister 
responded by thanking Silva and stressed the importance of 
Silva's visit to Israel in October 1992. Rabin described it as 
a very important landmark in the development of bilateral 
relations between the two countries. Then the two prime 
ministers went on to speak of the excellent economic, and other, 
relations between the two countries. Rabin is at the moment 
answering questions. The first question was whether he would 
confirm reports that the Israeli government was willing to 
withdraw from the occupied territories of Gaza and Jericho 
within two weeks. Rabin said that the process was still under 
way, he added an agreement on the type of autonomy had not yet 
been reached but he stated that the withdrawal would take place 
soon but not in the next two weeks. [passage omitted]
