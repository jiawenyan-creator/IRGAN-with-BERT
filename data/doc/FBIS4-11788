  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin told opposition 
leaders that the plan to concentrate the Hebron Jews in one 
place or to evacuate settlements from the territories has been 
removed from the agenda, National Religious Party Knesset Member 
Yig'al Bibi told our correspondent Shmu'el Tal. The prime 
minister also said that there is no intention to evacuate even 
Tall al-Rumaythah. 
  He reiterated that the Likud created the precedent of 
uprooting settlements. The opposition leaders warned against 
evacuating settlements and said it would cause a deep split in 
the nation.
