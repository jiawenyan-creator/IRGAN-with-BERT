FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Stirling Group leaps to Pounds 1.37m
STIRLING GROUP, which aims, according to Mr Peter Sheldon, chairman, to
become a 'broad-based textiles manufacturer and distributor', more than
doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.37m in the six months to September 30.
The rise from Pounds 581,000 was struck on turnover sharply up at Pounds
45.6m (Pounds 26.1m), largely as a result of the first-time contributions
from E Gifford and Ritz Design.
Mr Sheldon said acquisitions were a large part of Stirling's strategy for
growth. In the period under review, it bought Boftex for Pounds 440,000 and
the Rigby &amp; Peller lingerie brand for 'an insignificant amount'.
In the contract division turnover rose to Pounds 35.6m. The closure of four
Bentwood factories following the Ritz integration was the only sour note.
On the importing side, which supplies C&amp;A, BhS and Littlewoods, turnover
declined 15 per cent to Pounds 7.9m after problems with a supplier.
Interest payable grew to Pounds 357,000 (Pounds 3,000) on acquisition of
Ritz's Pounds 4.5m medium-term debt. Earnings were 1.07p (1.03p) and the
interim dividend is held at 0.5p.
