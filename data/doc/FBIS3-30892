  [Excerpt] Geneva, Feb 9 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic arrived here Wednesday [9 February] for talks 
with the other two warring parties, amid a growing threat of 
NATO air strikes against his faction. 
  Karadzic was enigmatic as he arrived here, declining all 
comment other than saying "I am only prepared to talk about the 
massacre in Sarajevo" which killed 68 people on Saturday [5 
February]. 
  The new round of talks due Thursday [10 February] has been 
scheduled for weeks, well before the massacre in a Sarajevo 
market place which has sparked intense international pressure 
for air strikes. [passage omitted]
