<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing receipt of a proposed amendment submitted by Indiana as a modification to the State's permanent
regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the Indiana program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation
Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment (number 937) consists of proposed changes to the Indiana Surface Mining
Rules provisions concerning OSM Regulatory Reform I, II, and III issues, required program amendments, and State
initiatives. The primary focus of the amendments is on soil capability and restoration standards, individual civil
penalties, significant/nonsignificant revisions, coal exploration, and performance bonds. The amendment is
intended to resolve outstanding issues that remain present in the approved Indiana program resulting from changes
to the Federal program. The amendment would also incorporate changes desired by the State that address various parts
of the State rules.
