  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 09, BNS -- The number of crimes 
committed by Russian military in Estonia has grown in recent 
months, Tallinn Police Chief Ralf Palo said in a press 
conference today. He said the number was evidently even higher, 
for not all illegal activity has been uncovered. 
  Police have arrested many Russian military suspected of 
crime 
during the past month. 
  On March 8, police arrested two employees of a Russian 
military unit in Tallinn. The men are suspected to have robbed 
a Tallinn resident. 
  A day before, the security police and the police special 
task 
force "K" conducted an operation which resulted in the arrest of 
two men who illegally sold weapons. The suspects had offered to 
sell a consignment of Russian-made TT pistols. One of the men 
was Yuri Terzikyan, noncommissioned officer at the Russian unit 
stationed at Tondi, Tallinn. 
  Early on March 2, two Russian servicemen escaped from the 
correctional isolation chambers of the Tallinn garrison, taking 
two machine guns with 60 cartridges. 
  On March 1 Estonian border guards detained Russian navy 
noncommissioned officer Alexander Yegorov at the border 
checkpoint to Russia in Narva, northeast Estonia, on an attempt 
to take a stolen Lada car out of Estonia. 
  Police had to interfere and stop Russian servicemen when the 
latter in late February started to pull down a holiday home at 
Suurupi near Tallinn. The holiday home had been leased to a 
private company. Charges have been brought against the military 
of the Tondi unit, including for 10,000 [currency not specified] 
in damages to the leaseholder company. 
  Also in February, Estonian police seized 500 kilograms of 
high-power explosive from a Russian noncommissioned officer. 
Experts say the amount was sufficient to explode the World 
Trade Center in New York. The man also had 12,000 pieces of gun 
ammunition which he claimed he intended to sell.
