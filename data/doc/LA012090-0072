SEA VIEW LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
ESTANCIA PUTS FINISHING TOUCH ON TUSTIN'S MISERABLE WEEK 
It's been a tough time for Tustin High School's basketball team, which started 
the week ranked third in the county but lost to Corona del Mar Wednesday. 
Things didn't get any better Friday night, when the Tillers fell to Estancia, 
60-55, to remain winless at home in Sea View League games. 
Estancia got 30 points from senior guard Augustin Heredia, who jumped over, 
leaned into and layed all over Tustin defenders before laying the Tillers (15-4 
overall, 2-2 in league play) to rest. 
Heredia continually drew fouls, stepping to the free-throw line 10 times and 
making all 10 shots. He also had two three-pointers. 
Heredia scored 10 of Estancia's 20 fourth-quarter points to help the Eagles 
(11-7, 2-2) come from four points down, 44-40, at the start of the quarter. 
"He's a good one," Estancia Coach Tim O'Brien said of Heredia. "This is a young 
team. We've got one senior who carries us." 
It seemed as if Tustin carried Heredia. 
One of his two old-fashioned three-point plays came with about four minutes to 
play. It was a 17-foot jumper he sank while balancing on the shoulder of Tustin 
guard David Beilstein. Beilstein was called for the foul and Heredia sank the 
free throw to put Estancia ahead, 50-49. 
Estancia took a 54-52 lead on Heredia's jumper in the lane with just under two 
minutes to play. 
Tustin had a chance to tie when Son Ly fouled Clayton Thomas, but Thomas (14 
points) missed both free throws with 42 seconds left. 
Heredia pushed the ball up court through the pressure and dished to Torrey 
Hammond for the layup to put Estancia on top, 56-52. 
Tustin's Phuong Tran countered with one of his four three-point baskets to cut 
the lead to 56-55 with 18 seconds to play. 
But after Estancia inbounded the ball, Jason Moore was called for an 
intentional foul for grabbing Heredia. 
Heredia sank both free throws to give the Eagles a 58-55 lead with 11 seconds 
to play. He was fouled once more, on the inbounds play, and again sank both 
free throws. 
Estancia had jumped to a 7-0 lead, holding Tustin scoreless until 2 1/2 minutes 
into the game. 
Both teams played intense man-to-man defense throughout. Tustin had trouble 
penetrating Estancia's defense. Center Brian Reider hit a couple of baskets 
inside midway through the second quarter to loosen up Tustin's offense. 
Beilstein hit back-to-back three-point baskets in the Tillers' 14-5 run to get 
them back in the game and end the half trailing, 25-20. 
Tustin took its biggest lead, 30-26, on the strength of its half-court trap 
three minutes into the second half. 
"Win or lose, I don't care," O'Brien said. "We just played hard. I'm just so 
pleased with the way we responded." 
Matt Fuerbringer had 11 points and Paul McDaniel 10 for Estancia. 
Newport Harbor 55, Saddleback 49 -- Eddie Martinez and Craig DeBusk scored 12 
points to lead visiting Newport Harbor (13-6, 2-2). Andra McFarlane scored 14 
and Elton Moore had 12 points and 11 rebounds for Saddleback (13-8, 2-2). 
Corona del Mar 78, University 63 -- Jeff Jackson scored 21 points and Warren 
Johnson 17 to lead visiting Corona del Mar (13-6, 4-0). Bryan Smith scored 15 
for University (5-12, 0-4).
