A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



The Exchange is permitted to list and trade index warrants under CBOE Rule 31.5(E). The Exchange is now proposing to
list and trade index warrants based on the Nikkei 300. The listing and trading of index warrants on the Nikkei 300 would
comply in all respects with CBOE Rule 31.5(E). CBOE has received the Commission's approval to list and trade options
on the Nikkei 300.

Index design. 

The Nikkei 300 is a broad-based, capitalization-weighted index designed to be representative of stocks on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange. It was designed by and is maintained by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. The Index is fully described in SRCBOE9414,
the Exchange's rule filing relating to the listing and trading of options on the Nikkei 300.

Index warrant trading. 

The warrants on the Index would be direct obligations of their issuers and would be cash-settled in U.S. dollars. The
warrants would have either American or European style exercise. Upon exercise, or at the warrant expiration date
in the case of warrants with European style exercise, the holder of a warrant structured as a ``put'' would receive
payment in U.S. dollars to the extent that the index value has declined below a pre-stated cash settlement value. Conversely,
holders of a warrant structured as a ``call'' would, upon exercise or at expiration, receive payment in U.S. dollars
to the extent that the index value has increased above the pre-stated cash settlement value. Warrants that are out-of-the-money
at the time of expiration would expire worthless.



Warrant listing standards and customer safeguards. 

In SRCBOE9008,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 the Exchange established generic listing standards for index warrants, which are contained in CBOE Rule 31.5(E).
The filing also established certain sales practice rules for the trading of index warrants, which are contained in
Chapter IX of the Exchange's Rules. The listing and trading of index warrants on the Nikkei 300 would be subject to those
guidelines and rules.

</FOOTNOTE>


Under Rule 31.5(E), (i) issuers shall meet the CBOE's size and earnings criteria for equity issues and have assets
in excess of $100,000,000; (ii) the term of the warrants shall be for a period ranging from one to five years from the
date of issuance; and (iii) the minimum public distribution of such issues shall be 1,000,000 warrants, together
with a minimum of 400 public holders, and have an aggregate market value of $4,000,000.

Because index warrants are derivative in nature and closely resemble index options, CBOE would also require safeguards
designed to meet the investor protection concerns raised by the trading of index options. The Exchange would require
that index warrants on the Nikkei 300 be sold only to customers whose accounts have been approved for options trading
under CBOE Rule 9.7.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 CBOE Rule 30.50, Interpretation .02 also applies the suitability standards of CBOE Rule 9.9 to recommendations in
index warrants.
