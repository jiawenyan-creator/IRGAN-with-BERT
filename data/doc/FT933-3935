FT  10 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC 'to freeze green rates'
THE EUROPEAN Commission would last night be freezing the 'green' currency
rates rates at which Community-guaranteed farm prices are translated into
national currencies until the end of September, a commission official said
yesterday afternoon, Reuter reports from Brussels.
'There will be no green rate devaluations or revaluations in September,' he
said.
The commission's decision, which followed backing for the move by the EC
agrimonetary committee earlier in the day, would provide some short-term
stability in farm trade, the official said, adding that the situation would
be reviewed before the end of the month.
Farm trade became unstable after all EC currencies were regarded as floating
when fluctuation bands for most units were widened on August 1 in the wake
of the exchange rate mechanism debacle.
The three- and 10-day reference periods for calculating green rates had been
temporarily abandoned and the rates fixed on the basis of exchange rates in
the last 10 days of August, the official explained.
The decision followed pressure from the German government, which was worried
that a possible strengthening of the D-Mark would cause a further cut in
prices for its farmers.
