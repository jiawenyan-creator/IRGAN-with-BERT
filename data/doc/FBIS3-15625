<F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas by </F>
Ruta Grineviciute in Vilnius on 24 February: "A. Brazauskas: I 
Seek Concord and a Better Life for Lithuanian People"] 
  [Excerpts] Exactly one year ago, on 25 February 1993, A. 
Brazauskas became Lithuania's fourth president after taking the 
oath of office at the Seimas [parliament]. On the eve of his 
first anniversary in office, A. Brazauskas answered several 
questions from RESPUBLIKA reporter R. Grineviciute. 
  [Grineviciute] When taking the oath as president, you stated 
that you would be just to everyone. Is it easy to fulfill this 
promise? 
  [Brazauskas] It is not easy, but I am trying to do my best. 
I think that I have freed myself from the influence of 
different political forces over this year. I cannot claim, 
however, that someone used to exert particular influence over me 
earlier. 
  [Grineviciute] According to the Constitution, you will 
"outlive" the current Seimas by two years. Do you expect to 
have support from the parliamentary majority after the next 
Seimas elections? 
  [Brazauskas] The Seimas might "outlive" me. If people follow 
the same logic in the next elections, the Seimas will remain 
moderate. I believe that there will be no such surprises as in 
October 1992 (when the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party won a 
majority -- R.G.). 
  [Grineviciute] You claim that you have freed yourself from 
political influences. Have there been any decisions causing 
protests from the Seimas majority over that time? 
  [Brazauskas] There have been no such reprimands. However, 
there have been some misunderstandings, because I did not sign 
several laws adopted by the Seimas majority. 
  [Grineviciute] You mentioned in your annual report that you 
did not see any qualitative changes among officials. Meanwhile, 
the prime minister has repeatedly said that he will not conduct 
reform in the state management. How do you intend to resolve 
this conflict? 
  [Brazauskas] We maintain that we must preserve stable 
government institutions in terms of their organization. 
However, the problem is their contents -- officials. We have 
inherited the current conditions, and we have not yet defined an 
official's status. However, the Seimas will resolve this issue 
and legalize officials in the better sense of this word by 
adopting a relevant law in March. 
  [Grineviciute] How can corruption be "treated?" 
  [Brazauskas] If such a cure existed, the entire world would 
be free of corruption. This is a common misfortune of all 
government officials. I have repeatedly said that cases of 
corruption must be assessed at courts. I have never defended 
and will not defend a single official who abuses his position. 
  [Grineviciute] What is your key goal as president? What will 
allow you to say -- "My presence was not fruitless?" 
  [Brazauskas] I dream about normal relations among the 
Lithuanian people. The last year shows that they can be 
achieved. Neither I nor the government or the Seimas increase 
tension. As long as I am here, I will try to prevent people's 
artificial opposition. 
  Another of my goals is a better life for the Lithuanian 
people. We can speak about the absence of a concept, but all our 
efforts must be directed at this. [passage omitted] 
  [Grineviciute] How do you assess the now concluding 
negotiations on the treaty with Poland? 
  [Brazauskas] Since I have participated in drafting the 
treaty 
over the past six months, I claim that the desire of both sides 
to find an acceptable solution has prevailed.
