  [Text] Bishkek -- A draft interstate treaty on military 
service by Russian citizens in the Kyrgyz Armed Forces has been 
initialed at a meeting of representatives of the Russian and 
Kyrgyz Defense Ministries held in Bishkek. 
  The signed document will be valid until 31 December 1999. It 
stipulates that Russian servicemen may perform military service 
in the Kyrgyz Army on a contract basis, which means that they 
and their families will retain all the rights and privileges 
granted to Russian servicemen. On completion of service, the 
Kyrgyz Defense Ministry will obtain housing for each Russian 
serviceman (except in Moscow and St. Petersburg). If the 
Russian serviceman remains in Kyrgyzstan, however, the apartment 
he has been living in will be given to him free of charge. 
  In addition, the two countries' ministries reached agreement 
on the procedure for performance of military service by 
officers, warrant officers, servicewomen, and those on extended 
service. Until the end of 1994, they have the right to transfer 
without hindrance to the other state's Army.
