FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Cummins confirms turnround
CUMMINS Engine, the world's largest independent manufacturer of diesel
engines, yesterday announced a big increase in first-quarter earnings and
forecast the second quarter would be even better, writes Martin Dickson.
The figures underscore the turnround at the company, which suffered severely
when the US truck market was hit by the 1991 recession. It reported net
earnings of Dollars 41.1m, or Dollars 2.24 a share, on sales of Dollars
1.05bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 5m, or 20 cents, on sales of
Dollars 881.3m in the same period of last year, excluding accounting
changes.
The figures were better than the Dollars 2-a-share earnings forecast at the
start of this month by the company at its annual meeting.
Cummins said it expected that 'second-quarter sales and earnings will exceed
those of the first quarter, assuming economic conditions do not
deteriorate.'
It said its mid-range engine sales continued to grow as the company finished
its third quarter of shipments to Ford Motor for its medium truck range.
