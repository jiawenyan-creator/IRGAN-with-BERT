<F P=106> [Interview with Valentin Karabashev, deputy prime minister </F>
and minister of trade, by an unidentified STANDART NEWS 
correspondent; place and date not given: "It Is Abnormal for an 
Acting Prime Minister To Be in Charge of the Cabinet for Over 
Two Months"] 
  [Text] [STANDART NEWS] Mr. Karabashev, who is acting as 
prime minister at the moment? 
  [Karabashev] Mr. Matinchev continues to carry out this duty, 
because the prime minister's order of 8 March remains in effect. 
  [STANDART NEWS] Are there any differences between you and 
Mr. 
Matinchev on the issue of when the cabinet should resign? 
  [Karabashev] Matinchev and I have not even discussed this 
question. 
  [STANDART NEWS] Have you suggested that any ministers should 
go? 
  [Karabashev] No. In any case, this would be incorrect and 
the question is hardly likely to be discussed in the prime 
minister's absence. 
  [STANDART NEWS] In fact, people say that you called for the 
special cabinet meeting last Sunday, when Professor Berov was 
present. 
  [Karabashev] At that meeting we discussed the position to be 
adopted by the delegation at the negotiations with the Paris 
Club. 
  [STANDART NEWS] What is your personal view on the issue of 
the cabinet's resignation? 
  [Karabashev] First, from what I know, I cannot say as yet 
how 
long the prime minister will remain absent. I have said 
previously that it is abnormal for the Council of Ministers to 
be without a prime minister for a very long period. However, the 
question of who will act as prime minister -- Matinchev or 
myself -- is not the main issue. 
  [STANDART NEWS] What do you mean by a "very long period"? 
  [Karabashev] I mentioned earlier that a normal period is 
about a month or a month and a half... 
  [STANDART NEWS] ...What about now? 
  [Karabashev] At this moment I have no detailed information 
on 
what is actually happening regarding the prime minister's 
illness. 
  [STANDART NEWS] How long can you go on without a prime 
minister? 
  [Karabashev] Oh, I will tell you that later, when I can no 
longer hold out. 
  [STANDART NEWS] In my view, this depends on whether the 
Council of Ministers does anything or not. It will never be 
idle. In the final analysis, it also depends on how parliament 
reacts. At the moment there is no indication that the majority 
of deputies will withdraw their support from the government for 
this reason. When such an indication appears, the cabinet will 
have to think again. 
  [STANDART NEWS] Does this mean that you will all go when 
parliament tells you? 
  [Karabashev] By and large, yes. The deputies elected us and 
they can topple the cabinet. 
  [STANDART NEWS] Does not Zhan Videnov's statement that the 
cabinet changes will include the deputy prime minister 
constitute such an indication? 
  [Karabashev] This does not concern me particularly. It is a 
signal sent by a deputy, but it is one thing to make some 
signal, in the manner specified under the Constitution for the 
entire government, but it is quite another thing to make some 
sign regarding individual deputy prime ministers. In the second 
case, these signals are not very proper, because the prime 
minister is the only person who can propose personnel changes. 
The former ploy is an attempt to apply some kind of pressure. 
  [STANDART NEWS] What if the ASP [Alternative Social Liberal 
Party] recalls you? 
  [Karabashev] I am not the ASP's representative in the 
cabinet, because the government was formed according to a 
different formula. In fact the ASP has no connection with this 
cabinet and at present is supporting it in some way. At the 
moment no decision has been made to ask the ASP members to leave 
the cabinet. If this call is made, Mr. Bikov and I can reach 
our own decisions on whether to respond or not. I may possibly 
submit my resignation even without such a call -- but this is a 
purely theoretical consideration. 
  I do not regard it as normal for the prime minister not to 
lead his team for a period longer than two months.
