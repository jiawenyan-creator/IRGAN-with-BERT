FT  01 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Preferred securities
For Grand Metropolitan, the benefits of its Dollars 500m issue of preferred
securities are clear. The cleverly-structured issue is in line with the
group's strategy of reducing its dependence on short-term debt. The cost of
financing the new instrument is likely to be 40-50 basis points higher than
that of 30-year debt - a price well worth paying for an instrument which
approximates to equity, and is viewed as such by the rating agencies.
Moreover, the securities enhance accounting measurements of performance such
as interest cover and gearing while being tax-efficient. Despite the
instrument's attractions, preferred securities are aimed primarily at US
retail investors. The appeal of the financing technique to other UK blue
chip companies may thus be limited to those such as GrandMet whose products
are already familiar to the US consumer.
