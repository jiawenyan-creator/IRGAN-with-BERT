  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai reaffirms that he will 
not dissolve the House of Representatives nor to withdraw the 
seven draft constitutional amendments. Prime Minister Chuan 
stated his firm position in his speech to the annual meeting of 
the Democrat Party, of which he is the leader, at the Emerald 
Hotel in Bangkok. While dismissing the idea of house 
dissolution, the prime minister says he does not believe a 
military coup will be resorted to for the solving of political 
problems. However, Prime Minister Chuan says he and his 
government will refrain from instigating a military coup, 
providing no conditions for anyone to stage a coup. He stresses 
that his government has clear policies and has been seriously 
implementing them with definite aims of suppressing corruption 
and promoting democracy in the country. 
  He also confirms that the remaining seven draft amendments 
to 
the constitution will not be withdrawn from the parliament.
