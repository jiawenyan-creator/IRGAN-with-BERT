 

Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
community's views: 
1. What information should the Secretary require on the form to 
supplement the specific information required by the statute? 
&bull;Information should include documentation of an 
institution's accreditation or preaccreditation, 
degree-granting authority, authority to provide 
postsecondary education, and State licensure. 
[Kansas City] 
&bull;With one exception, participants were satisfied that 
information currently collected on the Department's 
application forms is adequate, and new requirements 
would needlessly add burden. One participant 
recommended a separate application for proprietary 
institutions. [New York] 
&bull;Specific categories should be established for different 
types of institutions and academic functions. 
Information should include the names and social 
security numbers of key administrative personnel and 
board members. [San Francisco] 
&bull;Provided that new information required by statute is 
collected (financial statements, description of student 
aid processing at the institution, information on main 
and branch campuses, and information on the 
institution's third-party servicers), information 
currently collected is sufficient. However, additional 
information should be collected on whether an 
institution's owner has had substantial control over a 
closed institution that owes refunds to students or 
lenders. [Atlanta] 
2. Should the Audit Guide be revised to require the auditor to 
verify the information on the application form? 
&bull;Participants recommended no changes in the audit guide. 
[Kansas City, New York, San Francisco, Atlanta] 
&bull;A minority of participants indicated that there should 
be changes, without specifying what changes are needed. 
[Kansas City] 
B. Section 498(c)(1) addresses financial responsibilities and 
requires an institution to show that it is able to provide 
promised services, to provide administrative resources necessary 
to Title IV duties, and the meet all of its financial obligations 
including refunds and repayments to the Secretary for Title IV 
liabilities. 
Issues that the community was asked to address and the 
community's views: 
1. What information should be required from an institution to 
permit the Secretary to determine that the institution provides 
the services described in its official publications and 
statements? 
&bull;No additional information needs to be collected from 
institutions. [Kansas City, San Francisco] 
&bull;If the Secretary needs additional information, the 
Secretary should be able to collect it from data made 
available through State and accrediting functions. 
[Kansas City, New York, Atlanta] 
&bull;The best way to obtain information would be through 
site visits. [New York, Atlanta] 
&bull;The Department needs to take action on institutions 
with failing financial statements, rather than simply 
collect them. [New York] 
&bull;The establishment of uniform financial standards would 
be difficult, because different standards need to apply 
to different types of institutions. [New York]
