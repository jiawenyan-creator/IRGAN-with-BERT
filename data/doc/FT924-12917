FT  17 OCT 92 / Markets: Leeds fixed mortgage offer - At a Glance
Leeds Permanent building society was quick to react to yesterday's base rate
cut, not with a mortgage rate cut of its own but with the introduction of a
new fixed rate mortgage.
The fixed rate is 7.95 per cent for a two year period and replaces the 8.75
per cent fixed rate which was launched last week. The minimum loan is Pounds
15,005 and there is no maximum advance. The mortgage is available on all
types of mortgages with an arrangement fee of Pounds 150. There is a
redemption fee of two months' interest in the first year and one month in
the second year. See Page IV
