  [Text] The Australian Government has criticized the United 
States over maintaining barriers to trade. The criticism 
follows Washington's annual release in March of its report on 
foreign trade barriers, which targeted Australia for allegedly 
retaining trade barriers. 
  However, as Camille Funnel reports, Australia has responded 
by releasing its own report saying America's trade barriers are 
far tougher than Australia's. 
  [Begin Funnel recording] Australia says it is releasing the 
report to counter an inaccurate and unbalanced impression of 
Australian and U.S. trade policies in an annual American trade 
report. 
  The document says the imbalance of trade between Australia 
and the U.S. is over two to one in favor of Washington and is 
larger proportionally than the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. 
The report says the fact that a number of major Australian 
exports are subject to stringent import controls has added to 
the growing imbalance in trade. The report cites America's use 
of limits on the imports of beef, sugar, dairy products, and 
steel, as well as other products. 
  The report is critical of the American Government's 
purchasing policy, its taxes on wine and beer, and restrictions 
in a range of services, such as the aviation industry and 
financial services. [end recording]
