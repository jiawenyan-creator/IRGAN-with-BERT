CASE DROPPED IN DAMAGE TO EMPTY HOUSE; 
CRIME: VANDALISM CHARGES AGAINST THREE TEEN-AGERS WERE DISMISSED BECAUSE THE 
KEY WITNESS DISAPPEARED. 
A San Fernando Municipal Court judge dismissed felony vandalism charges against 
three Valley teen-agers Thursday because the key witness against them has 
disappeared. 
Richard Byrd, 18, of Granada Hills and Kayron Kadjar, 18, and John Walker, 19, 
both of Sepulveda, were accused of causing $10,000 to 20,000 worth of damage to 
an empty Northridge house during a party there Nov. 3. 
But Kevin Johnson, 21, one of the party-goers and the only witness who can 
identify the defendants, has been missing since December. Without his 
testimony, prosecutors do not have sufficient evidence to proceed with the 
case, Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Aveis told Judge Stephen A. Marcus in court 
Thursday. 
Aveis said Johnson "went underground" the day after receiving an intimidating 
phone call from Kadjar's father. But Shapoor Kadjar denies ever speaking to 
Johnson. He said Johnson is afraid of police who threatened to beat him up if 
he did not testify in the case. 
Shapoor Kadjar said Johnson told a private investigator that his son was not 
responsible for the damage, but that police officers were pressuring Johnson to 
testify against him. 
Police arrested Byrd, Kadjar and Walker, and three juveniles on suspicion of 
breaking windows and kicking holes in the walls and doors of a home on Van 
Alden Street. Police said the youths were attending one of the large house 
parties that sometimes attract hundreds of teen-agers in the West Valley. But 
Kadjar said his son was not in the house at the time. 
An advertising flyer said the party would last from "7:30 until the cops come" 
and that guests would be asked for $3 to buy beer and pay for a disc jockey. 
Police said guests were allowed in free because there was no beer or disc 
jockey. They said some teen-agers, angry because there was no beer or music, 
began to vandalize the house.
