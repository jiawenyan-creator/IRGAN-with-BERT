FT  30 MAR 94 / Observer: Chums in the cabinet
Are the chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England,
who hold their monthly monetary meeting today, on first name terms?
And if they are, should the governor - Eddie George - refer to the
chancellor as Kenneth, or Ken? Clarke has only limited control over what
newspapers call him and doesn't appear to have issued edicts on the matter.
But precedents have already been set; lengthy investigation indicates that
in the past year the UK's non-tabloid newspapers have increasingly referred
to the beer-drinking chancellor as 'Ken'. Admittedly, it's only one 'Ken'
per 28 'Kenneths'; but that's a remarkable shift on the previous year's
tally of only one 'Ken' for every 52 'Kenneths'. John Major has taken to
calling him 'Ken', as has the Treasury's Stephen - not 'Steve', note -
Dorrell.
Where will all this vulgar chumminess end? Are we headed for the demotically
inclined Mick Heseltine, Dougie Hurd and Sir Norm Fowler?
