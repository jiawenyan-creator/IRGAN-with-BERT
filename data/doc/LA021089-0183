PLACENTIA'S CHANG OUT OF TOURNEY 
Michael Chang withdrew today from the $350,000 Volvo Chicago tennis tournament 
after hurting his ankle the previous night in a match with Jimmy Connors. 
Sixteen-year-old Chang, of Placentia, was to have faced Argentina's Horatio De 
La Pena in one of four quarterfinal matches later today. 
Chang beat Connors 6-3, 7-6, 7-2 in the second-round match Thursday night. 
"I've played against (Ivan) Lendl, (John) McEnroe and (Henri) LeConte, but 
playing a legend and beating him is not only a thrill, but an honor," he said 
afterward.
