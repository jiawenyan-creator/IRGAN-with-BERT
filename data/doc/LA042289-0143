BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE 
The last name of the spokesman for Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine and its 
parent firm should look familiar. It's Connally, as in John B. Connally, the 
former Texas governor and presidential candidate. 
The spokesman is the former politician's youngest son, Mark M. Connally. Before 
taking on his new duties, the 36-year-old Connally worked for Lincoln's parent 
firm, American Continental Corp., overseeing land development and loan 
administration at its Tucson office for the last 2 years. 
American Continental's chairman, the politically well-connected Charles H. 
Keating Jr., served a short stint as campaign manager for the senior Connally's 
presidential campaign in 1980.
