  [Text] Hangzhou, June 24 (XINHUA) -- An ODS [ozone 
depleting substances] substitutes research center has been set 
up here to help protect the ozone layer and the global 
environment. 
  The main task of the center is to improve the research and 
development of substitutes for ozone depleting substances (ODS), 
by developing new products and technology. 
  The research center was set up on the basis of the chemical 
industry research center in Zhejiang Province under the Ministry 
of Chemical Industry. 
  Zhejiang is an important production base of fluorine raw 
material ore in China. The amount of reserves, production and 
exports account for one-third of the total in the whole country. 
  The Zhejiang Chemical Industry Institute has successfully 
worked out dozens of substitutes for freon that do little harm 
to the ozone layer. Some are under test use and are supplied to 
major refrigerator enterprises. 
  The substitute for another ozone depletion substance -- 
halon, a fire extinguishing agent -- is under development. 
  ODS are mainly used in industrial cooling and electronic 
cleansing devices. When the substances are released into the 
atmosphere they are likely to destroy the ozone layer, which 
absorbs ultra-violet light and reduces the sun's radiation. 
  China is the biggest ODS producer and consumer among the 
developing countries. It joined the Vienna pact for the 
protection of the ozone layer in 1989. 
  In 1992 China drew up its first national program for 
progressively eliminating ozone depleting substances.
