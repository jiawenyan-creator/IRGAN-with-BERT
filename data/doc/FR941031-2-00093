Norfolk Southern Railway Company_Abandonment Exemption_in 
Maryville, TN 



Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NS) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_

Exempt Abandonments 

to abandon a 0.65-mile portion of its line of railroad between mileposts 15.84KA and 16.49KA, in Maryville,
TN. 


NS has certified that: (1) No local or overhead traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) no formal complaint
filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding
cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been
decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (3) the requirements of 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental
report), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication),
and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met. 



As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under


Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 

360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial
revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. 





Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption
will be effective on November 30, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve
environmental issues,

A stay will be issued routinely by the Commission in those proceedings where an informed decision on environmental
issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis in its independent investigation)
cannot be made before the effective date of the notice of exemption. 

See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines,

 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay on environmental concerns is encouraged to file its request as soon
as possible in order to permit the Commission to review and act on the request before the effective date of this exemption.

If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void 

ab initio. 


NS has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environment and historic
resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by November
4, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission,
Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA, at (202) 9276248. Comments on environmental
and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public. 


Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where
appropriate, in a subsequent decision.



Decided: October 21, 1994.
