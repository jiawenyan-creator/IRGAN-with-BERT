FT  19 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
A BOUT of nerves concerning interest rates in both the US and Germany,
worries over the outcome of yesterday's referendum in Denmark on the
Maastricht treaty, and poor economic UK data combined to bring a retreat in
stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,864, around the level of the
previous night's close, but drifted down on concern about the progress of
polling in Denmark and on whether the Bundesbank will reduce interest rates
today.
The release at 11.30am of UK industrial output figures showing a 1.3 per
cent fall served to increase the downward pressure on the contract.
Worries about US interest rates and the poor performance of Wall Street
brought a further decline and June fell to the day's low of 2,854, although
bargain hunting saw it come off the bottom to close at 2,858, around 7
points ahead of its fair value premium to cash. Turnover remained light,
totalling 7,527 lots.
In traded options, volume improved to reach 29,395 contracts, of which 7,163
were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 1,995 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option.
Hanson, which reported figures yesterday, was the busiest stock option at
4,055 lots. It was followed by Marks and Spencer, which also reported
figures, at 2,038. Glaxo, BT and BTR were other active stock options.
