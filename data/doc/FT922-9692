FT  06 MAY 92 / Northern Ireland talks resume
ROUND-TABLE talks between Northern Ireland party leaders on the political
future of the province resumed in Belfast yesterday.
A news blackout was maintained as leaders of the Ulster Unionists,
Democratic Unionists, Social Democratic and Labour party and the Alliance
party arrived at Stormont for the second session under the chairmanship of
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary.
On Monday, Unionists and the SDLP were at loggerheads over the SDLP's
decision to travel to Dublin to brief Irish Prime Minister Mr Albert
Reynolds on the recently restarted search for an agreed system of
devolution.
If the political leaders agree an agenda for the talks, they will meet again
tomorrow and from next week are expected to meet on Mondays, Tuesdays and
Wednesdays.
