FT  07 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian softwood output down
sharply
in normal years more than half total European production - may have fallen
by 30 to 35 per cent in 1991, according to estimates published this week by
the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. Conditions are so
uncertain that no reliable forecast can be made for 1992, the commission
says.
Elsewhere in Europe, and in North America, the UN agency expects a modest
recovery in sawn softwood production and consumption in 1992 after declines
last year. These largely reflected the recession and in particular the
dampening effect of high interest rates on housing construction.
For Europe (excluding Russia), consumption is forecast to rise by 1.3 per
cent to 73.8m cubic metres, and production by 0.9 per cent to 68.2m cu m,
following drops of 8 per cent and 7.4 per cent respectively in 1991.
In North America, much of last year's fall in sawn softwood production and
consumption is likely to be recovered in 1992, the ECE says. It predicts
production this year of 136.4m cum, just 1 per cent below 1990 levels, and
consumption of 120.8m cu m or 2 per cent less than in 1990.
Conditions in the softwood log market in Europe are returning to normal
after the massive clearance of storm-damaged timber in 1990, the ECE notes.
In the longer term, the agency expects that, with international help,
eastern Europe's forest products industries and markets could recover within
a few years.
The European and North American markets for hardwoods are predicted to
follow a similar trend to that of softwoods. In Europe (excluding Russia),
the ECE forecasts increases this year in sawn hardwood consumption and
production of 2.1 per cent (to 21m cu m) and 3.1 per cent (to 17.1m cu m)
after falls of 5.0 and 3.8 per cent respectively in 1991.
It notes that sawn hardwood of temperate species now has over 50 per cent of
the market in Europe. European imports of tropical sawnwood, a target of
environmentalists concerned about unsustainable logging in developing
countries, are estimated to fall by over 17.6 per cent to 2.6m cu m between
1990 and 1992. For logs the drop in tropical hardwood imports in 1990-92 is
expected to be 10.9 per cent to 3.2m cu m.
Looking at wood products, the commission expects a slight upturn in the
market for wood-based panels but notes that recycled paper is competing
successfully with virgin pulp in paper production. Against that, new markets
might be found for wood as a fuel source.
