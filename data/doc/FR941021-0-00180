 

181. While we have already found that common 2 carrier requirements need not be imposed on space segment operators
providing service to resellers, there are several other factors that militate against the imposition of common carrier
requirements, particularly those limiting alien ownership under Section 310(b) of the Communications Act. Specifically,
these systems are inherently global, and extremely expensive. Systems may be comprised of as many as 66 satellites,
only a small number of which are visible over the United States at any one time. Because of their global nature, many
systems are raising capital in international markets.
<FOOTCITE>249</FOOTCITE>
 As such, it is reasonable to expect that investors will want to be involved with system operation, particularly if
the system will be accessed from the investor's jurisdiction. We concur that this foreign participation is likely
to improve the likelihood of receiving a grant of space station access by foreign administrations.

2. System License and License Term


182. As proposed in the Notice, and unanimously endorsed by the parties, we will follow the policy we established in
licensing NVNG MSS systems, which are also composed of constellations of technically identical LEO satellites.
Specifically, we will issue a single ``blanket'' authorization for the construction, launch, and operation of all
the satellites in an entity's constellation. This authorization will cover all construction and launches necessary
to put the complete constellation into place and to maintain it until the end of the license term, including any replacement
satellites necessitated by launch or operational failures, or by the retirement of satellites prior to the end of
the license period. All replacement satellites, however, must be technically identical to those in service and may
not cause a net increase in the number of operating satellites.
<FOOTCITE>250</FOOTCITE>
 This blanket authorization will include any in-orbit spares for which the applicant seeks authorization as part
of its system. Any such spares can be activated as required. Within ten days of activation, the licensee must certify
to the Commission that the activation did not cause it to exceed the total number of operation satellites for which
its system is authorized. Any spares or replacements that do not fall under the blanket authorization will need separate
authorizations to build, launch and operate, but their terms will expire concurrently with the blanket authorization.
As proposed in the Notice, the license will run from the date on which the first space station in the system begins transmissions
and will be valid for a ten-year period.


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
250

</FOOTNAME>
Technically identical satellites must have identical satellite antenna footprints and transmission parameters.
They need not, however, have the identical physical structure or microelectronics.
</FOOTNOTE>


183. Some applicants urge us to permit replacement satellites that are ``functionally equivalent'' to those authorized
or have ``the same particulars of operation,'' to enable them to more readily include evolutions in design into newer
satellites. These are the same proposals and arguments we rejected when we adopted the blanket authorization standards
for NVNG MSS satellites.
<FOOTCITE>251</FOOTCITE>
 In the absence of arguments or evidence demonstrating that the NVNG MSS service is not analogous to the Big LEO service,
we continue to believe our interests in assuring the continued compatibility of the subject systems with other users
of the spectrum outweigh any convenience for licensees in a laxer standard. A modification application to upgrade
satellite design will not be unduly burdensome and should not impede technical innovation.

184. We also deny the request of LQP and Constellation that a licensee be permitted to put ``spare'' satellites into
service under their blanket license in order to enhance their systems. These parties would require only that there
be no overall increase in effective isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.), pfd, or any other sharing criterion,
and argue that this policy would allow licensees to increase path diversity, which can be a significant service improvement
for CDMA systems. We are not convinced by LQP and Constellation that other operators would not be affected by the operation
of facilities that have not been specifically analyzed and appropriately authorized. Accordingly, we affirm our
requirement that any satellites that an applicant wishes to include in its system must be specified in its initial
application or a modification application.
185. We proposed in the Notice that license terms will begin automatically with the first transmission from the first
authorized satellite, and will continue for ten years.
<FOOTCITE>252</FOOTCITE>
 All parties agree with the length of the license term. One party proposes that a license term should commence only after
commencement of actual service or within six months of launch, whichever occurs first. Apparently, the concern is
that the license term will begin to run before a licensee has launched a sufficient number of satellites with which
to begin commercial operations. This overlooks our general policy that, because all transmissions are capable of
causing interference, satellite license terms in all satellite services begin when radio transmissions commence.
We will not treat Big LEO operators differently by permitting them to engage in any transmissions, whether those transmissions
are to test the system's functioning or to provide a fully implemented commercial service, without a valid operating
license. Further, we do not believe that Big LEO operators will be unduly burdened if the license term for the system
begins to run on the date of the first transmission. If fuel is left on the satellite after its license term has expired,
we will entertain a request for special temporary authority to continue to operate if that location has not been assigned
to a new system.
<FOOTCITE>253</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, we adopt our rule as proposed.

This follows the one-step processing and licensing policy that has been used for satellites since 1980. See 1980 Assignment

In the past, we have granted such requests when continued operations will not prevent a state-of-the-art satellite
from taking its place. See, 

e.g.,

 Hughes Communications Galaxy, Inc., 9 FCC Rcd 217 (1994); Hughes Communications Galaxy, Inc., 9 FCC Rcd 218 (1994);
and American Telephone and Telegraph Co., 8 FCC Rcd 8741 (1993).

186. We also proposed a filing window for system replacement applications identical to the one implemented in the
analogous NVNG MSS service. Specifically, we proposed that applications for the next generation Big LEO systems
must be filed no earlier than three months prior to and no later than one month after the end of the seventh year of the
existing license.
<FOOTCITE>254</FOOTCITE>
 Motorola, LQP and Constellation variously contend that some replacement applications could affect other licensees'
rights and thus potentially affected licensees should be able to file replacement applications earlier. No party
has explained, however, why our proposed rules fail to provide adequate opportunity for affected entities to respond
to proposed replacement systems, thus protecting their rights. We will therefore adopt the filing window for replacement
systems as proposed.

187. In the Notice, we stated that we intend to grant replacement applications if frequencies remain available for
use by such systems, consistent with our practice for other satellite services.
<FOOTCITE>255</FOOTCITE>
 Three applicants urge us to adopt an explicit replacement expectancy, with TRW proposing a specific provision that
would provide such an expectancy upon a licensee's consistent regulatory compliance. The Commission, however,
has historically rejected establishing an explicit replacement expectancy for space station systems.
<FOOTCITE>256</FOOTCITE>
 We have repeatedly noted circumstances such as intervening international agreements or changes in technology may
affect our determination as to whether a replacement system would serve the public interest. We assure Big LEO licensees
that given the enormous investment necessary to construct and operate a satellite system, we will consider replacement
applications in this service similar to other satellite services, that is, we will grant authority to implement a
next generation system unless extraordinary circumstances prevent us from doing so.
