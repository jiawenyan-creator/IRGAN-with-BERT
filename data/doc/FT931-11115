FT  04 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Charities fear impact of lottery
CHARITIES could be 'squeezed out of existence' by the National Lottery Bill
if the legislation is not amended, charities warned yesterday.
With MPs meeting for the first time today to begin detailed discussions of
the bill  - which should enable a national lottery to start by the end of
1994  - an intense lobbying campaign is under way to force changes.
Charity operators claim the lottery could reduce their own annual lottery
income of about Pounds 235m a year by Pounds 100m. Money lost on operating
budgets, they say, cannot be replaced by capital project financing envisaged
under the national lottery.
There is particular concern over plans to include an instant 'scratch-card'
element in the lottery, along the lines already run by many charities.
In a letter sent yesterday to MPs, UK Charity Lotteries  - the largest
charitable lottery operator, owned by a consortium of charities  - says the
bill would make the national lottery 'a heavyweight contender in the
marketplace' while throwing 'charitable lotteries into the ring with their
hands tied behind their backs'.
Mr Frank Flannery, chairman of the group, said charities should be helped to
compete for funds by allowing charity lotteries to offer bigger cash
winnings. It says the government must ensure that national lottery operators
do not bind retailers and distributors to exclusive arrangements, denying
charities the chance to sell their own tickets.
