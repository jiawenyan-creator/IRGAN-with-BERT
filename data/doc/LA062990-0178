WORLD; 
SUSPECT IN TOE-SUCKING GIVES UP 
A man has surrendered to police to face toe-sucking charges in two cities. 
Michael R. Wyatt, 29, of Little Rock walked into the Conway police station with 
his attorney. 
He was charged with criminal impersonation and two counts of assault stemming 
from a May 28 incident at a women's apparel shop in Conway, where he posed as a 
therapist and persuaded a woman to let him examine her feet. 
A few hours later, he surrendered in Little Rock and was charged with 
second-degree assault and harassment. Police said Wyatt attempted to suck the 
toes of one woman and massage the foot of another woman June 18. 
He was freed on personal recognizance in both cases and ordered to appear in 
court in July.
