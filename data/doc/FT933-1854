FT  22 SEP 93 / Pay squeeze 'could cost 200,000 jobs'
NEARLY 200,000 more jobs could be lost across the labour market during the
next financial year, the Trades Union Congress says in its analysis of the
government's new public-sector pay policy.
The document will be presented to today's emergency meeting of union leaders
representing Britain's 5.5m public-sector workers.
It says that the government's removal of up to Pounds 3bn from its
previously planned pay bill for 1994-95 will have an adverse effect on
employment. It suggests that the new pay policy will be 'even tougher' than
the government's present 1.5 per cent pay limit that expires in November.
The document suggests that another year of pay restraint will widen the gap
between public and private-sector pay levels, undermine the role of the
public-sector pay review bodies and damage recruitment and job motivation in
the public services.
