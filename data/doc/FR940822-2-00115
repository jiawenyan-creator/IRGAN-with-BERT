National Symposium on Sentencing

: 

The Judicial Response to Crime,

 to enable State and Federal judges, legislators, prosecutors, defense counsel, corrections officials, legal academics,
social science researchers, media representatives, and members of the public to: 
&bull;Evaluate what is known about the impact of current sentencing practices on adult offenders, juvenile offenders
tried as adults, and juvenile offenders, the criminal and juvenile justice systems, and the public's perception
of justice; 
&bull;Explore how changes in sentencing legislation and judicial practices might better accomplish the goals of
sentencing; 
&bull;Identify changes in procedure, new sources of information or education, and other innovations that might
better assure that a sentence serves the judge's intended sentencing goal(s) in a particular case; and 
&bull;Recommend specific changes in law, policy, and procedure that would help courts better accomplish the goals
of sentencing and improve the public's confidence in the justice system. 
Among the topics which could be addressed at the Symposium would be: the impact that Federal and State sentencing guidelines,
mandatory minimums, and other determinate sentencing approaches have had on the courts and other components of the
criminal justice system, the public, and offenders; whether these approaches have fulfilled their envisioned purposes;
whether sentencing innovations (e.g., giving judges greater access to information about the offender, the victim,
and available sentencing options; changed plea bargaining practices; and greater use of intermediate sanctions)
might better assure just and effective sentencing; and whether current sentencing legislation, processes, and
decisions adequately reflect the public's expectations of justice.

National Symposium on Reducing Litigation Delay.

 The Institute has supported over 20 projects examining methods for improving caseflow in various types and levels
of courts, or training judges and court managers on pretrial and trial management. The Institute is interested in
supporting a symposium that would bring together litigation delay researchers, technical assistance providers,
trial and appellate court judges and managers both from courts that have not successfully implemented programs for
improving caseflow and reducing the time to disposition as well as those that have, State court administrators, attorneys,
scholars, and others to synthesize and share the information resulting from the projects funded by the Institute
and others; determine the approaches to pretrial, trial, and individual docket management that appear to be most
effective and the best methods for implementing them; identify the programs that may be needed to assist courts in
further reducing litigation delay; define and prioritize the topics for further research on improving caseflow
management; and encourage and assist courts that are experiencing litigation delay to undertake measures to ensure
the prompt and fair disposition of cases. 
v. 

Scholarships for Judges and Court Personnel.

 The Institute is reserving up to $250,000 (in addition to any scholarship funds remaining from Fiscal Year 1994) to
support a scholarship program for State court judges and court managers. 
(a) 

Program Description/Scholarship Amounts.

 The purposes of the Institute scholarship program are to: enhance the knowledge, skills, and abilities of judges
and court managers; enable State court judges and court managers to attend out-of-State educational programs sponsored
by national and State providers that they could not otherwise attend because of limited State, local and personal
budgets; and provide States, judicial educators, and the Institute with evaluative information on a range of judicial
and court-related education programs. 
Scholarships will be granted to individuals only for the purpose of attending an out-of-State educational program
within the United States. The annual or midyear meeting of a State or national organization of which the applicant
is a member does not qualify as an out-of-State educational program for scholarship purposes, even though it may include
workshops or other training sessions.
