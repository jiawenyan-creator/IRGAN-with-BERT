  [Text] The Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel 
[Vorgan], UNITA's [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola] radio station, is still at the center of talks between 
the government and UNITA. An accord could be signed soon, 
although there are still differences between the government and 
UNITA about Vorgan. UNITA agrees that as a political party it 
cannot operate a radio station. Vorgan will remain in the air 
for the years to come, though with a different format. UNITA 
says it does not have any other means of conveying its message 
within the framework of national reconciliation. 
  Today's talks became bogged down around the news media law 
because the delegations wanted to know who has the monopoly over 
radio broadcasting and who can broadcast on short wave. The 
government, UNITA, the mediator, and the observers had not read 
the law, or pretended to ignore it. So they adjourned for today 
for consultations. Tomorrow they will return to the negotiating 
table, but better equipped. 
  Meanwhile, sources close to the mediator said today that the 
government and UNITA have been considering the reinstatement of 
state administration throughout Angola and UNITA's participation 
at various administrative levels.
