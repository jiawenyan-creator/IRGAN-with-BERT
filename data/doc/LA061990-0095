U.S. Attorney Stephen Markman said Detroit Piston guard Isiah Thomas is not the 
target of a gambling investigation or federal criminal charges. 
"While I am not, of course, able to describe the details of any grand jury 
investigation, given the prominence of Thomas and the attention that this 
matter has received, I would like to clarify the record as best I can at this 
time," Markman said. 
He said Thomas initiated contact with the FBI after a story about the gambling 
investigation was aired Friday, and he said Thomas has cooperated in the 
ongoing investigation. 
The report, based on anonymous sources, said checks made out to Thomas were 
cashed at a grocery store owned by a man being investigated for money 
laundering.
