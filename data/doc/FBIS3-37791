  [Text] Bonn February 22 TASS -- High-ranking diplomats met 
in Bad-Godesberg in the neighbourhood of Bonn on Tuesday to look 
for new ways of reaching political settlement of the Bosnian 
crisis. Taking part in the meeting are heads of diplomatic 
agencies of Russia, the United States, member-states of the 
European Union, Canada and a U.N. delegation. The Russian 
delegation to the forum is led by special envoy of the Russian 
president and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, Vitaliy Churkin. 
  Local diplomats say that the meeting has a purely working 
character. Participants are planned to discuss possibilities of 
applying measures, used for the withdrawal of heavy weapons, to 
other Bosnian regions and problems of stepping up relief 
supplies to the peaceful population of the republic. 
  An official press-release issued by the German Foreign 
Ministry says that the purpose of the meeting is to give a joint 
assessment of the political and military situation in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina on the whole. It is necessary to take advantage of 
a favorable moment in order to take joint and coordinated 
actions to improve a dangerous situation in which people in 
Sarajevo and other regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina found 
themselves, the press release said. 
  Diplomatic circles in Bonn pointed out that the meeting on 
the Bosnian crisis had been initiated by German Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel. Last Thursday [17 February], after consultations 
in Athens, heads of Russian and German Foreign Ministries 
suggested an idea of holding such a conference in a joint 
telephone conversation with the U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. 
  Later, this idea acquired a more concrete character in 
telephone conversations between the German foreign minister and 
his counterparts from EC countries and Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev.
