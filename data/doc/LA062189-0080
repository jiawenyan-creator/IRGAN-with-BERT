METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VICTIM SLAMS DOOR IN GUNMAN'S FACE 
An attempt by an armed robber in Lakewood to steal a man's car was foiled when 
the victim slammed his door shut in the suspect's face, authorities said 
Tuesday. 
The robber had knocked on the front door of a house on Hyter Avenue at 10:30 
p.m. Monday and was answered by the resident, George Wilder, 50, Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Deputy Dan Cox said. 
With the door open, the robber pointed a sawed-off shotgun at Wilder and 
demanded the keys to his car, Cox said. Instead, Wilder slammed the door in the 
robber's face. The robber fired a round through the door but missed Wilder, Cox 
said. 
Hubert Rouse, a California Highway Patrol officer who was off duty and lives 
nearby, confronted the gunman and two alleged accomplices. 
The three men fled after Rouse fired a shot, but deputies later captured the 
alleged accomplices -- Troy Black, 27, of Lakewood, and Dana Smith, 21, of Los 
Angeles, and booked them for investigation of robbery. The gunman was still at 
large.
