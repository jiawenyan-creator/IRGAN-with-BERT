8 HOSTAGES RELEASED AT YELLOWSTONE PARK 
A gunman took eight people hostage in the visitor's center at the Old Faithful 
complex in Yellowstone National Park on Friday, but released them unharmed, the 
National Park Service said. The man surrendered to park rangers a few hours 
later. 
The eight hostages were freed about 6 p.m., almost three hours after the man, 
identified as Brett Hartley, 18, of Baton Rouge, La., drew a handgun at the 
visitor's center, said Interior Department spokesman Steve Goldstein. No shots 
were fired. 
The hostage-taking "was an expression of asking for help. Some people have a 
hard time asking for help," said park ranger Joe Evans. He said officers had 
weapons trained on the gunman until the hostages were released. 
Officials said Hartley would be taken to a hospital at Jackson, Wyo., for a 
preliminary psychiatric examination.
