THE STATE 
Orange County supervisors rejected a proposed ordinance that would have banned 
discrimination against AIDS victims, making the county the only major urban 
area in California without such a measure. The 3-2 vote before a tense and 
emotional crowd capped an 18-month study by the county's HIV Advisory Committee 
that concluded that the ordinance was necessary to reduce the spread of 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome by making its victims more likely to seek 
treatment. Opposition was led by the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon's Anaheim-based 
Traditional Values Coalition.
