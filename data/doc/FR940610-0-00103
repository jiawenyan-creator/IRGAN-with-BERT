 

(a) 

General actuarial valuations.

 (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section and in 1.75203 (relating to exceptions to the use of
prescribed tables under certain circumstances), in the case of certain transactions after April 30, 1989, subject
to income tax, the fair market value of annuities, interests for life or for a term of years (including unitrust interests),
remainders, and reversions is their present value determined under this section. See 20.20317(d)
(and, for certain prior periods, 20.20317A) of this chapter, Estate Tax Regulations, for the computation
of the value of annuities, unitrust interests, life estates, terms for years, remainders, and reversions, other
than interests described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section.

(2) For a transfer to a pooled income fund after April 30, 1989, see 1.642(c)6(e) (or, for certain prior
periods, 1.642(c)6A) with respect to the valuation of the remainder interest.

(3) For a transfer to a charitable remainder annuity trust after April 30, 1989, see 1.6642 with respect
to the valuation of the remainder interest. See 1.6644 (or, for certain prior periods, 1.6644A)
with respect to the valuation of the remainder interest in property transferred to a charitable remainder unitrust.

Components of valuation_

(1) 

Interest rate component_

(i) 

Section 7520 Interest rate.

 The section 7520 interest rate is the rate of return, rounded to the nearest two-tenths of one percent, that is equal
to 120 percent of the applicable Federal mid-term rate, compounded annually, for purposes of section 1274(d)(1),
for the month in which the valuation date falls. In rounding the rate to the nearest two-tenths of a percent, any rate
that is midway between one two-tenths of a percent and another is rounded up to the higher of those two rates. For example,
if 120 percent of the applicable Federal mid-term rate is 10.30, the section 7520 interest rate component is 10.4.
The section 7520 interest rate is published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service in the Internal Revenue Bulletin
(see 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter).

(ii) 

Valuation date.

 Except as provided in 1.75202, the valuation date is the date on which the transaction takes place.

(2) 

Mortality component.

 The mortality component reflects the mortality data most recently available from the United States census. As new
mortality data becomes available after each decennial census, the mortality component described in this section
will be revised periodically and the revised mortality component tables will be published in the regulations at that
time. For transactions with valuation dates after April 30, 1989, the mortality component table (Table 80CNSMT)
is contained in 20.20317(d) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations). See 20.20317A
for mortality component tables applicable to transactions for which the valuation date falls before May 1, 1989.

(c) 

Tables.

 The present value on the valuation date of an annuity, life estate, term of years, remainder, or reversion is computed
by using the section 7520 interest rate component that is described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the mortality
component that is described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Actuarial factors for determining these present
values are included in tables in these regulations and in publications by the Internal Revenue Service. If a special
factor is required in order to value an interest, the Internal Revenue Service will furnish the factor upon a request
for a ruling. The request for a ruling must be accompanied by a recitation of the facts, including the date of birth for
each measuring life and copies of relevant instruments. A request for a ruling must comply with the instructions for
requesting a ruling published periodically in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Rev. Proc. 941, 19941
I.R.B. 10, and subsequent updates, and 601.201 and 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this chapter) and include payment of the required user fee.

(1) 

Regulation sections containing tables with interest rates between 4.2 and 14 percent.

 Section 1.642(c)6(e)(4) contains Table S used for determining the present value of a single life remainder
interest in a pooled income fund as defined in 1.642(c)5. Section 1.6644(e)(6) contains Table
D (actuarial factors used in determining the present value of a remainder interest postponed for a term of years),
Table U(1) (actuarial factors for one life), and Table F (payout factors) used in determining the present value of
a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust as defined in 1.6643. Section 20.20317(d)(6)
of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) contains Table S (actuarial factors for one life), Table B (actuarial factors
used in determining the present value of an interest for a term of years), Table K (annuity end-of-interval adjustment
factors), Table J (term certain annuity beginning-of-interval adjustment factors), and Table 80CNSMT (mortality
components) used in determining the present value of annuities, life estates, remainders, and reversions. The regulations
will be revised periodically to include new mortality component tables and new tables of factors.

(2) 

Internal Revenue Service publications containing tables with interest rates between 2.2 and 26 percent.

 The following documents (with the exception of Publication 1459) have been published for sale by the Superintendent
of Documents, United States Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402:

(i) Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457, ``Actuarial Values, Alpha Volume,'' (8/89). This publication includes
tables of valuation factors, as well as examples that show how to compute other valuation factors, for determining
the present value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and reversions, measured by one or two lives.
These factors may also be used in the valuation of interests in a charitable remainder annuity trust as defined in 1.6642
of this chapter and a pooled income fund as defined in 1.642(c)5 of this chapter.
