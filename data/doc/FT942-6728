FT  28 MAY 94 / International Company News: Fanuc's annual pre-tax earnings
decline 21.4%
Fanuc, the world's largest maker of numerically controlled machine tools,
yesterday reported a 21.4 per cent decline in pre-tax profits for the year
ended March.
The group, a bell-weather of Japanese industrial investment, attributed the
fall to a decline in demand caused by Japan's recession, but forecast stable
taxable profts in the current year.
Profits fell to Y22.99bn (Dollars 219m) in 1993, from Y29.23bn a year
earlier, a slowdown on 1992's 44 per cent profits fall. Fanuc estimates
pre-tax earnings will reach Y23bn in the current year.
Sales fell by 9.8 per cent to Y106.16bn last year and are forecast to rise
slightly to Y107bn this year.
