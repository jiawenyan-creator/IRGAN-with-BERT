FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Conseco reduces Kemper offer
The fate of Kemper, the US financial services group, was thrown into doubt
as Conseco, the Indiana-based insurer, reduced the value of its bid for the
company.
The move could open the way for a renewed takeover approach from GE Capital,
the financial services arm of General Electric, or another buyer.
The lower offer, which values Kemper at Dollars 2.4bn, has been made because
the original offer probably would not win the support of Conseco's
shareholders, said Mr Stephen Hilbert, Conseco's chairman and chief
executive.
Many shareholders are believed to be unhappy that a fall in Conseco's share
price since June, when the original offer was made, would leave Kemper
shareholders with a far bigger proportion of the enlarged group once the
deal was completed.
The revised offer valued Kemper at Dollars 60 a share, Dollars 5 a share
less than the earlier bid.
GE Capital's offer of Dollars 60 a share in cash for Kemper in May was
rejected by Kemper's board as inadequate. The decision to spurn that bid
means it will be difficult for Kemper's directors to accept Conseco's lower
offer without facing lawsuits from shareholders.
Conseco said it had proposed the new offer to Kemper, but that its initial
offer remained in effect.
The cash portion in Conseco's revised bid is unchanged, at Dollars 56 a
share. But Kemper shareholders will now be offered fewer Conseco shares.
Under the new bid, Kemper shareholders would receive 0.1087 of a Conseco
share, in addition to the cash, leaving them with about 17 per cent of the
enlarged group.
