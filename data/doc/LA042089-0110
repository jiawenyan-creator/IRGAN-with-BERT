Orange County officials have denied fault in a pool accident in which one child 
died and two others suffered severe brain damage at an unlicensed day-care 
center at a North Tustin home. A $10-million claim filed against the county 
asserts that officials did nothing to prevent the March 30 accident and failed 
to follow up on shutdown orders issued to operators of the center. "We followed 
the law," Dianne Edwards, chief of day-care licensing for the county Social 
Services Agency, said. "The responsibility lies with the care providers and 
with the parents whose children were placed there, not with the county." The 
claim was filed by Timothy and Sandra Polsfoot, whose 19-month-old daughter 
remains comatose. Such claims must be filed before a lawsuit can be initiated 
against the county. The Polsfoots have already sued for unspecified damages 
from Orvel and Diana Brooks, who were twice ordered by the county to close the 
center.
