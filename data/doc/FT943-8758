FT  16 AUG 94 / Albanian trial adjourned
The trial of five Albanian ethnic Greeks was adjourned yesterday after the
prosecution dropped charges of treason against them, saying it could no
longer use the country's old penal code to interpret some activities. Greece
had alleged the trial would be unjust as the Albanian penal code was used by
the former Stalinist administration. The other charges against the five, of
military espionage for the Greek secret service and the illegal possession
of weapons, remained in force. The five accused, who have pleaded not
guilty, were arrested last April after a border incident in which two
Albanian conscripts were killed inside Albania. Albania accused Greece of
staging a cross-border raid, prompting angry denials from Athens.
