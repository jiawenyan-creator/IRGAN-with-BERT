  [Text] Paraguay's and Uruguay's intention to create an 
Export Processing Zone [EPZ] within Mercosur [Common Market of 
the South] has caused turbulence in Brazilian-Uruguayan 
negotiations over the creation of a South American Free Trade 
Area. 
  Uruguay has questioned the domestic components index of the 
products to be traded within Mercosur, fearing that its 
incipient industry might be devastated by Argentine and 
Brazilian competition. As compensation, it asked for the 
creation of an EPZ. The Brazilian Government does not agree to 
this, as it would deactivate the Manaus duty-free zone.
