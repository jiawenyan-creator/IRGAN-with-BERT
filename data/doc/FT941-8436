FT  19 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow plunges on free fall in
long bonds
Wall Street
US blue-chip stocks plunged yesterday as longer-dated US bond prices went
into a free fall for the second day running, writes Frank McGurty in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 35.18 lower at 3,887.46. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was steadier, closing down 2.66 at
467.68. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite fell 3.51 to
470.95, and the Nasdaq composite 1.39 to 788.85.
NYSE volume, at 289m shares, was moderate. Declines led advances, 1,411 to
699.
Two sharp swings in the Dow industrial index the previous session brought a
subdued tone to the opening. Stocks drifted lower as investors mulled over
the bond market's perplexing reaction to Thursday's mixed signals on
inflation.
In spite of a favourable reading on consumer prices, traders chose to focus
on a second-tier regional report suggesting higher prices paid by
manufacturers. Analysts interpreted the subsequent sell-off as the most
convincing demonstration of a change in sentiment since the Federal Reserve
took a first step in tightening monetary policy two weeks ago.
As the financial markets looked ahead to Tuesday's congressional appearance
by the Fed chairman, Mr Alan Green span, bonds tumbled once again yesterday.
By the close, the 30-year government issue was bid down 1 1/32 to 95 5/32 ,
after sliding a point the previous session. The blue chips followed closely
behind, falling by as many as 40 points before regrouping and retracing some
ground.
When the closing bell sounded, all but three of the 30 Dow industrial
components were showing declines. The exceptions were Sears, up Dollars  7/8
at Dollars 46 7/8 , DuPont, up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 54 7/8 , and
Woolworth, unchanged at Dollars 24. Among the biggest losers, 3M dropped
Dollars 2 to Dollars 105, McDonald's shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 60 1/2
and Disney Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 45 3/8 .
Paramount Communications was Dollars 1 1/4 lower at 75 amid investors'
misgivings about its pending merger with Viacom. The latter's B shares fell
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 25 5/8 , while Blockbuster Entertainment, Viacom's
ally, added Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 24 1/2 .
Some semiconductor stocks were better after Mr Rajiv Chaudri, a Goldman
Sachs analyst, said prices for DRAM chips were firming. Micron Technologies
jumped Dollars 3 7/8 to a new 52-week high of Dollars 65 1/2 , while Texas
Instruments shot up Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 79 1/4 .
Brazil
Sao Paulo dropped 9.2 per cent at the close, hit by heavy profit-taking
sparked by renewed concerns over the approval by Congress of economy
minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's social welfare fund proposal.
The Bovespa index ended 960 down at 9,449 points.
The market was ripe for some profit-taking and portfolio-squaring ahead of
Monday's options settlement, but analysts said today's drop came as a
surprise.
Canada
Toronto's stock prices closed lower in relatively light trading as shaky
bond markets continued to drive down North American equities.
The TSE-300 Composite index fell 28.89 points, or 0.66 per cent, to close at
4,378.39. Volume was about 59.2m shares, down from yesterday's 82.2m.
The Composite index finished the see-saw week down about 27 points.
