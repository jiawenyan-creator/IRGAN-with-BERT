Airworthiness Directives; Canadair Model Turboprop CL2156B11 Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL2156B11
series airplanes, that requires inspections to detect cracking in the rear engine mount struts, and replacement
of struts with new struts, if necessary; and the eventual replacement of all struts with new struts. This amendment
is prompted by reports of failures of these rear engine mount struts due to cracking that was caused by rosette welds
on the shank of the struts not achieving full weld penetration during manufacture. The actions specified by this AD
are intended to prevent failure of the rear engine mount struts, which could subsequently result in reduced structural
integrity of the nacelle and engine support structure.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Effective April 4, 1994.




The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the
Federal Register as of April 4, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Canadair Model CL2156B11 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 13, 1993 (58 FR 52931). That action proposed to require repetitive visual inspections to detect cracking
in the rear engine mount struts, and replacement of struts with new struts, if necessary. That action also proposed
to require the eventual replacement of all struts with new struts; such replacement would constitute terminating
action for the visual inspections.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 

Currently, there are no Canadair Model CL2156B11 series airplanes on the U.S. Register. However, should
an affected airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it would take approximately 10 work
hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the AD will be $550 per airplane. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 


For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption
