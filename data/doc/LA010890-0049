PREGNANCY DIABETES 
Question: If a woman is found to have diabetes when she becomes pregnant for 
the first time, does that mean she'll probably have the same problem each time 
she becomes pregnant? 
Answer: It is estimated that about one-third of women who develop diabetes 
during one pregnancy will not have a recurrence during a subsequent pregnancy. 
Some of the reasons suggested to explain this are changes in diet, exercise 
habits, the degree of stress they may be subjected to and other life-style 
factors that may affect diabetes. 
Women who develop diabetes during one pregnancy as well as during a subsequent 
pregnancy are more likely to be heavier than women who don't.

before a game. This would reduce the risk of corneal abrasions, which are quite 
common.
