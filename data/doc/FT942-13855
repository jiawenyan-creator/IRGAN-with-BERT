FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Four Seasons sale by year-end
Four Seasons Hotels, the Canadian luxury chain, says it has had over 50
initial inquiries from buyers interested in acquiring the group, and expects
to conclude a deal by the end of the year, writes Michael Skapinker.
Four Seasons is seeking a buyer because Mr Isadore Sharp, its founder and
controlling shareholder, wants to loosen his ties with the group over the
next three to five years. Mr Sharp and his family own 18 per cent of the
group's shares, but control 70 per cent of the votes.
