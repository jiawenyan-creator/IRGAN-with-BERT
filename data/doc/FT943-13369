FT  20 JUL 94 / Manchester Airport claims lead over Gatwick
Manchester Airport yesterday claimed it has established a clear lead over
London's Gatwick Airport in the holiday flight market, Ian Hamilton Fazey
writes.
Figures produced by Stats MR, an independent company, gave Manchester 29.4
per cent of the market in June, compared with Gatwick's 25 per cent.
In June passenger traffic was up 14.6 per cent on the same month last year,
at 1.57m. The total for the second quarter was 3.92m, 13 per cent up on the
same period in 1993.
June's charter traffic - nearly all holidays - was 1.03m passengers, a rise
of 15.4 per cent on the same month last year.
The airport said it had established a faster trend of growth than Gatwick.
Share of the holiday market in June last year was 28.4 per cent for
Manchester and 27.7 per cent for Gatwick.
'The holiday market has been expanding more quickly in the regions than in
London,' the airport said.
'The operators like it because most bookings in the north are made well in
advance and remain firm. London has comparatively more last-minute bookings,
so the average yield per flight tends to be lower.'
