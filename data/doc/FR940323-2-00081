Title:

 Evaluation of The Transitional Living Program (TLP) for Homeless Youth. 



OMB No.:

 0980-New OMB Request. 



Description: 

The Transitional Living Program (TLP) for Homeless Youth is authorized under the Runaway Youth Act, Title III of the
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) of 1974, as amended in 1988. The legislation requires the
Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to submit an annual report to Congress on the status
and accomplishments of the TLP projects (Title III, part D, sec. 361(b)).

The goal of the TLP is to promote transition to selfsufficient living and to prevent long-term dependency on social
services. TLP is implemented through grants to public entities (State and local governments) and to private, non-profit
organizations. In 1990, 45 projects were funded, 32 were funded in 1991, and 9 were funded in 1992. Each grant is for
a 3-year period, with annual continuation renewals required. 

The evaluation focuses on measuring three types of particular outcomes: (1) Self-sufficiency, (2) independent
living, and (3) personal income. The central feature of the participant impact evaluation design is a prospective
study of TLP participants, in comparison with similar homeless youth in the same communities. The purpose of studying
comparison groups is to measure what might have happened to participant youth had they not participated in the program.
The impact evaluation will be conducted at 10 sites. Participant data will be collected using project management
information systems and instruments adapted from other concurrent studies, to the extent possible.
