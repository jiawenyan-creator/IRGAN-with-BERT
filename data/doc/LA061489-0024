DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: N. HOLLYWOOD MAN GUILTY OF FATAL SHOOTING 
A San Fernando Superior Court jury convicted a North Hollywood man of 
first-degree murder Tuesday in the shooting death of another man outside a bar. 
After deliberating just two hours, the jury found Daniel Vasquez, 28, guilty of 
murdering Mario Rivas, 31, also of North Hollywood, on May 14, 1988, outside a 
bar at the intersection of Burbank Boulevard and Cleon Boulevards. 
A second jury is deliberating the case of Jose Vasquez, who also is charged 
with first-degree murder in Rivas' death. Jose Vasquez is no relation to Daniel 
Vasquez. 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Janice L. Maurizi said that Daniel Vasquez apparently 
mistook Rivas for another man with whom he had quarreled inside the bar before 
it closed. Rivas was shot in the back as he attempted to flee the scene. 
Daniel Vasquez faces 27 years to life imprisonment and will be sentenced July 
6. After sentencing, he will be sent to Oregon and Washington, where he is 
wanted in other murders, Maurizi said.
