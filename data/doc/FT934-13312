FT  22 OCT 93 / People: A fresh slice
From snacks to sandwiches could be the motto of David Garman, currently
managing director of KP Foods UK, a division of United Biscuits. For he is
moving to Associated British Foods, where from November 1 he will be
managing director of Allied Bakers, a division of UB.
Twenty years with United Biscuits, Garman, 41, says he is looking forward to
running a business with some of the most famous brand names in the rather
unglamorous world of bread. Sunblest, Vitbe, Allison are all familiar names,
and Garman  - a history graduate of King's College, London University  -
will be working hard to build on their powerful past associations.
Garman has been in charge of KP Foods' UK operations, which have a turnover
of some Pounds 400m annually, since January this year. He says he was
tempted to move to Allied Bakers by the increased scale of the operations he
would be handling. Allied has been considering the appointment for the past
18 months, following the death of Allied's previous managing director, Henry
Jackson, in a car accident.
'United Biscuits has a very good reputation for management development and
training, and I have a wide experience gained from being involved in a
number of the group's operations. But the size of the challenge at Allied,
the characteristics of the market, encouraged to me to move across,' says
Garman.
