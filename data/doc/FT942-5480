FT  04 JUN 94 / Blair says Scottish devolution a high priority for Labour
A Labour government would establish a Scottish parliament with 'strong'
powers over economic development and domestic affairs, Mr Tony Blair said in
Dundee yesterday. Mr Blair, the most likely successor to John Smith as
Labour leader, said a Scottish parliament was 'more vital than ever to
ensure that Scotland's voice is heard in Europe'.
His comments confirm that devolution remains a high priority for Labour, in
spite of the death of Mr Smith, one of the strongest supporters of a
Scottish parliament.
An opinion poll in Scotland today shows a 43-point Labour lead over the
Conservatives, who scored a record low of 10 per cent.
The System Three poll in Glasgow's The Herald newspaper suggests Labour has
gained nine points in a month, to 53 per cent, with the Tories down four
points.
The poll shows the Scottish National party still in second place with 24 per
cent, a fall of three points from last month, with the Liberal Democrats on
12 per cent, down two points.
The survey questioned 983 people in 38 Scottish constituencies from May 26
to 31.
