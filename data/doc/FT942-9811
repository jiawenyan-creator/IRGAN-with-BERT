FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: ECC reveals demerger details - Camas
expected to be valued at between Pounds 230m and Pounds 260m
Details of the stock market launch of Britain's fifth largest aggregates
company, with sales last year of Pounds 365.2m and net assets of Pounds
224.4m, were announced yesterday by English China Clays, which is demerging
its building materials business.
Dealings in Camas - an acronym of Construction, Aggregates, Materials and
Services - are to start on June 1, if the demerger is approved by
shareholders at an extraordinary meeting on May 31.
They are being offered one Camas share for every ECC share currently held.
ADR holders will also receive Camas shares.
Mr Malcolm Brown of James Capel, the brokers, said yesterday he expected
Camas shares to open at 75p to 85p, valuing the company at between Pounds
230m and Pounds 260m.
The company initially had been looking for an opening value approaching
Pounds 300m, before the recent slide in construction and building material
share prices.
Camas last year made pre-tax profits of Pounds 11m (Pounds 6.4m), generating
notional earnings per share of 3.03p after allowing for a 16 per cent tax
charge due to beneficial deferred taxation arrangements.
A more normal tax charge of 27 per cent would have produced earnings of
2.6p.
Mr Alan Shearer, Camas chief executive, said a total dividend of at least
3.75p was planned this year.
Assuming an 80p opening price, this would put the shares on a yield of
nearly 6 per cent and an historic p/e of 30 on the higher tax charge.
At the end of December, Camas had net debt of Pounds 66.7m, representing
gearing of 29.7 per cent. Net debt is expected to have risen to Pounds 88m
when the demerger is completed.
Four fifths of total sales were achieved in Europe, mostly in the UK. The
company also operates in the US in Colorado, Minnesota and North Dakota.
Europe generated profits of Pounds 9.9m before central overheads,
representing 4.9 per cent of sales of Pounds 292m. This compared with
margins of 17 per cent in 1989, when the UK construction market was at its
peak.
US profits, however, have improved, helped by the construction of a large
new airport at Denver, rising to Pounds 8m, equivalent to 10.9 per cent of
sales of Pounds 73.2m. This compares with margins of 4.4 per cent, producing
profits of Pounds 1.1m in 1989.
Mr Shearer said markets on both sides of the Atlantic were recovering. The
company's prices in the UK had been increased by an average of between 5 and
7 per cent in March, while sales volume in the UK was expected to rise by 1
per cent this year.
The company, in addition to producing aggregates, manufactures concrete
products and is a leading asphalt contractor in the UK.
