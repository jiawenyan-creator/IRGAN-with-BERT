FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Clarke director rejects allegations
A DIRECTOR of Clarke Foods, the ice-cream manufacturer which went into
receivership in October, yesterday rejected suggestions that he sold shares
illegally in the months preceding the group's collapse.
Mr Martin Riley, a non-executive director, was responding to the call for an
inquiry into Clarke from Mr George Howarth, Labour MP for Knowsely North. Mr
Howarth also urged an inquiry into share sales by Mr Riley and Mr Henry
Clarke, chairman, in May, at 160p, three weeks before they began a decline
to the suspension price of 8p.
Clarke shares had enjoyed a sharp rise in the spring, jumping by 35 per cent
between the general election and the end of May, in spite of difficulties
with the installation of equipment. The market rose only 16 per cent in the
same period.
Mr Riley said last night that there was 'absolutely no question of insider
dealing'. He said the stock market had 'shot up in the post-election
euphoria' and he felt the market had been overvalued.
Mr Riley sold 100,000 shares from his pension fund leaving him with 185,000
shares in a personal holding.
Mr Clarke was not contactable last night. However, the same day as Mr Riley,
he sold 210,000 shares from his pension fund, leaving him with 7.1m shares.
