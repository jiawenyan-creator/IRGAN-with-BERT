 

EPA received numerous comments requesting an extension of the withdrawal date for analytical methods. The suggested
dates ranged from July 1, 1995, to July 1, 2000. Based on these comments, EPA will extend the methods withdrawal date
from July 1, 1995, to July 1, 1996 (or 18 months from publication, whichever is later), which is beyond the withdrawal
date suggested by most commenters. New methods or new versions of current methods will be approved within 30 days of
publication of the rule. This overlap in approval dates for new methods and withdrawal of obsolete methods will give
laboratories sufficient time to become certified with the new methods.



Comments on Withdrawal of Specific Methods





Packed-Column EPA Methods 

Commenters generally favored withdrawal of packed column methods for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and trihalomethanes
(THMs), and replacing them with technologically advanced capillary column methods. Additional costs incurred
in supporting older, obsolete methods until EPA withdraws these methods, and the suitability of capillary columns
to handle the increasing number of regulated contaminants were cited as reasons for supporting withdrawal. The July
1, 1995, withdrawal date may be too early, as pointed out by some commenters. EPA will extend the date to July 1, 1996
(or 18 months from publication, whichever is later), to give laboratories more time to plan an orderly transition
to capillary column methods.

Some commenters asked EPA for continuation of the use of packed-column methods, if they meet current regulatory requirements.
EPA feels that packed-column methods have many drawbacks. For example, the cis and trans dichloroethene isomers
cannot be separated with the packed-columns specified for VOC analysis (Lyter, 1994). Such separation problems
with packed-column methods have limited EPA's ability to prepare samples for EPA's laboratory performance evaluation
(PE) program. To accommodate packed-column methods, separate PE samples are prepared for THMs and VOCs to minimize
THM and VOC interferences that users of packed column EPA methods will experience. If only capillary columns are approved,
EPA will have more latitude to mix VOCs and THMs in PE samples to better test laboratories with concentrations and mixtures
of THMs and VOCs, as might realistically occur in drinking waters. EPA notes that laboratories may continue to use
packed column methods for other than compliance monitoring analyses, such as routine plant operation or source evaluation
samples.

A commenter asked why EPA proposed to withdraw THM Methods 501.1 and 501.2 in the 1993 proposal, but subsequently proposed
to continue approval of these packed column methods in the Information Collection Rule (ICR) (59 FR 6354 and 64136414,
February 10, 1994). In today's rule, EPA is clarifying why and how Methods 501.1 and 501.2 can and should be withdrawn
without affecting analytical needs that were described in the ICR proposal. In the ICR, EPA proposed Methods 501.1
and 501.2 only because ICR data must be gathered quickly to support pending disinfectant byproduct control regulations.
To support these regulations, EPA proposed to conduct THM monitoring at a limited number of PWS for eighteen months
beginning in 1995. Since this data must be collected by laboratories certified to conduct THM analyses, it could be
a hardship to revoke the certification of laboratories now using Methods 501.1 and 501.2. EPA notes that EPA also proposed
and encouraged laboratories to use one of the capillary column methods (EPA Methods 502.2, 524.2 and 551) to conduct
THM monitoring for the ICR. And in a subsequent disinfection byproduct rule (59 FR 38668, July 29, 1994) EPA proposed
only capillary methods for THM compliance monitoring (59 FR 38821).

As explained in the 1993 proposal and in the 1992 THM methods rule (58 FR 41344, August 3, 1993), EPA intends to and will
withdraw packed column methods for THM and VOC compliance analysis. To accommodate the special and immediate information
collection needs of the ICR, EPA is deferring withdrawal of packed column Methods 501.1 and 501.2 until July 1, 1996
(or 18 months after publication, whichever is later). This date is expected to be after the beginning of the proposed
ICR monitoring period. When the ICR rule is promulgated, certification under Methods 501.1 and 501.2 will be granted
such that the withdrawal date will not impede collection of THM data for the ICR.
