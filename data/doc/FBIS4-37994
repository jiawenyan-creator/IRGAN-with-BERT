<F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source at the Ministry </F>
of Defense of the Democratic Republic of Yemen"; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] The forces of the ruling military regime in Sanaa 
continued today their desperate offensive attempts to advance in 
the direction of Aden at a time when they continued to shell the 
residential quarters and the vital economic installations, such 
as water and electricity plants for (?no reason). 
  Our brave Armed Forces confronted these [word indistinct] 
desperate offensive attempts which have not inflicted any 
worthwhile losses on our forces, but have caused losses among 
the innocent civilian population -- from among the children, 
women and old men -- as a result of the barbaric, random 
bombardment of the residential quarters. 
  During today's battles, which continue even as we prepare 
this communique, the enemy incurred the following losses: the 
destruction of 12 tanks and three hostile military teams, and 
hundreds of dead and wounded among the enemy's ranks. 
  Our forces' morale is high. God is Great.
