FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Henry Boot marches ahead to Pounds 6.77m
IN SPITE of depressed conditions across its activities, Henry Boot &amp; Sons,
the Sheffield-based construction and property group, reported a satisfactory
performance from all divisions in the 1991 year.
Pre-tax profits showed a 6 per cent advance, from Pounds 6.36m to Pounds
6.77m, and came from turnover down by Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 129.9m.
Mr David Boot, chairman, said that in construction, competition had been
fierce throughout the year, but a reasonable performance had been achieved.
Despite over-capacity and depressed rates, plant hire had also remained
profitable.
Private housing development had seen difficult trading conditions persist
throughout the year. The average selling price of properties had risen to
Pounds 69,500 against Pounds 64,000.
In property development and investment sufficient earnings were generated
through rental income, land sales and mineral exploitation to produce a
satisfactory profit, Mr Boot added.
With cash reserves of Pounds 14.6m the group is well-placed to exploit
opportunities once the recession shows signs of abatement, Mr Boot said.
'There seemed to be a lack of political determination to improve either the
country's overall infrastructure or the climate generally for commercial and
residential developments and this did not augur well for the industry in the
immediate future', he said.
The final dividend is raised to 19.5p making a total of 27p (25p), payable
from earnings per share up from 76.1p to 91.9p.
