  [Text] Twenty-three Filipino crewmen of a Taiwanese trawler 
are now detained in northwestern Somalia. Somali militia forces 
threatened to kill them unless the Philippine Government pays 
ransom amounting to millions of pesos. Reports reaching the 
Foreign Office said the Filipino seamen were intercepted by the 
Somali militia while fishing illegally in northwestern Somalia. 
No names of the Filipinos are immediately available. 
  In his report to the Department of Foreign Affairs, 
Philippine Ambassador to Kenya Edmundo Libid said he sought the 
assistance of the United Nations observers in Mogadishu and the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Nairobi for the 
release of the Filipinos, but this did not push through. The 
Philippines said no members in the UN peacekeeping forces in 
Somalia. [sentence as heard]
