FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Fortis lifted by banking arm
Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group, posted a 9 per cent
increase in second-quarter net profit, with banking profits showing a sharp
rise.
Net profit rose to Ecu154.5m (Dollars 188.5m) from Ecu141.6m a year earlier.
The increase, which followed a 29 per cent rise in the first quarter, takes
first-half results to Ecu264.2m, a 17 per cent improvement on the same
period of 1993.
Fortis, jointly owned by Amev of the Netherlands and AG of Belgium, said
full-year net profit would be 10 per cent to 15 per cent higher than in
1993. This is in spite of plans for unspecified provisions in the second
half for charges to cover internal integration, streamlining and positioning
of the group.
In the first half, pre-tax banking results nearly trebled to Ecu127.1m from
Ecu42.8m a year earlier.
This reflected the first-time consolidation of ASLK-CGER, the Belgian
savings bank group.
Insurance profits rose 13 per cent to Ecu303.4m. Much of the gain was due to
a 32 per cent increase in life insurance results, helped by buoyant results
in the US, the Netherlands and Belgium. The insurance activities of
ASLK-CGER contributed to first-half profits.
Profit from accident and health insurance was virtually unchanged, while
losses in non-life insurance were narrowed to Ecu0.4m from Ecu4.9m.
