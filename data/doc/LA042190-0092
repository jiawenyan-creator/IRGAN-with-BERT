BRIEFLY 
Madison Ave. Meets Hollywood: The William Morris Agency, well known throughout 
Hollywood for linking top stars with top films, has now created a division that 
will also try to link its big-name clients with major advertisers. 
The new entertainment marketing department will be headed by James H. Vail, who 
has helped put together multimillion-dollar sponsorship deals between the 
Rolling Stones and Jovan fragrance, and Willie Nelson and Wrangler jeans. Vail 
will seek corporate sponsorships for everything from concert tours to 
television specials.
