  [Text] Warsaw, 21 Jun--A conversation with President Lech 
Walesa started the first day of an official visit to Poland by 
Mary Robinson, president of Ireland. Lech Walesa, speakers of 
the Sejm and the Senate, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, and 
Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski welcomed Mary Robinson 
outside the Belweder Palace. 
  "Europe and the world are facing new tasks today. Since the 
Iron Curtain has ceased to divide us, we have to find new 
solutions," Lech Walesa said when greeting the Irish president. 
He described the relations between Poland and Ireland as good. 
  Mary Robinson, who is the first Irish president to visit our 
country, said, among other things, that her visit should 
contribute to making the links that already exist between Poland 
and Ireland even closer.
