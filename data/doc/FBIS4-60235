<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
'Ido Baum; place not given; from the weekly "In the Current 
Situation" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Baum] Good morning, Foreign Minister Peres. 
  [Peres] Good morning. 
  [Baum] Let us start with the clean and daring operation by 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. What can you say about it? 
  [Peres] I certainly think the IDF is worthy of all praise 
for this very daring and accurate operation which snatched an 
extremely dangerous individual from the place he used as a 
staging point for a great number of attacks. This proves that 
the IDF is as powerful and effective as ever. In addition, this 
shows that we have not forgotten Ron Arad for one moment, on all 
levels. Israeli officials raise this issue, whether directly or 
indirectly, at almost every diplomatic meeting. This time, the 
IDF's long arm reached out. One must remember that Lebanon is a 
lawless country and there is no other way for us to protect our 
interests to the best of our capabilities. 
  [Baum] The families of the Israeli POW's and MIA's have 
indeed leveled many complaints against the government recently, 
especially for not presenting the issue of the POW's and MIA's 
as a condition in the talks with the PLO. Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres, is kidnapping these leaders really the only 
option? 
  [Peres] It is not the only way, but it is one of them. We 
have also been engaged in diplomatic efforts constantly and on 
an almost daily basis with regard to the issue of the POW's and 
MIA's. We have left no stone unturned in an effort to discover 
some traces or find out what happened to these people. 
  [Baum] What is the next, now that we are holding this 
individual? 
  [Peres] First of all, we want to find out who he turned Ron 
Arad over to. It is clear that he held Ron Arad prisoner for a 
reasonably long period. Our problem is to get an address. Who 
is holding Ron Arad and where? This operation was one of the 
milestones on the way to that address. 
  [Baum] After the assassination of 'Abbas al-Musawi [former 
Hizballah leader], katyushas were fired at Israel's northern 
settlements? Should these settlements prepare for such an 
attack now? 
  [Peres] I hope not. 
  [Baum] Thank you, Foreign Minister Peres.
