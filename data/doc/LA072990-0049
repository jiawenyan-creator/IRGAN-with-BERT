POP EYE 
FREE SPEECH I: Virgin Records' Jeff Ayeroff, one of the few record execs brave 
enough to take a stand against censorship and record labeling, has already made 
news by saying he'll put pro-First Amendment stickers on new Virgin discs 
starting next week. But now Virgin is battling censorship with the best weapon 
possible -- satire. Friday, the label will release "(If U Want Free Speech) Go 
to Russia," a mock-rap single by political spoofster Harry Shearer that 
features a biting attack on anti-rock crusaders. 
(The single will have cover art designed by "Simpsons" creator Matt Groening.) 
It goes in part: 
 This is the Sheriff of Yahoo County talkin', 
 If you're sellin' smutty rap, you better start walkin', 
 No use suin', no use squawkin', the judge sez I can come in and hush ya, 
 If U want free speech, go to Russia. . . . 
 From museums to movies to record stores, we're drying up America's sores, 
 A mind is a terrible thing to have without doors, 
 So don't make me come in and cuff and cuss ya, 
 If U want free speech, go to Russia.
