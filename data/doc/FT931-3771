FT  13 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow drops after heavy selling
in bonds
Wall Street
US share prices fell sharply yesterday after an unexpectedly strong February
producer prices index sparked heavy selling in the bond market amid fears of
a revival in inflation, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 29.18 at 3,427.82,
above its lows for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
finished 3.92 lower at 449.80, while the Amex composite ended down 1.22 at
421.09, and the Nasdaq composite 1.50 lower at 692.78. Volume on the NYSE
was 247m shares, and declines outnumbered rises by 1,376 to 545.
The news that prompted the selling yesterday was the 0.4 per cent rise in
the February PPI and although the increase was only slightly higher than
forecast, equity investors reacted badly to the figures - partly because of
the sell-off in the bond market that they triggered. In late trading the
benchmark 30-year bond was down almost 1 1/2 points at 103 7/32 , pushing
the yield up to 6.867 per cent.
Investors were also selling because of a lack of confidence in the market's
recent rally, which only on Wednesday lifted the Dow to a record high.
Stocks look expensive in relation to corporate earnings, and recent
statistics have cast some doubt on the outlook for the economy.
Analysts also said that concern about the political situation in Russia may
have contributed to declines.
Primerica rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 49 1/2 and American Express added
Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 28 after the two groups concluded a Dollars 1bn deal
in which the latter's Shearson broking subsidiary will be merged into
Primerica's Smith Barney brokerage unit.
Under the terms of the deal, American Express will get Dollars 850m in cash,
Dollars 125m in convertible preferred stock and Dollars 25m in warrants from
Primerica. American Express said it would take a first quarter charge of
about Dollars 630m, which would include taxes, transaction-related costs and
a reduction in goodwill of Dollars 750m.
General Motors eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 38 3/8 in volume of 2m shares
as investors shrugged off the unexpected departure of Mr J Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortura, the head of worldwide purchasing at the carmaker and a key
figure in the company's cost-cutting campaign.
Cyclical stocks were hit by selling, primarily because they had enjoyed big
gains earlier in the week when optimism about the economy was sweeping
stocks to new highs. Caterpillar lost Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 57 3/4 ,
International Paper slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 64, General Electric
tumbled Dollars 1 to Dollars 86 1/2 , Goodyear dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 74 1/2 , and Alcoa fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 69 1/2 .
