FT  28 OCT 93 / Greece recalls envoy from Tirana
Greece has recalled its ambassador to Tirana following violent clashes last
week in a southern Albanian village, where an elderly woman from the ethnic
Greek minority reportedly died of injuries resulting from a beating by
Albanian police, writes Kerin Hope from Athens. The Albanian government
rejected a Greek protest over last week's clashes in Krania, near Sarande,
saying Mrs Athanasia Stamatos died of natural causes.
The villagers claim the clashes broke out because Albanian refugees from
Kosovo were being allowed to take over land belonging to the ethnic Greek
minority.
