FT  20 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Bolivia in deal to supply Brazil with
natural gas from 1995
BOLIVIA is to supply Brazil with natural gas from the start of 1995, under a
preliminary agreement signed by President Fernando Collor of Brazil and
President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia, Christopher Philipsborn reports from
La Paz.
The gas will run through a proposed pipeline from Santa Cruz Department in
eastern Bolivia to Campinas, in Sao Paulo state, 2,000km away. The World
Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and Eximbank of Japan are said to
be considering loans for part of the pipeline's Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 730m)
cost, with the rest to come from the private sector.
At first, 8m cubic metres of gas a day are planned to reach Brazil, rising
to 16m cu m. Prices will vary with that of fuel oil, at first based on
Dollars 0.90 per 1,000 cu ft at the wellhead, and Dollars 1.22 at the
border.
The deal may help Brazil shift from dependence on poor-quality oil for
making electricity. Most of the Bolivian gas will power part of the
industrial and domestic demand for electricity in Sao Paulo.
Those worried about pollution from burning oil with high sulphur content to
make electricity favour the gas alternative. Gas use by Sao Paulo industry
is set to reach 35m cu m by the year 2000, possibly heralding a gas deal
between Brazil and Argentina, which has an estimated 60bn cu mts of natural
gas in its Salta reserves. For Bolivia, the deal could not come quickly
enough. It was hard hit by the fall this year in the price of its gas sales
to Argentina.
