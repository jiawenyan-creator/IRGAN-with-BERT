FT  03 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German chemicals sector
boosted by upgrade
Overnight gains on Wall Street gave bourses a good start yesterday, although
there was also talk of their domestic attractions, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT, after a recovery based on better bond markets, a stronger dollar
and the outlook for the German economy, put in an extra spurt after DB
Research, the Deutsche Bank research arm, put out sharply upgraded earnings
estimates for the big three German chemical companies.
The Dax index rose 32.60 to 2,186.39 and continued to improve after hours,
ending 1.5 per cent higher on the day at an Ibis-indicated 2,193.63.
Ms Petra Zamagna, for DB Research, lifted BASF's 1994 and 1995 earnings
estimates from DM14.50, and DM23, to DM21 and DM30; Hoechst's from DM16 and
DM27 to DM25 and DM31; and Bayer's from DM25.50 and DM30 to DM26 and
DM32.50. She noted that the accent was on the two more cyclical stocks, BASF
and Hoechst, rather than on Bayer, with its strong position in
pharmaceuticals.
BASF rose DM8.70 to DM329.20, Bayer DM9.30 to DM372.80 and Hoechst DM12.80
to DM358.50. Ms Zamagna said that the reason for the ugrades was that
business was much better than expected.
The third quarter, she said, normally produced a downturn in order intake
and an absence of product price increases but this year there was evidence,
backed up by recent progress reports from ICI, in the UK, and Solvay, in
Belgium, that the order intake had continued to grow in July and that
product price rises were continuing to take place.
In the broad market, turnover soared from DM4.7bn to DM8.5bn. Financials
were relatively weak after Monday's stagnant first-half operating profits at
Bayernhypo, but Daimler rose with renewed vigour, by DM16.20 to DM816.20. In
engineering and metals, Preussag and Thyssen added DM12.30 at DM466 and DM9
at DM305.50 on the assumption that their products will feed the recovery in
the German economy as a whole.
PARIS was another beneficiary of the livelier atmosphere across the
Continent and was also supported by higher turnover, up to FFr4.6bn from
Monday's low FFr2bn. The CAC-40 index advanced 47.65, or 2.3 per cent, to
2,117.23.
UBS Global Research highlighted the fall in French unemployment in June  -
the first monthly decrease since 1990. 'More jobs means more positive income
prospects and higher consumption, underpinning our robust consumption
forecast of 2.4 per cent growth in 1994,' the research team commented.
'Also, as unemployment falls, it becomes less of an issue in the
presidential election, diminishing the prospects of some radical departure
from present policy. This will have the effect of settling the bond market
and, through this channel, supporting the equity market.'
Peugeot moved FFr11 ahead to FFr870 on a rise in domestic new car sales in
July.
ZURICH, returning from a long weekend break, rose 2 per cent as it caught up
with Wall Street. The SMI index added 50.2 at 2,629.7, but trading was quiet
and volume low.
Banks were firm, CS Holding bearers rising SFr11 to SFr582, with last
Friday's figures from Credit Suisse, which contained no unpleasant
surprises, providing cautious encouragement. UBS moved up SFr12 to SFr1,196
ahead of its six-month figures due later in the week.
Roche certificates continued their recovery from recent lows, bouncing
SFr170 to SFr5,490. Ciba registered were marked SFr28 higher to SFr809.
AMSTERDAM made further headway and the AEX index finished at its highest
level since mid-April, rising 7.1, or 1.7 per cent, to 419.24 in
anticipation of the interim report season.
Akzo Nobel and DSM, featuring second-quarter results today, made respective
gains of Fl 2.80 and Fl 3.10 to Fl 219.50 and Fl 147.40. Analysts were
expecting both chemical groups to confirm signs of Europe-wide recovery,
while DSM is seen as providing the stronger results.
ABN-Amro gained further ground, following on from Monday's rise when it
broke through the Fl 60 resistance level, to end up Fl 2.20 at Fl 62.30.
Unilever was another of the day's big risers, climbing Fl 5.50 to Fl 195.90.
MILAN hoped that Mr Silvio Berlusconi's address to parliament last night
would help to clear the air. The Comit index rose 6.63 to 715.33.
Industrials led the advance, as hopes grew for positive first-half results.
Fiat added L82 at L7,041 and Olivetti put on L34 at L2,433. Pirelli firmed
L34 to L2,940 after announcing that it was selling its 50 per cent stake in
Caboto Sim for L72bn to Ambroveneto.
Stet put on L140 at L5,384 after Monday's growth forecasts forgroup income
and operating profits this year. Sip rose L106 to L4,608.
MADRID majored on its US quoted stocks and turnover nearly doubled on the
day, jumping from Pta26.1bn to Pta50.65bn as strong buying was seen in
Telefonica, Repsol and Endesa.
Unfortunately, the US stimulus weakened in the late afternoon and the
general index closed off its best, 1.42 higher at 320.80. Telefonica and
Repsol finished modestly better, up by Pta10 at Pta1,880 and Pta30 at
Pta4,275, while Endesa eventually fell Pta30 to Pta6,230.
