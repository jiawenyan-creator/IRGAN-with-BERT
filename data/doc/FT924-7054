FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: Solid sales growth at Nintendo
NINTENDO, the Japanese video game manufacturer, saw solid growth in both
interim sales and profits, driven by firm demand for its new video game
software.
The company, which is likely to become the third-largest profit earner among
listed Japanese manufacturers, posted a 5.5 per cent rise in
non-consolidated pre-tax profits to Y80.25bn (Dollars 647.17m) for the first
half to September, and a 13.2 per cent rise in sales to Y277.4bn. After-tax
profits totalled Y41.5bn, up 10.4 per cent.
Despite a fall in domestic consumer spending and a continued slump in
overseas economies, the company saw strong demand for the advanced version
of its video game. Domestic sales jumped by 15.4 per cent to Y101.7bn while
exports increased 11.9 per cent to Y175.6bn.
Nintendo said its video game, Super NES, had gained particular popularity in
Europe, where the company started to market the model this year.
New software using the popular game character, Mario, also contributed to
the rise in sales.
Nintendo said its most popular software product had sold 2.27m copies since
its launch at the end of September.
The company saw a 5 per cent rise in interest received, thanks to a 25.1 per
cent rise in cash in hand and deposits.
The company is renowned for not having short or long-term borrowings, or
speculative securities investments.
For the full year to March, parent pre-tax profits are expected to rise 6.4
per cent to Y166.2bn, surpassing non-consolidated pre-tax profits at
Matsushita Electric Industrial.
Sales are forecast to rise 10.3 per cent to Y560bn, while after-tax profits
are projected to increase just under 1 per cent to Y86bn.
