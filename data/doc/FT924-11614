FT  24 OCT 92 / Only small Protestant majority in Ulster
THE POPULATION balance between Roman Catholics and Protestants in Northern
Ireland is far closer than popularly believed, according to census figures
published yesterday.
The general perception had been of a two-to-one split in favour of the
Protestants among the 1.5m population - but the census, taken in April 1991,
shows a difference of only 4.4 per cent.
A total of 38.4 per cent recorded themselves as Roman Catholic and 42.8 per
cent said they belonged to the Protestant church - 21.3 per cent
Presbyterian, 17.7 per cent Church of Ireland and 3.8 per cent Methodist.
Other religious groupings, including the Jewish, Chinese and Indian
communities, represent 7.8 per cent of the total population.
A further 3.8 per cent recorded themselves as having no religion and 7.3 per
cent did not respond to the voluntary question on the census form.
The findings are thought to provide the most accurate snapshot of life in
Northern Ireland for 20 years.
The 1981 census was distorted because many Roman Catholics did not fill in
forms at a time of tension during the IRA Maze prison hunger strike.
The census shows there are now more pensioners.
