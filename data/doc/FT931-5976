FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Yukong ahead as domestic oil
demand rises
YUKONG, South Korea's largest oil refining and petrochemical group, has
reported a 19.5 per cent rise in net profits to Won29.3bn (Dollars 37m) for
1992 on sales 17.4 per cent ahead at Won4,721bn.
The sales increase reflected the country's rapid growth in oil consumption.
Earnings improved due to the favourable revision of government-set foreign
exchange rates and base prices applied to crude oil imports.
Yukong also benefited from lower interest rates. The company has heavy
financial expenses following the construction of eight new petrochemical
plants in 1991.
Ssangyong Oil Refining reported net earnings up 114 per cent to Won87.3bn,
while sales rose by 12.4 per cent to Won2,043bn.
The rise in earnings reflected the same financial factors in Yukong's profit
increase.
