METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT IN MCDONALD'S STANDOFF ORDERED TO 
TRIAL 
A man who police mistakenly thought was holding hostages at a McDonald's in La 
Verne was ordered to stand trial Tuesday on robbery charges stemming from a 
holdup at a clothing store near the fast-food restaurant. 
After a preliminary hearing, Pomona Municipal Court Judge Tom Peterson ruled 
there was sufficient evidence to prosecute Douglas E. Girard, 32, of San 
Jacinto, on three felony counts. 
Girard's arraignment was set for Oct. 23 in Pomona. 
Girard was arrested Sept. 24 after a seven-hour standoff in which police and 
sheriff's SWAT teams surrounded the restaurant in the belief that Girard was 
holding 20 people hostage. But after talking with the McDonald's customers, 
prosecutors decided that Girard never brandished his gun nor made any threats 
and was only trying to blend in with the customers to avoid detection by 
police. 
Police said they linked Girard to a $200 holdup at a Kids Mart store across the 
street from the McDonald's and an earlier $50 robbery at a Claremont florist 
shop.
