FT  09 NOV 94 / Secret deal claims denied
Mr Brian Loton, Broken Hill Proprietary chairman, and Sir James Balderstone,
former chairman, yesterday denied claims they knew of an alleged 'secret
arrangement' between Elders IXL, the group formerly controlled by Mr John
Elliott, and companies associated with Mr Allan Hawkins, the now jailed New
Zealand businessman, relating to purchase of BHP shares. The alleged
agreement is at the centre of a Melbourne committal hearing following filing
of theft and conspiracy charges against Mr Elliott and other Elders IXL
executives last year. Elders is alleged to have used sham foreign exchange
transactions to cover transfer of ADollars 66.5m (Pounds 30.2m) to Mr
Hawkins, a payment supposedly related to purchase of BHP shares by him in
the late 1980s.
