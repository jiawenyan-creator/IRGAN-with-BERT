  [Text] Ants Laaneots, chief of main staff of the Estonian 
Defense Forces, has announced that in the future the Estonian 
army will be armed mainly with Israeli weapons meeting NATO 
standards and the Kaitseliit volunteer military organization 
will be armed with Soviet-produced weapons. In the army units 
the firearms caliber will mainly be 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm. The 
7.62 mm machineguns bought in Israel will be installed on 
armored personnel carriers, the 23 mm automatic antiaircraft 
guns will be used by the air defense forces. Laaneots said that 
these guns are the only type of Estonian Army weapon which does 
not meet NATO standards: The NATO countries use 20 mm automatic 
guns. 
  Kaitseliit will be armed with 7.62 Kalashnikov assault 
rifles 
and Israeli machineguns of the same caliber. In addition 
Kaitseliit will be provided with grenade throwers. 
  The police will switch to Israeli 9 mm "Mini-Uzi" pistols 
and 
the internal defense operational battalion will receive 5.45 mm 
Kalashnikov assault rifles. The Estonian border guards will 
also be equipped in part with Israeli weapons. 
  "This distribution of weapons is temporary," Ants Laaneots, 
chief of main staff of the Estonian Defense Forces, believes. 
"It is essential to set up the supply of power structures with 
spare parts and ammunition of NATO-model weapons."
