CALIFORNIA'S WATER SUPPLY 
I want to compliment you on your editorial of June 26. 
For many years I have been on the Metropolitan Water District Board, 
representing the San Gabriel Valley, and from 1975 to 1979 I was chairman of 
the board during the last serious drought. During and since water leaders have 
worked hard and long to pass the Peripheral Canal Bill or similar legislation 
to get more water to Southern California. 
Nine years later the problem is still not solved. 
Three things must happen to solve the persistent water problem for California. 
Water must be transported to where the growth is happening; agriculture must be 
sustained as it is the biggest industry in California; and our precious 
environment must be preserved for future generations. 
All three can be done by sincere people working together.
