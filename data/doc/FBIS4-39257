Mao's Method"] 
  [Text] In Maritime Kray the militia, chekists, and border 
guards have carried out a very large "purge" among foreigners. 
As we know, the guests from adjacent states have for a long 
time now been held in no great respect in the Far East. The 
authorities and special services intended at least to recount 
them. The effect was striking: Over the course of a week 
nearly 2,000 foreign citizens were discovered living illegally 
on the kray's territory. They are mainly Chinese who crossed the 
Russian border as tourists and then settled in oru country. 
  Some were fined for a lapsed visa, some had criminal 
proceedings brought against them for possessing false passports, 
and 944 PRC citizens were immediately deported to their 
historical homeland. (Incidentally, there has not been a single 
protest from the Chinese authorities). 
  The operation is not ended. It has become known that many of 
our "guests" have settled deep in the taiga settlements, since 
the wild fruit harvesting season is approaching. Militia 
detachments have been sent there. Some people will be very 
unlucky on the narrow path of war in the Ussuri taiga....
