 

C. 

Energy savings. 

As indicated above, all standard levels, 
except level 5, will result in significant savings of energy consumption for 
direct heating equipment. 

 D. 

Lessening of utility or performance of products. 

As indicated 
above, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that the 
standards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performance of 
direct heating equipment. 

 E. 

Impact of lessening of competition. 

The determination of this 
factor must be made by the Attorney General. 

 F. 

Need of the nation to save energy. 

In 1987, 6.1 percent of 
residential sector natural gas consumption (or 0.32 quad) was accounted for on 
a national basis by direct heating equipment. 

 In addition, decreasing energy use as a result of standards will usually 
decrease air pollution. However, in the case of direct heating equipment, 
projected fuel switching from gas to electric resistance heat causes the 
energy savings to be less than it otherwise would be, and at some of the trial 
standard levels the impact on the environment is negative, since it takes more 
primary energy to heat with resistance electric heat than with a gas furnace.

. Evaluating 
standards for electric direct heating equipment might result in standards 
requiring the use of heat pump technology which would probably resolve this 
abnormality, but DOE has not considered adding standards for electric direct 
heating equipment in this proposed rule. The resulting impact on energy use 
because of fuel switching was considered in The Department's decision-making 
as discussed in the conclusion below.

Decreases in air pollution will occur for sulfur oxides (listed in 
equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or SO

2

) at level 1. For all classes of 
direct heating equipment at standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the 
total estimated SO

2

 reduction would be over 5,000 tons. During this time 
period, the peak annual reduction of SO

2

 emissions that are expected to be 
emitted by power plants in the United States is close to 0 percent. For 
standard levels 2 and 3, the reductions are 20,000 tons and 32,000 tons, 
respectively. For standard levels 4 and 5, SO

2

 emissions are projected to 
increase by 72,000 tons and 320,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak 
annual increase of these levels is 0.18 percent. 
 
Standards at level 1 would result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide 
(NO

2

) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total 
estimated NO

2

 reduction would be over 4,000 tons. During this time period, 
the peak annual reduction of NO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by 
power plants during that time in the United States is 0.01 percent. For 
standard levels 2 and 3, the reductions are 21,000 tons and 37,000 tons, 
respectively. For standard levels 4 and 5, NO

2

 emissions are projected to 
increase by 27,000 tons and 184,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak 
annual increase of these levels is 0.13 percent. 
 
Another consequence of the standards will be changes in (CO

2

) emissions. 
For standard levels 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO

2

 
reductions would be 2 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual 
reduction of CO

2

 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in 
the United States is 0.01 percent. For standard levels 24 the reductions are 
14 million tons, 26 million tons, and 2 million tons, respectively. The 
highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.03 percent. For standard 
level 5, CO

2

 emissions are expected to increase by 60 million tons with a 
highest peak annual increase of 0.10 percent. 
 
Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in 
reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because 
virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in 
oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. For 
standard level 1, the estimated decrease in oil imports is 1.1 million barrels 
over the years 1996 to 2030. For standard levels 2, the reductions in oil 
imports are estimated to be 3.5 and 6 million barrels, respectively; while for 
standard levels 4 and 5 are estimated to result in an increase in oil imports 
of 15.43 and 70.03 million barrels, respectively.
