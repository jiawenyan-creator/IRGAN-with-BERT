FT  02 JUN 92 / Minister challenges private sector
GOVERNMENT plans to put Civil Service functions out to competitive tender
offer the private sector enormous opportunities to market services, Mr
William Waldegrave, minister of public service and science, said yesterday.
Private concerns would have to improve their quality of service, though, if
people became accustomed to a higher quality of service in the public
sector.
Mr Waldegrave said: 'There are an increasing number of public-sector
organisations providing services that could put some private sector
organisations in the shade.'
Speaking at a conference in London organised by The Sunday Times, he
reaffirmed the government's commitment to improving public services.
Competitive tendering had improved the quality and cost-effectiveness of
many local government services, he said. Now up to one in four Civil Service
jobs might be put out to tender.
Breaking away from nationally determined pay scales was another essential
step in improving public services.
Mr Waldegrave said he wanted to break down the barriers between the public
and private sectors. There should be 'parity of esteem' between them, based
on rival and complementary excellences.
