  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa expressed hopes Friday for the resumption of framework 
trade talks between Japan and the United States. 
  Speaking to reporters after Thursday's bilateral trade talks 
in Washington, Kakizawa said, "I hear the talks began in a 
friendly atmosphere. The U.S. negotiators are apparently going 
to consider the Japanese proposals and it seems they will also 
be taking a constructive attitude." 
  Tokyo has dispatched two senior officials -- Sozaburo 
Okamatsu, vice trade minister for international affairs, and 
Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs 
-- to the closed-door meeting. 
  In comments made after Friday's cabinet meeting, Kakizawa 
said he has learned that the bilateral meeting is expected to 
continue Friday. Asked whether he would visit the U.S., Kakizawa 
said he would like to make a decision after receiving more 
reports on the talks.
