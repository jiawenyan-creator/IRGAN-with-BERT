FT  24 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Inclemency corks future for HWC
Hail and blight can now be added to over-expansion, crippling debt and
management incompetence on the list of main causes behind the collapse of UK
companies.
The Hungerford Wine Company has entered voluntary liquidation, in large part
because the harvests of 1991 and 1992 were rendered disastrous by
heaven-sent afflictions, according to Mrs Shirley Jackson, provisional
liquidator from Begbie Norton, the insolvency practitioner.
She said that HWC's cashflow had been hit by the lack of product to sell,
and this was in spite of no lack of customers in the fine wine market.
HWC specialised in the top sector of the fine wine market and especially in
the Bordeaux en primeur trade, selling to private consumers and collectors.
It has wine laid down in bonded warehouses for more than 1,500 customers.
Mr Nick Davies, owner and managing director, had explored all potential
routes to reconstruction, she said, but none had borne fruit. His main
concern now was to ensure that clients could take delivery of their wines,
perhaps on payment of a levy for storage and transportation.
Mrs Jackson herself is allergic to wine.
