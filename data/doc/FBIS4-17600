  [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- Eleven Russian observers who 
served at U.N. mission's civil police in former Yugoslavia, 
returned to Moscow on Monday. They monitored movements of 
humanitarian cargoes, exchange of refugees and observance of 
human rights in that region in the framework of U.N. 
peace-keeping activities. 
  "Such practice exists at all the U.N. missions in various 
countries when civil police work along with military observers," 
Aleksandra Zemskova, representative of the Interior Ministry 
personnel department, told journalists later in the day. 
  Belgrade, Zagreb, Sarajevo and Tuzla are some of the places 
where Russian observers work. Their first group was dispatched 
to the Balkans in the spring of 1992. Russian Interior Ministry 
staff members have been regularly relieving one another since 
that time.
