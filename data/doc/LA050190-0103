Recommended: 
"FOUNTAIN"(U.S.S.R.; Director: Yuri Mamin. Cineplex Odeon Fairfax, 9:15 p.m.). 
Wildly satiric, no-holds-barred, post-perestroika comedy: a Kazakstanian 
peasant grandfather, put in charge of a Moscow apartment house water pipe room, 
pulls the whole house into chaos -- with a little help from bureaucracy, 
inefficiency and social malaise. All are amply ridiculed. (Michael Wilmington) 
"AMERICAN STORIES"(U.S.; D: Chantal Akerman. Cineplex Century Plaza 2, 9:15 
p.m.) Bizarre Jewish-American vaudeville from the Belgian art film director of 
"Toute Une Nuite" -- which, formally, this film resembles. A series of 
sketches, mostly taken from old ethnic jokes, are done black-out style against 
outdoor New York City backgrounds. Strange, sometimes stiff, intermittently 
touching. (Michael Wilmington) 
"CIRCUS BOYS"(Japan; D: Kaizo Hayashi. Century Plaza 2, 7 p.m.) Beautiful 
black-and-white images, charmingly archaic, adorn this archetypal fable of two 
boys, good and bad, whose paths cross and diverge in the circus. (Michael 
Wilmington)
