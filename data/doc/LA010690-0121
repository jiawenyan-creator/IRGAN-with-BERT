Bill LaForge, new director of operations for the Tri-City Americans of the 
Western Hockey League, has been reassigned by team owner Ron Dixon so he won't 
come in contact with the players, who staged a one-game boycott a week ago in 
protest of LaForge's forceful style. LaForge had been hired by the Kennewick 
(Wash.) team Dec. 17. 
Dixon said he was putting LaForge in charge of scouting and the players agreed 
not to boycott any more games.
