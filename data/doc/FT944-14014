FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Russian acquisition for Bula
Bula Resources (Holdings), the Dublin-based oil exploration and production
company, is proceeding with its acquisition of an option to purchase a 51
per cent interest in Aki-Otyr, a Russian oil joint stock company, from the
Russian Corporation, as announced in May.
Bula has undertaken over the past few months an extensive due diligence on
Aki-Otyr. The directors said it was the first time a fully listed company
had acquired for paper a controlling interest in a Russian joint stock
company in the oil sector.
Bula proposes initially to acquire an option over the 51 per cent interest
in Aki-Otyr and at the same time to enter into a management agreement to
establish western financial controls. It said it would exercise the option
once the controls were operating satisfactorily.
The consideration for the option is Dollars 5.57m (Pounds 3.5m) and the
issue of fully paid new ordinary shares representing 8 per cent of Bula's
enlarged share capital.
Bula believes a minimum IPounds 6m (Pounds 5.9m) will be required to fund
the acquisition and provide working capital. Accordingly a placing of not
less than IPounds 2m and an offer to shareholders to raise about IPounds 12m
is being made.
Following exercise of the option, the Russian Corporation will control 26
per cent of Bula's enlarged capital.
It is proposed that Mr Alexander Marichev and Ms Tatyana Kirillova,
president and finance director respectively of the Russian Corporation, and
Mr Vladimir Krasilya, president of Aki-Otyr, will join Bula's board.
Bula also announced reduced losses of IPounds 1.95m (IPounds 2.57m), after
tax of IPounds 3,000 (IPounds 2,000), for 1993. The result includes an
exceptional loss of IPounds 1.34m on disposal of its UK operations,
including IPounds 1.19m goodwill previously written off.
Turnover was IPounds 1.29m (IPounds 1.58m) including IPounds 99,000 (IPounds
438,000) from discontinued operations.
Losses per share were cut to 0.29p (0.48p).
Bula's shares resumed trading yesterday at 3 1/2 p.
