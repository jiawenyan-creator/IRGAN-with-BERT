LOS ANGELES ETHICS BILL 
Why do City Council members meander the council chambers and constantly talk 
during public meetings? That was the question I asked myself when I took the 
time from work to attend the council's "ethics" hearings. I knew why I was 
there. 
I wanted to participate in democracy, show my support for reform and listen to 
and observe democracy at work. However, it was quite clear that public hearings 
don't involve much listening at all. 
Prestigious citizens gave earnest testimony about the importance of reform in 
city government. Meanwhile, council members snacked on crackers, joked with the 
bailiffs and conversed with staff. It is understandable that council members 
have matters to attend to during these hearings which require some 
communication with their staff, etc. 
However, the lack of common courtesy by council members to persons giving 
testimony and the obvious lack of real interest in hearing what they had to say 
was inexcusable. 
Ethics in government is only one piece of the puzzle. Democratic government 
requires that citizens have the opportunity to meaningfully participate in 
local government and receive the respect that they, as citizens, deserve. And 
unless citizens such as myself can feel wanted and listened to by their elected 
officials both inside and outside the public forum, then the process is one big 
joke, albeit a sad one.
