  [Text] We have just received a report from Tbilisi, 
clarifying an earlier item from there, which said that Eduard 
Shevardnadze had resigned. 
  Well, he has not resigned, the RIA agency reports. He has 
proposed a switch to a different form of government. An agency 
correspondent was told by someone in Shevardnadze's entourage 
that an address by the head of the Georgian state at a closed 
sitting of parliament had been misunderstood.
