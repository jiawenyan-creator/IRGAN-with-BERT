FT  04 FEB 94 / Sharp decline in Venezuelan currency reserves
Venezuela's international monetary reserves fell sharply last month after a
rush into US dollars prompted by the failure of the country's second largest
bank, Banco Latino, and as a result of lower receipts from oil exports.
The central bank said international reserves dropped by Dollars 744m (Pounds
496m) in January, or 5.8 per cent, to Dollars 11.9bn at the end of the month
 -after falling by only Dollars 513m during the whole of last year. Reserves
are still sufficient to cover the 1993 import bill.
Mr Julio Sosa Rodriguez, the finance minister, said that the new government,
which took office on Wednesday, wanted to refinance around '15-20 per cent'
of the principal payments on its non-restructured public sector external
debt maturing this year. This would not affect any Venezuelan bond issues.
The central bank also said the cost of living index rose by 4.3 per cent in
January, a bad start for the year. The rise, compared with 3 per cent in
January 1993, resulted from the application of a new value added tax to
retail sales. Inflation last year was 46 per cent.
Ministers said on Wednesday that the government of President Rafael Caldera
would try to negotiate price agreements with producers in order to control
inflation and avoid shortages, and that a price increase for petrol
(contemplated in the 1994 budget) would not be approved 'over the short
term'.
