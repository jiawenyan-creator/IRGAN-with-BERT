FT  03 NOV 92 / Lenders shun home rentals
PLANS BY a building society to rent out repossessed properties on a large
scale are not expected to be followed by its rivals.
Bradford &amp; Bingley, the seventh-biggest building society in the UK, is to
put 400 of its 2,000 repossessed properties up for rent over the next 12
months. The scheme will provide income from homes that cannot be sold in the
depressed housing market to help maintain the properties.
Bradford &amp; Bingley said that homes left unoccupied quickly fall into
disrepair. But the scheme, which has been approved by the Building
Societies' Commission, does not appear to be attracting the interest of
other lenders.
Britain's two biggest building societies, Halifax and Nationwide, already
rent out repossessed properties but only in special circumstances.
Halifax prefers to sell repossessed properties to Housing Associations for
them to rent, rather than take on rentals itself, it said.
'Our main concern is keeping people in the properties to begin with,' the
building society added.
Nationwide rents out repossessed homes on a case-by-case basis as part of a
'range of ideas' to help the housing market.
Nationwide said: 'We have a duty to do what's best for the borrower. The
longer a property remains on the market, the bigger the interest payments
accrued.'
Mortgage lenders have 68,000 repossessed properties on their books and find
it difficult to find buyers while the market remains so weak.
However, the government's decision to make state payments of mortgage
interest for the unemployed direct to lenders, and a big increase in
counselling services and mortgage debt rescheduling, is cutting the number
of repossessions.
Other lenders have taken different initiatives. The moves include plans by
National &amp; Provincial and Bristol &amp; West societies to rent 200 repossessed
properties to the homeless at social rents, through a subsidiary company.
