FT  07 APR 92 / Link with private sector welcomed
LOCAL AUTHORITIES have come to see over the past decade that partnership
with the private sector is fundamental to the wellbeing of their areas, Mr
Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of
Metropolitan Authorities, said yesterday.
To fulfil their responsibilities to their areas, councils cannot be
indifferent to the needs of business, and business cannot thrive against a
background of decline and decay, Mr Beecham told members of the Tyne and
Wear Chamber of Commerce, Trade and Industry.
Through organisations such as Business in the Community, private-sector
leaders have become much more aware, he said, of the pressures on local
authorities and the constraints they face. Local authorities, he added,
needed perhaps to appreciate more the pressures on businesses and not always
to expect them to fill in 'gaps in the system'.
