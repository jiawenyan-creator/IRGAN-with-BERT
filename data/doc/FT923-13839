Jones
DOW JONES, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, yesterday reported a 25.2
per cent rise in second-quarter net income as the recovery in advertising
demand continued.
Dow Jones reported net income of Dollars 43.5m, or 43 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 34.7m, or 34 cents, in the second quarter of last
year.
Revenues rose 5.6 per cent to Dollars 467.5m. Operating earnings were 25.4
per cent higher at Dollars 89.3m. For the first six months of 1992,
operating income was up 30.6 per cent at Dollars 154.2m.
The company said the increase in net income for the three months ended June
30 was due chiefly to higher advertising lineage at The Wall Street Journal.
Compared with the same period of 1991, lineage increased by 6.4 per cent in
the second quarter and by 7.7 per cent in the first six months of 1992.
Earnings were also helped by lower interest expenses and by improved
performances at both Telerate, the electronic financial information service,
and at the Ottaway community newspaper subsidiary.
Operating income at the business publication division, which includes The
Journal, was 36.9 per cent higher at Dollars 44.7m in the second quarter.
Revenues in the division increased by 6.7 per cent to Dollars 209.9m.
