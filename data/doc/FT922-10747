FT  29 APR 92 / Observer: Means business
Who is going to be South Africa's next finance minister? More important,
does it matter in the short-term?
The task of piloting the economy of the old South Africa broke Barend du
Plessis  - whose resignation came amid rumours of a nervous breakdown. Over
the past eight years he did a creditable job running an economy under siege
while also presiding over a gradual liberalisation of the country's economic
policies.
His fall from grace over the last couple of years has been dramatic,
however, and his resignation was a recognition of the fact that there was no
place for him in the new South Africa. His relations with the ANC and its
trade union ally Cosatu were far too acrimonious for there to have been any
chance of his being part of a consensus-based government.
Dawie de Villiers, the ex-springbok scrum-half, is probably the only
politician up to the job. But big business would much prefer an apolitical
figure like Derek Keys, the ex-Gencor boss recently appointed Minister of
Trade and Industry and Economic Co-ordination. He also has the big advantage
of being an English speaker.
But combining finance with his current portfolio would probably be too big a
strain even for someone of Key's calibre. If he stays put, Standard Bank
chairman Conrad Strauss, and Harry Schwartz, the ambassador to Washington,
are possibilities.
Given the desperate state of the South African economy, President de Klerk
needs to find a new finance minister who will survive the arrival of an
interim government. Schwartz would fit the bill, although at 68, he is not
young. The cerebral Strauss is highly regarded in banking circles, but
whether the ANC would tolerate for long two unelected businessmen holding
the main economic levers is moot.
