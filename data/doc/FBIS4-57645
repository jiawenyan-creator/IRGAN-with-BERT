  [Text] A bomb exploded this evening in Medellin as a police 
patrol car passed by, coming from the stadium. Preliminary 
information received by AM/PM newscast indicates six agents were 
riding in the patrol car destroyed by the explosion. One officer 
and three policemen died, and two were critically injured. The 
patrol car was part of a police caravan in charge of the 
security for a soccer match in Colombia. This street was the 
only route the caravan could take to reach their command post. 
The policemen spent the whole game facing the crowd to guarantee 
the players' safety.
