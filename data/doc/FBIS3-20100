  [Text] The royal reception that France gave the German 
foreign minister in Paris was not intended to counter the worry 
that is seizing our neighbors when they think of Germany. 
Kinkel's handshake with Juppe, Balladur, and Mitterrand had 
been planned for a long time. However, the criticism of the 
French ambassador, who indicated that Paris did not know how to 
treat the new Germany, and that the new Germany was striking a 
false note, has presented the situation in bright light. 
  The crisis has been averted, but distrust remains. It cannot 
be dispelled even by the most excellent speech. France's 
foreign-policy oligarchy is asking itself what secret plans 
Germany has for Europe. With the European Union [EU], Paris 
wants to protect French interests and tie Bonn firmly to the 
central countries of the West. When Kohl and Kinkel are now -- 
in the Elysee's view -- obsessed with pushing EU enlargement 
toward the north and East, this would hit French foreign policy 
in a weak spot. Is even this chancellor -- who is actually a 
European -- intending to free himself from the chains that 
Germany has put on itself, free himself from the firm links to 
the West -- this is the question French diplomats are asking, 
sometimes in a low voice, sometimes very loudly. 
  A flat no is not an answer. It takes time for a new, 
weatherproof relationship to establish. In the second half of 
1994 Bonn will assume the EU presidency, Paris in the first half 
year of 1995. The challenges for Europe remain -- in the East 
and in the Mediterranean, even though this is where Europe has 
failed. This forces the two partners to come up with joint 
concepts unless the two successive presidencies are intended to 
inaugurate a lost year.
