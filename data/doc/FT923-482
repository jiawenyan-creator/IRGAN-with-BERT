FT  28 SEP 92 / Margins on food maintained
BRITISH FOOD manufacturers have maintained their profit margins and rates of
return on capital during the recession in spite of a sharp decline in
profits growth in the past three years, according to a survey of 112
companies published by The Grocer magazine, Guy de Jonquieres writes.
The survey, by OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants, finds that operating margins in
1991-92 averaged 7.1 per cent, slightly higher than in the previous year and
the same as in 1989-90. Return on capital, at 18.7 per cent, was the same as
in 1990-91, though below the 20 per cent achieved in 1989-90. But average
operating profit in the most recent year grew by only 4.2 per cent compared
with 3.4 per cent a year before and 17.9 per cent three years ago.
