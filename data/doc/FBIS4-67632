"TB Among Homeless Increasing"] 
  [Text] There are more cases of tuberculosis in Britain than 
had been thought, according to a survey that says one in 50 
homeless people may have the disease. Crisis, the homeless 
charity, suggests the numbers affected have reached levels of 
developing countries and New York, where drug-resistant strains 
have emerged. 
  The number of cases in Britain has risen by nearly a fifth 
over the past six years and doctors expect 6,000 to be reported 
this year. The sharpest increase has been among women aged 
25-44. The disease was declining until the mid-1980s. 
  Dr John Moore-Gillon, consultant lung specialist at St 
Bartholomew's Hospital, London, said: "The figures from the 
Crisis survey don't surprise me. But if confirmed, they will 
show the level is higher than we realised." 
  Overcrowding, homelessness and the increase in refugees from 
countries where TB is endemic are blamed for the rising 
incidence.
