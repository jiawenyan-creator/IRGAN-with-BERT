FT  17 AUG 92 / Brazilians wear black
Brazilians delivered a sharp rebuff yesterday to President Fernando Collor
de Mello, ignoring his plea to wear the national colours to demonstrate
opposition to the corruption charges threatening his government, Reuter
reports from Rio de Janeiro.
Tens of thousands of people in the main cities instead heeded an opposition
call to wear black in mourning for their corruption- and inflation-plagued
country.
