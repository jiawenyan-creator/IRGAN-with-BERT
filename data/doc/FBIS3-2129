  [Text] Hong Kong, March 3 (XINHUA) -- Chinese officials in 
Hong Kong had reservations about the forecast reserves to be 
inherited by the future Special Administrative Region (SAR) of 
Hong Kong after Financial Secretary Hamish MacLeod delivered the 
1994/95 budget. 
  According to MacLeod's budget presented Wednesday [2 March], 
the reserves for the future SAR Government are estimated to hit 
269 billion H.K. dollars (about 34.487 billion U.S. dollars) 
after transfer of power in 1997. 
  Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong 
Kong branch, said he welcomed MacLeod's statement that there 
would be more than 100 billion H.K. dollars (about 12.82 billion 
U.S. dollars) left in the government's reserves after 1997. 
  "If they are able to write it down, then we welcome it and 
hope they do what they say," Zhang said. 
  Zheng Guoxiong, another deputy director of XINHUA branch, 
said the financial arrangements for 1994/95 should follow the 
principle of keeping the expenditures within the limits of 
income. 
  Meanwhile, Tam Yiu-chung from the Democratic Alliance for 
the 
Betterment of Hong Kong, criticized the budget for failing to 
take measures to bring down inflation and property prices. 
  Huang Chen-ya of the United Democrats also criticized the 
government for not doing enough to combat property speculation. 
  Fred Li of the meeting point welcomed cuts in salaries tax 
but said his party did not accept one-percent cut of profits tax. 
  Editorials of WEN WEI PO and HONG KONG COMMERCIAL DAILY 
doubted the real motive of the government in the record-breaking 
tax giveaway.
