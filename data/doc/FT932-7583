FT  22 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Economic recovery hopes
leave Nikkei 1.1% ahead
INDEX-linked purchases by investment trust companies triggered a
short-covering rally in the stock index futures markets, lifting the Nikkei
average by 1.1 per cent in late activity, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average ended 227.08 higher at 20,557.47, and up 0.1 per cent
on the week, after trading between 20,297.76 and 20,653.85. The Topix Index
of all first section issues ended 18.79 higher at 1,613.12 and, in London,
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.69 to 1,244.25.
Volume was 400m shares, compared with Thursday's 349m. Advances led declines
by 765 to 250 with 162 unchanged.
Brokers said that comments from Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan
governor, that the nation's economy should recover in the second half of
this financial year encouraged some buying. Investors, equally, continued to
select issues with favourable earnings, or at the lower end of their trading
range.
An analyst at a big four Japanese broker said that he expects major
institutional investors to shift funds into equities after the earnings
season ends in about two weeks. Until then, however, trading volume on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange should remain light.
Buying from investment trusts boosted issues in the shipbuilding sector.
Hitachi Zosen, the day's most active issue, gained Y26 to Y603, Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries Y28 to Y734 and Sasebo Heavy Industries Y13 to Y607.
Consumer electronic issues saw buying. Pioneer Electronic rose Y130 to
Y2,520, TDK by Y50 to Y3,990 and Sony by Y50 to Y4,730.
But Nihon Unisys, the importer and computer marketer, dropped Y40 at Y1,420
on reports that the nation's securities watchdog had asked prosecutors to
indict two people for allegedly manipulating the company's stock.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 213.24 higher at 22,722.58, in volume of
24.5m shares.
Roundup
With a few exceptions, Pacific Rim markets tended to move on to the
downgrade.
AUSTRALIA finished the week on a strong note, supported by a strong banking
sector, Wall Street's advance and a recovery in the three month futures
contract.
The All Ordinaries index closed up 11.4 points at 1,695.6, little changed on
the week, in turnover of ADollars 342.36m.
The banking sector index gained 49.9 or 2.2 per cent to 2,335.8. National
Australia Bank soared 27 cents to a record ADollars 9.73 in response to
interim net profits which rose to ADollars 507.3m. Westpac, which reported a
ADollars 204.6m net loss, jumped near the close to finish 9 cents ahead at
ADollars 3.70.
On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the June Share Price Index contract rose 30
to a high of 1,703 before edging back to close at 1,694, with 1,539
contracts traded.
SEOUL gained for the fifth consecutive session but ended only fractionally
firmer as selling of large-capitalisation shares offset most of the solid
gains posted by small and medium-sized companies.
The composite index added 0.62 to 727.99, 3.1 per cent higher on the week.
TAIWAN was lower in thin trade which left the weighted index down 46.38 or
1.1 per cent at 4,300.25, for a weekly fall of 5.8 per cent. Turnover
totalled TDollars 23.2bn after Thursday's TDollars 25.1bn.
Investors were discouraged by conflict within the ruling Nationalist Party
ahead of its congress in August, poor April export order figures, and fears
that the government would revise down its 6.6 per cent GNP growth forecast
for this year. Financial shares again led the day's falls, with Cathay Life
Insurance sinking TDollars 4 to TDollars 170.
NEW ZEALAND drifted to a lower close, due mostly to minor falls in the
leading stocks, in quiet trade. The NZSE-40 capital index dipped 8.85 to
1,618.60, 2.4 per cent up on the week. Telecom shed 2 cents to Dollars 3.00
after its record high on Thursday.
SINGAPORE saw a third straight day of profit-taking which left the Straits
Times Industrial index 14.54 lower at 1,861.86, little changed on the week,
with activity dominated by speculative Malaysian stocks traded over the
counter.
BANGKOK lost ground as disappointment over worse-than-expected earnings this
week soured the mood. The SET index shed 7.24 to 858.37, 2.6 per cent lower
on the week, in moderate volume.
BOMBAY moved up after a two-day closure for settlement work, the BSE index
closing 47.74 higher at 2,357.71. Brokers said that the market had
stabilised, and there were rumours that the BSE might even lift restrictions
on short sales.
