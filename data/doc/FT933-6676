FT  26 AUG 93 / Observer: Holy round
Now that lust has faded from the headlines, fear of unemployment seems to be
the number one concern troubling Ireland's priests.
There are just too many of them. 'Let's face it,' writes Father Brendan
Hoban of County Mayo in a magazine for priests, 'many priests wake up in the
morning wondering how they are going to pass the day.'
Clergy line up to say a few words at wedding receptions and death notices
are desperately scanned to find a funeral to attend. 'Everywhere we go now,
we are tripping over each other,' continues Hoban.
'Most of us seem to spend our time answering invitations to social
functions, breeding horses, training juveniles, celebrating jubilees, and
pricing cars.
It's becoming almost impossible to get a game of golf on the clergy
circuit.'
