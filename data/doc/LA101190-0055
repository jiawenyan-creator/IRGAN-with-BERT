VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA; 
OFFICIAL RESIGNS TO ACCEPT NEW JOB 
Robert Livingston, who has served as Santa Paula's administrator and city 
manager for the past four years, is resigning and will move to University Park, 
Tex., in January, according to Mayor Kay Wilson. 
"It is a good professional move for me, although we've enjoyed our time here," 
said Livingston, who will assume duties as administrator of the city, which is 
near Dallas. 
"I view it as a personal loss for the city. Bob has brought many special 
talents to us. We hate to lose him, but we wish him nothing but the best," 
Wilson said. 
Paul Eckert, assistant to Livingston, characterized his supervisor's style of 
management as open and approachable. 
"I hope we can find someone as excellent as Bob," Eckert said. 
Recruitment for the position, which pays about $68,000 annually depending on 
experience, will begin later this month and last through November. The City 
Council hopes to appoint a new manager by mid- to late December, Eckert said.
