FT  15 MAR 93 / Letter: Recognition for role of engineering
Sir, The 'Personal View' of Dr Pendlebury and Mr Shipley (March 3) should be
read by all who want to stem the recent tide of decline in manufacturing in
the UK. The task may not be as difficult as might be imagined.
Recognition that an engineering career is vital to the wealth creation
process is recognised in France and Germany, where a university engineering
course is prized by students and encouraged by parents. In Singapore, an
early education incorporating experience and practice in engineering is
understood to be an excellent entry into senior positions in government,
commerce and business. Surely it should not be difficult to appreciate that
this hands-on experience is more relevant to national success than an
Oxbridge 'greats' degree.
The mood of change could be rapid as evidenced by the prime minister's
reported comments on the importance of manufacturing ('Major urges companies
to be aggressive', March 4). However, it is also vital that the industrial
leaders in manufacturing recognise this change and promote the training and
recognition of all engineers.
I would thus only add to the Personal View the comment that chartered
engineers have a prime responsibility to ensure that the support role of
incorporated engineers and engineering technicians is championed as well.
