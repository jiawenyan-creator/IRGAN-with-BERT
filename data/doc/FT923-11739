FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Zinc price helps Cominco
turnround
A SHARP rise in zinc prices helped push Cominco, the Canadian base metals
and fertiliser producer, back into the black in the second quarter.
Earnings were CDollars 18.1m, (USDollars 15m), or 22 cents a share, up from
CDollars 7.3m, or eight cents a share, a year earlier. The company suffered
a CDollars 4.9m loss in the first quarter of 1992.
Sales rose to CDollars 416.6m from CDollars 386.1m.
The zinc price was about 20 per cent higher in the second quarter than a
year earlier. In spite of a fall in prices for other metals, sales volumes
of lead and nickel climbed substantially. Operating profit from mining and
minerals climbed to CDollars 146.1m from CDollars 132m.
Fertiliser volumes were higher, but were offset by a continued slide in
prices. Operating profit from fertilisers advanced to CDollars 22.4m from
CDollars 18.1m.
Cominco confirmed that a decision on the future of its troubled lead smelter
at Trail, British Columbia, has been delayed until late this year or early
1993. The company said its Quebrada Bianca project in Chile was scheduled to
be brought on stream in mid-1994.
Rio Algom, a diversified Canadian mining group formerly 51 per cent
controlled by RTZ, recorded higher second-quarter earnings with better
potash and copper results and a more favourable exchange rate. But
performance of its uranium, coal and metals distribution units weakened.
Profits were CDollars 8.2m, or 17 cents a share, against CDollars 6.4m, or
13 cents a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 264m against CDollars 267m.
First-half earnings dipped to CDollars 13m, or 27 cents a share, from
CDollars 20.4m, or 44 cents, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 507m
against CDollars 540m.
The 1992 period included a special loss of CDollars 5.8m by its Nova Scotia
tin mining operation recently shut down. Also uranium, metals distribution
and investment income was lower. Earlier this month RTZ completed the sale
of its 51.5 per cent interest for CDollars 362m through a secondary
offering.
