FT  17 MAR 92 / Finns protest EC debate
Some 2,000 Finns joined a protest rally outside the parliament building
yesterday as deputies inside the chamber began debating the government
proposal to seek membership of the European Community, police said, Reuter
reports from Helsinki.
The rally, which was organised by the Alternative to the EC movement,
follows the lighting of bonfire beacons along main roads at the weekend by
hundreds of farmers who fear the loss of big subsidies to the farming sector
if Finland joins the Community.
Bonfire beacons are an ancient way of warning that an enemy was approaching,
said a spokeswoman for the Central Union of Finnish Agricultural producers.
