FT  07 JUN 93 / Fresh drive on Ulster talks
SIR Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, is making fresh efforts to
restart talks between the province's four main constitutional parties,
officials at the Northern Ireland Office confirmed yesterday.
A series of meetings has been fixed and draft proposals which Sir Patrick
hopes might form the basis for a resumption of negotiations are to be put
before each of the party leaders at separate meetings.
The Irish government has not agreed to the formula and is working on its own
set of proposals. Mr John Major, prime minister, is expected to meet Mr
Albert Reynolds, prime minister of the Irish Republic, this month.
