FT  24 SEP 93 / Property: Commercial property investment returns fall
RETURNS on commercial property investments fell marginally in August,
according to the Investment Property Databank, a research group, writes
Vanessa Houlder.
The IPD all-property return fell to 1.1 per cent, the result of a reduction
in the rate of capital growth by 0.1 percentage points to 0.4 per cent in
August. Yields were shaved off all sectors in August, although the aggregate
equivalent yield was unchanged at 9.7 per cent.
With the rate of decline in rental values slowing for the fourth consecutive
month, to -0.5 per cent, IPD said there were now indications that the low
point in values was not far off.
Total returns were up to 5.2 per cent, while the rate of decline in capital
and rental values slowed to -3.9 per cent and -10.4 per cent, respectively.
Office and industrial property showed a total return of 1.2 percentage
points in August. Returns on the industrial sector increased by 0.2
percentage points, while office total returns increased by 0.1 percentage
points. Retails fell back into third place, recording a return of 1
percentage point.
