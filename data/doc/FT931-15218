FT  14 JAN 93 / Airport traffic grows by 10%
PASSENGER traffic at Britain's main airports grew by more than 10 per cent
last year compared with 1991, confirming the recovery in air travel after
the decline caused by the Gulf War. But the economic slowdown in the UK and
several other industrialised countries continued to affect the overall
recovery in the air transport industry.
