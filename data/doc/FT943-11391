FT  30 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Investment most pressing economic
issue
Sir, As large suppliers of capital equipment in the UK, we have noted with
interest the attention given this week to the subject of investment and are
delighted that, at long last, the matter is becoming more important ('CBI
urges tax changes to aid investment', July 28).
Given the fact that we have such beneficial economic conditions, it should
be of great concern for the longer term that the Confederation of British
Industry trends survey showed such a small number of manufacturers planning
to invest in plant and machinery in the future. The UK has always been the
poor relation of the developed economies as far as investment is concerned.
UK machine tool manufacturers are doing extremely well on the back of strong
growth overseas, while the UK market remains relatively poor. Without
vitally needed investment in high technology, plant and equipment, UK
manufacturing cannot hope to close the 25 per cent gap in productivity which
the government identified in the recent white paper. While a highly skilled
workforce is of course essential, it becomes academic if it has to work on
outdated equipment. We agree completely with the need to be competitive, to
be benchmarked against our foreign competition and the need to increase our
productivity, but all are fundamentally relative to investment.
Manufacturing investment should be the most important economic issue facing
the UK today. The chancellor should use his forthcoming budget to address
the UK's investment deficiency as low interest rates and inflation are
obviously not sufficient for growth.
