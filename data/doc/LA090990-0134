PLANNERS' REJECTION OF N. COUNTY LANDFILL SITES IS FAR TOO HASTY; 
SUPERVISORS SHOULD REVERSE THAT DECISION 
Since 1985, county staff members have been searching for the right site for a 
North County landfill. During those five long years, they have trimmed the list 
from 168 candidates to the three they presented to the Planning Commission on 
Aug. 31. 
But the Planning Commission, in refusing to approve a necessary zoning change 
and certify an environmental impact report, would have the staff go out and 
evaluate still more sites. That process could add a year or more to the search 
for a new dump. 
Why the hasty rejection? The Board of Supervisors should take its staff's 
recommendation and reverse the decision to dismiss these sites out of hand. 
Then the board should commission further study of possible ground-water 
contamination that the Planning Commissioners found so daunting. 
The time for a new North County landfill is here. If not expanded, the San 
Marcos dump will reach its 7-million-ton capacity next year; if it is expanded, 
the landfill might last until 1995. 
Even if North County residents ultimately are willing to pay the expense of 
trucking trash to existing landfills in other parts of the county, there are 
perhaps 10 years until space runs out. 
That's how long it took Orange County to site the Bee Canyon landfill it opened 
earlier this year, because of the complicated permit process involved. 
That facility is described as the high-tech landfill of the future, with clay 
and polyethylene liners and a sophisticated drainage system to protect the 
ground water below. 
Could such a system be successfully installed here? We'll never know if the 
supervisors follow the planning commissioners' lead and take these landfill 
sites off the list prematurely.
