  [Text] Felipe Gonzalez has decided to postpone the official 
visit to Romania and Bulgaria scheduled for next week, according 
to a communique released this afternoon by the Government 
Spokesman's Office. This decision may be linked with the 
request made by the Popular Party group and the United Left in 
the Congress of Deputies for Felipe Gonzalez to appear 
immediately before a plenary session of the chamber to explain 
the causes which allowed Luis Roldan to flee and the tendering 
of his resignation by the interior minister.
