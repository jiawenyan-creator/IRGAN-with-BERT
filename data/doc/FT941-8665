FT  18 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: GKN/Westland
There is an air of unreality about GKN's bid for Westland. While technically
a hostile offer, it has been couched in very conciliatory terms. Sir David
Lees, GKN's chairman, clearly hoped that a recommendation might be
forthcoming, and the company seems slightly embarrassed that it is attacking
a board whose non-executives include a GKN appointee. Equally, Westland's
remarks, while urging no action, have been cautiously neutral. GKN's 45 per
cent holding also lends a certain inevitability to proceedings.
The phoney war may be about to hot up. Westland's resolve to fight seems to
be hardening as it reviews its prospects. Its chances of survival will hinge
on persuading investors that some large potential orders for the EH101
helicopter will be translated into sales. That might just paint a
sufficiently attractive prospect to put Westland's shares above the price
GKN was prepared to pay. There is also the ticklish question for the
Takeover Panel of what exactly would be required for GKN to claim control,
since the exercise of convertible rights could dilute GKN's stake down to 40
per cent over the next year.
On the other side, GKN will have to work hard to persuade investors of the
industrial logic of its argument. It must also convince Westland
shareholders to accept its cash because prospects are uncertain, while
hoping its shareholders will take up the rights issue because Westland is
attractive. The gentlemanly conduct of debate so far has been a credit to
both sides. With the complex issues far from settled, the combatants will do
well if they can keep it that way.
