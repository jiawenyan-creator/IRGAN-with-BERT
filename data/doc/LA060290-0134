CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS: THE AD CAMPAIGN 
The race: Insurance commissioner: Whose ads? Democratic candidates Bill Press, 
John Garamendi and Conway Collis. 
Press has a new 30-second commercial that attacks two leading opponents, 
Garamendi and Collis, as servants of special interests -- Garamendi of insurers 
and Collis of corporate donors. Garamendi has a 30-second commercial that 
pledges to make every insurance company obey Proposition 103. Collis has a 
30-second commercial that reports he scored highest on a Ralph Nader 
questionnaire of the insurance commissioner candidates. 
Elements of the ads, with an analysis by Times staff writer Kenneth Reich: 
Ad: Press' commercial declares, "As a state legislator, Garamendi took over 
$100,000 from the insurance industry. And now he's been endorsed by the 
insurance industry's lobby. As an elected official, Conway Collis took money 
from corporations and voted them millions in tax breaks. Maybe that's why the 
Democratic Party rejected them and endorsed Bill Press. . . . Bill Press. He's 
on our side." 
Analysis: Garamendi has taken at least $123,000 in his 16 years in the 
Legislature from insurers, a little under $8,000 a year, but he has not taken 
anything from them since announcing for insurance commissioner, and he 
repudiated the endorsement of the legal reform group that Press is referring to 
here. That group, the Assn. for Tort Reform, has been accused of being a front 
for the industry but is not its major lobby. Collis, before 1986, did take 
thousands of dollars in contributions from corporations while occasionally 
voting as a State Board of Equalization member to allow them to pay less taxes 
than the board staff recommended. Since 1986, he says, he has changed his 
policy and will not vote on any matter relating to a party from which he has 
received a contribution. He acknowledges some oversights, but he maintains he 
has "learned" to be a better elected official in recent years. What Press does 
not say in these ads is that, much more than either Garamendi or Collis, he has 
raised money in the insurance commissioner's campaign from one of the major 
special interests in the insurance issue, the trial lawyers. Those 
contributions now amount to at least $273,500. Press does have the official 
endorsement of the Democratic Party. 
Ad: Garamendi's commercial says that "Roxani Gillespie, the Republican 
insurance commissioner, exempted hundreds of companies from Prop. 103's 
requirement to lower insurance rates. We need an insurance commissioner who 
will fight for the people! Democratic Sen. John Garamendi! Sixteen years' 
experience standing up to big corporations." Garamendi then follows the 
announcer and says, "As insurance commissioner, I'll make every insurance 
company obey Proposition 103." 
Analysis: Gillespie indicated last summer she would exempt hundreds of 
companies from Proposition 103 rollbacks, but later reversed herself and left 
the issue open. She has not yet made a single final decision on a rate rollback 
for any company. Garamendi, as a state senator, has earned a reputation for 
standing against many special interests, although he has also voted for many 
bills desired by corporations, as virtually all legislators have. The last 
sentence is a promise Garamendi has made in his campaign. He has repeatedly 
vowed to "clean up the insurance mess," language similar to that used by most 
of the other Democrats. 
Ad: Collis' commercial starts with him reiterating that he would be the 
toughest enforcer of Proposition 103, but then an announcer declares: "We 
interrupt this message to bring you a special announcement. Ralph Nader has 
just announced the results of a consumer survey of candidates for insurance 
commissioner. In this survey, Conway Collis scored No. 1." That news is 
repeated four more times in the next few seconds, and Collis appears once more 
in the midst of the repeats saying, "I'll do whatever it takes to make 103 
work." 
Analysis: Collis scored highest, edging candidate Ray Bourhis, in answering a 
Nader questionnaire on policies he would follow as commissioner. But several 
other leading candidates, including Garamendi, Press, Walter Zelman and 
Republican Wes Bannister, refused to answer the questions on grounds that the 
survey was prepared to favor Collis. Nader has stopped short of endorsing 
Collis. As for making Proposition 103 "work," this may be more in the hands of 
the courts than the insurance commissioner.
