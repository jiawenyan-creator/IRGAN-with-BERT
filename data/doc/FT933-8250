FT  17 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Commercial traveller sees the world
Sir, I was interested to read of Peter Job's travels (Observer, 'On the
job', August 6).
My own travels this year have covered 27 countries (including holidays and
excluding repeat visits). Throughout my career the number is 199. I suspect,
however, that I am much older than Mr Job]
