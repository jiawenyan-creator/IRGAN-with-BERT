Thunderstorms flinging hail and fierce winds damaged cars in Tennessee and 
toppled trees in Virginia, as warm air spread along the Atlantic Coast, setting 
temperature records. The National Weather Service said a cold front clashed 
with a mass of warm, moist air over the Appalachians, triggering the stormy 
afternoon weather. Weather service spokesman Brian Smith said hail damaged 
automobiles at Copperhill, Tenn., and McCaysville, Ga., while in Virginia, 
winds gusted to 81 m.p.h. at Virginia Beach and 69 m.p.h. at the Norfolk Naval 
Air Station. Temperatures rose into the 50s and 60s over much of New England, 
reaching a record 76 in Baltimore.
