SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
Pessimistic traders and short-sellers had their wish come true as the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average fell 78 points, or 3.3%, over the past two trading days, 
Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas Green/San Diego Securities, said 
Monday. 
The drop followed the announcement that the producer price index had increased 
1% in February or 12.6% on an annual basis, portending a distinct inflationary 
environment in the near future. 
Interest-sensitive stocks were particularly affected as HomeFed Corp., parent 
of Home Federal Savings, was down $1.50 and Great American First Savings Bank 
fell $.875. Home Federal had reached a new 52-week high of $33.375 earlier in 
the week. 
Other stocks selling off were Henley Group, down $4; Rohr Industries, down 
$2.50; Xytronyx, down $1.25; and Magma Power and Mail Boxes Etc., each down $1. 
New lows were recorded during the past week by Synbiotics and Syntro, a pair of 
local biotechnology companies. 
The largest gainer of the week was Pancretec, which hit a new high of $14.50 in 
response to a bid by Abbott Laboratories to acquire the company for $15 a 
share, or $54 million. The stock, which sold at $1.50 in December, 1987, was 
selling at $9.625 just two weeks ago. 
"It would appear that some (Pancretec) investors were very prescient about the 
company's future," Katz said, referring to the more than 40% run-up in 
Pancretec's stock price over the past two weeks. 
Other stocks, including Humphrey, Molecular Biosystems, DH Technology, and 
General Microelectronics reached 52-week highs last week but were unable to 
sustain them when the market dropped.
