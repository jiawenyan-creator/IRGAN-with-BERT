SINGBANDITH SIGNS WITH NEBRASKA 
Phouphet Singbandith of Magnolia High School, the Orange County record-holder 
in the triple jump, signed a national letter of intent Sunday to attend 
Nebraska, Nebraska Coach Gary Pepin said Monday. 
Singbandith is the national prep leader in the triple jump this season with his 
leap of 50-feet 3/4 inches at the Arcadia Invitational earlier this month. 
"We've really been recruiting him, mail-wise, since last year," Pepin said. "I 
think he's got a lot of potential and, on top of that, he's a real good student 
and a very humble young man. He's a good little technician for a high school 
jumper." 
Singbandith, a native of Laos, is a two-time defending county champion in the 
triple jump and long jump. Saturday, he won the triple jump at the Mt. San 
Antonio College Relays for the second consecutive year. Last year after 
finishing second in both jumps at the Southern Section 2-A finals, Singbandith, 
plagued by knee and ankle injuries, placed seventh in the state meet. 
Singbandith, who will study engineering at Nebraska, has not visited the 
Cornhusker campus, but plans to in the next few weeks. 
Nebraska has won six of the last 10 Big Eight championships in men's track and 
field, including the 1989 indoor and outdoor titles. 
Singbandith's signing marks the second county track and field athlete to commit 
to a Big Eight Conference school in the last two weeks. Last week, Mission 
Viejo's Lisa Fager, the county record-holder in the girls' triple jump, signed 
with Kansas State. BARBIE LUDOVISE
