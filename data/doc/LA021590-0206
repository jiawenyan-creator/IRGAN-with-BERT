RUSHDIE WILL BE KILLED EVENTUALLY, IRANIANS DECLARE 
Iranian radical leaders said Wednesday that no matter how closely he is 
guarded, British author Salman Rushdie will be killed in accordance with the 
edict issued by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini just months before his death. 
Parliament Speaker Mahdi Karrubi and Parliament member Ali Akbar Mohtashemi 
spoke to Iran's Parliament on the one-year anniversary of Khomeini's death 
sentence against Rushdie, who is accused of blaspheming Islam in his novel "The 
Satanic Verses." 
Rushdie has been in hiding under guard since Feb. 14, 1989. 
"Neither the passage of time nor Salman Rushdie's repentence" will affect the 
death edict, said Mohtashemi, the former interior minister and a hard-liner in 
the Iranian Parliament, was quoted as saying by the official Islamic Republic 
News Agency. 
Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia as was the IRNA report, quoted Karrubi as 
telling legislators that "however much Salman Rushdie may be kept under guard, 
eventually a Muslim will carry out the edict." 
In recent interviews, Rushdie said his book was not meant to as an affront to 
Muslims, but he said that he stands by what he has written.
