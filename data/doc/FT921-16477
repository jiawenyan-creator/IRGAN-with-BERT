FT  03 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Caird raises Pounds 6.2m from dry waste
sale
CAIRD Group, the waste management company, has sold, for a total of Pounds
6.17m, a large part of its dry waste division to Cleanaway, the UK operation
of Brambles Industries, the Sydney-based transport and freight group.
Mr John Ashton, Caird chairman, said that the disposal was the latest step
in the company's strategy to concentrate on its core landfill and hazardous
waste treatment businesses.
This strategy was initiated in the face of the Pounds 78m hostile, but
eventually lapsed, bid in September 1990 from Severn Trent, the privatised
water company.
The disposed businesses consist of the English dry waste collection
activities but exclude the operation at Barrow, which is to be sold
separately.
In the 11 months to November 30, the businesses that Cleanaway is buying
made operating profits of Pounds 475,000 on revenues of Pounds 7.18m. The
consideration consists of a Pounds 5.42m cash payment and a further
estimated Pounds 745,000 after Caird has collected debts and paid off
outstanding amounts.
