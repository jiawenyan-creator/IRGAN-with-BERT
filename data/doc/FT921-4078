FT  11 MAR 92 / Order to council over refuse
MR Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, has ordered the refuse
collection service run by Labour-led Haringey council in London to be closed
next year.
The move follows allegations of anti-competitive behaviour by the council in
awarding itself a contract for refuse collection and street cleaning.
The environment department said the council accepted the bid from its own
direct service organisation in spite of lower bids from Onyx and BFI
Wastecare.
