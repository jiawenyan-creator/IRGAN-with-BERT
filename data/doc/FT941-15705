FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Fannie Mae posts record
The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) yesterday reported
record fourth quarter profits of Dollars 493.6m.
It predicted that the US housing market would continue its strong recovery
during 1994 thanks to a healthy economy, low interest rates and low
inflation.
In the same quarter a year ago, Fannie Mae earned Dollars 426.4m.
It was the 24th consecutive quarter of record earnings for the company,
which is the largest source of home mortgage funds in the US. Full-year 1993
profits reached Dollars 1.87bn, up from Dollars 1.62bn the year before.
The company's fourth quarter results were affected by Dollars 38.8m in
after-tax losses incurred because of the call of debt at a premium and the
repurchase of high coupon debt. The latest figures, however, also included
Dollars 28.3m in pre-payment fees from a special multi-family loan
refinancing programme, and a Dollars 15m contribution to the Fannie Mae
Foundation.
Mr James Johnson, Fannie Mae chairman and chief executive, hailed 1993 as an
'outstanding' year. He said the company was able to service a record 3.3m
families through mortgage purchases and security guarantees.
Net income rose sharply during the year because of three main factors: a 22
per cent increase in Fannie Mae's net mortgage portfolio to Dollars 190bn; a
45 per cent increase in REMIC (real estate mortgage investment conduits)
fees to Dollars 125.5m; and an 11 per cent increase in the balance of
outstanding mortgage-backed securities to Dollars 496bn.
Also during 1993, the number of foreclosed properties acquired by the
company rose 20 per cent to 11,557, but the single-family delinquency rate,
a key indicator of credit quality, declined over the year.
The quarterly and annual results initially triggered selling of Fannie Mae
shares before investors reacted more positively and the price rose Dollars 1
1/4 to close at Dollars 85 3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Student Loan Marketing Association said its student loan purchases rose
to Dollars 6.7bn in 1993, up Dollars 1bn from 1992, Reuter reports from
Washington.
'That enabled us to hold our share of what was a rapidly growing market in
1993 despite low interest rates and a slow economy that made it more
attractive for originating lenders to retain their loan production,' said Mr
Lawrence Hough, Sallie Mae president and chief executive.
