  [Text] Beijing, March 18 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese people are 
planting a tree belt along their 18,000-km coastline, according 
to the "China Environment Journal". 
  Work began in 1988, and the tree belt has extended 14,000 km 
so far and covered two million ha. 
  The professional paper noted that Fujian and Hainan 
Provinces 
and Qingdao city in Shandong Province have taken the lead in the 
work. 
  Fujian planted a 3,100-km-long tree belt along its coast and 
around nearby farmland last year. 
  Hainan now has a 1,400-km-long tree belt along its 1,500-km 
coast. 
  Qingdao has vowed to cover its remaining 15 km of coast with 
trees this year. 
  The paper noted that the construction of the "green wall" in 
the coastal areas has effectively weakened typhoons, tidal waves 
and rainstorms, protected stretches of farmland and improved 
ecological conditions.
