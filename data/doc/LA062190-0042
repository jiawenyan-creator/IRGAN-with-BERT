METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS 
Two men were arrested on suspicion of committing a yearlong string of sexual 
assaults by abducting women from San Fernando Valley streets at gunpoint and 
raping them on a remote ranch, police said Wednesday. 
Los Angeles police said Theodore Conyers, 26, of Acton and Paul McDaniels, 23, 
of Canyon Country raped women ranging in age from 12 to 31 in the guest house 
of a ranch in Acton, northeast of Santa Clarita, owned by a relative of 
Conyers. 
Both men were expected to be charged today with rape and kidnaping. Arraignment 
also was scheduled today in Van Nuys Municipal court. 
Detective Dave Dempsy declined to say how many women allegedly were raped. One 
of the two men has confessed to a string of such assaults, but thus far 
detectives have been able to identify only some of the victims, police said. 
Detectives hope other victims will come forward.
