FT  05 APR 94 / Observer: Walk-on part
By contrast, the fevered speculation about John Major's future has not
discouraged the equally hefty book at Westminster on who will get what in
the summer cabinet reshuffle. The presumption is that Major will have one
more stab at stamping his authority on the government before bowing to his
critics.
John Patten, 48, the ill-fated education secretary, is odds-on favourite
along with attorney-general Nicholas Lyell, 55, to be given the opportunity
to spend more time with his family. They might well be joined - voluntarily
 -by John MacGregor, 57, and Peter Brooke, 60. Douglas Hurd, 64, has decided
not to desert the sinking ship. Despite the ambitions of Virginia Bottomley,
46, David Hunt, 51, remains favourite for the party chairmanship.
But for those seeking an interesting long-shot, Observer hears that Major
may seek to coax Peter (now Lord) Walker, 62, back into the political fray.
Friends of Major say Walker's formidable political talents would make him an
ideal chairman.
Of course the Tory right would be infuriated but Major has lost them anyway.
