<ACTION>
action: 

Interim final rule with request for comment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This rule amends the Schedule of Consular Fees and the passport regulations to reflect that an additional fee will
be charged within the United States for expediting the processing of passports. The service will be provided upon
payment of the fee when requested by the applicant and justified by urgent departure plans.



The rule establishes what service is provided for the fee; establishes when the fee will be charged; sets the amount
of the fee; establishes the documentation the applicant will need to present to obtain the service; defines the limited
situations when the fee will not be charged; provides for a refund when expedited services cannot be given; and provides
that the after hours surcharge for consular services will not be charged within the United States.

supplementary information: 

On August 26, 1994, the President signed into law Public Law 103317, the Department of State and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act, 1995. The Diplomatic and Consular Programs appropriation in this Act provides that ``all receipts
received from a new charge from expedited passport processing'' shall, in effect, be retained by the Department of
State in the ``Diplomatic and Consular Programs account'' and available until expended. See S. Rept. 103309,
at 123 (July 14, 1994).



To utilize this new fee retention authority consistent with congressional intent, the Department of State is, in
this rule, establishing a new fee for expedited passport processing. The Department already has specific authority
to establish passport fees under 22 U.S.C. 214, as amended (which normally requires that fees be collected into the
U.S. Treasury). The Department also is authorized to establish fees for passport related services under 31 U.S.C.
9701, a reference to which is being added to the authorities section of 22 CFR part 51.

Public Law 103317 authorizes the Department to retain the new fee for expedited passport processing.

The Schedule of Fees for Consular Services, 22 CFR 22.1 is amended to add Item 14, Passport Expedite Fee and to limit
the application of the after hours fee, Item 93, to posts abroad. The after-hours fee has been used domestically only
in cases where passport agencies were open after hours to process urgent passport requests. These costs will now be
subsumed in the expedited processing fee. 22 CFR part 51 is amended to add section 51.67 to provide for the expedited
processing of a passport within the United States upon payment of the passport expedite fee. Section 51.64(f) is added
to provide for a refund of the expedite fee when the expedited service is not, in fact, provided.

The new fee will be in addition to any other applicable fee. The expedite fee will not cover the cost of urgent mailing
fees, if required.
