THE WORLD 
The U.S. Air Force canceled all its air shows in West Germany for 1989, six 
months after the Ramstein Air Base crash that killed 70 people and injured 
hundreds, a military spokesman at the base said. Three Italian stunt jets 
collided in flight over Ramstein on Aug. 28, and one of the flaming planes 
plowed into a crowd of spectators. That crash, and a series of allied training 
flight crashes in West Germany last year that killed more than 100 people, 
caused a public outcry and demands for a stop to low-level military flights.
