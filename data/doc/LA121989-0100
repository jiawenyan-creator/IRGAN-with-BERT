FARWEST MAKES ACTING CHIEF PERMANENT 
Charles H. Green, who has been the acting president at FarWest Savings &amp; 
Loan since February, took over the duties of president and chief operating 
officer on a permanent basis Monday, the S&amp;L said. 
Green also will retain his position as chief financial officer of the thrift's 
holding company parent, FarWest Financial Corp. in Beverly Hills. 
Green, a longtime commercial banker, has been with FarWest since 1984. He is 
overseeing a restructuring of the S&amp;L, which includes employee layoffs and 
a reduction in assets from $4.8 billion to as low as $3.5 billion. 
Many thrifts are undergoing similar changes to comply with more stringent 
federal requirements that were part of the industry bailout law enacted in 
August. 
The law created three tests for capital -- an institution's final reserve 
against losses -- and forced S&amp;Ls to sell their portfolios of high-risk 
corporate securities known as junk bonds. FarWest doesn't meet two of the three 
capital requirements and took a $22.9-million loss for the third quarter 
because it had to write down the value of its junk bond holdings. 
Green was given control of FarWest in late February when the S&amp;L's 
president at the time, Victor H. Indiek, and a top aide were fired for making 
unauthorized investments with depositor funds. 
The aide, Ronald D. Struck, then FarWest's chief financial officer, had 
previously been warned about his failure to follow the S&amp;L's policies on 
investments, FarWest executives said at the time. And Indiek, who had 
handpicked Struck for the post, knew about previous improper investments by 
Struck and was held accountable. 
FarWest said it did not lose any money on those investments.
