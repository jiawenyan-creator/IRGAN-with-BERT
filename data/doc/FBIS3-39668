  [Text] Turkey has been slinking around in the past few days 
and, instigated by military circles, is creating an artificial 
crisis that thickens the cloud over the Balkans. This appraisal 
was outlined by Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias at the 
Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee meeting during the 
debate on the bill on establishing embassies in Croatia and 
Slovenia and a consultate in Montenegro. The bill was passed 
unanimously. 
  During the debate, Papoulias said he could not express 
optimism and noted: I do not believe in a dynamic solution. I 
believe any bombings will aggravate the Balkan situation. Asked 
by deputies what would happen after the deadline set by the 
United Nations and NATO expires, Papoulias said nobody gave any 
answer to NATO and the European Union on whether the bombs would 
be the beginning of peace or a more general war. 
  On his meeting in Belgrade, Papoulias said he met patriotic 
steadfastness and that the Serbs showed they are prepared to 
confront any attack.
