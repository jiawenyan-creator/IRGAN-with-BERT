FT  25 AUG 93 / Observer: Pregnant pause
As schoolboys, Jones and Smith loathed each other; they never kept in touch.
Jones became a bishop and Smith an admiral. Years later, Jones is standing
at a station, in full episcopal regalia, waiting for a train. And, lo and
behold, there on the platform is the hated Smith, in admiral's braid and
cap.
Seizing the chance to score an unchristian point, Jones swishes up to his
old enemy and asks: 'What time is the Bath train expected, station master?'
Smith gives his old adversary a level, naval gaze and replies: 'It's due in
10 minutes - but I wouldn't advise travelling in your condition.'
