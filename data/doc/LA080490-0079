Jeffrey Modesitt, a former NFL player with the Cleveland Browns and Atlanta 
Falcons, was shot and killed early Friday during an argument outside a 
restaurant. 
Modesitt, 26, died from a bullet wound in the chest moments after exchanging 
words with a man, police said. 
Modesitt was with the Falcons briefly in training camp last season and was the 
driver in a traffic accident last year that killed Falcon tight end Brad 
Beckman.
