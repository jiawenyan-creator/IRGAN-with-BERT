WHO WILL HELP KIDS IF PARENTS DON'T? 
SWEET ALICE HARRIS of Parents of Watts was asked by The Times to comment on 
breaking the cycle of child neglect and failure in the schools. Some of her 
views: 
I think we should be focusing on elementary education, because if you get a 
good background, if they have a good foundation, you wouldn't have the problems 
you have now. 
You have a problem in junior high and high school when you test a student and 
he tests as a third- and fourth-grade reader . . . 
I think the problem is everybody's, the community, the parents, the churches, 
the organizations, the schools. We all ought to focus on early childhood 
education. 
We (the Parents of Watts) have a school next door, and that comes from us doing 
this. In the afternoon we have tutors. We have young people coming here in the 
afternoon to do their homework. The teachers are from the the school district, 
from John Locke Adult School. 
The students that stay in the tutoring class are the ones that we have in 
college. We should have tutoring in the afternoon in the churches. Every church 
in the area should be open, with a teacher. The school district should send a 
teacher to help them get their homework, because if the parent in the home is 
on a fixed income, on welfare, on drugs, whatever the reason, it's not the 
child's fault. But that's who suffers, because then we say, 'Well, they have a 
parent, let them do it.' And because the parent doesn't do it, the child 
becomes neglected. And then when they get to be teen-agers, they can fight out 
against (the neglect), then we say, 'What's gonna happen to our teen-agers?' 
Because we didn't take care of them when they were in elementary school.
