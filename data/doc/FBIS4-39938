  [Text] Moscow, 10 Jun -- The State Duma today adopted a 
resolution "On Including the Constitutional Rights of the 
Population to Self-government in the Normative Legal Acts of the 
Subjects of the Russian Federation." It draws the Russian 
Federation president's attention in particular to the need to 
adopt a series of measures to prevent violation of the 
population's constitutional rights to local self-government and 
measures to implement the constitutional rights of the 
population to ownership, use and charge of municipal property. 
It also draws attention to the rights of the bodies of local 
self-government to set up and implement local budgets 
independently. The resolution says the bodies of state power 
among the subjects of the Russian Federation must implement the 
clauses in the Constitution on elections to the bodies of local 
self-government and not allow the practice of postponing 
elections or of appointing the head of local self-government.
