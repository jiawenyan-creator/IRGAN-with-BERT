<F P=106> [Interview with LDP President Yohei Kono by unidentified </F>
YOMIURI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Reporter] How do you assess the coalition 
government? 
  [Kono] After the new government was inaugurated, a lot 
changed on the surface. But rather than make any new decisions, 
it has put off addressing difficult problems. I also sense a 
dual power structure. 
  [Reporter] How has the Diet been run in the beginning of the 
new year? 
  [Kono] The ruling parties forced deliberations on political 
reform to begin by insisting that "the Diet move quickly to open 
its session." They did not even allow us to have one hour to 
meet to make arrangements. We have insisted that the Diet 
should discuss not only political reform but also pump-priming 
measures, and we have called for the convening of a meeting of 
the budget committee. The ruling parties' position of not 
complying with our request is the same as the stand taken by the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] when we boycotted deliberations 
(in the upper house special committee on political reform). 
  [Reporter] Is the LDP considering overthrowing the cabinet? 
  [Kono] The main issue before the cabinet is how to protect 
the living standards of the people. If we find the cabinet 
incapable, we will have to consider overthrowing it. 
  [Reporter] Will you accept an offer to hold summit talks 
between yourself and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa? 
  [Kono) The ruling parties tend to refuse to consult in the 
final stage. They did so when they pushed through the extension 
of the Diet session. While running the Diet in such a fashion, 
they are calling for "summit talks." They are full of 
inconsistencies between their words and deeds. 
  [Reporter] Is the LDP considering drawing up a compromise 
political reform plan? 
  [Kono] It is important for us to organize our thoughts about 
a compromise political reform plan based on deliberations in the 
upper house and public hearings. 
  [Reporter] Some senior members in the ruling coalition have 
proposed a compromise plan of dividing the nation into electoral 
blocs for proportional representation voting. What do you think 
of this? 
  [Kono] I referred to electoral blocs when I asked Prime 
Minister Hosokawa during the last summit talks whether he 
intended to introduce a cross-prefecture electoral bloc system 
for proportional representation. In response, he said, "I have 
no intention of introducing that system." I do not think that 
the plan you mentioned will be discussed as a compromise 
measure. Moreover, many LDP members prefer prefectural 
electoral blocs. 
  [Reporter] The idea has surfaced within the LDP and the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] that a bill to prevent 
corruption should be separated from the other political reform 
bills to enact that one first. What do you think about this? 
  [Kono] Only a handful of LDP members advocate the idea. From 
the start, the LDP has called for enacting the four bills as one 
package. I do not think that the separation (of one bill from 
the others) is a good idea. But I support the idea of dealing 
with economic recovery and political reform at the same time. 
Each cabinet has a different capacity. The present cabinet 
seems to think that it can only handle political reform, but it 
must also deal with the economy. It is natural for us to ask 
the cabinet to direct part of the energy it is spending on 
political reform to the economy. 
  [Reporter] How will you operate the LDP "when some LDP 
members are prepared to leave the party?" 
  [Kono] In this difficult situation, four members have left 
the party. But the LDP as a whole is moving in the same 
direction. It is true that there is a proreform group and a 
group that takes a cautious approach toward political reform. 
Nevertheless, I hope that all LDP members will reach the goal 
of political reform together. I believe that once the political 
reform issue is settled, the LDP will be able to display its 
innate ability.
