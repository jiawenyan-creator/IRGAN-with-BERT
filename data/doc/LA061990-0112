PATHE SAYS TALKS TO BUY MGM ARE CONTINUING 
Pathe Communications late Monday said it was "continuing discussions" about 
details of a plan under which Time Warner Inc. is to back Pathe's $1.2-billion 
bid for MGM/UA Communications Co., despite widespread reports that the talks 
had broken down. 
Beverly Hills-based Pathe also confirmed earlier reports that it might extend a 
June 23 deadline by which it was supposed to conclude its $20-a-share tender 
offer for MGM/UA. 
Pathe shares fell 50 cents to $3.875 on the New York Stock Exchange, while 
MGM/UA shares dropped 37.5 cents to $18.25 amid persistent rumors that Time 
Warner was pulling out of a deal under which it is to provide $650 million of 
Pathe's financing. 
"They're still on," one top Warner executive said of the talks. 
Another individual close to the discussions said: "We have something between a 
happy marriage and what you're hearing (about a breakdown in negotiations)." 
Pathe President Giancarlo Parretti has been struggling to conclude financing 
arrangements for the MGM/UA acquisition, which had been scheduled to close 
earlier this month. 
In Monday's statement, Pathe said a separate company owned by Pathe Chairman 
Florio Fiorini, Sasea Holding, had failed to conclude a sale of shares in Banca 
Agricola Milanese to Centro Nord Commissionaria, which was to have provided $52 
million in financing for the deal. But Sasea and another company owned by 
Parretti raised the financing by selling other securities, Pathe said.
