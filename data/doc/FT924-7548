FT  16 NOV 92 / Observer: Child's play
Word has reached Observer of a customer revolt at Child &amp; Co, London's
oldest bank. The upmarket private bank across the road from the Law Courts
has started charging members of the founding family - patriarch the Earl of
Jersey - for the honour of looking after their money.
After enjoying free banking for over 300 years the descendants of Sir
Francis Child and the Countess of Jersey have been asked to pay Pounds 25 a
month if the balance of their account dips below Pounds 1,500. This seems an
awful lot even for members of the landed gentry.
The Royal Bank of Scotland, which owns the bank, refuses to comment. But one
scion of the family, who was 'given' his bank account at the age of 13, is
outraged. He and his father have both closed their accounts and expect
several of their relatives to follow their example.
So much for Child's motto that 'the more impersonal other banks become the
greater this business will grow'.
