SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 



In 1985, the Department issued a countervailing duty order on Certain Textile Mill Products from Argentina (C357404)
(50 FR 9846; March 12, 1985). The scope of this order was originally defined solely in terms of the Tariff Schedules
of the United States Annotated (TSUSA) item numbers; no narrative product description was provided. On January 1,
1989, the United States fully converted from the TSUSA to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). Section 1211 of the
Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 directed the Department to ``take whatever actions are necessary to
conform, to the fullest extent practicable, with the tariff classification system of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
[for] all *** orders ***'' in effect at the time of the implementation of the HTS. 

Accordingly, on January 11, 1989, after reviewing comments received from the public, the Department published the
1989 Conversion for all antidumping and countervailing duty orders in effect or investigations in progress as of
January 1, 1989 (54 FR 993). The notice also included the conversion of the scope of the referenced textile mill product
order from TSUSA to HTS item numbers. The 1989 Conversion was based on a one-to-one correspondence of the TSUSA and
HTS item numbers. In the notice, the Department stated that the conversion could be amended, as warranted, at any time
during the applicable proceeding as a result of the submission of comments or new factual information. 

As a result of comments submitted to the Department by the importing public and advice received from the U.S. Customs
Service, the Department determined that the 1989 Conversion did not accurately reflect the scope of the countervailing
duty order on Certain Textile Mill Products from Argentina and, therefore, that the conversion should be amended.


To rectify the problems in the 1989 Conversion, the Department, with the assistance of the U.S. Customs Service and
the U.S. International Trade Commission, has once again compared the TSUSA-defined scope and the HTS-defined scope
provided by the 1989 Conversion, and identified those HTS numbers that more reasonably correspond with the TSUSA-defined
scope of the countervailing duty order on Certain Textile Mill Products from Argentina. A new proposed amended conversion
is found in the attached appendix. 



Request for Public Comments 



We invite interested parties to submit comments on the proposed amended conversion within 30 days of the publication
of this notice. All comments must be in writing (10 copies), addressed to the attention of the Director, Office of Countervailing
Compliance, International Trade Administration, Central Records Unit, Room B099, 14th Street and Constitution
Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230.
