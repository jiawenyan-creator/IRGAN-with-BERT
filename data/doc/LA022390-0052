ELECTION IN NICARAGUA 
Richard Boudreaux faults Nicaragua for having "no tradition of open and honest 
elections" ("Costa Rica's Election Furnishes a Lesson in Democracy," news 
analysis, Feb. 6). But that should be blamed on the United States and its 45 
years of support for the Somoza dynasty, not on the Sandinistas. 
How many clean elections does it take to establish a tradition of electoral 
honesty? The 1984 Nicaraguan elections which I observed were a model of 
fairness and honesty. The Latin American Studies Assn. 15-member observation 
team declared the 1984 contest to be honest. So did other groups. This is a 
short tradition, admittedly, but a precedent has been set. 
Your staff writer says Daniel Ortega "rejected demands by the opposition to 
outlaw presidential succession." More exactly, it was the National Assembly. 
Boudreaux says that "while Costa Rica's revolution was fought to ensure a 
multiparty democracy, the Sandinistas came to power with the intent to stay 
there as a revolutionary 'vanguard.' " But a multiparty democracy is 
functioning in Nicaragua. Seven parties are in the government. Twenty-one 
parties are in the race now. The Sandinistas came to power with the intent to 
stay there. But that is the intention of every victorious party, anywhere in 
the world.
