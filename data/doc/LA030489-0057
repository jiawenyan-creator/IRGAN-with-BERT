SAN PASQUAL WINS FOURTH TITLE IN ROW 
San Pasqual High School overcame a tentative first half to defeat Avocado 
League rival Ramona, 1-0, Friday night at Torrey Pines High School to win its 
fourth consecutive San Diego Section girls' 2-A soccer championship. 
The only difference in the Golden Eagles' fourth title was their opponent. San 
Pasqual defeated the University of San Diego High School to win its three 
previous titles. This time it defeated Ramona for the third time this season. 
But it wasn't easy. 
"They wanted it so bad but they didn't want to make a mistake," San Pasqual 
Coach Bill Bullock said. "Four years in a row is kind of unbelievable." 
It didn't take San Pasqual long to score in the second half as Cathy Stark 
scored on at 36:37. 
Stark picked the ball up in the middle of the field and then hooked it from 
right-to-left and rolled it into the corner of the goal. 
"I just told Nikki (Gannon) to give it to me," Stark said. "I just wanted to 
put it low and in the corner. I watched to see how far the goalie would come 
out." 
Ramona had several opportunities to score in the second half as play became 
more aggressive. But the Bulldogs could not convert on any of their corner-kick 
opportunities. 
San Pasqual played much more aggressively in the second half, especially after 
Stark's goal, and was on the attack most of the half. 
"It psychs you up and it gives you a second wind," Stark said. "We were a 
little over confident in the first half, I think." 
Defense dominated the first half as neither team had any serious scoring 
threats. Ramona kept the ball in its half most of the first half, but could not 
score. 
San Pasqual did, however, have two runaway attempts that were thwarted by 
Ramona defender Genetta Johnson. 
Monica Degn had control of the ball and ran down the right side, but Johnson 
rode her out of bounds and did not give her an angle on the goal.
