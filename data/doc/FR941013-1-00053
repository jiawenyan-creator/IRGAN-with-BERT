</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Under the authority of the Clean Air Act, the EPA 
is proposing National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air 
Pollutants (NESHAP) for off-site waste and recovery 
operations. This rule would apply to owners and operators 
of facilities, with certain exceptions, that manage wastes 
or recoverable materials which have been generated off-site 
at another facility and contain specific organic chemical 
compounds listed as hazardous air pollutants (HAP). The 
NESHAP would require air emission controls be implemented 
for tanks, containers, surface impoundments, land disposal 
units, and certain other operations used to manage, convey, 
or handle wastes or recoverable materials except when the 
HAP content of a waste or recoverable material meets 
conditions specified in the rule.
