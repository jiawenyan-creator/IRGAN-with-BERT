FT  25 APR 91 / Australian pay conflict looms
AUSTRALIAN trade unions moved towards open conflict with the centralised
wage fixing system yesterday after a key committee rejected a 2.5 per cent
pay award by the Industrial Relations Commission, a national labour court.
Under Australian law, the commission has the power to prevent employers
agreeing to increase wages by more than the award unless they seek exemption
as a special case. However, the award conflicts with a separate wages
agreement between the Australian Council of Trade Unions (Actu) and the
federal Labor government, known as the Accord.
The Actu's wages committee said the award was unworkable, and said it would
ask a conference next Wednesday to approve industrial action in defence of
the Accord. If the conference agrees, the unions will campaign for payment
of the latest stage, which includes a ADollars 12 (Pounds 5.40) a week pay
rise from May 16, a 3 per cent increase in employers' pension contributions,
and provisions for further productivity negotiations at company level.
Mr Martin Ferguson, Actu president, said that 'if we as a union movement
sought to implement it (the award), it would be rejected out of hand by
Australian wage and salary earners,' he said.
The federal government also said it opposed the award, and would honour the
Accord for public sector workers and employees of government-owned
businesses, such as railways and airlines.
The response to the Industrial Relations Commission award is likely to
accelerate moves towards the replacement of the centralised labour system by
company-level collective bargaining, which has the support of government,
trade unions and employers. However, employers could face short-term
industrial unrest if the unions go ahead with a campaign for an illegal
breach of the commission's award.
