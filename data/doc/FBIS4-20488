  [Text] Thermus sp. FD3009 was transformed by 
Thermus sp. FDB8 chromosome DNA. Three transformants 
were obtained using the selecting medium of mitomycin C. These 
transformants show intermediate characteristics between the 
FD3009 and FDB8 with respect to their cell shape, clone colour, 
mitomycin C resistance and thermostable DNA polymerase activity. 
These indicate that the transformants are resulted from 
transforming FD3009 by FDB8 chromosome DNA.
