  [Text] Durban Jan 12 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] on Wednesday described a meeting between State President F 
W de Klerk and African National Congress [ANC] leader Nelson 
Mandela on Tuesday as window-dressing. "The nationalist 
government and its intelligence and security agencies seem 
fixated on the right wing and the Pan Africanist Congress, while 
they ignore far more serious violence orchestrated by the ANC 
against opponents in the black community," IFP spokesman Dr Ziba 
Jiyane said in a statement from Durban. 
  He added that any attempt to address violence without taking 
into account the ANC's role as "a primary player" or excluding 
other important players was doomed to failure. "The meeting in 
Pretoria...has no significance at all, except as glitzy window- 
dressing," said Dr Jiyane. 
  The meeting was clearly meant to create an impression of 
impartial government and ANC concern about violence, while 
sanitising one party's role in it, he concluded.
