  [Text] Chemically active polymers, particularly 
chemo-sorption fibers, are promising as a basis for immobilizing 
ions of various metals. At the same time, vigorous development 
is also taking place in the chemistry of clusters, or 
ultra-finely dispersed particles (UDCh), which have an 
extraordinary combination of electrical, magnetic, and catalytic 
properties not associated with bulkier samples of the metals. 
One way to resolve the problem of protecting UDCh is by 
surrounding them with ligands such as polymers. 
  A complex of research has been conducted on the preparation 
of cluster-containing fibrous materials based on chemo-sorption 
fibers of various chemical nature and containing acid and base 
groups. One way proposed to prepare this type of fiber includes 
stages where the metal ions are adsorbed on chemo-sorbents as a 
result of ion exchange and (or) complex formation reactions and 
subsequent reduction in a reducing solution. 
  Research made it possible to reveal several consistencies 
peculiar to processes of chemical metalization of plastics and 
chemo-sorption fibers. Using compositions for chemical 
metalization of plastics does not permit preparation of fibers 
containing a reduced metal. Because of the fact that metal ions 
are pre-fixed in the fiber, and any subsequent activity from a 
reducing solution cannot take place, the nature of formation of 
metal-containing particles in the fiber is changed. During 
chemical reduction, a multi-act process takes place between 
discrete metal ions and a reducing agent resulting in the 
formation of nascent sized particles capable of agglomeration 
into UDCh. 
  The formed UDCh have a highly developed surface which in 
many 
cases results in rapid oxidation with air oxygen during the 
washing and drying stages of the fiber (copper, iron). Moreover, 
sometimes local reduction of ions takes place along the length 
of the fiber or in the bulk of a textile fabric which may be 
explained as being due to non-uniform distribution of 
chemo-sorption groups and hence metal ions throughout the 
sample. Apparently, formation of UDCh on chemo-sorption fibers 
has limitations in metal ion concentrations within the bulk and 
on the surface of the fiber. 
  Using Vion KN-1 fiber as a chemo-sorption fiber and sodium 
dithionite as reducing agent, a nickel-containing fiber was 
prepared which has satisfactory physical-mechanical and thermal 
characteristics. An estimate of the particle sizes of the 
prepared UDCh was made. It was observed that for 8 percent (by 
weight) nickel content in the fiber, particle size varied from 
500 to 800 nm, while at 12 percent [nickel content], it varied 
from 700 to 12 nm. X-ray structural studies showed that the 
observed UDCh are not monolithic, but rather aggregates of 
smaller sized particles. 
  The electrical conductivity and magneto-electric 
characteristics of the fibers were determined. It was 
established that at 3 percent or more nickel content (by 
weight), the electrical conductivity of the fibers is constant 
and comprises 2-3 Cm. At over 8 percent metal content (by 
weight) or greater, and 8.5 GHz frequency, a marked increase in 
real and imaginary components of complex dielectric and magnetic 
permeability of the fibers is observed (_e_[.sup]'[/],

  Promising areas of application of the fibers and textile 
fabrics made from them are being considered.
