BRIEFLY 
Buyout of Unit Terminated, HCA Says: Hospital Corp. of America said it has 
terminated the planned sale of its HCA Psychiatric Co. to the unit's senior 
management and an employee stock ownership plan. Hospital Corp. said it was 
considering all alternatives concerning the unit but gave no reasons for not 
completing the deal. The Nashville, Tenn., firm, which went private in March, 
had planned to use the $1.23 billion from the sale to help pay off a 
$1.3-billion two-year loan it took out in connection with the buyout.
