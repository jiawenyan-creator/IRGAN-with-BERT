FT  15 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei slips back as
institutions take profits
INSTITUTIONAL investors looking to realise profits on their holdings took
advantage of the Nikkei average's jump on Monday, and the index closed below
the 21,000 level, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index, which closed above 21,000 for the first time in five
trading days on Monday, shed 200.32 to 20,947.79 on active selling ahead of
the mid-term settlements for tokkin, or specified money trusts and fund
trusts.
The Nikkei rose to the day's high of 21,171.72 shortly before the opening,
and fell to the day's low of 20,924.69 in the afternoon session. The market
saw support from public funds and foreign investors.
Volume totalled 300m shares, against 283m. Declines led advances by 721 to
285, with 179 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
dipped 14.18 to 1,680.33, its first fall in three trading days. In London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 0.11 to 1,287.02.
Market participants moved to adjust positions ahead of a public holiday
today. Investors also remained cautious ahead of the spate of economic
indicators announced after the market closed.
Japan's August trade surplus rose 7.5 per cent, while the first-quarter GNP
for the fiscal year to March fell 0.5 per cent. Machinery orders, however,
cast some light on the gloomy outlook, as August private sector orders rose
5.6 per cent from the previous month.
Euphoria over the government's economic support package, to be announced
tomorrow, faded as many investors now expect the package to be centred
around tax breaks for housing and education, which may not have a direct
impact on the economy.
A fall in gold bullion prices depressed metal and mining issues. Sumitomo
Metal Mining weakened Y26 to Y927 and Mitsubishi Material Y9 to Y491.
Large-capital issues, which gained ground on Monday, were lower on
profit-taking. Nippon Steel eased Y1 to Y346 and NKK Y4 to Y285, while
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries slipped Y10 to Y687.
Housing-related shares were among the gainers yesterday, on hopes of a rise
in housing demand due to the government's move to ease housing taxes. Sanwa
Shutter put on Y50 at Y1,110 and Takara Standard firmed Y20 to Y1,490.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 34.58 to 22,963.97 in volume of 57.8m shares.
Roundup
MANY OF the Pacific Rim markets were under pressure.
