  [Text] Commenting on Deputy Vice Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Koichiro Matsuura's statement that the government 
economic forecast for fiscal 1994 setting the current accounts 
surplus ratio to gross domestic product (GDP) at 2.8 percent "is 
a goal to be achieved," a government source said on the morning 
of 22 February that "within the government, there are opinions 
favoring making this a formal pledge to the United States." He 
disclosed that opinions favoring a virtual public commitment on 
setting "2.8 percent as the ratio of surplus to GDP" to effect a 
breakthrough in the serious impasse in the Japan-U.S. economic 
relations have emerged in the government. This source also 
indicated that "if asked" at the conference of finance ministers 
and central bank governors of the seven advanced nations (G-7) 
beginning on 26 February, "we may make a statement to that 
effect." 
  The government source stressed that "the economic forecast 
was officially affirmed by the government," and "2.8 percent" is 
a voluntary target that the Japanese Government will work for. 
He explained that "the surplus stands at 3.1 percent of GDP at 
present. Bringing this down to below 3 percent is `just an 
offhand idea' [tsubuyaki] on the part of Japan." 
  However, he also pointed out that "the Finance Ministry is 
opposed to" making a formal pledge to the United States. "This 
is not a problem for Japan alone. It may be greatly influenced 
by the prevailing international situation, and there may be 
circumstances beyond our control. The ministry is thus saying 
we cannot make a public commitment." He added, "Since we are 
presenting this as a government forecast, it is indeed 
considered a goal to be achieved. However, we cannot take full 
responsibility for failure to achieve the goal, because this 
will also be affected by the economic policies of the European 
countries and the United States."
