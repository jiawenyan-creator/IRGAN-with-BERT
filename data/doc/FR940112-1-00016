The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend Class E2
airspace at Oak Harbor, WA, to correct an error in the Class E2 airspace description. During the airspace reclassification
process the Class E2 airspace for Oak Harbor Airpark was miscalculated resulting in the designation of more
controlled airspace than necessary. This action would correct that error. The coordinates for this airspace docket
are based on North American Datum 83. Class E2 airspace areas are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A
dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298;
July 6, 1993). The Class E2 airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in
the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
