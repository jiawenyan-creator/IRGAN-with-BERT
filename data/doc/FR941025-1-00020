 



Pilatus Britten-Norman: 

Docket No. 94CE10AD.






Applicability: 

BN2A, BN2B, and BN2T Islander and BN2A 
Mk III Trislander series airplanes, certificated in any 
category, that are equipped with a nose wheel steering 
disconnect system with either a Modification NB/M/503 
or Modification NB/M/733 nose undercarriage unit. 



Compliance: 

Required within the next 100 hours time-in-service (TIS), unless already accomplished, and 
thereafter at intervals not to exceed 100 hours TIS. 
 
To prevent failure of the nose wheel steering 
system because of a cracked drive ring, which could 
result in the inability to move the rudder pedals, 
accomplish the following: 
 
(a) Visually inspect the nose wheel steering drive 
ring for cracks in accordance with the ACTION section 
of Pilatus Britten-Norman Service Bulletin No. BN2/SB.214, Issue 1, dated September 23, 1993. Prior to 
further flight, replace any cracked nose wheel steering 
drive ring in accordance with the applicable 
maintenance manual. 
 
(b) Special flight permits may be issued in 
accordance with 21.197 and 21.199 of the 
Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) 
to operate the airplane to a location where the 
requirements of this AD can be accomplished. 
 
(c) An alternative method of compliance or 
adjustment of the initial or repetitive compliance time 
that provides an equivalent level of safety may be 
approved by the Manager, Brussels Aircraft 
Certification Office, FAA, Europe, Africa, and Middle 
East Office, c/o American Embassy, 
B1000 Brussels, Belgium. The request should be 
forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance 
Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the 
Manager, Brussels Aircraft Certification Office.

 
 



Note: 

Information concerning the existence of 
approved alternative methods of compliance with this 
AD, if any, may be obtained from the Brussels Aircraft 
Certification Office.
