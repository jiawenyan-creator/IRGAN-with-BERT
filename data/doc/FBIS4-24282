  [Text] Ouagadougou, 24 Jun (AFP) -- The Burkinabe prime 
minister today in Ouagadougou announced the launching of a 
three-year (1994-1996) agricultural development program that 
will cost 62 billion CFA francs (Fr 620 million) and the 
introduction of a "new and more stimulating investmement code." 
  In a general policy statement before the Assembly of 
People's 
Deputies, he recalled that the "immediate effects" of the 
devaluation of the CFA franc last January have strongly 
disturbed the country's economic balances. 
  He said his goal is to reach a real growth rate of more than 
five percent a year by 1996, to limit the rise in prices of 
consumer goods, and to reduce deficits in public finances. 
  On the political plane, he announced that municipal 
elections 
would be held "in the first half" of February 1995.
