FOR THE RECORD 
Affiliations clarified -- Because of mistakes in biographical material supplied 
by KNBC Channel 4, articles in Calendar last Saturday and Monday incorrectly 
stated Dr. Bruce Hensel's affiliations with UCLA and Century City Hospital. 
Rather than a tenured professor, Hensel is an assistant clinical professor at 
the UCLA School of Medicine, an unpaid position that allows him participation 
in some areas of the teaching process. 
Hensel serves as co-director of the Century City Hospital Emergency Department, 
sharing the responsibility for overseeing the emergency ward on a part-time 
basis with two other doctors. A KNBC spokeswoman blamed the errors on the 
station's public relations department, which wrote Hensel's three-page 
biography. She said that Hensel, who has served as a medical reporter at 
Channel 4 since 1987, was hired by the station before he secured either the 
UCLA or Century City affiliations.
