FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Ford beats forecasts in third
term
FORD Motor yesterday underscored its expanding share of the recovering US
car market with third-quarter earnings of Dollars 463m, compared to a loss
of Dollars 272m in the same period of last year.
The US operations had their best third-quarter results since 1988, before
the onset of North American recession, but this was partly offset by losses
in Europe, which is in the throes of recession.
The company's earnings worked through at 79 cents a share, compared to a
loss of 66 cents, and were struck on sales and revenues which rose Dollars
1.2bn to Dollars 24.5bn.
The results, which were flattered by a change in US tax legislation worth
Dollars 140m, or 28 cents a share, were ahead of expectations and Ford
shares closed Dollars  5/8 higher at Dollars 60 1/4 on the New York Stock
Exchange.
However, analysts noted that the group's profitability was still modest,
given that its US plants were operating near capacity.
It remains less profitable than the much smaller Chrysler, which reported
third-quarter net income of Dollars 423m earlier this month. General Motors,
the largest of Detroit's Big Three car manufacturers, will report a large
loss this morning.
Ford's US automotive operations earned Dollars 333m, compared to a loss of
Dollars 260m a year ago, which the company attributed to improving industry
sales, increased market share and continuing cost reduction.
Ford's share of the US car and light truck market rose to 25.4 per cent in
the model year to the end of September, up 1.1 points from the 1992 year and
2.2 points from the 1991 year, thanks to strong-selling vehicles such as the
four-wheel drive Explorer and Taurus family car.
Profits were helped by a drop in rebates to encourage sales, which averaged
Dollars 865 a vehicle, Dollars 200 less than a year ago. Retail sales rose
18 per cent, while much less profitable fleet sales dipped 14 per cent.
Outside the US, automotive operations lost Dollars 261m, compared to a loss
of Dollars 314m a year ago, with Dollars 217m of losses in Europe more than
offsetting earnings elsewhere. Worldwide automotive operations made Dollars
72m, a Dollars 646m improvement on the year before.
The bottom line was buoyed by strong earnings from Ford's financial services
operation, which made Dollars 391m, up from Dollars 302m, thanks to
increased volume and reduced credit losses.
