  [Text] Zvornik, June 14 (TANJUG) -- Attacks on the Bosnian 
Serb republic (RS) are continuing since last Friday when a 
U.N.-brokered four-week ceasefire in Bosnia came into force. 
Bosnian Serb military sources told TANJUG on Tuesday that 
Moslem troops loyal to Alija Izetbegovic shelled Teslic (central 
Bosnia) injuring two civilians and causing considerable material 
damage. 
  The Moslems opened combined infantry and artillery fire on 
Bosnian Serb army positions southeast of Teslic. After the 
Bosnian Serb troops returned fire, the attacks stopped. In the 
region of Orasje (Bosanska Posavina), units of the local Bosnian 
Croat Defence Council (HVO) and troops of the regular Croatian 
Army carried out joint infantry and mortar attacks along the 
entire lines of separation with the Serbs. So far there are no 
reports about the effects of the Croat attacks, and Bosnian Serb 
military sources mention the destruction of civilian facilities. 
  Troops loyal to Izetbegovic continued provoking the Serbs in 
the region of Srbobran (formerly called Donji Vakuf), in central 
Bosnia, and in the area of Mts. Vlasic and Ozren. In the 
Bihac-Krupa front, in northwest Bosnia, the Moslems opened 
infantry fire. They also renewed attacks on the 
Kalinovik-Konjic fronts, northern Herzegovina. 
  According to the Bosnian Serb military sources, the Moslems 
also launched provocative actions from Gorazde, Moslem enclave 
in eastern Bosnia and a U.N. `safe area.' In Sarajevo 
Izetbegovic's troops opened sporadic infantry fire on Serb 
positions in Liljas and Hadzici. Moslem snipers shot at the 
Serb suburbs of Grbavica and Lildza.
