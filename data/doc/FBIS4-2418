  [Text] Hangzhou, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Relatives of the 24 
Taiwanese tourists who perished recently in a mainland boating 
accident left for Hong Kong with the ashes of the victims this 
morning. 
  A Chinese airliner, originally scheduled to fly directly 
from 
Shanghai to Hong Kong, made a stopover here to take on the 
relatives of the 24 victims, who died on March 31 when the boat 
they boarded burst into flames on Qiandao Lake. Also dead in 
the accident were eight mainland crew members. 
  Liu Xirong, vice-governor of Zhejiang, extended condolences 
to each of the relatives before they boarded the plane. 
  He said the mainland people shared the same feeling as the 
Taiwan compatriots. He asked them to take care and convey his 
regards to other relatives back in Taiwan. 
  Officials from other departments also saw the Taiwanese off 
at the airport. 
  The possibility of sabotage is not ruled out, according to 
sources from authoritative departments, who found suspicious 
clues in the investigation. 
  Public security departments are all out to dig up the cause 
of the accident. Results will be released to the public timely 
and in a proper way. If evidence confirms that the accident was 
staged, the culprits will be severely punished according to the 
law, said the sources.
