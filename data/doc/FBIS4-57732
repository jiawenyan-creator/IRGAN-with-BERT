  [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 May (NA) -- UCR [Radical Civic 
Union] Party President Raul Alfonsin has confirmed his rejection 
of a government project to establish a security secretariat. He 
believes this proposal "is at odds with a full state of law." 
  In a communique, the former Argentine president emphasized: 
"To establish this new government organization, it would be 
necessary to change basic laws." He asked the government "to 
maintain a responsible attitude, in keeping with our country's 
situation."
