TEACHER PAID $5,000 IN LIBEL CASE SETTLEMENT 
A former science teacher at Leuzinger High School in Lawndale, who was accused 
but never tried on charges that he had sex with a 16-year-old student, has 
accepted $5,000 to settle a libel suit against the Centinela Valley Union High 
School District and former school board member Robert Kruse. 
Charles Conn accepted the settlement last week shortly after the start of the 
libel trial against Kruse and the school district in Los Angeles Superior 
Court. 
Conn claimed he was libeled in 1983 when Kruse released a copy of a 
confidential school district memo to the Daily Breeze, which published a story 
about his alleged sexual liaison with the girl. 
Conn sued the school district and Kruse, but not the newspaper. 
Kruse, the husband of Lawndale Mayor Sarann Kruse, resigned from the school 
board in the uproar that followed publication of the story. He later was 
elected to be a trustee in the Lawndale School District. 
Conn still works for the Centinela Valley district as a biology teacher at 
Hawthorne High School.
