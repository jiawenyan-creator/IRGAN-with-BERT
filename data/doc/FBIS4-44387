  [Text] Brussels, June 29 (AFP) -- The European Court of 
Justice on Wednesday [29 June] threw out a European Union [EU] 
appeal for Greece to lift a unilateral blockade against the 
neighbouring The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), 
European Commission sources said. 
  The Court said it needed to study the case in detail, which 
could take between one and two years. The embargo was imposed 
in February.
