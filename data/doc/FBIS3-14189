<F P=106> [Report by Kamran Qurrah Daghi: "Kurds Expect Iraqi Attack </F>
'Within 48 Hours'"] 
  [Text] London -- Kurdish sources have told AL-HAYAH that 
they do not rule out an imminent attack by Baghdad on Kurdistan, 
"maybe within the coming 48 hours." 
  Meanwhile, the Kurdish administration has told Western 
states 
that Iraqi military deployments on the front lines with the 
Kurds have assumed a serious form -- which points to aggressive 
intentions. 
  The sources expressed their hope that the coalition states 
would officially warn Baghdad against any aggressive actions 
against Kurdish areas, whose inhabitants now feel the danger and 
are worried. The sources pointed out that the Iraqis have 
deployed two Republican Guard divisions on the front lines in 
Chamchamal and Karkuk. They said that Kurdish forces are 
watching the Iraqi movements and expect any potential strikes to 
focus on areas situated south of Parallel 36.
