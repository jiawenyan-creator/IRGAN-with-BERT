  [Text] Iraq has lodged a fresh protest with the United 
Nations against Iraqi airspace violations by U.S. aircraft for 
purposes of surveillance and harassment, and to drop flares. 
  A protest memorandum delivered to the UN secretary general 
by 
the Iraqi permanent representative to the United Nations 
yesterday stated that U.S. aircraft conducted 421 air sorties 
over Iraqi territory during period 21-28 February. U.S. 
aircraft flew at medium altitudes over areas in northern and 
southern Iraq, including Mosul, Irbil, Dahuk, Zakho, 
al-Nasiriyah, al-Samawah, al-'Amarah, al-Basrah, Artawi, 
al-Diwaniyah, Qal'at Salih, and al-Qusayr. 
  The memorandum noted that a hostile plane dropped three 
flares over al-Shaykhan District in Ninawa Governorate on 24 
February. On 26 February, TR-1 U.S. reconnaissance aircraft 
violated Iraqi airspace over al-Samawah, al-'Amarah, southern 
al-Diwaniyah, al-Qurnah, and al-Basrah. Then, they headed for 
Saudi Arabia. 
  Iraq requested that this memorandum be circulated as a UN 
Security Council document.
