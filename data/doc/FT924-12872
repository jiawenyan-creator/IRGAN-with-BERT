FT  19 OCT 92 / Tory MPs call for higher aid spending
WHITEHALL tension over next year's public spending allocation will deepen
today as 33 Conservative MPs call publicly for the government's overseas aid
budget to be protected from Treasury cuts.
With Cabinet ministers still in dispute over how to curb departmental
spending plans, the MPs have demanded that increases in spending in the UK
must 'not be at the expense of emergency relief or long-term development for
the world's poorest people'.
The 'EDX' cabinet committee on public spending meets again on Wednesday in a
fresh attempt to resolve how to meet the government's planning total of
Pounds 244.5bn for the 1993-94 financial year.
The overseas development budget is tipped for possible cuts while the future
of the Jubilee Line Tube extension to London's Dockland's remains in doubt.
Overseas aid, including help for eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and
help for developing coutries via the European Community, is expected to top
Pounds 2bn this financial year. An increase to more than Pounds 2.1bn was
pencilled in last autumn for 1993-94.
In an advertisement in today's Times newspaper placed by the World
Development Movement, MPs urge a real-terms increase in the overseas aid
programme countries of 3 per cent over three years. 'This autumn's spending
round will be tight. But many other parts of the world are facing a much
greater human catastrophe - Somalia, Yugoslavia, southern Africa, to name
but a few,' it says.
The advertisement has also been signed by 166 Labour MPs, 15 Liberal
Democrats and seven from other parties.
