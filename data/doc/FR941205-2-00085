</FOOTNOTE>


As the NASD indicated in its rule filing, the amendments to the Series 39 examination are designed to reflect recent
changes in the products offered in the industry and to reflect changes in the rules and regulations affecting direct
participation programs. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements
of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD, including the requirements of Section
15A(g)(3) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Section 15A(g)(3) provides, among other things, that a registered securities association may require that members
and their associated persons meet certain training, experience and competence standards. The proposed changes
to the examination will help ensure that persons seeking registration in the securities industry have attained the
requisite levels of knowledge and competence.
