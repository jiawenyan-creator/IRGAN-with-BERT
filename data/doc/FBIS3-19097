Kurdish Parliamentarians Detained in Turkey"; as released by 
Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Strasbourg, 10 Mar (BELGA) -- The European 
Parliament (EP) denounced Thursday [10 March] the arrest of 
Kurdish Parliamentarians in Turkey and asked that they be 
released immediately. 
  On 2 March, the Turkish Parliament decided to waive the 
parliamentary immunity of eight Kurdish deputies, six of whom 
belong to the Party of Democracy (DEP). Most of these deputies 
subsequently were arrested. 
  Belgian socialist deputy Marc Galle (of the Flemish 
Socialist 
Party) made an emergency trip to Turkey on 7 March in his 
capacity as chairman of the interparliamentary delegation for 
Turkey, it was learned on Thursday. Mr. Galle has the task of 
collecting information in Ankara from the Turkish president and 
Government. He must make his report next week in Brussels 
before the EP's Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security. 
  In its resolution, the Parliament denounces the "Turkish 
Government's attack on pluralist democracy" and says that the 
"only crime" of those arrested was "defending the interests of 
the Kurdish people in Turkey who are the victims of a bloody 
military repression." 
  The policy of repression and the ban on elected 
representatives expressing themselves freely "could only 
encourage the members of the Turkish minority to support the PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan]." The EP concluded by asking the 
Turkish Government "to finally recognize the right to autonomy 
of the Kurdish people in Turkey."
