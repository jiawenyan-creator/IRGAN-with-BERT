FT  13 JAN 92 / Sicilian court releases Parretti
MR Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier who is attempting to regain
control of MGM-Pathe Communications, has been released from a Sicilian jail
after 15 days and allowed to leave the country, writes Haig Simonian in
Milan.
Mr Parretti was arrested on December 27 on a string of charges involving
alleged tax fraud and illegal money transfers.
His lawyers successfully argued that he had been on bad terms with those
implicated in the alleged fraud, and could not therefore have masterminded
the operation.
