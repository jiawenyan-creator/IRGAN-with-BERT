FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: US insurer tumbles into red and
cuts dividend
CONTINENTAL Corporation, the large US property-casualty insurer whose shares
plunged in late-September because of the adverse impact of recent
catastrophe losses, yesterday reported a Dollars 142.1m deficit after tax in
the third quarter, to end-September. In the same period of 1991, Continental
made a net profit of Dollars 20.5m.
In September, Continental warned the market it would take a Dollars 120m
pre-tax charge to cover the cost of leaving both the reinsurance business
and the writing of insurance for small foreign companies. A further Dollars
200m pre-tax outlay was expected to cover losses from Hurricanes Andrew and
Iniki, plus the cost of reinstating catastrophe reinsurance.
Continental also slashed its dividend, and said it would lock in more than
Dollars 100m of realised capital gains, to help protect its capital base. On
the day of these announcements, Continental's chief operating officer, Mr
William Thiele, left the company to pursue other interests.
Yesterday's results generally reflected these moves. Continental said its
'discontinued operations' produced a loss of Dollars 156.5m, after the
Dollars 120m charge. The ongoing operations made a pre-tax profit of Dollars
20.9m, down from Dollars 42.8m a year earlier. The decrease resulted from
the hurricane-related losses and costs, with higher realised capital gains
offsetting much of the damage. The insurer's total realised capital gains in
the third quarter were Dollars 166.4m, against Dollars 32.1m in the third
quarter of 1992.
