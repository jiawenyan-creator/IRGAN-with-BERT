FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Exceptional costs leave Baltic Pounds 3m in
the red
BALTIC, the leasing and hire purchase group, incurred a loss before tax of
Pounds 2.73m for the half year to June 30. That compared with profits of
Pounds 5.62m previously.
The interim dividend is cut from 1.83p to 0.5p. The shares fell 28p to 56p.
The deficit was struck after taking account of an exceptional charge of
Pounds 5.5m to cover losses resulting from the withdrawal from construction
equipment leasing and aircraft financing.
Before exceptionals, halved profits of Pounds 2.8m mainly reflected a Pounds
2.3m charge to cover bad debts - including a Pounds 600,000 increase in
general provisions. Turnover fell to Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 22m).
Mr Harry Hyman, finance director, said: 'There is a never ending tide of
corporate insolvency. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. In fact,
things are getting worse as more and more people are experiencing financial
difficulty.'
The group withdrew from leasing construction equipment after a number of
manufacturers, which had given guarantees over the leasing of equipment,
folded. Mr Hyman said its 10 aircraft on lease had been repossessed and some
had already been sold. 'The market for aircraft leasing has fallen away', he
added.
A provision was also made for the anticipated losses arising from
manufacturing companies which had been unable to honour personal guarantees
given by their directors.
Fully diluted losses were 6.5p (earnings of 8.1p).
