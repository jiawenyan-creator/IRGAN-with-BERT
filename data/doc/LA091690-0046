DEADHEAD SCHED: Arista Records has put together a limited-edition CD package 
for the Grateful Dead's upcoming live double album, "Without a Net," which will 
include a picture CD and a special Dead poster. But the real news is that 
producer (and Dead fan) Ralph Sall, who did the recent "Guilty Pleasures" 
compilation, is putting together a collection of Dead cover songs. 
The project, which is still untitled, so far features a lineup of Elvis 
Costello (doing "Ship of Fools"), Dr. John ("Deal"), Los Lobos ("Bertha"), 
Bruce Hornsby ("Jackstraw") and Burning Spear ("Estimated Prophet"). A portion 
of the profits from the compilation, due from Arista as early as spring of 
1991, will go to the Rain Forest Action Network and other ecological-oriented 
causes. . . . And this Wednesday and Thursday are Ed Sullivan Days at Rhino 
Records. The always-irreverent store is offering $1 discounts on album 
purchases of any performers (from the Beatles to Jose Jimenez) who were 
featured on "The Ed Sullivan Show."
