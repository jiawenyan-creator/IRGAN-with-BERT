FT  18 MAY 92 / Population level poses big threat
RAPID growth in the world's population, most of it among people living in
poverty, poses one of the gravest threats to the environment. 'The result is
overgrazing, deforestation, depletion of water resources and loss of natural
habitat,' says the report.
Over the next 30 to 40 years the world's population could rise by a further
3.7bn people, from its present level of 5.3bn. In most parts of the world
this growth will come among urban dwellers. Only in Africa will more than
half the population still be living off the land.
The report makes the gloomy comment that the earlier goal of reducing the
number of poor in the world between 1985 and 2000 will now not be
achievable. At the end of this century the number of poor is now projected
to exceed 1.1bn people.
The report says four policy aims should be adopted to check these trends:
Incomes of poor households must rise.
Child mortality must decline.
Educational and employment opportunities (especially for women) must expand.
Access to family planning services must be increased.
The report says investment in female education yields some of the highest
returns for development and the environment, as better-educated mothers
raise healthier families and have fewer children.
Family planning also helps. Contraceptive use in developing countries
expanded from 40 per cent to 49 per cent over the last decade. But there is
large, unmet demand for contraceptives and their use must continue to rise
sharply to keep population growth under control.
