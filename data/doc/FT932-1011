FT  25 JUN 93 / Observer: Hic . . . haec . . . hock
One puzzling item in the annual report from water industry watchdog, Ofwat,
is a quotation from the Roman poet Horace:
Nulla placere diu nec vivere carmina possunt quae scribunter aquae
potoribus.
The scholar responsible is the chairman of the outfit's customer service
committee for Wales, Archdeacon Raymond Roberts, a former chaplain of the
fleet. He mentioned the quote to Ofwat's water-drinking director-general Ian
Byatt . . . and, lo], the report gives it a full page to itself.
The translation reads: 'No songs can please or last for long which are
written by water drinkers.'
But what does it imply? Is Byatt inciting would-be creative talents to lay
off the crystal spring and take to the hooch?
