FT  06 JAN 93 / Cross-Channel ferries hint
MOVES were announced yesterday to fill the gap created by the closure on
Monday of the Dover-Boulogne ferry service operated by P&amp;O European Ferries.
The French company Opale Ferries, which operates a freight-only service
between Boulogne and Folkestone, indicated that it was likely to add a
second ship to the route in the near future because it was close to capacity
even before P&amp;O's withdrawal.
