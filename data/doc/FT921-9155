FT  13 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Central American republics move closer to
free trade agreement
MEXICO and the five Central American republics have moved one step closer to
reaching a free trade agreement this year, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico
City. The six countries have set up a technical commission that has 60 days
to prepare a rough draft for the treaty. The treaty will be signed some time
after the commission reports, perhaps as early as May this year. Mexico
signed a free trade agreement with Chile in September last year and is
currently negotiating a free trade pact with the US and Canada, and
separately with Venezuela and Colombia.
