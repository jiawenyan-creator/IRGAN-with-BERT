VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY; 
300 TREES GIVEN TO STRAPPED SCHOOLS 
Simi Valley Unified School District officials said Monday that they have 
received a donation of 300 trees for the district's 26 campuses. 
"It's very appreciated," said Mary Beth Wolford, assistant superintendent for 
business and property management. 
Wolford said the whole community will benefit from the trees, which cost their 
donor about $15,000. 
Glen N. Gessford, president and part owner of the Big Sky Movie Ranch, said he 
decided to donate the trees to the district when he learned it had little money 
for landscaping after installing water-saving irrigation systems at several 
campuses. Gessford also supplied four workers to plant the trees, which are 
being distributed this week to schools according to need, district officials 
said. 
Gessford said he thought the trees would make the schools more attractive while 
providing a more comfortable environment for students and teachers. 
"It gives a place color," Gessford said of the trees. "It gives it a certain 
feel. This is California." 
Wolford said workers began digging holes for the trees last week and were 
planting them Monday. Wolford said white alder, silk oak, sycamore, black pine 
and California pepper are among the types of trees that were donated. 
Gessford said the trees are 3 to 5 years old and average about 15 feet in 
height, with most expected to grow to 30 to 50 feet when they reach maturity. 
"This is great," said Leslie Frank, principal of Simi School, the first school 
to have new trees. The elementary school got two white alders and three 
acacias. Frank said she hoped the donation would show parents and students how 
the community can work together to improve conditions at the schools, which 
have been hit hard by budget cuts. 
Wolford said the trees should all be planted before school starts Sept. 5.
