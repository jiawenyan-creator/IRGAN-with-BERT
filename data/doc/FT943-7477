FT  23 AUG 94 / Observer: Beering up
According to PUSH, once known simply as the Polytechnics and Universities
Students Handbook, average UK student indebtedness stands at Pounds 916 per
year, up from Pounds 614 last year.
Student debt was predictably high in London, with an average level of Pounds
1,077. But the highest level of indebtedness was in Leeds, at Pounds 1,800
per year.
In a completely unrelated finding, PUSH says the institution with the
cheapest student bar was the University of Leeds - which also happens to
have the biggest retail beer outlet in the country.
