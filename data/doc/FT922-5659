FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Varity narrows deficit to
Dollars 2.4m
VARITY Corp, the loss-making international farm equipment, automotive and
industrial machinery group, came close to breaking even in the first
quarter, thanks to a 21 per cent boost in sales, higher margins and foreign
currency gains.
The net loss narrowed to USDollars 2.4m, or 28 cents a share, in the three
months to April 30, from Dollars 37.3m, or Dollars 1.67 a share, a year
earlier. Revenues climbed to Dollars 823m from Dollars 681.5m.
The biggest improvement was at Kelsey-Hayes, the Michigan-based automotive
parts maker, whose sales climbed by almost a third to Dollars 389m, with
operating profit doubling to Dollars 31m. Higher sales of anti-lock braking
systems contributed to the increase.
Varity acquired Kelsey-Hayes less than three years ago, but automotive
products now account for 47 per cent of the parent's sales and more than
two-thirds of operating profits.
Operating income of the Perkins diesel engine group climbed by 29 per cent,
while Massey-Ferguson, the farm machinery maker, broke even, against a
Dollars 9m loss last year.
However, Pacoma, a German hydraulic systems subsidiary, remains in the red,
with a Dollars 1m first-quarter loss. Varity is rumoured to be looking for a
buyer for Pacoma.
Mr Victor Rice, chairman, predicted a continued improvement, no matter what
the economic climate.
Varity, which moved its head office last year from Toronto to Buffalo, New
York, has substantially cut its workforce in recent years as part of its
efforts to contain costs.
