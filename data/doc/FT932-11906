FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Stakis seeking to expand
STAKIS, the Glasgow-based hotel and casino group which faced a financial and
management crisis two years ago, has recovered sufficiently to begin buying
new assets, Mr David Michels, chief executive, said yesterday.
Mr Michels, who joined Stakis from Hilton UK in December 1991, said the
group was looking for hotels to add to the 30 it already owned. It also
wanted to add to its 18 casinos.
He added that Stakis, which announces half-year results in June, had cut
gearing from 79 per cent to 35 per cent. Debt had been reduced from Pounds
235m to Pounds 116m and creditor banks cut from 21 to nine.
