FT  23 JUN 92 / Arts: Today's Television
It seems you can buy a spare (working) human kidney in India for as little
as Pounds 600 and in China you can have one from an executed convict, with
the transplant operation at a military hospital thrown in, for Pounds 5,000.
BBC2's foreign affairs series Assignment (8.15) asks whether it is right to
trade in human spare parts and reports on the position in China, India, and
the US.
ITV's four-part drama Firm Friends, starring Billie Whitelaw as the
abandoned wife and Madhur Jaffrey as the Asian cleaning lady who goes into
the catering business with her, looked a little soapy in its first episode,
a quality affecting more and more television drama. Today they actually open
their restaurant (9.00).
Town Hall (9.50) is BBC2's fly-on-the-wall documentary series about Lewisham
Borough Council which began last week with an excellent episode about the
over-spent education budget. In today's episode parents and teachers take to
the streets.
ITV are following their hugely successful British Seven Up series with
programmes following children from seven years in foreign countries, tonight
Germany (10.40).
