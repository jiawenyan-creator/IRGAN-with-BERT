FT  13 MAY 92 / BP Chemicals to cut emissions
BP CHEMICALS, one of the world's largest producers of chemicals and
plastics, is to spend about Dollars 100m (Pounds 55.7m) a year on cutting
its emissions of hydrocarbons by half.
It has disclosed details of its emissions for the first time, and has
promised to reveal them annually. It has also pledged to cut by 1997 the
emission of hydrocarbons - which add to global warming - by half from 1990
levels and to cut solid emissions to water by two thirds. The move may put
pressure on other companies to follow suit. The company is committed to
spending Dollars 100m this year on its environmental programme, compared
with typical capital expenditure of Dollars 600m, and expects to spend
similar amounts in each of the next five years.
Mr Bryan Sanderson, chief executive, warned that the investment would be
reflected in higher prices to the consumer. 'The cost of being in the
chemical industry is going up,' he said. 'We have obligations to our
shareholders and our communities at our sites. This extra cost just adds
momentum to that.'
Emissions and waste generation in 1990 at the company's 10 largest sites in
Europe and the US, including five in the UK, totalled 170,000 tonnes,
equivalent to 3.2 per cent of overall production. These sites account for
only 75 per cent of output, but more than 95 per cent of all emissions.
Emissions of more harmful substances - which companies are required by law
to report - totalled 61,000 tonnes. Hydrocarbons accounted for around 45,000
tonnes.
The five UK plants at Baglan Bay and Barry, south Wales; Grangemouth on the
Firth of Forth; Hythe, Hampshire; and Hull, north Humberside; accounted for
69 per cent of the company's total emissions.
Mr Sanderson said the company's ultimate goal was to eliminate emissions.
