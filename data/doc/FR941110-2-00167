SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice contains one proposed priority under the Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind
program. Grants under this program are authorized by section 752(a) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Act), as amended.
The expenditure of grant funds under this program is governed by the regulations in 34 CFR Part 367, which were published
in the 

Federal Register

 on August 15, 1994 (59 FR 41910). 



The purpose of this program is to support projects that provide to older individuals who are blind any of the independent
living services that are described in 34 CFR 367.3(b); conduct activities that will improve or expand services for
these individuals; and conduct activities to help improve public understanding of the problems of these individuals.


This program is an important part of the National Education Goals. This programs supports the National Education
Goal that, by the year 2000, every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary
to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. 

Any designated State agency (DSA) that meets the requirements in 34 CFR 367.2 is eligible to receive an award under
this program. A DSA's application for funds under this program must contain the assurances required by 34 CFR 367.11
and any other agreements, assurances, and information that the Secretary determines to be necessary to carry out
this program. In addition, section 21 of the Act requires that projects funded under this program must demonstrate
how they will address, in whole or in part, the needs of older individuals who are blind and are from minority backgrounds.


The Secretary will announce the final priority in a notice in the 

Federal Register

. The final priority will be determined by responses to this notice, available funds, and other considerations of
the Department. Funding of particular projects depends on the availability of funds, the nature of the final priority,
and the quality of the applications received. The publication of this proposed priority does not preclude the Secretary
from proposing additional priorities, nor does it limit the Secretary to funding only this priority, subject to meeting
applicable rulemaking requirements. 






Note: 

This notice of proposed priority does not solicit applications. A notice inviting applications under this competition
will be published in the 

Federal Register

 concurrent with or following publication of the notice of final priority. 



Priority 


Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3), the Secretary proposes to give an absolute preference to applications that meet the following
priority. The Secretary proposes to fund under this competition only applications that meet this absolute priority:




Background 


The Department funded projects in 45 States in fiscal year 1994 to provide independent living services for older individuals
who are blind. The Secretary is interested in supporting projects in States that do not currently have projects funded
under this program. This priority would increase the number of States providing services to older individuals who
are blind under this program. 



Priority 


Projects must provide services to older individuals who are blind in States that do not currently have projects funded
under this program. 



Intergovernmental Review 


This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective
of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalism by relying on
processes developed by State and local governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal financial assistance.


In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide early notification of the Department's specific
plans and actions for this program.
