FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Cathay air returns hurt Swire
Pacific
SWIRE PACIFIC, the Hong Kong-based property, aviation and trading group,
reports a 17 per cent decline in first-half profit, primarily because of the
sharply reduced contribution from 51 per cent-owned airline Cathay Pacific.
The group posted profit attributable to shareholders of HKDollars 1.8bn
(USDollars 232.3m) for the six months ended June, down from HKDollars 2.18bn
in 1992.
The dividend is being held at 29 cents per A share and 5.8 cents per B
share.
Last year's interim profits were boosted by the sale of an office tower to
Hong Kong Telecom, which contributed HK630m profit.
However, Swire will book profits from the sale of its stake in the Lee
Gardens Hotel and from sales of residential units in Robinson Place during
the second half of 1993.
Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, said: 'The outlook for the aviation industry
continues to be uncertain.' But he predicted a stronger performance for the
remainder of the group's businesses.
Swire continues to expand its property investment portfolio, following the
recent HKDollars 2.85bn site purchase with Citic Pacific. Net rental income
from the existing portfolio - primarily Pacific Place and City Plaza -
increased by 29 per cent to HKDollars 1.03bn in the half-year.
Property development earnings will be strong up to 1995, due to further
contributions from Robinson Place, and from the joint venture redevelopment
of the former China Motor Bus depot.
The industrial division reported first-half growth, primarily due to strong
performances from soft drinks bottling in the US and Hong Kong, and from
Swire Technologies. But the trading division recorded a decline in earnings.
Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, the Kadoorie family company which owns the
Peninsula hotel group, posted a 12 per cent increase in net profit for the
first half of 1993 to HKDollars 178m.
