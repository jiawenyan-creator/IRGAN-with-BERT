FT  28 OCT 92 / Fifa falls foul of competition
FIFA, world soccer's governing body, and the Italian organisers of the 1990
World Cup broke EC competition rules by giving one tour operator the right
to sell World Cup package tours.
The European Commission yesterday showed Fifa and the Italian authorities
the yellow card for encouraging a monopoly in the sale of tours, but decided
not to fine them since it was the first time Brussels had formally condemned
a sporting event's ticket sales system.
However, Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, pledged to crack
down on any future infringements of Community competition law by organisers
of sporting events.
Earlier this year, the Commission persuaded the Olympic committee to change
its ticket distribution policy, allowing sought-after tickets for the
Barcelona Olympics to move freely across EC frontiers.
In the case of the World Cup, the Commission said it had been concerned only
about the monopoly over package tours. It said restrictions on general
ticket sales had been justified for security reasons.
But other tour operators had satisfied the Commission that they could easily
have offered competing package tours to the World Cup, without undermining
safety. Fifa and the Italian authorities accepted this during the
Commission's investigation.
