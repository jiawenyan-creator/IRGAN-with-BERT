FT  19 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong falls by less
than London dealers feared
PROFIT-taking following the ratification of the North American Free Trade
Agreement by the US House of Representatives eroded early Tokyo gains, but
the Nikkei average held its ground, closing marginally higher on the lack of
negative news, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index ended 57.61 up at 18,166.32 after a day's high of
18,336.63 and a low of 18,117.71. Traders said activity was largely
technical, with the futures market leading the downturn on disappointment
that the dollar did not strengthen after the passage of Nafta.
The Topix index gained a net 10.50 at 1,551.32. Volume was 220m shares,
against 216m. Many investors refrained from activity due to the afternoon
voting in the lower house over political reform. Following the parliamentary
voting, however, investors failed to react since the passage of the bill had
been expected.
Rises still led falls by 618 to 316, with 200 issues unchanged. In London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.02 to 1,251.22.
Retailers were strong on hopes of benefits from proposed deregulation
measures. Ito-Yokado jumped Y100 to Y5,590 and Seven-Eleven appreciated Y100
to Y9,150.
In spite of profit-taking by corporate investors, bank stocks remained firm
on index-linked buying. Mitsubishi Bank rose Y50 to Y3,050 and Fuji Bank put
on Y30 at Y2,280. Regional banks were actively traded. Joyo Bank, the day's
most active issue, was finally Y3 down at Y866, and Aomori Bank added Y9 at
Y640.
Honda Motor fell Y30 to Y1,470 on selling by US brokers, while Sony lost Y10
to Y4,840 after the dollar failed to rise following the Nafta vote.
Meanwhile, East Japan Railway shed Y2,000 to Y456,000 and Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone lost Y3,000 at Y778,000 on profit-taking after initial gains.
Penta Ocean Construction was hit by margin unwinding and closed Y7 cheaper
at Y553.
Daikyo, the condominium builder, forged ahead to finish Y17 up at Y893,
after losing ground on prospects of bleak full year results.
In Osaka, the passage of the political reform bill in the lower house
increased buying, and the OSE average rose 52.77 to 20,342.95 in volume of
15.7m shares. Santen Pharmaceutical advanced Y120 to Y3,180 on its forecast
of a 9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the business year to March.
Roundup
SOME markets in the region used the US congress approval of the Nafta
agreement as an excuse to take profits yesterday, following Hong Kong's
third day on the downgrade.
HONG KONG fell, but not by as much as London feared on Wednesday following
the leak that Morgan Stanley was cutting its weightings in the market.
The Hang Seng index lost 171.55, or 1.8 per cent, at 9,335.43, up from an
indicated 9,185 in London overnight. Turnover edged up from HKDollars 8.04bn
to HKDollars 8.14bn. Mr David Roche, global strategist at Morgan Stanley,
talked of 'a bubble on the Hong Kong market . . . it is not that the China
story has gone too far, it is that it has gone too fast'.
SINGAPORE rose briefly on news of Nafta's passage, but drifted lower in the
afternoon. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 10.31 down at 2,086.20,
after a day's high of 2,105.35. Volume was modest at 166.55m shares.
AUSTRALIA was disappointed by domestic corporate news, which left the All
Ordinaries index a modest 3.7 higher at 2,108.0. Turnover amounted to
ADollars 414.1m.
National Australia Bank's results came within expectations, but there was
disappointment that hopes of a scrip issue proved unfounded. The shares
ended 2 cents up at ADollars 12.88, off a day's high of ADollars 13.14.
There was less satisfaction with results from Westpac, 3 lower at ADollars
4.60.
NEW ZEALAND added to Wednesday's strong rally with a 2 per cent advance,
after the political situation was clarified. The NZSE-40 capital index moved
ahead 40.06 to 2,114.42 in turnover of NZDollars 84.5m.
Foreign buyers, in particular, were reported to have been re-entering the
market, with Telecom picking up 15 cents to NZDollars 4.30.
SEOUL registered its second 1993 high of the week, the composite stock index
ending 12.46 stronger at 822.63. However, brokers said once again that the
latest gains reflected an influx of individual investors, and that a
technical adjustment was expected next week.
BOMBAY rallied on support from foreign institutions. Mr Nigel Spence of
Lehman Brothers commented that switching of funds out of Hong Kong and into
India had been evident. Confidence had also returned to equities, he added,
following the lifting of the Srinagar seige by the army on Tuesday. The BSE
index closed 54.69 up at 2,932.31.
BANGKOK moved forward on strength in the finance sector, which helped the
SET index to a gain of 10.59 at 1,371.72. Turnover totalled Bt16.1bn.
MANILA eased as investors were seen taking profits. The composite index lost
7.13 to 2,404.18 in 1.25bn pesos turnover. PLDT fell 15 pesos to 1,790 pesos
after an overnight decline in New York trading.
