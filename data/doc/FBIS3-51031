  [Text] Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas, has announced his plans to perform 
his new responsibilities. 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] We are all aware of the 
risks that the Chiapas situation entails and of the difficulties 
in restoring conditions for coexistence based on law and justice. 
  Our main concern now is that Mexicans have died. We must 
express our condolences to all families who have lost a dear 
one, but the only way to express this to them and the rest of 
the country is with sincerity--by stopping violence. 
  Today, condemning violence is not enough; the solution is 
ahead. Whoever believes in peace must take positive actions to 
attain it. We must reconstruct the regional political process 
and seek a dignified political solution for all. We will have 
to offer, through actions, a real solution to problems. No one 
wants more deaths or terrorism. 
  The order of the actions we will undertake--considering the 
current situation and the ideas of those who are mostly 
concerned about the conflict in the region--will be: 
  1. To seek as soon as possible a truce to end the 
hostilities and restore peace in the region. 
  2. To seek by all means the initiation of a dialogue that 
will lead to peace and reconciliation, thus opening the 
possibility for Indians to return to their towns and participate 
in changes that must be promoted in the region, considering all 
sectors. I have learned through the media about reports on the 
presumed willingness from the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation 
Army] to establish conditions that can lead to a dialogue. 
Should those reports be confirmed, it would be the first signal 
that could help us find the path toward peace. [end recording]
