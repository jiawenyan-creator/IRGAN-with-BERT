FT  03 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rebounds from early fall
to set new record high
Wall Street
SHARE PRICES on Wall Street began the new year on a weaker note yesterday,
but by the close of trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen to
yet another record level. It is the market's eighth straight advance and the
fifth consecutive record high, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
Having stood over 20 points lower at mid-morning and been down by a similar
amount at mid-afternoon, the Dow advanced to 3,172.41, up a modest 3.58 on
the day.
Throughout the session, traders suggested that most of the selling pressure
came from short-term investors taking profits after the market's
post-Christmas surge.
The trend was broadly similar for other indices and markets. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended a marginal 0.17 higher at 417.26,
while the Nasdaq index of over-the-counter shares was finally 0.11 up at
586.45. Volume on the Big Board by the close stood at 207.6m shares, with
declining stocks modestly outweighing rises.
Statistics released yesterday morning sounded contradictory messages about
the state of the US economy and had relatively little effect on share
prices. The latest National Association of Purchasing Management survey was
far more gloomy than economists had predicted, suggesting that the composite
index had fallen to 46.5 per cent - the first time it has dropped below 50
per cent since May. A reading below 50 per cent indicates that the
manufacturing sector is declining.
Within the NAPM index, the employment constituent showed a particularly
marked fall. However, labour department figures suggested that initial
jobless claims fell by 29,000 to 438,000 in the week ended December 21 -
significantly better than pundits had predicted.
In the retail sector, dealers continued to pay attention to news of
Christmas sales; shares in Toys 'R' Us gained Dollars 2 to Dollars 34 3/4
after the company said eight-week same-store sales, including the Christmas
period, rose by 7.9 per cent. GTE, the telecommunications group, slipped
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 34 1/2 on news that it is selling its stake in US
Sprint to United Telecom for Dollars 530m. United Telecom was Dollars  1/8
down at Dollars 23 7/8 .
Canada
TORONTO experienced a very quiet trading session and only partially
recovered from an early setback.
The composite index, down 29 points at midsession, was finally 18.7 off at
3,493.7. Falls led rises by 290 to 204 after a volume of 11.6m shares.
Peoples Jewellers 'A' gained 60 cents to CDollars 2.35. Creditors of Zale
Corp, which is 47 per cent owned by Peoples, moved to force Zale into
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganisation in the US. Zale announced on Monday
that it will close 400 of its 2,000 stores. Mr Charles Gill, president of
Peoples, said he knew of no reason for the stock's rise.
