FT  14 NOV 94 / International Company News: Swedish medical group ahead
Gambro, the Swedish medical equipment specialist, lifted pre-tax profits by
17 per cent in the nine months to September to SKr837m, writes Christopher
Brown-Humes.
The improvement, from SKr715m, reflected an 11 per cent jump in sales to
SKr7.27bn and reduced interest costs. The group is optimistic about
prospects. In 1993 full-year profits amounted to SKr976m.
Gambro became part of Incentive, one of the most important companies in the
Wallenberg sphere, in June.
Nine-month sales grew by 9 per cent, excluding currency factors and the sale
of the group's intensive care and anaesthesia division.
Operating profits were 8 per cent higher at SKr1.05bn.
