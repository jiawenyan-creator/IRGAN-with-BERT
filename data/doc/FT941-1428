FT  25 MAR 94 / School role seen for Careers Service
Bids to provide the Careers Service would be welcome from private and state
schools, Miss Ann Widdecombe, the employment minister, said last night in a
written answer.
Miss Widdecombe said expressions of interest should be made by the end of
the month. Bids for running the Careers Service from April next year were
likely to be invited by the autumn.
Local education authorities were stripped last year of their supervisory
role for the service. The government wants a variety of local organisations
to provide the new service.
