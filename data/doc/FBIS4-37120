  [Text] Kathmandu, June 16 (AFP) -- Nepal's second largest 
parliamentary opposition party, the United Peoples Front (UPF), 
has split into two factions after a party official was expelled 
from a UPF committee, a party source said Thursday. 
  Six of the party's MPs pushed out UPF convenor Baburam 
Bhattarai from the committee he headed for using the party for 
personal gain, the source said. 
  The two new UPF factions have filed petitions to the Chief 
Election Commission Office seeking exclusive recognition for the 
next general elections in 1996.
