THE WEEK AHEAD: BEIJING; 
ASIAN DIPLOMACY 
North Korea and Japan are to hold a second round of preliminary talks Saturday 
aimed at ultimately establishing diplomatic relations between them. 
The discussions, which occur against a backdrop of political change throughout 
Northeast Asia, will take place in the Chinese capital, where both countries 
have embassies. An earlier round of talks in Beijing had left unsettled key 
questions of where, when and at what level formal talks on diplomatic ties 
should begin. 
Among other outstanding issues: North Korea's demand that Japan pay 
compensation both for the period of its colonial rule in 1910-45 and for its 
postwar "political hostility." Tokyo is balking at any compensation related to 
the postwar period.
