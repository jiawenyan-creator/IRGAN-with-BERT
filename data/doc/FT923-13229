FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: 'Value' criteria for insurance
THE USE of commercial insurance companies by government departments will
still be confined only to special cases, Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial
secretary, said yesterday.
The Treasury had come under some pressure from the insurance industry to
review its existing arrangements under which government carries the risks
for losses itself.
Justifying the decision on the grounds of value for money, Mr Dorrell said:
'Across government as a whole the cost of paying premiums can be expected to
exceed the value of claims met by insurance companies.'
