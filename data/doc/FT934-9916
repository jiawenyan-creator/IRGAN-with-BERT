FT  08 NOV 93 / Renault in Chinese minibus venture
RENAULT has announced a joint venture agreement with China's state-owned
Sanjiang Space Group to start making minibus and other versions of the
French company's Trafic light commercial vehicle from next year.
The deal, still subject to approval from the Chinese foreign trade ministry,
provides for an initial investment of Dollars 100m to upgrade Sanjiang's
existing car plant near the city of Wuhan in Hubei province.
Production of Trafic vehicles at this plant is planned to rise to 40,000 a
year by 1997, employing 2,500 people there.
From mid-1995 the joint venture, in which Renault will have a 45 per cent
stake, will also embark on production of a top-of-the-range minibus designed
specially for China.
Renault said its interest in manufacturing in China lay in the fact that the
country was one of the fastest growing markets in the world, able to absorb
an estimated 165,000 minibuses annually by the year 2000. However, it was
also one of the most protected against imports.
