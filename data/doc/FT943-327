FT  29 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
Stock index futures advanced strongly yesterday in improving volume, with
premiums to the cash market at times widening substantially.
The FT-SE 100 December contract pushed ahead steadily throughout the
session, moving up from an opening low of 3,017 to a best of the day of
3,062 by mid-afternoon.
The contract closed at 3,056, up 38 points. At this level the premium to the
cash market was 17.3, with the fair value premium around 19.
Trading volume was little better than average, reaching 13,453 contracts, up
from 10,453 on Tuesday. But dealers said there was plenty of broad based
support.
On a number of occasions the premium to the cash market widened to 24
points, the best since mid-August, as stock futures attempted to provide
cash equities with a strong lead. But at these premiums the cash market
showed a marked reluctance to follow, said dealers.
Activity was again mostly in the hands of locals. Some traders thought
institutional business could soon start to return - possibly next week  -
once third-quarter book balancing was out of the way.
Traded option turnover eased to 30,859 lots, down 3,711 on the day. FT-SE
and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for 13,759 of the total. British Gas (4,073
lots) and Hillsdown (2,955) were the most actively traded stock options.
