FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Unitech hit by slowdown in Japan
THE SLOWDOWN in the Jap-anese economy adversely affected Unitech, the
international electronics group, which suffered a 35 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits for the year to May 31.
Pre-tax profits fell from a restated Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 12m on sales of
Pounds 251.8m, down from Pounds 256.7m.
The proposed final dividend is halved to 3.75p, making a total of 5.85p,
compared with 11.7p.
Mr Peter Curry, chairman, said: 'There was a very significant fall in demand
in the second half. We had to move some of our high cost production
facilities out of Japan into Malaysia.'
This was reflected in exceptional restructuring costs of Pounds 2.13m
against Pounds 1.3m in the previous year.
Trading profit amounted to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 26.7m) before exceptional
costs.
Trading in Japan has a significant effect on the power supplies division.
Sales of Nemic-Lambda KK, its Japanese power supply subsidiary, fell by 8
per cent against a growth of 18 per cent.
Demand was flat in North America. Profit from this source fell from Pounds
19.8m to Pounds 13.5m.
The Far East is still the biggest profits source accounting for 42 per cent
compared with 32 per cent in Europe (the UK accounts for less than 10 per)
and 26 per cent in North America.
Mr Curry said all the company's markets outside Japan appeared to be static
or showing signs of slight improvement.
An extraordinary gain of Pounds 4m related to the sale of Rathdown
Industries, a manufacturer of pay phones. This helped reduce net debt from
Pounds 54.5m to Pounds 40.9m and gearing from 61 per cent to 43 per cent of
net assets. Earnings fell to 7.3p (11.5p).
COMMENT
The dividend cut reflects the group's difficulty in being a UK-based group
with an international business. An increasing percentage of the profits is
earned outside the UK and given that this trend is set to continue,
additional tax outlays could be incurred from unrecovered advanced
corporation tax without a cut in the dividend. The high tax rate of 44.3 per
cent, due to the Japanese businesses, has to be set against a strong balance
sheet coupled with a mix of businesses ready to benefit from any worldwide
economic recovery. With forecasts of pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.4m, giving
earnings per share of 8.3p, the shares - which rose 6p to close at 144p -
are on a prospective multiple of 17.3. The premium rating is probably fair
since either the Swiss group Electrowatt or the Italian lawyer Tito
Tettamanti, who between them own just over half the company, may make a bid.
