FT  29 MAY 93 / Lamont returns to backbench beat
ON HIS first day back on the beat as an ordinary backbench MP, Mr Norman
Lamont was at pains to show that it was business as usual at his Kingston
upon Thames constituency in south-west London.
People who visited him on constituency concerns had varying views of how the
former chancellor was facing up to his loss of office.
Mr Jan Korff said he looked 'fine' and fairly relaxed, but Mr Laurie Fedder
said he seemed downbeat.
'He was looking pretty grim,' said Mr Fedder, who said that when he had made
the appointment three or four weeks ago he had been intending to see the
chancellor of the exchequer.
Mr Lamont drove to his weekly surgery at the local Conservative party
headquarters in a grey Vauxhall Cavalier. As he arrived, he showed little
sign of the strain of the previous days. Mr Ron Gill, chairman of the
Kingston and Malden Conservative Association, said the local constituency
party would be glad to see more of him.
Mr Adam Burt, a friend and former political agent for Mr Lamont, said after
meeting him that he 'looked relaxed and very happy. He did not look tense.
He did not appear bitter at all.'
Mr Burt added that he thought the events of the last few days were
'disgraceful'. He added: 'Mr Lamont said he would like to stay in politics.'
Mr Lamont told the Grimsby Evening Telegraph yesterday that he expected to
take about a week to move out of 11 Downing Street, writes Ralph Atkins.
Choosing his mother's local paper, rather than the national press, for his
first post-resignation comments, Mr Lamont said he hoped to visit Grimsby
soon. He refused to discuss the row over his resignation.
