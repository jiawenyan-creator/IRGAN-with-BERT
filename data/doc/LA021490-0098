BRIEFLY 
52-Week T-Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury Department sold $9.6 billion of the 
bills at an average discount rate of 7.42%, up from 7.21% at the last auction 
on Jan. 11. The rates were the highest since Sept. 21, 1989, when the one-year 
bills sold for 7.61%. The new discount rate understates the actual return to 
investors -- 7.97% with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,249.80.
