FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Thorntons surges 36% to Pounds 9.6m
Thorntons, the chocolate maker and retailer that has reorganised its
lossmaking French businesses, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.58m for
the 28 weeks ended January 8.
'This is well above anything else we have reported before', said Mr John
Thornton, chairman and chief executive, yesterday.
The 36 per cent rise from a previous Pounds 7.02m reflected the benefits
from last year's French reorganisation, which helped push the group Pounds
4.8m into the red at the year-end.
Mr Thornton said the rationalisation was almost complete. The French
business would be concentrated on 20 shops in Paris, with 20 outlets being
closed.
At the operating level the loss from French operations was cut to Pounds
93,000 for the half, compared with Pounds 846,000 last time. 'We are very
confident about the future', said Mr Thornton.
Total group turnover from continuing operations rose by almost 10 per cent
from Pounds 51.4m to Pounds 56.4m, not including Pounds 2.27m (Pounds 2.95m)
from discontinued operations.
In the UK sales were boosted by a strong Christmas period, which accounts
for 30 per cent of annual turnover. Like-for-like sales in Thorntons own
shops were 4.1 per cent ahead.
Total UK sales, which include turnover from franchise outlets, chilled
cabinets and 'own label' sales to multiples, rose by 10.5 per cent to Pounds
54.2m.
The group opened 46 new outlets in the period, comprising 10 Thorntons
shops, one franchise and 35 chilled cabinets sited in other shops.
Mr Thornton said the group had made general gains in the efficiency of its
distribution system, cutting waste. Overall capital expenditure was Pounds
5m, down from Pounds 8.5m.
Earnings per share rose from 7.38p to 9.82p. The interim dividend has been
raised to 1.45p (1.25p).
