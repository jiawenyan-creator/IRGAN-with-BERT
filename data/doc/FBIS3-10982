  [Text] The Group of Latin American and Caribbean countries, 
Grolacc, on 14 March, expressed to the UN Security Council its 
opposition to a resolution bill that would impose a total trade 
embargo on Haiti until democracy returns to the country. 
According to diplomatic sources, Grolacc's position received the 
support of several members of the Council, notably Spain, 
Nigeria, and Djibouti. 
  In a new attempt to harmonize the efforts of the 
international community, mediator Dante Caputo invited 
representatives of the four countries, the so-called Friends of 
Haiti -- the United States, Canada, France, and Venezuela -- to 
hold a high-level meeting on the Haitian question in New York on 
17 or 18 March.
