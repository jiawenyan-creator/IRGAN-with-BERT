  [Text] Skopje, 20 Jun (TANJUG) -- Eftim Ancev, minister of 
agriculture, forestry, and water management for Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --FYROM], speaking on his 
return from a three-day visit to Turkey, told journalists here 
that an aid package for about 10,000 tonnes of corn for 
Macedonia had been agreed. 
  "We held useful talks with Turkish Agriculture Minister 
Sahin 
and we signed a protocol on technical and scientific cooperation 
in the sphere of agriculture," Ancev said, and added that they 
had also discussed the possibilities of exchanging experts." 
  The aid agreement on 5-10,000 metric tons of corn and on the 
purchase of a certain amount under very favorable conditions at 
good prices is very important, he said. 
  The Macedonian minister also stressed the importance of the 
fact that in the future Macedonia will be able to export its 
goods to the Turkish market, "and to buy Turkey's products for 
very good prices and under good conditions."
