METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS LOBBY FOR UC CAMPUSES 
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday asked University of 
California officials to consider building campuses in Diamond Bar and the 
Antelope Valley. 
"Diamond Bar would seem to be a logical area for this new Southern California 
campus, inasmuch as it is physically located at the mid-point between the three 
existing UC campuses in the Los Angeles Basin," said Supervisor Pete Schabarum, 
whose district includes Diamond Bar. 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich persuaded the board to expand its request to include 
the fast-growing Antelope Valley, which is part of his district. 
No specific sites have been proposed in either area. 
The UC Board of Regents earlier this year began planning for three additional 
campuses and indicated that it would probably build one in Northern California, 
one in the Central Valley and one in Southern California.
