  [Text] Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, cochairmen of 
the Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, arrived in Sarajevo 
today. They held talks with President Izetbegovic and Prime 
Minister Silajdzic in the presidency building. 
  Addressing correspondents after the talks, President 
Izetbegovic said the main topics touched upon were Gorazde, 
Sarajevo, Mostar, the possibilities for a cease-fire, and the 
continuation of the peace process. We presented our well-known 
stands, President Izetbegovic said. This implies the withdrawal 
of the (?enemy) forces to the positions held before 30 March. 
Only then could we return to the negotiating table. We accept 
the cessation of all military activities for a limited period of 
time. This would create conditions for the continuation of 
negotiations, President Izetbegovic said. 
  Lord Owen told correspondents that most of the time was 
spent 
discussing Gorazde. He also stressed that he was interested in 
changes in Sarajevo, where there is no more shelling. However, 
this is still a closed city, Lord Owen stressed. We are going 
to Pale from here. We will try to find more understanding there 
for the issues that we are discussing. We are here to try to 
put the peace process on the right track, Lord Owen said at end 
of the news conference.
