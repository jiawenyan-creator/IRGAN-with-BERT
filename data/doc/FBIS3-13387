  [Text] Following Washington's wariness and doubts about a 
statement by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in Tunis on 
'Arafat's readiness to resume negotiations, a telephone 
conversation between Yasir 'Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher reaffirmed that the issue is still 
deadlocked. The Palestinian News Agency, WAFA, said that, in 
his telephone contact, Christopher emphasized the importance of 
the peace process and the need to resume the negotiations. WAFA 
adds that while 'Arafat reiterated the PLO commitment to the 
peace process and the negotiations, he also stressed the 
importance of taking measures to protect the Palestinian people 
and their Muslim and Christian holy places, to provide 
international protection, and to take measures against the armed 
settlers who are threatening the peace process with their daily 
crimes. 
  In a commentary, the WAFA political editor said that nothing 
good will result without guarantees for the security of the 
Palestinians. He said the negotiations will become dangerous, 
reckless, and absent of any prospects, as he put it. 
  No Palestinian stand has yet been voiced on the possibility 
of a U.S. veto during a vote on the resolution about the Hebron 
massacre if differences between the two sides persist. However, 
it seems that so far the Palestinian leadership is prepared to 
face this possibility rather than return to negotiations that 
would not serve its dignity or secure a minimum of its demands.
