  [Text] Cape Town March 31 SAPA -- The Democratic Party [DP] 
on Thursday [31 March] conditionally supported the imposition by 
President F W de Klerk of a state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal, 
stressing that normal political activity should continue 
unhindered and human rights defended as far as possible. 
  In a statement, DP Natal leader Roger Burrows said the 
emergency regulations should make specific reference to the 
human rights situation of likely detainees and indemnity for 
acts committed by security forces during the state of emergency 
should be specific and limited in extent. 
  Mr Burrows said the DP awaited the specific gazetted 
regulations before reacting further. 
  The DP had always been opposed to the imposition of a state 
of emergency, but was giving its conditional support to the 
present one in view of the extremely grave situation in 
kwaZulu/Natal. 
  The support was dependent on the emergency being aimed only 
at the cessation and prevention of violence and the promotion of 
free political activity in kwaZulu/Natal. 
  Normal political activity had to continue unhindered, Mr 
Burrows said.
