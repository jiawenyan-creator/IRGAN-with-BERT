FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Electricity distributors in trading link
East Midlands Electricity and Yorkshire Electricity, two electricity
distributors with adjoining markets, are to merge their retailing and
appliance servicing operations.
The new company, a further sign of consolidation in the electrical business,
will be equally owned by the two distributors, and will have turnover of
more than Pounds 125m.
It will operate as an independent company based in Normanton, West
Yorkshire, with Mr Martin Watts as managing director. The site belongs to
Yorkshire and East Midlands will make an undisclosed compensating payment.
Mr John Harris, chairman and chief executive of East Midlands, said the
merger would yield significant economies of scale with increased
distribution efficiency and the centralisation of head offices.
