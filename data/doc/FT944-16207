FT  14 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: University research - for or against
an elitist approach NY
Sir, Your leader, 'University reform' (October 11), accurately summarised
some of the problems afflicting higher education in the UK. Your proposal to
limit access to research funds to a small group of universities, say 20, is
certainly a way of facilitating an improvement in research quality.
The present system of allocating funds, a much distorted bureaucratic
structure, is encouraging too many universities to compete for a slice of
the limited research budget. In March 1996, departments within UK
universities will be assessed on their research record and this will be a
critical factor determining departmental incomes for several years
thereafter. A consequence of this assessment structure is the dispersal
across universities of staff with good publication records, as low or
non-research rated departments attempt to improve research standings.
While it may seem an appealing strategy to have more facilities undertaking
research, it is leading to a dilution of research resources. To take a
football analogy, it is a bit like distributing some of the star players in
the top teams of the premier division across teams in the lower divisions.
Such a strategy would clearly redress imbalances across the teams, but the
overall quality of matches would undoubtedly suffer. Fortunately, the market
in football prevents this from happening.
The problems besetting British universities are being exacerbated by the
dilution of gifted researchers across a wider base. The resurgence in
English league football has been achieved by adopting an overtly elitist
strategy. It is about time policymakers recognised that gains in research
excellence in British universities can be achieved similarly.
