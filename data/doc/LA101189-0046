WORLD IN BRIEF; 
BRITAIN; 
CONSERVATIVES OPEN TALKS UNDER CLOUD 
The Conservative Party of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, whose ratings have 
plummeted in opinion polls, opened its annual conference in the northern 
English resort of Blackpool. With Britain's grim economic situation dominating 
the meeting, party officials defended their beleaguered finance minister, Nigel 
Lawson. Party Chairman Kenneth Baker opened the session by supporting Lawson 
and sought to boost morale with a fierce attack on the opposition Labor Party. 
Lawson's popularity tumbled when he decided to follow the lead of West 
Germany's Bundesbank and raised interest rates.
