FT  06 JUL 92 / Belgian defence cuts prompt Nato protest
NATO and the Belgian chief of staff have made highly unusual appeals to the
government over its plans for huge defence cuts which include an end to
conscription, according to a television report, Reuters reports from
Brussels.
Belgium's centre-left government said on Friday it would end military
conscription by 1994, which will roughly halve the 86,000-strong armed
forces. Defence spending would also stay below current levels for at least
five years.
BRT television reported on Saturday that the country's chief of staff,
General Jose Charlier, had written to the government complaining that the
plan was unworkable and that it would be impossible to maintain Nato
commitments.
It also said Nato secretary-general Manfred Worner had asked Belgian Prime
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene to reconsider the plans. There was no comment from
Nato.
