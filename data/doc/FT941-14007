FT  22 JAN 94 / Sharp increase in written-off tax
The rise in business insolvencies between 1989 and 1992 led to a sharp
increase in the amount of tax that was written off by the Inland Revenue.
In a Commons written answer, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the
Treasury, said Pounds 1.69bn in tax was written off in 1992 - nearly three
times the amount written off in 1990.
The Inland Revenue attributed the increase to bankruptcies and to changes in
the way that insolvency was administered in those years.
