FT  18 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Finmeccanica - Other companies
The Italian state-controlled engineering and defence group today launches
what amounts to a partial privatisation of the company, through a L1,700bn
(Dollars 1.1bn) rights issue. The issue - priced at L2,100 a share - will
reduce the stake of IRI, the state holding company, from 85 per cent to less
than 60 per cent. The proceeds will be used to reduce debts and help pay for
the acquisition of formerly state-owned defence interests.
