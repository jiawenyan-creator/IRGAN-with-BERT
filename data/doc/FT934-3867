FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Friends Provident pays Pounds 115m for NM
Financial Management
Friends Provident, one of the UK's largest mutual life assurance and
investment management organisations, has moved to widen its distribution
capacity by buying the NM Financial Management Group for Pounds 115m.
NM was sold by the National Mutual Life Association of Australia, which
intends to focus its development in Asian and Australasian markets where it
is a more significant force than it has been in the UK.
The purchase of NM's life, pensions and unit trusts businesses will add over
Pounds 2bn to Friends Provident's Pounds 10bn of assets under management. It
will also involve the transfer of 350,000 policies and 250,000 clients to
Friends Provident's customer base of about 2m policies and 1.5m clients.
Mr Michael Doerr, the managing director of Friends Provident who will become
chairman of NM, said yesterday that while he expected some short-term
benefits as the two organisations came together, the main purpose of the
move was to broaden the customer base in order to cut unit costs.
Some 200 to 250 of NM's 300-plus self-employed sales agents are expected to
join the 400 existing employed Friends Provident sales force.
Mr Roman Cizdyn, life assurance analyst with Smith New Court, said that the
move made sense for both parties: smaller offices such as NM were facing
increasing expenses to meet compliance costs, while Friends Provident had to
take account of the breaking of its link with the Abbey National in
February.
Friends Provident is also buying NM's life and pensions company in the
Republic of Ireland.
