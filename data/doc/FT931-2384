FT  20 MAR 93 / S Korea to boost growth
MR Kim Young-sam, South Korea's new president, yesterday announced a
'100-day programme for a new economy', intended to stimulate the economy and
remove bureaucratic controls on business.
The move comes amid indications the administration will adopt a gradual
approach towards financial liberalisation to avoid disrupting economic
recovery.
Mr Kim promised that central bank lending rates would be cut and the money
supply eased to boost economic growth, which amounted to 4.5 per cent last
year, the lowest rate in 11 years.
The finance ministry said this week economic growth was expected to fall
below the target level of 5 to 6 per cent during the first half of 1993.
Reducing interest rates represents an abandonment of the tight monetary
policy the government pursued last year to cool the overheated economy.
Inflation should be controlled instead through a voluntary restraint on
prices and wages, said Mr Kim, who suggested he might impose a mandatory
freeze.
The government has delayed plans to deregulate most commercial interest
rates until at least later in the year because of fears that this might
drive interest rates higher.
It has also postponed introducing a requirement to use real names in
financial transactions. Financial accounts can now be held under pseudonyms
and are used to hide money generated from the large underground economy.
Other proposals in the economic programme include support to small
businesses, which suffered record bankruptcies last year. State assistance
for technological research and development will be increased, while many
administrative restrictions hampering business operations will be abolished.
