NORTH TORRANCE AT CULVER CITY 
Culver City (4-0 overall) continues to roll, and wide receiver-defensive back 
Greg Hooks provided much of the momentum last week as the Centaurs opened their 
Ocean League schedule by swamping Centennial, 44-0. 
Hooks scored in nearly every way imaginable: on interception returns of 45 and 
34 yards, a 77-yard punt return and on a 47-yard reception of a Troy Dunlap 
pass. Dunlap completed nine of 13 passes for 161 yards and also threw a 37-yard 
touchdown pass to tailback John Haqq. Haqq carried 18 times for 118 yards and a 
23-yard touchdown, and in four games he has rushed for 679 yards and has 
accounted for 751 all-purpose yards. 
North Torrance (1-3, 1-0) came from behind to edge Morningside, 8-7, in a 
league opener last week. The winning drive was mounted on the ground rather 
than in the air, the usual strength of the Saxons. Last summer North won the 
Los Angeles Games passing championship behind all-league quarterback Brian 
Jurado and wide receiver Eric Jensen. 
The Centaurs will play host to North Torrance at 7:30 p.m. Friday. 
Palos Verdes at Santa Monica 
With starting running backs Mark Harper and Mike North sidelined with injuries, 
Santa Monica (3-0 overall) was fortunate to defeat Torrance, 20-15, in a Bay 
League opener. 
The Tartars got out to a 15-0 lead before quarterback John Aylsworth spurred 
Santa Monica to victory. Aylsworth hit on 12 of 26 passes for 147 yards and two 
touchdowns and scored the winning touchdown on a six-yard run. 
The Vikings will entertain Palos Verdes (3-1, 0-1) at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Santa 
Monica College. The Sea Kings won their first three games, but unbeaten 
Hawthorne shut them out, 20-0, in a league opener. 
Hamilton at Venice 
Hamilton (1-1 overall) and top running back Jay Fields couldn't dent the 
Granada Hills defense last week. Fields was held to 53 yards on 14 carries, and 
the Highlanders routed the Yankees, 43-6. 
Venice (3-0) held Monroe to 123 yards rushing and didn't allow a pass 
completion in its 27-6 victory last week. 
On offense against Monroe, Venice was led by junior tailback Mark Walker and 
quarterback Louis Jones. Walker rushed for 135 yards on 14 carries and scored 
on a 26-yard run. Jones, a wide receiver on offense last year, had eight 
completions in 10 attempts for 65 yards and one touchdown and also scored on a 
seven-yard run. 
Both teams may pass more often than usual in this Coastal Conference opener at 
8 p.m. Friday at Venice. Jones is improving in his new role as a passer, and 
Hamilton scored its only touchdown on a nine-yard pass from Courtney Curry to 
Matt Smith. 
Manual Arts at Westchester 
Westchester (2-1 overall) moved out to a 19-0 lead, held El Camino Real to 88 
yards in total offense and coasted to a 27-7 victory last week. 
The Comets, who will play host to Manual Arts (0-3) in a Coastal Conference 
opener at 8 p.m. Friday, scored on the first play from scrimmage against the 
Conquistadores. 
In the El Camino game, Brad Freeman began by throwing a 63-yard touchdown pass 
to Nathaniel Bradley. On his second pass attempt, Freeman connected with Darren 
Johnson on a 65-yard screen hat set up the Comets's second touchdown, a 17-yard 
run by Tim Holliday. Johnson returned a fumble 45 yards for another touchdown. 
El Camino held star tailback Holliday to 21 yards, but running back Walter 
Grissam came through with 73 yards on 17 carries and scored on a four-yard run.
