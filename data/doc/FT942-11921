FT  03 MAY 94 / White House pushes gun control
The Clinton administration has begun an all-out drive to win support for a
ban on assault weapons and large-magazine guns, but still faces possible
defeat when the measure comes to a vote in the House of Representatives
later this week.
White House officials acknowledge they are still around 15 votes short in
the House, despite the support of Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois, a
senior Republican who has in the past opposed similar bans but who voted for
the measure in committee last week. The proposed law closely resembles a
measure included last year by the Senate in a much broader crime bill, and
would outlaw 19 specific weapons, as well as high capacity magazines.
It would also impose a more general ban on semi-automatic weapons which have
additional features such as flash suppressors, but would specifically exempt
over 600 types of gun considered to have a legitimate sporting purpose.
But Congressman Jack Brooks, a Texas Democrat who is chairman of the House
judiciary committee, opposes the ban and kept it out of the House's broad
crime bill, hoping that if it is defeated on its own on the floor of the
House he will have more leverage to resist it as the House and Senate try to
reconcile their versions of the crime bill.
Senior administration officials have tried to tackle the National Rifle
Association, the potent gun lobbying group which opposes the measure, by
mobilising police officers and hunters to argue for it.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, pointed out that the bill seeks to
restrict magazines that hold as many as 90 rounds, while federal law
restricts hunting for migratory birds to guns with no more than three
shells.
'Now, why should we have laws that protect ducks more than human beings?' Mr
Bentsen asked.
