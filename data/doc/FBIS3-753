<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Bophuthatswana President Lucas </F>
Mangope by SABC correspondent Danie Hefers on 12 March; place 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope says he is 
still in control of his country. In an exclusive interview with 
TV news reporter Danie Hefers this afternoon, he blamed his 
opponents for the violence in Bophuthatswana. He also denied 
rumors that he was in hiding. President Mangope told Danie 
Hefers that a final decision on participating in the election 
stil had to be made. 
  [Mangope] I want to emphasize that it will be Parliament in 
its wisdom that will decide whether to take part in these 
elections or not, and Parliament will have also, of course, to 
decide on what are the logical consequences of a decision to 
take part in those elections. 
  [Hefers] Do you still see a future for the Freedom Alliance 
after all that's happened now? 
  [Mangope] I think because of what has happened the Freedom 
Alliance should be even stronger, because I think we are 
fighting forces, for want of a better description, forces that 
are there really to bring about anarchy, to intimidate, to bring 
the true character of communism, to make the future bleak for 
everybody. 
  [Hefers] Mr. President, a lot of damage have been caused by 
the violence this past week. Who's going to pay for all this? 
  [Mangope] I think the price is going to be high. There's no 
doubt about that. I think my people are going to suffer as a 
result of what has happened. Now you say: Who is going to pay 
for this? I think the children of my people are going to pay 
for this, in that schools have been burned down, in that 
shopping facilities have been burned down, in that facilities 
that are scarce, facilities that we don't readily find in 
Africa, have been destroyed. And I say to the shame of the 
African National Congress [ANC], their leaders, the Communist 
Party, and even, as I said, the Nationalist Party, my people are 
going to suffer -- that unfortunately it will be too late, it 
will be too late unfortunately. But there is no doubt that they 
are going to suffer. 
  [Hefers] Mr. President, I've been in the country since 
Monday; I've been through all the violence. I've spoken to 
people. I heard people shouting, asking for your head. Is 
there blood on your hands after all the violence this past week? 
  [Mangope] I have no feelings of animosity to anybody, but I 
want also to emphasize that I have no fear, whatsoever. I know 
that what I have done has been right, I have said to my people, 
I have slaved for them, I have established here sites of 
developments, that is not readily come by, as I say, in most 
African countries. I have no regret for what I've done.
