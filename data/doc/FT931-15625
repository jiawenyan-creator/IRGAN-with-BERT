FT  12 JAN 93 / People: Inchcape loses family ties
The retirement of Lord Tanlaw, 58, as a non-executive director of Inchcape,
means that the direct ties between the company and the family of James Lyle
Mackay, the first Lord Inchcape, have been almost completely severed.
Lord Tanlaw, the current Lord Inchcape's half-brother, joined the family
firm the year after its shares were quoted on the London stock market. After
six years in Calcutta and the Indian subcontinent, Simon Tanlaw was
appointed a director in 1966.
He became a non-executive director in 1971 after he was elevated to the
peerage. During his time at Inchcape he was involved in the group's merger
with the Borneo Company, which took it into vehicle distribution (now
Inchcape's biggest business) and also the creation of the Gray Dawes Bank.
Lord Tanlaw has decided to retire in order to devote more time to the
development of Fandstan Electric - his own group of railway engineering
companies. The current Lord Inchcape, 75, who headed the company between
1958 and 1982, remains life president but no longer has a seat on the board.
