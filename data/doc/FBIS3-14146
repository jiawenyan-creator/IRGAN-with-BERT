<F P=106> [Studio talk between anchorman Hayim Yavin and political </F>
correspondent Gadi Sukenik] 
  [Text] [Yavin] We now return to the political process. 
Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik is in the studio. The 
consultations between the prime minister and the delegation 
which returned today from Tunis are continuing. Is there any 
chance of either a summit meeting or the resumption of the 
talks? Are there any new decisions, Gadi? 
  [Sukenik] Yes. The consultations are still under way here 
and in Tunis but the picture that is forming appears to be quite 
positive. Rabin received an optimistic briefing from the 
members of the Israeli delegation. Here are the facts: Rabin 
apparently agrees to an international presence in Hebron as 
demanded by the Palestinians, as well as to the immediate 
deployment of a Palestinian police force. The quantities, 
weapons, and all the other details still have to be worked out 
tomorrow in Cairo. Rabin definitely rejects an armed UN 
presence in Hebron and insists that everything remain under 
Israeli control. 
  The delegation, composed of the same members -- Deputy Chief 
of Staff Amnon Shahaq, Foreign Ministry Director General Uri 
Savir, Prime Minister Rabin's adviser Jacques Neriya, and legal 
adviser Yo'el Zinger -- will leave tomorrow afternoon for Cairo. 
Most importantly, the Norwegians are at this very moment 
sending out invitations to a conference scheduled to take place 
in Cairo on 24 March for all the countries that are supposed to 
be contributing to the autonomy institutions. If everything 
goes smoothly and rapid progress is made in the discussions, PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat will attend this conference and Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres will also most likely show up. The two 
men will hold a summit meeting and then practical negotiations 
on the implemention of the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho will resume at the 
beginning of next week. 
  [Yavin] Thank you, Gadi Sukenik.
