CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
RANDSBURG; 
BOY PULLED FROM MUD TRAP IN DESERT 
An 11-year-old Rancho Palos Verdes boy buried up to his neck in a 
quicksand-like muck near Koehn Dry Lake was rescued in good condition after a 
four-hour desert ordeal. Firefighters were called in Thursday afternoon after 
it was determined the thick mud's suction prevented John Connett from working 
himself free. The boy was then taken by helicopter to Antelope Valley Hospital 
and Medical Center in Palmdale, where he was treated for exposure and released. 
Connett and his father had been riding on three-wheel off-road vehicles when 
the boy became stuck up to his kneecaps in the muck in the lake bed area 20 
miles north of California City. By the time his father returned with help, the 
boy was up to his neck.
