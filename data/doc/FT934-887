FT  22 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Borden
Every investment banker on Wall Street seems to have crunched the numbers on
how to break up Borden's disintegrating food and chemical empire. That no
bid has yet emerged suggests how difficult it is to make the sums stack up.
As an unwieldy conglomerate attempting to rationalise too late, Borden has
been left with too many products commanding small market shares. Some of
Borden's foods businesses have been eaten alive by focused competitors.
Anheuser-Busch and the revitalised Frito-Lay have bitten great chunks out of
Borden's market share in salty snacks.
Borden retains more attractive businesses in spaghetti sauces, ice-cream and
pasta, which could appeal to Campbell, Unilever or Nestle. But it would be a
bold move for one predator to risk buying a company with such poor cash
flow, weak brands and tricky disposal prospects. Similar worries, though,
did not stop Tomkins buying Ranks Hovis McDougall.
The more likely outcome is that Borden will slowly shrink by selling off its
assets piecemeal. That, though, will only compound the cash flow constraints
of its remaining businesses. The worry for food industry rivals would be if
Borden's capacity was recycled in another form at lower cost. Other US
industries as diverse as paper and airlines have seen their economics
wrecked as excess capacity has been kept alive. Branded foods are more
defensible. Nonetheless, such a development would turn up the heat another
notch.
