FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bank of Tokyo will upgrade
Taiwan office to branch
AFTER months of negotiations with Beijing, the Bank of Tokyo, the Japanese
foreign exchange bank, yesterday announced that its representative office in
Taipei would be upgraded to branch status.
This follows a painstaking approval process by the Chinese government, which
is sensitive about dealings with Taiwan. The Bank of Tokyo has been wary of
irritating the Chinese government, which punished the bank in 1990 when it
announced plans to open a Taipei representative office by delaying a planned
financial joint venture in Shanghai and suggesting other opportunities in
the mainland market would be denied.
Beijing later forgave the bank but Japanese financial institutions have
since been discreet in dealings with Taiwanese authorities. Bank of Tokyo's
Taipei branch plans to start banking and foreign ex-change operations on
March 27.
