FT  06 SEP 93 / International Company News: Sime Darby increases earnings by
11%
SIME DARBY, the Malaysia-based conglomerate which claims to be south-east
Asia's biggest multinational, has announced pre-tax profits of MDollars
840.8m (USDollars 331m) for the year to June 30 1993.
The figure represents an 11 per cent rise over the previous year and more
than four times Sime Darby's 1987 profits.
Group turnover was MDollars 7bn, a 14 per cent rise over last year. A final
gross dividend of 16.5 Malaysian cents has been recommended, compared with
14.5 cents last year.
Sime Darby, once largely plantation based, is now involved in a wide range
of activities including the manufacture of rubber products, the oil and gas
industry, property and motor and heavy equipment franchises.
Sime's biggest cash earner was once again its operations in Hong Kong, where
it is the main automotive and heavy equipment distributor. Pre-tax profits
from Hong Kong were up 33 per cent to MDollars 195m compared with MDollars
142m last year.
'This remarkable achievement is the result of a booming economy in southern
China and has taken place in spite of the fact that the future of the new
Hong Kong airport and the Legislative Council elections remain unresolved,'
said the group.
A cutback in logging led to a decline in earnings from the group's heavy
equipment business in Malaysia, but revenues from the group's substantial
involvement in the local oil and gas industry made a significant
contribution to overall profits.
The plantations division benefited from continuing strong prices for palm
oil, though sagging rubber prices resulted in lower production and affected
overall plantations performance.
Mr Nik Mohamed Yaacob, the new group chief executive, said that in the short
term Sime's main priority was to turn round its insurance business, which
continues to make a loss.
