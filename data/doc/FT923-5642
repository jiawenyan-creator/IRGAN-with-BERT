FT  29 AUG 92 / Inventors offer oven-ready nappies
A NAPPY designed to be put in a microwave oven before use and new ways of
dimpling the surface of golf balls are two of the areas where the spirit of
invention is thriving, according to the annual report of the Patent Office,
published yesterday.
The report says that 1990 and last year saw an overall decline in the number
of trademarks applied for, which it attributes to the decline in economic
activity. In the 15 months from January last year to March this year there
were 44,216 applications - 8.5 per cent down on the corresponding period to
March 1991.
The report highlights trends in inventions that reflect some of the concerns
of British society, such as the demand for cleaner air and greater road
safety.
It says the growth of the leisure industry has been responsible not only for
the ever-increasing sophistication of keep-fit machines, such as exercise
bikes, but also for the 'considerable activity in devising board games' in
spite of the popularity of video games.
Inventors in search of the ultimate nappy are still aiming for 'reduced bulk
and protection against leakage', the report notes. The central feature of
the microwavable nappy is a compressed pad which can be bulked up inside the
microwave before being used, so increasing its absorbency.
Continuing strong interest in inventions relating to garment hangers would
appear to underline the UK's reputation as a nation of shopkeepers, the
report notes. There is particular emphasis on hangers fitted with security
devices to deter shoplifting.
Innovatory precautions against theft feature heavily in other areas too,
including defence against the rise in so-called 'joyriding', devices to
protect empty properties and the development of a container to prevent
bundles of newspapers being taken from shop doorways in the early mornings.
