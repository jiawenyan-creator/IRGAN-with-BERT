FT  02 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rover: defeatism and short-termism
Sir, Your editorial, 'Don't cry over Rover' (February 1), is incredibly
complacent and defeatist. It is complacent because if you had bothered to
read the article, 'A sudden burst of acceleration', adjacent to your
editorial you wouldhave noted that one of the sad conclusions of the writer
is that the replacement for the Rover 800 will be based on a five-series BMW
platform. As a result it is clear that future research and development will
be concentrated in Germany, so Rover car production will inevitably become
an assembly unit. BMW will concentrate resources in Land Rover since it is
clear that it is this aspect of Rover which the German carmaker wants.
You are defeatist in suggesting that Britain does not have a viable future
in important areas of production. I find this a disturbing conclusion and I
would suggest that if, say, General Motors attempted to purchase BMW the
whole of Germany would be up in arms and such a proposed sale would never go
through.
I have purchased Rover cars for the last 10 years; whether I will continue
to buy a German Rover is another matter.
