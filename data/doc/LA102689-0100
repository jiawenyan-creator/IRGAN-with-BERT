DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 80,000 EXPECTED FOR POINT MUGU AIR SHOW 
More than 80,000 spectators are expected this weekend at the 1989 Point Mugu 
Air Show. The annual event Saturday and Sunday will showcase precision flying 
and aerobatic stunts by military and civilian pilots. 
The renowned Air Force Thunderbirds will highlight Saturday's schedule with a 
demonstration of flying skills used by Air Force tactical pilots in F-16 
Falcons. 
Sunday's lineup includes a flight demonstration by the California Air National 
Guard and the Armed Forces West Parachute Team. Top civilian pilots will appear 
both days. Featured performers include Earl Cherry and the Roll Models, who 
defy gravity with a wing-walking act akin to 1930s barnstorming, as they 
perform loops and rolls at 170 m.p.h. with a rider on the wing. 
Other flying acts include newcomer Team America, a three-plane act that puts on 
a military-style show in red, white and blue Marchetti SF-260 airplanes, and 
Joann Osterud in a high-performance biplane. Osterud recently completed 208 
loops to break the women's and men's world record for outside loops. 
Other stunt-flying acts will include the Sierra Aces Aerobatic Team and the 
Skylark North Aerobatic Team, and ex-Navy pilot Wayne Handley will perform 
aerial maneuvers in biplanes and gliders. 
Also appearing will be the Los Angeles Police Department's dragster and drag 
racer Les Shockley in his jet-engine-equipped Peterbilt truck, "Shockwave." 
Gates open at 8 a.m. each day and close at noon if parking is full. The show 
lasts until 4:30 p.m. both days and is free. Grandstand seats are $3. For 
information, call (805) 989-8786.
