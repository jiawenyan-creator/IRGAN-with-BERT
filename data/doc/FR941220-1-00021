 

Criteria for Evaluation of Section 182(f) Exemption Requests 


The NO

X

 RACT petition was submitted in accordance with the EPA guidance document entitled, 

Guideline for Determining the Applicability of Nitrogen Oxides Requirements Under Section 182(f)

 issued on December 16, 1993 (exemption guidance). In addition to the exemption guidance, EPA's NO

X

 exemption policy is contained in two memoranda

2

 providing that under section 182(f)(1)(A), an exemption from the NO

X

 requirements may be granted for nonattainment areas outside the OTR if EPA determines that additional reductions
of NO

X

 would not contribute to attainment of the NAAQS for those areas. In cases where a nonattainment area is demonstrating
attainment with three consecutive years of air quality monitoring data, without having implemented the section
182(f) NO

X

 provisions, it is clear that the contribute to attainment test is met, although additional reductions of NO

X

 might contribute to maintenance.

Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, dated September 17, 1993, entitled ``State
Implementation Plan (SIP) Requirements for Areas Submitting Requests for Redesignation to Attainment of the Ozone
and Carbon Monoxide (CO) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) on or after November 15, 1992'', and a subsequent
revision to this memorandum from John S. Seitz, Director of EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, issued
on May 27, 1994, entitled, ``Section 182(f) Nitrogen Oxides (NO

X

) Exemptions_Revised Process and Criteria''. 
</FOOTNOTE>


Thus, a State may submit a petition for a section 182(f) exemption based on air quality monitoring data. The EPA's approval
of the exemption, if warranted, would be granted on a contingent basis (i.e., the exemption would last for only as long
as the area's monitoring data continue to demonstrate attainment). 
EPA's exemption guidance provides that, pursuant to the requirements of section 110(a)(2), States should consider
evidence, such as photochemical grid modeling, which shows that granting the NO

X

 exemption would interfere with attainment or maintenance in downwind areas. The MBUAPCD has not yet implemented
NO

X

 RACT, and at the time of this notice, EPA has not received evidence from the State or any downwind areas that shows that
granting the NO

X

 exemption for the Monterey Bay Area would interfere with attainment or maintenance in downwind areas. 
EPA's conformity rules

 also reference the section 182(f) exemption process as a means for exempting affected areas from NO

X

 conformity requirements.

 Therefore, ozone nonattainment areas that are granted areawide section 182(f) exemptions will also be exempt from
the NO

X

 conformity requirements.

The section 182(f) exemption is explicitly referred to and is described in similar language in 40 CFR 51.394(b)(3)(i),
the ``Applicability'' section of the transportation conformity rule, and in the preamble (see 58 FR 62197, November
24, 1993). The language is repeated in the provisions of the rule regarding the motor vehicle emissions budget test
[section 51.428(a)(1)(ii)] and the ``build/no-build'' test [sections 51.436(e), 51.438(e)], although section
182(f) of the Act is not specifically mentioned. In the general conformity rule, the section 182(f) NO

X

 exemption is referred to in section 51.852 (definition of ``Precursors of a criteria pollutant'') and is discussed
in the preamble (see 58 FR 63240, November 30, 1993).

EPA Evaluation 


Attainment of the ozone NAAQS is determined based on the expected number of exceedances in a calendar year. Ozone attainment
must rely on three complete, consecutive calendar years of quality-assured air quality monitoring data, collected
in accordance with 40 CFR parts 50 and 58, including Appendices. The method for determining attainment of the ozone
NAAQS is contained in 40 CFR part 50, 50.9 and appendix H to that Section.

6

 appendix H of 40 CFR part 50 explains how to determine when the expected number of days per calendar year with maximum
hourly average concentrations above 0.12 ppm ozone is equal to or less than 1. This section also discusses how to account
for incomplete data sets. The EPA ``Guideline for the Interpretation of Ozone Air Quality Standards'' elaborates
on Appendix H. In general, expected exceedances are calculated by averaging actual exceedances at each monitoring
site over a three year period. An area is in attainment of the standard if this average results in expected exceedances
for each monitoring site of 1.0 or less per calendar year.
