FT  24 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
London's robusta COFFEE futures climbed to the highest levels since the
London Commodity Exchange's dollar contract was introduced in March 1991 as
the market continued to be aided by concern about nearby supply tightness.
The prompt September position touched Dollars 1,253 a tonne and the November
quotation Dollars 1,222 a tonne. The latter closed at Dollars 1,220 a tonne,
up Dollars 18. But dealers said the turnover was fairly light at just 2,825
lots (5 tonnes each) despite signs of continued roaster buying in the
physical market, particularly of lower grade beans. COCOA also continued on
its recent uptrend, closing with gains of up to Pounds 18 a tonne. Dealers
said both charts and the market's fundamentals appeared to be pointing
towards higher levels. The first objective was to overcome the
psychologically barrier at Pounds 800 a tonne for the December position,
which closed Pounds 15 up at Pounds 794 a tonne. At the London Metal
Exchange three months COPPER surged in the afternoon to end at Dollars
1,923.50 a tonne, a gain of Dollars 16.50 a tonne from Friday. Traders
attributed the rise to commission house buying, possibly including orders on
Chinese account.
