FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: All-round growth lifts David Smith to
Pounds 40.4m
Pre-tax profits at David S Smith (Holdings), the paper, packaging and office
supplies group, jumped from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds 40.4m in the six months
to October 29.
Mr Peter Williams, chief executive, said he was disappointed at a share
price rise of just 1p to 499p. He ascribed the flat response to Monday's
report from SG Warburg which assessed the group as a paper stock, pitted
against global competitors.
Mr Williams said that paper only accounted for 25 per cent of turnover since
the acquisition of Kaysersberg Packaging and Spicers, the stationery
wholesaler and manufacturer.
He also believed that Warburg had wrongly estimated the overcapacity in
Europe. He said that although historically paper companies tended to
underperform the market when new capacity came on stream, recent
announcements of new capacity would not yet meet the demand.
Turnover grew 41 per cent to Pounds 475.4m (Pounds 337.9m). Without Spicers,
which was only in last time's figures for three months, the rise would have
been 20 per cent. Operating profits jumped to Pounds 45.6m (Pounds 19.5m)
and without Spicers would have been Pounds 36.2m.
Mr Williams said the sharp rises could be attributed to three factors.
First, the economic upturn in Smith's markets, particularly the UK and
Ireland, where operating profits rose to Pounds 35.9m (Pounds 11.2m) on
turnover of Pounds 355.5m (Pounds 243.7m).
Second, the modernised Kemsley mill 'came even righter than we thought',
capitalising on the upturn in the cycle. Third, prices for waste,
artificially depressed by German environmental policies, became more
responsive to market forces. These factors led to an improvement in
operating margins from 5.8 to 9.6 per cent.
Raw material prices rose by up to 50 per cent and were set to rise further,
said Mr Williams.
Gearing advanced from 37 per cent at the end of April to 41 per cent as
borrowings rose by Pounds 21.3m over the six months to Pounds 141.6m.
The interim dividend is lifted to 4.25p (2.75p) and earnings expanded to
20.4p (9.3p) per share.
COMMENT
The City has been upgrading forecasts since April; even so the profits came
in about Pounds 5m higher than expectations. Warburg's report seems a little
short-sighted given Smith's broadened and strengthened portfolio. The
upswing looks to last longer than predicted, peaking as late as 1998-99,
when some City voices reckon earnings could climb to 70p-80p. Anyway, Smith
has bought itself protection with Kaysersberg and Spicers. With pre-tax
profits redrawn at Pounds 90m for the current year and Pounds 118m the
following (giving earnings of 45.4p and 56.7p respectively), the multiples
would be 11 and 8.8. The latter is a 25 per cent discount to the market.
