FT  08 FEB 92 / Selling of Timeshare properties
THE BEHAVIOUR of some companies selling timeshare properties borders on the
'fraudulent', Mr Andrew Hunter, Conservative MP for Basingstoke, told the
Commons yesterday, Ivor Owen writes.
He secured an unopposed second reading for a private member's bill requiring
a 14-day 'cooling-off' for timeshare contracts. Mr Edward Leigh, consumer
affairs minister, promised full government support.
Mr Hunter said the offer of prizes persuaded some people to attend
'presentations' during which 'every trick in the book' was used to induce
them to sign a contract.
Mr Leigh said the Department of Trade and Industry received more complaints
about the timeshare sector than about any other in industry.
