FT  05 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Ontario set to lead in
Canadian borrowing
THE Province of Ontario looks set to be the first major Canadian borrower of
the year, writes Brian Bollen.
It plans this month to launch its third global US dollar bond issue, through
Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers, to complete its borrowing programme for
the financial year ending March 31 and pre-funding part of next year's. The
maturity is likely to be between seven and 10 years, and the amount around
Dollars 2bn, says Salomon Brothers.
The World Bank plans to launch its 30-year US dollar global bond towards the
end of this week. The bank will be looking to raise Dollars 1bn to Dollars
1.5bn over 30 years with an issue which will be non-callable and stripable,
allowing banks to detach the coupons on the bonds and sell them separately.
