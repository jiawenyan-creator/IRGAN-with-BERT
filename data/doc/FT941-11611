FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Baring Venture in US link for media fund
Baring Venture Partners and Communications Equity Associates, a US provider
of investment banking services to the media industry, have raised a Dollars
65m (Pounds 43.3m) venture capital fund aimed exclusively at unquoted media
and communications companies in Europe.
Baring Communications Equity has taken five months to raise the fund, which
will be invested in 'classic development capital for companies that are
still growing fast.' It will not fund start-ups.
Mr Terrence Tehranian, a partner in BCEL, said the fund would be the biggest
in Europe to invest in the sector.
The number of new licenses being issued, deregulation and the breaking up of
state-wned monopolies made the area particularly attractive.
BCEL will invest in four main areas - cable and satellite television,
terrestrial broadcasting, publishing and telecommunications, with a focus on
the UK, Germany, France and Spain.
Mr Jeff Montgomery, a BCEL partner, said that in the US some Dollars 3.5bn
(Pounds 2.3bn) of private equity was focused on the media and communications
industry; the advertising growth rate in the sector, however, had fallen to
about 1 per cent a year.
In Europe, by contrast, a tenth of that sum was dedicated to media and
communications companies, which were enjoying significant growth.
A number of other venture capital companies have tried without success in
the last three years to raise funds focused on the media.
