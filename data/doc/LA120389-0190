COMPARING COSTS OF SPRING AND FALL ELECTIONS IN TUSTIN 
As a resident of neighboring Orange, I thoroughly enjoyed your Sunday editorial 
"Tustin Springs Backward" (Nov. 26), about the Tustin City Council's 
unprecedented decision to shift its city elections from November to April, 
thereby allowing potential challengers only four months to organize their 
campaigns. 
It should also be noted that Mayor Richard B. Edgar had previously stated that 
a special April election would attract "better-informed" voters. By that he 
presumably means "better informed" by himself or Mayor Pro Tem Ursula E. 
Kennedy, but not by his opponents, who would be hard-pressed for time to 
effectively present their own views and who lack the financial resources of 
developers' contributions that Mayor Edgar so richly enjoys himself. 
I sincerely hope that Tustin residents will succeed in challenging the 
election-date switch and return a sense of fairness to its elected government.
