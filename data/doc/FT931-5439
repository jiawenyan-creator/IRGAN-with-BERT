FT  05 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian buyers rescue Greek
citrus sales
STRONG DEMAND from Russia this winter has helped to compensate Greek orange
growers for lost market share in the European Community.
Exports of oranges reached 262,700 tonnes, a 13.6 per cent rise from last
year, according to the Greek Fruit Exporters' Association.
The Soviet Union had been Greece's biggest customer for citrus fruit, taking
about 250,000 tonnes every winter. But demand collapsed with its break-up
and the demise of the state purchasing system and Russian importers bought a
paltry 3,500 tonnes in the winter of 1991-92. This winter, however, they
were back with a vengeance, buying more than 150,000 tonnes.
'Citrus fever overtook the Russians this winter. We could have sold them
practically the whole Greek crop, if it were possible to ship it all,' said
Mr George Frangistas of Gefra, one of Greece's largest fruit exporters.
Gefra exported about 48,000 tonnes of oranges to Russia, selling mainly to
small private import companies, he said.
However, Greek orange exports to other EC countries fell by 61 per cent over
the same period to 15,100 tonnes, most of which went to Germany.
Following a much-improved harvest, exports of lemons reached 35,900 tonnes,
compared with only 8,800 tonnes last winter. Russian importers showed no
interest in Greek lemons but demand was lively in other eastern European
countries.
Increasing competition from Spanish and Italian producers, who have lower
transport costs and grow the thin-skinned orange varieties that are more
attractive to supermarket buyers, has steadily eroded Greece's share of the
EC market.
Now that the single market is in force, Greek orange producers can no longer
claim subsidies for exporting elsewhere in the community. A bumper crop of
about 1m tonnes has kept producer prices below Dr40 (20 US cents) a kilogram
for all but the best fruit.
While domestic demand for table oranges remains steady at about 300,000
tonnes, processing of orange concentrate for juice, which usually accounts
for another 200,000 tonnes, will decline this year. Processors were hit
badly by an 80 per cent drop in prices for imported Brazilian concentrate.
