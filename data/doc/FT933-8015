FT  18 AUG 93 / Observer: Containment
Tiphook's finance director, Rodger Braidwood, walked the plank yesterday - a
move thoroughly well-leaked, as has become the wont of the appropriately
named company.
Nothing surprising in that, given the catalogue of recent financial
disasters. But why did he not go at prelims time in July - surely something
else has not gone wrong? And why is he being replaced by his deputy, Andrew
Chandler, who has been there since 1990 and so is no new broom.
The answer is probably that Tiphook, shuddering under gearing levels of 470
per cent, could scarcely allow itself the luxury of a lengthy executive
search, even if it thought it could lure the right person. And Chandler is
by all accounts a slightly more down-to-earth character than his flamboyant
predecessor.
Quite enough entrepreneurial flair is resident in chairman Robert Montague.
