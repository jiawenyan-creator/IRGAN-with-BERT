FT  06 AUG 92 / Fraud probe cuts benefit claims
MORE THAN 50,000 people withdrew claims for unemployment benefit last year -
with a saving of Pounds 34m to the taxpayer - after investigations by fraud
teams, the government announced yesterday, Lisa Wood writes.
The figures were criticised as 'greatly exaggerated' by the Unemployment
Unit, a watchdog organisation for claimants. It said many of the 50,000
could have left of their own accord, with 13 per cent of all claimants
leaving the unemployment register every month.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, said: 'While the vast majority
of benefit claims are genuine, these figures show there continues to be a
large number of people who are working and claiming benefits intended for
the unemployed. We owe it to them - and the taxpayer - to crack down on this
fraud.'
Forty-nine employers - three times as many as in the previous year - were
prosecuted for conspiring with workers to claim unemployment benefit
illegally so they could pay them low wages.
Between April last year and March this year the total number of claims for
unemployment benefit was 4.947m, with the Department of Employment
estimating an underpayment of Pounds 29.6m. According to the Employment
Service 780 inspectors last year launched 232,000 separate investigations,
resulting in 2,265 prosecutions.
