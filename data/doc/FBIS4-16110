  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 12, BNS -- The Estonian Government 
decided at its session today to establish a special regime in 
the northwest Estonian Pakri peninsula where Paldiski is 
situated. The regime will be in force during the dismantling of 
nuclear reactors at the former Russian naval training center in 
the town and the removal of nuclear fuel from Estonia. 
  The safety regulations allow people to enter the peninsula 
only through special checkpoints and restrict their movement in 
the territory. People who neither live nor work in the area 
need special licenses issued either by the Paldiski commandant 
or the Harjumaa police to enter the peninsula. In case of need, 
the Interior Ministry is allowed to restrict or entirely close 
traffic in Pakri. 
  The government charged the Police Department with stepping 
up 
control in the peninsula to find out the people who have no 
permits for staying in the area. 
  The Cabinet's order appoints Juri Tikk, special 
representative of the government in Paldiski, as coordinator of 
activities of the agencies involved. 
  Tikk told BNS in an earlier interview the first stage of 
dismantling the Paldiski reactors, which involves the removal of 
nuclear fuel from the reactors and from Estonia, would probably 
begin after April 10. The operation takes place in three stages 
and will take about three years to complete.
