U.S., SOVIETS NEAR NERVE GAS ACCORD 
U.S. and Soviet negotiators reported major progress in Geneva toward an 
agreement on deep cuts in stockpiles of lethal nerve gas and other chemical 
weapons that could be signed at the June summit. The superpowers also agreed on 
mutual inspections of facilities for "safe, speedy and also economically and 
ecologically sound" destruction of stockpiled weapons. Another round of talks 
will begin around April 23 and the two sides are confident about having the 
accord ready for President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev when 
they meet in late June in the United States, officials said.
