FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Banco Internacional sold off
THE MEXICAN government has sold 51 per cent of Banco Internacional for
1,487bn pesos (Dollars 475m) to an investor group headed by shareholders in
Prime, a leading Mexican stockbroker.
Banco Internacional is the 17th to be sold by the Mexican government in just
over 12 months, and brings the total proceeds from the privatisations to
36,600bn pesos. Bids for the last bank to be sold, Banco del Centro, are due
on Friday, with the winner likely to be announced on Sunday.
The successful privatisation may boost confidence in the Mexican stock
market, which has suffered sharp falls for two weeks. On Thursday, Grupo
Banamex-Accival, comprising Mexico's largest bank, postponed a USDollars 1bn
global share offering for 220m 'C' shares, after the price per 'C' share had
slipped from an original 22,400 pesos to 16,600.
Prime outbid two other groups in the auction and paid 2.95 times book value
and 12.32 times prospective earnings for 1992. It will form an integrated
financial group, housing the bank, brokerage, and other financial
intermediaries.
Banco Internacional is Mexico's fifth-largest bank, with assets of 25,000bn
pesos, 5.8 per cent of the total, and annual profits to May of 123.69bn
pesos. The bank was one of the last to be sold because of its poor
capital-asset ratio, bad loan portfolio, and small deposit base. Recently,
provisions for bad loans have been made, and the capital-asset ratio has
improved.
