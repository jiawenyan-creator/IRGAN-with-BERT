FT  17 NOV 92 / Bhutto set for clash on march
THERE was little hope in Pakistan last night that the government of Prime
Minister Mr Nawaz Sharif and opposition parties led by former prime minister
Ms Benazir Bhutto could avoid their most bitter confrontation tomorrow.
Opposition activists will try to march into the capital, Islamabad despite a
ban on protesters entering the city.
Ms Bhutto has planned the march in the hope of a comeback on a populist
tide. She claims thousands of her supporters have been arrested since the
weekend .
The march could pose a serious test for the ruling alliance but political
observers do not foresee an immediate change of government.
A large turnout would intensify political pressure on Mr Sharif, who came to
power in elections two years ago after Ms Bhutto's government was dismissed
on charges of corruption.
Mr Sharif appears to have become vulnerable since a split earlier this year
within the ruling Islamic Democratic Alliance led to a break with the
Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), the powerful regional party in Karachi,
Pakistan's largest city and heart of the country's corporate and financial
sectors.
Though he still claims to have a simple majority in Parliament, he has lost
the two-thirds majority which gave him the opportunity to bring about
constitutional changes. There are also new concerns about the economy, with
the government estimating recent flood damage at between Rs40bn and Rs50bn
(Pounds 1.05bn and Pounds 1.28bn).
Opposition activists, who have repeatedly accused the government of
corruption and failure to resolve important national issues, are demanding
an interim 'national consensus government' representing a broad spectrum of
political parties as a prelude to'free and fair elections.'
