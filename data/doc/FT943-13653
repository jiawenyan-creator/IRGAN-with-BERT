FT  19 JUL 94 / Bargaining setback for pulp unions
The British Columbia Labour Relations Board has ordered the province's pulp
and paper unions to negotiate with companies individually, reversing a
50-year tradition of industry-wide bargaining, reports Robert Gibbens from
Montreal.
The unions have been without a contract for several months and, with surging
company profits, had insisted that industry-wide bargaining be a
precondition of serious negotiating.
The board ordered the unions to proceed with negotiating new labour
contracts with a dozen big companies. It said the unions' stand for
industry-wide bargaining flouted current labour laws requiring bargaining in
good faith. The companies ended industry-wide bargaining last January.
