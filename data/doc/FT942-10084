FT  12 MAY 94 / Observer: Baby choirs
BhS, the retail store chain, either cares naught for product placement or
has never heard of Britain's biggest union.
The public services union, Unison - which has 1.5m members - is celebrating
the discovery of its own name splashed across a whole range of BhS
children's clothing.
Could this be a brand new marketing opportunity? The union gets free
advertising, and BhS can tout its wares among Unison members keen to
identify with their offspring.
Where will it all end? NUT caps or Cohse sweaters?
