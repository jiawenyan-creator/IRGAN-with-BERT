FT  20 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Freight ignored in assessing
Eurotunnel's prospects
Sir, I would like to correct a misconception in the Lex column regarding
Eurotunnel ('Tunnel vision', October 12). As any transport student would
tell you, Eurotunnel is not a glorified fixed-link version of a
roll-on-roll-off ferry, nor is it a short-haul flight.
Half the capacity is dedicated to international rail traffic, yet one does
not hear of this side of the business, only of 'Le Shuttle' - a reflection
on whoever does the marketing for 'Eurostar'.
The important point is that this project will connect the UK with a growing
continental TGV system, and will revolutionise freight handling. No sane
person will change a mode of transport twice when there is a direct and fast
city centre to city centre service. No sane businessman will send goods via
ship in the face of a simpler freight alternative that delivers door-to-door
within 24 hours.
On this basis, the demands upon tunnel capacity will grow, and it is likely
that a second one will be in the planning stage by the turn of the century.
