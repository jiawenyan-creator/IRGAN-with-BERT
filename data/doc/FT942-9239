FT  17 MAY 94 / Observer: Waves from the ocean
Bernard Tapie, France's much-investigated businessman cum politician, seems
to have added an offshore tax problem to his many woes - in the shape of his
splendiferous yacht.
Currently away from her usual berth undergoing repairs, the Phocea,
so-called to evoke the ancient name for Marseille, normally bobs about right
in front of the town hall in the midst of the city where Tapie would be
mayor.
But the French authorities are threatening to take the wind out of Phocea's
sails. Until now, the four-masted, 74-metre schooner, purchased a decade ago
from the widow of racing sailor Alain Colas, has been registered as a
'commercial' vessel. Hence Tapie has been able to treat large renovation
expenses as a business tax deduction - not to mention escape paying VAT when
the yacht was originally imported from Tahiti.
Now the tax people are jibbing at the boat's commercial status, and are also
investigating whether Tapie may have used money from his various companies
in order to help with the lovely lady's very considerable running costs.
Another interested party has also surfaced. According to its new president
Jean Peyrelevade, Credit Lyonnais has slapped a lien on the yacht as
security for Tapie's unrepaid debts to the bank.
Tapie's own cork-like properties, meanwhile, were amply demonstrated when an
Ifop poll, published in the weekly Journal du Dimanche, showed the Marseille
deputy to be the 14th most popular person in France.
Not a single other politician makes it into the top 15.
