FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Buoyant sales help Tie Rack advance to
Pounds 872,000
BUOYANT TRADING helped Tie Rack more than double pre-tax profits from Pounds
301,000 to Pounds 872,000 in the specialist retailer's seasonally weak first
half to August 15.
Sales rose from Pounds 25.3m to Pounds 33m as the company, which trades in
14 countries, moved into Germany and Switzerland, as well as franchising an
outlet in Austria.
'The healthy increase in profits has been generated by good sales growth in
the UK, Australia and continental Europe generally,' said Mr Roy Bishko,
chairman.
He said sales in the second half were satisfactory.
'We are fairly cautious about the rest of the year because we consider
consumer confidence is still fairly fragile and there are all sorts of
warning signs about the November budget which could not be worst timed for
retailers.'
Tie Rack, which claims 12 per cent of the fragmented Pounds 200m UK tie
market, increased outlets to 282 (262), an increase of 10 since the
beginning of the year, with 149 in the UK and 133 overseas.
Franchises are now less than 18 per cent of the total.
Since the half year end a further 10 shops had been opened and a further 12
were planned, the company said.
Operating profits jumped to Pounds 787,000 (Pounds 162,000).
Net cash balances were Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 768,000) at the half-way stage on
the back of strong profits performance over the last 12 months as well as
lower working capital.
Capital expenditure, at Pounds 1m (Pounds 500,000), had been lower than
depreciation charges.
The company has yet to pay last year's Pounds 2m tax charge which will be
paid in the second half.
Interest payments were Pounds 167,000 (Pounds 161,000).
Tie Rack expects to spend Pounds 3m developing the business over the full
year, including Pounds 500,000 as part of its Pounds 1.5m programme of
installing electronic funds transfer at point of sale technology in all
shops.
Earnings per share moved ahead from 0.38p to 1.05p.
