FT  01 APR 93 / Baltic pull-out row grows
General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, yesterday said his
announcement earlier this week that the withdrawal of Russian troops from
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania would be halted was 'a result of the
short-sighted, tough policy of Estonia and Latvia in relation to the
withdrawal process', John Lloyd writes from Moscow.
Gen Grachev, on an official visit to St Petersburg, said that Russia
intended to withdraw the troops in a 'civilised fashion'. But while there
were no agreements on how the cost of the withdrawal was to be borne, and on
social guarantees for the officers, withdrawal could not be completed.
