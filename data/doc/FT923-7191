FT  19 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drops 4.2 per
cent to another six-year low
SHARE prices plunged on small-lot selling by individuals and short-selling
by dealers, and the Nikkei average dropped 4.2 per cent to another six-year
low, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index fell 620.14 to close at the day's worst of 14,309.41, the lowest
level since March 1986. It opened at the session's high of 14,909.57 and
declined steadily on arbitrage unwinding and small-lot selling.
Volume picked up slightly from 141m shares to 170m. Traders said
institutional investors remained on the sidelines. Life insurers said the
risk of further declines in share prices remained. 'We cannot start buying
when we do not know how much further the market has to fall,' said an
official at Nippon Life.
Declines led advances by 801 to 131, with 128 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks lost 30.01 to 1,102.50, but in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 1.02 to 907.90.
New worries about corporate earnings prompted a fresh round of selling
yesterday; there were fears that companies in the high-technology sector may
revise their earnings forecasts downwards.
Heavy selling pulled Sony down Y230 to Y3,560 and Pioneer Electronic Y290 to
Y2,670. The two groups report quarterly corporate earnings today, and fears
that profit figures would be sharply lower than originally forecast
depressed share prices.
Other electricals were also weak, with Hitachi sliding Y34 to Y718 and
Toshiba Y17 to Y547. Traders noted short-selling by investors and dealers.
Nippon Housing Loan, the most active issue of the day, advanced Y27 to Y167.
The home-loan company announ-ced that its leading creditors had agreed to
reduce interest payments on the company's loans.
Non-life insurers were firm on bargain hunting by foreigners. Tokio Marine &amp;
Fire put on Y20 to Y1,000 and Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Y17 to Y672.
In Osaka, the OSE average finished 427.38 lower at 15,537.22 in turnover of
13.4m shares. Individual investors facing margin calls sold high-priced
issues to raise cash. Ono Pharmaceutical fell Y350 to Y4,830 and Nintendo
shed Y230 to Y9,550.
Roundup

mixed, but fairly subdued.

ADollars 186.8m.

morning. The old shares ended a cent above the issue price at ADollars 3.01.
Australian Provincial Newspapers sank 13 cents to ADollars 1.37 after saying
