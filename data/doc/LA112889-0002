WORLD IN BRIEF; 
ISRAEL; 
TROOPS FORCED WAY INTO CLINIC, U.N. SAYS 
Israeli troops forced their way into a U.N. clinic in the occupied Gaza Strip 
and tried to arrest a Palestinian receiving emergency treatment for a serious 
gunshot wound, a U.N. spokeswoman said. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency 
spokeswoman said the soldiers beat two employees at the clinic in the Bureij 
refugee camp and may have suffered broken bones. The 18-year-old Palestinian, 
identified as Mohammed Hisham Nasser, was brought to the clinic suffering from 
an army bullet wound in the upper arm which had apparently severed an artery, 
she added.
