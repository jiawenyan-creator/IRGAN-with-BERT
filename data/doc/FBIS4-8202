  [Text] Sarajevo, April 11 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs closed 
checkpoints out of Sarajevo Monday [11 April], witnesses said, 
as tension mounted in the city following NATO air strikes on 
Serb positions in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde. 
  Some 50 people waited in vain at the Bratstvo-Jedintsvo 
[Brotherhood and Unity] Bridge linking Sarajevo with the 
Serb-controlled Grbavica district but it remained shut, foreign 
photographers reported. 
  Even UN peacekeeping troops were stopped by Serb forces or 
delayed by formalities at the checkpoints, a UN spokesman said. 
  The closure of Serb checkpoints around Sarajevo followed 
Serb 
anger at air strikes Sunday and Monday on their troops' 
positions around besieged Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. 
  Bosnian Serbs overnight broke off all contacts with the UN 
protection force (UNPROFOR), while the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) Monday suspended its air bridge to Sarajevo. 
  A spokeswoman said UNHCR would reassess the situation 
Tuesday 
before deciding whether to resume airlifts of injured Bosnians 
out of Sarajevo to the Italian airforce base at Ancona. 
  The Bratstvo-Jedintsvo bridge out of Sarajevo was opened on 
March 24 under the surveillance of UN protection forces for 
civilians and humanitarian aid transport. 
  The only passable route to Sarajevo airport on Monday was a 
detour through the Dobrinja quarter of town, controlled by 
Moslem-led Bosnian Government forces. 
  An UNPROFOR spokesman said protection forces would wait and 
see how the situation developed in Sarajevo before deciding 
whether to take any action.
