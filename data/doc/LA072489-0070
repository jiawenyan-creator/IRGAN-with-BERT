TIMES SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY BOOK PRIZE 
Tom Johnson, publisher and chief executive officer of the Los Angeles Times, 
has announced that the newspaper will award a science and technology prize, 
beginning in fall, 1989, as part of its annual Book Prize program. 
The science and technology prize joins existing awards in fiction, poetry, 
history, biography and current interest, as well as the Robert Kirsch Award for 
a body of work by a writer living in or writing about the American West. The 
Times Book Prizes have been awarded since 1980. 
"This new award adds an important new dimension to our annual Book Prizes," 
Johnson said. "Science and technology have such a direct impact on our lives, 
more so than ever before. This state, for instance, is home to a score of 
science Nobel Prize winners and to major centers of technological and medical 
research. Our prize is, in a way, an acknowledgement of the importance of 
science to our readers." 
The new book prize is intended for works that are written for general 
audiences, according to Times Book Editor Jack Miles. He noted that the award 
relates directly to California's pre-eminence in scientific and technological 
research. 
"More important, it is an attempt to foster the further growth of scientific 
research, which depends upon a public consensus on its importance," Miles 
added. "Even the most serious science begins with popular science. It begins 
when a parent gives a child a favorite book about nature. It begins when a 
thoughtful librarian suggests the book that initiates a lifelong adventure. 
These are the books, and the habits, that we hope our new prize will promote." 
The Times Book Prize winners each receive a cash prize of $1,000. Nominations 
are solicited every year from 100 Times book reviewers. Finalists and winners 
are chosen by committees of three judges per category, all of whom are 
anonymous. 
The 1989 Book Prize winners will be announced in late September. The prizes 
will be presented in a ceremony at The Times in early November.
