SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NURSING HOME TO PAY FINE 
Bay Harbor Rehabilitation Center administrators have agreed to pay a $12,000 
fine and bring in a nursing consultant to settle civil charges of improper 
patient care at the center, a Torrance nursing home. 
From November, 1987, until January, 1989, county health inspectors reported a 
number of problems at the nursing home, including incorrect administration of 
medicine, failure to properly track patient conditions and poor hygiene, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Rod Leonard. 
The settlement, in which the nursing home will pay a $1,000 fine each month for 
the next year, is not an admission of guilt, said Bay Harbor attorney Bob 
Gerst. The nursing home maintains that the charges were the result of differing 
opinions between inspectors and hospital employees about record-keeping. 
The special consultant required by the settlement already works for the 
hospital under a contract to review nursing practices, Gerst said. Under the 
settlement, the consultant will submit written recommendations every 30 days 
for review by county inspectors. 
Leonard said conditions at the nursing home have improved significantly since 
charges were first filed in October, 1988, and that county officials have given 
Bay Harbor a clean bill of health in recent inspections.
