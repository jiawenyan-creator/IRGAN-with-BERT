CHUNG AND BRANDO 
I always knew that TV's Connie Chung was a lightweight, and her interview with 
Marlon Brando last Saturday proved it. It was like a teeny-bopper journalist 
asking questions of a rock idol. She was weak and obviously intimidated. 
Brando's arrogance, his jerklike acting and his demeaning of his profession 
made him less than a riveting interviewee. But wouldn't a Mike Wallace or a Sam 
Donaldson or a Barbara Walters have challenged him -- and given us more of an 
insight into this very private and talented man?
