 

There are approximately 65 handlers regulated under the marketing order each year and approximately 1,800 producers
of Bartlett pears. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601]
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of Bartlett pear handlers and producers in Oregon and Washington
may be classified as small entities. 

The budget of expenses for the 199495 fiscal year was prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for
local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee
are producers and handlers of Bartlett pears. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods
and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated
and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and
provide input. 

The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of fresh Bartlett pears grown in Oregon and Washington. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must
be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses.

The Committee met on June 2, 1994, and unanimously recommended total expenses of $96,410 with an assessment rate of
$0.02 per standard box or equivalent for the 199495 fiscal year. In comparison, 199394 budgeted expenses
were $112,425, with an approved assessment rate of $0.025 per standard box or equivalent. This represents a $16,015
decrease in expenses and a $0.005 decrease in the assessment rate from the amounts recommended for the current fiscal
year. 

The assessment rate, when applied to anticipated pear shipments of 2,721,886 standard boxes or equivalent, will
yield $54,438 in assessment income. Assessment income, combined with $4,000 from other income sources, and $37,972
from the Committee's authorized reserve, will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. The withdrawal of $37,972
from the Committee's authorized reserve fund will result in no reserve remaining at the end of the 199495 fiscal
year. 
Major expense categories for the 199495 fiscal year include $42,683 for salaries, $17,597 for unshared contingency,
and $4,695 in employee health benefits. 

An interim final rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 on [59 FR 44311, August 29, 1994] and provided a 30-day comment period for interested persons. No comments were received.


While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be
incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rate to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the
declared policy of the Act. 

It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 

Federal Register

 [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 199495 fiscal year for the program began July 1, 1994. The marketing order requires that the rate
of assessment apply to all assessable Bartlett pears handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are aware
of this action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the 

Federal Register

 as an interim final rule. No comments were received concerning the interim final rule that is adopted in this action
as a final rule without change.
