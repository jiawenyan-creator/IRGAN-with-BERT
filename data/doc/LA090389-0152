Sammie Smith, the Miami Dolphins' top draft pick, said he has reached an 
impasse on contract talks and is willing to sit out the season or be traded. 
The Florida State tailback said he came down $200,000 this week, from $2.95 
million for a four-year contract, and also was willing to take a three-year 
contract, but Miami rejected both offers, he said. The team's final offer was 
$2.45 million.
