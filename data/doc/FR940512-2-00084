Statement </DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. section 16 (b) through (h),
that a proposed Final Judgment, a Stipulation and a Competitive Impact Statement have been filed with the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia in 

United States of America

 v. 

Tele-Communications, Inc. and Liberty Media Corporation,

 Civil No. 940948.

The Complaint in the case alleges that the effect of the proposed merger between the two defendants, Tele-Communications,
Inc. and Liberty Media Corporation, may be substantially to lessen competition among multichannel subscription
television providers and video programming providers.

The proposed Final Judgment enjoins the defendants from (A) discriminating against unaffiliated video programming
offered by such providers, where the effect of such discrimination is unreasonably to restrain competition; and
(B) discriminating against unaffiliated multichannel subscription television providers in the sale or license
of video programming, where the effect of such discrimination is unreasonably to restrain competition. These injunctions
apply with respect to the conduct of organizations under the defendants' control. With interest not amounting to
control, the proposed Final Judgment enjoins defendants from seeking or supporting conduct that would violate (A)
or (B) above is engaged in directly by defendants.

Public comment on the proposed Final Judgment is invited within the statutory 60-day comment period. Such comments
and responses thereto will be published in the 

Federal Register

 and filed with the Court. Comments should be directed to Richard L. Rosen, Chief, Communications and Finance Section,
Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, 555 4th Street NW., room 8104, Washington, DC 20001 (telephone: 202/5145621).
