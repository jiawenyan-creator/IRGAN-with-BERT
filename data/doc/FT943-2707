FT  17 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Kingfisher disappoints - At a Glance
Kingfisher, the UK retailing group which includes BQ, Comet, Superdrug,
Woolworths, and France's Darty, this week disappointed the market in spite
of announcing a 7.4 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds
82m to Pounds 88.1m.
The increase - at the bottom end of forecasts - was more than accounted for
by a rise from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 35.7m in profits contribution from
Darty, acquired by Kingfisher only two months before the end of the first
half last year. Excluding Darty from both years, retail operating profits
fell from Pounds 57.5m to Pounds 47.7m.
