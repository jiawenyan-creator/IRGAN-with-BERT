  [Text] The Islamic Republic of Iran and Qatar are planning 
to set up a technical committee to study cooperation in the 
extraction of gas from joint reserves in the Persian Gulf. 
  On his return from Qatar yesterday, Petroleum Minister 
Aqazadeh announced the project. He said: The Islamic Republic 
of Iran and Qatar jointly own a vast gas reserve in the Persian 
Gulf and Qatar has started extracting from it. 
  With the establishment of a committee, which is to meet in 
Tehran next month, the two countries will cooperate in 
exchanging the technical knowledge, utilization, and sale of gas 
from this joint reserve. 
  Petroleum Minister Aqazadeh, who was speaking to our 
correspondent, referred to the upcoming OPEC ministerial session 
to be held 15 June in Vienna. He said: The session was 
discussed with the Qatari petroleum minister. Since there is a 
vast difference between the current oil price and the $21 price 
approved by OPEC, Iran and Qatar--in their capacity as 
members--have made efforts to develop a common stance on how to 
resolve the problems facing OPEC.
