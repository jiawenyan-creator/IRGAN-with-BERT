CHANNEL 13 HIRES HERNANDEZ; JACOBS OUT 
Channel 13 has hired Channel 2 sportscaster Tony Hernandez, news director Jeff 
Wald said Monday. 
Vic (the Brick) Jacobs' Channel 13 contract, which expires at the end of the 
month, will not be renewed. 
Jacobs has been at the station since the summer of 1988. 
Hernandez will remain at Channel 2 until June 30, and begin at Channel 13 July 
2. Jacobs, who came to Channel 13 from Fresno, is expected to remain at the 
station until Hernandez takes over. 
Hernandez, reached in Portland, Ore., where he is covering the NBA finals, said 
he was notified through his agent, Burt Shapiro, a month ago that Channel 2 was 
terminating his contract. 
"My contract actually runs through 1991, but my cycle was up," he said. "What 
they offered was a new one-year contract at a 25% salary cut. 
"What I regret is that all this was done through my agent. Neither Mr. Hyland 
(general manager Bob) nor (news director) Michael Singer ever spoke to me 
personally. I wish someone had been conscientious enough to have called me in." 
Hernandez said sports director Keith Olbermann knew that his contract had been 
terminated. "I got the impression Keith wanted me to stay," Hernandez said. 
Hernandez was at Channel 7 for 5 1/2 years and was at Channel 2 for nearly 6 
1/2. 
Hernandez said what appealed to him about the Channel 13 offer was a 
Monday-through-Friday schedule, the fact that he would be No. 1 at Channel 13, 
and that Channel 13 gave him a three-year contract. 
"I will be the sports director," Hernandez said. "In my 12 years here, I have 
never been the No. 1 person at a Los Angeles station, and I'm excited about 
that."
