RESPONSE TO 'ALLIED WAR CRIMES' 
In March 1945, the German Army unit I served with surrendered to American 
soldiers. I was relieved that the war was finally over and our captors were not 
Soviet forces. 
If we had known the misery we had to endure, we would have probably preferred 
the British or Canadians. 
At Remagen, our menu (and other issue) with slight variations consisted of a 
spoon of milk and eggpowder, toilet paper and some soap at the beginning, no 
latrines available. An extremely wet spring changed the ground into a muddy 
quagmire. No cover, no blankets, only the clothes on our bodies. Amongst the 
masses of POWs one could find amputees, very young boys and old men in their 
60s. 
In seconds we swallowed our daily ration, thinking about food the hours to 
come, listening to discussions about the nutritional value of insects, worms 
and grass. I saw some prisoners eating those. 
A tiny percentage was able to join work commands in and outside the camp. My 
knowledge of the English language made it possible to act as interpreter, which 
improved my situation somewhat. When transferred to another camp, there were 
fights for the few slices of bread thrown to us from civilians. 
In fall we were transported to Luneville, France. There we were fed with a 
watery soup twice a day and a slice of bread. Volunteers who carried the bodies 
out received an extra ration of soup.
