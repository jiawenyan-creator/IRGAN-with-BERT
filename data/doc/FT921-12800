FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (32): A
happy anniversary for some - TESSAs / Savers who opened an account at launch
are now entitled to add to it
IF YOU have money languishing in a bank or building society account, now is
the time to top up your Tessa (tax-exempt special savings account). Those
who opened a Tessa last January can now put in the second instalment, up to
a limit of Pounds 1,800.
To obtain the best gains, you should try to put in the maximum amounts each
year as early as possible. Statistics suggest that investors are doing just
that: more than 2.7m Tessa accounts were opened in the year to September and
around Pounds 7bn deposited, according to Treasury figures. This represents
an average of just under Pounds 2,600 in each Tessa opened.
The average rate of interest paid last year on Tessas was about 12.9 per
cent - a healthy return, particularly as it is tax-free provided you keep
the Tessa over the full five-year period. This means that those who put in
the maximum Pounds 3,000 last year will already have earned around Pounds
387 in interest.
Investors are allowed to draw the net interest on the Tessa, but must leave
the capital untouched in order to qualify for the tax-free element.
The table, of the best performing Tessas for 1991, shows the value of Pounds
3,000 on the first anniversary of the account. Only bonuses paid at the end
of the first year have been included, because they will accrue further
interest. Bonuses paid at the end of the five-year period have therefore
been excluded.
Tessas are theoretically transferable, so you can move to another
institution if you feel you are getting a raw deal. Before doing so,
however, check that you are not going to be losing a good bonus in order to
chase a higher rate of interest. For example, Kent Reliance, Lambeth and
Norwich and Peterborough building societies will all pay a bonus of a
maximum of Pounds 300 at the end of the five-year term. This may well
outperform even the better interest rates.
Also check on transfer penalties. Barclays, which had the most draconian -
the loss of all interest on the first year if transferred - has now dropped
this in favour of a Pounds 25 transfer fee. In some cases, the transfer
penalty may outweigh the benefit of a more attractive rate of interest.
Finally, check that the operator you wish to switch to will actually accept
the Tessa, and remember that a society offering a good rate of interest now
may not do so in the future.
