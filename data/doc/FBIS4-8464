Congresses, Colonel Agim Shehu, director of the order police, 
and Colonel Vexhi Mucmataj, director of the investigative 
police, gave a news conference on the murders by the Greek 
commando on the Greek border. 
  After describing the event again on the basis of the facts 
and the evidence, Shehu said that the evidence regarding the 
objective, participation, way of committing the action, etc. 
shows that we are dealing with forces that are constituent parts 
of the Greek Army. 
  Reporters asked a number of questions about the expertise, 
armament, level of responsibility and authorship of the crime, 
and about the measures taken by the Public Order Ministry. 
  Colonel Vexhi Mucmataj said that three employees in the 
Public Order Ministry have been arrested: the inspector of 
border police in Gjirokaster, the supervisor of the border post, 
and the training chief. We will forward their documents to the 
Investigation Office. 
  Regarding a report carried by several news agencies on a 
Greek request for a joint investigation commission, Shehu said 
that no such request had been received.
