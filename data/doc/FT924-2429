FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: PPI creditors given hope of 10% return
CREDITORS of Polly Peck International could recover 10 per cent of their
loans following the sale of the subsidiary, Del Monte Fresh Produce.
However, administrators have also warned that a dispute over how funds were
routed could mean that creditors receive only 4p in the pound, or even
nothing
This range of forecasts comes in the latest six-monthly report to creditors
by Polly Peck's administrators, Coopers and Lybrand. The figures do not take
account of any possible recoveries by joint administrator Touche Ross, which
is suing various parties on Polly Peck's behalf.
Polly Peck, the fruit, electronics and leisure conglomerate, collapsed with
debts of Pounds 1.3bn in October 1990. The sale in August this year of its
Del Monte subsidiary to a group of Mexican investors represented the best
chance for the creditors of receiving a significant payment.
A total of Dollars 218m remained after repayment of a bank syndicate that
financed the acquisition of Del Monte But administrators are uncertain
whether a Polly Peck subsidiary was used to route funds for the original Del
Monte acquisition.
If acquisition funds passed through Polly Peck Finance a group of 11 banks
stood to gain as principal creditors of this subsidiary, the report said.
This routing of funds would mean creditors of the parent would receive 4p in
the pound. But if the funds did not pass through Polly Peck Finance general
creditors could get 10p in the pound.
However, the report said there was a further claim against the Del Monte
proceeds Holders of Dollars 110m of preference shares issued by Polly Peck
Finance NV claim they rank senior to other creditors and should be fully
repaid with interest, before other creditors. The administrators said they
had been advised that preference holders rank equally with other creditors.
