FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Final stage reached in sale of
BPSM stake
An 80 per cent stake in Portugal's state-owned Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor
(BPSM) will be sold today to one of two rival bidders for at least Es25.6bn
(USDollars 162m), Reuter reports from Lisbon.
Mr Antonio Champalimaud, who owned BPSM before it was nationalised in 1975,
and a consortium led by Portuguese investment bank Banco Finantia have
submitted rival bids which will be opened on the Lisbon stock exchange at
0900 GMT.
If there is a difference of less than 5 per cent between the two bids, both
sides will be given 20 minutes to revise their offers.
The government cleared both proposals after vetoing a lone bid by Banco
Comercial Portugues to buy BPSM when it was first put on sale last year,
saying it was too low.
BPSM is Portugal's sixth largest bank in terms of deposits and seventh
largest in terms of assets, but it has an older than average workforce and
needs to set aside large amounts of cash for its pension fund.
The government is offering 80 per cent of BPSM's 30.5m shares in a single
block to the highest qualified bidder at a reserve price of Es1,050 a share.
The remaining 20 per cent of BPSM's capital will be sold off at a later date
to employees and small investors.
Finantia's consortium includes Swiss Bank Corporation, Portuguese groups
Finantipar-SGPS and RAR-Refinarias de Azucar Reunidas, and Mr Jose Candido
Sotto Mayor Matoso, a relative of the bank's founders.
Mr Champalimaud, who has extensive business interests in Brazil, is bidding
through his Portuguese insurance company Companhia de Seguros Mundial
Confianca.
The government offered BPSM for sale at a minimum price of Es1,050 a share
in June after failing to sell the bank at a reference price of Es1,800 a
share last year.
