  [Text] Pyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- CNN International of 
the United States reported Thursday about the Pyongyang visit of 
former heads of state and government and politicians of 
different countries. 
  It telecast streets of Pyongyang in festive mood, 
Pyongyangites and people on Mansudae Hill. 
  It said Pyongyang seemed to be in a obviously Pacific 
atmosphere with the 82nd birthday of President Kim Il-song being 
celebrated, not to be the capital of a country seeking a war. 
  It also said any tenseness and alertness could not be seen 
in 
the faces of those who gathered on Mansudae Hill to lay bunches 
of flowers before the bronze statue of President Kim Il-song. 
  It noted that faces of people on camera seemed to be easy 
and 
smiling and it was impossible to find out any sign proving that 
their country has been termed as the most dangerous ignition 
point in the world at least. 
  Noting that utterances about a war were exaggerated, it said 
the door of dialogue for a solution to the nuclear crisis was 
still kept open.
