<F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Maroni, the Northern League lower </F>
house floor leader, by Giovanni Negri in Rome; date not given: 
"We Do Not Want To Run Alone"] 
  [Text] Bossi is dividing his time between Milan and Ponte 
di Legno, breathing pure mountain air as he polishes every 
minute detail of his speech for Bologna. On the eve of the 
Bologna convention, Maroni is the official spokesman. 
  [Negri] Ambassador, mediator, weaver of webs: Have they 
promoted you on the field of battle? 
  [Maroni] What a load of rubbish.... That really is not my 
role. 
  [Negri] What have you to say to the followers of the League 
as they make their way to the convention? 
  [Maroni] I tell them to believe in the strategy launched at 
Assago. 
  We have to build up an alliance among forces that are still 
different, to accept the notion that we have to create real 
prospects for the country. The Left is splitting before we have 
even reached election day. We must not be in too great a hurry, 
but we are moving in the direction of an alliance. 
  [Negri] Let us come to the point. Is it to be a lone stand 
against the rest, or an electoral coalition? 
  [Maroni] Splendid isolation is risky. Of course, I do not 
mean this in electoral terms: If we strengthen our identity we 
shall win even more votes. We shall win hands down in the north 
in any case; opinion polls carry no more weight than a badly 
dealt deck of cards. The point is rather that a victory that is 
useful, indeed essential, in turning over a new leaf in Italy is 
better than a landslide that would only open up a rift in the 
country. 
  [Negri] And so has a deal been made with Berlusconi? 
  [Maroni] Very nearly. When we say that he constitutes a 
decisive link between north and south, we think that he performs 
a crucial role. The truth of the matter is that this alliance 
will win the two of us 90 percent of the seats in the north: 
250 deputies and senators, a pole definitely destined for 
government. 
  The crux of the matter is the south: Federalism has 
foundered because the time is not yet ripe. 
  [Negri] For the sake of argument, let us assume you say no 
to 
everyone, and Berlusconi runs on his own in the north. 
  [Maroni] There would be negative consequences. Italy would 
be handed over to the left-wing minorities, indeed to a party 
like the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] that is now down to 
15 percent of the vote. This is not what Berlusconi entered the 
fray to achieve, but he cannot win alone, much less by joining 
forces with Martinazzoli. What will emerge from the election in 
any case is a deep division between north and south: We must 
not stress the differences but reconcile them, and the mediators 
are "Rooting for Italy," the centrists, the secular forces, and 
the promoters of the referenda. All other approaches lead to 
secession, but what we want is federalism. 
  [Negri] That is generous of you. But Fini, too, is winning 
in central and southern Italy. 
  [Maroni] Yes, he is the other half of the equation. But it 
is too early to negotiate with him yet. We must account for 
differences and make our choice, either sanctioning them once 
and for all or maybe coming to an agreement on a joint platform 
in a year or so. Always providing he gets rid of his 
black-shirted goons and his notion of centralist, corporatist 
capitalism and becomes a modern component of a force that 
extends from the right to the liberal left, obviously comprising 
the League, which is a free market, federalist force. 
  [Negri] Fini has said he would like to see Martino as 
minister of the economy. 
  [Maroni] That is highly positive. We, too, have great 
respect for Martino as an economist. 
  [Negri] You have negotiated with Segni and are involved with 
coalition issues. Is the League's door still open? 
  [Maroni] Segni is a star on the wane because he cannot make 
his mind up. He keeps on saying, "we'll see." But time is up, 
and all he can do is put together the Amatos, the La Malfas, and 
the Martinazzolis of this world, in other words those that 
supported Craxi and Andreotti, adding for good measure the 
Pattuellis and Ferris, the idiot grandchildren of the CAF [old 
Craxi-Andreotti-Forlani deal], the yes men who were content with 
the crumbs. No: It is the League that guarantees that certain 
things will never happen again. At the most, Segni will end up 
as the deputy secretary of the PPI [Italian Popular Party]. 
  [Negri] If Occhetto wins, do you really rule out a governing 
coalition with him? 
  [Maroni] Over my dead body. All I give Occhetto is eight out 
of 10 for luck: What he has achieved is certainly not 
attributable to skill. Do you really think someone who cannot 
even impose his leadership on an Adornato or a Ripa di Meana is 
capable of governing Italy? 
  [Negri] Nonprogressive Italy is looking to the League 
convention to find out whether you just want to rule in the 
north or whether you intend to fight to win. What do you expect 
from Bossi? 
  [Maroni] A federalist approach, not a separatist one. A yes 
to alliances and a no to isolation. And a precise prescription 
for how to cross a crucial bridge with the League, the north, 
and the country. I have confidence in him. Although everything 
is in a state of flux, he will make use of one of his greatest 
gifts: his intuition.
