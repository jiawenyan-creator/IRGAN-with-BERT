  [Text] Nanjing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- East China's Jiangsu 
Province will focus on the establishment of a market economy and 
double its gross domestic product, based on last year's figures, 
by the end of this century. 
  "When the goal is accomplished, Jiangsu people will be able 
to live a comparatively comfortable life ahead of schedule," 
Chen Huanyou, governor of the province, said. 
  According to the governor, the province plans to increase 
its 
gross domestic product by 12 percent over last year's figure of 
250 billion yuan; and its imports and exports are planned to 
grow by nine percent to 9.5 billion U.S. dollars this year. 
  The annual income of urban employees is expected to reach 
4,100 yuan per capita, up 16 percent over last year, and that of 
farmers an average 1,450 yuan per capita, up 14 percent. 
  Chen encouraged enterprises to try out the modern enterprise 
system by employing the joint stock operations and forming 
enterprise groups. 
  The private economic sector, he added, will continue to 
surge 
this year. 
  To solve the problem of power shortage, Jiangsu plans to 
install power-generating units with a combined capacity of two 
million kw this year, bringing the total installed capacity in 
the province to 10 million kw. 
  In addition, Jiangsu plans to install more telephone 
exchanges and build more basic industrial enterprises during 
this period.
