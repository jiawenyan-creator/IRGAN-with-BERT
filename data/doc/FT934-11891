FT  29 OCT 93 / Aristide calls for blockade of Haiti
MR Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the exiled president of Haiti, called yesterday
for a total blockade of the country, insisting it was essential to force the
military to give up power.
But in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, he also sounded a
conciliatory note, sending what he termed 'a message of peace to the
officers and men of the army of Haiti' who ousted him from power two years
ago.
Mr Aristide, who was to return to Port-au-Prince tomorrow under the
UN-brokered agreement signed on July 3, promised the Haitian people his
eventual return to office would be followed by sweeping change to end
'institutionalised violence', restore democracy, revamp the economy and
provide jobs for an estimated 70 to 80 per cent of the country's employed
people.
Calling on Haitians rich and poor to 'march hand in hand', he said they
should reject vengeance and 'say yes to reconciliation, yes to justice'.
His proposal of a total blockade is in line with a French plan already
circulating in the UN Security Council that would prevent virtually all
trade with Haiti - regarded as the poorest country in the western
hemisphere, but according to MrAristide, potentially one of the richest.
US, Canadian and French warships began a blockade on October 18 to enforce
an oil and arms embargo after Lt Gen Raoul Cedras, the Haitian military
leader, refused to relinquish power as he had agreed to do in the New York
accords.
George Graham adds from Washington: President Bill Clinton declined to say
what options his administration was considering on Haiti, but warned
military leaders they would be making a 'grave mistake' if they went on
'thwarting democracy's return'.
'If (Port-au-Prince police chief Michel) Francois and the others in Haiti
believe that all they have to do is to wait out Aristide and everything will
somehow be all right, and that the international community will put up with
the re-establishment of a Duvalier-like regime there in plain violation of
the overwhelming majority of the people of Haiti, I think they are just
wrong,' Mr Clinton said.
