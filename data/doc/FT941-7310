FT  25 FEB 94 / People: Non-executive directors
As if he did not have enough to do, Jean Peyrelevade (above), who is
currently working on a plan to recapitalise Credit Lyonnais, the troubled
French bank of which he is chairman, is becoming a non-executive director of
Barings, the UK merchant bank.
Peyrelevade, aged 54, who was chairman of the Union des Assurances de Paris
before being brought in to repair Credit Lyonnais last year, joins Nicholas
Barber, chief executive of the Ocean Group, who is also appointed a
non-executive.
Over the past year Barings has added directors with international experience
to its board to help reinforce its global activities. In September, it took
on Sir William Ryrie, former chief executive of the International Finance
Corporation.
