FT  16 FEB 93 / Arts: Today's Television
For anyone suffering from a surfeit of Morse and Home Counties escapism it
will be a relief to welcome back Taggart, the Glasgow cop who is as gritty
and down to earth as his city. He shares Morse's grumpiness but is miles
more credible. Mark McManus investigates the murder of a policeman's wife,
helped by the personable James Macpherson, in the first of a three parter
starting at 9pm on ITV.
Although health is a national and, presumably, personal obsession it
receives very little television coverage. Pulse , a new series on Channel 4
at 8.30 pm, helps to redress the balance. But it's a bad sign that it has
Emma Freud fronting it rather than an expert .
Dame Edna Everage is used to handing it out, making fools of the famous and
the innocent. She is at last on the receiving end in Without Walls (Channel
4 at 9pm), where impressionist Rory Bremner uses the J'accuse spot to point
out the cruelty which he believes has replaced the wit. This is followed by
a look at the prospects of American child star Macaulay Culkin, who
currently earns USDollars 5m (Pounds 3.5m) a movie.
