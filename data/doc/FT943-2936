FT  16 SEP 94 / Observer: Stooping Lowe
Neil Kinnock, former UK Labour party leader, has lost little time in
stamping something of his personality on to his new job of European
commissioner, which he takes up next January.
For starters, he's beguiled Philip Lowe into becoming his chief of staff. A
47-year-old Yorkshireman, Lowe combines a wicked sense of humour with more
than 20 years' experience of the Brussels bureaucracy. Lowe's current job is
director of the Merger Task Force, vetting Europe-wide mergers and takeovers
on competition grounds. That might easily have led on to Lowe's becoming
director general; clearly, Kinnock has lost none of his persuasive powers.
Moreover, Kinnock has also insisted on having his own press spokesman.
Polite suggestions that the new, expanded 21-member Commission might have to
restrict the number of porte paroles was met with a characteristically Welsh
riposte: if Sir Leon Brittan, the senior UK commissioner, is going to have
his own spokesman, then so too, dammit, is the Right Honourable Neil Gordon
Kinnock.
