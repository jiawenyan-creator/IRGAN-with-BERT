BUSINESSES ASKED TO DONATE GIFTS 
The Gardena Recreation and Human Services Department is seeking donations of 
items for "gift bags" that are given away at an annual Christmas Ball Dance for 
the mentally retarded. 
The bags are filled with gift donated by businesses, but the city is still 
looking for other tax-deductible items, such as discards, small promotional 
gifts or gift certificates. 
For further information, contact Anna Hudson or Kelly Fujio at 217-9541.
