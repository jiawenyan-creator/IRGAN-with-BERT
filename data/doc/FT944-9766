FT  14 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt
Last week, it was the US mid-term elections. This week, it is the open
market committee meeting of the US Federal Reserve.
The first has consequences for the speed of interest rate rises next year,
the second for rates in the immediate future. Both are at the centre of the
German bond market's interest.
The Republican victory in Congress could accelerate the rise in US interest
rates if tax cuts are passed, Mr George Magnus, SG Warburg's chief
economist, told German investors. This would cause the Fed to act faster to
ward off inflation.
'We could then see US interest rates rising more significantly,' he said.
He forecast a further two point rise in the federal funds rate in 1995 after
tomorrow's expected move of half a point or more.
'There is uncertainty over when the Fed will really push rates up into the 7
per cent area - that's effectively where we think they will go.' Real
interest rates are 'much too low' against Germany's and Japan's.
German rates are also expected to move up again next year, says Mr Stefan
Schneider, Warburg's German economist.
With a strong economic recovery and upward wage pressures, 'the Bundesbank
will step on the brakes for the first time early next year'.
