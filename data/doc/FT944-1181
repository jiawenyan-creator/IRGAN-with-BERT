FT  21 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow easier following FOMC
news
Wall Street
US equities fluctuated in negative territory yesterday, showing little
reaction to the Federal Reserve's decision not to raise interest rates at
its open market committee meeting, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 23.55 lower at 3,767.15.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 0.59 at 457.32 and the
American Stock Exchange composite eased 0.43 to 425.30, but the Nasdaq
composite improved 0.62 to 728.51. New York SE volume was a substantial 327m
shares.
The Dow moved up near to Monday's closing level just after a spokesman for
the Federal Reserve said the meeting had adjourned with no announcement, but
proved unable to sustain that level.
Few on Wall Street expected another interest rate increase, but the market
was jittery all morning as investors waited for some official word. There
was some speculation that the Fed might raise rates as much as 50 basis
points. So far this year, the Fed has tightened six times, bringing the rate
to 5 1/2 per cent, from 3 per cent in January.
Reaction was muted to news that the trade deficit for October widened to
Dollars 10.14bn from a revised September figure of Dollars 9.35bn. Although
the trade deficit continues to grow, the October figure was generally in
line with economists' forecasts.
Several important announcements in the high technology sector moved share
prices yesterday. Microsoft, which trades on the Nasdaq, dropped Dollars 3
5/8 to Dollars 59 after the software maker announced that a new computer
operating system may not be available until August of next year.
Intel advanced Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 61 1/4 after the company said it
would replace Pentium chips on demand. Intel shares had been under pressure
in the wake of growing publicity surrounding a flaw in the chip.
Also benefiting from Intel's announcement were computer makers Gateway 2000
and Dell Computer, which are among the primary users of the Pentium chip.
Just after Intel's announcement, Gateway said it would broaden the lifetime
warranty on all of its Pentium-based computers. Its shares were unchanged at
Dollars 22 1/2. Dell was up Dollars 1 at Dollars 38 3/4.
Other technology shares were mixed. Hewlett-Packard rose Dollars 2 1/4 to
Dollars 97 3/8 , while IBM shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 70 3/4 and Apple
Computer dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 38 1/2.
Monsanto fell Dollars 4 to Dollars 68 7/8 after the chemical company agreed
to buy a specialty chemicals business from Merck. An analyst at PaineWebber,
the broking house, downgraded the company, saying the agreement created the
impression that Monsanto was not focusing on cutting costs. Merck put on
Dollars 1/2 at Dollars 38 5/8.
American Depository Receipts of Glaxo Holdings gained Dollars 3/4 at Dollars
20 1/2 after the drugs maker announced that it believed recent Gatt-related
changes to US law would allow for the extension of the patent on its ulcer
drug Zantac in the US. The announcement pushed up Bristol-Myers Squibb,
which also faces uncertainty regarding a patent expiration. The stock rose
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 59 1/2.
Telmex lost nearly 5 per cent after the Mexican government announced that it
was widening the band in which the peso trades against the dollar. ADRs of
the Mexican telephone monopoly fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 46 1/8.
Canada
Golds led a firmer trend in Toronto which lifted the TSE 300 composite index
17.38 to 4,154.13, in spite of continued weakness in New York.
Rising issues outpaced declines by 441 to 374 after volume of 72.3m shares.
Eleven of the 14 sub-indices gained ground, led by communication, gold, real
estate and paper stocks. The metal, oil and pipelines sectors posted
declines. The golds group added 1.42 per cent as the New York spot bullion
price gained USDollars 2.50 at USDollars 382.25 an ounce.
