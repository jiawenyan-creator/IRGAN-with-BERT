CURBSIDE MINISTRIES 
The Church of the Nazarene is reaching out into the South-Central Los Angeles 
community with its "Church on Wheels." The mobile chapel is being used for 
children's Bible classes, puppet shows, Sunday services and inner-city 
ministries. Once a library bookmobile, the van has been outfitted with wooden 
pews that seat up to 35 adults or 50 children.
