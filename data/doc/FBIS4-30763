Soldiers With Slovak Relatives"] 
  [Text] Prague -- Defense Minister Antonin Baudys 
(Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party) wanted 
to verify the reliability of the people working in the Defense 
Ministry and the Czech Army who have family or other ties with 
foreign nationals, including Slovaks, according to RUDE PRAVO's 
information. On 10 November 1993, Baudys set the chief of the 
General Staff the task of guaranteeing the protection of 
official secrets within the Defense Ministry with reference to 
foreign nationals or foreign organizations operating in the 
Defense Ministry and the Czech Army. The order states 
literally: "It is necessary to assess the suitability of 
engaging in their current positions those persons employed or 
serving in the Defense Ministry who are acquainted with official 
secrets and who have family or other active ties with foreign 
nationals, including the Slovak Republic." In particular, the 
aforementioned suitability should have been assessed with regard 
to complying with the purpose of the stipulations contained in 
the Law on Protecting State Secrets and with the government's 
regulations on protecting economic and official secrets. The 
completion date was 31 December 1993. Apart from this, Baudys 
also set the following task: "In the interest of protecting the 
Defense Ministry's activity, it is necessary to notify Military 
Defense Intelligence of persons whose spouse is a foreign 
national or has permanent residence outside the Czech Republic 
or who has active ties with foreign nationals." 
  Five days later -- that is, on 15 November 1993 -- the 
defense minister issued new instructions in connection with this 
order, instructions that contain far more general and moderate 
formulations, but do not contain the two aforementioned passages.
