  [Text] Russian border guard troops will stay in Tajikistan 
for a long time, the commander of border guard troops, 
Colonel-General Andrey Nikolayev told a news conference in 
Dushanbe Thursday [31 March]. 
  He said that maximum attention will be given to providing 
housing and service facilities for them and that the presence in 
Tajikistan of Russian border guard troops is a recognition of 
Russia's strategic interests in the republic, and the interests 
of Russia and Tajikistan, like all CIS countries, lie in the 
security of the Tajik-Afghan border. 
  Nikolayev said that there is no military way for solving the 
problems of Tajikistan. However, the border guard troops on the 
territory of Tajikistan pursue Russia's foreign policy aims. He 
spoke highly of the results of the military council in Dushanbe 
on March 31. He said they had taken decisions to fulfil the 
tasks of the border guard troops and help their interaction with 
the collective peace-keeping forces and the Tajik Defense 
Ministry. He said that all the problems on the agenda were 
solved. 
  Nikolayev said that all citizens of Tajikistan would study 
at 
Russian military colleges and serve within Russian border guard 
troops deployed in Tajikistan. 
  The general said that additional Russian-Kyrgyz check-points 
will be set up to protect the borders of the Gorno-Badakhshan 
Autonomous region. A Kyrgyz battalion has arrived in 
Badakhshan, said Nikolayev.
