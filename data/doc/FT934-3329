FT  09 DEC 93 / Observer: Family squabble
The Sainsbury supermarket clan always has been a broad church but the Sunday
trading vote has opened up an embarrassing rift between David Sainsbury, the
chairman, and his cousin, Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, who was a
director of Sainsbury for over 20 years.
Tim is on the side of the Keep Sunday Special brigade and was planning to
vote against the Shopping Hours Reform Council compromise backed by cousin
David and other big supermarket chains. He's mightily concerned about the
disruption to family life and small shops caused by Sunday trading. Although
it is 10 years since he left the board, Tim's father, a former chairman,
remains one of the joint presidents. Ironically, the spin doctor behind SHRC
is Des Wilson, former Liberal Democrat campaign organiser. His parliamentary
ambitions ended when he was defeated by Tim Sainsbury at the 1973 election.
