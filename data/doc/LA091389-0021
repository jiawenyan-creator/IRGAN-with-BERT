MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO 
Testing the Waters: NBC will conduct a test in October and November to study 
the possibility of changing prime time on the West Coast from the current 8-11 
p.m. to an earlier 7-10 p.m. slot. The move has been requested by some 
affiliates who feel an earlier start would bring heftier ratings. Others oppose 
the change because it would interfere with the placement of their access 
programming. Some syndication companies -- who provide access shows -- also 
frown on the proposal. The results of the study will be made known on Jan. 1.
