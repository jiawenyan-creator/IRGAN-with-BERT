FT  03 DEC 94 / Anger over A-bomb stamp
Japanese politicians reacted angrily yesterday to a plan by the US to issue
postage stamps depicting the explosion of the atomic bomb over Hiroshima.
The US postal service said on Thursday that it would mark the 50th
anniversary of the end of the second world war next year by selling a set of
commemorative stamps, one of which shows a composite image of mushroom
clouds created by the wartime bombings and nuclear tests after the war. The
Japanese government has been angered by the words on the stamp: 'Atomic
bombs hasten war's end.' Mr Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, indicated that
Japan might protest formally to the US about the decision. 'I want to convey
Japanese feelings to the US in some form,' he said yesterday. The chief
cabinet secretary, Mr Kozo Igarashi, said: 'The dropping of the atom bomb
was an historical fact in itself but it also took the lives of more than
300,000 Japanese people.'
