  [Text] The presence of the Japanese Mitsubishi Company in 
Cuba has been confirmed by the presentation and display of its 
automobile products. The Mitsubishi Company has been announced 
as the first Japanese company to establish a long-range business 
deal in Cuba. Present in that investment also is the Sumitomo 
Trading Corporation [name given in English], one of the largest 
automobile companies in Japan. Mitsubishi declared the 
Panamanian company, International Engines, its representative in 
Cuba. This company has been operating in the Cuban automobile 
market for more than 10 years. 
  This is conceived as a short-term investment with an 
immediate impact on the Cuban tourism sector, although the 
Japanese managers have expressed interest in extending their 
investments into other economic areas, and have confirmed their 
confidence in Cuban economic growth. The Cuban party said that 
this investment implies the first economic rapprochement between 
Japan and Cuba.
