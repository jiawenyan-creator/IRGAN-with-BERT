FT  02 APR 92 / Current account deficit falls sharply in Australia
AUSTRALIA'S current account deficit for the year to June is likely to
undershoot the budget estimate of ADollars 14bn (Pounds 6.1bn) following
improvement in the last three months.
The seasonally adjusted deficit fell to ADollars 667m in February, from a
revised ADollars 904m in January and ADollars 767m in December, the
government statistical service said. The deficit in November was ADollars
1.6bn.
The seasonally adjusted deficit for the first eight months of the year was
ADollars 7.45bn, suggesting the full year result may be less than ADollars
12bn, compared with ADollars 15.7bn last year.
In headline terms, the deficit for the first eight months was ADollars 8bn,
an improvement of 34 per cent on the same period last year. Merchandise
exports increased by 7 per cent over the period, while merchandise imports
fell by 1 per cent.
Most private economists said the series of good results removed much of the
risk that the end of Australia's 18-month recession would lead to a surge of
imports and a renewed current account crisis. But some felt the improvement
would be short-lived if the economy grows by 4.75 per cent in 1992-93, as
forecast in a government economic statement in February.
