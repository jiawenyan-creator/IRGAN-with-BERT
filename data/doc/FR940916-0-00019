of by-products on the permit area.

(aa) At KRS 350(27), Kentucky is requiring that a permittee, operator, or person disposing of coal combustion by-products
comply with certain specified environmental performance standards. The performance standards address the handling,
disposal, and placement of the by-products. They include the following requirements: (1) Coal combustion by-products
shall be handled and disposed by the method approved in the permit; (2) disposal areas and facilities used for coal
combustion by-products handling and disposal shall be designed, located, operated, and maintained to assure that
the handling and disposal will not pose a threat to human health or the environment, to minimize disturbances to the
hydrologic balance within the permit area and adjacent area, and to prevent material damage to the hydrologic balance
outside the permit area; (3) to the extent practical, areas to receive coal combustion by-products shall be selected
to minimize water contact with the by-products; (4) the coal combustion by-products shall be placed at least four
feet above the seasonal high-water table, unless the applicant demonstrates that no adverse environmental impacts
will occur; (5) the coal combustion by-products shall not be placed within four feet horizontally of a final highwall,
exposed coal seam, or coal outcrop; (6) the volume of coal combustion by-products disposed of on the permit area shall
not exceed the in-place volume of the marketable coal seams to be removed from the permit area; (7) disposal of coal
combustion by-products shall not result in a greater amount of excess spoil than the amount that would result if disposal
of by-products were not part of the permitted operation; (8) the thickness of coal combustion by-products at any point
in any disposal area shall not exceed forty feet; (9) the Cabinet may reduce the allowable maximum volume or thickness
of coal combustion by-products for a disposal area if it determines that the reduction is necessary to assure protection
of human health and the environment; and (10) after the coal combustion by-products are placed in the disposal area,
they shall be covered as contemporaneously as practicable with at least four feet of nonacid-forming spoil material.

(bb) At KRS 350(28), Kentucky is requiring that the permittee monitor and report the quality of surface and ground
water quarterly, with certain exceptions for water quality parameters which are not normally required to be monitored.
