FT  16 DEC 92 / UK reluctant to enforce no-fly zone
BRITAIN'S Prime Minister John Major expressed reservations yesterday about
military enforcement of the no-fly zone over Bosnia, although he indicated
that the UK would not block such a move by other countries at the United
Nations.
Mr Major said enforcing a no-fly zone might hamper humanitarian efforts and
threaten UK troops. He added: 'We have never ruled out a possible need to
enforce the zone.'
A new UN Security Council resolution is being drafted by France to prevent
by force, if necessary, Serbian flights over Bosnia.
It emerged yesterday that Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, secretary-general of the
UN, had asked Nato to draw up plans for further military action, focusing on
enforcement of the no-fly zone.
Nato military authorities have already been working on what a senior
diplomat called 'limited and fairly specific contingency military planning'
for former Yugoslavia. This work has concentrated on enforcement by aircraft
of the flying ban, possible moves to establish safe areas for Bosnian
Moslems and ways of containing any spread of the conflict into the Serbian
region of Kosovo.
At Westminster some Tory MPs and the Labour leadership called for forceful
intervention. But Mr Major stressed that 'other measures' were under
consideration. Downing Street said these included stronger sanctions and
'international expressions of disgust' at Serbia's actions.
The British reservations were reiterated at a meeting in the margin of the
52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in
Stockholm between Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and his US and
French colleagues, Mr Lawrence Eagleburger and Mr Roland Dumas.
They will, no doubt, be voiced again at a special one-day conference on the
former Yugoslavia in Geneva today, at which Bosnia will be the main item on
the agenda. The conference will be attended by representatives of 29
countries.
