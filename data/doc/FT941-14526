FT  20 JAN 94 / Sales leave house prices flat
Demand from home buyers increased last month but the rise in sales has not
brought a corresponding rise in prices, a survey of more than 100 estate
agents reported yesterday.
The study, by the royal institution of chartered surveyors, reported that 90
per cent of agents in england and wales had seen no increase in prices in
the last three months of last year, compared with the previous three months.
Just under 5 per cent per cent said that prices had continued to fall while
a similar proportion reported increases of 2 per cent over the period.
The institution said that prices had remained flat in spite of an Increase
in house viewings and inquiries from potential purchasers. sellers still
needed to set a realistic asking price to secure a sale.
Confidence among potential buyers had grown as house prices had stabilised
and unemployment figures had improved. the 'upbeat mood' was most pronounced
in the south of england.
One agent in swindon said three houses that had remained unsold for a long
time had been bought by newcomers relocating to the town.
Agents in Newbury, Portsmouth, Bishop's Stortford and Sidmouth reported
similar optimism.
The institution expects the improvement in sales to continue but it warned
that the recovery in prices would be slower.
It said: 'the number of transactions will have to increase before there will
be any meaningful impact on prices, which will rise only slowly throughout
the year.'
