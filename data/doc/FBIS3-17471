  [Text] Riga, Mar 25, BNS -- A Latvian Government 
delegation toured Central Asian countries March 9-23 and signed 
a series of trade cooperation protocols for 1994, said Aivars 
Gulbis, a spokesman for the Economics Ministry. 
  Earlier, Latvia concluded interstate trade agreements with 
Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan which provide that 
concrete yearly supplies are coordinated by annual protocols. 
The procedure is needed because the Central Asian countries 
still practice Soviet-era system of cetralized distribution of 
material resources. 
  Under the protocols, Tajikistan will send Latvia aluminium, 
cotton, tobacco and chemicals while Latvia will deliver radio 
and telephone apparatuses and other consumer goods, said Gulbis. 
  Turkmenistan will supply the Baltic country with cotton, 
wool 
and vegetable oil and receive Latvian mini buses, machinery, 
consumer goods and food stuffs. 
  Latvia will also buy Uzbek metal alloys, zinc and metal 
working facilities. The Uzbek Government plans to increase its 
exports through Latvian ports. 
  In 1993, Latvia's export to Uzbekistan was 0.86 percent of 
the total exports while Uzbek import made up 0.11 percent of the 
total Latvian imports. The Latvian trade balance with 
Turkmenistan was 1.16 percent in export and 0.09 in import, with 
Tajikistan -- 0.15 percent in export and 0.05 percent in import.
