FT  03 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Gordon Brown and Tony Blair to run
for Labour's national executive committee
MR GORDON BROWN and Mr Tony Blair, the twin dauphins of the Labour party,
are to run for the national executive committee - their first electoral test
in the party's national arena.
With nominations for the national executive elections closing today, their
decision to run - undoubtedly taken jointly - will prove an intriguing
measure of their popularity in the country at large and the mood of
activists in the party.
Meanwhile, Labour's women MPs have fiercely denied a report in the Financial
Times that they have informally discussed taking a common stance on the
forthcoming shadow cabinet elections.
A senior party official said leaders of the recently-formed parliamentary
women's group had deliberately avoided any such debate.
In Labour's parliamentary elections at Westminster yesterday, Mr Derek
Foster, the chief whip, comfortably saw off a challenge from Mr John Evans,
an NEC member and MP for St Helens North, by 158 votes to 90.
The first round in the contest for the chairmanship of the parliamentary
Labour party saw Mr Douglas Hoyle, a veteran leftwinger, top the poll with
85 votes.
