FT  02 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Uruguay deal will boost US output
US economic output will be boosted by about Dollars 65bn a year by 2004 as a
result of higher efficiency generated by trade liberalisation agreed in the
Uruguay Round, according to a study by the Washington-based Institute for
International Economics.
The institute says tariff reductions planned in the round will increase US
net exports by Dollars 19.1bn and create 265,000 jobs by 2000.
The authors reject as groundless objections by some members of Congress that
US sovereignty will be undercut by the new World Trade Organisation, which
is due to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on January 1.
Published barely a month before Congress reconvenes for what promises to be
a close vote on ratification of the Uruguay Round, the study will provide
ammunition for the Clinton administration in its efforts to secure approval
of the deal.
The study says that if tariff cuts agreed in the round are phased in over
five years from next year, they will lead to increases of Dollars 41.9bn in
US exports and Dollars 22.7bn in imports by 2000.
US consumers would gain Dollars 11.7bn a year in the same period from lower
prices from reduced tariffs on imports, while US exporters would gain about
Dollars 10.9bn from improved opportunities on foreign markets. US tariff
revenue, meanwhile, would fall by Dollars 11.4bn.
By 2004, tariff cuts, the benefits of planned liberalisation of textile
trade and dynamic economic gains generated by the round should add Dollars
65bn to US output, or roughly 1 per cent of gross domestic product.
The authors say the forecasts are conservative, because they exclude the
effects of planned liberalisation in world agricultural trade and public
procurement, and of possible agreements in the WTO to free international
competition in services.
They say that though the Uruguay Round promises to produce a modest increase
in US employment, its most important result will be to stimulate the
creation of more productive and better paid jobs.
Fears that the WTO will reduce US sovereignty are misplaced, they say,
because the organisation must act by consensus and cannot impose decisions
on the US which conflict with its national laws.
Furthermore, the controversial Section 301 provision of US trade law, which
allows Washington to retaliate against other countries' trade practices when
they fall outside Gatt obligations, is fully consistent with the WTO. The
study warns, however, that once the WTO is set up, its members must act
swiftly to guard against the risk of backsliding into protectionism. The
