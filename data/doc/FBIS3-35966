  [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- Positive changes in the 
Mid-Eastern political life are increasingly feasible, head of 
the Russian Foreign Ministry's Information and Press Department 
Grigoiry Karasin told a briefing here today. 
  The region's policy of peaceful restructuring "gradually 
removes painful aspects of the post-Gulf War inter-Arab 
relations," stressed the diplomat. A proof to it is a recent 
Saudi Arabian meeting of King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz al Sa'ud 
and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat whose ways parted during the 
Iraqi-Kuwaiti crisis. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry believes that "progressing 
Mideastern peace process, including the Palestinian-Israeli 
declaration on principles of Palestinian self-government," gives 
an impetus to Arab rapprochement. 
  Karasin praised the efficiency of recent meetings of Yasir 
'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Oslo and 
Davos, where "another courageous step towards peace in the 
Middle East was made".
