  [Text] The DPRK's purchase of 50,000 tons of rice and its 
plan to buy 2,000 tons of smoked rubber sheets amount to a 
beginning of trade relations between the Thai and DPRK 
Governments. According to Deputy Commerce Minister Churin 
Laksanawisit, the past volume of trade between the two countries 
has been relatively small. He feels that the new trade contacts 
will contribute to greater bilateral trade volume. 
  [Begin Churin recording] I believe there is potential for 
expansion of trade with the DPRK. To date, we import yarn, 
steel pipe, machinery, and chemical products. Our exports to 
that country are gas, gypsum, clothes, auto parts, and so forth. 
There were discussions on rice, tapioca, and natural rubber. A 
couple of days ago the DPRK signed a contract to buy 50,000 tons 
of our 15-percent [broken grain] rice. I just completed a 
discussion on tapioca and natural rubber. The DPRK does not 
know much about uses of tapioca flour. They will probably 
import the flour to process into pellets, to coat textiles, and 
to produce toothpaste, an essential product. The DPRK has been 
using wheat flour and has no experience in the uses of tapioca 
flour. The DPRK official said he is interested in Thai tapioca 
flour. Therefore, it has been agreed that the Commerce Ministry 
will quickly send samples of tapioca flour and relevant 
specifications to the DPRK Government for experimental uses. 
The ministry will then follow up to try to turn the DPRK into 
another market for Thai tapioca flour. [end recording]
