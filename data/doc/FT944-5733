FT  02 DEC 94 / Orange County loses Dollars 1.5bn
The fall in US bond prices this year has cost Orange County, one of the most
prosperous regions of Southern California, around Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds
960m) on paper in investment losses, county treasurer Robert Citron said
yesterday.
The 68-year-old Mr Citron has been an active user of derivative financial
instruments in recent years to increase the county's returns from
investments, a practice that has made him a controversial figure in the
financial markets.
The extent to which derivatives - financial instruments whose value is based
in part on some underlying market factor such as an interest rate or stock -
may have caused or exacerbated Orange county's losses remained unclear
yesterday.
Mr Citron put the losses at around 7 per cent of Orange County's total
investment portfolio, which he said had fallen in value from Dollars 20bn at
the start of the year to Dollars 18.5bn. Earlier this year an official
valued the fund as of the end of March at Dollars 21.7bn.
The county's statement was prompted by feverish rumours of big losses which
swept the US financial markets during yesterday afternoon.
Merrill Lynch, the US's biggest broking firm, was forced to issue a
statement denying it had suffered losses on its dealings with Orange County.
The company confirmed that it had dealings with the local authority, but
said that it hadn't called on the county to make any new cash payments to
cover losses.
Mr Citron, an elected official who fought off a challenge to his position
earlier this year over his use of derivatives, said that his fund's losses
were smaller than those suffered by many big private bond funds this year.
Provided a restructuring plan for the investment fund was completed, 'the
fund will not have to sell securities prematurely at a loss,' he said.
