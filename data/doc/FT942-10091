FT  12 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Own brand look-alikes are 'parasites'
Sir, On Tuesday, the British Producers and Brand Owners Group published
research which shows that consumers feel that distinctive brands are
important and that they are confused by look-alike products.
There is a world of difference between a retailer's own-label and its
look-alike products. Own-label products represent fair competition.
Look-alikes that deliberately assume the characteristics of market-leading
brands are parasites and represent unfair competition.
Retailers operate in a competitive marketplace. They know the value of a
distinctive brand name as well as anyone else. So why do they produce
look-alikes?
Have things become so dire for retailers that they have had to resort to
deception for their sales? The challenge now to retailers is to listen to
the voice of the consumer and package their own products as distinctive
brands in their own right. The question is: will they?
