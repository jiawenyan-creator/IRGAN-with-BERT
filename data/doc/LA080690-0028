POP MUSIC; 
SCOTS' DEBUT REVEALS DEPTH ON THE NILE 
"Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream" -- John Lennon's invitation 
from the '60s -- applies nicely to a trip down the recordings of the Blue Nile. 
But the Los Angeles concert debut of the Scottish group at the Wadsworth 
Theater on Friday proved a surprisingly mind-on affair. 
The strikingly unique, largely electronic textures of the music -- as 
distinctive as, say, Peter Gabriel's -- were quite floatable at the concert, 
warmly and invitingly so. Yet the show was curiously involving. 
In fact, on one level, curiosity played a role: the how-would-they-do-it-live 
factor. The studio work of the trio is so finely sculpted that even given the 
state of technology and the assistance of three augmenting musicians, it was 
fascinating to see it come alive. 
But there was much more to it than that. It's not as if the Blue Nile has, as 
singer Paul Buchanan joked, a "polished stage act." The band's personable 
reserve, and especially Buchanan's endearing nervousness, only added depth to 
the full emotions of the songs and served to draw the appreciative audience 
even more into the music. STEVE HOCHMAN
