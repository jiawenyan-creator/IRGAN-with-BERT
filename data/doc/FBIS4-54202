  [Text] Berlin, May 25 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] denied reports Wednesday that IAEA 
inspectors had taken samples from North Korea's controversial 
5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon. 
  IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said the inspectors had completed 
checking a key radiochemical laboratory, but failed to take 
samples from spent fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor. 
  He said the UN experts had finished additional inspections 
of 
the laboratory last weekend, completing the task of collecting 
samples from the lab that was begun in March. 
  Meanwhile, an IAEA negotiating team began talks with North 
Korean officials to discuss technical issues related to 
witnessing the fuel rod replacement. The negotiations are to 
resume Thursday, but it is uncertain when and how they will end, 
Meyer added. 
  The two-man negotiating team headed by Demitri Perricos, 
IAEA 
safeguards department director, that arrived in Pyongyang 
Tuesday met with the North Koreans Wednesday, meyer said. 
  Of the three inspectors who came to North Korea last 
weekend, 
two were taking part in the negotiations while the third left 
the country for Vienna to report the inspection results to the 
IAEA.
