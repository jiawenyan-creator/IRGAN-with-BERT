Purpose of the Meeting 


The Committee will meet to: 
1_Review and provide advice to the EPA on the October 1994 draft EPA document, Review of the National Ambient Air Quality
Standards for Nitrogen Dioxide: Assessment of Scientific and Technical Information - Draft Staff Paper (this issue
is presently scheduled for the morning session on December 12th). Single copies of this document may be obtained from
Chebryll C. Edwards, Air Quality Strategies and Standards Division, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards
(MD12), U.S. EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. Mrs. Edwards can also be reached by phone at (919) 5415428
or by FAX at (919) 5410237. Written comments on the draft staff paper will be accepted through January 15, 1995.
Comments should be sent to Mrs. Chebryll C. Edwards at the previously stated address. 
2_Discuss EPA plans for development of the document Air Quality Criteria for Airborne Particulate Matter. That document
is being prepared by EPA as part of the process to meet Clean Air Act statutory requirements for the periodic review
and revision, as appropriate, of criteria and National Ambient Air Quality Standard for Particulate Matter. The
process for developing the subject criteria document is described in a draft document entitled Program Work Plan
for Preparation of Air Quality Criteria for Particulate Matter, which will be summarized and discussed at the meeting.
Single copies of the draft Work Plan can be obtained from Ms. Diane Ray, Environmental Criteria and Assessment Office
(MD52), U.S. EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. Ms. Ray can also be reached by phone at 9195413637
or by FAX at 9195411818. In addition, the CASAC will be briefed on the plan for the development of the associated
particulate matter staff paper. Questions concerning the Staff Paper Development Plan should be addressed to Mr.
Eric Smith, Air Quality Strategies and Standards Division (MD15), U.S. EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.
Mr. Smith can also be reached by phone at 9195415135 or by FAX at 9195410237. 
3_Finally, a summary of the EPA's Particulate Matter (PM) Research Strategy for Health Exposure Issues will also
be presented to the Committee. A strategy document has been prepared which briefly describes the problem of concern,
the research mission, the research program goals and objectives, presents a research planning framework, lists
criteria for ranking research and identifies research priorities. The strategy articulated in the document will
be used: (a) To focus EPA's PM research efforts on issues surrounding recent mortality and morbidity observations
associated with PM; (b) to structure and guide EPA's research activities over the next five years; and (c) to communicate
and coordinate with other public and private research organizations and, thereby, help shape a national PM research
agenda. Copies of the strategy document can be obtained from Ms. Diane Ray, Environmental Criteria and Assessment
Office (MD52), U.S. EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. Ms. Ray can also be reached by phone at 9195413637
or by FAX at 9195411818. 
The Committee anticipates a full, formal review of the document Air Quality Criteria for Airborne Particulate Matter
at a meeting in the summer of 1995. Further information on that meeting will be available in early spring 1995. Please
