FT  29 JUL 93 / Performance pay for health service
THE GOVERNMENT is to encourage the wider use of performance-related pay in
the National Health Service, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary,
said yesterday.
Speaking to the Commons health committee she suggested the principle could
be applied to lower earnings categories on a group rather than an individual
basis.
