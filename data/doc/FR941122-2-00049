SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The settling parties are Donivan and Ora Lee Ratliff (the Ratliffs) and Don and Connie Fultz (the Fultzs), former operators
of the Renner Road Shooting Range, also known as Schroeder's Gun Club, which is the subject Superfund Site (the Site).






The Renner Road Shooting Range is located in Shawnee, Kansas in the north-central portion of Johnson County, approximately
12 miles southwest of Kansas City, Missouri. This Site is located in an area experiencing dramatic growth and development
and the tract is expected to be developed for residential use. The 58 acre parcel was used as a gun club from the mid 1950's
to 1976.


The firing of shot guns resulted in lead contamination at the Site. EPA Region VII issued an Action Memorandum on March
18, 1993 for conduct of a time-critical removal action. EPA Region VII began on-site removal activities in the Spring
of 1994. The removal is complete. We excavated approximately 3,600 cubic yards of contaminated soil, solidified
it and transported it off-site to an approved disposal facility. Clean up costs are approximately $1 million.



Region VII issued administrative orders on consent to the Fultzs and the Ratliffs for settlement of their responsibility
through a 

de minimis

 waste contributor settlement. These settlements have been approved by the Department of Justice as required under
section 122(g) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(g) because the response costs in this matter exceed $500,000. The terms of
these settlements require the Fultzs to pay $11,250 and the Ratliffs to pay $30,000. EPA determined these amounts
to be fair shares of liability based on the amount of hazardous substances contributed by each of the settling parties.
These settlements include contribution protection from lawsuits by other potentially responsible parties as provided
for under section 122(g)(5) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(g)(5).



The 

de minimis

 settlements provide that EPA covenants not to sue the Ratliffs or the Fultzs for response costs at the Site or for injunctive
relief pursuant to Sections 106 and 107 of CERCLA and section 7003 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of
1980, as amended (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6973. The settlements contain a reopener clause which nullifies the covenant not
to sue if the parties fail to make the required payments or if any information becomes known to EPA that indicates that
the parties: (1) Conducted or permitted the generation, transportation, storage, treatment or disposal of any hazardous
substance at the Site after the effective date of the order; or (2) that the parties no longer meet the criteria for a


de minimis

 settlement set forth in section 122(g)(1)(A) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(g)(1)(A).



The 

de minimis

 settlements will become effective upon the date which EPA issues a written notice to the parties that the statutory
public comment period has closed and that comments received, if any, do not require modification of or EPA withdrawal
from the settlements.
