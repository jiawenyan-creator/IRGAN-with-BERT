St. Louis Cardinal relief pitcher Todd Worrell will be examined today by Dr. 
Frank Jobe and may require surgery to repair an injured elbow. 
Worrell, 3-5 with a 2.96 earned-run average, would probably miss the remainder 
of the season if he sustained a torn ligament, team spokesman Kip Ingle said. 
If there is only muscular damage, the right-hander would be placed on a 
rehabilitation program and could return in a few weeks, Ingle said.
