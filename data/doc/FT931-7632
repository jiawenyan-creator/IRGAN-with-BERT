FT  23 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen hits new high against Dollars
THE YEN reached a new high against the US dollar yesterday as investors
continued to be heavy buyers of the Japanese currency, writes Peter John.
The rise highlights the dilemma facing the Japanese finance ministry. It
needs to cut the country's trade surplus but fears that the high value of
the yen will hit Japan's export market and domestic economy in the middle of
a recession.
Dealers said the yen reached Y116.10 in early London trading, fell back
slightly as profit-takers moved in and then rose again as the New York
market continued to buy it.
The gains are being fuelled by a belief that the Group of Seven meeting of
finance ministers and central bank governors on Saturday will endorse a
stronger yen as a means to reducing Japan's trade surplus.
Publicly, Japanese finance officials have expressed concern at the speed of
the yen's rise but there was a feeling in the foreign exchange markets that
the comments are principally a sop to hard-pressed exporters.
Mr Rob Loewy, the head of foreign exchange trading at Midland Global
Markets, argued that Japan might be happy to see the Yen trading between
Y115 and Y118 against the dollar.
Mr Neil MacKinnon of Citibank said he could see the dollar falling even
further to reach Y105-Y110 but, he added: 'Previously when there has been
this sort of discussion (among Japanese officials) the ball-park figure was
Y110-Y115.
'I suspect that the squeeze on profit margins plus the downturn in Japan's
export markets might mean that the acceptable pain barrier would be Y115
 Y120 and possibly as low as Y125.'
The yen closed in London at Y116.35 against Y119.0. Its strength added to
pressures on some European currencies.
The arrest of two Fiat executives yesterday in connection with Italy's
political bribery scandal and following hard on the heels of two government
resignations saw the lira sold down to 967.1 against the D-Mark from 959.2.
In spite of efforts by Spain's central bank to prop up the peseta, it
tumbled to Pta73.0 against the D-Mark from Pta71.7.
The fall revived fears that Spain might have to devalue or quit the ERM.
Observers said the country was likely to raise interest rates first but
there was scepticism about Spain's ability to sustain high rates.
The Bank of Portugal also intervened to support its currency but the escudo
buying failed to prevent it sliding some 50 basis points in sympathy with
the peseta to close 92.13 against the D-Mark.
The franc fell to Ffr3.392 from FFr3.385, with some talk of intervention.
However, the country's currency reserves rose by FFr13.09bn in January to
FFr101.05bn leaving the currency more secure against any speculative
attacks.
Away from the ERM, sterling was steady, firming to Dollars 1.4550 from
Dollars 1.4530 but easing to DM2.3700 from DM2.3775.
