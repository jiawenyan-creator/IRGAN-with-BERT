FT  29 JUN 93 / Creditors back plan for Heron
HERON, the property and trading group led by Mr Gerald Ronson (above), won
the support of creditors for its Pounds 1.4bn debt restructuring plan at a
meeting in London yesterday.
There are two further meetings, in the Netherlands and the Netherlands
Antilles, to consider the proposals, but these are expected to follow the
lead of yesterday's vote.
Of those voting, more than 80 per cent by value, and 75 per cent by number,
accepted the proposals. The minimum required was 75 per cent by value and 50
per cent by number.
Heron is also understood to have concluded the restructuring of its US
assets, another condition for the refinancing to go ahead. The schemes need
ratification by the courts in the three jurisdictions, but completion of the
refinancing is expected by the end of July.
At yesterday's meeting Mr Gerald Ronson said that the group could now see
'signs of improvement in the sectors in which our trading businesses
operate'. More than Pounds 150m of property sales had been completed or
agreed in principle at values above those in the group's business plan.
One financier said after the meeting that the disposals would have been
those properties which were easiest to sell. Later sales would be more
critical. 'It is those difficult sales at the margin which make the
difference between the scheme working or not.'
The meeting proved less heated than many had expected.
About 20 creditors attended and of them only one raised questions from the
floor. That was Mr Simon Shane of First Eastern Developments, a Bermudan
property consultant, who spoke through his legal representative.
Mr Gary Klesch, a bond dealer who claimed to represent 10 per cent of the
group's bondholders and had opposed the proposals, did not attend.
