FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Foreign partner welcomed at
GiroCredit
A 10 per cent stake in GiroCredit, Austria's third-largest bank and the
savings banks' clearing institution, will be offered to a foreign partner
later this year through a capital increase.
Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, is due formally to take control of
GiroCredit next month after raising its shareholding from just over 30 per
cent to at least half.
Bayerische Landesbank, a major bank and clearing institution for the
Bavarian savings banks, will be offered first refusal.
