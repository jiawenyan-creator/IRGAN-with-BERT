CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
LOS ANGELES; 
SUSPECT HALTED AFTER GOLF COURSE CHASE 
A routine jog for three Los Angeles police officers turned into a 1 
1/4-mile-long foot, bicycle and golf cart chase that ended with the capture of 
a suspect in an attempted rape, police said Saturday. Alan Sorkness, Charles 
Heim and Gary Morgan were out for a training run in the Sepulveda Dam 
Recreation Area about 4:30 p.m. Friday when a 25-year-old woman crawled from 
thick brush on the side of the jogging path "screaming for help," Sgt. Joseph 
Brazas said. 
The woman told police that she had been jogging when a man dragged her from the 
path and tried to rape her. As the officers spoke to the woman, she spotted the 
suspect 200 feet away and the chase began, Brazas said. They ran into Balboa 
Golf Course, where the officers ran into actor Scott Baio, who loaned them his 
golf cart. One officer also commandeered a bicycle. Both had to be abandoned 
finally because of rough terrain, but the suspect was caught in an open field 
in the undeveloped recreation area, Brazas said. The 16-year-old suspect was 
taken to Sylmar Juvenile Hall on suspicion of attempted rape.
