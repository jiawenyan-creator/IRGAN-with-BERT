FT  14 JUN 93 / People: Non-executives - Clyde Petroleum
Colin Phipps, chairman of Clyde Petroleum, has resigned as a non-executive
director of Budgens, the grocery chain, after two years on the board. The
company says that now it has completed its restructuring phase his job is
over.
Phipps had been appointed as a representative of Gartmore when the then
chairman and chief executive, John Fletcher, was forced out by a group of
institutional investors in May 1991. Gartmore has since disposed of its
shareholding.
Hans Reischl, chief executive of German supermarket chain Rewe, which has
taken a minority stake in Budgens, recently went on to the board in a
non-executive capacity.
