<F P=106> [Report on interview with Minister of Finance Anne Wibble by </F>
Ewa Stenberg; place and date not given: "Journey to Better Times 
Fraught With Danger"] 
  [Text] It would be harmful to cut government spending 
more than the government has proposed, says Minister of Finance 
Anne Wibble, defending herself following Monday's [10 January] 
criticism by the Social Democrats, New Democracy, and the 
business community that the budget deficit is not being reduced 
fast enough. 
  "I am the first to draw attention to the seriousness of the 
state's financial situation, but I don't think it would become 
less serious if we drained the economy completely. What we need 
to do is try to achieve a balanced recovery. We must not create 
additional unemployment unnecessarily, which costs a lot of 
money," Wibble told DAGENS NYHETER. 
  For her big day, the minister of finance wore clothes she 
had 
received as Christmas presents -- cerise blouse, brightly 
colored scarf, and black dress -- in order to deliver a matching 
message: The economy is improving, and Sweden is on the way to 
lifting itself out of the crisis, but extremely high 
unemployment and a big budget deficit are still with us and 
causing the journey to better times to be fraught with danger. 
<H5>  Better Times </H5>
  When Wibble's cheerful message about better times reached 
economists and political opponents, they immediately countered 
it with demands that the government do more in those improved 
times to reduce the budget deficit. 
  But the minister of finance hit back: 
  [Wibble] Stability and confidence in the economic policy are 
increased if the reorganization program is carried out more or 
less according to plan. If we begin grousing too much about what 
the Riksdag has decided, the result will be confusion about what 
is happening. To reduce unemployment we need new jobs, and that 
depends to an extremely high degree on business investments. And 
if there is anything that companies do not like, it is political 
shilly-shallying. In such cases, they do not bother to invest. 
  We do not want to tighten up on the economy just for the fun 
of it, of course; we are tightening up only as much as necessary 
to achieve the goals we have chosen. Economizing does not have 
any intrinsic value. 
  [Stenberg] Isn't there intrinsic value in reducing the 
deficit to a minimum? 
  [Wibble] The budget deficit will decline by 45 billion 
kronor 
between this fiscal year and the next, and that is more than 
most people expected. 
  There are a great many people during a certain period who 
only talk about unemployment being too high and who want to see 
incentives. Then in another situation, it becomes the fashion to 
say that a few more billion kronor must be saved. As minister of 
finance, I must see to it that both things happen at the same 
time. 
<H5>  In Four Years </H5>
  [Stenberg] She emphasizes, however, that she considers it 
conceivable that the program already adopted for strengthening 
state finances by a total of 81 billion kronor can be carried 
out faster than planned -- perhaps in four years rather than 
five. 
  [Wibble] And if the economy goes better than we expected, we 
will be able to save more in the next fiscal year than the plan 
calls for. 
  [Stenberg] Can it be said that the government has the 
economy 
under control when total unemployment is expected to hit 14 
percent this year, and the state will have to borrow 220 billion 
kronor next year to cover expenditures? 
  [Wibble] Our entire policy is aimed at reducing the 
imbalances. We are trying to create more new real jobs and 
gradually whittle away at the reorganization plan as adopted by 
the Riksdag for reducing the budget deficit. We have the 
national debt and the budget deficit under control. 
  [Stenberg] Why will 14 percent of the Swedes who are willing 
and able to work remain outside the ordinary labor market during 
a boom period such as you expect in 1995? 
  [Wibble] Creating more jobs is a slow process. To employ 
more 
people, one must have confidence in the future. That confidence 
is growing now. So people are deciding to expand their 
activities. They will raise money for investment, buy machinery 
or companies, and take care of a number of practical matters. 
Only then will they begin to hire people. For practical reasons, 
it does not happen overnight. 
<H5>  Has Done Everything </H5>
  [Wibble continues] The government has done everything in its 
power to limit unemployment. 
  It is possible that we could have added a few hundred jobs 
in 
some labor market program, although it would have been 
difficult, but the result would not have been any new real jobs. 
  [Stenberg] How does it happen that despite the gigantic 
budget deficit, the government can afford new expenditures? 
  [Wibble] We have different values than the Social Democrats 
do when it comes to what the important priorities are. That is 
why we are choosing to increase certain expenditures while 
reducing others. The important thing is that we should meet the 
requirements of the reorganization plan, and we are doing so. 
  [Stenberg] Wibble is quite convinced that the Riksdag will 
support the proposals in the budget. 
  [Wibble] The opposition has criticized us for not saving 
enough. So they surely ought to support the savings that exist. 
Remember that all the opposition parties will have to stand 
together if they are going to defeat the proposals.
