FT  04 NOV 93 / Germany comes closer to modern infrastructure in markets
Germany came a step closer to introducing a modern regulatory infrastructure
for its financial markets yesterday when the cabinet approved the draft of
the second Financial Markets Promotion Law, writes David Waller from
Frankfurt. The long-awaited new law will make insider dealing a criminal
offence in Germany for the first time, punishing offenders with up to five
years in jail or a fine of up to DM500,000 (Pounds 203,252).
