FT  07 JUL 94 / Argentine protesters call for strike
Organisers of the biggest demonstration held against Argentine President
Carlos Menem's free-market policies yesterday called for a general strike on
August 2 as they rallied in the capital, Buenos Aires.
About 60,000 civil servants, students, farmers and political activists
gathered in the Plaza de Mayo facing the presidential palace for the climax
of the so-called Federal March - a three-day protest bringing busloads of
workers from throughout the country.
Organisers had hoped that the rally, which went off peacefully, would
attract 100,000 protesters.
The protest was called by public sector unions and it attracted both the
hard left and the ultra-nationalist right. It was intended as an attack on
the belt-tightening policies which derailed several provincial
administrations earlier this year, sparking off riots.
President Menem, whose sights are set on re-election next year, criticised
the protest as 'senseless' and said it was 'a direct blow to the country,
not the government'.
