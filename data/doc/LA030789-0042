MORNING REPORT: MUSIC 
Musically and academically gifted students who've had to choose between a 
liberal arts and a conservatory education will now be able to study in both 
worlds through a new joint degree program announced by Juilliard School, 
Columbia University and Barnard College. The three schools have set up a 
cross-registration program that will open individual courses at Juilliard to 
qualified students in the other undergraduate schools, and vice versa. The plan 
will allow students to earn two degrees -- a bachelor of arts in any major and 
a master's degree in music -- in five years rather than six. ALEENE MacMINN
