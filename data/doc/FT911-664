FT  10 MAY 91 / World Trade News: European gear makers prepare a US fighting
fund
EUROPEAN gear manufacturers are mobilising their resources to fend off
likely protectionist moves by the American Gear Manufacturers Association.
Mr Michael Opperman, retiring chairman of the British Gear Association and
president of Eurotrans, which groups together the European manufacturers,
said in Birmingham yesterday that an initial fighting fund of Dollars 50,000
(Pounds 29,000) was being set up to finance lobbying and political activity
in the US.
This would be co-ordinated by Mr Alan Carter, vice-chairman of the British
Gear Association, on behalf of European manufacturers.
The US manufacturers are expected, after a meeting in June, to petition the
Department of Commerce for relief from imports. While it is known that the
American Gear Manufacturers Association will exclude automotive gears from
their petition, it is not clear what relief they will seek.
As a minimum, it is assumed that they will want US government aid for extra
research and training, and an extension of the Buy America policy to cover
all defence expenditure on gears. While Eurotrans would acquiesce if relief
was restricted to these minimum demands, it is bitterly opposed to any wider
protective move or any move which would interfere with gear supplies to the
marine and aerospace industries.
Uncertainty about the intentions of the US stems from the fact that the
American manufacturers are themselves divided on the sort of protection they
should seek. They could demand an agreement with foreign suppliers for
voluntary restraint, the imposition of mandatory quotas or higher import
duties.
US and European manufacturers met in February to discuss the matter, but
apparently did not achieve more than a clearing of the air.
Mr Opperman also held out the possibility of a US anti-dumping action
against Europe. 'There is evidence that some German companies may have been
dumping in America,' he said.
