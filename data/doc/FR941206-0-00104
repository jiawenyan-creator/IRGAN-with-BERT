Final rule; petitions for reconsideration.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In the Second Memorandum Opinion and Order (Second Reconsideration Order), the Commission revises the national
radio ownership limits to permit minority broadcasters to own a controlling interest in up to 25 AM and 25 FM stations,
and to permit non-minority broadcasters to hold a non-controlling interest in an additional five AM and five FM stations
over the general national limits that are controlled by minorities or small businesses. The Commission declines
to revise its local radio ownership limits or its rules and policies regarding time brokerage. The actions taken in
the Second Reconsideration Order, in conjunction with the other actions taken in this proceeding, are needed to permit
radio broadcasters to combine resources, as well as to provide greater opportunities for minority and small business
broadcasters.

Synopsis of Second Reconsideration Order


1. The 

Second Reconsideration Order

 resolves issues raised in three petitions for reconsideration of the 

Memorandum Opinion and Order

 in MM Docket No. 91140, 7 FCC Rcd 6387 (1992), 57 FR 42701 (Sept. 16, 1992) (

First Reconsideration Order

). Those petitions were filed by the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), the National Association of
Black Owned Broadcasters, Inc. and the National Black Media Coalition (NABOB/NBMC), and the Telecommunications
Research and Action Center and the Washington Area Citizens Coalition Interested in Viewers' Constitutional Rights
(TRAC/WACC). The 

Second Reconsideration Order

 also addresses a Petition for Rule Making (RM8414) filed by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB),
and denies a NABOB/NBMC request for stay and rescission of the previous increase in the national ownership rules.
2. The 

First Reconsideration Order,

 upon which the 

Second Reconsideration Order

 is based, revised the Commission rules governing the ownership of interests in multiple radio stations. The 

First Reconsideration Order

 revised 73.3555 of the Commission's Rules (47 CFR 73.3555) to increase the national radio ownership limit
from 12 AM and 12 FM stations to 20 AM and 20 FM stations. The Commission also revised the national minority ownership
cap, which had permitted non-minority owners to take a non-controlling interest in an additional two AM and two FM
stations that were minority-controlled, and permitted minority owners to hold a controlling interest in 14 AM and
14 FM stations. The 

First Reconsideration Order

 modified the rule to permit all owners to take a non-controlling interest in an additional three stations per service
above the national caps if those stations were controlled by minorities or small businesses. It declined to adopt
a provision allowing minority broadcasters to own more stations outright.

3. The 

First Reconsideration Order

 also relaxed the local ownership limit, which had been one AM and one FM station per area, to permit common ownership
of up to two AM and two FM stations, depending on the size of the market. Specifically, in markets with 15 or more stations,
an individual or group was permitted to acquire up to two AM and two FM stations provided that the combined audience
shares of those stations did not exceed 25 percent of the local radio market. In markets with fewer than 15 stations,
a single owner was permitted to acquire a total of three stations, no more than two of which may be in the same service
(

i.e.,

 AM/AM/FM or AM/FM/FM), provided that the group owner's stations represent less than half of the total number of stations
in the market. The 

First Reconsideration Order

 also declined to revisit the Commission's prior determination that certain time brokerage arrangements would be
treated as attributable ownership interests for purposes of the multiple ownership rules.
