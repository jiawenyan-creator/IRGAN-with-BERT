SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 201(s) and 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 321(s) and 348(b)(5)) and the
regulations for affirmation of GRAS status in 170.35 (21 CFR 170.35), notice is given that Stepan Co., 100 West
Hunter Ave., Maywood, NJ 07607, has filed a petition (GRASP 4G0409) proposing that a medium chain triglyceride containing
caprylic and capric acids be affirmed as GRAS for use in food as a direct human food ingredient. The petitioner proposes
that captrin be the common or usual name for this triglyceride. 


The petition has been placed on display at the Dockets Management Branch (address above).
Any petition that meets the requirements outlined in 170.30 (21 CFR 170.30) and 170.35 is filed by the
agency. There is no prefiling review of the adequacy of data to support a GRAS conclusion. Thus, the filing of a petition
for GRAS affirmation should not be interpreted as a preliminary indication of suitability for GRAS affirmation.
The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. If the agency finds that an environmental impact
statement is not required and this petition results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding
of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c).
Interested persons may, on or before October 4, 1994, review the petition and file comments with the Dockets Management
Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments should be filed and should be identified with the docket number
found in brackets in the heading of this document. Comments should include any available information that would be
helpful in determining whether captrin is, or is not, GRAS for the proposed use. In addition, consistent with the regulations
promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency encourages public participation
by review of and comment on the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice.
A copy of the petition (including the environmental assessment) and received comments may be seen in the Dockets Management
Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
