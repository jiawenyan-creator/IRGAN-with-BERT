FT  16 APR 93 / Kenyans suspend operations of leading local bank
KENYA HAS suspended operations of a leading local bank hit by severe cash
problems and arrested several of its officials, the state-run Kenya News
Agency said yesterday.
The agency quoted Mr Musalia Mudavadi, the finance minister, as saying the
central bank had taken over the affairs of the Trade Bank of Kenya pending
further investigations.
In a statement last month the minister denied allegations that several banks
had been allowed by the central bank to run up overdrafts because of their
connections with the political establishment.
Mr Mudavadi acknowledged that a 'few banks have run overdrafts with the
Central Bank,' but he stressed that they were not insolvent.
Yesterday Mr Mudavadi told the Kenyan parliament that 'auditors appointed to
the bank had reported liquidity constraints, poor asset quality, weak
internal controls and violations of the banking act.'
He said that a manager from the Central Bank had been appointed to run the
trade bank, owned by a group of powerful local Asians 'in order to protect
depositors and creditors and restore public confidence,' Kenya News Agency
reported.
It said several trade bank officials had been arrested. The Asian managing
director was being sought.
An opposition member of parliament told the house on Wednesday that the
central bank was forced to loan the trade bank up to Sh1.6bn (Pounds 23m) to
enable the bank to pay off its debts.
The bank was set up in 1984 with a paid-up capital of Sh230m. It listed cash
reserves of up to Sh212m in February this year.
