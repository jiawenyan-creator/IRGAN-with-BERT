FT  15 OCT 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Home cooking in soup kitchens
The increasing consumer demand for fresh foods has spurred Geest, the banana
company, to license a fresh soup-making technology from Stock Pot Soups of
Seattle.
At the heart of the technique is a return to the way soups are made in the
home - but on a massive scale. Trained chefs use vast cauldrons in which to
mix the meat and vegetables, held together in a classic roux.
A technical difficulty has been to transfer the soup into the stand-up
plastic pouches without pulverising the ingredients. To do this a valve has
been incorporated into the cauldron and the pouches, designed to withstand
the heat, are brought to the cauldron rather than the soup being squeezed
through a conventional production line process. The Fresh Soup Company, in
Spalding, Lincolnshire, will make the soups. The Fresh Soup Company: UK,
