FT  05 DEC 94 / World car sales record in sight
World new car sales will set a record in 1995 for the second year running as
some big markets move firmly into recovery, consultants DRI/McGraw-Hill
forecast in their latest annual report on the world car industry. World
sales this year, at 35m, will be 6 per cent higher than in 1993, when sales
hit a six-year low of 33.1m, the report* predicts. They are projected to
rise by a further 4 per cent in 1995, to 36.45m units.
However the overall figures disguise wide variations between markets, with
Latin America and much of the Asia-Pacific region booming but western Europe
still struggling to pull itself out of recession and no real sign of
recovery in Japan. The report expects sales in western Europe to rise by 5
per cent this year, to 12m units but the rate of growth will slow to around
4 per cent next year before recovering in 1996. In percentage terms, the
most spectacular growth comes from Asia-Pacific countries outside Japan. New
car sales in China are forecast to jump by 28.6 per cent next year, to
758,000, and to top 1m before the end of the decade.
