  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Akira Yamagishi, chairman 
of the eight-million-strong Japanese Trade Union Confederation 
(Rengo), on Thursday [28 April] suggested that his organization 
will keep a distance from the new coalition government formed by 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  Yamagishi called it "regrettable" that the new coalition 
failed to maintain the framework as it existed under former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  He said that Rengo, which had cooperated with the Hosokawa 
cabinet, would point out rights and wrongs as it sees them in 
assessing the policies of the Hata cabinet. 
  Rengo is Japan's largest federation of trade unions.
