  [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev fears North Korea may soon get its own A-bomb and 
said the issue is of "a principle importance for Russia and the 
United States". 
  "Evidently, North Korea has no nuclear bomb at present, but 
it can be created in the near future. The production of a 
nuclear bomb is no problem for a centralised economy which has a 
plutonium- producing nuclear reactor", he told Russian mass 
media chiefs on Tuesday. 
  "If we close our eyes on the North Korean attempts to get 
nuclear weapons, this would serve as an example for other states 
with a nuclear potential", Kozyrev said and mentioned South 
Korea and Japan, in particular. 
  "It is known that the West resorts to hidden sanctions 
against such countries as it happened with Ukraine during the 
signing of a cooperation agreement with the European Union", he 
said. 
  The Russian foreign minister made it understood that the 
recent tensions in Russian-US diplomatic relations which emerged 
after Washington, contrary to bilateral agreements, distributed 
its unilateral UN Security Council draft resolution on sanctions 
against Pyongyang, have been eliminated. 
  He said Russia and the United States have begun to draft a 
completely new joint document which will be ready by Wednesday 
or Thursday. 
  Kozyrev also said that his US counterpart had forwarded a 
detailed outline of the report of former US President James 
Carter who had met the North Korean president.
