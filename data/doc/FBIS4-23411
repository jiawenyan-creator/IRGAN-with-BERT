  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama wants a secret deal with Frelimo 
[Mozambique Liberation Front]. The Renamo [Mozambique National 
Resistance] president favors a government of national unity and 
is now proposing a deal with the Maputo government, an agreement 
that will only be made public after the elections: 
  [Begin Dhlakama recording] I would like to be able to 
convince my brother President Chissano to make a small 
pact--that does not need publicity. Under this pact we could 
agree that, should a particular party win the elections, and 
should the others have only 15 or 20 percent of the votes, they 
could still have certain ministries allocated to them in the 
future government. [end recording] 
  That was Afonso Dhlakama speaking to us following a meeting 
today with the UN secretary general. Butrus-Ghali promised the 
Renamo leader that the UN forces will stay in Mozambique until 
the new goverment is sworn in.
