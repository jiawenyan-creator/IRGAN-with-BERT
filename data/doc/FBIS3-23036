  [Text] Ankara, Feb 17 (AA) -- Iranian Embassy in Ankara 
denied on Thursday that one of the outlawed separatist terrorist 
PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization leaders, Osman 
Ocalan, was in Iran. 
  Several Turkish newspapers earlier said Osman Ocalan was in 
Iran, and Turkey and Iran were bargaining on his return. 
  The embassy in a written statement said several secret 
forces 
aimed at spoiling the two countries' relations.
