FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Lisbon lifts privatisation
restrictions on foreigners
Portugal will not impose any restrictions on foreign participation in future
privatisations but the limit on foreign ownership of most previously
privatised companies will remain at 25 per cent, according to government
officials.
Until now, Portugal has limited foreign investment in most privatised
companies to between 5 and 30 per cent, in contravention of European Union
rules that prohibit any barriers to corporate ownership between member
states.
Mr Antonio de Sousa, Portugal's secretary of state for finance, travelled to
Brussels this week to inform Mr Henning Christophersen, European
Commissioner for economic affairs, that Portugal would drop all limits on
foreign participation in future privatisations.
Mr de Sousa said that Portuguese legislation approved last month also
extended the limit on foreign investment in previously privatised companies
to 25 per cent in cases where the restrictions had previously been lower.
This limit will not be lifted in the near future, he made clear.
Portugal's controversial limits on foreign investment have been highlighted
by the case of Banesto, the troubled Spanish bank, which directly and
indirectly controls 50 per cent of the capital of Banco Totta e Acores
(BTA), the first Portuguese bank to be privatised in 1989.
Portuguese law limits foreign ownership of BTA to 25 per cent.
