MINORITY GAINS LIMITED IN L.A. BUSING PROGRAM; 
INTEGRATION: ACHIEVEMENT SUFFERS IN COMPARISON TO OTHER STUDENTS. GAP 'WIDE AND 
PERSISTENT,' OFFICIAL SAYS. 
More than 20 years after the Los Angeles Unified School District began its 
original busing program to integrate schools, the minority pupils in that 
program are doing little or no better than the students they leave behind in 
segregated schools, and much worse than their white classmates. 
Nine years of district evaluations reveal that children bused under the 
voluntary program have lower reading and math scores than the neighborhood 
students sitting beside them. They go on to college at lower rates. Teachers 
expect less from them. And they suffer low self-esteem. 
District officials are aware of the disparity, but little has been done to 
improve the academic performance of the 13,000 minority students bused under 
the plan, called Permits With Transportation (PWT) -- one of several busing 
programs the district maintains. 
PWT "was never meant to be an academic improvement program," contends school 
Supt. Leonard Britton. "We said we would provide an integrated experience for 
the children, not necessarily an improved education. But in the back of some 
people's minds was the thought that great things would happen if they put their 
children on the bus." 
Admits school board President Jackie Goldberg: "We have not shown great 
leadership. We have to be able to say something more than, 'Oh God, the scores 
are low again,' which has traditionally been our response." 
Over the years, thousands of minority parents who sought the promise of a 
better education signed up for the program, which allowed their children to 
attend schools made up predominantly of other races or ethnic groups. 
Patsy Boston, like many parents, expected great things when she signed her 
daughter up to travel from South-Central Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley 
seven years ago. "I wanted her to experience different cultures and other 
environments . . . but mostly, I wanted her to get a better education, and I 
believed the Valley schools were better." 
Now, she says, after watching her daughter's grades drop and her attitude turn 
sour, she plans to pull the 13-year-old out of the program and return her to 
their neighborhood high school next fall. 
"Why should I put her through all this?" she said. "To go someplace where she's 
not wanted and they don't care whether she succeeds or fails?" 
Since the district began evaluating the program in 1981, the achievement gap 
between PWT students and their suburban counterparts has remained "wide and 
persistent," according to Winston Doby, UCLA's vice chancellor, who reviews the 
program for the district each year. 
While students bused to magnet schools under the district's other voluntary 
busing program perform above the district average, PWT students "appear to 
complete first grade achieving below districtwide norms and never manage to 
catch up," Doby's report two years ago warned. "The district must seriously 
reconsider its approach to educating these students." 
But the PWT program has been a linchpin in the system's court-approved 
voluntary desegregation plan since mandatory busing was stopped in 1981, and 
any major changes might mean the district would have to go back to court. 
This "is the only program that desegregates white schools," explained attorney 
Peter James, who heads the district's desegregation legal team. Other district 
busing programs relieve overcrowding or serve integrated schools. 
PWT "was intended to reduce segregation within the district, and it's working 
as well as anything we've got," he said. "The achievement results have not been 
what we've hoped, but it is desegregating." 
Or, as Doby explained in a report on PWT several years ago: "The treatment is 
successful, but the patients are still dying." 
Britton acknowledges that while the students are "not doing any worse than they 
would have in their home schools, they're not doing any better" than if they'd 
skipped the long bus rides and stayed in their own neighborhoods. 
The district has poured millions of dollars into those low-achieving, 
inner-city schools -- lowering class sizes, adding preschool programs that give 
youngsters a better academic foundation and teaching parents how to help their 
children succeed in school. 
Conversely, most of the West Side and San Fernando Valley schools that receive 
PWT students get only an additional $50 per year per bused student -- an amount 
unchanged since 1981. 
"We don't do much at a (receiving) school for PWT students," concedes Britton. 
"We don't provide much of anything. So much depends on the attitudes and the 
individuals at those schools." 
Although the educational experts who have reviewed the PWT program have 
recommended several specific support services -- such as weekend and evening 
tutorials, teacher training, peer counseling and in-class tutoring -- receiver 
schools spend about 90% of their integration funds to hire classroom aides. 
And while the district monitors those schools to make sure each has a plan to 
educate the students, no one evaluates a school's success or failure to 
adequately perform the task. 
Goldberg said that must change. The board plans to begin hearings on its 
integration programs this summer, and Goldberg said schools should be given 
guidance and adequate support services, then held accountable for producing 
results. 
Until now, there has been little pressure on the board or district officials to 
improve the academic performance of PWT students. 
Because the board did not conduct public hearings on the program until this 
year, parents have not realized that the academic failings were so serious or 
widespread. And it has been hard for district officials "to single this out in 
a district that's facing so many other problems," Britton said. 
Indeed, the problems of the PWT students seem to pale beside those of the 
25,000 minority children -- many newcomers to the country who speak little or 
no English -- who are involuntarily bused to relieve overcrowding in their 
neighborhood schools, and score lowest of all the district's pupils. 
They disappear in the glow over the success of the 98-school magnet program, 
which provides enriched, specialized curriculum to about 28,000 students, who 
consistently score above district and national norms on achievement tests. 
"PWT has been ignored," contends board member Rita Walters, who represents the 
South-Central Los Angeles area that provides many of the program's students. "I 
think it's been viewed as something that has to be tolerated, but the things 
that need to be done to make it a successful program as far as achievement goes 
have never occurred." 
The program was started in the mid-1960s by a handful of black parents who got 
permission to transfer their children from their neighborhood elementary 
schools to virtually all-white West Side schools. The parents provided their 
own transportation until 1968, when the district agreed to bus the 550 
participating students. 
At its peak in 1984, about 23,000 PWT students were bused each day. The program 
pairs minority schools with integrated receiving schools so that groups of 
neighborhood children travel together to their new schools. 
The program initially appealed to middle-class black families, eager to expand 
their children's horizons beyond their mostly black neighborhoods. But as the 
black population in the district dwindled and magnet schools siphoned off many 
potential students, the program has shrunk and become more popular among Latino 
and lower-income black families. Few white students ever have participated. 
Many parents say they selected PWT because they believed schools on the West 
Side and in the Valley were safer and better, with more experienced teachers, 
broader course offerings, more rigorous college preparation programs and fewer 
gang and crime problems. 
"Now, a lot of us are wondering whether it's worth it," said Gloria Jenkins, a 
Windsor Hills mother whose twin sons were bused to a West Side elementary and 
junior high until one was kicked out for disciplinary problems this spring. He 
now attends an all-black private school, where he is thriving socially and 
academically -- scoring several points higher than before on standardized 
tests, she said. 
Parents tell stories of children worn out by long bus rides, frustrated by the 
sense of not belonging in their adopted schools and embittered by what they 
feel is racist treatment in the receiving schools and communities. 
"My children never heard (racial slurs) until they went to the West Side," 
Jenkins said. "As a parent, you feel that you constantly have to be on guard to 
protect them . . . and make sure they get educated like everyone else, and 
that's very hard to do when you're 40 miles away." 
Interviews with students and teachers and reviews of data in the district's 
evaluations of its integration programs bear some of that out. 
PWT students wind up in remedial classes more often than resident students and 
are less likely to take advanced courses or participate in extracurricular and 
leadership activities. 
White students at some schools told district interviewers that although their 
black and Latino classmates "are fine as individuals," the minority students 
were frightening and "intimidating" when they congregated in groups. 
Teachers had lower expectations for their black and Latino pupils and believed 
that white and Asian students from the neighborhood were favored because they 
dominate the gifted classes and their parents are more involved in the schools. 
"I wouldn't say the teachers set out to treat (PWT students) differently, but 
it's a tough situation on both sides," explained Brenda Creed, dean for 
traveling students at Taft High School, the district's largest receiver school, 
with almost one third of its 2,800 students on the PWT program. 
Many suburban teachers have been at their schools for 10 years or more and 
remember a time when schools such as Taft were almost all white and 
upper-middle class, Creed said. It has been difficult for some to adjust to the 
changing demographics and needs of their new student population. 
PWT students are handicapped by the physical rigors of the long bus rides they 
must endure and are sometimes late for class or not as well prepared as 
neighborhood students, Creed said. "Some teachers are quick to bounce (PWT 
students) out of class" when there's a problem. "Some are not real sympathetic 
to all these kids have to go through." 
But despite the busing program's academic failings, there are some success 
stories. 
There are Valley high school valedictorians who are bused from inner-city 
neighborhoods. There are friendships between white and minority students that 
transcend the differences and enlarge the vistas of both. 
"It's given my son an opportunity to learn some things I could never teach 
him," said Jay Berger, a white parent whose son attends a Canoga Park 
elementary school with many bused-in students. "He's more aware and connected 
to the world than a kid who grows up isolated in this artificial white, 
middle-class community." 
And parents such as Jenkins and Boston believe that their children will be 
better equipped for success because of their PWT experiences. 
"I'm not sorry I sent them," Jenkins says of her two sons. "They experienced 
things they never would have experienced in their neighborhood schools. They 
went to private parties, bar mitzvahs . . . things that exposed them to 
different ways of life. They went scuba diving, and on a trip to Catalina 
Island for the weekend. I think they'll value that all their lives." 
The reasons for the poor academic performance of PWT students are complicated, 
district officials and educational experts say. But the barriers posed by the 
integration process -- the long bus rides and lack of opportunity for parental 
involvement -- contribute mightily. 
Some schools, such as Taft, work hard to maximize the involvement of PWT 
parents, holding night meetings in the neighborhoods their children are bused 
from and calling parents immediately when traveling students miss school or 
have problems. 
But the distance between the school and the community makes it difficult for 
all but the most determined parents to participate, particularly for low-income 
parents, who may not have the transportation, child care or free time. 
"It makes a big difference when you can just walk down the street to your 
child's school to talk with a teacher and visit a classroom, rather than having 
to take a day to drive" across town, said Pam Bruns, a Pacific Palisades parent 
who has been active in support of busing programs that have paired her 
neighborhood schools with minority schools. 
Studies nationwide have identified parental involvement as a key element in 
raising student achievement, but the Los Angeles district has done little to 
make it easier for parents of traveling students to have a voice in their 
schools. 
Schools provide buses to get parents to campus on special occasions, such as 
Back to School night, but there is little opportunity for regular interaction 
between the inner-city parents and their children's suburban schools. 
But the root of the achievement disparity between bused children and their 
neighborhood classmates undoubtably lies in the economic differences between 
the groups, experts and district officials say. 
National studies have consistently demonstrated a correlation between 
socioeconomic status and school achievement, and systematic -- and often 
expensive -- intervention usually is needed to break the cycle of low 
achievement among low-income students. 
Low-income students generally have parents who are not well-educated and cannot 
provide the kinds of support or resources, such as reference material or help 
with homework, that middle-income families provide their children. 
The children's language skills often lag far behind their middle-class 
counterparts, because a foreign language or non-standard English is spoken in 
the home. 
And their families are likely to be larger and crowded into small homes or 
apartments. Basic needs, such as a quiet place and time to do homework, often 
are lacking for poor students. 
But programs to overcome those problems would require lots of money, and that 
is in short supply in a district struggling to cut educational programs to 
eliminate an expected $220-million shortfall this year. 
The board is discussing a plan to divert about $1.5 million of the more than 
$93 million the district spends busing students to fund support services such 
as supplemental language instruction and after-school study halls at receiving 
schools. 
But even that will be only a drop in the bucket, since more than 60,000 
students are being bused on the district's various integration programs. 
TEST SCORES FOR BUSED STUDENTS 
The Los Angeles Unified School District uses the national, standardized 
Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (CTBS) to measure student achievement. 
Scores are expressed in relation to the performance of all students tested 
nationwide. For example, a student ranking in the 65th percentile has scored at 
or above the level of 65% of the students taking the test nationwide. 
The chart lists the 1988-89 percentile rankings on the CTBS reading, language 
and mathematics tests of students bused to integrated schools under the PWT 
program, neighborhood students attending schools that receive PWT students, 
students attending predominantly minority schools, and all students in the 
district.
