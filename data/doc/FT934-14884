FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Gloucester Steam plans to raise Pounds 0.4m
ONE OF Britain's leading steam railways has launched a rights issue to
finance the re-opening of a former British Rail service.
Gloucester and Warwickshire Steam Rail, the privately-owned railway company,
aims to raise Pounds 400,000 from the issue, which is targeted mainly at
enthusiasts.
The shares, priced at Pounds 1 each, will not be available in blocks of less
than Pounds 20. The proceeds will be used to fund the first stage of a
Pounds 1m scheme to reopen the 23-mile Honeybourne Line between
Stratford-upon-Avon and Cheltenham.
The line, originally built by the Great Western Railway, was closed 14 years
ago because of falling passenger numbers.
If the project is successful, the company expects the line - part of which
it already operates between Toddington and Gretton in Gloucestershire - to
attract tourists and possibly commuters on the cross-country route.
Mr David Mee, commercial manager, said: 'Once we have extended it south into
Cheltenham we hope the extra revenue from the line will finance the route
north through Broadway into Stratford.
'We will eventually have 23 miles of track and one of the longest private
railway lines in Britain.'
