ARIANE TO CARRY TWO SATELLITES ALOFT JULY 25 
A European Ariane rocket carrying two satellites will be launched July 25, the 
first since an Ariane exploded in February, Arianespace said Thursday. 
The July launch, like the ill-fated one earlier this year, will be from the 
European space base at Kourou, French Guiana, on South America's northeast 
coast, the space group said. 
The mission will launch a TDF 2 French television broadcasting satellite and a 
DFS 2 Kopernikus German postal service satellite.
