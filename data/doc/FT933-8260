FT  17 AUG 93 / People: Harris - support for Terminal Five
Brian Harris, who stepped down from the chairmanship of international
property consultants Richard Ellis in May, is to become the first chairman
of the Heathrow Airport Support Group, set up by the London Chamber of
Commerce and Industry and the Geneva-based Air Transport Action Group to
support the creation of a fifth terminal at the world's largest
international airport. A public enquiry is scheduled for next year, and
Harris expects the group to be active for at least five years.
Harris, 61, who lives under the Gatwick flightpath and hence claims to know
'a little' about aircraft noise, says it was thought sensible that the job
should be performed by someone unconnected with airlines or businesses
associated with the airport. He is currently serving the second of two years
as president of the London Chamber of Commerce.
A graduate of London University, Harris went straight to Richard Ellis. He
became chairman in 1984, and still remains a full-time partner.
He is also on the board of the London First intitiative inspired by Sir
Allen Sheppard.
