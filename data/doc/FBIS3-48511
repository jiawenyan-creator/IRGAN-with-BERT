  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 24 (YONHAP) -- The Science and 
Technology Ministry will invite nearly 100 distinguished Korean 
or foreign scientists from abroad to visit Korea this year to 
teach Koreans advanced science and develop standards, a ministry 
spokesman said Monday. Korea has difficulties because advanced 
countries are reluctant to transfer sophisticated technologies 
for fear of the so-called boomerang effect. The ministry will 
invite scientists with doctorates and more than five years of 
research experience, but will waive its standards for scientists 
with remarkable achievements on a global scale. 
  The scientists will be given air fares, moving costs in 
addition to their salaries, which are higher than they are 
receiving in their countries of residence. The ministry hopes 
to develop the level of science and research under momentum of 
internationalization, the spokesman said.
