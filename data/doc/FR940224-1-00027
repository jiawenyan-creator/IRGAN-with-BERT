 

On the other hand, EPA is proposing to grant registration to ``registrable'' F/FAs upon the manufacturer's submittal
of the basic registration application and other pre-Tier 1 notification requirements (see NPRM)

. Once registered, these products would be legally able to enter the market. Furthermore, these products would have
the same testing and compliance requirements as those specified for currently registered products, i.e., three
years from the date of promulgation for the completion of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements and, if Tier 3 testing were
prescribed, additional time consistent with the incremental testing requirements. Manufacturers' compliance
with these requirements could be accomplished independently or as a member of an existing group.

Even if an unregistered F/FA were ``registrable'', however, EPA could invoke other available regulatory authority
under Federal law to prevent its commerical distribution if EPA were to determine that such action was necessary to
protect the public health or welfare. For example, applicable sections of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)(15
U.S.C. section 2601 

et seq.

), such as the Significant New Use rule or the Premanufacturing Notification process, could be invoked to require
health effects testing prior to commerical distribution of an F/FA product if, among other factors specified in TSCA,
there is a change in the use of the product or an increase in the magnitude and/or duration of exposure to the product
by human beings or the environment (15 U.S.C. section 2601 (a)(2)).

EPA believes that the proposed distinctions between registrable and new F/FAs, both in terms of their definitions
and their respective compliance requirements, reflect reasonable regard for the public health and welfare without
undue interference in the F/FA marketplace. Because registrable F/FAs are defined such that they must be reasonably
similar in composition and usage to current F/FAs, their entry onto the market would generally not be expected to increase
the health or welfare risks potentially related to current F/FA emission exposures. In determining whether a manufacturer's
product is registrable, the omission of aftermarket additives from the relevant population of currently registered
F/FAs is intended to prevent a potentially large increase in public exposure to generally untested products which
had previously been relatively limited in distribution and usage. It also ensures that the ability to group with a
``grandfathered'' aftermarket additive would not confer ``registrability'' on an unregistered F/FA. This is consistent
with the congressional intent in CAA section 211(f)(1)(B) to preclude introduction into commerce of new aftermarket
additives which do not fit the ``substantially similar'' criteria. The omission of F/FAs in different fuel families
from the relevant population of current F/FAs is also intended to prevent potential increases in exposure to untested
products. Expanding the use of an additive from one fuel family to another (e.g., from diesel fuel to gasoline) would
significantly increase the overall size of the potential market for the product and thus the potential exposure to
its emissions. 
Because of these safeguards, EPA believes that additional protection to the public health would generally not be
achieved by prohibiting registrable F/FAs from entering the market while testing of these products (or groups of
similar products) proceeds. In the case of ``new'' F/FAs, however, EPA has no such assurances. By definition, these
F/FAs would be dissimilar in composition and/or usage to currently registered products, and allowing their introduction
could not reasonably be assumed to have no adverse effects on the health or welfare of the general population. For these
F/FAs, therefore, EPA believes that it must protect the public health and welfare by requiring compliance with all
data requests it deems necessary before exposing the public to potentially increased risk. 
Figure 1 summarizes the decision process for determining whether an unregistered F/FA product would be ``registrable''
(and thus handled much like a currently registered product), or whether an unregistered F/FA product would not be
``registrable'' and must complete all testing requirements before registration is granted.

As a result of these modifications to the original proposal, EPA would have an opportunity to evaluate fully the potential
health effects of truly new products before they enter the marketplace. On the other hand, F/FAs similar to those already
registered would not be arbitrarily kept from the market during the compliance period simply because of the relationship
between their date of introduction and the effective date of this rule. 
EPA interprets section 211(e) to support the approach contained in this notice. EPA believes that the reference in
CAA section 211(e)(2) (A) and (B) to a ``fuel or fuel additive which is registered'' or ``which is not registered''
is ambiguous as to whether it refers to the F/FA generally or to a particular product-specific registration. Given
this ambiguity, EPA believes that it is reasonable to interpret the phrase ``fuel or fuel additive which is registered''
to refer to the F/FAs generally. Further, EPA believes it is reasonable to interpret the phrase ``registered'' to
include both F/FAs that are either ``registered'' or ``registrable.'' ``Registrable'' F/FAs are sufficiently
similar in composition and use to existing F/FAs that one would not expect them to have dissimilar health effects;
and therefore, it is reasonable to interpret the phrase ``registered fuel or fuel additive'' to include not only those
F/FAs that are identical, but also those that can group with existing F/FAs.
