SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that a public meeting will be held to discuss testing procedures
to demonstrate that an over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreen drug product protects users from ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation.
FDA is holding this meeting after considering public comments regarding UVA claims and testing procedures received
in response to the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking and letters sent by the agency. In addition, FDA is reopening
the administrative record for the proposed rulemaking for OTC sunscreen drug products to allow comment on matters
considered at the meeting. FDA intends to invite guests and consultants to address technical matters related to the
questions listed in this document. This meeting is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug products conducted by FDA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of May 12, 1993 (58 FR 28194), FDA published a notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC sunscreen drug products. In the
proposed rule, the agency discussed OTC sunscreen drug products that claim to provide protection from UVA radiation
and the public health significance of UVA radiation (58 FR 28194 at 28232 and 28233). The agency also discussed testing
procedures for sunscreens that absorb UVA radiation (58 FR 28194 at 28248 to 28250). The comment period for comments
related to UVA ingredients, claims, and testing closed on November 8, 1993. 



To ensure that sunscreen drug products having UVA protection claims offer significant UVA protection, the agency
proposed that an OTC sunscreen ingredient must have an absorption spectrum extending to 360 nanometers (nm) or above
in order to display UVA protection claims in its labeling (58 FR 28194 at 28233). The product would also have to demonstrate
meaningful UVA protection by satisfying UVA testing procedures that would be included in the monograph. However,
these procedures have yet to be established. The agency requested specific comments on appropriate procedures to
be used. Previously, the agency had requested specific information on UVA protection factors (Ref. 1).
