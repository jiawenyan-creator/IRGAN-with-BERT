FT  20 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Focus of S Africa reforms shifts to trade
 -The revised offer to be presented to Gatt
WHEN South Africa started on the road of political reform in 1990, this was
as much a function of the crippling economic cost of apartheid as it was a
reflection of the moral and political bankruptcy of that policy.
Since then, the country's faltering political fortunes have hogged the
limelight. Later this month, however, South Africa will present a revised
trade liberalisation offer to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt), which forms part of a revision of trade policy as fundamental as the
political reform under way.
Mr Stef Naude, director general of the Department of Trade and Industry,
comments: 'Without a doubt, this is the biggest reform of trade policy ever
undertaken in this country.'
The aim of the reform is simple: the transformation of the existing
industrial base, fed for decades on a diet of political isolation, import
substitution and strategic self-sufficiency, into an internationally
competitive, export-led manufacturing sector.
The Gatt offer is but the first of many initiatives which include reform of
export incentives, investigation of export processing zones, more efficient
anti-dumping legislation, a trade agreement with the EC and the future of
the South African Customs Union.
Pursued against the background of a weak economy, unemployment running at
over 40 per cent and fundamental political transition, it is a Herculean
labour.
No longer can government unilaterally decree policy changes. Democracy,
transparency and consultation are the new watchwords. When it comes to
economic policy, the imprimatur of the National Economic Forum, the
tripartite body where business, labour and government are represented, must
be sought.
At least in the area of trade policy, there is fairly broad consensus among
these three groups as to the way forward. Nobody would argue with the
premise, contained in the government's recently published Normative Economic
Model, that 'Much of the country's future economic prosperity will be
determined by its ability to play a bigger role in international trade in
industrial goods.'
This clearly requires conformity to Gatt, whose signatories all benefit from
'most favoured nation' status and 'national treatment' - the first ensuring
that any tariff cut offered by one country to a second must automatically be
extended to all other trading partners, and the second guaranteeing that an
exporter is treated just as a local company is treated.
'There is no way South Africa can fully reintegrate into the global economy
outside Gatt,' said Mr Stef Naude.
Conformity to Gatt is not the only reason for lowering tariff barriers. It
is also necessary to remove the anti-export bias in South Africa whereby
protection makes the local market more profitable than exports.
It also raises input costs for local exporters, making them uncompetitive
compared to exporters elsewhere who can obtain inputs at world prices.
A recent World Bank study of South Africa's trade policy found that it was
not overly protective, 'but far too fluid and complex, and biased against
exports.' Compared to developing countries, the protection level is fairly
average. According to NEM, South Africa's tariff barrier (weighted by import
values) stands at 21 per cent, though this rises to 27 per cent when account
is taken of special import surcharges  - which survive for fiscal rather
than protection purposes.
South Africa's revised Gatt offer will thus have two main features: first,
it will involve a one-third reduction in average tariff rates. Second, it
includes a dramatic rationalisation of the tariff structure which is
virtually unmatched in its complexity.
Instead of the current high degree of dispersion, tariff levels will range,
at 5 percentage point intervals, from zero to a maximum of 30 per cent (with
the exception of the motor industry).
Also, almost all tariffs will be bound - which means, in theory, they can
never be raised, only lowered. This compares with only 55 per cent in its
original offer.
South Africa has also committed itself to phasing out emergency dumping
formula duties, - a measure which has been the main instrument to counter
disruptive competition. to be replaced by proper anti-dumping measures,
further reducing the overall level of protection in the country as formula
duties often resulted in an increased overall level of protection.
The Gatt offer - particularly the lowering of import tariffs - should not be
seen in isolation. All parties agree that it will have to be accompanied by
supply-side support measures to assist local industry to improve its
competitiveness. With unemployment already at alarmingly high levels, the
social and political costs of simply dropping tariff barriers, without other
policies introduced in parallel, are unthinkable.
