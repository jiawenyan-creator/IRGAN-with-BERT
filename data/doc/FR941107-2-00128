<DOCTITLE>Magnetek; Owosso, MI, Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for NAFTA Transitional Adjustment
Assistance</DOCTITLE>


In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
Regarding Eligibility to apply for NAFTA-Transitional Adjustment Assistance on October 7, 1994 for workers of Magnetek
in Owosso, Michigan. The certification notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 21, 1994 (59 FR 53212).
At the request of the company, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The investigation
findings show that there are two Magnetek facilities in Owosso, Michigan and that the certification should only cover
the Main Street plant of Magnetek in Owosso, Michigan.
Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to properly reflect the correct worker group.
The amended notice applicable to NAFTA00222 is hereby issued as follows:



All workers of the Main Street plant of Magnetek in Owosso, Michigan who became totally or partially separated from
employment on or after December 8, 1993 are eligible to apply for NAFTATAA under Section 250 of the Trade Act
of 1974.



Signed at Washington, DC, this 27th day of October 1994.
