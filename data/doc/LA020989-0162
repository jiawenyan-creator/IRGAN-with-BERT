Missouri assistant basketball coach Bob Sundvold, who is accused of violating 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules by buying airline tickets for a 
then-Missouri player, has been suspended with pay. 
The suspension is pending the completion of an investigation by Athletic 
Director Dick Tamburo and faculty representative Carl Settergren into 
Sundvold's Dec. 27 report of the violation regarding his purchase of the 
airline tickets for P.J. Mays in October, 1988. 
In a Nov. 16 conversation taped by Mays' mother, Yvonne, Sundvold reportedly 
admitted that he paid for two airline tickets for her son and asked Mrs. Mays 
to tell a Missouri athletic department official that there had been a 
misunderstanding about who bought the tickets. 
"The University of Missouri has a proud history of integrity in athletics," 
Tamburo said in a statement. "And it's because of that tradition that I must 
react strongly to any improprieties in our program." 
Sundvold, 33, is in his 11th season on Coach Norm Stewart's staff.
