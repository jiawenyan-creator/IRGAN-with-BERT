 

II. Background



Schedule E addresses potential conflicts of interest that arise when a member participates in the public distribution
of its own securities or the securities of an affiliate. The standards for determining affiliation under Schedule
E are voting control through ownership of equity securities, or common control of management through interlocking
officerships or directorships. Where such conflicts exist, and absent an investment grade rating for debt securities
or a bona fide independent market for equity securities, Schedule E requires a qualified independent underwriter
to render an opinion on the offering price of the securities, conduct due diligence, and participate in the preparation
of the registration statement. The qualified independent underwriter also assumes underwriter's liability for
the offering. The NASD relies on the objectivity and independence of the qualified independent underwriter to resolve
the conflicts of interest present when a member distributes its own securities or those of an affiliate. 

After discussions with several member firms and a review of numerous leveraged buy-out offerings, the NASD determined
that a potential conflict of interest arises when a member engaged in an offering of the issuer's securities owns subordinated
debt, voting or non-voting equity of the issuer. The NASD is concerned about these offerings because members and their
affiliates often become holders of subordinated debt or non-voting equity as a result of their participation in leveraged
buy-out transactions, which could influence the independence of members' pricing and due diligence functions in
any subsequent related public offering. The proposed rule change addresses these potential conflicts by extending
Schedule E to situations in which a member participating in a public offering of debt or equity securities owns debt,
preferred equity, or non-voting common equity of the issuer.



III. The Proposal



The rule change prohibits members and their associated persons from participating in the distribution of a public
offering of securities if the member and/or its associated persons, parent, or affiliates have a conflict of interest
with the issuer. For purposes of the rule change, a ``conflict of interest'' would be presumed to exist if the member
and/or its associated persons, parent, or affiliates in the aggregate beneficially own 10% or more of the outstanding
subordinated debt,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 common equity,
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 or preferred equity
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 of the issuer. In addition, a ``conflict of interest'' would exist if the member and/or its associated persons, parent,
or affiliates beneficially owns a general, limited, or special partnership interest in 10% or more of the distributable
profits or losses of the issuer.



<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
The NASD has determined that subordinated debt issued in a leveraged buy-out or restructuring transaction raises
the greatest potential for a conflict of interest. In these situations, the subordinated debt takes on many equity
characteristics and the likelihood of repayment may be substantially based on the success of the new offering. The
NASD has not observed similar levels of conflict arising with respect to holders of short-term or senior debt. As a
result, the rule change does not apply either to senior debt, whether secured or unsecured, or to short-term debt with
a maturity at issuance of less than one year. The calculation of the 10% threshold is applicable to an issuer's entire
subordinated debt outstanding. The calculation of the ownership level will not be applied to the specific issue of
subordinated debt owned by the member but to the issuer's entire subordinated debt outstanding.

``Common equity'' includes the total number of shares of common stock outstanding without regard to class, voting
rights or other distinguishing characteristics as reflected on the consolidated financial statements of the company.

</FOOTNAME>
The term ``preferred equity'' would include the aggregate capital invested by all persons in the preferred securities
outstanding without regard to class, voting rights, or other distinguishing characteristics as reflected on the
consolidated financial statements of the company.

</FOOTNOTE>


The calculation of the 10% threshold would be based on all securities of the issuer beneficially owned by the member
at the time of the filing of the offering documents, including proprietary trading accounts and other fluctuating
positions, regardless of whether any of the securities are sold prior to effectiveness of the offering. With respect
to the ownership of subordinated debt, the calculation of the threshold would be based on the issuer's entire subordinated
debt outstanding_not just the issue owned by the member.

The rule change exempts (1) offerings by not-for-profit and charitable organizations; (2) investment companies
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940; (3) ``separate accounts'' as defined in the Investment Company
Act of 1940; (4) real estate investment trusts; (5) direct participation programs; (6) financing-instrument-backed
securities which are rated investment grade; (7) equity securities for which a bona fide independent market exists;
and (8) debt securities rated investment grade.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>




<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

</FOOTNAME>
Offerings in which the securities are being issued by a member or an affiliate of a member are subject to the filing requirements
of Schedule E regardless of whether the offering is of equity securities for which a bona fide independent market exists
or of debt securities which are rated investment grade.

</FOOTNOTE>


The rule change would also require disclosure of the conflict of interest in the offering document. The provision
currently requires that the offering document disclose (i) that the offering is being made pursuant to the provisions
of Schedule E; and (ii) the name of the qualified independent underwriter, and that such member is acting as a qualified
independent underwriter. In the case of an offering subject to the conflict of interest provisions, Schedule E would
require disclosure that the member or its associated persons, parent, or affiliates own the common stock, preferred
stock, or subordinated debt of the company.

Finally, the rule change provides an exception from the QIU pricing requirements of Schedule E in recapitalizations
or restructurings for a member who is acting solely as financial advisor but is otherwise subject to Schedule E because
of a conflict of interest or because the member is participating in offerings of securities of an affiliate. The NASD
believes that the more limited functions of the member acting as a financial advisor would not require the qualified
independent underwriter to provide a pricing opinion where the financial advisor does not participate in the pricing
opinion. The exception would not be available in the context of an offering by a member of its own securities or those
of its parent.



IV. Comments



The Commission receive one letter opposing the rule change from the Securities Industry Association (``SIA'').

 The NASD responded to these comments in Amendment No. 4. The SIA's comments and the NASD's responses are discussed
below.

Letter from David E. Rosedahl, Chairman, Federal Regulation Committee, SIA, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC
(December 30, 1993).

</FOOTNOTE>


The SIA argues that ownership of an issuer's debt or non-voting equity securities does not demonstrate a conflict
of interest requiring regulation under Schedule E. The SIA recognizes the NASD's concern that an underwriter could
obtain practical control of an issuer through holding a substantial amount of debt securities with ``equity-type
control powers.'' Nevertheless, the SIA argues, the concept of control in Schedule E is sufficiently broad to cover
the situation where an underwriter obtains practical control through holding a substantial amount of debt securities
with ``equity-type control powers.''
