FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Osborne back into property
Mr Trevor Osborne, former chairman of Speyhawk, the debt-strapped
development company which went into receivership in May, yesterday took
another step back into the property world with the launch of a facilities
management company.
The new concern, Building and Property Group, is a joint venture formed by
Amec, the UK construction company, and Pell Frischmann, the international
engineering consultancy.
BPG paid the UK government Pounds 10.4m for two former Property Services
Agency businesses, Building Management South East and Building Management
South &amp; West.
Mr Osborne, brought in to chair the company through Pell Frischmann, claimed
the joint venture is the UK's largest facilities management company, with
pre-tax profits forecast at Pounds 20m for the year to March 1994 on sales
of Pounds 450m.
Unkindly dubbed 'Clever Trevor', Mr Osborne, one of the best known figures
in the UK property industry, is anxious to put the unhappy experience of
Speyhawk behind him. At the time of the receivership 46 banks were owed more
than Pounds 350m secured on assets of Pounds 200m. Mr Osborne said:
'Building and Property is the story - not me.'
