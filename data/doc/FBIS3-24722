  [Text] Potchefstroom Jan 31 SAPA--African National Congress 
[ANC] leader Nelson Mandela said on Monday Afrikaners would not 
receive a separate election ballot, but his organisation would 
devise a means to gauge support for a volkstaat [Afrikaner 
homeland]. 
  On his campaign trail at the Boskop Agricultural Training 
Centre in Potchefstroom, Mr Mandela said his remarks on Sunday 
that Afrikaners could have a separate election ballot to vote 
for a volkstaat had not been accurate. "Afrikaners will not 
receive a separate ballot, but the ANC will devise a method 
through the election process where they will decide if the 
majority of Afrikaners want a volkstaat," he told the campaign 
rally. 
  On Sunday, Mr Mandela warned rightwingers not to do anything 
to plunge the country into a conflict. "We know how to fight 
too," he told a rally in Stilfontein.
