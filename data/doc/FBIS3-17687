  [Text] The opposition's planned rally in Baku on 26 March 
did not take place. It was to be led by Iskender Khamidov, the 
former interior minister, member of parliament, and leader of 
the Gray Wolves Party. 
  The police made detentions at the Freedom Square, among them 
ten reporters, including NEW YORK TIMES correspondent Thomas 
(Gols) who demanded to see a representative of the U.S. Embassy.
