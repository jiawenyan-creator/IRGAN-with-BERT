 

We believe that the spectrum of S/N ratios indicating suspect status in cattle and bison is too broad. We have determined
that tested cattle and bison with S/N values between 0.60 and 0.70, and thus classified under the regulations as brucellosis
suspects, almost always prove to be noninfected after supplemental testing. Moreover, we have also determined that
the vast majority of tested cattle and bison with S/N values between 0.25 and 0.30, and thus classified as brucellosis
suspects, prove to be brucellosis reactors in subsequent testing. 

We propose, therefore, to revise the PCFIA test standards to reflect this new information. This would allow the brucellosis
disease status of test-eligible cattle and bison to be more accurately determined. Under this proposal, cattle and
bison tested with the PCFIA test would be considered: 
(1) reactors when the S/N value of their test results is less than or equal to 0.30; (2) suspects when the S/N value is
greater than 0.30, and less than or equal to 0.60; and (3) negative when the S/N value is greater than 0.60. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 

We are proposing to amend the brucellosis regulations by revising standards established for the brucellosis testing
of cattle and bison with the PCFIA test. We believe that the test result standards in the current regulations which
indicate the disease status of tested animals can be improved. 
Incorrect brucellosis classification of cattle and bison as a result of 
the current PCFIA test standards creates marketing delays and unnecessary costs for farmers. Under the regulations,
cattle and bison classified as brucellosis suspects must either be quarantined and retested within 30 days or sold
for slaughter (usually at a loss). Consequently, farmers may unnecessarily quarantine or slaughter, at a loss, incorrectly
classified cattle and bison. Therefore, we believe our proposal to revise the PCFIA test result standards would save
farmers both time and money. 

Though we believe that the economic impact of this proposal would be positive, we also believe it would be minimal.
We anticipate that only about 7,200 cattle and bison in 560 herds (less than one thousandth of a percent of all cattle
and bison in the United States) are classified incorrectly as brucellosis suspects under our current regulations.
We estimate that all of the cattle and bison affected by this proposal would be owned by farms classified as small entities
under Small Business Administration standards. 

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
