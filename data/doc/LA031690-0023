BOB HOPE'S 7,400 ACRES 
In "Park Advocates Pressure Bob Hope for Land Gift" (Part A, March 7), it 
stated that when Bob Hope views his land he sees it as a potential golf course. 
But when I look at his land in Corral Canyon, I see a place of beauty and my 
only real home. 
I grew up in Corral Canyon, and as a boy I used to explore its cliffs and 
caves, untouched by mankind since the Chumash Indians first tread there. Now I 
live in the city, but my heart still remains in Corral Canyon. 
Now Hope plans to sell the canyon to Sun Pacific to build an exclusive country 
club. But how does one put a golf course, which must be fairly flat, into a 
canyon with towering thousand-foot cliffs? The plans are to move 5 million 
cubic yards of earth, equal to one and a half times the volume of the Great 
Pyramid. To Hope this may be one of the great wonders of the golfing world. But 
to those who love the canyon and places like it, the great wonder is why the 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors would approve such a massive 
desecration of the land. The supervisors apparently favor this project so 
highly that they gerrymandered Corral Canyon out of the boundaries of the 
proposed city of Malibu, knowing that the vast majority of Malibu residents 
oppose the project. 
The question remains, who should own a place of natural beauty such as Corral 
Canyon? The truth is that no one can really own it. What Hope owns is a permit 
to legally destroy it.
