FT  13 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US maize harvest at record
level up 27%
THE AGRICULTURE Department estimated yesterday that the 1992 US maize
harvest at a record high 9.48bn bushels, AP reports from Washington.
That amount would be more than 27 per cent above the 1991 crop and 2 per
cent above the Nov. 1 forecast.
The record-breaking yield of 131.4 bushels per acre exceeded the previous
record of 119.8 bushels per acre set in 1987. The 1992 yield was 22.8
bushels above the 1991 yield.
Farmers harvested 7.48bn bushels in 1991.
As livestock feed, maize is the largest and most important farm crop and is
essential for the production of meat, poultry and dairy products. Production
of soyabeans, a source of high-protein meal and vegetable oil, was estimated
at 2.2bn bushels in 1992, up 11 per cent compared with 1991 and one per cent
above the November forecast. Yield per acre averaged a record 37.6 bushels
per acre, up 13.5 bushels from 1991.
Sorghum for grain production was estimated at 884m bushels, up 51 per cent
from 1991.
Rice output totalled 179m cwt during 1992, 14 per cent above the 1991 total.
The Average yield was 5,722 lbs per acre, 48 per cent above the 1991
average.
Kevin Brown reports from Sydney: Australia reacted angrily yesterday to US
plans to sell 500,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat to Pakistan under the
Export Enhancement Program, which Washington claims is intended to combat
European Community export subsidies.
Mr Simon Crean, primary industries minister, said Australia intended to
register 'very strong concern and anger' with Washington, which also sold
800,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat to Pakistan in October. He said the US
decision had been made on the basis of incorrect information that Australia
would be unable to meet a Pakistani order for 600,000 tonnes of wheat
because of the effects of bad weather on the Australian crop.
