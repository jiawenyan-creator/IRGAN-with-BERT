FT  19 OCT 94 / People: SIB appoints Swiss Bank executive
The Securities and Investments Board has appointed Tim Shepheard-Welwyn,
most recently chief operating officer of Swiss Bank Corporation's Hong Kong
business, on a two-year secondment to a newly created post of adviser on
international affairs.
Shepheard-Welwyn, formerly a Bank of England boffin, was recruited to SBC in
1987 by Andrew Large, former head of SBCI in London and now chairman of the
SIB. The SIB says it approached several investment banks seeking a
candidate, and that only SBC was interested.
His duties will include co-ordinating the SIB's relationships with other
securities regulators.
He will also be considering the ticklish issue of devising a regulatory
structure for London which allows it to keep its pole position at a time of
increasing internationalisation of securities markets.
SBC has recently attracted hostility from London's investment banking
community for suggesting that it is time to change some of the clubby rules
on underwriting and trading securities, arguing that London risks its
international standing if it fails to do so.
But Shepheard-Welwyn says he has no intention of using his position to
advance SBC's interests.
