UCLA LANDS 4TH VALLEY RECRUIT IN HART'S ALLEN 
Brian Allen, a senior tight end at Hart High who led Valley-area players with 
62 receptions last season, has made a verbal commitment to attend UCLA in the 
fall. 
Allen, a first-team Times All-Valley selection, whittled his choices from 12 
schools to USC and UCLA before making his decision. 
"It was real close," Allen said. "The schools were so similar in every phase. I 
don't really know why I chose UCLA. I just liked it better." 
Former Hart teammates Jim Bonds, a quarterback who graduated in 1987, and 
tackle Brian Jacobs, who graduated in 1988, both attend UCLA. 
"I didn't let that influence me," Allen said. "I wanted to do what was best for 
me." 
Allen becomes the fourth Valley-area player this season to commit to UCLA. 
Agoura linebacker Carrick O'Quinn, Alemany defensive tackle Brian Swanson and 
Newbury Park quarterback Wayne Cook made earlier commitments to UCLA. 
Crespi running back Russell White has narrowed his list of schools to Cal, 
Washington and USC. He eliminated Notre Dame when it became apparent the 
defending national champion would not make a scholarship offer until White 
meets eligibility requirements by scoring 700 or better on the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test. White has cancelled a planned visit to Notre Dame. 
"I'm kind of disappointed, but that's the way it goes," said White, the state's 
all-time leading rusher and scorer. "But there's no guarantee I would have even 
liked it there. I might not have."
