FT  04 MAY 94 / People: TI Group
Mark Ellsmore has been appointed to the new full-time post of executive
director - Asia Pacific at TI Group, the specialist engineering concern.
The appointment comes two months after TI announced it had reached agreement
with the Sembawang Group, a leading Singapore-based industrial conglomerate,
to develop business opportunities in the Asia Pacific region.
TI said Ellsmore, aged 44, would pursue this initiative and ensure
appropriate group resources are allocated to other strategic opportunities
in the region.
The company believes the Asia Pacific offers strong growth opportunities for
all three of its core buinesses, John Crane, Bundy and Dowty.
Ellsmore joined TI Group in 1998 and became finance director of John Crane
International in 1992.
He will report to James Roe, director of strategic development, who said
Ellsmore's background in finance and marketing and his international
experience made him particularly well-suited to his new role.
