FT  22 MAY 93 / Building society inflow up to Pounds 1bn
BUILDING SOCIETIES had a net inflow of deposits from savers of Pounds 1.07bn
in April compared with Pounds 249m in March, enjoying their best month for
two years.
Net inflow was Pounds 820m for the whole of the previous three months. The
last time building societies had a comparable monthly inflow was April 1991,
when net recipts totalled Pounds 1.3bn.
Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said
the rise 'represents a significant departure from the modest inflows
experienced over recent months'.
He attributed the increase to 'the specific marketing efforts of individual
societies and seasonal factors rather than a general trend. As such the
inflow of savings may well fall back next month'.
Mr Nigel Richardson of Yamaichi Securities said the figures indicated that
people were saving more of their discretionary income, which had been rising
as a result of the fall in mortgage rates.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Greenwell Montagu, said: 'Building
societies will find it more difficult to whinge against National Savings as
a result of these figures. They discount fears of mortgage rate rises.'
National Savings contributed Pounds 249m to government funding in April, and
most of this - Pounds 162m - came from accrued interest.
Last year building societies claimed unfair competition by National Savings.
Its First Option Bond raised Pounds 800m in four months and Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester building society raised its mortgage rates as a result.
The increase in mortgage activity recorded in March was sustained in the
April building society figures. Gross mortgage lending was Pounds 2.71bn in
April, up fractionally from March. Net new commitments increased to Pounds
3.18bn, up from Pounds 3.09bn in March. Voluntary company liquidations in
England and Wales rose to 3,454 in the first quarter of the year compared
with 3,416 in the same period last year, KMPG Peat Marwick said.
