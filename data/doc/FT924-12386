FT  21 OCT 92 / Money supply shows first monthly decline
JAPAN'S broad money supply contracted by 0.4 per cent in September - the
first year-on-year decline on record - in a reflection of the severe
slowdown in the Japanese economy, the Bank of Japan said yesterday.
The decline was broadly in line with projections, but nonetheless increased
expectations that the Bank of Japan would move shortly to cut interest rates
again in an effort to stimulate the economy.
Monetary growth has been falling steadily since March, as bank lending has
stagnated.
The Bank of Japan put a brave face on the decline and said that monetary
growth would not interfere with any recovery in the economy.
Growth in broad liquidity, which includes deposits in Japan's postal savings
system, also plunged to a low of 2.8 per cent, compared to 3.2 per cent in
August. The central bank has in recent months placed increased emphasis on
broad liquidity as a more accurate gauge of economic activity.
'I think there will be an interest rate cut on these figures,' said Mr
Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities. He said that with inflation
running at around 2 per cent, the 2.8 per cent growth in broad liquidity was
insufficient to accommodate economic growth.
Mr Paul Summerville, economist at Jardine Fleming Securities, however, said
that the figures provided no surprises and that money supply had been
contracting in real terms for months.
