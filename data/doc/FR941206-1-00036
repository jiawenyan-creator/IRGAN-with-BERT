ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposes to approve a request for a State Implementation
Plan (SIP) revision, addressing the Chicago, Illinois ozone nonattainment area, submitted by the State of Illinois
for the purpose of offsetting any growth in emissions from growth in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) or number of vehicle
trips, and to attain reduction in motor vehicle emissions, in combination with other emission reduction requirements,
as necessary to comply with Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) milestone requirements of the Clean Air Act (Act).
The rationale for this proposed approval is set forth below; additional information is available at the address indicated
below.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: 
I. Background 


Section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Act, as amended in 1990 (Act), requires States containing ozone nonattainment areas
classified as ``severe'' pursuant to section 181(a) of the Act to adopt transportation control measures (TCMs) and
transportation control strategies to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT or number of vehicle trips,
and to attain reductions in motor vehicle emissions (in combination with other emission reduction requirements)
as necessary to comply with the Act's RFP milestones and attainment requirements. The requirements for establishing
a VMT Offset program are discussed in the April 16, 1992, General Preamble to Title I of the Act (57 FR 13498), in addition
to section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Act. 
For certain programs required under the Act (including VMT-Offset), USEPA had earlier adopted a policy pursuant
to section 110(k)(4) of the Act to conditionally approve SIPs that committed to provide the USEPA with specific enforceable
measures by a date certain. That interpretation was challenged in 

Natural Resources Defense Council

 v.

 Browner

, consolidated lawsuits brought in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In a full
opinion, dated May 6, 1994 (and in a March 8, 1994 Order and April 22, 1994 Amended Order issued earlier) the Court found
that USEPA's conditional approval interpretation exceeded USEPA's statutory authority. While the court did not
specifically address the VMT Offset program in it's orders or opinions, USEPA believes that the court's general conclusion
that the Agency's construction of the conditional approval provision was unlawful precludes USEPA from taking action
to approve any submitted VMT Offset committal SIPs. 
On November 26, 1993, the USEPA published a proposed rule (58 FR 62309) to conditionally approve Illinois's commitment
for the VMT-Offset requirement. 
In light of the decision reached in 

Natural Resources Defense Council

 v.

 Browner

, USEPA has decided not to go forward with conditional approvals of VMT committal SIPs, but that it would be appropriate
to interpret the VMT Offset provision of the Act to account for how States can practicably comply with each of the provision's
elements. The VMT Offset provision requires that States submit by November 15, 1992, specific enforceable TCMs and
strategies to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT or number of vehicle trips, sufficient to allow total
area emissions to comply with the RFP and attainment requirements of the Act.
