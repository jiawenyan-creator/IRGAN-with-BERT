  [Text] Taipei, March 22 (CNA) -- Taiwan's net capital 
outflow dropped to a six-year low of US$4.049 billion in 1993, 
according to statistics released by the Central Bank of China 
(CBC) Tuesday [22 March]. 
  In 1992, net capital outflow was US$8.556 billion, more than 
double the 1993 figure, a CBC official noted. 
  In 1987, net capital outflow was US$2.386 billion. In 1990, 
the figure hit a six-year high of US$10.552 billion, the 
statistics showed. 
  CBC attributed the sharp decrease in net capital outflow to 
the inward remittance of cash by foreign institutional investors 
and a decrease in outward investment by local investors.
