The International Weightlifting Federation, stung by a fresh wave of positive 
drug tests, is introducing a controversial testing system that critics say is 
unfair and unlawful. 
"We are ready to adopt the steroid profile procedure," Tamas Ajan, general 
secretary of the IWF, said. "It would be a good idea if other sports followed." 
Under the system, created by West Germany's Manfred Donike, the amount of 
steroids in an athlete's body can be detected not only at the time the test 
takes place, but several months beforehand, although the drug is not 
identified. 
The procedure has not yet gained formal approval from the International Olympic 
Committee. 
"If the IWF uses it, it'll be sued," said Arnold Beckett, a member of the IOC 
medical commission.
