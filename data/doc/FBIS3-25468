  [Excerpt] In Rwanda another politician has been 
assassinated. He is Felicien Gatabazi, secretary general of the 
Social Democratic Party, who was killed last night by bullet. 
  This assassination comes at a time when the installation of 
the bodies that will be in charge of governing the country 
during the transitional period begins today. The political 
class in Rwanda has been working on this installation for some 
time now in accordance with the peace accord signed in Arusha, 
Tanzania on 4 August 1993. However, the situation remains tense, 
especially in the capital, Kigali, where demonstrations of 
supporters and opponents of the prime minister of the transition 
period took place on 20 February, leaving several people dead. 
The authorities say they are determined to assume their 
responsibilities, and the various international organizations 
are also trying to find solutions to Rwanda's political 
problems. [passage omitted]
