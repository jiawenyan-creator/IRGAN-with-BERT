FT  15 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Transfer of ownership
I inherited my house from my husband in 1971 and have lived in it with my
son ever since. In 1985, ownership was converted into a beneficial joint
tenancy between us.
If I were now to make over ownership to him entirely, would any or all of
its value be included in my estate for the purposes of inheritance tax?
The transfer of the interest that gave rise to the joint tenancy with your
son is not a gift with reservation by you provided both of you are using the
property jointly and sharing the outgoings.
Transferring your interest to your son while you continue to live in the
property will not be effective for inheritance tax. Your interest will be
treated as still forming part of your estate. (Reply by Barry Stillerman).
