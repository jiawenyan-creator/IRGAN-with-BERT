FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: More job cuts at Pfizer,
Cyanamid
PFIZER and American Cyanamid, two of the biggest US drugs companies,
announced substantial staff cuts yesterday. The moves came as pricing
pressures and the threat of pending US healthcare reform continue to force
the industry to retrench.
Yesterday announcements follow last week's news from Eli Lilly that it would
cut about 4,000 jobs. Other big drugs companies, including Merck and Johnson
&amp; Johnson, have also announced job cuts.
Pfizer, considered one of the fastest-growing pharmaceuticals companies,
took an after-tax charge of Dollars 525m, or Dollars 1.63 a share, against
third-quarter earnings to cover its restructuring and streamlining moves.
These include the cutting of about 3,000 jobs. Ultimately, Pfizer expects to
reduce its staff by about 4,000, or 10 per cent.
Mr William Steere, Pfizer chairman and chief executive, said the company
needed to improve its operating efficiency in the face of fast-changing
market conditions.
'We believe that the prospect of US healthcare reform will further
accelerate changes already occurring in our industry,' he said.
The company is also writing off some assets and consolidating its
manufacturing, distribution and administrative operations. It expects the
restructuring to yield annual savings of at least Dollars 130m.
Including the restructuring charge, Pfizer posted a third-quarter net loss
of Dollars 214.2m, or 65 cents, compared with net income of Dollars 297.5m,
or 88 cents. Stripping out one-time charges, it had net income of Dollars
311m, or 98 cents, in the latest quarter. Sales rose 2 per cent to Dollars
1.87bn from Dollars 1.83bn.
For the nine months, net income was Dollars 368.6m, or Dollars 1.15, on
sales of Dollars 5.49bn, against earnings of Dollars 532.1m, or Dollars
1.58, on sales of Dollars 5.28bn. Excluding restructuring charges, Pfizer
earned Dollars 895m, or Dollars 2.78, in the 1993 period. Excluding charges
for accounting changes in the 1992 period, it earned Dollars 814.7m, or
Dollars 2.42.
American Cyanamid will take a pre-tax charge of between Dollars 150m and
Dollars 200m against fourth-quarter earnings to cover restructuring moves.
These include cutting about 2,500 jobs, or 9 per cent of its worldwide
workforce, in the next three years. Most of the cuts will come from medical
business.
