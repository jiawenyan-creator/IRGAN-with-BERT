  [Text] Athens, Jan. 25, IRNA -- Zionist authorities have 
imposed a news blackout on the conversion of a Jewish rabbi to 
Islam who fled to Morocco recently, Arab weekly paper 
'AL-MUSLIMUN' reported in its latest issue. The former rabbi is 
now preaching Islam in a mosque in Morocco after he abandoned 
his Jewish faith. The newspaper, published in Jeddah, did not 
mention the name of the rabbi nor when he fled to Morocco. 
  Jewish religious circles around the world are greatly 
concerned about the issue and some Zionist groups have called on 
the Zionist regime in occupied Palestine to demand the 
extradition of the former rabbi and to put him on trial for 
deserting his faith.
