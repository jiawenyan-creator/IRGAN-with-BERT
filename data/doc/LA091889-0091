BRIEFLY 
Argentina to Offer New Oil Licenses: Argentina is planning to offer licenses to 
search for and extract oil in 100 new areas as part of a policy to attract 
foreign investment, a government official said. The Noticias Argentinas news 
agency reported Secretary for Economic Coordination Orlando Ferreres as saying 
a program would encourage foreign companies to participate in the exploitation 
of other minerals. Since the government of President Carlos Menem took office 
in July, Argentina has awarded 25 contracts to private domestic and foreign oil 
companies to search for oil in marginal lands.
