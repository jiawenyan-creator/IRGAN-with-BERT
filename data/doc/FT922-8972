FT  09 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson springs surprise
THE London market was shaken late yesterday by the news that Hanson had
placed its 20m shares in ICI.
US broker Goldman Sachs said after the market closed last night: 'We can
confirm that we purchased the shares. It is a deal worth approximately
Dollars 500m (Pounds 280m).' Analysts said last night that the figure
represented 1400p a share for Hanson.
Goldman's bald statement marks the end of a year of intense speculation that
began when UK securities house Smith New Court raided the market to pick up
the stock - which represents 2.82 per cent of ICI's equity - at 1194 1/2 p.
The first clue that something was afoot yesterday came in the London Traded
Options market where, unusually, Hanson was the most heavily traded stock
option.
The market was surprised that the shares were sold at a premium and this
fuelled a strong belief that at least 10m shares went to US investors - who
still believe the UK offers bargains - at 1410p a share.
Mr Charles Lambert, chemicals analyst with Smith New Court, said yesterday:
'The timing was very good and it was a gutsy deal. I think there was a
general air of expectancy that something would happen but everyone believed
the deal would be done at a discount to the market.'
Hanson closed 2 3/4 better at 238 1/2 p with 18m shares traded while ICI
ended the day 17 up at 1403p with a recorded turnover of 20m.
P&amp;O in demand
P&amp;O turned out to be one of the star performers of the session as the shares
raced forward on a combination of a broker's recommendation, a shortage of
stock and an upbeat AGM statement. The day's advance started after agency
broker James Capel reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock, with
analyst Ms Yasmin Harrison saying: 'It's a cheap recovery stock with most of
the uncertainity now out of the way.'
Demand was further boosted by a positive statement at the company's annual
meeting. A squeeze developed around lunchtime, with one marketmaker reported
to have been caught short, which led briefly to a 'backwardation', a point
at which the highest bid is above the best offer in the market. The shares
eventually closed up 22 at 540p, on turnover of 3.5m shares.
Vodafone retreated after a bright start on news that Cellnet was planning to
introduce its GSM digital cellular network next year, 12 months ahead of
schedule. The Cellnet announcement was apparently made at a staff
conference, where it was also stated that price cuts would be introduced at
the same time. Vodafone shares, which touched 372p, closed at 369p, up 5 on
the day, in busy volume of 6.4m.
Overseas buyers were keen on British Telecom partly paid, the shares
advancing 5 to 132 1/2 p in hectic turnover of 26m. BT fully-paid rose 6 to
353 1/2 p with 8.9m dealt.
Investors continued to bail out of BP following disappointing first-quarter
figures on Thursday, the shares falling 8 to 251 1/2 p - the biggest
percentage fall of any of the stocks in the FT-SE Index - with 24m traded.
The stock was said to have received some support from securities house Hoare
Govett but most analysts were increasingly bearish with Nomura the latest to
cut its profit forecast. Dealers also said that Standard &amp; Poors, the US
credit rating agency, had put the company on 'downgrade alert'.
British Gas fell 4 1/2 to 256 1/2 p against the trend amid fears about the
impact of possible future price cuts.
Reed International gained 18 to 593p, helped by a research note by
investment bank S. G. Warburg and a stock shortage. Central Television
jumped 35 to 1433p helped by a more positive recommendation from Kleinwort
Benson's media team, which put the company on its buy list and raised its
1992 profit forecast to Pounds 38.5m.
Cadbury-Schweppes were active, on turnover of 4.2m shares, climbing 17 to
487p, as bid speculation increased after Hanson disposed of its investment
in ICI.
Hillsdown slipped 5 to 180p, as a hefty 7.3m shares were traded.
Unilever rose 14 to 944p ahead of next Friday's first quarter results.
Asda was again very active, as 38m shares changed hands, with the price
rising  3/4 to 28 3/4 p. J. Sainsbury improved 4 1/2 to 437p ahead of next
week's results, while Shoprite continued to weaken on profit-taking, sliding
20 to 467p. Sears, which reported disappointing profits this week, rose 2 at
99p, recovering part of Thursday fall, on turnover of 21m shares.
A squeeze in BAA as the company agreed an office development deal with
British Airways sent the shares climbing 16 to 645p. But continued talk of a
rights issue at BA weakened the shares and they eased a penny to 283p.
Tiphook jumped 17 to 446p, following a buy recommendation from County
NatWest.
Economic optimism boosted the engineering and motor sectors. The day's
outstanding performances included IMI, up 6 to 287p, after a favourable
annual meeting, Smiths Industries, 11 better at 335p, as the company
continued making presentations to investors, and BBA Group, 11 harder at
157p. Vickers also jumped 11, to 173p, after Albert E Sharp, the
Midland-based broker, was reported to have increased its current year
forecast by Pounds 9m to Pounds 30m after a visit to the company.
The brewing and drinks sector was very firm. Grand Metropolitan gained 10 to
510p, with Allied-Lyons up 9 at 638p and Guinness 4 higher at 632p,
following a recommendation from Daiwa. Mr Dermot Carr, drinks analyst at the
Japanese securities house, said EC draft proposals for harmonisation of
spirits excise duty across Europe should boost the shares in these
companies, although he pointed out there is some disagreement over the
minimum duty rate.
Several leading brewers, including Allied, Grand Met and Bass, rising 8 to
645p, report their results in the next two weeks and are expected to make
encouraging statements about economic recovery. Hoare Govett also issued a
buy recommendation for Allied and Guinness, plus Bass.
French stockbroker Strauss Generale, Strauss Turnbull's insurance analyst,
spoke at the morning meeting in favour of Commercial Union (up 4 at 500p)
and against Royal Insurance (down 3 at 229p)
