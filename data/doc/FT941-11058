FT  07 FEB 94 / Airlines join forces
Loss-making Italian state carrier Alitalia and the US airline Continental
have agreed to join forces in serving certain key routes between the US and
Italy, Reuter reports from Rome.
La Repubblica newspaper said the two airlines had signed a letter of intent
on co-operation on flights linking Rome and Milan with Newark and Houston.
La Repubblica, quoting US sources, said the deal was originally due to be
signed in the first half of February but it had been delayed until March 10
because of management changes at Alitalia.
Alitalia's parent, state industrial holding Iri, last week appointed two
former computer industry executives to head the debt-laden airline in a move
to stem huge losses.
Burdened by Dollars 1.17bn of debts, Alitalia is forecast to post 1993
losses of around Dollars 270m.
