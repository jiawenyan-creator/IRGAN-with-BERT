BACK-TO-BACK SEQUELS FOR 'BACK TO FUTURE' 
Michael J. Fox and director Robert Zemeckis will reunite later this month to 
begin filming two sequels of their 1985 hit "Back to the Future." 
Universal Pictures' unusual plan to produce the two films back to back is 
intended to keep production costs down and to take advantage of an extended 
break in Fox's schedule. Fox is currently wrapping up the seventh and final 
season of NBC's "Family Ties," and he will work simultaneously on the TV show 
and the first sequel when the film goes into production Feb. 20. 
Universal plans to release the new films in the winter of 1989 and the summer 
of 1990, respectively. Though Zemeckis, who was honored this week with a 
Director's Guild of America Award nomination for "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," 
would not reveal any plot details, both films are expected to involve time 
travel and some elaborate production effects. 
In a telephone interview Friday, Zemeckis said the "two movies would have 
average scale budgets for big movies," but he declined to give any exact dollar 
figures. 
"You never know how the audience will respond to these characters again," 
Zemeckis said, when asked whether the premise and characters of the first film 
would remain fresh and attractive through two additional installments. "We feel 
close to these characters, and we didn't want other people to do the sequel. We 
didn't want to see our material tampered with." 
The sequels are reuniting virtually all of the key production people and cast 
members from the original film. They will be produced under the banner of 
Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment and Spielberg will again serve as 
executive producer; Zemeckis and his long-time writing collaborator Bob Gale 
are teaming up again on the scripts; and Gale and Neil Canton, co-producers of 
"Back to the Future," will co-produce Parts 2 and 3. STEVE WEINSTEIN
