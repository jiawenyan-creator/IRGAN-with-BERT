  [Text] Following the European Parliament's approval of a 
motion warning against the appointment of fascist ministers in 
the Italian Government, Strasbourg is now backtracking. Egon 
Klepsch, president of the European Parliament, came out against 
yesterday's vote and has not ruled out the possibility of the 
resolution being cancelled because of the differences in the 
text translated into the various parliamentary languages. 
  The European Parliament president stressed that the 
Parliament did not want to give the impression that Italy is not 
a secure member of the democratic front. He concluded that 
Italy's commitment to democracy was beyond doubt. 
  The motion warning against the inclusion of fascists in the 
government was presented by Jean-Pierre Cot, the French 
president of the Socialist parliamentary group. 
  President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro yesterday sent a letter of 
protest to the Parliament condemning the vote. Irene Pivetti 
and Carlo Scognamiglio, the speakers of the Chamber of Deputies 
and the Senate, sent letters today.
