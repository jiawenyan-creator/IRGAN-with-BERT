BETTING WITH BOB 
Times handicapper Bob Mieszerski, who had his biggest winning day -- $359.10 on 
Sunday -- will try to keep his streak going today when he wagers a $25 win 
parlay from Maid O Gold in the third to Kimo's Kid in the seventh. Bob, who 
started the meeting with a mythical $1,000 bankroll, is now back to $925.80.
