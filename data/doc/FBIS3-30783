  [Text] Belgrade, Feb 9 (TANJUG) -- Two weeks after the 
introduction of the new Yugoslav economic programme retail 
prices in Belgrade stores have been reduced by a third on the 
average but have not resulted in a marked increase in the 
turnover because the population is on the verge of subsistence 
after a 20-month long international blockade. 
  Most people only buy bread, milk and the basic necessities. 
according to prices on Wednesday 747 dinars are needed for the 
subsistence of a family of four, the Belgrade statistics bureau 
assessed. The guranteed minimum wage in Yugoslavia (Serbia and 
Montenegro) is 20 new dinars (20 German Marks), and the average 
wage is 40 dinars. 
  There are virtually no customers for textile goods, 
clothing, 
shoes, furniture and household appliances even though stores 
offer the possibility of payment in two monthly installments and 
have cut the prices by 50-per cent. In the first four days of 
the implementation of the programme the retail price growth has 
dropped from 313 million per cent a month to 888 per cent. 
  The most serious problem for the experts who have drawn up 
the programme will be how to revive production which has come to 
a virtual standstill due to the stringent economic sanctions 
imposed on the country, which include an oil embargo. 
  Imports are banned and there is practically no market 
competition so that prices in Belgrade are the same, and often 
even higher, than in the largest cities of the world. At the 
same time wages are lower than in most African countries even 
though Yugoslavia had been at the level of a medium-developed 
European state before sanctions were introduced.
