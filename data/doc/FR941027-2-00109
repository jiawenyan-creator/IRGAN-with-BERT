I. Description



Since 1993, NSCC has been redesigning its bond comparison system to accelerate the processing (

i.e., 

submission and comparison) of bond transactions to achieve higher rates of trade comparison at earlier points in
the comparison process.3 NSCC believes accelerated processing will help to increase certainty and reduce risk in
the clearance and settlement of debt transactions. The first phase of the redesign process enhanced the processing
of transactions in municipal securities and was implemented by NSCC on August 13, 1993.4









The primary purpose of the current proposed rule change is to expand the accelerated comparison system to include
the processing of transactions in corporate bonds and unit investment trusts (``UITs''). The proposed rule change
also permits NSCC to provide comparison services for baby bonds (

i.e.

, corporate bonds having a par value of less than $1,000) and new issue trading. The proposed rule change also modifies
the fee structure for correction fees. 

Under the proposed rule change, the cutoff time for submission of original trade input for all corporate bond and UIT
transactions is moved from 1:00 p.m. on the day following trade date (``T+1'') to 2:00 a.m. on T+1. These trades will
be reported back to members by 8:00 a.m. on T+1. Adjustments to original trade input will have to be made prior to the
time specified by NSCC on T+1, which will be 6:00 p.m. 

In addition, NSCC will accept trade input for trade-for-trade processing of corporate baby bonds. If transactions
are submitted as a mixed lot (

i.e., 

submissions including baby bonds and round lots), the baby bond and the round lot portions of the transaction will
be separated by NSCC upon input. 

At the option of members, corporate bond and UIT transactions will be compared when the net buy side and sell side aggregate
principal amounts can be matched for a particular security, even if the relevant principal amounts are specified
in more than one buy side and/or more than one sell side submission, if the transactions would have been compared had
such buy side and sell side principal amounts each been specified on a single submission. 

Because correction processing occurs at the New York and American Stock Exchanges and at the National Association
of Securities Dealers before the trade input is transmitted to NSCC, Add-by-Seller, Delete-by-Seller, Delete Add-by-Seller,
and Delete-by-Buyer instructions will no longer be accepted under the proposed rule.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 This change is being made in order to standardize correction processing.

Dealers correction processing systems, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 26773 (May 1, 1989), 54 FR 20227
[File No. SRNYSE8903] (order approving the New York Stock Exchange's system for the resolution
of uncompared transactions); 28069 (May 29, 1990), 55 FR 23324 [File No. SRAMEX9001] (order
approving the Intra-Day Comparison System for resolving uncompared transactions); and 28583 (November 1, 1990),
55 FR 46120 [File No. SRNASD8925] (order granting accelerated approval of amendment to proposed
rule change relating to the Automated Confirmation Transaction Service).

</FOOTNOTE>


NSCC will provide comparison services for corporate bond new issue transactions on the same basic terms and conditions
as it currently provided for municipal securities transactions with the exception of syndicate takedown processing.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Original trade input for new issue corporate bond transactions will be accepted until the third day prior to the initial
settlement date for the issue. Original input may set forth either (1) a final settlement price and a settlement date
that is either the initial settlement date or a specified number of days after the initial settlement date or (2) a dollar
price. Original trade input that is submitted between three and five days prior to the initial settlement date but
does not set forth a final settlement price and settlement date or does not set forth a dollar price will be treated as
regular way input. Any corporate bond new issue transactions that remain uncompared at the opening of business on
the day prior to the initial settlement date will be deleted from NSCC's system.

</FOOTNAME>
NSCC defines ``new issue'' transactions in this context to mean transactions which are to settle on the initial settlement
date for an issue or which are to settle a specified number of days after the initial settlement date.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
This means that it may not be possible to process some new issue transactions through the entire range of available
trade resolution procedures prior to being dropped. In the extreme case, new issue submissions made on the second
day prior to the initial settlement date that do not compare will be dropped without any opportunity for resolution.
These unresolved trades will be reported on a separate unresolved trade report, and any trade dropped without the
opportunity for resolution may be resubmitted after the initial settlement date.
