  [Text] Convicted reporter Xi Yang has a fair chance of 
winning his appeal and a cut in his 12-year jail term or even a 
suspended sentence, according to legal experts in Chinese law. 
University lecturer at the City Polytechnic's Faculty of Law, 
Priscilla Leung Mei-fun, said the 12-year sentence Xi received 
was not justified. "Twelve years of imprisonment was only 
qualified for a state secret of absolute confidentiality but we 
cannot see very serious consequences coming from the offence he 
was accused of committing," she said. 
  Therefore, Xi might be able to appeal for a reduction in the 
jail term to under three years and a suspension of the penalty. 
"It is possible. We have dealt with cases before that a Hong 
Kong defendant in China who had been sentenced to life 
imprisonment but had appealed for an immediate release 
successfully," she said. "The fact that Xi was allowed to 
choose a lawyer to represent him in the appeal can be considered 
as a gesture of a way out for him," she said. 
  But she criticised China's definition of "state secret" as 
too loose, and journalists who were not familiar with the legal 
system in China might be trapped. "There are a lot of loopholes 
in Chinese law. `State secrets,' for instance, needs a lot of 
explanation by the court," she said. 
  She also warned the Hong Kong media to be careful when 
covering Xi's case and avoid issues which might be considered 
"sensitive" by Beijing. 
  Another academic, Chang Hsin, of the Chinese University, 
said 
he was shocked when told about Xi's sentence. Mr Chang, who 
taught for many years in the Law Department of Beijing 
University, said Beijing may yield to international pressure and 
cut short Xi's sentence. "I think the authorities might change 
their minds and grant him a successful appeal," he said.
