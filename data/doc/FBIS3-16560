  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- Armed men in military 
uniforms seized the mayor's office of the Russian far east port 
city of Vladivostok early Thursday [17 March], detaining Mayor 
Viktor Cherepkov, the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY reported. 
  ITAR-TASS quoted the city's deputy mayor as saying he has 
appealed for help to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  In a report monitored in Tokyo, ITAR-TASS also quoted the 
deputy mayor as saying, "there are no legitimate authorities in 
the city now." 
  The mayor's office identified the armed men in uniform as 
"elite OMON [Special Purpose Militia Detachment] policemen," who 
reportedly were acting on instructions from the deputy governor 
of the maritime region. 
  The dispatch, without mentioning the identity of its source, 
carried a commentary saying the events resulted from a 
"protracted conflict between the mayor and the regional 
authorities." 
  The news agency again quoted the mayor's office, without 
naming the actual person who made the allegation, as saying that 
Cherepkov had a heart attack on Wednesday, prompting his doctors 
to urge him to stay in bed. 
  It said the alleged OMON police could not interrogate the 
mayor, while the mayor's lawyer was not allowed to meet his 
client.
