FT  06 OCT 94 / French MPs may face audits
France's ministers, MPs and leading local politicians should be submitted to
an annual audit of their personal financial assets, designed to screen them
for possible corruption, the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, said
yesterday. Bowing to increasing public and political pressure for action to
stem the rising tide of corruption allegations, Mr Balladur proposed that
the National Assembly set up a system by the end of this year whereby a
panel of senior magistrates would examine politicians' assets and refer any
'presumed irregularities' to prosecutors. Pressure on the Gaullist RPR prime
minister increased with this week's opening of a judicial investigation into
allegations that the Republican party, a coalition partner in the
government, has illegally received corporate funds in the past. A Communist
MP yesterday accused Mr Balladur of 'covering with his protecting wing three
members of the government', a reference to its trio of Republican ministers.
Of this trio, Mr Gerard Longuet, the trade and industry minister, is the
most likely to resign following the sort of allegations about personal
financial and real estate assets that Mr Balladur's audit plan is aimed at
meeting.
