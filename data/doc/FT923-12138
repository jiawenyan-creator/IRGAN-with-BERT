FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Siemens makes 8% advance
SIEMENS, the German elec-trical and electronics concern, yesterday reported
an 8 per cent rise in net profits to DM1.3bn (Dollars 890m) for the nine
months to end-June. The company said it had been cutting jobs in some
sectors as a result of weak orders and restructuring needs.
Its workforce actually rose by 13,000 to 415,000 in the September-June
period, but this was due to the effect of acquisitions. Excluding these, the
labour force had dropped by 7,000 people, the company said.
The group's worst performing sectors are semiconductors, electronic
components, private telecommunications systems and computers. Its Siemens
Nixdorf subsidiary was formed by joining its own computer interests with
those of loss-making Nixdorf Computer.
The nine-month results are in line with Siemens' expectations for the full
year. At the interim press conference in Dresden earlier this month, Mr
Karl-Hermann Baumann, finance director, said earnings for the full financial
year to September 30 would total around DM1.9bn, an 8 per cent improvement.
Turnover was also expected to rise by 8 per cent to around DM80bn.
In the first nine months, turnover rose at an 8 per cent rate to reach
DM55bn, with domestic business 14 per cent higher and foreign turnover up by
only 3 per cent.
The order inflow was 3 per cent higher at DM63bn; domestic orders were up by
11 per cent and those from abroad down by 4 per cent.
Siemens has realised significant benefits from the rebuilding of the east
German economy, with a big jump in orders for its transport,
telecommunications and automation activities. Power generation, car
electronics and medical technology operations have also been performing
well.
For the full year, the order inflow is expected to total around DM86bn, a
rise of 4 per cent.
Lufthansa, the German state-controlled airline, does not expect a
significant improvement in profits this year after posting a group net loss
of DM426m in 1991, Reuter reports.
Juergen Weber, chairman, said the company would cut 1,700 jobs this year
from the 50,826 employed at the end of 1991. He said Lufthansa would also
like to cut 3,000 further jobs in 1993.
