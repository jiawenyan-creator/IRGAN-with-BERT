  [Text] Sinn Fein said today a "definitive" response to the 
Downing Street declaration on Ulster is unlikely to emerge from 
the party's annual conference in Dublin this weekend. 
  An emergency motion tabled by the executive of the IRA's 
political wing for the two-day meeting merely repeats demands 
for clarification from Britain "which has the power and 
responsibility to advance the situation." 
  Senior Sinn Fein official Pat McGeown said the party had 
been 
left in "an impossible position" by the British refusal to 
clarify the declaration signed in December by Prime Minister 
John Major and Irish Premier Albert Reynolds. 
  He insisted: "There are issues still needing to be 
clarified. 
As soon as we get that clarification we will respond." 
  Mr. McGeown said he believed the IRA were in a similar 
position, adding: "In the present circumstances, it is unlikely 
there will be a definitive decision this weekend." 
  Sinn Fein were seeking explanations from Britain in 
connection with its long-term policy on Northern Ireland, he 
told a Dublin news conference. 
  "The big question is whether the British are serious about 
the peace process." 
  He added that consultations would continue within Sinn Fein, 
but it was still not possible to say when the reponse would come.
