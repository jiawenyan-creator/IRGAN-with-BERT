FT  27 APR 91 / Letter: Football index
Sir, Following Observer's comments (April 23) about the rise in football
programme cover prices after Sunday's Rumbelows League Cup Final, would it
be possible to re-base the programme index to allow for the increased size
and number of pages, paper quality and colour improvements etc.?
I wager the price per square inch alone would justify a large part of the
increase. Colour improvements are a bonus.
