FT  14 OCT 92 / Old and new
This 1911 Delahaye fire engine will feature in an auction of historic and
classic vehicles on October 24. It is expected to sell for between Pounds
8,000 and Pounds 10,000.
The Delahaye engine, pictured outside Soho Fire Station in London, is
contrasted with a state-of-the-art Volvo Saxon fire engine. The Saxon costs
Pounds 100,000 off the shelf and un-equipped. The sale - organised by
auction house Sotheby's - will take place at the RAF Museum, at Hendon,
north London.
