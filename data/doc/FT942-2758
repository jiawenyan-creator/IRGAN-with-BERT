FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Bloomsbury valued at Pounds 9m in placing
Shares in Bloomsbury Publishing, one of the UK's leading independent book
publishers, have been placed at 105p, giving the eight-year-old company a
market capitalisation of Pounds 9m.
A total of 5.26m shares were placed with institutions by Beeson Gregory at
14 times historic earnings. Dealings in the shares, which will have a full
listing, commence on June 23.
The net proceeds of the placing to the company of Pounds 2.7m will be used
to fund the expansion of the new paperback, children's and home reference
books divisions and to acquire the rights to works of leading authors.
The company also intends to repay Pounds 1.15m of loan stock and about
Pounds 250,000 of accrued dividends and loan stock interest.
Bloomsbury made an operating profit of Pounds 856,000 in the year to
December on turnover of Pounds 8.5m, up 41 per cent and 5.6 per cent
respectively on 1992.
On a notional net dividend of 2.94p last year, the gross dividend yield at
the flotation price was 3.5 per cent.
Following the placing, Mr Nigel Newton, founding chairman and managing
director, will own 9.7 per cent of the ordinary share capital, approximately
90 per cent of his original stake in the company. However, two other
founding directors, Ms Liz Calder and Mr Alan Wherry, are selling virtually
all of their shareholdings.
Bloomsbury's original backers, Caledonia Investments and Legal &amp; General,
will own 14.7 per cent and 5.1 per cent respectively, while Baring
Investment Management will hold 8.2 per cent.
