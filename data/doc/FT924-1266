FT  18 DEC 92 / Backing for Polish miners
Poland's steelworkers yesterday threw their backing behind the the stoppages
sweeping the industrial heartland of Silesia, as strikes spread to all but
five of the country's 70 coal mines, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
The steelworkers declared a 'strike alert' to underscore their support,
enabling them to take action if the government refused to meet the miners'
demands. Protests began on Monday against government wage curbs on state
industries.
