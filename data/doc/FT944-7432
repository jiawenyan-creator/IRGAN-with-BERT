FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Strong advance at ICI India
ICI India, a subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK, yesterday
announced a 77 per cent increase in gross profits for the first six months
to September and a 15 per cent advance in turnover for the period.
The company's profit before tax increased to Rs254.3m (Dollars 8.1m) from
Rs47.4m last year. Net sales increased to Rs2.82bn from Rs2.36bn reflecting
improved trading conditions and the intrinsic strengths of the diversified
product portfolio of the company.
Gross profit after the deduction of interest but before depreciation and
taxation increased to Rs341.6m from Rs192.5m last year.
The company said the explosives business continued to suffer from low prices
in an oversupplied market. With this exception, the company's other
businesses contributed to the large upturn. The restructuring of the
company's portfolio resulted in a steep reduction in interest costs and the
effective elimination of debt.
ICI India said it had restructured the seeds business during the half-year,
resulting in a profit of Rs13.2m. Profit after tax rose 59 per cent to
Rs150.5m, in spite of the fact that the previous period included a large
gain from the disposal of the company's fibres business.
