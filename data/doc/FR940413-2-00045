SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 29, 1991 (56 FR 24190), which announced that Stine Microbial Products, 4722 Pflaum Road, Madison, WI 53704,
had submitted applications to register the pesticide products Blue Circle and SMP PcpWi (EPA File Symbols 63950R
and 63950E), ~containing the active ingredient

 Pseudomonas cepacia

 type Wisconsin at 3.8 percent for both, an active ingredient not included in any previously registered products.

~~

The applications were approved on December 28, 1992, as Blue Circle as a seed treatment on various crops prior to planting
(EPA Reg. No. 639501) and SMP PcpWi for manufacturing use only (EPA Reg. No. 639502). 
~~The Agency has considered all required data on risks associated with the proposed use of

 Pseudomonas cepacia

 type Wisconsin, and information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from use. Specifically,
the Agency has considered the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level
and extent of potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health safety determinations
which show that use of

 Pseudomonas cepacia

 type Wisconsin when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, will not generally cause
unreasonable adverse effects to the environment. 
More detailed information on these registrations is contained in a Chemical Fact Sheet on

 Pseudomonas cepacia

 type Wisconsin. 
A copy of this fact sheet, which provides a summary description of the chemical, use patterns and formulations, science
findings, and the Agency's regulatory position and rationale, may be obtained from the National Technical Information
Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. 
In accordance with section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA, a copy of the approved label and the list of data references used to support
registration are available for public inspection in the office of the Product Manager. The data and other scientific
information used to support registration, except for material specifically protected by section 10 of FIFRA, are
available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division
(7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. 1132, CM #2, Arlington, VA 22202 (7033055805).
Requests for data must be made in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and must be addressed
