FT  06 DEC 94 / Technology: Pursuit of 'best' debtors
Legal &amp; Trade, the consumer debt recovery company, has introduced a
computer-based credit scoring system designed to cut legal and
administrative costs by enabling companies to pursue cases most likely to
yield repayment.
Its Epic 2 system provides users with a detailed score for individual
debtors and an assessment of the likely success of litigation.
Epic 2 uses account information on debtors, such as their repayment records,
supplied by users, such as banks, building societies and public utilities.
It combines this with information on county court judgments and consumer
credit data supplied by Equifax Europe, the credit ratings agency.
Legal &amp; Trade says there are currently 3m debtors on the database, of which
250,000 have been assessed as worth pursuing for debt repayment.
Typical results from the banking and utility sector, according to Legal &amp;
Trade, suggest that if a business normally achieves a 30 per cent success
rate by suing 1,000 debtors a week, Epic will increase this to 60 per cent.
This means a business can sue about 500 debtors and still win about 280 of
the cases. The amount of money recovered may not change, but savings are
made by cutting the cost of pursuing hopeless or marginal cases.
Epic 2 replaces a forecasting system introduced in 1990. Legal &amp; Trade says
credit scoring technology has improved since then, and that it has widened
and updated database material.
The Epic 2 service is provided by Equifax from its mainframe computer.
Access is via a PC, on tape or disk, on-line with a modem, or manually.
Before computerisation, credit assessors made manual checks by sending
representatives to individual homes. This was more costly and it meant the
assessment depended in part on a representative's subjective view, according
to Legal &amp; Trade.
