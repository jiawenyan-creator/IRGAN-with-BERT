FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Hewlett earnings disappoint
SHARES in Hewlett-Packard took a beating for the second time this month
after the computer and electronic equipment manufacturer turned in
third-quarter earnings that were at the bottom of its projections.
Shares in the company tumbled Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 57 1/4 in active
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock lost more than Dollars 12
earlier in the month when Hewlett warned its third-quarter results would be
between 76 cent to 87 cents a share, well below Wall Street's expectations
of Dollars 1.12 a share.
In the end, net income for the three months to July 31 was Dollars 191m, or
76 cents a share, compared with Dollars 192m, or 76 cents a year earlier.
Revenues rose to Dollars 4bn from Dollars 3.5bn in the quarter.
The company blamed the higher costs of sales for its disappointing earnings.
Although sales remained strong in the quarter, gross margins were squeezed.
by lower prices and a shift towards products with lower gross margins.
Mr John Young, chief executive, said: 'The short term looks very
challenging.
Worldwide economic conditions are a concern, with weak levels of capital
spending still affecting many parts of our business.'
Nevertheless, Mr Young said the company was in an excellent competitive
position. He added that they were making structural adjustments to parts of
the business and there were new products on the way that should strengthen
their portfolio.
For the first nine months, net earnings rose 31 per cent to Dollars 823m, or
Dollars 3.25, from Dollars 630m, or Dollars 2.52 a year ago.
Revenues increased 13 per cent to Dollars 12.1bn.
