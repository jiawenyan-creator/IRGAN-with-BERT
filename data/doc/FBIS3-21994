  [Excerpts] La Paz, 27 Feb -- While being evicted from the 
Direco [Coca Reduction Directorate] offices in Ivirgarzama -- in 
the subtropical region of Cochabamba Department early on the 
morning of 26 February -- three peasants were injured and 60 
were arrested and later released. 
  Minister of Government German Quiroga supplied this 
information and denied that anyone had been killed, as certain 
news media had reported. He said firearms were not used to 
evict over 1,500 peasants who invaded the Direco offices 
protesting the alleged compulsory eradication of their coca 
plantations. [passage omitted] 
  The minister reported that approximately 70 coca maceration 
pits have been discovered in the outskirts of Ivirgarzama in 
recent weeks. It is estimated that these maceration pits 
produced 3.5 metric tons of cocaine base per month. The 
discovery of these pits was the main cause for the eradication 
of some plantations in compliance with current laws. There was 
no compulsory eradication of plantations as claimed by the 
peasants who invaded the Direco offices in Ivirgarzama 
  Minister Quiroga said: "Relative calm has been restored and 
an agreement has been reached with the five federations of the 
tropical area of Cochabamba Department to begin talks during the 
first week of March to fully explain what Mobile Police Unit for 
Rural Areas personnel are doing and to give peasants the chance 
to speak." [passage omitted]
