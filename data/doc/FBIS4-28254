  [Text] New York, June 8 KYODO -- Japan renewed its bid 
Wednesday [8 Jun] to become a permanent member of a revised UN 
Security Council and pledged its support to the reform of the 
United Nations. 
  UN Ambassador Hisashi Owada told a working group that Japan 
intends to work actively for reform of the UN and based on the 
philosophy of reform, will "do all it can to discharge its 
responsibilities as a permanent member of the Security Council 
in the cause of world peace and stability." 
  Owada made the remarks in a closed-door session of the 
working group, which is drafting reform proposals in response to 
the increasing scope and importance of the role of the UN in the 
post- Cold War era. 
  It was the first time for Japan to clearly state its wish to 
become a permanent member of the Security Council before a UN 
body. 
  The council now groups five permanent members, Britain, 
China, France, Russia and the United States, which are the major 
victor nations of World War II, and 10 nonpermanent members 
selected from U.N. member nations for two-year terms. 
  Pointing to Japan's "active" participation in UN-led 
peacekeeping operations in Cambodia, Owada said many members of 
the UN General Assembly and the working group fully recognize 
Japan's bid for a permanent seat on an enlarged council. 
  He expressed support for the working group's intermediary 
report which proposed an increase in the 15-member council to 
20-25 seats. 
  While advocating a limited increase in permanent members, 
Owada said under-represented Asia, Africa and Latin America must 
be allocated more nonpermanent seats. 
  The working group is expected to issue its final report on 
the restructuring and strengthening of the UN and the Security 
Council in September.
