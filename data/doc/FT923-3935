FT  09 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India faces oilseeds deficit
despite bumper crop
INDIA EXPECTS to harvest a bumper oilseeds crop of 20m tonnes or more in the
1992-93 season, up from 18.7m tonnes in the previous year, following good
rains since the start of August. But industry officials still expect the
yield of edible oils to fall short of the country's annual demand of about
7m tonnes by at least 1m tonnes.
The size of Indian imports of edible oils will depend on the availability of
foreign exchange and behaviour of prices on the domestic market - a serious
foreign exchange crisis restricted imports to 177,000 tonnes last year,
compared with 540,000 tonnes in 1990-91.
In the current year India is receiving a donation of 50,000 tonnes of
soyabean oil from the US Agency for International Development and on top of
this it has decided to import 150,000 tonnes of palm olein (the liquid
portion of the oil) from Indonesia. The country also retains the option to
buy 300,000 tonnes of palm oil from Malaysia in the next two years.
India's per capita consumption of edible oils, about 7 kg, is half
Malaysia's.
The federal government aims to make India self-sufficient in oils, which
will call for production of oilseeds to be raised to 26m tonnes a year. The
extra 6m tonnes will have to come from increasing the area under the crops
as well as raising yields, industry officials say. Since 1989-90, the area
under oilseeds has increased from 21.67m hectares (53m acres) to about 25m
ha but productivity has stagnated at about 800 kg a hectare.
Industry representatives are urging that the government should encourage the
cultivation of sunflowers and the planting of red oil palm, both late
entrants to the Indian edible oils sector.
Led by ITC some big Indian companies are promoting the cultivation of
sunflowers, a low irrigation crop that can survive drought and floods.
Farmers in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh are already producing
sunflowerseed, which has an oil content of about 35 per cent, in a big way
and their success has encouraged large scale planting in other states like
Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. As a result Indian production
is expected to rise to 3m tonnes from the present 750,000 tonnes in the next
few years.
The industry is also showing increasing interest in oil palm, plantations of
which could be developed over an additional 575,000 ha in nine Indian
states, including Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, according to a
recent study. Some success with this crop has already been achieved in the
Andamans and Kerala.
During the eighth national plan period (1992-1997), the government proposes
bringing 800,000 ha under oil palm. Use of hybrid seeds and improved
agricultural practices could give a yield of up to 5 tonnes of oil a
hectare, experts claim.
