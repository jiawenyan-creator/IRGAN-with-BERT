  [Text] We now have a flash report that just arrived at our 
studio. Datelined Moscow, it says that on Sunday [20 February] 
the United States assured Russia that in the next two days Serb 
positions in Bosnia will not be attacked, despite the expiry of 
the NATO ultimatum at midnight GMT. This was stated during a 
telephone conversation by U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry 
with Russian Defense Minister General Pavel Grachev.
