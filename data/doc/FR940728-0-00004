 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rulemaking establishes within the Rural 
Development Administration (RDA) a matching fund cooperative 
research agreement program to State Departments of 
Agriculture, State Agricultural Experiment Stations, and other 
related State Agencies to conduct marketing research related 
to cooperatives. This rule establishes the procedures to be 
followed annually in the solicitation of cooperative agreement 
proposals, the evaluation of such proposals, and the award of 
the cooperative agreements under this program. These rules 
are necessary to award the funds appropriated to Agricultural 
Marketing Service in fiscal year 1994 for research on cooperatives under the Federal-States Marketing Improvement

Program. The intended effect is to encourage more research at 
state levels that will enhance the well-being of agricultural 
cooperatives and their members.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Classification 


This rule has been determined to be not-significant for 
purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been 
reviewed by OMB. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


The information collection or recordkeeping requirements 
contained in this regulation have been approved by the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provision of 44 
U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB control number 
05700005 in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). This final rule does not revise or 
impose any new information collection or recordkeeping 
requirement from those approved by OMB. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601612), the undersigned has determined and certified 
by signature of this document that this rule will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. 


Environmental Impact Statement 


This regulation does not significantly affect the 
environment. Therefore, an environmental impact statement is 
not required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 
1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

). 


Intergovernmental Review 


This program is considered a part of ``Technical 
Assistance To Cooperatives'' as listed as No. 10.350 in the 
``Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance''. For reasons set 
forth in the Final Rule-related Notice to 7 CFR part 3015, 
subpart V (48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983), this program is 
excluded from the scope of Executive Order No. 12372 which 
requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local 
officials. 


Civil Justice Reform 


This document has been reviewed in accordance with 
Executive Order (E.O.) 12778. It is the determination of RDA 
that this action does not unduly burden the Federal Court 
System in that it meets all applicable standards provided in 
section 2 of the E.O. 


Discussion of Rule 


A proposed rule was issued on this subject on May 9, 1994 
(59 FR 2380410). No comments were received on the proposed 
rule. The proposed rule, therefore, is adopted as final 
except for the administrative changes discussed below. 
In error, the proposed rule indicated in one place the 
Federal-State Research On Cooperatives (FSROC) Program was 
subject to Executive Order 12372 requiring intergovernmental 
consultations and in another place that it was exempt from the 
Order. The FSROC Program is excluded from the scope of the 
Executive Order No. 12372; therefore, the incorrect reference 
in the proposed rule was removed. 
In addition, the definition of ``State agencies'' eligible 
under the program has been changed to include State 
Agricultural Experiment stations and State Departments of 
Agriculture in the 50 States, the Virgin Islands, and Guam, 
and other appropriate State agencies. The proposed rule 
included experiment stations and State Departments of 
Agriculture in the 50 States and all territories or 
possessions of the United States. The change was made to 
conform to the limiting language of 7 U.S.C. 1626 which 
defines ``state'' to include the Virgin Islands and Guam. The 
Agency has interpreted the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 
(7 U.S.C. 162127) as providing no authority to fund 
marketing research by agencies of other United States 
territories or possessions.
