FT  04 MAR 92 / Letter: The real losers from fraudulent theft claims
Sir, Your article discussing measures being taken by insurers as a result of
increased theft and alleged arson claims ('Sharp rise in theft insurance
payouts', March 2) fails to take into account the problems which innocent
claimants are experiencing because of this tougher line.
The Association of British Insurers states that fire damage payouts last
year were Pounds 1.02bn. Although half of this figure is attributed to
arson, the amount believed to result from policyholders setting fire to
their own property is Pounds 100m - 10 per cent.
Nevertheless, our own experience shows that the proportion of claims which
are investigated for fraud is much higher. The result is that many innocent
policyholders face difficulties in negotiating their claims, with settlement
sometimes delayed to the point where the business's ability to reinstate and
resume trading is seriously impeded.
No-one expects insurers to pay fraudulent claims. But non-fraudulent
claimants - the majority  - have the right to expect value for the premiums
they have spent on protecting their business. It used to be the case that
you were presumed innocent until proved guilty. Some insurers now appear to
be presuming guilt and wheeling in forensic accountants and scientists to
try to prove their case. Often the only way the innocent claimant can win is
by appointing his own professional loss assessor to look after his
interests.
