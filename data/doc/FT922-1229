FT  24 JUN 92 / Herzog urges electoral reform
ISRAEL'S President Chaim Herzog, speaking as the country voted in a general
election, yesterday called for a change in the Jewish state's fragmented
parliamentary system to produce stable government.
He wants to end the situation whereby any of a dozen small parties which
manages to gain a foothold in parliament can hold the larger parties to
ransom in intense coalition bargaining.
The bargaining will commence today and, on past record, could last for weeks
before an administration is formed. Israel's form of pure proportional
representation, with no system of local constituency representation, meant
neither the ruling Likud party nor the opposition Labour party would win a
majority in yesterday's vote.
Labour was hoping opinion poll predictions giving it a lead over the Likud
would prove correct, giving Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the party leader, the
advantage in the process of building a coalition from among some 15 parties
expected to win seats in the Knesset.
Mr Rabin, committed to trading some of the occupied territories in exchange
for peace, wants to accelerate peace negotiations in which the Likud, under
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has rejected the 'land for peace' formula
demanded by the Arab side.
Mr Herzog complained as he cast his vote: 'This is the sixth time in nine
years that I am going through this experience of imposing or granting the
job of forming a government on someone.' An amendment to the system allowing
for direct election of the prime minister, in parallel with the party poll,
is to take effect in the next election. But Mr Herzog said reform should go
further.
