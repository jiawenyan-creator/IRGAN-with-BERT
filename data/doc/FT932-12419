FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Injection of FM1.1bn for Savings
Bank
FINLAND'S government guarantee fund said yesterday it had pumped FM1.1bn
(Dollars 204m) into the Savings Bank of Finland to save it from slipping
below international capital adequacy requirements when it reports interim
results at the end of this month.
The capital injection, made up of FM150m to increase the bank's share
capital and FM950m to purchase preferred capital certificates issued by the
bank, brought to FM13bn the total the guarantee fund has been forced to
invest in Savings Bank, which was formed last year following the merger of
41 small savings institutions.
Savings Bank has been the biggest consumer of aid from the fund, which was
set up to bail out Finland's banking system. The government has yet to
decide on the future of Savings Bank and Skopbank, the savings banks'
central bank.
The fund, which has access to FM40bn for recapitalising the banking system,
said earlier negotiations with Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the country's leading
commercial bank, about a possible merger of the two with KOP were not
proceeding 'at this stage'.
