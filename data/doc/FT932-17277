FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: London Securities incurs Pounds 38m loss
LONDON Securities, the property and investment company which has undergone a
financial restructuring, reported a loss before tax of Pounds 37.6m for the
18 months to end-September.
That compared with a deficit of Pounds 37.9m for the preceding 12 months.
Losses per share came out at 57.7p (58.9p).
The voluntary arrangement approved in October limited the rights of recourse
of creditors as at October 16 to the company's assets at that time.
The company now had a working capital facility to cover the current year's
overheads, cash deposits of some Pounds 200,000, no borrowings or creditors,
low overheads and substantial tax losses, Mr David Pearl, chairman, said.
Nu-Swift had taken up its full entitlement on new shares and now holds a
29.2 per cent interest.
