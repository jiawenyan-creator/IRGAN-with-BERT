<F P=106> ["Summary" of remarks by Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok </F>
Tong at an interview with NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN President 
Takuhiko Tsuruta in Singapore on 16 May; by Yasufumi Watanabe 
from Singapore] 
  [Text] The Future of China's Economy 
  Economic development will continue in China. China needs 
basic social infrastructure, such as airports, power plants, 
communications facilities, ports, and roads. As development 
gets under way, the consumer market will also grow. 
<H5>  China's Military Threat </H5>
  I think it is but natural for Southeast Asia to feel that 
China is a threat. As economic development progresses, there is 
concern that economic power may be transformed into military 
power. Our strategy is to promote economic interdenpendence. 
That way, the neighboring countries will also come to 
understand China's actions. 
<H5>  Membership of Vietnam and Myanmar [Burma] in ASEAN </H5>
  First, nations wanting to become members of ASEAN will have 
to sign a treaty of peace and cooperation. If Vietnam becomes a 
member of ASEAN, it will also have to join the ASEAN Free Trade 
Area (AFTA), and be obliged to open up its market. The 
appropriate time for membership will have to be decided through 
discussions between the two sides. Right now, we do not have a 
specific target time in mind. 
<H5>  Relations With Taiwan </H5>
  I cannot comment on whether I have met with Taiwan President 
Li Teng-hui today (16 May). Singapore and Taiwan have good 
relations in trade, shipping, and aviation. We also have 
defense ties. 
<H5>  Confrontation Between Asia and Western Countries on Human </H5>
Rights 
  I am against linking this to economic issues. Of course, 
human rights issues are important. The advanced nations of the 
West tend to put emphasis on individual rights. We give more 
importance to the right of the people to live as a collective. 
This needs to be discussed at an appropriate venue, such as a 
human rights forum. Trade has to be tackled separately. 
<H5>  NAFTA </H5>
  There has not been any formal invitation for the ROK and 
Singapore to join the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA). However, we welcome the willingness to make NAFTA an 
organization embracing the whole Pacific region, including South 
Korea and Singapore. The important thing is that the United 
States will not only be concerned with Mexico and Chile, but 
will also take East Asia across the Pacific into consideration. 
Of course, it would be a problem if NAFTA only takes in 
Singapore and the ROK and then closes its doors. We will 
welcome NAFTA if it is an open organization aimed at reducing 
trade barriers. The important thing is to open its doors also 
to other Asian nations. 
<H5>  The Era of U.S. Disarmament and Asian Security </H5>
  We need to ask the United States to continue its military 
presence in Asia. Two great powers, Japan and China, exist in 
Asia. If the United States withdraws from this region, the two 
sumo wrestlers may start their fight in the Asian arena. We 
hope the United States, Japan, and China will continue to 
maintain a balanced coexistence with the other Asian states. 
<H5>  U.S. Policy Toward Asia </H5>
  The unofficial Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
conference summit in Seattle last year, by itself, shows the 
importance the United States attaches to Asia. I have no 
complaints about such a geopolitical strategy on the part of the 
United States. However, when it comes to how things are 
actually done, the United States does not completely support the 
policies of Asian countries. (From the letter of Assistant 
Secretary of State Winston Lord), we understand that, at least, 
a senior U.S. official thinks that something has to be done 
about problems between the United States and Asia. 
<H5>  Japan's Contribution to Asia </H5>
  The important thing is for Japan to continue its own 
economic 
growth. China and Vietnam, two economies which have been closed 
until recently, are now trying to join the world economic 
framework. Japan, together with ASEAN, can help these two 
countries by providing investment. This way, our region can 
achieve significant growth in the next 20 to 30 years. 
<H5>  UN Sanctions Against the DPRK </H5>
  Japan and China's persuasion can be very effective. North 
Korea derives substantial income from Japan, and China provides 
the DPRK with fuel and power plants. China has the veto right 
in the United Nations. It is necessary to first make China 
understand that the imposition of economic sanctions is the 
appropriate weapon.
