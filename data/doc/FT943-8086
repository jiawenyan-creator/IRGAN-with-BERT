FT  19 AUG 94 / Brussels offers hope on disabled scheme
The European Commission yesterday conceded that Britain's priority suppliers
scheme for the disabled may breach European Union law but claimed it could
be adapted to conform to the rules.
Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the single market commissioner, said the
commission was still considering the legality of the scheme, which allows
companies employing mainly disabled workers to match the lowest tender for
government contracts.
Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, withdrew government support for
the scheme last week after receiving legal advice that it conflicted with an
EU directive on public procurement.
In a preliminary statement, Mr Vanni said national procurement regimes
giving preference to specified tenderers could be contrary to community
rules if they discriminated against bidders from other member states. But
such regimes could be made 'in certain conditions' to conform to procurement
rules if they pursued a legitimate objective and were extended to similar
bidders from other member states.
Commission officials conceded that Mr Portillo was right to claim the scheme
left the British government open to an action in the European Court of
Justice by unsuccessful bidders for contracts.
The Department of Employment said Mr Portillo was bound to act on the advice
of the government's legal advisers, who continued to maintain that the
scheme was illegal. 'The bottom line is that whatever the commission says,
the legality of the scheme is a matter for the European court,' it said.
In a letter to Mr Portillo, Mr Vanni denied that the commission had
expressed any opinion on the application of the procurement directive before
receiving a letter from the government earlier this week.
