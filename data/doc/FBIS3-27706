Republic of Korea (DPRK), briefed reporters late tonight on the 
contents of the package solution it reached here with the United

on 
the suspension of the U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises 
"Team Spirit '94"; 
  -- The inspection necessary for the continuity of safeguards 
as agreed upon between the International Atomic Energy Agency 
and the DPRK on February 15 should begin and be completed within 
the period agreed by the two sides; 
  -- The working-level contacts between the North and South 
should resume in Panmunjom with a view to materializing the 
exchange of their special envoys; and 
  -- The DPRK and the United States should announce that the 
third round of DPRK-U.S. talks would begin on March 21 in Geneva. 
  The four points should be implemented simultaneously, Ho 
stressed.
