FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Richards deficit cut to Pounds 71,000
After a fourth quarter which turned out to be 'more difficult than expected'
Richards, the Aberdeen-based textile company, ended the year to September 30
with a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 71,000.
The outcome, which compared with a loss of Pounds 1.99m last year, was
struck on turnover down from Pounds 71.9m to Pounds 67.8m. Of this,
acquisitions accounted for Pounds 1.75m and discontinued operations for
Pounds 144,000 (Pounds 3.35m).
Positive aspects to the results were a Pounds 362,000 gain from the sale of
properties, the release of a 1992 provision amounting to Pounds 663,000
relating to the withdrawal from linen manufacture and a bomb compensation
claim, and a Pounds 50,000 profits contribution from Toweropen, acquired in
August.
The directors said that Kyle Knitwear had again suffered a significant loss
and this company was now up for sale.
After a tax credit of Pounds 201,000 (Pounds 750,000) earnings per share
came out at 0.54p (5.33p losses). The final dividend is cut to 1.93p (2.93p)
making a total for the year of 3p (4p).
