FT  11 JUN 94 / Little Rutland hails big step to independence
Rutland yesterday moved within reach of reasserting its right to a place in
the schoolchild's catalogue of superfluous facts as the smallest county in
the UK.
Citizens celebrated the impending triumph of history over administrative
convenience: their successful rebellion against Leicestershire. Symbols of
independence such as road signs were never pulled down anyway - the
traveller could never not know of Rutland.
One celebration cup was Rutland's Return. Mr Andrew Reid, publican at the
Old Plough in Braunston, spent most of the afternoon making the drink. For
six shillings old money or 30p in new money - for one day only at 1974
prices - he offered a mixture of orange juice, lemonade, a melon liqueur
called Midori and cucumber.
'A light summer drink,' Mr Reid said.
Ruddles Brewery said it was preparing a marketing drive for its bitter. It
could bring out a celebration ale next year, if independence is consummated.
Politicians smiled over the success of a campaign to emphasise the
separateness of the people who live on a plateau which looks down on
Leicestershire and Lincolnshire and feels part of neither. Only 10 per cent
of Rutlanders work in Leicestershire. They had no doubt of the response when
the Local Government Commission asked Rutlanders whether, after 20 years
with Leicestershire, they might like to be on their own.
The county has the same boundaries as in the 11th century, Rutlanders like
to recall, but the old-new county has not been completely isolated from
change. It might look like the rural idyll of England with its rolling
farmland and manicured villages, but the biggest landholdings have broken
up.
Farmers and commuters with smart cars now live together. This is Range Rover
and green wellie country. But, as one recently arrived but fiercely
chauvinistic Rutlander said haughtily: 'We may have wellies here, but they
have got mud on.'
