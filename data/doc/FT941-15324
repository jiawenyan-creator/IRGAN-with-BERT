FT  15 JAN 94 / International Company News: Alusuisse bid succeeds
Alusuisse-Lonza, the Swiss aluminium and packaging group, has succeeded in
its CDollars 555m (USDollars 420.5m) takeover bid for the Canadian packaging
group, Lawson Mardon.
Alusuisse said it had received more than 98 per cent of the Lawson shares
before the expiration of its public offer.
The addition of Lawson, with annual sales of CDollars 1.28bn, would roughly
double the size of Alusuisse's fast-growing packaging division.
Mr Georges Schorderet, Alusuisse treasurer, said Lawson would be integrated
quickly into the division.
