  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota -- Cuban President Fidel Castro 
today flatly denied that there is any truth to the report that 
Ivan Marquez, Alfonso Cano, and Monsignor Nel Beltran met in 
Cuba during the second half of January. 
  Castro said that the report is nothing but more pressure by 
groups interested in hindering the sale of Colombian petroleum 
to Cuba and hastening the break of diplomatic relations between 
the two countries. 
  Castro made the statement prior to an official announcement 
in which he will respond to a Colombian Foreign Ministry request 
for clarification on the Solidarity Summit in Cuba. He pointed 
out that a Protestant prelate who currently lives in Medellin 
attended this meeting on behalf of Colombia. 
  Meanwhile, Ernesto Samper Pizano, the official presidential 
candidate of the Liberal Party, reacted by advising against any 
desperate actions and saying that we should listen carefully to 
the explanations given by the Cuban Government.
