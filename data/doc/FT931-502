FT  30 MAR 93 / Concern at future cost of water bills
OFWAT, the water industry regulator, yesterday said that more than half of
the respondents to a consultation paper it published last August, were
'seriously concerned' about the affordability of future water bills if
required improvements are implemented, Bronwen Maddox writes.
Nearly a third of the 112 responses to Ofwat's August 1992 consultation
paper felt more scientific evidence of health benefits was needed to justify
improvements. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, who has warned that
bills could double by 2005 on top of the rate of inflation, said of the
required improvements: 'Everything is going at a fantastic pace in the water
industry and that is reflected in (the rise in) bills.'
The 10 Ofwat regional customer service committees also announced yesterday
they would form a joint national council to make customers' concerns better
heard in Whitehall and Brussels.
