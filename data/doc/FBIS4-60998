  [Text] Yerevan, 2 May (SNARK) -- For about a month the 
railroad communications of Armenia with outer world has been 
broken off. Press service of the Armenian Government told SNARK 
that as a result of the sharp rise in water-level at the Khrami 
river in the Marneuliaskiy region, the central pier of 70-meter 
railroad bridge declined for two meters. 
  In connection with danger for trains a resolution to stop 
railway traffic was made. According to preliminary forecasts, 
trains from Armenia to Georgia and back will not run for about a 
month. Other railroad communications through Azerbaijan and 
Turkey have not worked for a long time because of blockade of 
Armenia by these countries. The representatives of the Armenia 
Government have left for the place of incident and are 
organizing the transportation of loads, first of all grain and 
fuel, from Georgia to Armenia with trucks.
