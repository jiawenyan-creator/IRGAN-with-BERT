FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Guinness buys back Haig brand
Haig, once the leading Scotch whisky in the UK, has returned to Guinness's
drinks portfolio after eight years with Whyte &amp; Mackay Group, a subsidiary
of American Brands.
After Guinness took over Distillers in 1986, the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission required Guinness to reduce its share of the UK Scotch market to
25 per cent by selling Haig and nine other brands to Whyte &amp; Mackay.
Guinness retained Dimple Haig, the upmarket version famous for its 'pinch'
bottle, and the Haig brand elsewhere. It is the leading Scotch in Germany,
Greece and Ireland.
A brand dating back to the 19th century, Haig was the UK market leader until
the 1960s. It then suffered from a supermarket price war and competition
from other whiskies such as Bell's, Teachers and Famous Grouse. Industry
observers believe only some 30,000 cases of Haig were sold in the UK last
year, compared with 3m for Bell's, the market leader.
'We have no plans to make it a major brand in Britain,' Guinness said. 'We
will continue to focus on Bell's but there may be a niche marketing
opportunity with Haig.'
Guinness declined to give a value for the deal, but it is thought to be
under Pounds 5m.
