P.M. BRIEFING; 
IBM'S EARNINGS TUMBLE 74% 
International Business Machines Corp. today announced that its fourth-quarter 
earnings fell 74%, largely because of previously announced restructuring costs 
aimed at making the world's biggest computer company more profitable. 
IBM said earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31 totaled $600 million, or 
$1.04 a share, compared to $2.3 billion, or $3.97 a share, a year earlier. 
Fourth-quarter revenue totaled $20.5 billion, up 2.3% from $20 billion. 
The company attributed the decline mostly to a previously announced 
$2.4-billion charge against its fourth-quarter results to reflect the expenses 
of restructuring its U.S. business, which has been in a prolonged slump. 
IBM's earnings are scrutinized because they reflect broader trends in the 
computer business. The company is the largest manufacturer of of information 
processing equipment and systems and is a historical leader in shaping the 
direction of the industry. 
For the year, IBM said earnings fell 40% to $3.8 billion, or $6.47 a share, 
from $5.8 billion, or $6.47 a share, in 1988. Revenue totaled $62.7 billion, up 
5.1% from $59.7 billion.
