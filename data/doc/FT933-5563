FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: East Asiatic profit
EAST Asiatic, the Danish trading company with substantial interests in
south-east Asia, reports a return to profits after net financial items of
DKr42m for the six months ended June, against a loss of DKr17m a year
earlier.
However, the net result, after the costs of discontinued operations and
income from divestments, was a loss of DKr97m compared with an DKr18m loss
in 1992. The group sold several operations during the half year, notably
container shipping and Plumrose food processing operations.
The disposals strengthened group finances, with net interest bearing debt
falling to DKr4.30bn at end June from DKr5.95bn at end December.
