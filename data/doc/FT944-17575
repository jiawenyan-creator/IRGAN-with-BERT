FT  07 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: No sense in provision
Sir, Surely the suggestion that banks should automatically make provision
for new loans being granted does not make sense ('Plan to smooth bank
profits endorsed by top supervisor', October 1). Banks should either require
increased margins or, if that proved impossible for market reasons, quit
lending altogether until reduced supply pushes margins up again. Automatic
provisions would merely be an acknowledgement of the inability of banks to
price credit risk correctly.
