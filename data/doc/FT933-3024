FT  16 SEP 93 / Court suspends Brazilian tax
Brazil's Supreme Federal Court yesterday suspended the collection of the
country's newest tax, the Provisional Tax on Financial Transactions, after
ruling it was unconstitutional, reports Angus Foster in Brasila.
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister, said the decision would
force the government to cut spending. It had been intended to levy the tax
on all financial transactions and had been seen as important in terms of
improving the federal revenue position.
