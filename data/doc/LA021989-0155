NEWPORT DUNES AQUATIC PARK WORK STARTED 
Work has started on the $15-million, first-phase redevelopment of the 75-acre 
Newport Dunes Aquatic Park at 1131 Back Bay Drive in Newport Beach. The park is 
owned and managed by Newport Dunes Partnership of San Diego. 
The five-year, $45-million project will be completed in three phases. The first 
phase, scheduled to be finished July 4, will focus on the renovation of 
existing facilities. 
The park serves recreational vehicles, provides for boat launching and storage 
and offers a salt-water swimming lagoon. 
Upon completion, Newport Dunes will include an expanded marina, a restaurant 
and a 275-room hotel. 
Wimberly Allison Tong &amp; Goo of Newport Beach is the architect. The 
contractor is M.H. Golden Co. of San Diego.
