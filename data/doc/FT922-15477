FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Hyundai founder to relinquish
shareholding
MR Chung Ju Yung, the founder and former chairman of Hyundai, the Korean
conglomerate, says he will relinquish his shareholder's rights in the
group's 14 concerns to concentrate on his new-found political role.
Mr Chung is likely to transfer most of his shares, valued at Dollars 2.6bn,
to his younger brother, Mr Chung Se Yung, the Hyundai chairman.
Mr Chung said, however, he may sell some of his shareholding to raise funds
for his new political party, the Unification National Party (UNP), which
gained a pivotal parliamentary position in last week's National Assembly
elections.
The disposal of the shares is also aimed at increasing the UNP's popular
appeal by distancing it from Hyundai.
