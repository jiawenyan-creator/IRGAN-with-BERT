<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Campaign for Increased Condom Use To </F>
Reduce Number of Abortions"] 
  [Excerpts] Finland is in the vanguard as far as the number 
of abortions is concerned. Last year 9.7 abortions were 
performed per 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 19, about 
half the number that were performed in the 1980's. In the United 
States the corresponding figure is five times higher. The goal 
of the Population and Family Welfare Federation's new campaign, 
which is aimed at ninth graders, is to cut the number of 
abortions in half again by the year 2000, and at the same time 
reducing the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases [STD's].

<H5>  Condoms Accepted </H5>
  Associate Professor Pekka Lahteenmaki, senior medical 
officer 
of the Family Welfare Federation's family planning clinic, feels 
that today's young people are increasingly accepting condoms as 
a contraceptive. Some 14 million condoms are used in Finland 
annually. [passage omitted] 
  Condoms are the only contraceptive method that also provide 
protection against sexually transmitted diseases. And the latest 
disease statistics show that cases of gonorrhea and syphilis 
have declined, while chlamydia has increased somewhat. 
  There were 575 HIV cases at the end of last year, of which 
149 had developed AIDS, and 106 of these had died. Statistics 
are unavailable for condyloma and herpes. [passage omitted]
