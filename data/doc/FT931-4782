FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Govett advances 31% to Dollars 45.2m
GOVETT, the financial services company, increased its pre-tax profits by 31
per cent from Dollars 34.6m to Dollars 45.2m (Pounds 31.8m), in a year when
it altered its accounting practices to meet US standards.
The main effect of the change was on the group's US insurance subsidiary.
Instead of reporting earnings on an embedded value basis, which brings
forward a percentage of future profits into the current year, US standards
(GAAP) concentrate on cash flows. The result was to reduce stated 1991
profits by Dollars 12.5m.
The group decided to make the change following its issue of an American
Depositary Receipt Programme in the US and its plans to seek a quote on
Nasdaq, the US over-the-counter share market.
Despite the change, the insurance company was the engine of profits growth
in 1992, increasing profits from Dollars 4.8m to Dollars 19.1m. The group's
institutional and mutual fund management business also increased profits,
from Dollars 12.6m to Dollars 14.3m.
However, there were falls in profits from Dollars 6.5m to Dollars 6m at the
venture capital arm (because it completed fewer deals); and investment
income also fell, because of lower interest rates and a stagnant stock
market, from Dollars 14.1m to Dollars 9.8m. Funds under management grew
during the year from Dollars 5.2bn to Dollars 6bn.
The company's share price, 107p at the interim stage, has risen sharply to
close at 232p yesterday, helped by the revival of the dollar, a rerating of
the fund management sector and the higher profile of the group in the US.
Total net income for the year was Dollars 49.1m (Dollars 38m). After
corporate expenses of Dollars 3.9m (Dollars 3.4m), and tax of Dollars 11.2m
(Dollars 6m), profits were Dollars 34.1m (Dollars 28.6m). Fully diluted
earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 45 cents (36.1 cents).
The final dividend of 14.5 cents (13.5 cents) makes a total of 24 cents (22
cents).
