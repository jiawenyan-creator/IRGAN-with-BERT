DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLANNERS VOTE TO LIMIT LANDFILL'S EXPANSION 
The Los Angeles County Planning Commission on Thursday sent its final 
recommendation on Sunshine Canyon Landfill expansion plans to the Board of 
Supervisors, which will make the final decisions in late November or December. 
The commission voted 3 to 0 to allow dump owners, Browning-Ferris Industries, 
to expand the landfill capacity by 17 million tons, rather than the 70 million 
tons the company requested. 
The commission did not close the door on later expansions but recommended that 
additional capacity increases require a new round of county approvals. 
Thursday's vote finalized a tentative commission decision that was made on 
Sept. 27. 
In addition to the reduced dumping capacity, the commission approved the 
removal of about 4,000 oak trees in the canyon, which would be eliminated from 
county maps as an ecologically sensitive area. 
Dump opponents are expected to appeal the recommendation to the Board of 
Supervisors and ask members to deny Browning-Ferris any permit to expand. BFI 
officials will ask the board to grant them the full-expansion permit. 
County planners said the board will further review the proposal and hear more 
testimony from opposing sides before their final vote.
