SUSPECTS IN 14 BANK HOLDUPS RUN OUT OF LUCK IN OXNARD 
Two suspected bank robbers believed by the FBI to have robbed a total of 14 
banks in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties during the last month were arrested 
this week -- one after a routine traffic stop and the other after a bicycle 
chase in Oxnard. 
Gary Auer, agent-in-charge of the FBI's Ventura County office, identified the 
two suspected robbers as Bruno Gilbert Torres, 24 and Raymond E. Hilliard II, 
22, both of Oxnard. He said Torres is suspected in 10 robberies, including 
seven in Ventura County, and Hilliard is a suspect in four robberies. 
Torres tried to escape when he was stopped for a routine traffic violation by 
Oxnard police, but ran into the back yard of an off-duty Ventura County 
sheriff's deputy who held him at gunpoint until arresting officers arrived, 
Auer said. 
Hilliard was surrounded by the FBI and Oxnard police at an Oxnard motel and 
tried to escape on a bicycle, Auer added. He said Hilliard reached speeds of 25 
m.p.h. on the bike as he tried to escape in a scene reminiscent of the bicycle 
chase scene in the movie "E.T." 
The recent surge of bank robberies in Ventura County, which the FBI links 
primarily to Torres and Hilliard, has put the year's total bank robberies for 
the county at 34, surpassing last year's total of 31, Auer said. 
Auer, who took charge of the FBI's Ventura County office in 1986, said bank 
robberies that year totaled 71. The number was reduced to 60 in 1987 and 
dropped to 31 last year before's this year's increase.
