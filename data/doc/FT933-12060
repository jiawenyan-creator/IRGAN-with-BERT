FT  27 JUL 93 / Third no-confidence vote in India
THE Indian government faced its third no-confidence motion in 25 months
yesterday, writes Shiraz Sidhva.
It was sponsored by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), with the support
of the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), the National Front and the Left Front.
A day of acrimonious debate followed the motion, with the Congress (I)
staunchly defending Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, in the face of
allegations that he had accepted a Rs10m (Pounds 214,000) pay-off from Mr
Harshad Mehta, the main accused in the Bombay financial scandal.
Senior parliamentarians such as Mr Jaswant Singh of the BJP and Mr George
Fernandes of the Janata Dal launched a blistering attack on the government
for its policies of 'drift, lack of leadership, corruption, and economic
mismanagement'. Socialist parties and the right-wing BJP, which has become
the largest opposition group in India by capitalising on Hindu nationalism
and fundamentalism, appeared to want to drive Mr Rao out of power for
different reasons.
Legislators will debate for two days and Mr Rao will be allowed to defend
himself tomorrow before the vote.
Mr Fernandes spoke at length to the House about how Congress (I) had 'sold
out' to large multinationals such as the US company, Cargill, whose proposed
salt project near Kandla port in Gujarat would lead to 25,000 people losing
their jobs and pose a security threat. He also accused the government of
covering up the Bofors gun scandal, six years after it broke.
