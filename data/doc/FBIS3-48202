  [Text] Seoul will provide grants worth 31.8 billion won 
(some $40 million) to developing nations this year, up 20 
percent from the 26.5 billion won last year, the Foreign 
Ministry said yesterday. 
  The increase reflects the government's will to actively 
promote economic cooperation with other countries as part of 
efforts for Korea's internationalization, it said. 
  The money will be mainly used in helping solve global 
problems such as poverty and environmental pollution, 
strengthening cooperation with Asian-Pacific countries and 
supporting the efforts of former socialist countries to shift to 
free market system, the ministry said. 
  The Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), an 
affiliate of the ministry, is in charge of implementing various 
programs of cooperation. It was inaugurated in April 1991. 
  To be specific, the agency will invite 858 trainees from 101 
developing nations this year as well as sending 97 experts to 56 
nations to share the experience in economic development, it said. 
  It will also dispatch 76 volunteer workers to 11 countries, 
including Indonesia and Mongolia, and send 18 medical doctors to 
17 nations, most of them in Africa. 
  The agency will spend $13.7 million in project-type programs 
and emergency aid for natural disasters to 98 countries and four 
international organizations, $3.26 million in building 
vocational training centers in Indonesia and Sudan and $4.46 
million in 17 development research programs in eight Asian 
nations.
