FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Acil expects to reject NZ bid
AUSTRALIAN Consolidated Investments (Acil) says holders of 60 per cent of
its shares will reject an ADollars 127m (USDollars 96m) takeover offer from
Rossington Holdings, a bid vehicle owned by two companies associated with
Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur, writes Kevin Brown.
The board did not identify shareholders who have undertaken to reject the
offer. However, about 60 per cent of the company is effectively controlled
by Australian banks. The rest is owned by companies formerly controlled by
Mr Alan Bond.
