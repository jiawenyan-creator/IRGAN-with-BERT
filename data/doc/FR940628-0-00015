<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document establishes time-limited tolerances for residues of the insecticide 1-[(6-chloro-3-pyridinyl)methyl]-

N

-nitro-2-imidzolidinimine and its metabolites (common name ``imidacloprid'') in or on dried hops at 3.0 parts per
million (ppm), milk at 0.05 ppm, and meat, fat, and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 0.2
ppm, with an expiration date of 1 year after the beginning of the effective date of a final rule based on this proposal.
EPA is issuing this proposal on its own initiative.

EFFECTIVE DATE:

 This regulation becomes effective June 17, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of May 16, 1994 (59 FR 25431), EPA issued a proposed rule that on its own initiative and pursuant to section 408(e) of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), EPA proposed a time-limited tolerance for residues
of imidacloprid on dried hops at 3.0 parts per million (ppm). EPA recently reclassified dried hops as a raw agricultural
commodity (59 FR 9167; Feb. 25, 1994 and 59 FR 17487; April 13, 1994). EPA is establishing the tolerance because it has
granted a petition for an emergency exemption under section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act, 7 U.S.C. 136p, for the use of imidacloprid on hops in the States of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho; imidacloprid
is used in other countries that export hops to the United States; and the database for imidacloprid is relatively complete.
The most significant data gap for establishing a permanent tolerance for imidacloprid on dried hops is a third field-residue
trial. Given the relatively low risks presented by imidaclorprid, EPA does not believe that the missing data will
significantly change EPA's risk assessment. Nevertheless, EPA is establishing a 1-year time limitation on this
tolerance for a full residue data base to be available in making a decision on a permanent tolerance. 


There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the time-limited tolerance will protect
the public health. Therefore, the time-limited tolerance is established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
