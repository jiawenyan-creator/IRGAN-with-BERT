  [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- A forum was held in the 
Great Hall of the People here today to mark the 45th anniversary 
of the publication of GUANGMING DAILY, one of China's major 
newspapers mainly serving the intelligentsia. 
  Chinese leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi and Li 
Ruihuan 
sent their inscriptions for its anniversary to encourage the 
newspaper to play an active role in uniting intellectuals, 
upholding fine traditions, attaching importance to education and 
science, respecting knowledge and talents, and advocating truth. 
  Ding Guangen, member of the Political Bureau of the Central 
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, telephoned GUANGMING 
DAILY to express his congratulations. 
  Published in Beijing on June 16, 1949, GUANGMING DAILY is 
focused on economic and social issues that intellectuals are 
most keen on. 
  To celebrate its 45th birthday, the newspaper has decided to 
build a small library in a village in Hebei Province with 3,900 
books donated by its staff.
