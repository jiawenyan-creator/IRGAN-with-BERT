SIDELINES; 
JACKSON ON REDS DISABLED LIST 
The Cincinnati Reds placed left-handed starter Danny Jackson on the 15-day 
disabled list today, retroactive to Tuesday, because of recurring stiffness in 
his left shoulder. 
It is the second time in recent weeks that Jackson, 28, has been sidelined with 
shoulder ailments. He is 4-2 with a 2.95 earned run average in 14 games this 
season, 13 of them starts. 
The Reds replaced Jackson on the roster by calling up left-hander Chris Hammond 
from the Class AAA Nashville Sounds, where Hammond is 14-1 with a 2.17 ERA. 
Hammond is to join the Reds in time for Friday night's twilight double-header 
in Cincinnati against the Pittsburgh Pirates.
