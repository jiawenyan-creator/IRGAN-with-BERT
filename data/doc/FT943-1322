FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: The AIM is excellence - The market
proposed to replace the USM
Stock exchanges everywhere face a common problem: the need to protect
investors while creating an environment where small companies, in
particular, can raise capital at an affordable price.
In Britain, the London Stock Exchange earlier this month produced a plan
which tries to strike a balance. Its Alternative Investment Market (AIM),
intended to replace the Unlisted Securities Market when it expires at the
end of 1996, will allow the UK's smallest companies to seek an exchange
listing without meeting any minimum requirements.
There will be no minimum level of capitalisation, no minimum level on the
amount of shares in public hands, no minimum trading record requirement and,
most controversial of all, no requirement for a 'sponsor' - usually, an
investment bank which checks the documents accompanying a flotation to see
they are accurate.
The trading and reporting requirements for AIM companies will, broadly, be
similar to those of others on the stock exchange. Once listed, they will
have to disclose information in much the same fashion as companies on the
exchange's official list.
The question being debated is how to encourage investors to put capital into
small companies without raising the cost of complying with investor
protection regulations to unrealistic proportions.
Specialists in small companies say investing in the sector is high risk,
anyway. 'But you have got to make a distinction between rules which protect
against business risk and those which protect against fraud,' says Marc
Cramsie, head of corporate finance at stockbroker Singer and Friedlander.
The latter are the most important, he adds.
Brokers, venture capitalists and others have looked with envy across the
Atlantic to the Nasdaq market's small capitalisation stocks listing. In
particular, the participation of US retail investors at this end of the
stock market is striking.
Nasdaq argues that its own minimum entrance requirements for listing have
been a crucial factor in encouraging investors into small companies. 'If you
are going to maintain the confidence of investors and confidence in the
markets, you need to maintain some minimum standards,' says Joe Hardiman,
its chief executive.
Getting an initial spot on Nasdaq's small companies list requires
registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, total assets of
Dollars 4m, an initial flotation of 100,000 shares with a total minimum
value of Dollars 1m, and at least 300 shareholders. Like the AIM, though,
there is no formal requirement for a sponsor with the duty to provide a 'due
diligence' review of information filed.
As a practical matter, Hardiman says, 'only a tiny fraction' of Nasdaq Small
Cap companies have no sponsor because each is required to have two
market-makers (share wholesalers) prepared to buy and sell the shares in all
market conditions. He points out that no sane market-maker would agree to
take on a company without having checked it out thoroughly.
The proposed AIM market will require only one market-maker, a rule which
also could prompt the majority of companies which list there to use a
sponsor as well.
Cramsie argues that the danger of dropping the requirement for a sponsor is
that companies will seek listings on the AIM mostly to have a
publicly-quoted price for their shares - useful for those seeking a public
valuation or wishing to reward employees with profit-sharing arrangements.
Those genuinely seeking new capital will join the official list or, worse,
choose to list in another country.
'It's going to be very useful for a lot of companies simply to have a
trading price somewhere for their shares,' Cramsie says. 'But the stock
exchange really should try to make the AIM a market where people actually
are going to raise money.'
Brian Winterflood, managing director of Winterflood Securities - which
specialises in small company stocks - says he is uneasy about whether AIM
rules will be too loose to encourage retail investors to take part in the
long run.
In particular, he adds, the goal of the AIM should be to create a US-style
share-buying public instead of one which chooses 'race-courses and bingo
halls'. He fears that if too many AIM-listed companies turn out to be run by
people with dubious credentials, the entire market will be discredited.
David Jones, chairman of Sharelink, a share-dealing service for private
investors, says he believes his clients want to invest in small companies.
Moreover, he feels the absence of minimum requirements for companies seeking
a listing should not be a deterrent so long as investors understand the
nature of the market.
'What private investors like is clarity,' Jones says. 'The proposition that
you need lots of regulation to encourage them is untested. We think the
proposed AIM will make private investors much keener to go into this
sector.'
Instead of more regulation, Jones suggests that better communications
between shareholders and company directors would improve matters. He feels
directors should meet more often with investors to answer their questions
about trading conditions. 'We need a completely new approach to
communication,' he stresses.
Jones adds that, if anything, new rules designed to protect investors by
limiting opportunities for insider dealing serve only to frustrate this
heightened level of communication.

The table, compiled by Touche Ross, sets out how the tax treatment of
investors in the three different stock markets varies at the moment.
Investing in companies quoted on Rule 4.2 has considerable capital gains tax
advantages, but they are not considered suitable for a personal equity plan.
Both Unlisted Securities Market and Rule 4.2 companies have inheritance tax
advantages not shared by companies with a full quote. AIM's position remains
to be clarified.
