  [Text] The idea has surfaced within the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] of appointing former Foreign Minister Michio 
Watanabe as LDP vice president to strengthen the party 
leadership in a bid to recapture power. 
  The idea has unofficially been discussed, mainly by 
executives of the Watanabe faction. Some leaders in other 
factions have also made remarks supporting it. Meanwhile, 
although Watanabe has not yet decided whether he should accept 
the offer, he reportedly intends to accept if a consensus is 
formed within the party. 
  It is said that while the idea is aimed at strengthening the 
party's leadership to recapture power, it is also considered a 
means to keep Watanabe in the party amid speculation that he has 
been strengthening ties with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Chief Secretary Ichiro 
Ozawa. However, LDP President Yohei Kono and some other party 
leaders have expressed strong opposition to the idea, saying it 
might cause a struggle for leadership over party operations. 
Thus, it is uncertain whether or not the idea will be adopted 
in the end.
