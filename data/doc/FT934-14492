FT  16 OCT 93 / Record award for sex bias case
A WOMAN on Merseyside won a record Pounds 17,127 compensation for sex
discrimination at an industrial tribunal yesterday - breaking for the first
time the Pounds 11,000 limit which was abolished in August.
Wirral Hospital Trust was found to have discriminated against Mrs Kathleen
Holden, a medical laboratory scientific officer who works part-time for the
trust. The trust failed to offer to transfer Mrs Holden to full-time work.
