PRACTICAL VIEW; 
TURNING A MINUS INTO A PLUS 
Have you bought a jacket for $200 one week only to see it marked down to $150 
the next? 
A survey of local stores reveals that you can collect the difference. 
* Saks Fifth Avenue: refund of the difference between sale and regular price 
can be collected within three weeks of purchase. 
* The Broadway: customers with receipts can collect the difference if the 
garment goes on sale within 10 days of the date of purchase. Neiman Marcus and 
I. Magnin have the same policy. 
* Robinson's: refunds difference within one week of purchase. 
* May Co. and The Limited refund a difference at any time. CINDY LaFAVRE YORKS
