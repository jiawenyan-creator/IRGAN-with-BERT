FT  17 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Johannesburg - Other Markets
The South African markets will be focusing on the release of the major gold
producers' quarterly results this week, including Anglo-American,
Johannesburg Consolidated Investments and Gengold, writes Mark Suzman .
The country's other major mining house, Gold Fields of South Africa,
reported last week. It showed improved profits and attributed them to a
fall-off in the election-related unrest and work stoppages that had dented
the June figures. Following the successful resolution of this year's wage
negotiations, the other mining companies are also expected to have boosted
production on the quarter, which should cheer investors.
Whether the results have a significant effect on the stock market, however,
is largely dependent on the fluctuating gold price. In recent months, the
bourse's All Gold Index has been rising steadily on the back of an improving
gold price.
However, after the metal failed to breach the psychologically important
Dollars 400 an ounce barrier, speculators have started to sell and in the
past two weeks it has since tumbled back below Dollars 390 on the back of
profit-taking. Gold shares have largely followed the metal's downward trend
and are currently well off their September peaks.
