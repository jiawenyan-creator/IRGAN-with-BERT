  [Excerpt] Italian companies have agreed to buy more Thai 
products as part of a counter-trade deal involving the Thai 
Defence Ministry's purchase of helicopters worth 3.4 billion 
baht, Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon said after returning 
from Rome yesterday. 
  Mr. Uthai declined to give more details about what the 
Italians would do, saying only that the outcome of the 
negotiations exceeded expectations. He said he would brief the 
Defence Ministry and Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai 
Phanitchaphak about the talks. 
  The agreement will require Cabinet approval. 
  A Commerce Ministry source who was with the delegation in 
Rome said that Alinia, the Italian company in the process of 
selling the G-222 helicopters, had agreed to buy Thai products 
worth about 680 million baht or 20 percent of the sales volume. 
  The source said the company accepted Thai proposals to 
increase trade in eight products: frozen chicken, rubber, 
tapioca flour, toys, ceramics, sport shoes, plastic products and 
rubber gloves 
  Mr. Uthai claimed that the Italian talks should serve as a 
standard for Thai government agencies in future deals with other 
countries. 
  The Government last year had delayed approving the purchase 
of the transport helicopters and asked the Commerce Ministry to 
try to sell more Thai agricultural products to offset the trade 
deficit. [passage omitted]
