FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lower costs help margins rise at VCI
VCI, one of the UK's largest independent publishers of videos and
pre-recorded music, yesterday reported an 18 per cent rise in operating
profits in its first interim results since flotation.
Shares lifted 1p to the issue price of 150p after the company announced
operating profits of Pounds 1.01m (Pounds 856,000) on turnover of Pounds
23.3m (Pounds 23.5m) for the six months to June 30.
Mr Ivan Dunleavy, finance director, said improved margins were the result of
reduced manufacturing costs and increased sales of higher-priced products.
The company has also concentrated on its own video productions, which cut
royalty payments.
VCI, whose video rights include 'Thomas the Tank Engine' and 'Mr Bean', is
now marketing a range of CD-video titles and budget price computer software.
Its flotation in June raised about Pounds 28m net to clear Pounds 25.1m of
debt after a management buy-out in 1989. Interim net interest costs fell to
Pounds 944,000 (Pounds 1.96m) and the company is now ungeared.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 4.03m to Pounds 67,000, following a Pounds
5.15m redemption of debenture last year. However, a pro forma calculation
reveals pre-tax profits of Pounds 938,000 (Pounds 370,000).
Earnings per share fell to 0.3p (70.6p), although pro forma earnings rose to
2p (0.6p). There is no interim dividend, in line with the company's listing
particulars.
