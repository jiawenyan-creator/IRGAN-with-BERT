<F P=106> [Report by Pavlo Kushch: "For Full Happiness -- President </F>
Charodeyev?"] 
  [Text] During last June's political strike, Donetsk 
miners, having learned that the current generation will hardly 
survive on the promised five dollars [per month], were demanding 
early presidential elections. As of late April, the desire to 
hold early presidential elections remained unchanged -- the 
Abakumov Donetsk mine nominated Ukrainian Supreme Council 
Chairman Ivan Plyushch as a candidate for the office of 
Ukrainian president. 
  As for representatives of local parties and movements, they 
still hesitate to nominate their own candidates, except for 
left-wing forces. The Liberal Party of Ukraine [LPU] is not 
doing this, because its leader, Ihor Markulov, has not yet 
reached the age required by legislation to run for president. A 
candidate whose position is closest to that of the party can 
count on support from LPU. It has not been ruled out that 
Leonid Kuchma will become such a candidate. According to the 
well-known rule that from all miseries people elect the least 
painful, the former prime minister was most often named at an 
expanded coordinative conference of the Civil Congress of 
Ukraine [HKU]. Nevertheless, the HKU has not yet decided which 
presidential candidate to support, despite the fact that it was 
considering the nomination of former People's Deputy Oleksandr 
Charodeyev as the party's candidate. 
  Meanwhile, political parties are paying much attention to 
the 
local elections. The lead, as always, is held by the 
communists. For instance, at its oblast conference, the LPU 
nominated current Oblast Council Chairman V. Chuprun (former 
chief of the LPU Donetsk Oblast Committee), as a candidate for 
the office of oblast council chairman. Rayon committees of the 
Communist Party are not wasting time either. As candidates for 
rayon council chairmen, they are primarily nominating people 
with impressive party experience.
