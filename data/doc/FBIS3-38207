  [Text] Strasbourg, France, Jan 28 (AFP) -- The Council of 
Europe decided Friday [28 January] to give Bosnia-Herzegovina 
special guest status at its parliamentary assembly, the 
assembly's chairman Miguel Angel Martinez said here. 
  Exact details of Bosnia's participation and the number of 
its 
delegates to the next assembly session of the pan-European body 
next April have not been worked out. 
  Martinez said the assembly wanted to be able to talk to all 
sides in the Bosnian conflict to assist the Council of Europe in 
its efforts to bring peace to the region. 
  "It also shows our solidarity towards the principal victims 
of the Bosnian drama, and above all to those who hold most to a 
multi-ethnic, democratic and free Bosnia, that is to say a 
European Bosnia-Herzegovina," Martinez added. 
  On Monday Martinez expressed regret at the total break in 
relations between the Council of Europe and the rump Yugoslavia, 
which he said had deprived the Council of means of bringing 
pressure to bear on Belgrade. 
  But there was no question of going back on the Council of 
Europe's earlier decision to suspend the membership of Serbia 
and Montenegro, he added. 
  He said the Council had rejected demands to suspend or even 
withdraw completely Croatia's status as special guest because of 
its role in Bosnia, where the mainly-Moslem government is 
fighting Croat and Serb irregular forces. 
  The parliamentary assembly did not wish to burn its bridges 
with Croatia, cutting off the possibility of contact, 
information and pressure, Martinez said.
