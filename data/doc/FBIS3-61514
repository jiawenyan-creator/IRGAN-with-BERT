  [Abstract]This study was motivated by the chief distinction 
of of Chernobyl-related contamination from the standpoint of 
soil-plant migration of radionuclides, i.e., its spatial and 
aggregate heterogeneity. An independent statistical index of 
contamination heterogeneity was offered: the Bravais-Pearson 
coefficient of linear correlation between soil and dry plant 
biomass radioactivity for demonstration of ``hot'' particles as 
an indication of relative extent of contamination. Accumulation 
of _b_ emitter radionuclides was studied in the above-ground 
portions of rye, oats, barley, wheat and peas raised in 
1.5-liter containers with sod-podzolic soil taken in the 10-km 
zone of the Chernobyl disaster, as well as effects of soil 
micromycetes (Cladosporium cladosporioides and Penicillium 
rosco-purpurent) cultivated in Czapek's liquid mineral medium on 
dissolution of hot particles. Cesium-137 and Cerium-144 
radionuclides were absorbed at variable rates by the plants, 
depending on stage of growth. The rates were higher when in 
subsequent planted specimens, mainly in rye and oats, affected 
by their precursors. Experimental data on radionuclide migration 
were obtained with the use of this index, and its usefulness was 
validated. Figures 2, tables 2, references: 8 Russian, 2 Western.
