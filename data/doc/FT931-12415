FT  28 JAN 93 / Investment into Romania up
DIRECT foreign investment in Romania doubled in 1992 and is expected to show
a similar increase this year, the country's development agency said
yesterday.
Foreign companies committed Dollars 269.1m last year, bringing total foreign
investment to Dollars 537.8m since the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime in
December 1989.
Western European groups continue to provide most of the capital, accounting
for 69 per cent of investment with North America providing 15 per cent.
Shell, one of four western companies to be awarded oil exploration
contracts, made the biggest single investment in 1992, worth Dollars 44m.
However, Italian companies, which have targeted textiles, engineering and
metallurgy, are the top investors with Dollars 70.5m, according to Romanian
Development Agency figures.
Despite uncertainty over the new government's commitment to far-reaching
economic reform, the RDA is confident investment will double again in 1993.
With funding from the European Community's Phare programme of aid to eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, the agency recently hired Saatchi and
Saatchi, the advertising agency, as part of moves to improve the country's
image with investors and publicise its fledgling privatisation scheme.
'There is a relative lack of information about Romania and investment
opportunities here. Countries like Hungary have promoted themselves more
than we have, and it shows. We intend to remedy that this year,' said Mr
Florin Bonciu, RDA director general.
In addition, the state-funded RDA has proposed amendments to the foreign
investment law to enable foreign companies to own land in Romania and
repatriate profits.
