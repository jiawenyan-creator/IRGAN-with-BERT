FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Melville share deals suspended
Shares in Melville Group were suspended at 4 1/2 p yesterday after the
exhibition services and interior fittings company warned that it was in
talks which might lead to the sale of a substantial part of its business.
In November, the company reported pre-tax losses for the year to June 30 of
Pounds 1.18m, against a restated Pounds 18.6m deficit.
The result was after a fall in exceptionals and provisions from Pounds 12.7m
to Pounds 930,000.
