FOR THE RECORD 
Misidentified -- In an article Thursday on a police gang raid in Santa Paula, 
The Times incorrectly identified Michael Banuelos, 38, and Steven Bracamontes, 
23, as suspects in a May 18 drive-by shooting. Police said the two men are not 
suspects in the shooting but were arrested for parole and probation violations. 
Banuelos was also incorrectly identified as a suspected gang member.
