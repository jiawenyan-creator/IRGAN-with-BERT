  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 14 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government, trying to decide what to do about imported rice, is 
studying the possibility of selling it to North Korea, which is 
said to be suffering a food shortage. 
  South Korea is expected to open its rice market to imports 
under the Uruguay Round agreement, but as imported rice will 
have an adverse effect on the nation's farmers, the government 
has been considering using foreign rice to make rice wine or 
other products such as rice cookies for export. 
  Government officials said Friday [14 January] that although 
South Korea is self-sufficient in rice, it is forced to import 1 
percent of the nation's rice consumption, or 50,000 tons, a year 
from 1995 under the Uruguay Round agreement. 
  The government has already decided not to sell imported rice 
on the domestic market. 
  One senior government official said that the Economic 
Planning Board, Foreign Ministry and Agriculture-Fisheries 
Ministry are actively debating problems, including the method of 
imports and the uses of foreign rice. 
  Since the Seoul government regards transactions with North 
Korea as internal trade and the amount of imported rice is 
small, it believes that there is no problem under international 
trade regulations, the official said. 
  South Korea exported 5,000 tons of rice through a private 
company, Chonji Trading, in July 1991.
