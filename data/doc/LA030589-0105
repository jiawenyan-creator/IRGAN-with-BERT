The New York state Board of Parole said Bernhard H. Goetz must serve the full 
one-year prison sentence he got for illegally carrying the gun he used to shoot 
four teen-agers on a New York City subway in 1984. Releasing Goetz after just 
two months in jail "would deprecate the seriousness of the crime and undermine 
respect for the law," the board said in Albany. Monday was the earliest Goetz 
could have been released. Edward Elwin, the board's executive director, said 
the decision meant Goetz would have to serve his full one-year sentence, minus 
any time off for good behavior, unless he can persuade a court to overturn the 
board's ruling. Goetz, 41, was convicted on the gun charge but acquitted of 
attempted murder, assault and reckless endangerment charges. He began serving 
his sentence Jan. 13 .
