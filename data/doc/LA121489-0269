POLL FINDS DESIRE FOR CAR-POOL INCENTIVES; 
TRANSPORTATION: SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HALF OF WORKERS SAY THEY WOULD CONSIDER 
RIDE-SHARING IF THEY GOT A SUBSIDY AND A GUARANTEED LIFT HOME. 
A slim majority of employees who drive alone to work in Glendale might switch 
to ride-sharing if they were guaranteed a ride home in an emergency and paid a 
subsidy, according to a survey released last week by the Glendale 
Transportation Management Assn. 
The survey of 5,092 employees at nine key Glendale work sites, conducted by 
Commuter Transportation Services, is the first comprehensive study of employee 
travel habits in the city. 
It found that almost 77% drive alone to work. But slightly more than half those 
surveyed -- 51.6% -- would consider ride-sharing, at least occasionally, if 
given the right incentives. 
The other 48.4% said they will not car-pool no matter what incentives are 
offered. Most of those said that they need a car for personal use before, 
during or after work or that they work irregular hours. 
The guaranteed ride home in the event of a family emergency or unexpected 
change in work hours is critical to persuading drivers to leave their cars at 
home, said Carol Redfern of Commuter Transportation. "People fear getting 
stranded." 
Of those who drive alone, 38% said they would consider car-pooling if they knew 
they had alternative transportation, such as a voucher for taxi fare. Redfern 
said a similar program has boosted the success of a ride-sharing program at 
Warner Center in the west San Fernando Valley. 
An additional 24% of the drivers said they would give up their car at least a 
few days a week if they were given monetary incentives by their company, such 
as extra pay, a discount on gasoline purchases or gift certificates. 
Other incentives that drew support were reserved parking spaces in the most 
desirable locations and free parking for car-poolers. Only 7% said they would 
consider switching if they had to start paying for parking that they now get 
free. 
More than 19% said they simply need help in finding partners. 
Commuter Transportation Services operates Commuter Computer under several state 
and local grants that are being used to encourage development of traffic 
management associations, which are employer organizations formed to combat 
traffic problems. It conducted the two-month survey and provided 
recommendations on implementing a ride-sharing program at no cost to the 
transportation association. 
The Glendale association, a consortium of public and private employers, 
incorporated in October and has been awarded a $60,000 state grant to initiate 
a program to persuade lone commuters to get out of the driver's seat and to 
either walk, ride with others or pedal bicycles to work, said Tom Horne, city 
traffic and transit administrator. 
Association members include the city of Glendale and 17 other major employers, 
including Security Pacific Automation, Walt Disney Imagineering, Fidelity 
Federal, Glendale Federal Bank and the Glendale Galleria. 
At the association's meeting last Thursday, Redfern urged that the group take 
an active role in transportation issues at the local and state level. "With the 
names of the companies you have in this association, you have a lot of clout," 
Redfern said. "You need to get into an advocacy role." 
She suggested, for example, that the group could press for building code 
amendments that reduce the number of parking spaces required at new office 
buildings, forcing more employees to share rides to work by making it more 
difficult to find parking spaces. 
The Glendale association is one of about 50 cooperative groups that have formed 
nationwide in recent years -- partnerships between business and local 
government to help solve transportation problems associated with rapid urban 
growth, according to the Urban Transportation Monitor, a trade journal. 
The Glendale group plans to mail letters within a few weeks to executives of 
several dozen other major employers, inviting them to take part. The cost of 
membership has not been determined, and an executive director must still be 
hired. 
However, all companies with 100 or more employees have been ordered by the 
South Coast Air Quality Management Board to submit plans by January to 
encourage ride-sharing among employees. More than half of the plans submitted 
to date have been rejected as inadequate, according to AQMD officials. 
Glendale association members hope to meet the stringent air quality standards 
by working together. Companies that fall short of the rules face potentially 
stiff fines, Redfern said. 
The next meeting of the association is 3 p.m. Jan. 18 at Glendale Federal Bank, 
401 N. Brand Blvd.
