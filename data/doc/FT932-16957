FT  02 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forte lower
The implications of the share suspension of Queens Moat Houses continued to
unfold, with the focus shifting to Forte, Britain's biggest hotel group. One
prognosis had Forte satisfying its long-declared interest in mainland Europe
by picking up Queens Moat hotels there, should the embattled group be forced
to sell. A rights issue by Forte would then become necessary, suggested
market voices.
Queens Moat's demise also refocused attention on the wider problems of the
hotel market and again threw up worries for Forte's dividend when results
are announced in two weeks' time. Forte fell 8 to 184p on big turnover of
10m. Ladbroke Group lost 5 to 176p - a scrip issue announcement came after
the market had closed.
Brewer Bass appeared to be playing down suggestions that it might be
interested in buying some Queens Moat properties, telling analysts it was
not interested in owning more hotels. Bass shares responded favourably,
rising 9 to 555p.
