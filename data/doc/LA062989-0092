OXNARD CITY GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS SET 
The fourth annual Oxnard City Golf Championships will be held July 8 and 9 at 
the River Ridge Golf Club in Oxnard. 
A field of over 150 have registered for the tournament, which is open to all 
amateur players with established handicaps. The deadline to sign up is Friday. 
"River Ridge is one of the most challenging courses in the area and it's not an 
easy score," club spokesman Chris Tormey said. Some top golfers are registered 
for the Championship Flight (0-5 handicap), including defending champion Dave 
Fernandez of Woodland Hills, who shot a tournament-record par 144 last year. 
Other championship flight golfers include Oxnard's Paul Stankowski, who attends 
the University of Texas-El Paso, and Strawberry Festival champion Doug Righter 
of Ojai. 
Competition will be divided into four gross and handicap flights, with 
individual medal play. In addition to the Championship Flight, there are: A 
Flight (6-11 handicap); B Flight (12-18); and C Flight (19-36.)
