FT  29 JUN 94 / Parliament lifts Tapie immunity
The French National Assembly yesterday voted to lift the parliamentary
immunity of businessman-turned-politician, Mr Bernard Tapie, in connection
with an inquiry into commercial and tax fraud. MPs approved by 465-10 and
462-10 two separate judicial requests to allow Mr Tapie to be investigated
over accusations connected with his private yacht. The opposition Socialists
abstained and walked out to jeers from the right. The assembly had
previously lifted Mr Tapie's immunity last year in connection with another
probe. Mr Tapie, an MP for the Left Radicals Movement, denied any wrongdoing
and told the assembly he was victim of a political plot.
