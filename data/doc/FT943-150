FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: High milk prices leave Waterford
Foods lower
Waterford Foods, Ireland's second-largest co-operative, reported a 16 per
cent slip in interim pre-tax profits from IPounds 11.4m to IPounds 9.6m
(Pounds 9.5m) because of high Irish milk prices and pressure on prices for
cheese, Waterford's main product.
The strength of the punt, which has been near parity with sterling, also
posed problems for the group, cutting into export margins.
Operating margins fell from 5.9 to 4.3 per cent while turnover was up 7.4
per cent to IPounds 363m, with increased sales in all three operating
divisions.
However, the group says it is confident of a better performance for the full
year and has embarked on a rationalisation programme, aimed at cutting costs
by IPounds 12m, which analysts expect to result in a significant year-end
provision.
As part of the restructuring Waterford is to close its dairy plant Didsbury
and transfer production to its main plant at Hyde in Manchester with the
loss of about 100 jobs.
Turnover in dairy products, including cheese, was up 4 per cent at IPounds
171m. The consumer products division, including liquid milk and fresh
products, reported a 10 per cent rise in turnover to IPounds 145m.
Earnings per share dipped 25 per cent to 3.87p but the group is raising the
interim dividend 5 per cent to 1.25p. Waterford shares closed 5p down at
80p.
Analysts are expected to trim full-year profits forecasts from IPounds 28m
to IPounds 22m taking account of the restructuring provision.
