  [Text] The Austrian National Bank will reduce the discount 
and the Lombard rate by 0.25 percent each beginning of tomorrow. 
Thus, the new discount rate will be 5 percent, the Lombard rate 
6 percent. 
  This step is justifed by the "good liquidity" of the markets 
and the trust documented by the high reserves. It is also 
intended to support the beginning economic recovery, the 
Austrian National Bank announced. The Gomex rate remains 
unchanged at 5.5 percent. 
  Previously, the German Bundesbank had reduced its discount 
rate by 0.5 percent to 5.25 percent.
