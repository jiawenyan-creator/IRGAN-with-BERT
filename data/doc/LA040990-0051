LAKERS USE A LATE 19-3 RUN TO WIN 
Magic Johnson scored five of his 19 points during a 19-3 fourth-quarter run 
that lifted the Lakers to a 116-109 victory over the Denver Nuggets Sunday. 
It was the sixth straight victory for the Lakers, who now have a four-game lead 
over Detroit in the race for the best record in the NBA and a homecourt 
advantage in the playoffs. 
The Lakers trailed, 94-87, before the decisive run, which ended with the Lakers 
ahead, 106-97, after a tip-in by A.C. Green with 3:42 left. 
Denver pulled within six on a three-point play by Fat Lever, who led Denver 
with 31 points and 11 rebounds, but the Nuggets didn't threaten the rest of the 
game. 
James Worthy led the Lakers with 28 points and Green had 26 and 18 rebounds. 
Michael Adams scored 22 for the Nuggets. 
The Lakers built theur winning margin by making 29 of 33 free throws. Denver 
made 16 of 19 free-throw attempts. 
Denver led for most of the first period before the Lakers went up 26-25 on a 
follow shot by Green with 1:47 remaining. But Walter Davis and Lever hit 
consecutive baskets to give Denver a 29-26 lead at the end of the quarter. 
A revised ruling before the start of the second half by referee Hue Hollins 
took a point away from Johnson and the Lakers, which made their halftime lead, 
60-56. 
Hollins said a technical foul erroneously was called on Denver's Joe Barry 
Carroll when it should have been a personal foul. Hollins instructed the 
scoring crew to remove the point from the Lakers' total before the start of the 
second half. 
The Lakers controlled most of the third period, leading 75-63 with 6:22 
remaining. It was still 81-72 with 3:53 to play in the third before Denver went 
on an 18-4 run to lead 90-85 going into the fourth quarter.
