FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Medco buys rest of Medical
Marketing
MEDCO Containment Services, the US medical services group, is to buy the
45.8 per cent of Medical Marketing Group it does not already hold at Dollars
27.25 per share, Reuter reports. The transaction is valued at Dollars
156.6m.
Medical Marketing and Medco, joined in the announcement by Merck, the US
health care group, also said the proposal included an agreement with a
Medical Marketing shareholder group suing Medco in Delaware Chancery Court
after an initial bid of Dollars 25 per share for Medical Marketing stock,
made on October 13.
The understanding, the companies said, calls for plaintiffs to settle their
litigation 'based upon, among other things, the terms of the merger
agreement'.
The merger is subject to approval by shareholders and the Delaware court,
and is also contingent on completion of the Medco-Merck merger.
