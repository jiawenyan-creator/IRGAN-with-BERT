<DOCTITLE>Granite State Gas Transmission, Inc.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>


June 24, 1994.



Take notice that on June 16, 1994, Granite State Gas Transmission, Inc. (Granite State), 300 Friberg Parkway, Westborough,
Massachusetts 01581 filed Second Revised Sheet No. 25 in its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, proposing
changes in rates for effectiveness on July 16, 1994.

According to Granite State, its filing is submitted to passthrough to its customers the take-or-pay buydown and buyout
costs directly billed to Granite State by Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee).

Granite State states that, on May 31, 1994, Tennessee filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP94261000
to adjust its recovery for the buydown and buyout of purchase gas contract obligations consistent with the Stipulation
and Agreement (the Cosmic settlement) approved by the Commission in Docket Nos. RP83119, 

et al.

 According to Granite State, its tariff sheet reflects the changes in Tennessee's allocation of take-or-pay costs
to Granite State and also complies with the requirements of the reallocation of costs to small customers pursuant
to Order No. 528A.

According to Granite State the proposed rate changes are applicable to its jurisdictional sales services formerly
rendered to Bay State Gas Company and Northern Utilities, Inc. and to a sale to a direct customer, Pease Air Force Base.
Granite State further states that copies of its filing were served upon its customers and the regulatory commission
of the States of Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said filing should file a motion to intervene
or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 in
accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214).
All such motions or protests should be filed on or before July 1, 1994.

Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve
to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to the proceeding or to participate
as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's rules. Copies
of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.
