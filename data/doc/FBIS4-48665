  [Text] After taking control of Rwanda's international 
airport and Kanombe military barracks, the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF] has pledged to cooperate with the United Nations in 
order to facilitate humanitarian activities of the United 
Nations. The airport in Kigali has been a contested area and 
the UN activities have been disrupted a number of times. The 
United Nations has had to cancel a number of flights to Rwanda 
due to the heavy fighting at the airport. The United Nations 
has been trying to negotiate for neutrality of the airport with 
the RPF and the Rwandan Government forces. Now that the airport 
is no longer contested the question of negotiating neutrality at 
the airport may no longer be relevant. What is needed now is for 
the United Nations to work out modalities with the RPF 
concerning the use of the airport by the United Nations.
