Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans and 
Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; 
Redesignation of the Huntington West Virginia Ozone Nonattainment 
Area to Attainment and Approval of the Area's Maintenance Plan 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving a redesignation request and a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of
West Virginia. This SIP revision approves a maintenance plan for the Huntington area including contingency measures
which provide for continued attainment of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The intended
effect of this action is to approve a redesignation request of the area from moderate ozone nonattainment to ozone
attainment and to approve a maintenance plan for the area. This action will also remove any sanctions imposed on the
Huntington area under section 179 of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (the Act). This action is being taken in accordance
with the Clean Air Act (CAA). 


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE:

 This rule will become effective on December 21, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On September 6, 1994 (59 FR 46019), EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) for the State of West Virginia.
The NPR proposed approval of the maintenance plan and redesignated the Huntington area to attainment for ozone. The
formal request for redesignating the Huntington moderate ozone nonattainment area to attainment and the maintenance
plan SIP revision were submitted to EPA by the State of West Virginia on November 12, 1992. On February 22, 1994 and August
10, 1994 West Virginia provided clarifying revisions to its maintenance plan. 
The maintenance plan for the Huntington area provides for emissions 
tracking, triggers to implement contingency measures, and a schedule for implementing the measures. In the event
that exceedances of the ozone NAAQS are measured such that nonattainment is indicated at any of the three monitors
in the Huntington-Ashland area or in the event that periodic emissions inventory updates or major permitting 
activity reveals that excessive or unanticipated growth in 
ozone precursor emissions has occurred or will occur, West Virginia 
will accordingly select and adopt additional control measures. 



The specific requirements for the redesignation and maintenance plan and the rationale for EPA's proposed action
are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. Two letters supporting the redesignation and maintenance plan
were received, and one adverse comment letter was received on the NPR. Following are the comments that were submitted
relevant to EPA's action to redesignate the Huntington area and to approve the maintenance plan. EPA responses follow
each comment. 




Comment 

#



1: 

The Commonwealth of Kentucky supports the request to redesignate the West Virginia portion of the Huntington-Ashland
moderate ozone nonattainment area to attainment. In conjunction with Kentucky's request to redesignate the Kentucky
portion of the Huntington-Ashland moderate ozone nonattainment area to attainment, West Virginia's maintenance
plan and contingency measures meet the U.S. EPA's criteria and guidance to ensure that the air quality in this area
will be preserved. 



Response 

#



1: 

EPA acknowledges this comment. 



Comment 

#



2: 

Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) wishes to strongly support the proposed redesignation to ozone
attainment of the Huntington, West Virginia area (Wayne and Cabell Counties). In view of the fact that there have been
no violations of the ozone standard in the Huntington area since the 1989 ozone season, it is appropriate for this redesignation
to be approved. The maintenance and contingency plans should assure continued attainment will be maintained. 



Response 

#



2: 

EPA acknowledges this comment. 



Comment 

#



3: 

The Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition (OVEC) commented that contingency measures of the maintenance plan are
not adequate to assure attainment since the exact causes of ozone nonattainment in this area are not well understood.





Response 

#



3: 

As stated in the NPR, EPA believes that the criteria of sections 107(d)(3)(E)(iii) and 175A have been met by the Huntington
area. The Huntington area has not recorded an ozone violation in the last five years. During this period, permanent
and enforceable reductions in ozone precursors occurred. As part of their maintenance plan, West Virginia will carefully
track precursor emissions. If for any reason, a substantial increase in emissions occurs or if ozone violations are
recorded, the contingency measures in the maintenance plan allow the State to choose the most appropriate measure(s)
to deal with the situation. The combination of emissions tracking and available contingency measures will allow
the State to mitigate future problems should they occur. 



Comment 

#



4: 

OVEC also commented that the first two measures of the contingency plan which include extending the VOC/RACT requirement
to sources previously excluded and requiring more stringent controls and/or emissions offsets for new sources should
be implemented immediately. 




Response 

#



4: 

The Huntington area has not had any ozone violations for five years. Permanent and enforceable reductions in ozone
precursor emissions have occurred, and negative growth is expected in the area. This information indicates that
the area will continue to maintain the ozone standard in the future, and that the contingency measures do not need to
be implemented at this time. 




Comment 

#



5: 

OVEC also commented that NO

X



 emissions estimates in the area appear to be low, and more study is needed to determine if additional NO

X



 RACT requirements would help reduce ozone. 


Response 

#



5: 

The NO

X

 emission estimates for the Huntington area were determined through the application of current EPA emission inventory
guidance. Therefore, these emission estimates are considered by EPA to accurately represent NO

X 

emissions for the area. If substantial increases in emissions of NO

X

 

were to occur, the appropriate contingency measure(s) would be used to reduce the emissions of this ozone precursor.
