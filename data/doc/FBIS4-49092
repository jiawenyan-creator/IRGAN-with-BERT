  [Text] Xian, May 3 (XINHUA) -- The Xian branch of the Bank 
of China (BOC) has provided 4.5 billion yuan in loans to 
foreign-funded enterprises since 1990, which has brought about 
678 million U.S. dollars in foreign trade volume. 
  According to an official of the branch bank, the bank has 
also provided 210 million yuan in loans and various financial 
services to Xian-based enterprises. They include trust and 
investment, securities and credit card services. 
  The branch, which was established only five years ago, has 
opened accounts for 70 percent of the local Sino-foreign joint 
ventures 
  The Xian Xigu Optical Fiber Co. Ltd, a Sino-Japanese joint 
venture, is one such enterprise. It was established with the 
help of 26 million yuan and 500,000 U.S. dollars in loans from 
the branch bank. The company earned 37 million yuan in profits 
from domestic sales and over one million U.S. dollars from 
exports in the first year of its formal operation. 
  Another two Sino-foreign joint ventures set up by the Xian 
printing plant have become major profit-makers in this capital 
of northwest China's Shanxi Province, with the support of loans 
from the local BOC branch.
