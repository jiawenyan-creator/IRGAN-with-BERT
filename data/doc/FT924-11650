FT  24 OCT 92 / French trade in surplus
France's trade balance swung sharply back into surplus last month, helped by
a rise in exports of Airbus jets, a traditionally erratic factor in French
trade flows, William Dawkins reports from Paris.
The French trade surplus reached FFr3.7bn (Pounds 440m) in September, after
a surprise FFr3.04bn deficit in August, according to seasonally corrected
figures from the customs directorate.
France has now recovered three-quarters of the FFr160bn it committed to
defend the parity of the franc during last month's currency crisis,
according to the French finance minister, Mr Michel Sapin, Barry Riley
reports from Paris
