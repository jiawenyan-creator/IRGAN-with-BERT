FT  10 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Belgian exchange to start
trading stock options
BELFOX, the Belgian derivatives exchange opened last year, will start
trading stock options on Friday. Initially, the exchange will trade put and
call options on two Belgian stocks, Petrofina, the oil company and Delhaize,
the food retailer.
The exchange intends to introduce options on four other shares - Electrabel,
the electricity utility, Solvay, the chemicals company, Societe Generale de
Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company, and ACEC-Union Miniere, the
metals group.
Futures and options on the Bel-20 index of Belgian stocks are also planned
at a later date.
Options trading was originally scheduled to start in February, but was
postponed due to systems problems.
The screen-based exchange started trading futures on a notional Belgian
government bond last year.
