FT  23 FEB 93 / Money Markets: French futures falter
RENEWED tension within the European exchange rate mechanism prompted a sharp
fall in French franc futures yesterday as dealers struggled to maintain
D-Mark parity, writes Peter John.
In the Matif, the Pibor contract for March delivery plunged 22 points from
the open to end the day at 88.49 on heavy turnover of nearly 14,600
contracts. The fall indicated a quarter-point rise in three month money to
11.5 per cent ahead of the country's general election on March 17.
There was an element of correction after firmness last week but there was
also a new wave of ERM jitters prompted by the Bank of Spain's intervention
to support the peseta.
Nevertheless, the market is convinced that Paris will cut rates following
the election and the June contract remained steady yesterday, easing only
two basis points to 91.08 on turnover of 20,650 contracts.
Euromark futures traded within a tight range with the March contract
settling slightly easier at 91.93 and June marginally firmer at 91.97.
Away from the ERM uncertainty, short sterling was firm with March nudging
ahead by 3 basis points to 94.05 and June adding four points at 94.65.
There was also relief among UK interbank dealers as concerns that the
liquidity shortage would be around Pounds 1bn proved unfounded and the Bank
of England began the day with a forecast shortage of only Pounds 450m.
Among the main factors affecting the position were the take-up of Treasury
bills and paper maturing in official hands which was set to remove Pounds
347m from the system. Bills for repurchase by the market were expected to
take out Pounds 1.343bn and bankers' balances below target Pounds 35m.
Partly offsetting this, exchequer transactions were set to add Pounds 535m
and a fall in note circulation Pounds 745m.
The Bank of England did not offer early assistance but provided Pounds 280m
at midday, buying band one bank bills at the established 5 7/8 per cent
rate.
By the afternoon, the forecast shortage was revised to around Pounds 550m
and the Bank bought a further Pounds 270m of bills.
The Bank also announced a weekly rollover rate of 6 1/8 per cent on a
temporary facility it first made available last September to aid liquidity
after currency upheavals.
