FT  07 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian production forecast
to stabilise
AUSTRALIAN GOLD production is forecast to stabilise at about 230 tonnes over
the next five years, after reaching an estimated 235 tonnes in 1991-92, the
Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics said yesterday.
Production of 235 tonnes in 1991 was above levels forecast last year and was
achieved in spite of the removal of a tax break for gold companies and low
world prices.
Mr John Cairns, the bureau's principal research officer on ferrous and
precious metals, said production forecasts for the next five years had been
raised because of expectations of stronger nominal prices, based in turn on
forecasts of a recovery in world economic activity.
He thought that Australian gold export earnings would rise moderately to
about ADollars 3.8bn (Pounds 1.56bn) this year and to more than ADollars
3.5bn in 1992-93, before easing slightly in real terms in the three ensuing
years.
He added that foreign sourced gold was expected to remain a significant
component of the total export value and could exceed forecast levels if new
refining contracts could be obtained.
Meanwhile Mr Campbell Anderson, the chief executive of Renison Gold Fields
Consolidated, said that mine production this decade would be driven largely
by gold consumers, principally those buying jewellery.
