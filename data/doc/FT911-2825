FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): What are my rights?
I HAVE recently received an increase in my company pension. The note
enclosed with this information states: 'The increase will be applied to that
part of the pension you receive from the company group pension and assurance
scheme which is in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension, as the latter
is already inflation-proofed from the state retirement age by the
government.'
I would appreciate it if you could explain to me what this means and how
much is the guaranteed minimum pension.
The term 'guaranteed minimum pension' is used to describe that part of your
company pension which replaces the pension you would have received from the
State Earnings Related Pension Scheme if you had not been contracted out.
This GMP is fully index-linked in line with the Retail Price Index and the
increases get paid by the state in the form of an addition to your state
pension.
This is the reason why your employer only needs to provide cost of living
increases for the balance of your company pension over and above GMP. This
is standard practice where pension increases are awarded.
Each person's GMP will vary according to the amount of state earnings
related pension that he or she would have achieved depending upon earnings,
age and the number of years in which contributions were paid.
