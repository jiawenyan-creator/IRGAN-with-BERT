TARZANA WOMAN ARRESTED IN DEATH OF MILLIONAIRE HUSBAND 
A Tarzana woman who said she shot and killed her millionaire husband because 
she thought he was a burglar was in jail this morning on suspicion of murder, 
authorities said. 
Carole Evelyn Mellinger, 48, was arrested after the shooting at 8 p.m. 
Wednesday in the 19700 block of Komar Drive, Los Angeles police said. 
Her husband, Brainerd Lee Mellinger, 69, was found shot to death in the den of 
the home in the exclusive hillside area of Tarzana, Detective Rick Swanston 
said. 
Police said the victim owned Mellinger Co., an import-export business located 
in Woodland Hills, and often appeared on promotional advertisements on 
cable-television that dealt with establishing import-export businesses. 
Swanston said Brainerd Mellinger was shot several times in the chest shortly 
after he came home. When police arrived, his wife said she had shot him because 
she "mistook" him for a burglar, Swanston said. 
But "inconsistencies in her statements" and other evidence in the house led 
police to arrest Carole Mellinger, Swanston said. She was being held without 
bail at the Van Nuys jail.
