<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Afghan Factions Reject Pakistani </F>
Initiative and Escalate Fighting"] 
  [Excerpt] Kabul, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The warring 
Afghan factions yesterday rejected a Pakistani peace initiative 
and pledged to continue the fighting "until complete victory." 
  The aim of the Pakistani initiative, which was supported by 
the United States and Russia, was to make arrangements for an 
unconditional cease-fire to be followed by peace talks in 
Islamabad within one week. 
  A spokesman for 'Abdol Rashid Dostam said that there would 
be 
no cease-fire agreement before interim President Borhanoddin 
Rabbani resigns and leaves the country. 
  Interim Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, whose Hezb-e 
Eslami Party and Dostam's Uzbek militias are now allies, 
supported Dostam's position. 
  There was no categorical rejection of the Pakistani 
initiative by the opposing side led by former Defense Minister 
Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, but a spokesman for Mas'ud said that Dostam 
would be excluded from any future talks and that Hekmatyar would 
be invited as a faction leader and not as interim prime minister. 
  There was fierce fighting in Kabul yesterday in which 
missiles and aircraft were used. [passage omitted]
