SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On February 28, 1992, United Contact Lens, Inc., Lynnwood, WA 98036, submitted to CDRH an application for premarket
approval of the UCL55 and UCL55 TORIC (ocufilcon C) Soft (hydrophilic) Contact Lenses. The UCL55
and UCL55 TORIC (ocufilcon C) Soft (hydrophilic) Contact Lenses are indicated for daily wear for the correction
of visual acuity in not-aphakic persons with nondiseased eyes that are myopic (near-sighted) and hyperopic (farsighted).
The spherical lens may be worn by persons who may exhibit astigmatism of 1.25 diopters (D) or less that does not interfere
with visual acuity. The toric lens is indicated for the correction of astigmatism of 7.00 D or less. In addition, the
lens is to be disinfected using a chemical lens care system. The application includes authorization from N  N
Contact Lens International, Inc., Lynwood, WA 98046, to incorporate information contained in the approved PMA and
related supplements for the SOFTOUCH and SOFTOUCH TORIC (ocufilcon C) Soft (hydrophilic) Contact Lenses. In accordance
with the provisions of section 515(c)(2) of the act as amended by the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, this PMA was not
referred to the Ophthalmic Devices Panel, and FDA advisory panel, for review and recommendation because the information
in the PMA substantially duplicates information previously reviewed by this panel. On March 7, 1994, CDRH approved
the application by a letter to the applicant from the Acting Director of the Office of Device Evaluation, CDRH.


A summary of the safety and effectiveness data on which CDRH based its approval is on file in the Dockets Management
Branch (address above) and is available from that office upon written request. Requests should be identified with
the name of the device and the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.


Opportunity for Administrative Review


Section 515(d)(3) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(d)(3)) authorizes any interested person to petition, under section
515(g) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(g)), for administrative review of CDRH's decision to approve this application.
A petitioner may request either a formal hearing under part 12 (21 CFR part 12) of FDA's administrative practices and
procedures regulations or a review of the application and CDRH's action by an independent advisory committee of experts.
A petition is to be in the form of a petition for reconsideration under 10.33(b) (21 CFR 10.33(b)). A petitioner
shall identify the form of review requested (hearing or independent advisory committee) and shall submit with the
petition supporting data and information showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of material fact for
resolution through administrative review. After reviewing the petition, FDA will decide whether to grant or deny
the petition and will publish a notice of its decision in the 

Federal Register

. If FDA grants the petition, the notice will state the issue to be reviewed, the form of review to be used, the persons
who may participate in the review, the time and place where the review will occur, and other details.
Petitioners may, at any time on or before June 6, 1994, file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above) two
copies of each petition and supporting data and information, identified with the name of the device and the docket
number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received petitions may be seen in the office above between
9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
This notice is issued under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 515(d), 520(h) (21 U.S.C. 360e(d), 360j(h)))
and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Director,
Center for Devices and Radiological Health (21 CFR 5.53).
