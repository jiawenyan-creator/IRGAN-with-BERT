<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin by </F>
Robert Verdussen in Brussels; date not given: "Israel-PLO: 
Principal Problems Solved, but Time Still Needed"; first 
paragraph is LA LIBRE BELGIQUE introduction] 
  [Text] It seems that Shim'on Peres and Yasir 'Arafat will 
no doubt not be meeting on the evening of 7 February in Cairo in 
order to try, yet again, to open the door to an agreement on the 
implementation of Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. 
Failing a guarantee that, this time, he will be able to 
conclude with the Israeli foreign minister, the PLO leader will 
be absent. On the eve of this possible further meeting, Israeli 
Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin seemed to us both optimistic 
and prudent regarding the possibility of quickly concluding an 
agreement. 
<H5>  Such An Agreement Takes More Than a Couple of Pages </H5>
  [Verdussen] From the outside, it seems that Shim'on Peres 
and 
Yitzhaq Rabin are out of step. When the former meets 'Arafat, 
such as last time in Davos, he gives the impression that 
everything has been virtually settled. Then the prime minister 
comes across as much less optimistic and speaks of several weeks 
before everything is concluded. Is this a question of tactics 
or is there a problem within the government? 
  [Beilin] First of all, they are two different people and 
they 
may have different opinions. Having said this, most of the 
problems on the agenda were solved in Davos. Broadly speaking, 
there were three: the defense of the Israeli settlements in the 
Gaza strip, the extent of autonomy in Jericho, and control of 
the border with Jordan. These problems have so far prevented 
the signing of an agreement which, furthermore, was not on the 
agenda of Mr. Peres and Mr. 'Arafat, not in Oslo, Cairo or 
Davos. If, as I hope, the solution is found this week in Cairo, 
we will still need several weeks to conclude. Such an agreement 
takes more than a couple of pages. Mr. Peres and Mr. Rabin are 
not out of step, but there is a need to interpret and clarify. 
When Mr. Peres was optimistic, it was with respect to these 
three problems, not on the prospects of signing an agreement 
this Monday. 
<H5>  Respecting the Deadline? </H5>
  [Verdussen] Does this mean that the timetable set could have 
to be revised? 
  [Beilin] In Oslo, we decided that the whole process 
concerning Gaza and Jericho should take six months: two months 
for negotiations, four months for implementation. During the 
negotiations we realized that due to several details it would be 
impossible to conclude in two months. But we do not need four 
months to implement it. If the negotiations can be completed 
within the next few weeks, we can still respect the April 1994 
deadline. If not, it will be very difficult. 
  [Verdussen] What are the concrete problems which remain to 
be 
solved today for Palestinian autonomy? 
  [Beilin] Most of the problems are solved except regarding 
the 
transfer of authority in the fields of education, health, social 
assistance, etc. We are negotiating on all of this. Three or 
four questions remain to be settled or clarified. It is no 
longer always a question of negotiating but of exchanging 
information. It is a process. There are also economic problems 
which are not only important for us but also for Jordan and 
Egypt: currency, customs, population movements. 
<H5>  At the Highest Level </H5>
  [Verdussen] And to solve these problems do you need meetings 
at the highest level, between Mr. Peres and Mr. 'Arafat? 
  [Beilin] In theory, it is true, problems of this kind could 
be settled at a lower level. But the fact is that it is not 
possible at this level. 
  [Verdussen] Why? 
  [Beilin] Firstly, no doubt because there are no precedents 
for us. And then, it is a fact that there is less flexibility 
at this level than at the summit. 
  [Verdussen] Yitzhaq Rabin recently expressed regret before 
the European Parliament at the ambiguous position of the 12 
towards Israel. Can you explain this point of view? 
  [Beilin] If you ask me what I think of the attitude of the 
Europeans, I would say to you that the 12 should be more 
committed to the peace process. They are already committed, it 
is true, especially in the economic field. But that is not 
enough. The Europeans have always told us: We follow the 
Americans. And that can seem ambiguous. The Europeans must 
first help the Palestinians by being sure that the dollars they 
give get through to the population. And this is not easy to the 
extent that the Palestinians are still just beginning to set up 
their institutions. The Europeans must then become involved in 
joint development projects in the Middle East: electricity, 
water, roads, telecommunications. Security depends on politics 
but also on the economy. If certain countries such as Belgium 
are fully committed, other members of the European Union do not 
award the same priority to this problem. Money is important. 
But the Middle East also needs know-how and technology. And we 
must not forget that it is not just a question of charity but 
also an economic potential which could be very attractive.
