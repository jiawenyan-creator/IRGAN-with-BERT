FT  08 APR 94 / People: Natwest Markets
In a move aimed at bolstering its foreign exchange activities, Natwest
Markets has appointed Michael Cornford, 47, as head of global foreign
exchange.
He will fill the gap left by the promotion of Stephan Harris to the position
of group treasurer for the Natwest Bank group. Cornford leaves his position
as managing director, foreign exchange, at Swiss Bank Corporation in London
to take up his new post in May.
Cornford says his philosophy will be to 'deliver high value products and
services to a well focused client base'; clients require 'one-stop shopping'
delivered across time zones. But he adds that is 'coming to a first class
business where there is nothing broke that needs fixing'.
