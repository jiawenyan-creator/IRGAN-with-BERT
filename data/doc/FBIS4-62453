  [Text] During a two-day visit of Kazakh Prime Minister 
Sergey Tereshenko to Iran starting on 14 May, discussions will 
focus on cooperation in reprocessing and transportation of 
Kazakh oil through the Caspian Sea to the northern ports of Iran 
and the possibility of shipping an adequate amount of oil from 
its terminals in the Persian Gulf in return for Kazakh exports. 
This was said to INTERFAX by Kazakh Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vyacheslav Gizatov. 
  According to Gizatov, the discussions will also concern 
"specific plans of funding the construction of a plant for the 
production of machine oils in Atyrau, former Guryev, located on 
the northern coast of the Caspian Sea." 
  Gizatov noted that Iran is interested in imports of Kazakh 
grain, meat, coal and iron ore pellets. Kazakhstan in turn is 
willing to increase imports of consumer goods from Iran. 
  Tereshenko will discuss with the Iranian side the practical 
aspect of supplies to be carried out through the Caspian Sea. 
According to Gizzatov, it is expected that agreements be signed 
on coast trade, creation of a joint trade/commerce chamber, and 
easier procedures for mutual business trips.
