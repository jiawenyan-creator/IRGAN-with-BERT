  [Text] A representative of Russia's Foreign Ministry, 
Galina Sidrova, has stated that Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
didn't speak out for the continuing presence of Russian troops 
in the Baltic countries when addressing a meeting on foreign 
policy in Moscow on Monday [17 January]. Galina Sidrova 
stressed that the ITAR-TASS news agency has distorted the 
meaning of what the minister said. According to the ITAR-TASS 
news agency, Andrey Kozyrev objected to the withdrawal of 
Russia's troops from those regions. 
  America's Department of State has pointed out that what 
minister said, as was quoted by the news media, runs counter to 
the statements made at the Russian-American summit. A spokesman 
of the State Department, Michael McKerry, noted that the joint 
declaration of the Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin 
speaks about the speedy withdrawal of Russian troops from the 
Baltic countries.
