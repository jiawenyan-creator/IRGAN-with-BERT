ENTERTAINMENT; 
SAJAK IN DEBUT OUT-RATES 'TONIGHT' WITH GUEST HOST IN CARSON'S SPOT 
It remains to be seen whether CBS' Pat Sajak can beat NBC late-night king 
Johnny Carson, but the premiere of "The Pat Sajak Show" did out-rate "The 
Tonight Show" with comic Jay Leno as guest host Monday night. 
According to A. C. Nielsen Co. television ratings released today from the 17 
biggest television markets, Sajak's 90-minute talk show had a rating of 7.0 and 
a 25 share, to a 6.1 and 18 for the hourlong "Tonight." Sajak and Carson won't 
go head to head until Wednesday night. 
Sajak also was up against the first half of "Late Night With David Letterman" 
and ABC's half-hour news show "Nightline." Ratings for those shows were not 
immediately available.
