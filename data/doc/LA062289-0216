WORLD; 
MRS. UNO DISMISSES GEISHA STORY 
The wife of Japanese Prime Minister Sosuke Uno apologized for the clamor caused 
by reports her husband had paid a geisha $20,000 to have an affair with him, 
but said in an interview published today that she believed he was faithful. 
Chiyo Uno told the weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun she did not know the details 
about the alleged relationship between her husband and the unidentified geisha. 
"Of course, I believe that nothing of the sort happened," she said, adding that 
early in their marriage Uno had promised to be faithful. 
"At any rate, it's all in the past, so why should it be made an issue of now," 
Mrs. Uno said. "But I would not forgive him if he were to break his promise by 
fooling around with geishas." 
Japanese women's groups have expressed outrage over the scandal and have called 
on Uno to resign.
