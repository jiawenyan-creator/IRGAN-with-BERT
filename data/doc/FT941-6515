FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Iberdrola climbs 12% despite
weak peseta
Iberdrola, Spain's largest private-sector electricity generator, showed an
increase of almost 12 per cent in its 1993 pre-tax profit to Pta91.1bn
(Dollars 650m).
This was in spite of Pta34.9bn in foreign exchange losses caused by the
depreciation of the peseta last year.
Extraordinary gains of Pta12.1bn included the sale of shares in Fecsa, the
Catalan utility, and other assets to the state-controlled Endesa group as
part of a reorganisation for the Spanish electricity sector.
Turnover rose 2 per cent in the year to Pta767.6bn. The company's
hydroelectric output recovered 42 per cent from the previous year but was
still below average.
Nuclear energy accounted for 57 per cent of output.
Sonae Group, Portugal's biggest private-sector conglomerate, more than
doubled net profits to Es4.9bn (Dollars 28.2m) for 1993 on turnover ahead 9
per cent at Es228bn, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon.
Sonae Distribuicao, which takes in the Modelo supermarket chain and
Continente hypermarkets, achieved a 21 per cent rise in sales to Es202bn.
