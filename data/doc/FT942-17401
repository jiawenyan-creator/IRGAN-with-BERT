FT  05 APR 94 / Observer: Irish speculation
Meanwhile, the race is on, but no bets are being placed, for the replacement
of another independent-minded Irishman, Maurice Doyle, who steps down as the
governor of Ireland's central bank at the end of this month.
Traditionally, the job tends to go to a senior civil servant from the
Department of Finance. The obvious choice would be Sean Cromien, the first
secretary, but he turns 65 this year and the word is that he wishes to
dedicate his coming years to writing and wildlife pursuits. So the running
looks like being taken up by the three second secretaries: namely Maurice
O'Connell, 57, who heads the finance division; Paddy Mullarkey, 54, who
heads the budget and economic division; and Bob Curran who runs the public
expenditure division and is also in his 50s.
Outsiders include Kieran Kennedy, the director of Dublin's Economic and
Social Research Institute, Michael Somers of the National Treasury
Management Agency, and Gerry Scanlan, the recently retired chief executive
of Allied Irish Banks. The smart money is on O'Connell but Paddy Power's -
Ireland's largest bookmakers - is not taking bets. 'We think the decision
has already been made and insiders could catch us out', say the bookies.
