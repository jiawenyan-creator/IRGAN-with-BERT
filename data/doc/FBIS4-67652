  [Text] The health situation in Somalia is increasingly 
worrying. A cholera epidemic is gaining ground in the country. 
It has just reached the town of Kismayu in the south of 
Somalia, where the greatest part of the Belgian contingent used 
to be based. Dr. Georges Dalemagne, who is with the Medecins 
Sans Frontieres organization, takes stock of the situation:

  Dalemagne: There has been cholera in Somalia for a 
few weeks in several regions, including Baydhabo, Belet Huen, 
and Mogadishu. We heard last weekend through our team on the 
ground that there were cases in Kismayu. In a single weekend, 
we checked 127 people suffering from cholera into the hospital. 
A wind of panic is blowing through the town at the moment: it is 
rumored that there have been a few deaths, but the hospital has 
registered only one death so far among the 127 patients. 
  Correspondent Michel Lagaze: Do you think that 
things are going to get worse over the next few days, or could 
we have them under control? 
  Dalemagne: Cholera epidemics usually last for a 
few weeks. We have the impression that the peak is to be 
expected in less than a week's time, and there may well be 
several hundred cases in the town by then. We have had to take 
special measures. We have set up a special camp, a cholera 
camp, since the aim is twofold: to put the patients in 
quarantine and to give them special treatment -- they have to be 
hydrated, to be put under perfusion, to receive a specific 
antibiotic treatment. We have already sent 12,000 liters of 
perfusion fluid from our base in Nairobi. We may also need to 
close down some markets, to take measures to prevent this 
epidemic from spreading to other towns near Kismayu. [end
