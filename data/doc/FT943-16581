FT  04 JUL 94 / Business Travel (Update): Bucket shop hedge
The UK's Civil Aviation Authority has published proposals to protect
travellers who buy airline tickets in bucket shops, writes Michael
Skapinker. Its proposals will require shops selling discounted scheduled
flights to have their own Air Travel Organisers' Licences (Atol).
The Atol system protects passengers from losing their money or being
stranded abroad if their tour operator fails. Tour operators who sell
air-based trips are required by the CAA to lodge a bond - a financial
guarantee provided by a bank or insurance company.
