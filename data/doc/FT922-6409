FT  23 MAY 92 / Italian party chief quits
MR Arnaldo Forlani resigned last night as secretary-general of the Christian
Democrat party after repeated failures to impose his choice of a candidate
to be selected as Italy's next president on an increasingly divided party.
His surprise resignation followed the 14th attempt by the two houses of
parliament to elect a new president. He himself had offered to resign in the
wake of the April 5 general elections when the Christian Democrats saw their
share of the vote fall below 30 per cent for the first time since the war.
However, he withdrew his resignation at the request of the party leadership
and in the early rounds of the presidential election he was twice selected
to be the Christian Democrat party candidate. But he failed to gain the
required 508-vote majority.
The field is now open for a new series of alliances to gain majority support
for a presidential candidate.
The resignation emphasised that the mood of parliament favoured a candidate
who was clearly committed to carry out and symbolise the need for
fundamental institutional reforms.
