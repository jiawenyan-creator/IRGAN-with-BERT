  [Text] Raul Luks, the freshly appointed governor of 
Paldiski, a former Soviet nuclear training base in north-west 
Estonia, proved wrong rumours about a secret underwater(-land) 
submarine port in Paldiski. 
  Luks told ETA, on Thursday [17 February], that having 
investigated the whole territory of the Paldiski ports, he found 
no sign of such a base. Port specialists also assure that the 
existence of an underground port in Paldiski is "pure fantasy" 
and construction of such a base could, especially if the ground 
conditions of Paldiski were taken into consideration, have been 
impossible to hide. 
  Rumours of an underground building started when plans were 
made to build tunnels to bring cooling water for the nuclear 
reactors from the sea, which was not realized for the Baltic Sea 
was declared nuclear-free.
