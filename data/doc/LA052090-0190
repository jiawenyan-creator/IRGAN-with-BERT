BACKS FLEXIBLE ZONING 
I appreciated the remarks made by Sam Hall Kaplan in a recent column about West 
Hollywood's new courtyard housing regulations ("Welcome Mats Out for New 
Courtyards," May 6). 
We strongly believe that Los Angeles developers can provide better housing than 
they have been, and we will try to demonstrate that belief with our rules. 
In many ways, we view West Hollywood as an urban design laboratory for Greater 
Los Angeles. We do not believe that zoning regulations should be rigid and 
unalterable for decades, but rather should be viewed as fluid and reflective of 
new knowledge. 
We view every project that comes into the office as an experiment in that urban 
design laboratory, and the Planning Commission and City Council are committed 
to revising the rules as they learn from those laboratory experiments. 
This philosophy will drive developers crazy because we cannot offer them the 
complete predictability of some other cities. However, it is the only way that 
we can guarantee the residents (of all income levels) that we will work to 
provide better housing. 
On a more important note, although I appreciated Sam Kaplan quoting me, the 
majority of the courtyard work was done by Tim Gawronski, the city's brilliant 
urban designer. He deserves the real credit.
