268.204 

Pre-complaint processing.



(a) Aggrieved persons who believe they have been discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex,
national origin, age or disability must consult an EEO Counselor prior to filing a complaint in order to try to informally
resolve the matter.

(1) An aggrieved person must initiate contact with an EEO Counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged
to be discriminatory or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 days of the date that the action was communicated
to the aggrieved person.

(2) The Board shall extend the 45-day time limit in paragraph (a)(1) of this section when the individual shows that
he or she was not notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them, that he or she did not know and reasonably
should not have known that the discriminatory matter or personnel action occurred, that despite due diligence he
or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from contacting an EEO Counselor within the time limits,
or for other reasons considered sufficient by the Board.

(b) At the initial counseling session, EEO Counselors must advise individuals in writing of their rights and responsibilities,
including the right to request a hearing after the investigation by the Board, the right to file a notice of intent to
sue pursuant to 268.301(a) of this part and to file a lawsuit alleging a violation of the ADEA instead of an administrative
complaint of age discrimination under this part, the duty to mitigate damages, administrative and court time frames,
and that only the matter(s) raised in pre-complaint counseling (or issues like or related to issues raised in pre-complaint
counseling) may be alleged in a subsequent complaint filed with the Board. EEO Counselors must advise individuals
of their duty to keep the Board informed of their current address, to serve copies of requests for review by the Commission
on the Board, and to keep the Commission informed of their current address in connection with any review of a Board action.
The notice required by paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall include a notice of the right to file a class complaint.
If the aggrieved person informs an EEO Counselor that he or she wishes to file a class complaint, the EEO Counselor shall
explain the class complaint procedures and the responsibilities of the agent of the class.

(c) EEO Counselors shall conduct counseling activities in accordance with instructions promulgated by the EEO Programs
Director, which shall be consistent with the counseling guidelines contained in the Commission's ``EEO Management
Directives For 29 CFR part 1614''. When advised that a complaint has been filed by an aggrieved person, the EEO Counselor
shall submit a written report within 15 calendar days to the EEO Programs Director and to the aggrieved person concerning
the issues discussed and actions taken during counseling.
