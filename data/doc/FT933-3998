The proceeds will initially be used to reduce short-term borrowings, but the
company also intends to develop and invest in areas of its core business.
The group also announced a jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 553,000 to
Pounds 2.86m for the half year to June 30. Turnover edged ahead by Pounds
190,000 to Pounds 151.2m.

County NatWest is underwriting the cash call and brokers are Smith New
