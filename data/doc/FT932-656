FT  28 JUN 93 / Parties take aim at LDP: Five Japanese opposition groups
form electoral pact
THE leaders of five main non-communist opposition parties in Japan agreed
yesterday to maximise co-operation in the general election on July 18 with
the aim of defeating the Liberal Democratic party, which has been in power
since 1955.
The meeting of opposition parties, called by Mr Tsutomu Hata, leader of a
44-strong breakaway from the LDP, agreed to negotiate an electoral pact to
avoid their candidates splitting the anti-LDP vote.
The parties attending the meeting at a central Tokyo hotel were Mr Hata's
Shinseito, a conservative party formed last week, the Social Democratic
party, which is the largest opposition party, the Komeito clean government
party, the Democratic Socialist party and the small United Social Democratic
party.
The Japan New party, another new conservative party formed last year which
is becoming popular in urban areas, refused to attend because it said it did
not want to be associated with former members of the LDP.
The party leaders said they aimed to form a coalition government to reform
Japan's political system. However they shelved debate over controversial
foreign policy issues which divide them, such as their approach to Japan's
security alliance with the US.
Mr Hata's group of former LDP members includes strong supporters of US
policy and of Japan playing a larger role in United Nations peacekeeping
operations. But the Social Democratic party is opposed to both the
relationship with the US and the dispatch of Japanese troops abroad.
The opposition parties attempted to allay concerns about their differences
and the socialist influence within a coalition by saying they would maintain
the LDP's basic foreign and diplomatic policies.
The opposition meeting comes amid growing signs that Japanese business
leaders, including the Keidanren, the powerful federation of economic
organisations, will consider funding Mr Hata's party after the election.
