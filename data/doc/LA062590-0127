PERSISTENT COUGH IDLES GO FOR WAND 
A cough will keep Go For Wand, the champion 2-year-old filly of 1989, out of 
the 1 1/4-mile Coaching Club American Oaks July 8 at Belmont Park. 
"She had been coughing since last race, and I haven't been able to train her 
the way I would need to in order to get her to the race," trainer Bill Badgett 
said today. 
Plans are for Go For Wand to be readied for the Alabama Stakes at Saratoga Aug. 
11.
