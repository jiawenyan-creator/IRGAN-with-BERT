Stated interest at an objective rate. 

For purposes of 
paragraph (c) of this section, the imputed principal amount of a 
variable rate debt instrument (within the meaning of 
1.12755(a)) that provides for stated interest at a single 
objective rate is determined by assuming that the debt instrument 
provides for a fixed rate that reflects the yield that is 
reasonably expected for the instrument. This paragraph (f)(2) is 
effective for debt instruments issued on or after the date that 
is 60 days after final regulations are published in the 

Federal 
Register

. 



(g) 

Treatment of contingent payment debt instruments. 

For 
purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the stated principal 
amount of a debt instrument that provides for one or more 
contingent payments is the sum of the noncontingent principal 
payments and the projected amounts of any quotable contingent 
principal payments (as determined under 1.12754(b)(4)(i)). The 
imputed principal amount of the debt instrument is the sum of the 
present value of each noncontingent payment and the present value 
of the projected amount of each quotable contingent payment. For 
additional rules relating to a debt instrument that provides for 
one or more contingent payments, see 1.12754. This paragraph 
(g) is effective for debt instruments issued on or after the date 
that is 60 days after final regulations are published in the
