  [Text] Seoul, March 25 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry, in 
a bid to strengthen diplomacy on economic and trade issues, 
intends to take on seven officials who served at the Economic 
Planning Board (EPB), sources said Thursday. 
  The Ministry recently obtained one former EPB official of 
grade one when the board abolished the Office of External 
Economic Coordination. Six other grade-four and -five officials 
will join the ministry after taking a governmental-transfer 
test, they said. 
  "The first official accepted by the ministry has already 
been 
appointed to the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National 
Security," one source said. "The rest will be assigned to 
departments concerned with trade," he said.
