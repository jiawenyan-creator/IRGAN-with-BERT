FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Fall in asset sales behind decline at
Burtonwood
BURTONWOOD Brewery, the Cheshire-based real ale brewer, reported a 34 per
cent contraction in profits for the half year to September 26.
However, Mr John Dutton-Forshaw, chairman, was quick to point out that the
fall, from Pounds 3.05m to Pounds 2.02m, was entirely attributable to a
sharp reduction in asset disposals. Trading profits showed a 17 per cent
increase to Pounds 2.01m (Pounds 1.72m).
The 142 properties leased from Allied Breweries at the start of this year
contributed to a 14 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 25.7m with a similar
advance in volume. The group is still seeking to expand its estate either
through purchases or further leasing deals.
Reflecting the reduced contribution from asset sales, earnings per share
fell from 12.1p to 7.2p. If the sales were excluded, the earnings outcome
improved from 3.4p to 5p.
The interim dividend is maintained at 0.7p.
