  [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Vice President Ejup Ganic and 
Foreign Affairs Minister Irfan Ljubijankic have arrived in 
Ankara for talks. Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin received Ganic 
and Ljubijankic at Esenboga Airport. 
  In an airport statement, Cetin recalled that two years have 
passed since the first shots were fired in Sarajevo, adding that 
a historic tragedy has been taking place in the center of Europe 
ever since. Pointing out that the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
have been teaching the world a lesson on the issues of human 
rights and independence, Cetin said: 
  [Begin recording] From the very beginning, Turkey has stood 
by its Bosnian brothers and their just cause. It has supported 
their cause and tried to contribute to it. Turkey has always 
believed that it is a just cause and has been in the forefront 
both in the international arena and on a bilateral level. It 
has tried to make every possible contribution toward a just and 
lasting solution of the problem. [end recording] 
  Cetin concluded by saying that Turkey will continue to 
extend 
humanitarian aid and contribute to securing a lasting, just, and 
realistic peace. 
  Ganic said they came to Ankara to assess the recent 
developments in his country in the aftermath of the peace 
concluded with the Croats. He added that Turkey greatly 
contributed to their just cause through efforts exerted during 
the most critical days of the Bosnian people.
