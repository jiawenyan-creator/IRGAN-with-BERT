FT  24 MAY 93 / Third plan for HK airport funding
THE HONG KONG government has passed to China a third set of options for
financing the colony's HKDollars 165bn (Pounds 13.8bn) airport and related
infrastructure developments. Officials would give no details of the new
financial plan - the third in little more than a year - but said it was
given to Chinese government officials a few weeks ago.
The timing of the proposal appears to have coincided with senior Chinese
officials' remarks that they wanted to see the airport built according to
schedule.
Since the first financial plan was given to the Chinese in March last year,
the airport has been hostage to an agreed Sino-British solution to Hong
Kong's future political development.
News of the new plan comes amid signs of markedly better Anglo-Chinese
co-operation on economic aspects of Hong Kong's development which have
followed the resumption of bilateral talks about the colony's future
political arrangements.
Late last week China approved three business franchises which span June
1997, when it resumes sovereignty of Hong Kong. There are also indications
Beijing may re-enter discussions on development of the colony's container
port.
Tony Walker adds from Beijing: China and Britain agreed to resume talks on
the wider issue of Hong Kong's future later this week after their third
round of discussions in Beijing ended yesterday without apparent
breakthrough.
A joint statement said merely that a fourth round would be held on May 28-29
in Beijing. But Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador to Beijing and head
of his country's negotiating team, described the atmosphere of the latest
round as good. 'The work we're doing is quite complicated,' he said. His
remarks indicated the two sides may have moved on to more substantial
discussions.
