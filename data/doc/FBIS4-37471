  [Text] Nabil Sha'th will not come to East Jerusalem today. 
Qol Yisra'el's reporter, quoting authoritative sources, says he 
will not come because his current work load prevents him from 
doing so. Senior Israeli officials were informed of the PLO 
official's decision. 
  Last night, Sha'th met with several members of the 
Palestinian Authority. A Qol Yisra'el reporter says they 
discussed Sha'th's talks with Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq 
on early empowerment and preparations for the upcoming visit of 
Yasir 'Arafat. General Shahaq and Nabil Sha'th are to resume 
negotiations next Monday. 
  Speaking to reporters in Jericho last night, Sha'th outlined 
the main items on the agenda: 
  [Begin Sha'th recording] First item on the negotiations will 
be the continued release of the prisoners and those prisoners 
who are here in Jericho, and the second item, of course, will be 
the immediate negotiations on early empowerment of the full 
spread of the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian police in 
the West Bank, and then, of course, also continuing to finish 
the unfinished matters from the Gaza and Jericho. [end

  Sha'th also explained why he had come to Jericho at this 
stage: 
  [Begin Sha'th recording] I want to make sure that Jericho 
has all the help and support and protection that Gaza now has 
from its Palestinian police and Palestinian Authority, but also 
I am very happy to be here. I have not been here since 1948.
