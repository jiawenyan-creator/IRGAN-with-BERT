More than 350 people were arrested in abortion protests in five states. At 
least six protesters at an abortion clinic in Woodbridge, N.J., had chains 
wound around their necks and chained themselves together neck-to-leg. They 
later were dragged out of the building by a squad of police from New York City 
who brought special equipment, including an electric grinder, to break the 
shackles. At least 17 other protesters were arrested, police said. At Cranston, 
R.I., about 60 protesters blocked the doors of an abortion clinic before police 
carried them away. Thirty-two demonstrators in Bristol, Tenn., were arrested on 
trespassing charges outside an abortion clinic and about 150 were arrested at a 
St. Petersburg, Fla., clinic. In Stanton, Del., 65 anti-abortionists were 
arrested. About 100 abortion supporters held a counterdemonstration.
