FT  18 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: Beregovoy fails to stem weakness in French
issues
FRENCH government bonds fell yesterday as speculation over the French
currency persisted in spite of firm statements by the French prime minister
and finance minister that the franc would remain within the European
exchange rate mechanism and would not be devalued.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, and Mr Michel Sapin, the finance
minister, held press conferences yesterday at which they stressed their
commitment to defending the franc/D-Mark parity. They said that the economic
fundamentals did not justify a lower exchange rate for the franc.
However, short-term money market rates continued to rise, and three-month
money was quoted at 11 1/4 per cent to 12 per cent against 11 per cent to 11
1/2 per cent on Wednesday. The franc held steady at 3.4178 to 3.4182 to the
D-Mark.
The March bond future settled at 110.70, down 0.40, while in the cash market
the yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2003 ended at 8.35 per cent,
compared with 8.28 per cent at the opening. Sentiment was not helped by the
auction of two- and five-year notes.
THE CONTINUED tensions within the ERM helped to lift German government bond
prices, although dealers noted that trading volume was thin.
The market paid little heed to the Bundesbank's monthly report yesterday in
which the central bank said that Germany's economic outlook had worsened
significantly but that monetary policies would remain tight because of
concern about inflation.
The Bundesbank also announced that the bond consortium of banks would meet
on December 29 to decide the terms of the new federal bond issue. The March
bund futures contract on Liffe ended at around 91.63, up from 91.57 at
Wednesday's close.
US TREASURY prices were flat-to-lower across the maturity range yesterday
after investors had mostly ignored the latest economic news.
The benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 102 3/8 , yielding
7.420 per cent. The two-year note was slightly weaker, down 1/32 at 99 15/16
, yielding 4.641 per cent.
Trading was listless, with no particular bias, although the early pressure
on prices was primarily downwards. News that initial claims for jobless
insurance rose 22,000 in the week ended December 5, that the October trade
gap narrowed to Dollars 7.03bn, and that the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's
index of local business activity doubled in November failed to have much of
an impact on market sentiment.
Some dealers attributed the lacklustre nature of trading to an unwillingness
of investors to play the market ahead of next weeks' auctions of new two-
and five-year notes.
UK GOVERNMENT bonds ended firmer, gaining about  1/8 of a point at the long
end following the release of worse-than-expected unemployment figures. The
gilt market opened on a weak note, but news that unemployment rose by 41,100
in November lifted prices. The unemployment figures were higher than
expected, and raised hopes that there might be a cut in interest rates soon.
However, dealers pointed out that any rise in the market is likely to be
limited by the overhang of new stock.
The Liffe gilt future contract rose from 99.24 to 99.31.
