BM Group is continuing its restructuring with the sale for ADollars 13.5m

Blackwood Hodge (Australia). The remaining 3 per cent is held by another
Japanese manufacturer, Tadano, for whom BH (Australia) acts as a distributor
in Australia.
In the year to June 30 1993, BH (Australia) incurred losses of ADollars 1.7m
(ADollars 1.89m profits).
