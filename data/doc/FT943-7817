FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Credit warning
People holding credit cards could lose out under the reforms of consumer
credit proposed by the Office of Fair Trading, the Consumers' Association
warned in a report published this week. It attacked the new limits
recommended by the OFT within which card issuers should be liable for goods
or services misrepresented or not delivered.
The removal of credit providers' 'joint and several liability' was
recommended by the deregulation task force set up by the Department of Trade
and Industry. In June, the OFT concluded that the protection should remain,
but within slightly narrower limits. It said the minimum transaction for
which it applied should be raised from Pounds 100 to Pounds 150, while the
upper limit should be set at Pounds 25,000 rather than Pounds 30,000.
Jean Eaglesham, of the CA, said it was 'iniquitous to raise the lower limit
while lowering the upper', particularly as the average credit card purchase
was just Pounds 40. But the OFT said the rise in the lower limit, the first
since 1985, would be in line with keeping the liability to relatively
high-priced goods and services. It did not believe significant transactions
now protected in law would be excluded by the fall in the maximum.
