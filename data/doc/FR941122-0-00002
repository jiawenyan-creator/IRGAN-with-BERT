<CFRNO>7 CFR Chapter II and Parts 271 and 278 </CFRNO>



Food Stamp Program: Revision of the Definition of Insured Financial Institutions and Modification of Food Stamp
Redemption Procedures




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Consumer Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule amends Food Stamp Program regulations relative to food stamp redemption and changes the definition of ``insured
financial institution''. This change is necessary because of statutory revisions to the Federal bank insurance
system. Financial institutions formerly insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC)
are now insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF), which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC). This rule also modifies the procedures for financial institutions which deposit food stamps
at Federal Reserve Banks in order to be consistent with changes in Federal Reserve requirements. 



In addition, this rule amends 7 CFR chapter II to reflect the abolishment of the Food and Nutrition Service and the establishment
of the Food and Consumer Service in the recent Department of Agriculture reorganization. 



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 The amendments to parts 271 and 278 are effective December 22, 1994. The amendments to the heading of 7 CFR Chapter II
and to the references in the chapter are effective November 22, 1994.

Executive Order 12866 



This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and therefore, has not been
reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 



Executive Order 12372 



The Food Stamp Program is listed in the 

Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance 

under No. 10.551. For the reasons set forth in the final rule and related Notice(s) to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V (48 FR
29115, June 24, 1983 or 48 FR 54317, December 1, 1983, as appropriate, and any subsequent notices that may apply), this
program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with
State and local officials. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This action has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96354).
The Administrator of the Food and Consumer Service has certified that this action does not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule makes only slight technical changes to the Food Stamp Program
coupon redemption procedures to improve system accountability, while also revising the definition of ``insured
financial institution''.
