FT  12 AUG 93 / Jobless total set to slide further
THE GOVERNMENT is today expected to announce the sixth consecutive monthly
fall in unemployment, with City analysts predicting a fall of about 5,000,
David Goodhart writes. This would take the decline since February close to
90,000, with total unemployment at just over 2.9m.
Government economists are increasingly optimistic that the economy is now
generating a net increase in employment. In the first quarter of this year,
which included two months of falling unemployment, the number of people in
employment fell by 61,000.
Unemployment was therefore falling in the first quarter of the year not
because of a net increase in job creation but because fewer people were
coming on to the job market, as a result of factors such as more people
staying on in full-time education. More recent figures for manufacturing
employment show that it fell by 15,000 between April and May.
The second-quarter employment figure for the whole economy will not be known
until next month, but one government economist said yesterday it would be
'disappointing' if it did not show a reasonable increase in view of
stronger-than-expected output.
