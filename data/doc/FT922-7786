FT  16 MAY 92 / Letter: Markets do make mistakes
Sir, Stuffing Canary Wharf full of Michael Heseltine's civil servants is a
cosmetic exercise, borne out of desperation, and at taxpayers' expense.
Throughout the 1980s, the cranky ideas of the New Right were given full rein
in Britain and the US with disastrous social and economic consequences. For
examples of this you need look no further than the riots of Los Angeles, or
the sheer depth of the British recession.
The New Right has enjoyed unrestrained political power in the US and Britain
for 12-13 years. There is no-one its adherents can blame this time.
Ironically, the real 'culprit' is their blind faith in the 'free market'
which has been elevated to almost mystical status.
Simply put, markets, like people, can and do make mistakes. This could not
be otherwise given that markets are nothing more or less than the collective
results of the myriad decisions and actions by, yes, people. Thus markets
are far from being infallible.
Hence the zealots of the right haven't discovered the philosopher's stone
but merely a rich seam of political prejudice.
There are three lessons to be learned from the 1980s: markets don't always
get it right; government does have a role to play; creating a huge
underclass harms society at all levels.
Canary Wharf, the biggest office development in the world, is merely one of
the more visible mistakes of the markets in the 1980s. It should be re-named
Turkey Tower.
