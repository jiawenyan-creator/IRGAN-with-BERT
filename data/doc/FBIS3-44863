  [Text] At a national work conference on politics and law 
which ended today [25 December], Luo Gan, state councillor and 
deputy secretary of the Central Commission on Politics and Law, 
said: It is necessary to conduct in-depth survey and study, 
keep abreast of the developing situation, and improve and reform 
the work on politics and law. He said: Comparatively more 
reform measures will be adopted next year. If our work on 
politics and law lags behind schedule, serious consequences will 
arise. Therefore, we must earnestly understand the guidelines 
of the instructions given by the central authorities on 
improving and reforming the work on politics and law; conduct 
in-depth survey and study by integrating them with the operation 
of each department; make further suggestions on each 
department's work and draw up plans for reform; organize their 
implementation under proper guidance and in a planned way; and 
strive to make the work of each political and legal department 
meet the needs of developing a socialist market economy. Luo 
Gan said the national work conference on politics and law, which 
ended today, was a great success. He required that close 
attention be paid to relaying the guidelines of the conference 
and to preventing bureaucracy and formalism in a bid to produce 
results from the work on politics and law at an early date.
