 

The 1993 coastwide commercial quota apportioned to North Carolina effective on January 1, 1993 (58 FR 5658; January
22, 1993), in the amount of 3,435,214 pounds (1.56 million kg) was revised by Amendment 4 to the FMP effective October
25, 1993 (58 FR 49937), reducing the amount by 45,649 pounds (20,706 kg) totalling 3,389,565 pounds (1.54 million
kg). North Carolina made three transfers during 1993 totalling 257,815 pounds (116,942 kg) of summer flounder, reducing
the amount to 3,131,750 pounds (1.42 million kg). Two transfers were made to Virginia for 125,000 pounds (56,699 kg)
each; one was effective on November 3, 1993 (58 FR 59196; November 8, 1993), and the other was effective on November
19, 1993 (58 FR 62050). The third transfer was made to New Jersey in the amount of 7,815 pounds (3,545 kg) and was effective
on November 18, 1993 (58 FR 61844; November 23, 1993).
Further, the Regional Director is required to publish a notification in the 

Federal Register 

advising a state, and notifying Federal vessel and dealer permit holders that, effective upon a specific date, a portion
of a state's commercial quota has been transferred to, or combined with, the commercial quota of another state.
North Carolina and Rhode Island have agreed to transfer 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) of North Carolina's commercial quota
to Rhode Island. The Regional Director has determined that the criteria set forth in 625.20 have been met, and
publishes this notification of quota transfer. The revised quotas for the calendar year 1993 are: North Carolina_3,121,750
pounds (1,416,016 kg); Rhode Island_1,946,851 pounds (883,086 kg).
As a result of this quota transfer, the previous notice of closure effective December 22, 1993, is rescinded and vessels
may again land summer flounder in Rhode Island until the available 1993 quota is harvested.
