  [Text] The publication of the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya 
has been suspended from March 31. INTERFAX was told by a 
spokesperson for the newspaper's editorial board that the Pressa 
Publishing House refuses to accept orders from the newspaper 
which is dubbed "Sovraska" referring to its debt to the printing 
shop. The paper sought subsidies at the Russian Committee for 
the Press to no avail. The newspaper's management does not know 
when the paper is likely to be printed again. 
  In March the newspaper's circulation totaled 450,000 copies 
while only 255,000 subscribers received it. In April it was 
planned to increase the circulation up to 500,000 and 270,000 
copies correspondingly. 
  Following the tragic events on October 3-4, 1993, the 
Russian 
Ministry for Press and Information suspended the newspaper's 
publication. The Russian Court of Arbitration said the decision 
was illegal. The damage sustained by the editorial board was 
over 1,300 Mn rubles. The paper says it did not receive 
compensation so far. 
  The Communist and Agrarian factions of the State Duma 
appealed to the subscribers and the supporters to grant the 
newspaper relief aid "to prevent the people's voice from being 
muffled."
