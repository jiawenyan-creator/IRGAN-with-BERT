 


As shown in the bottom panel of Exhibit B.4, substantially smaller effects will be 
detectable if the lease-up rate in the MTO group turns out to be 40 percent. In particular, 
differences in impact between the regular Section 8 group and the MTO group of 15 to 22 
percent will be detectable if the lease-up rate is 40 percent. 



Minimum detectable effects for site-specific estimates will be about 2.24 times as large 
as those for the pooled five-site estimates. Therefore, only very large program impacts will be 
detectable within individual sites. 



The minimum detectable effects on employment rates estimated here for the pooled five-site sample (even for the more
conservative lease-up rate assumption) are of the same order of 
magnitude as the effects found by Rosenbaum and Fischer in their studies of mobility programs 
for public housing tenants and applicants, and the minimum detectable effects on educational 
attainment are similar to the effect Rosenbaum found for school dropout rates.

 This suggests 
that the demonstration sample will be adequate to detect effects of the size that are likely to 
occur. However, it must be borne in mind that those earlier studies may have been subject to 
selection bias that would inflate their estimates of program impact.

The minimum detectable effects shown here are based on HUD's initial commitment of 
certificates and vouchers to the MTO experimental design, totalling 1,800. A further allocation 
of about 1,500 certificates and vouchers is available in FY94.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 The proportion of these 
resources that will be devoted to the experimental evaluation of MTO has not yet been 
determined; some may be reserved for demonstrations of different MTO administrative models. 
However, Exhibit B.5 shows the minimum detectable effects that would be attainable if this 
entire allocation were used to increase the sample size for the experimental evaluation of MTO 
to 3,300 certificates and vouchers.

The precise number of certificates and vouchers that can be supported with a given budget cannot be determined until
sites are known, since the cost of certificate or voucher depends on the fair market rent in the local area.

Allocating additional certificates and vouchers to the experimental evaluation would almost certainly require
either the selection of new sites or expansion of the target areas of the five existing sites, in order to obtain a sufficient
number of eligible families to use the certificates and vouchers.
