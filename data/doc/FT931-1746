FT  24 MAR 93 / Management: Time is still right to be flexible
The recession has put paid to much of the talk by employers of having to
evolve 'family friendly' policies in order to attract and retain staff. In
particular, the need to woo women back into the workforce is not the red-hot
issue it once was.
Nevertheless, a strong business case can still be made for employers to
examine the economics of providing subsidised childcare and allowing
flexible working hours, according to a report* published last week by
Opportunity 2000 and the Institute of Personnel Management.
For example, the potential cost of having to replace a junior manager
earning Pounds 15,000 a year totals Pounds 6,688, found the study. At the
same time, an annual employer subsidy for a workplace nursery for 40
children costs Pounds 62,359, or just over Pounds 1,500 per child.
The cost of sick leave and absenteeism for other reasons also has to be
costed out and balanced against the price of administering job-sharing and
flexible hours schemes, says the report.
Case studies show the gains to be made from providing benefits in practice.
Debenhams, the high street retailer, piloted Childcare Vouchers - which can
be swapped by the employee for childcare of their choice - at its store in
the Lakeside shopping centre in Essex. The store reported a 50 per cent rise
in the retention of employees working peak trading hours after the initial
year, compared with similar retailers in the shopping centre.
