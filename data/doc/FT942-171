FT  30 JUN 94 / 'Ghost town' fear for city shoppers
The centres of 10 towns could become 'ghost towns' over the next decade
unless action is taken to curb development of out-of-town shopping centres,
the Commons environment committee was told yesterday.
Mr Martin Chase, director of the Association of Town Centre Management, told
the committee - investigating shopping centres - that the problem was most
acute in larger towns and cities whose centres were given over largely to
retail activity. If more attractive shopping centres appeared nearby, these
could draw away substantial numbers of shoppers.
Gateshead, in north-east England; Dudley in the West Midlands, and towns
near the Lakeside centre in Essex were cited as examples of centres which
had already been severely affected by out-of-town developments.
Mr Chase said: 'One retailer estimates that 95 per cent of the business that
has been generated in Lakeside has come from business lost in other stores
within the Lakeside catchment.' He added that 'on present trends, 10 town
centres would become ghost towns in the next 10 years'.
Mr Chase said smaller market towns could also be 'devastated' by out-of-town
superstores, unless these were positioned to reinforce retailing activity in
the town centre rather than compete with it. He welcomed the government's
new planning guidelines emphasising the need to protect town centres, and
said it was vital they were put into practice.
The Royal Town Planning Institute told the committee that 'in seeking
sustainable forms of retail development, its distribution cannot be left to
the operation of market forces'.
