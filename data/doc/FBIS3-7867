  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech 
Republic was shaken by the report on the horrific massacre of 
Palestinian Muslims in Hebron in Israel, says the statement 
released today by Vit Kurfirst, the ministry's press spokesman . 
  The ministry emphasizes that it is up to all those who 
participate in the conflict and up to the whole international 
community to prevent this tragic development from leading to 
further escalation of tension and from becoming an 
insurmountable obstacle to the promising developments in the 
peace talks so far. The statement voices a hope that all of the 
involved sides will exercise full responsibility for the lives 
of other people and will begin speedy and effective talks aimed 
at a just, lasting, and comprehensive peaceful solution.
