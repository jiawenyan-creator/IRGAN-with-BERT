FT  05 MAY 92 / Letter: L'Ouest is Ouest
Sir, James Morgan, who prides himself on being an expert on the European
press ('Perspectives: British papers  - the best and the worst/The press in
Europe', April 25) seems at pains to explain why 'the biggest French daily,
L'Ouest Republicain, sells only about 1m', is unknown to foreigners, and
that this astonishing newspaper 'seems to be published in Rennes'.
Here is the key to Mr Morgan's worries  - L'Ouest Republicain was indeed
founded in Rennes at the Liberation in 1947. But it no longer appears.
Besides, Ouest-France surely is France's best selling daily. It is published
in Rennes and sells about 1m copies. But it has 38 editions and not just a
mere dozen. And the Bretons don't seem to mind its publication in Rennes,
since it is a regional paper.
Now, my turn to be dismayed. When Mr Morgan surveys the the European press,
how can he write at length about France-Soir, which hardly anyone reads any
more (although 30 years ago it was France's largest selling paper) and is
shortly about to cease publication once and for all, and conveniently forget
to mention le Monde.
As a daily FT reader, I would agree that you find the best and the worst in
British papers. The FT generally complies with the first part of the remark;
Mr Morgan's article fits the latter one.
