  [Text] Washington, Feb. 28 KYODO -- U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor indicated Monday [28 February] the 
U.S. Government is firming up its Japan trade policy after 
reviewing policy options and recommendations over the past two 
weeks. "We have made a number of decisions," Kantor said. 
  He would not disclose what action, if any, the United States 
might take but U.S. officials have said one policy option is to 
resurrect the so-called "Super 301" provision, which would allow 
Washington to retaliate against countries deemed to be engaging 
in unfair trade practices. 
  President Bill Clinton and other senior U.S. officials have 
repeatedly said the U.S. is reviewing actions on Japan following 
the collapse of trade talks between the two countries February 
11. 
  Kantor told reporters after making a speech on trade policy 
that the Clinton administration has reached a number of 
decisions on Japan but the process of policy review has yet to 
be completed. 
  "We still have a number of other options and we continue to 
make decisions as we proceed," he said. 
  Kantor would give little information when pressed by 
reporters about the options and policy recommendations under 
consideration. 
  Asked whether the emerging U.S. trade policy on Japan will 
include revival of Super 301, he replied, "we will announce it 
when we are ready."
