FT  18 MAY 92 / Pakistan plans environment initiative ahead of summit
THE Pakistani government is about to launch its national conservation
strategy as preparations continue for a high-level delegation, led by Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, to attend next month's Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro.
The conservation plan, which coincides with increasing concern among foreign
aid donors over environmental damage in Pakistan, involves projects in 14
areas.
'In a country where the environment has been severely damaged because of
deforestation, pollution and a large population, we have to tackle our
problems,' a senior government official said.
Mr Anwar Saifullah Khan, the environment minister, said at the weekend that
the environmental plan would need Rs150bn (Pounds 3.35bn) over the next 10
years.
The government expects to provide up to Rs90bn from its own budget while
hoping to raise the remainder through foreign assistance and projects
involving the private sector.
'We will come up with new laws which will take care of all aspects of the
environment within the next six months to a year,' the minister said.
Such laws might tighten regulations on industrial pollution and waste
disposal, officials added.
Despite the plans, western development experts believe that Pakistan
continues to be bogged down with a population of 112m, growing at more than
3 per cent a year. There are also fears that corruption in the forestry
sector may limit moves to curb deforestation.
