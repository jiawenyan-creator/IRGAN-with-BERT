FT  02 DEC 94 / Clinton's man seeks dividend: A look at the fresh faces in
Northern Ireland's peace process
President Bill Clinton yesterday named the retiring senator Mr George
Mitchell as his special adviser for economic initiatives in Northern
Ireland.
'There must be a peace dividend in Ireland for peace to succeed,' Mr Clinton
said in a White House ceremony to announce the appointment.
Although the appointment marks to some degree a larger US role in the search
for peace in Northern Ireland, US officials insisted that they were not
directly involved in the peace process and were concentrating only on the
economic aspects. Mr Clinton's election campaign promise to appoint a peace
envoy caused considerable friction with the British government before it was
shelved.
Mr Mitchell, who did not run for re-election in last month's congressional
elections, will step down as leader of the Senate Democratic majority when
the new Congress is installed in January. His appointment will take effect
on January 10.
Although Mr Mitchell's father was the son of Irish immigrants, his more
publicised root has generally been his mother's Lebanese origins.
A former judge with a keen legal mind, studiously even-tempered manner and
unrelenting tenacity, Mr Mitchell has been wooed for a wide range of far
more prominent jobs. Mr Clinton tried to persuade him to accept a seat on
the Supreme Court earlier this year but Mr Mitchell preferred to press for
health care reform before he stepped down from the Senate. He remains a
popular choice to become commissioner of baseball.
