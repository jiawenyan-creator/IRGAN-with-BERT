FT  28 MAY 92 / Nato hopefulon defence roles deal
MR Manfred Worner, secretary-general of Nato, expressed optimism yesterday
that the alliance would resolve its row over the role of the new European
corps being set up by France and Germany.
His statement at the end of a two-day meeting of Nato defence ministers  -
not including France - came amid increasing signs of reluctance by other
European allies to commit themselves to joining the corps, as Bonn and Paris
have invited them to do.
'I have no doubt that in the end we will find sat-isfying solutions, not
only for France and the US but for all of the allies,' Mr Worner said.
Much would depend on the detailed arrangements for the new 35,000-man corps,
he added.
Several allies including the UK and the Netherlands, have voiced concern
that the Franco-German plan could undermine the transatlantic alliance.
Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, said Washington still had some
'unanswered questions about the new corps'. Foremost among these was how it
would fit in with the role allotted to the Western European Union as the
vehicle for developing Europe's defence interests.
Belgium is seen as one of the most likely candidates for an expansion of the
Franco-German initiative.
But Mr Leo Delacroix, its defence minister, said it would join only if the
corps were placed clearly under the political authority of the WEU.
The military units which Belgium is considering assigning to the corps would
be the same as it is earmarking for Nato's new rapid reaction forces.
Spain, which like France stands outside Nato's integrated military command,
remains interested in the Franco-German initiative, while Italy said it did
not intend to join the corps but would make other units available to the
WEU.
