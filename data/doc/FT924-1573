FT  17 DEC 92 / Observer: Up-beat
Music-lovers of the world, take heart - the fight back has begun. A court in
Hong Kong has just suspended nine-month jail sentences passed on two
club-goers who responded to a karaoke singer by beating him up.
Although the song being murdered by businessman Lau Kin-chung was not My
Way, but a Cantonese number called Just Once, it proved too much for
defendants Chu Wai-kit and Lo Hoi-sze. They claimed the assault was provoked
by 'intolerable singing'.
Moreover, their lawyers said they were not the only assailants: just the
ones who'd been too drunk to get away before the police arrived.
