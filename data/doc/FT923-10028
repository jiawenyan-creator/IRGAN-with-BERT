FT  01 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Abbey National profits fear - The Week
ahead
THE two largest UK banks, Barclays and National Westminster, announce their
half year results this week, together with Abbey National and Standard
Chartered.
Abbey National's profits on Monday may well disappoint the market, at least
by comparison with the sparkling performances it has given in previous
years. High bad debts will probably push last year's Pounds 308m pre-tax
profits down to around Pounds 270m.
National Westminster on Tuesday is likely to report profits not far from
last year's poor performance of Pounds 101m.
Standard Chartered turned in Pounds 83m at the interim stage a year ago.
Forecasts for its latest result on Wednesday range from around Pounds 60m to
slightly above last year's figure.
Barclay's results on Thursday will attract the most attention. Heavy
provisions are likely to drive its half year figures well below its Pounds
378m pre-tax profit at the half-way stage last year. SG Warburg forecast
profits of only Pounds 120m - a very disappointing figure for the UK's
largest bank.
A dividend cut of up to 50 per cent is widely expected when British
Petroleum reports second quarter figures on Thursday. The June firing of
Robert Horton, chairman and arch-defender of an unchanged dividend, cleared
the way for a more realistic payout. Income on an historic cost basis is
likely to have slumped to about Pounds 100m from Pounds 243m.
Royal Dutch Shell has fared much better and will turn in net income of about
Pounds 520m against Pounds 532m on the same day.
Unilever will report on Friday second quarter pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 490m (Pounds 448m). It will have benfitted from a cut of about Pounds
20m in interest costs thanks to debt reduction and from a pick up from the
tough year-earlier quarter. Sales of some products such as perfumes were
depressed then by lower tourism in the wake of the Gulf War.
