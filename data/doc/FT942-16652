FT  08 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
A slow day in the derivatives markets picked up towards the close when
London turned nervous as Wall Street started the new session on the downward
tack, writes Terry Byland. The June contract on the Footsie had an erratic
day, opening at a modest discount to fair value, which is now estimated at
between 3 and seven points.
Early deals saw the June contract fall away fairly sharply to a low for the
session of 3,106 as investors backed away from the latest data on the
domestic economy. But buyers then appeared and at 3,154, the contract
provided a good lead for equities, showing a premium of around 12 points to
cash. later, when Wall Street unsettled UK markets, the contract faded to a
close of 3,137, still an 8 point premium. trading volume, taking in business
after the official close, reached just over 14,000 contracts.
Business in traded options jumped to 42,227 contracts from 29,165 on the
previous day. The FT-SE contract took pride of place with 18,242 contracts
against 14,071. The Euro FT-SE contract was also active, trading 6,269
contracts. Individual contracts were headed by Hanson at 1,987 and other
blue chips to attract interest included BAT Industries (1,932).
