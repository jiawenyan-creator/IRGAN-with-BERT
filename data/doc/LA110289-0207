JERRY BUSS' DAUGHTER ROBBED OF $25,000 IN JEWELRY AT THE FORUM 
A gunman confronted the daughter of Jerry Buss inside her father's Great 
Western Forum sports arena and robbed her of $25,000 in jewels, police said 
today. 
Jeanie Buss, 28, director of tennis and volleyball for her father's California 
Sports Inc., was in the north stairwell on her way to her Inglewood Forum 
office when the gunman approached Wednesday morning. 
"She was shaken up. This is the first such burglary that has occurred on our 
premises," said Bob Steiner, spokesman for the Forum. 
The items stolen included a Los Angeles Laker's championship ring, a Rolex 
watch, a diamond tennis bracelet and her engagement ring. 
According to Forum officials, the suspect was 18 to 20 years old, about 5 feet 
10 inches and was wearing green pants and a white T-shirt. 
The robbery appeared to have been planned, Steiner said, because at the time a 
guard was between posts while walking his rounds. There were no sports events 
going on in the Forum, which hosts Lakers basketball and Los Angeles Kings 
hockey games.
