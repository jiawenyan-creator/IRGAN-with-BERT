  [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- China is training more 
personnel in property appraisal to help the nation carry out 
reforms in state-owned enterprises and establish Sino-foreign 
joint ventures. 
  In the past few years, hundreds of seminars were held with 
instruction from overseas experts, including ones from the 
United States, Australia and Hong Kong. 
  Liu Lunan, deputy director of the Property Appraisal Center 
of the State Administration of State-Owned Property, said that 
these seminars and exchanges with noted foreign counterparts 
have effectively improved the Chinese appraisal level. 
  More than 1,600 property appraisal institutions have been 
founded in China, hiring over 26,700 professionals. About half 
of them have acquired middle or senior professional 
qualifications. 
  Liu said that these institutions have greatly reduced the 
property loss during the transfer of state-owned property and 
given help to reforms carried out in large state-owned 
enterprises. 
  Property appraisal, a new sector which only started six 
years 
ago in China, has been expanding rapidly, Liu said. 
  Most of the professionals have gradually acquired the theory 
and method of appraisal through practice in the past few years. 
Their work in a number of enterprises whose shares were listed 
abroad won praises from their overseas counterparts.
