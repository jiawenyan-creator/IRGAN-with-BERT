FT  28 NOV 92 / Markets: Tokyo stock market rises - At a Glance
Sentiment that the Japanese government will embark on a programme of fiscal
expansion next year has helped push the Tokyo stock market into its most
prolonged run of price rises since February last year. This was not
difficult, as the index fell steeply during the first few months of 1992.
Sentiment persists among foreign investors that the market is over-valued.
The Nikkei index hit a low for the year of 14,309 in August, and on Friday
stood at 17,470.61. However, this is still below the year's high (in
September) of 18,908.
