FT  14 JAN 93 / Attack on Iraq: Opposition supports strike
THE OPPOSITION Iraqi National Congress (INC), made up of liberal Arabs and
Kurds, last night expressed support for allied military action against Iraq,
writes Gareth Smyth in London.
'Any military strike that weakens Saddam Hussein will be welcomed by the
Iraqi people,' said spokesman Ahmed Chalabi. 'The noose must be tightened
around him.'
An INC statement issued in London called for the creation of a UN-guaranteed
security zone in south Iraq; for the immediate convocation of a tribunal to
try Mr Saddam for crimes against humanity; and for the United Nations to
take over direct responsibility for all humanitarian assistance from Mr
Saddam's regime.
