 

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


In 1990 the U.K. Companies Act was amended to permit issuers listed on the London Stock Exchange to provide holders
of their ordinary shares with an option to receive either a full annual report or a summary annual report. The U.K. Companies
Act sets forth the specific financial and management information that must be contained in the summary reports, and
requires that shareholders who receive only the summary report be given the opportunity, at any time, to obtain the
full annual report from the company and that companies must notify shareholders annually of this right and how the
report might be obtained. When the amendments first became effective, shareholders received both reports and notice
of the available option with respect to future reports.
The purpose of the amendments was to provide: (1) Potential cost savings to issuers, and (2) a more easily read document
to retail holders. A majority of U.K. shareholders now receive the summary reports, and the amendments are viewed
as successful.
Certain U.K. issuers would now like to provide U.S. holders of listed ADRs with summary reports in place of full annual
reports if the holders do not object. The Commission recently approved a New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') rule change
which allows non-U.S. issuers which are NYSE-listed to mail summary annual reports to U.S. share/ADR holders in lieu
of the full annual report, if permitted by home country practice.

(March 2, 1994).
</FOOTNOTE>


The Exchange is proposing to similarly amend Section 110 of the Exchange's 

Company Guide,

 which is comparable to the NYSE provision described above. Section 110 currently allows the Exchange to consider
the laws, customs and practices of the country where a non-U.S. issuer is domiciled in evaluating the listing eligibility
of a company whose corporate structure or practices are inconsistent with specified rules which apply to domestic
companies, but requires that a full annual report be provided to all U.S. share/ADR holders.
Under the proposed amendment, a U.S. holder would initially receive both reports and then be provided with an ongoing
option to receive either report.

 The summary report would set forth such financial and other information as is required by home country law and would
be required to include a U.S. GAAP reconciliation to the same extent as would be required in the full annual report.
The change would have no impact on the issuer's existing annual and semi-annual SEC reporting obligations.

The Commission notes that, although the U.K. Companies Act requires that shareholders initially receive both reports,
the language of the proposed Amex rule permits non-U.S. issuers to follow home country practices, which may not contain
this requirement.
