BRIEFLY 
Manville Asbestos Trust Overhaul Advances: An appeals court has cleared the way 
for a federal judge in Brooklyn to continue his efforts to overhaul the 
cash-strapped Manville personal injury trust. In the ruling, the U.S. 2nd 
Circuit Court of Appeals denied a motion by lawyers for more than 1,000 
asbestos victims to stop the efforts by U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein, who 
has indicated that he wants the Manville trust to be converted into a national 
fund to pay claims against the less financially secure defendants.
