FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (18): Brokers steal the
limelight - Vincent Boland's guide to doing business in the capital
Those nostalgic for the Prague of dissident playwrights, banned books and
smoke-filled bars full of thirsty workers are in for a shock if they visit
the Czech capital before the end of March.
The government is selling a large slice of the local telephone monopoly to a
foreign investor, and the city is awash with merchant bankers and
telecommunications executives hogging the best restaurant tables and talking
telephone numbers into cellular phones.
The deal - which promises to be the biggest telecoms investment yet in
post-communist eastern Europe, is the high point of a process that has made
Prague a magnet for investors over the past five years.
This is a city where the stock market listings have replaced the Samizdat
publication as the hottest read in town; where the stockbroker and the
corporate lawyer are the people to see; and where a ticket to the opera
still costs next to nothing (if the best seats have not been block-booked by
a merchant banker entertaining visiting telecoms executives).
None of this is immediately apparent on arrival at Prague's Ruzyne airport.
The armed soldiers, glum faces and long queues at passport control suggest
nothing has changed, and the drive into the city in an outrageously
expensive taxi, past row after row of badly constructed panelaky (high-rise
housing) is a reminder that, no matter how much the Czechs might like to
forget it, this was recently a communist country.
Don't be put off. Once in town the atmosphere is transformed. Prague is full
of elegant streets, being brought back to life by new shops, cafes and coats
of paint.
The main hotels are scattered between the centre and the immediate suburbs,
with the Intercontinental, close to Old Town Square, and the Palace, just
off Wenceslas Square, being the most central. The Atrium and the Forum,
overlooking the main motorway through the city, are also close enough for a
quick trip into the centre.
For something a little more luxurious try the newly opened Grand Hotel
Bohemia in the heart of tourist Prague. One of the hotel's main attractions
for business guests is a fax in every room, courtesy of communist-era
telephone lines once used to bug visiting party officials.
The centre of Prague is dotted with bureaux de change, but to avoid
exorbitant commissions change money at the main banks. Banking hours are
usually from 8am to 5pm. The Czech National Bank is pushing to make the
currency, the koruna, fully convertible by 1995, and it has been stable for
the past three years. Current exchange rates are about Kc27.5 to Dollars 1,
Kc43.5 to Pounds 1.00 and Kc17.5 to DM1.00.
The telephone system can be trying (hence the need for new investment).
Dialling within the city is easy, but it is more difficult to get through to
other parts of the country. International calls are also straightforward but
expensive.
Czech time-keeping can be relaxed, but it is better to be on time for
business meetings and the working day begins as early as 7am, although
business meetings generally do not start until 9am. Bring a good supply of
business cards as most people have one, invariably listing the holder's
educational qualifications.
Although the business lunch is becoming more common, initial discussions are
usually held over coffee or juice in the office. Many Czechs are at least
bilingual and English is fast becoming the lingua franca among the Czech
Republic's business community.
After a day's deal-making it is well worth a look around town. The Golden
City, as Prague is known, is one of the most beautiful in the world, with
perfect examples of nearly every type of architecture through the ages, many
of which are being restored to their original splendour.
Czech food is an acquired taste, with an emphasis on pork, game and
calories. Try Au Saint Esprit, the Kampa Klub or V Zatisi for excellent fish
(with prices to match), or U modre kachnlcky (The Blue Duck) for good Czech
dishes. Local wine is cheaper than and just as good as many imported
vintages. The Prague Post or Prognosis, both English-language weeklies, give
listings for restaurants and entertainment.
The favourite Czech method of relaxation is over a glass of beer in a
pivnice (pub). Beer is plentiful and delicious and can cost as little as 25p
a half-litre in local bars where the emphasis is on serious drinking rather
than comfort.
Prague is an easy city to negotiate. Its network of metro, trams and buses
is well-integrated but often overcrowded, especially at rush-hour (7-8.30am
and 4-6pm). The metro is limited but fast and clean, while the trams can be
slow and smelly. Tickets cost Kc6, the fine for not having one Kc200. Beware
of taxis: the city's cab drivers are notorious for over-charging foreigners,
and can be rude and aggressive to those who argue over the size of the fare.
The city is generally safe to walk around at night, although petty crime is
rising. What comes as a shock, however, is the rudeness of store staff,
especially if you visit a tabak, for a newspaper or metro tickets. Remember
that you are only the customer, and therefore the least important person in
the store.
