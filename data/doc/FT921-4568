FT  09 MAR 92 / US Money and Credit: Focus swings to pace of recovery
FORGET the bad news. Cast off the sackcloth and ashes. Start worrying
instead about the speed of the economic recovery.
Analysts who barely one month ago were predicting that another interest rate
cut was on the cards, have turned instead to fretting about the pace of any
upturn.
'It is now most appropriate to focus on the growing indications of a
re-acceleration of economic activity, the likelihood that inflation will
remain at 4 per cent or higher, and the likelihood that large budget
deficits will pressure the capital markets over the balance of the decade,'
suggested Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, in a circular to clients last week.
'There is increasing evidence . . . that the economy is poised for at least
a modest growth rebound in the second quarter,' said Mr David Hale at Kemper
Financial Services.
The steady stream of economic news last week appeared to support such
optimism, causing the yield on the benchmark 30-year long bond to reach 7.92
per cent by late Friday afternoon, compared with 7.79 per cent a week
earlier. This defensive tone, moreover, was evident throughout most of the
week's trading sessions. Only on Wednesday did prices firm slightly as
investors worried about the unemployment data due to be released on Friday,
and then again on Friday afternoon as that news was digested.
In fact, the unemployment figures were probably the most ambiguous
statistics to hit the markets during the five trading sessions. On the one
hand, non-farm payrolls in February rose by 164,000 - well in excess of the
10,000 gain generally predicted. But this was tempered by a significant
re-adjustment in the January figures - the estimated payroll drop of 91,000
was revised to a 149,000 fall.
Moreover most analysts noted that the rise in February's non-farm payrolls
could largely be attributed to the medical services sector and to retailing.
The latter, however, was abnormally depressed in the first quarter of 1991,
partly due to uncertainties induced by the Gulf war.
The headline unemployment figure, meanwhile, rose by 0.2 points to 7.3 per
cent, while most pundits had pitched their estimates at around 7.1 per cent.
As Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities, observed: 'These
two job reports purport to measure the same economy; but they have it going
in different directions in February - a short month, packed with holidays
bearing outsized seasonal factors.'
This muddled picture, however, was in sharp contrast to the positive data
unveiled earlier in the week. On Monday, the national purchasing managers'
index (NPMI) for February rose to 52.4 per cent, compared with 47.4 per cent
in the previous month. Analysts generally had been anticipating a much
smaller improvement.
On Tuesday, moreover, the NPMI data was supported by a sharp advance in the
January index of leading economic indicators, and by a fairly healthy 12.9
per cent surge in new single-home sales that month.
Whether any of this is likely to unlease inflationary forces remains a moot
point, however. Many analysts are sanguine, suggesting that the annual rate
will remain at around 3.5 per cent.
Maverick voices can be heard. DLJ, for example, argues that something over 4
per cent may be more likely. Analysts there note that the year-on-year
inflation rate for the consumer price index, net of food and fuel, has only
dropped below 4 per cent once during the past decade.
Inflation trends will be one of the main focal points in the current week.
On Friday, the February producer price index figures are due to arrive, with
most analysts predicting a modest 0.2 per cent increase in both the 'core'
and overall indices. This would follow a 0.3 per cent fall in the 'non-core'
rate in January, caused primarily by declining energy prices.
A day earlier, attention is likely to centre on the retail sales figures for
the same month. Here, forecasts appear to be more widely spread - from a 0.6
per cent improvement or 0.3 per cent excluding cars, to as much as 0.9 per
cent and 0.5 per cent respectively. Data at the upper end of this scale
would probably convince bond traders that recovery is well under way, and
fuel inflation fears. Bond prices, in turn, could fall further.
