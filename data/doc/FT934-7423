FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Bull chief to unveil restructure
plans today
MR JEAN-MARIE Descarpentries, who took over as head of Groupe Bull last
month, will today announce plans to restructure the loss-making French
computer group with the aim of returning it to profit next year.
The plans, which will be announced to employees, include the creation of a
new top executive board, the establishment of new operating divisions and a
shift in strategy towards computer services. The aim is to prepare the group
for privatisation as quickly as possible.
The reforms face a tough challenge. The group lost FFr1.98bn (Dollars 335m)
in the first half of 1993 and required an injection of FFr7bn of capital
from the state, announced last month, to help cover accumulated losses since
1990.
Mr Bernard Pache, who was replaced by Mr Descarpentries, had targeted 1995
as the date for a return to profit.
The new group structure will comprise three service divisions and four
product divisions. The service divisions, seen as the principal area of
development, include systems integration, computer services and systems
operations. These involve the expansion of maintenance and support
activities for Bull's clients as well as for clients of other computer
manufacturers and the outsourcing of computer services.
The product divisions will include Bull's activities in the manufacture and
distribution of personal and mainframe computers. The group will also seek
to expand sales of software through new sales teams. The new divisions
involve a substantial restructuring of the company. There will no longer,
for example, be a central R&amp;D organisation.
The top management structure is also being reformed. Mr Descarpentries will
preside over a 10-member executive board. This will bring four new members
to the top management, while two existing members of the executive board are
expected to leave.
