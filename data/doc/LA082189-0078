BRIEFLY 
Valley Federal to Sell 5 Branches: The struggling Van Nuys-based thrift agreed 
to sell five branch offices in the San Joaquin Valley to Imperial Savings of 
San Diego for an undisclosed price. Valley Federal, which would have 40 
branches remaining, said it expects to post a "modest" fourth-quarter gain on 
the sale. The company, which lost $3 million last year, said the sale would 
also cut its operating costs by about $2 million a year.
