 

102. As indicated above, circumstances could also arise in which other kinship relationships are used as a means to
evade our eligibility requirements. Because we believe kinship relationships in many cases do not present the same
potential for abuse that exists with spousal relationships, particularly in terms of the ``identity of interests''
that are likely to exist between the persons involved, we shall adopt a more relaxed standard for determining when
kinship interests must be attributed to applicants. In this area, we shall follow the same standard that is applied
by the SBA when interpreting its ``identity of interest'' rule described above. Specifically, an identity of interests
between family members and applicants will be presumed to exist, but the presumption can be rebutted by showing that
the family members are estranged, or that their family ties are remote, or that the family members are not closely related
in business matters.
<FOOTCITE>148</FOOTCITE>
 For purposes of determining who is a family member under this rule, we shall use a definition that is identical to the
definition of ``immediate family member'' in the SBA's rules, 13 CFR 124.100.

103. In appropriate cases, an applicant should be able to rebut the presumption regarding kinship affiliations with
relative ease, simply by demonstrating that the applicant has no close relationship in business matters with the
relevant family members. Of course, should such business relationships arise with a winning applicant after the
auction, we might need to consider whether the applicant intended to circumvent the requirements of our eligibility
rules.
104. The affiliation requirement is intended to prevent entities that, for all practical purposes, do not meet the
size standard required for eligibility from receiving benefits targeted to smaller entities.
<FOOTCITE>149</FOOTCITE>
 We believe that the affiliation rules described above will accomplish this objective.

E. Rural Telephone Company Bidding Credits.


105. 

Petitions. 

NCTA, USIN and SDN argue that the FCC should retain the rural telephone company bidding credit provision adopted in
the 

Second Report and Order 

but delete the accelerated build-out requirement as a condition for receipt of bidding credits. USIN asserts that
bidding credits will not help attract capital when tied to such an expanded build-out requirement. According to USIN,
making bidding credits contingent on an accelerated build-out effectively nullifies the provision because the
commitment of additional capital for network build-out will reduce the amount available to finance the license price
by enough to offset any benefit conferred by the availability of the credit.
<FOOTCITE>150</FOOTCITE>
 SDN agrees that additional build-out should not be required as a prerequisite for rural telephone company bidding
credits, but states that a rural telephone company should receive additional bidding credits if it substantially
covers its certified rural service area during its license term.
<FOOTCITE>151</FOOTCITE>
 NTCA argues that the accelerated build-out requirement for bidding credits should be eliminated since this requirement
is unrelated to the statutory purpose of promoting investment in and rapid deployment of new technologies and services
in rural areas.

106. SDN also contends that the risk of forfeiting the bidding credit (plus interest) for failure to meet the expanded
build-out commitment will have a chilling effect because of the difficulty of anticipating potential problems that
may be encountered in attempting to extend service rapidly to remote areas. Further, SDN maintains that an accelerated
build-out requirement could engender a perverse incentive for a rural telephone company that would otherwise concentrate
primarily on providing PCS service in the rural portions of a BTA or MTA (which, according to SDN might be a commercially-attractive
strategy because of in densely-populated areas.

107. Finally, SDN and USIN contend that it is inequitable to provide rural telephone companies with a less favorable
bidding credit provision than other designated entities. In this regard, USIN argues that the 

Second Report and Order 

fails to explain why rural telephone company bidding credits should contain more restrictive terms than other designated
entity bidding credits. On the contrary, SDN contends that rural telephone companies should receive a greater bidding
credit than other entities, because they face higher service and construction costs. Accordingly, SDN maintains
that if accelerated build-out is to be included in the rural telephone company provision, an incentive should be provided
in the form of bonus credit over and above the standard bidding credit available to other designated entities.

108. 

Discussion. 

In the 

Second Report and Order 

we adopted a system of bidding credits for rural telephone companies designed to further promote the investment in
and rapid deployment of new technologies and services in rural areas.
<FOOTCITE>154</FOOTCITE>
 We generally concluded that any special measures adopted for rural telephone companies, including bidding credits,
should be limited to bidding for licenses, in their rural service areas. We found that this limitation satisfied Congress'
objectives without unduly favoring rural telephone companies in markets where there was no compelling reason to
do so. Specifically, we concluded that Congress was primarily concerned with assuring rural consumers the benefits
of new technologies and providing opportunities for participation by rural telephone companies in the provision
of wireless services that supplement or replace their landline facilities.
<FOOTCITE>155</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, we provided that rural telephone companies would be eligible for bidding credits for specified licenses
only in their service areas.

109. However, unlike bidding credits available to women and minority-owned firms, we linked the amount of the bidding
credit for rural telephone companies to their commitment to achieve certain expanded infrastructure build-out
requirements in their rural service areas. We provided that the amount of the bidding credit would be proportionately
linked to the amount by which the rural telephone company agreed to expand its build-out commitment. In this regard,
we indicated that failure to meet the expanded build-out commitment would result in liability for a penalty in the
amount of the bidding credit, plus interest at the rate applicable to installment payments. We further provided that
grant of the licenses to rural telephone companies utilizing bidding credits would be conditioned upon payment of
this penalty, if and when it becomes applicable. We concluded that this added construction requirement would fulfill
the congressional objective of developing and rapidly deploying new services to those residing in rural areas.
