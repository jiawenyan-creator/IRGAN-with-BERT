FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Dutch financial group advances
A strong performance in insurance helped ING Group, the Dutch financial
services company, to boost first-half net profit by 19.9 per cent to Fl
1.07bn (Dollars 610m) from Fl 892m a year earlier.
Pre-tax insurance results were up 31 per cent, far outstripping the 9.1 per
cent rise in banking earnings.
The company gave no separate figures for the second quarter.
However, comparisons with the first-quarter results published in June showed
that growth in earnings slowed to 12.5 per cent in the quarter from 26.8 per
cent in the first three months of the year.
First-quarter results had also shown the same pattern of significant
increases in insurance and flatter growth in banking.
For the full year, ING forecast that net profit per share would at least
match the 1993 result of Fl 8.06.
ING's banking results in the first half were affected by a sharp turnround
in results from trading in Latin American debt securities, mainly in the
first quarter of the year.
Its results from financial transactions, securities and participations fell
into a loss of Fl 8m in the first six months from a profit of Fl 566m a year
earlier.
In insurance, results were helped by buoyant earnings in life insurance,
ING's single largest business, which saw a 25.2 per cent increase.
Results were also aided by the decision in April 1993 to deconsolidate two
loss-making subsidiaries, Orion in the UK and NRG, its reinsurance business.
