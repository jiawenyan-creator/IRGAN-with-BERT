SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:






Authority: 

Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended; section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C.
1854).




On July 29, 1994, under the terms of Section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended, the Government of the United
States requested consultations with the Government of Nepal with respect to cotton and man-made fiber dresses in
Categories 336/636, produced or manufactured in Nepal.

The purpose of this notice is to advise the public that, if no solution is agreed upon in consultations with the Government
of Nepal, the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements may later establish a limit for the entry and
withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of cotton and man-made fiber textile products in Categories 336/636,
produced or manufactured in Nepal and exported during the twelve-month period which began on July 29, 1994 and extends
through July 28, 1995, at a level of not less than 146,656 dozen.

A summary market statement concerning Categories 336/636 follows this notice.

Anyone wishing to comment or provide data or information regarding the treatment of Categories 336/636, or to comment
on domestic production or availability of products included in Categories 336/636, is invited to submit 10 copies
of such comments or information to Rita D. Hayes, Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements,
U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; ATTN: Helen L. LeGrande. The comments received will be considered
in the context of the consultations with the Government of Nepal.

Because the exact timing of the consultations is not yet certain, comments should be submitted promptly. Comments
or information submitted in response to this notice will be available for public inspection in the Office of Textiles
and Apparel, room H3100, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.

Further comments may be invited regarding particular comments or information received from the public which the
Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements considers appropriate for further consideration.

The solicitation of comments regarding any aspect of the agreement or the implementation thereof is not a waiver in
any respect of the exemption contained in 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1) relating to matters which constitute ``a foreign affairs
function of the United States.''

The United States remains committed to finding a solution concerning Categories 336/636. Should such a solution
be reached in consultations with the Government of Nepal, further notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

.

A description of the textile and apparel categories in terms of HTS numbers is available in the CORRELATION: Textile
and Apparel Categories with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (see 

Federal Register

Import Situation and Conclusion



U.S. imports of cotton and manmade fiber dresses, Category 336/636, from Nepal reached 174,621 dozen during the year
ending May 1994, three times the 58,596 dozen shipped during the year ending May 1993. During the first five months
of 1994, imports of Category 336/636 from Nepal surged to 138,555 dozen, more than triple the 42,801 dozen imported
during the same period in 1993 and nearly double Nepal's total calendar year 1993 level.
 
The sharp and substantial increase of Category 336/636 imports from Nepal is disrupting the U.S. market for cotton
and manmade fiber dresses.

dozen in 1993, a decrease of 17 percent. In contrast, U.S. imports of cotton and manmade fiber dresses, Category 336/636,

are surging in 1994, increasing 33 percent in the first five months of 1994 over the January-May 1993 level.

The ratio of imports to domestic production increased from 39 percent in 1989 to 50 percent in 1993. The domestic manufacturers'
