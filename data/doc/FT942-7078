FT  27 MAY 94 / Patten sees a new Manchester in the east
Mr Chris Patten last night forecast a 'spectacular future' for Hong Kong
provided that the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, under which the
territory will return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, is fully implemented.
Speaking in Manchester's Great Hall, he said: 'It will play the role in
relation to the Chinese economy which Manchester played in the British
industrial revolution and which New York played in the opening up of the
American continent.'
But if the 1984 accord was not fully implemented, he said, the
characteristics which made Hong Kong special would be in jeopardy. These, he
said, were 'the rule of law, a free press, a high level of resistance to
corruption'.
'Hong Kong will no longer be special and the potential offered by the
historic 'one country, two systems' concept will have been squandered.'
Mounting a spirited defence of his proposals for electoral reform, he poured
scorn on suggestions - made by British businessmen and former diplomats -
that Britain should opt for a 'quiet life' since its longer-term interest
was in having good relations with China.
Britain, he said, had huge investments in Hong Kong and large exports.
'Securing Hong Kong's future, which is dependent on its special nature
enduring indefinitely, is a clear national interest.' Moreover, he said,
there was 'a place for integrity as well as interests in foreign policy'.
Hong Kong - like Manchester, the governor said - had grown on the basis of
free trade and open markets. But he detected growing protectionism in Europe
and the US. Some in Europe sought to justify protectionism on the grounds
that poorer countries did not have the same social infrastructure as Europe.
'This amounts to the absurd and callous proposition that to be poor is
somehow to have an unfair trade advantage.'
