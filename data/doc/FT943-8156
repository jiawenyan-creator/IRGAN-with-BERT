copper/gold mines in the Far East, has shut down for four months and laid
off 3,000 employees, a union counsel said, Reuter reports from Cebu City.

damaged by a typhoon late last year.

USDollars 104m of debt and Dollars 8.0m in interest and penalties. It
expects to see a Dollars 42.4m gain on its third quarter earnings from the
sale of power plants to the Toledo Power Company and the debt settlement.
Atlas said net operating revenues for the six months ended June 30 were
Dollars 10.3m compared to Dollars 38.1m. Net losses for the period were
Dollars 14.7m against Dollars 14.1m.
Atlas B shares are listed on the American Stock Exchange. The company said
it did not currently meet the exchange's listing guidelines and was unsure
if the listing would be continued.
