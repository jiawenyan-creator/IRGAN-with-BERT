REBOUND ON WALL STREET; 
CURRENCY; 
DOLLAR CLOSES MIXED AFTER RISING ABROAD 
The dollar finished mixed in hectic U.S. trading Monday after rising on 
overseas markets early in the day in response to the rebound of the Dow Jones 
stock market index. 
Analysts said a rebound in the Dow Jones industrial index was responsible for 
the dollar's improved showing in domestic trading compared to closing levels 
overseas. The dollar finished below Friday's closing levels in New York in 
relation to the West German mark, Japanese yen and Swiss franc. 
The rise in blue chip stock prices in New York, after the big selloff Friday, 
was viewed as taking some of the pressure for lower interest rates off the 
Federal Reserve Board. 
In Tokyo, where trading ends before the business day begins in Europe, the 
dollar fell to 140.75 yen from 144.00 yen Friday. Later, in London, the dollar 
was quoted at 141.10 yen. In New York, the dollar finished at 141.80 yen, still 
below its level of 142.05 yen Friday. 
In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, which rose to $1.5820 
from $1.5625 late Friday. But the pound declined in relation to the dollar in 
New York, to $1.5750 from $1.5820 on Friday. 
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Friday's rate, included: 
1.8680 West German marks, down from 1.8720; 1.6340 Swiss francs, down from 
1.6420.
