FT  22 JUN 93 / Another sharp fall in TUC numbers
THE PERCENTAGE of the workforce who are members of unions affiliated to the
Trades Union Congress has fallen below 30 per cent for the first time in
several decades, provisional figures to be presented to tomorrow's TUC
general council will show, David Goodhart writes.
The membership records of 65 unions show a sharper fall last year than in
1991 with the affiliated membership total falling by 480,000 to 7.3m, the
lowest level since 1946. The 6.2 per cent fall in total membership was
unevenly distributed, with the engineering section of the AEEU craft union
falling by 13 per cent to 541,000 but 17 unions, mainly in the public
sector, increasing membership.
The fall in union membership was nearly 100,000 more than the increase in
registered unemployment over the period. But although union density has
fallen below 30 per cent in relation to the workforce as a whole it remains
at about 33 per cent for people in employment.
Britain continues to have one of the highest levels of union density in
Europe but has probably been overtaken by Germany.
For the first time since the 1920s the TGWU general union, with 1.03m
members, took second place to Unison, the new public services union created
from a merger of three unions, which has 1.48m members.
The GMB general union fell from 862,000 to 799,101, and the MSF white-collar
union fell from 604,000 to 552,000.
Other unions that have suffered big membership losses include the National
Communications Union down to 126,376, the National Union of Mineworkers down
to 32,947 and Usdaw, the shopworkers union, down to 316,491.
The fall in membership means that the TUC general council will now have 46
members instead of 50.
