FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Dyno almost doubles profits
Dyno Industrier, the big Norwegian explosives and chemicals producer,
yesterday reported 1993 pre-tax profits almost doubled as sales advanced 10
per cent, helped by acquisitions, stronger chemicals operations and firmer
south-east Asian markets.
Nevertheless, the board proposed to leave the 1993 dividend unchanged at
NKr2 a share.
Group pre-tax profit rose to NKr307m (Dollars 41m) from NKr161m, as sales
increased by NKr745m to NKr8.23bn. Operating profit rose to NKr414m from
NKr329m.
Operating expenses increased by NKr612m to NKr7.3bn, as depreciation rose by
NKr48m to NKr514m.
Mr Arild Ingierd, president, said the result was acceptable but not
satisfactory, and noted that the plastics division is operating at a loss
due to high investment costs for equipment needed to escalate deliveries of
plastic fuel tanks.
Gains of NKr55m on securities in 1993 were achieved, against losses of
NKr32m in 1992.
Dyno said that about 85 per cent of its operations are now based outside
Norway. It anticipates continued growth in south-east Asia, but North
American and European markets still suffer from excess capacity and tougher
competition.
