JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS 
For 18 years, Bernice Lewis has been the Mother Superior of the singles set. 
You want to visit Las Vegas, alone or with a group? Ring up Lewis. How about 
Hawaii, the Caribbean, the Soviet Union? Buzz Lewis. Whatever the destination, 
Lewis is ready to advise the single traveler. Lewis has been counseling singles 
since shortly after being widowed in 1971. Alone for the first time in years, 
she was apprehensive about traveling solo. Others, she concluded, probably 
shared her fears. That's when Lewis became the guru among singles. Widows, 
divorced men, young singles. She counsels individuals concerning their fears, 
nurses them along as they plan their journeys. Right up to the moment of 
departure. These are one-on-one discussions. And although this isn't a dating 
game, Lewis often puts singles together for companionship as well as economy 
(avoiding the aggravating single supplement). Recently, Lewis sent a doctor off 
to Europe with other singles. The lady reported back that she had a "fabulous 
time." Lewis has been called upon to arrange honeymoons for singles who meet on 
trips. Primarily, though, her objective is to put joy into travel for singles. 
"I understand their fears," she says.

2950, East Rochester, N.Y., (800) 535-3303. Rates from $353 a week in the

Depot Inn: B.R. of Riverside asks about "out of the ordinary" accommodations in 
Northern California. We know of a turn-of-the-century railroad station that's 
been converted into a B&amp;B near Santa Rosa. The Melitta Station Inn once 
served passengers on Southern Pacific's run between Santa Rosa and Sonoma. 
Before this it operated as a stagecoach stop. Six guest rooms (four with 
private baths). Antiques, country collectables, a wood-burning stove. A chance 
to step back to a less hurried era. Stop for the night or spend several days. 
Activities include visits to wineries, Jack London State Park, fishing, biking, 
riding. 
Melitta Station Inn, 5850 Melita Road, Santa Rosa, Calif. 95409. Call (707) 
538-7712. Rates: $65/$80. 
Wilderness Travel: If you're considering an adventure vacation, write for the 
new catalogue produced by Wilderness Travel of Berkeley. A slick giveaway. One

San Francisco: Hotel reservations in San Francisco can be booked with a single 
toll-free phone call. San Francisco Lodging represents dozens of hotels, 
B&amp;Bs, inns in the Bay Area. Everything from boutique hotels to restored 
mansions. Savings over high-season summer rates. Besides accommodations, SFL 
books car rentals, airport transfers, limousines, restaurant reservations, 
excursions, sightseeing. San Francisco is decked out for Christmas. A good time 
to visit. 
San Francisco Lodging: (800) 356-7567. This is a free service. 
Corsica: I've been fascinated with Corsica ever since I listened one night to a 
radiator salesman and a maid singing a duet in a smoky club in Ajaccio. It was 
like a scene in Rick's joint in the film "Casablanca." And although the 
radiator salesman and the maid were mere amateurs, they sang with soul. For 
nearly an hour the audience shouted for encores. It was the kind of spontaneous 
action for which Corsicans are famous. Corsica isn't one of those picture-post 
card islands you see on calendars. It's like no other island in any ocean. Old 
World villages. Peaks that spike clouds. Narrow, winding roads that plunge like 
a roller coaster. (Corsica is only a short boat trip off the French/Italian 
coast). 
For the young and curious, here's a chance to spend three weeks on Corsica next 
summer learning French. The package ($770) includes accommodations with a 
Corsican family, breakfast, lessons, excursions. Ages 16 and older. Starting 
dates: July 1, July 25, Aug. 5, Aug. 19, Sept. 2. A special seniors session is 
planned for September.

Toro 92630, (714) 458-8868.

for Americans wishing to avoid carrying their own skis on airplanes/trains.
