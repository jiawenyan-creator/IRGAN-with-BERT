FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: British Fittings turns in reduced loss of
Pounds 1.44m
BRITISH FITTINGS Group has started to emerge from the problems of 1991 when,
a week before it expected to announce pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.8m, it
uncovered a series of stock thefts and accounting errors which led instead
to heavy losses.
In the 1992 year the Birmingham-based group incurred a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 1.44m, against a restated deficit of Pounds 3.57m.
'The slate is clean now,' declared Mr Cecil Buckett, brought in last May as
finance director of the pipeline equipment distribution, high pressure water
products and non-ferrous metals distribution group.
Over the past year, the group has installed new accounting systems and
reduced its operational cost base. 'This year we're in profit, we're fairly
close to budget,' said Mr Brian Stanton, chief executive. 'We're not banking
on a major upturn. We have geared the company to make a profit in the
present climate.'
Against this background, and despite losses per share of 5.41p, a final
dividend of 1p is declared, bringing the total for the year to 1.5p. Last
time, the total distribution was 5.375p after losses per share of 14.49p.
A financial restructuring, which involved a partial withdrawal from
non-ferrous metals distribution and a reduction in working capital needs as
tighter stock control was exercised, cut borrowings and reduced gearing by
the year end to 66 per cent, from 75 per cent in June 1992.
In trading conditions described by Mr Michael Borlenghi, chairman, as
'extremely difficult, particularly in the construction industry and
especially in the last quarter of the year,' turnover fell 7 per cent from
Pounds 82.8m to Pounds 77m, and operating profit from Pounds 1.77m to Pounds
1.59m.
Exceptional charges of Pounds 542,000 compared with Pounds 2.09m in 1991,
largely to pay for 150 redundancies.
Below the line, the group took extraordinary charges of Pounds 1.95m,
against Pounds 1.18m, to pay for the closure of a non-ferrous metals
business.
