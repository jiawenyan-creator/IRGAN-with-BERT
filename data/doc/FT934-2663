FT  13 DEC 93 / TUC wins cash for works groups
The European Union has agreed to finance the Trades Union Congress in its
efforts to win support for works councils inside Britain's largest
transnational corporations.
The EU move, aimed at encouraging employers and unions to set up
consultative bodies within British companies, is likely to infuriate the
government.
British ministers strongly opposed the EU directive on works councils, which
is likely to come into force by the end of next year.
The EU - at the instigation of the European Parliament - has allocated
Pounds 190,000 to the TUC which it can spend next year on campaigning for
works councils among the largest British companies.
The TUC has appointed Mr Nick Clark, an official from the GMPU print union,
as a full-time officer to carry out the work. The EU has spent about Pounds
24m over the past two years funding meetings of workers employed by
transnationals in preparation for the works council directive.
The TUC believes large British companies will be affected by the directive
in spite of the opt-out from the social chapter secured two years ago by the
British government.
Britain's large transnationals with more than 100 employees in two or more
EU countries will have to provide a works council for their workers in the
other 11 states of the EU and also in Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway
which are members of the European Economic Area.
The TUC believes British companies will have to include their British
workers on the works councils because it will be impracticable for them to
create such bodies for their foreign employees alone.
Many of Britain's more progressive large blue-chip companies with well
established worker participation schemes, such as Imperial Chemical
Industries and Unilever, will be urged by the TUC to establish a
European-wide works council for all their employees as soon as possible.
