FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Microvitec offshoot in MBO for Pounds 2.5m
Microvitec, the information systems and services group, has sold its Logitek
distribution business to management for Pounds 2.49m cash, reducing gearing
to under 50 per cent.
Net asset value of the loss-making business is about Pounds 3m. The second
half 1992 results of Microvitec were affected by depressed sales and low
margins in Logitek, and that had been a factor in the decision to sell.
Microvitec will now concentrate on its core businesses of designing,
manufacturing and selling products, providing systems integration solutions
and maintenance and software applications in the publishing and accountancy
markets.
It will hold a 20 per cent stake in the purchaser, to be called Logitek
Distribution.
