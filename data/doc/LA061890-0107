CUBA SUGAR CROP TOPS HOPES AT 8 MILLION TONS 
Cuba surprised international analysts today by announcing a 
higher-than-expected 1989-90 sugar production figure of just over 8 million 
tons after a harvest marked by bad weather and technical problems. 
Granma, the official Communist Party newspaper, described the 8.04-million-ton 
crop as a "real labor achievement by our workers." Sugar is the traditional 
mainstay of the Cuban economy, and the island is the world's biggest exporter.
