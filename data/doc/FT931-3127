FT  17 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Oman and India plan gas line
OMAN and India have reached preliminary agreement to build an undersea gas
pipeline capable of delivering 50m cubic metres of Omani gas a day to
industries on India's west coast. Gulf oil executives say the deal will be
worth around Dollars 4.5bn and could be completed within four years.
The two states have also agreed to build two 120,000 b/d oil refineries in
India, with the Omani government partnering India's Hindustan Petroleum and
Baharat Oil.
The Oman Oil Company, an arm of the country's oil and finance ministries, is
to conduct a feasibility study on the 900km pipeline, which would have to
pass over the continental shelf off Iran and Pakistan.
Oil industry officials said a substantial part of the deal was likely to be
financed by export credits. Oman has reportedly proposed a 40-year gas
supply contract.
The Oman Oil Company has also signed a deal to link Kazakhstan's biggest
oilfield with a coastal terminal. Both deals are part of Oman's attempts to
diversify and broaden its hydrocarbons industry.
The gas deal with India would give Oman a reliable local market for its gas,
proven reserves of which have doubled in the last two years to 490bn cu m.
Oman will also supply crude oil for the two refineries to be built in India.
