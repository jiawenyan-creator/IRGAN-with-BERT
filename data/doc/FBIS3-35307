  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 22, IRNA -- President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani here Tuesday introduced his candidate for the 
post of minister of culture and Islamic guidance Mostafa 
Mirsalim to Majlis deputies who are to cast their votes on him 
today. Addressing the deputies, Rafsanjani referred to Mirsalim 
as a "veteran revolutionary" with a record of political and 
cultural activities since being a university student. He noted 
that the leader of the Islamic revolution Ayatollah 'Ali 
Khamene'i is highly satisfied with Mirsalim. "He used to be one 
of my active advisors with a prominant role in the Supreme 
Council of Cultural Revolution," Rafsanjani added. 
  He said he expected that Mirsalim, "gaining a powerful vote 
of the Majlis, would enjoy a good executive support for 
fulfilling this difficult task." 
  Rafsanjani also appreciated the services of 'Ali Larijani 
who 
vacated the ministerial seat after being appointed by the leader 
as the new chief of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting 
(IRIB).
