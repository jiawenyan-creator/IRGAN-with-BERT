  [Text] The anti-crime decree was drafted in 24 hours and 
was signed by President Yeltsin in the morning of June 15, 
shortly before his departure to the Far East, a well-informed 
Kremlin source told Interfax. He said that the idea of taking 
urgent additional measures to combat organized crime had been 
initiated by the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS), and 
that the Interior Ministry had insisted that it be documented in 
a decree, not in a law. 
  He also said that in the middle of June, FCS 
Director-General 
Sergey Stepashin sent a letter to President Yeltsin urging him 
to draft a law on amending and enlarging the Criminal Code and 
submitting it to the State Duma. Concurrently, the idea was 
proposed of passing a decree on measures to step up the campaign 
against organized crime. 
  The source maintains that the decree provided for measures 
which did not go beyond the president's constitutional powers. 
Other measures were to be implemented after the parliament 
adopted the draft law submitted by the president. 
  In actual fact, another version, proposed by Interior 
Minister Viktor Yerin and by his first deputy Mikhail Yegorov, 
was adopted. In a slightly softened form, this version was used 
as the foundation for the presidential decree. 
  The source said that the draft decree had been signed by the 
FCS's First Deputy Director-General Anatoliy Safonov, not by 
Stepashin who left for the Far East on June 13.
