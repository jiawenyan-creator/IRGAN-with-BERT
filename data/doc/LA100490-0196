SPOTLIGHT; 
CRAIG HARTLEY OCCIDENTAL 
Football Running back 
Senior 6-foot, 185 pounds 
Craig Hartley, who hopes to become a podiatrist some day, used some fancy 
footwork to gain 228 yards in his debut at tailback Saturday for Occidental 
College. 
A converted defensive back, Hartley carried 39 times, although he barely made 
it to the field. 
"I started off breathing so hard, I couldn't catch my breath because I was so 
excited," Hartley said. "I was gasping because I had gotten myself so worked 
up." 
The reaction was understandable. For three years Hartley has been a starter at 
defensive back. But when Brian Madlangbayan -- who was filling in for starting 
tailback Gary Little -- went out with a sprained neck, Hartley was called in 
against La Verne, which Occidental defeated, 38-27. 
Hartley, a history major who plans to follow his father into podiatry, got word 
he would be starting at tailback only three days before the game. He had been a 
part-time running back at McCullough High in Woodlands, Tex., located an hour 
north of Houston in the heart of oil country. 
In Woodlands, Occidental is the name of a petroleum company, not a college. 
Whatever, Hartley proved to be a slippery fellow against La Verne.
