  [Text] Pusan, May 16 (YONHAP) -- Twenty-two South Korean 
fishermen caught by Chinese patrol boats in the East China Sea 
late last month were set free in Shanghai, China Sunday and on 
their way home aboard one of their boats. 
  Eleven of the fishermen are those of Taehung-ho No. 27 and 
the remainder the crew of Songkwang-ho No. 2, both based in 
Pusan. 
  Officials of the National Fisheries Administration and the 
fishery companies they belong to said Monday the 22 fishermen 
are set to arrive in the Pusan harbor on Tuesday afternoon 
aboard Taehung-ho No. 27. 
  It was reported earlier in the day that Korea agreed with 
China to pay 13,728 U.S. dollars in return for their release. 
China earlier demanded 100,000 dollars. 
  Songkwang-ho No. 2 was cut loose after its crews were 
transferred to a Chinese patrol vessel when a nearby South 
Korean fishing boat followed the patrol ship towing Songkwang-ho 
No. 2 during the seizure on April 29.
