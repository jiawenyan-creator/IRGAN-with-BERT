  [Text] Vienna, June 17 (AFP) -- A convention on the safety 
of civilian nuclear power plants was adopted in Vienna on Friday 
[17 June] by an international conference grouping 
representatives of 84 countries. 
  It is to be signed here next September, on the sidelines of 
the annual general conference of the Vienna-based International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The agreement is based on the principle that safety of 
nuclear plants is within the sole jurisdiction of the countries 
maintaining them, and it does not provide for any inspection 
mechanism to ensure required safety standards are met. 
  The standards laid down by the conference relate to sites, 
construction plans, installation maintenance, control systems 
and measures to be taken in case of emergency.
