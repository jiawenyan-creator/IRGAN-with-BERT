  [Text] While foreign quarters are moving in an active and 
coordinated manner to achieve Kliridhis-Denktas talks in 
mid-February, developments continue to confirm the assessments 
of AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People]. 
  Specifically, following the assessment of UN official 
Gustave 
Feissel, who does not believe that the Denktas letter includes 
conditions, U.S. State Department Special Coordinator on the 
Cyprus Issue Robert Lamb has judged the Denktas letter as 
acceptable. The foreigners do not attach so much importance to 
the "titles" of Denktas and the letterheads and the principles 
or thoughts that he expresses, but are concentrating on the 
substance: that he agrees to discuss the three UN documents, 
and in the end that is what counts. 
  We do not think that under the circumstances the Greek 
Cypriot side will have the ease to say "no" to a call by the UN 
secretary general for talks. For this reason, we repeat that 
the political leaders should meet and make collective decisions 
on the handling [of the Cyprus issue].
