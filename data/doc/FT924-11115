FT  28 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Levercrest launches Pounds 1.3m rights
issue to fund fresh strategy
LEVERCREST, the playground equipment, street furniture and rubber safety
surfacing maker, is raising Pounds 1.3m net through a rights issue and will
execute a new strategy to pursue acquisitions in the engineering sector.
This will be achieved under a new chairman, Mr Ian Orrock.
Mr Orrock, assisting the board for the last three months as a consultant, is
now a director and will become chairman following an EGM on November 19.
The rights issue is on a 13-for-4 basis at 10p per share, and will be used
to reduce borrowings substantially, rationalise and improve manufacturing
processes, and strengthen sales and marketing functions.
The group will change its name to Roxspur and move from the USM to a full
listing.
In the 14 months to May 31, the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
755,000 (Pounds 364,000) from turnover of Pounds 5.46m (Pounds 5.52m).
Losses per share were 13.6p (5.9p).
Trading was difficult, there was a sizeable loss through the 'substantial'
theft of raw materials and finished goods, and exceptional charges of Pounds
54,000.
The current year began satisfactorily and there were indications that local
authority spending would be higher.
