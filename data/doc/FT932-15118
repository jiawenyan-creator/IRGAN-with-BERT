FT  15 APR 93 / The Finance Bill: Names' affairs simplified by rules -
Lloyd's
YESTERDAY'S finance bill contains nothing to surprise tax practitioners who
specialise in the affairs of troubled Lloyd's insurance market.
'Above all the new rules simplify taxation arrangements for Names and make
them easier,' said Mr Mike Voller, specialist with BDO Binder Hamlyn, the
accountancy firm. He said the bill simply supplied greater detail about
changes first announced in last month's Budget.
He is positive about new arrangements for reserving, which 'make it much
more attractive to be in Lloyd's, always assuming that Lloyd's can do
something to clear the decks of its past problems.'
The new arrangements do nothing to help Names already hit by heavy losses,
but allow them to establish tax-free reserves against heavy losses they may
incur in the future.
Under the new arrangements - which come into in effect to cover the 1992
underwriting year - Names will be able to transfer up to 50 per cent of
profits to the new reserve each year, provided the value of the funds in the
reserve does not exceed 50 per cent of the Name's overall premium income
limit. Amounts withdrawn will be made to fund losses or cash calls
withdrawals that are not used to meet losses will attract tax.
