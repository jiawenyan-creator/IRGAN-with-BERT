  [Abstract] Anodic oxidation is used widely in 
micro-electronics to make dielectric layers having a 
metal-dielectric-semiconductor structure (MDP). In making an MDP 
based on the intermetallide In-Sb (a p-type semiconductor), the 
dielectric layer 
In[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-Sb[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/] is 
prepared by anodizing In-Sb in the corresponding electrolytes. 
It is well known that the structure of the anode oxide coating 
is a most important factor which determines its electro-physical 
properties. The properties of the materials may be altered by 
doping the oxide coating. Thus doping the surface layer of 
Nb[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/] dielectric with indium 
significantly improves the electro-physical properties of the 
system Nb-Nb[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/]-MnO[.sub]2[/]. In 
another work it was demonstrated that the doping elements may 
also be added to the composition of the anode oxide coating by 
including them in the anode reaction in the anode form. In the 
present work a study was made of the effects of niobium 
alcoholate on the process of anode oxidation of the 
semiconductor In-Sb in a glycerate solution of sodium carbonate. 
It was demonstrated that there is an acceleration in the 
formation of the dielectric film 
In[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-Sb[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/] when 
doped with niobium ethylate. Possible causes for this 
accelerating effect are discussed. Figures 2; references 6
