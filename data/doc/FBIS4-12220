  [Text] This morning's terrorist attack at the Ashdod 
Junction was perpetrated by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
member 'Ali 'Abdallah, a 21-year-old resident of the al-Shati' 
refugee camp. 
  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that a leaflet signed by 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, the military arm of Hamas, was 
distributed in the Gaza Strip today. The leaflet stated that 
yesterday's terrorist attack in 'Afula was carried out by a 
squad member to avenge the Hebron massacre. The leaflet warned 
that another four retaliatory attacks are to be expected. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0830 GMT on 7 April reports 
that "Hamas has assumed responsibility for this morning's 
murderous terrorist attack in Ashdod. In a leaflet distributed a 
short while ago, Hamas warns that another three attacks are 
expected in order to complete what Hamas describes as five 
presents to the Zionist people to mark next week's Independence 
Day."]
