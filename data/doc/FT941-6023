FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Resort sells 4 hotels for Pounds 7.3m
Resort Hotels has sold four of its 50 hotels for Pounds 7.28m to Cairn
Hotels, a subsidiary of Bank of Scotland, one of its banks.
The company said the consideration was based on the latest valuation, and
included the freeholds. Proceeds would be used to reduce debt. Resort shares
have been suspended since last July.
Accounts for the year to end-April 1993 have not yet been published because
of difficulties in finalising property valuations. Resort called in
independent consultants last July to investigate financing issues.
The trade and industry department has granted the group until the end of
this month to publish the accounts.
Mr Roland Lewis, acting managing director, said yesterday that the group's
strategy was to maximise immediate profitability, which called for 'some
pruning of our network especially in areas where we are densely
represented'.
