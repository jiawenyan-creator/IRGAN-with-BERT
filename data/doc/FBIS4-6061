  [Text] The ASAHI SHIMBUN forum on the "Japanese-U.S. 
European Economic War" to discuss economic issues among Japan, 
the United States, and Europe opened at a hotel in 
Uchisaiwai-cho, Tokyo, on 13 April. Michel Albert, member of 
the French Banking and Financial Policy Commission; Professor 
Lester Sallow [name as published] of the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology; and former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, 
exchanged views on the capitalist society, Japan-U.S. trade 
frictions, and other issues before an audience of around 700. 
  On the stalled Japan-U.S. framework talks, Sallow strongly 
criticized the closedness of the Japanese market. He said: "It 
might be better to simply end the negotiations. The problem is 
quite clear: Japan does not import enough." He also stated, 
"If Japan does not increase its imports, other countries will 
have to stop their imports from Japan." Sallow strongly urged 
the expansion of domestic demand. 
  In response, Miyazawa said, "Many of our exports to the 
United States form an integral part of the U.S. economy. Japan 
should increase its imports rather than reduce its exports." 
  Albert pointed out that, "In Japan, the distribution 
industry 
has very low productivity. The consumers are paying for high 
production cost. Furthermore, formidable land prices are also a 
problem." He expressed the opinion that reform of the economic 
structure is necessary to promote the expansion of domestic 
demand through deregulation to lower commodity prices, and other 
measures.
