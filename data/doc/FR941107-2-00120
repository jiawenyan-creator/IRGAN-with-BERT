<DOCTITLE>Dana Corporation; Pueblo, CO; Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>



On October 24, 1994, the company requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice of
Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject
firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on October 11, 1994 and will soon be published in the 

Federal Register.

The company submitted additional information showing a worker separations and increased imports in 1994.



Conclusion



After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.




Signed at Washington, D.C., this 27th day of October 1994.
