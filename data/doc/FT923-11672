FT  23 JUL 92 / Welfare cost fears dismissed
FEARS that thousands of European Community citizens living outside Britain
will add millions to the bill for UK welfare benefits are groundless, the
government said yesterday.
The scare arose after a ruling in the European Court of Justice that the UK
government was wrong to deny family credit, which is designed to supplement
low incomes, to the wife of a civil servant who worked in Northern Ireland
but lived in the Irish Republic. The court held that the UK's arguments
would impede freedom of movement for workers.
The ruling means that people who travel to work in Britain leaving
dependants behind in their home states will be able to claim family credit
on behalf of their families.
'We are not expecting a flood of successful claims costing the Treasury
millions,' the Department of Social Security said. 'You have to be on a low
income to qualify for it, and most EC workers either bring their families
with them or are single with no dependants.'
