GUNS 
As a member of the NRA, I think there ought to be a referee to whom I could 
complain that the magazine published a picture of a NRA member clowning in a 
Darth Vader-ish helmet and then showed gun-controller Sen. Dennis DeConcini 
smiling under a ceiling light that gave the effect of a halo.
