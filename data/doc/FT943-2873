FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Nestle net held back by strength
of Swiss franc
Nestle, the world's largest foods group, said its first-half net income
edged ahead by 1.7 per cent to SFr1.27bn (Dollars 984m), with growth
depressed mainly by the strength of the Swiss franc.
The currency effect masked what it called 'a number of very positive
trends'. Underlying sales volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions and
disposals, grew 3 per cent, compared with only 1 per cent in the first half
of 1993, and trading profit advanced 5.1 per cent to SFr2.8bn.
The total value of sales was unchanged at SFr27.4bn, but up 6.4 per cent in
constant currency terms.
The group forecasts faster net profit growth in the second half. It said
sales could also rise slightly, provided the exchange rates of the principal
currencies 'regain a degree of stability by the end of the year'.
Nestle makes over 98 per cent of its sales outside of Switzerland.
In a period when the Swiss franc rose strongly against the US dollar and all
the main European currencies, the negative effect of translating foreign
currency earnings into francs is substantial.
It also has an impact on the valuation of overseas assets. In the first
half, the group charged SFr338m against net income for the decline in Swiss
franc terms of overseas assets, especially those in hyperinflationary
Brazil.
Sales volumes rose steadily in both North and South America, and
'vigorously' in east Asia. The decline of sales in Europe was halted. The
recent rise in coffee prices has not had a material effect on the group.
Net financing charges were down 17 per cent to SFr362m, reflecting lower
levels of debt and lower interest rates.
At the end of June, the group's net indebtedness stood at SFr8.6bn, compared
with SFr10.4bn a year earlier, mainly as a result of strong cash flow.
