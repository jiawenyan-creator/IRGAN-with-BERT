FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Gt Southern attacks 'knockdown price'
Great Southern Group, the funeral operator that has become the target of
Service Corporation International, the US funeral group, yesterday issued
its defence document, claiming the 600p hostile offer was a 'knockdown
price'.
Great Southern emphasised the 252 per cent increase in its share price since
its October 1986 flotation - even before the offer - and its activity in
building up its crematoria and funeral businesses, through acquisitions.
In addition, it claims SCI 'shows no understanding of Great Southern's
business or the UK funeral industry', and has not done the homework
necessary to be the 'careful custodian' of its traditions.
Shareholders appear likely to head the call to 'ignore the offer'. The
shares closed yesterday 1p higher at 609p, suggesting the expectation that
it will be raised.
More importantly, the Field family, who control 56 per cent of its shares,
have said the bid price is 'unacceptable', and the offer is contingent upon
acceptance by the family holding company JD Field.
The document claims that the company offers profits growth from its recent
programme of expanding its crematoria, and the success of Chosen Heritage,
its successful pre-paid funeral scheme, which has a 65 per cent UK market
share.
SCI is clearly convinced of the attractions. Mr Bill Heiligbrodt, SCI
president, returns to London tomorrow and is expected to endeavour to sound
out a price which will tempt the Fields to sell.
The offer is due to close next Tuesday.
