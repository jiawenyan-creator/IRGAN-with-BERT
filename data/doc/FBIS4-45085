  [Text] New Delhi, May 26 (PTI) -- The Government should 
create an Indian common market to propel the growth of the 
economy by removing octroi and other forms of levies which 
hinder the free inter-state movement of goods, according to 
eminent economist, Dr Raja Chelliah. 
  These barriers prevent the establishment of a common market 
as well as hinder faster development, especially the backward 
states, he said. 
  The states must also change the mindset of its political 
leaders and bureaucrats, simplify procedures for approvals and 
inspections if they are to attract investment, essential for 
economic development, Dr Chelliah said at a seminar held here 
recently. 
  He said unless the backward states take steps to tone up 
their administration and end "licence raj" and "inspection raj," 
they are likely to lose more in the race for development. 
  Inaugurating the seminar, organised by the Centre for New 
Perspectives, Mr K.C. Pant, Chairman of the tenth finance 
commission, called for developing a consensus on the issue of 
non-plan expenditure of the Government.
