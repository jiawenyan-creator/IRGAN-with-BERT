  [Text] Belgrade, April 12 (AFP) -- The Moslem enclave of 
Gorazde, eastern Bosnia, was hit by seven shells early Tuesday 
morning, UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] spokeswoman 
Lyndall Sachs said in Belgrade. 
  The situation, however, was "relatively calm" after Monday's 
second air raid by NATO forces against Serb positions around the 
enclave, she said. Regular bursts of small arms fire could be 
heard, she added. 
  She was reporting information received from United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Gorazde. 
  Spokesman in Belgrade for Doctors Without Borders [Medecins 
sans Frontieres], Eric Stobbaerts, also said he had been told 
the situation in Gorazde was calm Tuesday morning, although 
isolated bursts of gunfire could be heard in the enclave. 
  He commented after speaking with the organisation's team of 
doctors in Gorazde. 
  "Overnight Monday, 34 more people were injured, four of whom 
died," Stobbaerts said. 
  Speaking in Sarajevo Tuesday, United Nations Protection 
Force 
(UNPROFOR) spokesman Major Rob Annink said the situation in 
Gorazde remained serious. 
  The Bosnian Serbs had "closed up to the River Drina" all 
along the southwest of the enclave Monday, he said, and were 
trying to push southward from the north, coming close to Bosnian 
Army positions. 
  Major Roy Thomas, senior military observer in Sarajevo, 
said, 
meanwhile, that UNPROFOR was trying, via contacts with the 
Bosnian Serb army, to gain contact with a Dutch military 
observer and his Serb interpreter who have been missing since 
they left the mainly Moslem encalve of Zepa, northeast of 
Gorazde, Monday morning. 
  The observer was on a routine administrative patrol, Thomas 
said. He and his interpreter passed through a Serb checkpoint 
out of Zepa and were last heard of at 9:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) 
Monday.
