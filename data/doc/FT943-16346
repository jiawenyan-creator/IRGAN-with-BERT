FT  05 JUL 94 / Arts: Today's Television
The passionate heretic who cries 'You fools] Why can't you see?' is a
fascinating and attractive figure. History shows that such people can be
right. Everyone from the Pope down insisted Galileo was wrong and godless,
literally a heretic, in backing the Copernican theory. Yet they were all
wrong and Galileo was right. It will be interesting to see how many of the
subjects of Heretic we end up believing. This new BBC2 series features six
men whose ideas have frightened others because they do not match established
patterns. (Goodness knows why they excluded the most glaring example, Peter
Duesberg, the main opponent of the HIV-Aids hypothesis. Surely not because
television has so much invested in the 'Equal fear for all' campaign?) The
first is Jacques Benveniste whose experiments appear to show that the theory
of homeopathy is right: the more you dilute a medicine, the more effective
it becomes (10.00). Documentaries about the Irish troubles are never
enjoyable, but during the years some have been striking. Creggan is one of
the best. Made in 1979 it is repeated by C4 in 'The Long War' season
(midnight).
