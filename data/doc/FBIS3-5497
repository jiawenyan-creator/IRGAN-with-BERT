  [Text] Nagasaki, March 8 KYODO -- The Maritime Safety 
Agency arrested 20 Vietnamese on Tuesday [8 March] on suspicion 
of illegally entering the country aboard a small wooden boat the 
previous day. 
  The agency did not arrest four children found on the boat, 
officials said. 
  The Vietnamese were discovered boarding a boat anchored off 
Ukujima Island in the Goto group of islands, part of Nagasaki 
Prefecture in western Japan. 
  This is the first application of a new rule adopted at an 
international conference on refugees from Indochina in Geneva 
last month. 
  Special regulations allowing boat people from Indochina 
temporary immigration permits pending screening of their 
applications for refugee status were abolished Saturday as a 
result of the conference. 
  Under the new system, people from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia 
who enter Japan without valid passports will be deported to 
their home countries without the option of seeking refugee 
status. 
  The boat left Haiphong with 10 people on board in October 
12, 
1993, and moved along the Chinese coast calling at ports where 
it was supplied with fuel and food, and picking up 14 more 
people on the way, agency officials said.
