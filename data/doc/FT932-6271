FT  28 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Brussels tries to resolve carbon steel
dispute
THE European Commission has taken further steps under the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade to resolve the dispute over US countervailing duties on
carbon steel products from the UK, France and Germany.
Commission officials said yesterday the EC had asked the Gatt subsidies
committee to look into duties which Brussels argues has artificially
inflated the level of alleged EC subsidies.
However, on a separate issue, a spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner
for external economic affairs, said yesterday, the EC would respond in kind
to the US sanctions in the government procurement dispute.
The duties cover lead and bismuth carbon steel products from Saarstahl of
Germany, Usinor Sacilor of France, and a joint venture to produce speciality
steel between British Steel and GKN, the UK engineering company. The duties
amount to around Dollars 19m (Pounds 12.3m) of business.
A Gatt panel decision is not expected until the autumn, but Commission
officials said they hoped the action under Gatt - rather than retaliation -
might have a positive influence in Washington.
