SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Research in Education of Individuals with Disabilities Program, authorized by Part E of the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 14411443), provides support: (1) To advance and improve the knowledge
base and improve the practice of professionals, parents, and others providing early intervention, special education,
and related services_including professionals in regular education environments_to provide children with disabilities
effective instruction and enable them to successfully learn; and (2) for research and related purposes, surveys
or demonstrations relating to physical education or recreation, including therapeutic recreation, for infants,
toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities.



On August 1, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed priorities for this program in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 3923239234).

These final priorities support the National Education Goals by improving understanding of how to enable children
and youth with disabilities to reach higher levels of academic achievement.

The publication of these priorities does not preclude the Secretary from proposing additional priorities, nor does
it limit the Secretary to funding only these priorities, subject to meeting applicable rulemaking requirements.
Funding of particular projects depends on the availability of funds, and the quality of the applications received.
Further, FY 1995 priorities could be affected by enactment of legislation reauthorizing these programs.






Note:

 This notice of final priorities does not solicit applications. A notice inviting applications under these competitions
is published in a separate notice in this issue of the 

Federal Register

.
