  [Text] The government has decided to militarize the 
nation's most important cities to control the destabilizing 
events that have intensified during the past few days. 
Education Minister Antonio Luis Cardenas, in his report, said 
leaders of these actions have established strong holds in high 
school buildings, using students as cannon fodder to disrupt 
public order. 
  The minister assured that the police officer who shot 
student 
German Sotillo during disturbances at the Fermin Toro school, 
had acted with premeditation. Sotillo died last week. After 
the police officer was arrested, a bullet of the same caliber 
used to kill the youngster, was found hidden inside one of his 
socks. Faced with this fact, the education minister asked: Who 
is behind this officer? Or did the hairy hand [mano 
peluda]--many times mentioned by the interior minister--pull the 
trigger. 
  The executive cabinet informs that a Military Intelligence 
Division Directorate report indicates there is a destabilizing 
plan that would be initiated through disturbances and would be 
instigated by--among others--hooded individuals. 
  [Begin Cardenas recording] We are discussing this today; it 
appears there is a destabilizing plan. The nation has to decide 
what we want to do. Do we want to keep the current government 
that is struggling against corruption, that is struggling for 
stability and is struggling to reorient this nation, or are we 
going to return to corruption and the disaster we had before? 
Or do we want a dictatorship? [end recording] 
  To conclude, Minister Antonio Luis Cardenas called on 
parents 
and student representatives to come out and defend the 
government-run high schools that are being used by subversives, 
while he urged the student not be deceived by those who are 
seeking the nation's destabilization.
