 

9. Any plate or orifice that is determined not to be in 
conformance with AGA standards shall be replaced with one that is 
in conformance. 


Violation:

 Major. 


Corrective Action:

 Replace orifice plate. 


Abatement Period:

 Prior to sales or removal. 
10. All connections and fittings of the secondary element 
(including meter pots and meter manifolds) shall be leak tested 
prior to conducting tests of the meter's accuracy. 


Violation:

 Minor. 


Corrective Action:

 Stop meter calibration and conduct leak 
test. 


Abatement Period:

 Prior to completion of calibration. 
11. Volumes of gas delivered shall be determined according to 
the flow equations specified in AGA Committee Report No. 3. 


Violation:

 Minor. 


Corrective Action:

 Recalculate all gas volumes not determined 
in accordance with flow equations specified in AGA Committee 
Report No. 3. Submit a report adjusting the volume of gas 
measured, and showing or discussing all calculations made in 
correcting the volumes. 


Abatement Period:

 60 days. 


D. Secondary Element 


The following are minimum standards for the secondary element 
of the orifice meter. 
1. Continuous temperature recorders to measure the flowing gas 
temperature are required on all sales and allocation meters 
measuring more than 100 Mcf per day on a monthly basis. Meters 
measuring 100 Mcf or less per day on a monthly basis shall 
determine the flowing temperature of the gas by one of the 
following: 
a. Continuous temperature recorder, or 
b. Average flowing temperature, as determined by a method 
approved by the authorized officer. 


Violation:

 Major. 


Corrective Action:

 Install temperature measuring device as 
required. 


Abatement Period:

 Prior to sales or removal. 
2. The temperature recording device shall be tested for 
accuracy utilizing one of the following: 
a. ``Test well'' in the meter run; or 
b. Water bath. 
Record ``as found'' readings, make any necessary adjustments, and 
record ``as left'' readings. 


Violation:

 Minor. 


Corrective Action:

 Test temperature recording device as 
specified, record ``as found'' readings, make necessary 
adjustments, and record ``as left'' readings. 


Abatement Period:

 Prior to completion of calibration. 
3. Differential and static pen accuracy shall be tested for 
linearity at zero, at 100 percent of the element range, and at 1 
point within the normal operating range of the differential and 
static recordings. Record ``as found'' readings, make any 
necessary adjustments, and record ``as left'' readings. 


Violation:

 Minor. 


Corrective Action:

 Test linearity at the required points, 
record ``as found'' readings, make necessary adjustments, and 
record ``as left'' readings. 


Abatement Period:

 Prior to completion of calibration. 
4. All calibrating equipment shall be more accurate than the 
required accuracy of the equipment being calibrated, as shown in 
the documentation required in paragraph 5. Calibration equipment 
shall be recertified at least annually.
