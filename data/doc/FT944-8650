FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Randgold focuses on mineral
rights
Randgold &amp; Exploration said its West African mineral rights were likely to
be grouped together and listed as a separate company in early 1995, Reuter
reports from Johannesburg. It also said it would consider a rights issue
early next year to refinance Durban Roodepoort Deep gold mine if current
talks on its possible merger with Rand Leases Gold Mining Co were concluded
successfully.
A number of proposals on the sale of Randgold's extensive mineral rights
were still being considered, Mr Peter Flack, the new executive chairman,
said after announcing poorer annual results.
He said the company's initial enthusiasm about the potential of Randgold's
minerals rights had actually increased. It seemed most likely that the West
African rights would be listed as a group in the first half of 1995.
Pre-tax profits slipped to R4.9m (Dollars 1.39m) for the year to
end-September from R15.9m a year ago, and to R3.7m from R8.3m at the net
level. The company passed its final dividend.
Mr Flack said Randgold had decided to take the full R12.6m costs of an
intended restructuring at its head office in the financial year to September
30 1994.
It had raised R40m for working capital at Durban Deeps gold mine and to fund
retrenchment packages.
