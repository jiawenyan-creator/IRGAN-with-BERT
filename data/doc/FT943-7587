FT  22 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up - Hong Kong
Regent Fund Management has warned of an impending property bubble in Hong
Kong, Reuter reports.
Mr Jim Mellon, managing director, said that Hong Kong was the main Asia
focus for foreign investors, outside Japan, but that it was significantly
overvalued, partly because 65 per cent of stock market earnings derived from
property investment.
'There is a massive shake-out coming, we are in the early stages of a 50 to
75 per cent fall over the next five years,' he said.
'But the warning signs were being muted by a lot of American latecomers to
the Hong Kong stock market.' Because of its dollar link, Hong Kong will also
see an exaggerated effect of tightening US monetary policy, in the same way
as it benefited from the easing over the past year.
He noted the Hong Kong stock market currently had the same market
capitalisation as Canada, or Italy, even though its economy and population
were smaller. He sees the Hang Seng index at 6,000 'in a year or so', from
9,480 now.
