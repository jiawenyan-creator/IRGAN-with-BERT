FT  05 OCT 93 / 'Wise men' expected to oppose Budget tax rises
A NARROW majority against tax rises in the November Budget is expected to
emerge from today's meeting of the Treasury's panel of outside economic
advisers.
The four panel members thought likely to oppose any further tax increases in
1994-95 on top of the Pounds 6.8bn already announced are Mr Andrew Britton
of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, Liverpool
University's Professor Patrick Minford, Mr Andrew Sentance of the
Confederation of British Industry and Professor Wynne Godley, formerly of
Cambridge University.
Prof Godley, who is in the US, will not attend the meeting but will send his
views by fax.
The other three members of the panel - Professor Tim Congdon of Lombard
Street Research, London Business School's Professor David Currie and Mr
Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs - have expressed a preference for further tax
increases to curb growing public borrowing.
The panel is divided about the need for cuts in interest rates, with
supporters of higher taxes on the whole wanting a relaxation in monetary
policy. Of those wanting no change in tax policy, Prof Minford favours
urgent cuts in bank base rates. The group will talk to Mr Alan Budd, the
Treasury's chief economic adviser, again next Tuesday.
