FT  22 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: European volume figures
EUROPEAN volume figures for November reveal a general decline in activity,
with the exception of Italy which continued a trend that began the month
before. However, while turnover there jumped by more than 41 per cent, most
of it came from domestic investors, says Mr James Cornish at County NatWest
Securities, which collates the data. By contrast, the Netherlands showed the
biggest fall, of some 16 per cent.
