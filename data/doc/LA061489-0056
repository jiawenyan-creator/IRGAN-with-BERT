2 MORE CHINESE DIPLOMATS REPORTEDLY MAY DEFECT 
Two more diplomats attached to the Chinese Consulate here may be considering 
asking for political asylum because they don't want to inform on Chinese 
students, according to a report in today's editions of the San Francisco 
Chronicle. 
The pair, a husband and wife who work in the consulate's education section, are 
staying with friends in the Bay Area, despite being due back in Beijing this 
week, the paper reported. 
Quoting sources close to the couple, who were not identified, the paper said 
the diplomats had been expected to inform on Chinese exchange students 
protesting here over the June 4 massacre of demonstrators in Tian An Men 
Square. 
"They don't want to provide a blacklist," said a friend of the couple who was 
identified only as a student leader at Stanford University. 
Wang Shaohua, a spokesman for the consulate, denied that the couple might be 
considering defection. He said they left the consulate last week to "live in a 
friend's home" for "some time." He added that their move was "quite a bit 
unusual" because the travel of Communist consular officials in the United 
States is restricted. 
Two other Chinese diplomats from the consulate sought FBI protection Saturday 
night after announcing at a City Hall rally that they planned to defect because 
of the Beijing government's propaganda campaign, which claims no students were 
killed in the crackdown on the country's pro-democracy movement. 
Zhou Liming, 26, vice consul for cultural affairs, and Zhang Limin, 25, vice 
consul for overseas affairs, told the FBI that they wanted to seek political 
asylum in the United States. They have since gone into hiding and are 
reportedly reconsidering their actions. 
A spokesman said Tuesday night that the FBI had not been contacted by any other 
diplomats seeking asylum.
