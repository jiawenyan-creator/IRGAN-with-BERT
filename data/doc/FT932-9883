FT  12 MAY 93 / Life through the eyes of Asil Nadir
'My supporters will be able to handle any situation and nobody will be
hardshipped,' he said when asked what he planned to do about those who had
to surrender his bail
'I'm waiting to be accused of the Chernobyl disaster and the famines in
Sudan and Ethiopia. The last thing I saw in the Turkish papers was that I
was the main person in the Irangate affair. It is exactly like the regu-
latory authorities in Britain - the more difficulty they get into the more
ridiculous the accusations become'
'When the Turkish government tries to help a British public company there
should only be gratitude not a threatening telex from the Foreign Office'
'The difference between myself and the administrators is that I am still
innocent until proven
guilty and they have been found guilty of gross professional misconduct. I
leave you to judge whose word should be taken'
'You know confidence in a business is everything. When confidence is removed
at a strike by malicious behaviour, how can the companies operate. The mere
fact that every one of my companies survived and stayed alive is a credit to
them'
