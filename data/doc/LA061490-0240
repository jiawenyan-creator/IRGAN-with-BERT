SHORT TAKES; 
NICOLE GOES CRUISIN' IN SILENCE 
She's gone from co-star to girlfriend, but actress Nicole Kidman isn't kissing 
and telling about beau Tom Cruise. 
Kidman co-stars in Cruise's "Days of Thunder," a soon-to-be released 
auto-racing drama, and attended this year's Oscars ceremonies with him in the 
wake of his marital split with actress Mimi Rogers. 
But the Australian-born actress isn't boasting about her relationship with the 
star of "Rain Man," who was nominated for best actor in "Born on the Fourth of 
July." 
"There's nothing more to say except, yeah, we're together," the actress tells 
Rolling Stone in its July 12 issue.
