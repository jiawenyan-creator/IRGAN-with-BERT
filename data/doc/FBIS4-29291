  [Text] The Republic of Singapore Navy [RSN] is for the 
first time arming its ships with an air defense role. The RSN's 
six missile gunboats, MGB's, and support ships will be fitted 
with surface-to-air missiles. Acquired from France, the 
missiles will replace the Bofors anti-aircraft guns on the MGB's 
by next year. Second Defense Minister Dr. Lee Boon Yang 
described the upgrading exercise as practical. He said the 
introduction of improved technology like the Mistral missiles 
allows for the best use of RSN investment over the years. Dr. 
Lee was speaking at Brani Naval Base this morning when he 
visited the 185 Squadron.
