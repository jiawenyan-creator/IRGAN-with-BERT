CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SAN DIEGO; 
SAILOR WHO INFECTED WOMAN CONVICTED 
A 28-year-old sailor was convicted of aggravated assault in military court for 
failing to tell a former Navy woman with whom he had sex that he was a carrier 
of the AIDS-causing virus. Petty Officer John Joseph was sentenced to 30 months 
in jail, forfeiture of pay and a dishonorable discharge after infecting the 
woman. 
Because of a pretrial agreement, however, Joseph will serve no more than a year 
in jail. In testimony, military doctors discussed whether Joseph could have 
infected the woman when both adults acknowledged that he did not ejaculate. It 
is not yet known whether pre-ejaculate fluid contains the human 
immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. The woman claimed that they used a 
condom and that it broke. Joseph said the condom did not break.
