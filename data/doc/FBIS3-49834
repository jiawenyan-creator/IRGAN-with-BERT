<F P=106> [Report by Djordje Gajdosevic from Baranja] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Gajdosevic] Milan Martic, candidate for 
president of the republic of Serbian Krajina, visited Baranja 
today. He was warmly welcomed in Darda, Beli Manastir, and 
Knezevi Vinogradi. His statement that he would do his best to 
keep his mandate as short as possible, and that he would hand 
over his presidential function to Slobodan Milosevic, were 
greeted here with long applause. 
  [Begin Martic recording] I have never concealed the fact 
that I am committed to this course, that is, that I am carrying 
out the program drafted by our pan-Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic. Despite attacks by some malicious people saying that 
I am a puppet of that great president of ours, I can openly say 
that I am nobody's puppet, but I am very well acquainted with 
the program of President Milosevic and his associates, and the 
program of Dr. Radovan Karadzic and his associates, which are 
absolutely identical. [end recording] 
  [Gajdosevic] By stressing that Serbia was behind him, FRY 
[Sports] Minister Zoran Bingulac supported the candidacy of 
Milan Martic, as did Radovan Pankov [chairman of the Socialist 
Party of Serbia for Vojvodina], and Brana Crncevic and Ljuba 
Novakovic [Socialist Party of Serbia deputies in the Serbian 
Assembly]. [passage omitted]
