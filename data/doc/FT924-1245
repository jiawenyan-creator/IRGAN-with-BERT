FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Too strong a dose of medicine - Paul
Abrahams on tough new DoH proposals
THE ASSOCIATION of the British Pharmaceutical Industry will today request
the Department of Health to abandon proposals to extend blacklists of
products for which the National Health Service will not pay.
The surprise proposals, announced last month by the Department of Health,
could cost drugs groups up to 70 per cent of their National Health Service
turnover, according to figures compiled by the Financial Times.
The 10 therapeutic areas on the new blacklists include anti-diarrhoeals,
hypnotics and anxiolytics, appetite suppressants, contraceptives, topical
anti-rheumatics, as well as treatments for allergic disorders, vaginal and
vulval conditions, anaemia, ear and nose illnesses and skin diseases.
Full details of the individual drugs to be blacklisted are only likely to be
revealed in April.
However, the sector as a whole could lose sales of up to Pounds 450m,
jeopardising 5,000 jobs and Pounds 400m in capital investment, according to
the ABPI.
The drugs will still be available on private prescription instead of the
NHS, but this means additional costs to the patient, according to PA
Consulting, the management consultants.
Some of the drugs, but not all, could be marketed over the counter at
pharmacies without prescription.
Although, Glaxo, the UK's biggest drugs group, is most affected in absolute
terms - it could lose about Pounds 39m in sales - some UK subsidiaries of
non-British groups are proportionally likely to be far worse hit.
Stiefel, based in High Wycombe, could lose up to 75 per cent of NHS sales if
its skin treatments are included on the blacklists. The UK subsidiary of US
group Schering-Plough could lose 70 per cent of its sales.
Schering of Germany's British arm could experience a 37 per cent drop in
revenues if its three oral contraceptives, Femodeen, Logynon and Microgynon
are included on the list. However, the company believes is unlikely.
Marion Merrell Dow of the US could lose Pounds 16m if its NHS turnover of
its anti-histamine Triludan is included. The group is partly protected
because the product is already sold over the counter without a prescription.
About 625 products are affected. Other well-known products include Glaxo's
eczema treatment Betnovate, Bayer's anti-fungal Canestan, Wellcome's
decongestant Sudafed, Pfizer's anti-rheumatic Feldene and Wyeth's Beconase.
Mr Mike Wallace, managing director at Schering Healthcare, says: 'Whether in
the UK, the US or on the Continent, there is clearly a need for more
resources in healthcare. If they cannot come from tax revenues, then the
money must come from patients. Admittedly, any change in financing is
inevitably political. There must be some form of safety net for those
without resources.'
The industry would even be willing to negotiate price freezes or a reduction
on the return of capital employed governed by the Pharmaceutical Price
Regulation Scheme, the agreement that sets UK drugs prices, says Mr Peter
Martin, director of marketing at Schering-Plough.
The ABPI says the future development of medicines could be hit by the
black-lists.
It points out that since seven therapeutic categories were blacklisted in
1985, only three products have been granted licences in those areas. Drugs
groups see little point going to the expense of developing products that
will not generate NHS sales.
'The government's approach could cause a rethink about decisions to invest
in the UK,' says Mr David Alcroft at PA Consulting.
