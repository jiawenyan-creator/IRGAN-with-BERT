EX-CUBS PITCHER VERN OLSEN DIES 
Vern (Lefty) Olsen, a former pitcher for the Chicago Cubs, died Thursday at 71 
in Loyola University Medical Center in suburban Maywood. The cause of death was 
not disclosed. 
Olsen pitched for the Cubs from 1939 to 1942 and again in 1946 after serving 
three years in the Navy. He missed the 1945 season when the Cubs won the 
National League pennant. 
The native of Hillsboro, Ore., was 13-9 in 1940 and 10-8 the next year. 
A sore arm ended his baseball career. He had a lifetime record of 30-26, with 
an ERA of 3.40 and seven shutouts in 60 starts.
