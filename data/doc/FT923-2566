FT  17 SEP 92 / International Company News: Seven face SEC insider trading
charges
THE SECURITIES and Exchange Commission said yesterday it had charged seven
people with insider trading violations in connection with the 1988 takeover
of US food group Pillsbury by Grand Metropolitan, the UK food and drinks
group, agencies report from Washington.
In a civil complaint filed in a Manhattan federal court, the SEC alleged
that the defendants made more than Dollars 750,000 in illegal profits by
trading in Pillsbury stock before Grand Met's Dollars 60-a-share tender
offer was announced.
The SEC is seeking an order requiring the return of those profits, civil
penalties and injunctions against future violations.
According to the SEC's complaint, Mrs Theresa Billings Falbo, then a
secretary to a senior Grand Met executive involved in planning the tender
offer, told her husband Mr Robert Falbo about the deal.
Mr Falbo, who was then an electrician at Grand Met, bought Pillsbury shares
not only for himself but under the names of two other defendants, Mr Lorre
Meade and Mr Antony Capricuso.
The SEC said Mr Falbo or Mr Capricuso, or both, tipped off the three other
defendants, who also traded in Pillsbury securities.
The defendants sold their shares after Grand Met announced its offer on
October 4 1988, the SEC said. On that day, Pillsbury common stock closed at
Dollars 57.50 a share, up from Dollars 39.125 the previous day.
The SEC is continuing its investigation.
Mr Falbo's lawyer had no comment, while Mr Capricuso's lawyer said his
client would vigorously contest the charges.
