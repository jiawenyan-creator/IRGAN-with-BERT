  [Text] In the ULSI multi interlayer wiring process, it has 
been realized again that leveling the interlayer insulating film 
is an important aspect of the technology. Traditionally, in 
exposure of wiring pattern on insulation film, level differences 
occur making it necessary to estimate the focus depth. Or in 
some situations, highly complicated techniques such as phase 
shift or the grazing incidence method were necessary. Leveling 
the interlayer insulating film was allowing some margin in 
achieving the goals of exposure technology. 
  For leveling the interlayer insulating film, several 
technologies such as automatic CVD leveling or CVD leveling by 
bias ECR used in TEOS-O[.sub]3[/] have been suggested and 
used actively. However, none of the technologies has yet come up 
with the complete leveling which can interface with high 
precision and integration. This is because the technology in CVD 
and etching do not principally have the capability of 
controlling the formation in a direction perpendicular to a 
convex and recessed surface. On the other hand the mechanical 
grinding discussed here has a possibility of easily realizing 
complete surface leveling. The principle is simply based on the 
selective polishing of the convex area, since efficiency of 
polishing depends on the contact pressure with grinding granules 
and contact time, that is, the selection ratio with a recessed 
area is quite high. Grinding technology for insulating films is 
not only applied to the interlayer, but also applied for element 
separation in poly-Si deposition, contact, bare hole, and metal 
film grinding in LSI processing. However, LSI process technology 
is dry, and it is based on low particle density technology. Thus 
there is a problem of employing technology used for wet grinding 
with fine granules. Also since the grinding is not for simple 
leveling traditionally practiced in Si baseboard, there are 
practical problems that occur in grinding the convex and 
recessed surface with several kinds of patterns. In this report, 
a grinding pad that will solve the problem that occurs in 
leveling the interlayer insulating film, and practical examples 
of grinding equipment are discussed. 
<H5>  High Precision Grinding Technology For Leveling Interlayer </H5>
Insulating Film 
  1. Grinding Pad 
  In early LSI production, grinding for leveling the 
interlayer 
has used a pad with abrasive material, and equipment that was 
used with traditional Si baseboards. In order to avoid defects 
or scratches in grinding the Si crystal baseboard, a soft pad 
was used. If this method is applied to an interlayer film with 
recessed and convex areas, the pad is pressed with pressure, so 
that the recessed area as well as the convex area which is the 
necessary part to grind are affected. Therefore leveling is not 
achieved effectively as seen in figure 1. In order to achieve 
leveling effectively, some thickness of insulating film on metal 
wiring must be secured. The initial film thickness is quite 
large, and grinding takes considerable time. On the other hand, 
if a harder pad is used, as seen in figure 2, because selective 
grinding of the convex area rather than the recessed area is 
emphasized, then because of the difference in Si baseboard curve 
and the thickness of the baseboard, the interlayer insulating 
film after grinding is not consistent, and the wiring pattern 
will be partially exposed. From these observations, it became 
apparent that uniform grinding must be based on the curved area 
and thickness of the Si baseboard, that is, the surface to 
receive the grinding. Figure 3 shows a high performance pad 
configuration that will be required for grinding. The small 
divided area is a hard resin, and each small area is supported 
by a flexible body, and high performance can be obtained.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-56A>      Figure 3. Grinding By The Suggested New Pad </FIG>


  In order to reduce the inconsistent and ineffective grinding 
by abrasive material, it is important that good consistency 
should be achieved by the exchange of pads, not by a complex 
technique. 
  2. Abrasive Material 
  The reason why the CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) is 
used in naming the grinding of interlayer insulating film of 
SiO[.sub]2[/] is not clear. However, in the grinding of 
ECR-CVD film which is very close to heat oxide film in quality, 
it has been found that by changing the grinding fluid to pH 
7-11, grinding performance is doubled as seen in figure 4. Since 
the film surface will not change even when the film is dipped in 
pH 11 mild alkaline fluid for long time, it is apparent that the 
combined effect of chemistry and machinery will have some impact 
on the grinding mechanism. Basically, SiO[.sub]2[/] group 
film becomes quite active for bonding to OH baseboard when 
pressure and temperature are increased, and it resolves well 
with water. There is another conceivable method in which the 
surface that is activated by machine with fine granules is 
bonded with the OH baseboard producing a surface with different 
characteristics that will be ground mechanically with abrasive 
material. Also, mutual reaction of both abrasive material and 
grinding surface can be considered. Especially since some 
granules such as CeO[.sub]2[/] have high performance in 
grinding, and it is projected that strong bonding with the 
surface granules of interlayer of CeO[.sub]2[/] and 
SiO[.sub]2[/] exists. Therefore bonding between granule 
material and surface characteristics will contribute to the 
efficiency of grinding. But also it is necessary to consider 
that cleaning after grinding in this process will become quite 
difficult. For abrasive material, in order not to cause 
mechanical damage, a soft material equivalent to that of the 
interlayer insulation film, consistent in granule diameter, with 
good dispersion in mild alkaline solution, and low metal 
impurity content is desired.

  3. Grinding Equipment 
  Even when a pad which is suitable for leveling of the 
interlayer and overall leveling of the Si baseboard is used, 
unless the equipment can perform with consistency and can grind 
with high throughput, as a manufacturing technology, it is 
meaningless. Figure 5 shows equipment for a single piece 
operation, and figure 6 shows equipment for a batch operation. 
Both models are different from the regular grinding base which 
is usually installed in the lower part, and supports the Si 
baseboard in the upper part. The base unit for grinding is 
installed at a precision rotating table, at the side of the Si 
base support, avoiding the grinding base (pad) which enables set 
up conditions to be easily changed. Although it is 
disadvantageous to supply abrasive material on the grinding 
surface, it reduced the occurrence of grinding granules stacked 
and filled in the surface of pad. Also, since the surface of the 
Si baseboard is upward, and the supporting table is high 
precision, it makes it advantageous to determine the end point 
after completion of grinding. Figure 6 shows the batch model 
which can process 5 baseboards at one time. While the small 
tables supporting the Si baseboards are rotated, the large table 
by the rotation of each small table is made to rotate. For this 
reason, the average efficiency for processing 5 baseboards which 
move in relation to the positions in the grinding equipment and 
grinding base, is quite high. And within batch processing and 
between batch processing are maintained quite uniformly. Also 
the table for Si baseboards is installed with high precision and 
durability, so that the grinding operation is stable even with 
high rotation and high load and it can be expected to have good 
leveling throughput.

  4. Examples of Grinding Leveling Interlayer Insulating 
Film 
  Examples of grinding are demonstrated here by using the 
grinding pad shown in figure 3 and the equipment shown in figure 
5. The pattern is made for this example, and on 3-100 m Al 
wiring, with ECR-CVD, and a1.8 m SiO[.sub]2[/] film is 
formed. With bias CVD by ECR it is possible to deposit in a 
narrow space and in fine wiring lines, as shown in figure 7. At 
the time of CVD, good leveling is achieved and only a triangular 
convex region is left. Figure 8 shows an example of leveling the 
insulating film with a pattern: (a) is the example of hard and 
soft layers of grinding pad. In the region of wiring width of 3 
m, grinding progresses quite faster than with a 100 m 
wide 
pattern, and the Al wiring part is exposed when a wide area is 
ground to a certain level of thickness of the interlayer 
insulating film. On the other hand (b) is the example of 
grinding in the image of figure 3. Level differences for both is 
less than 0.05 m and leveling is achieved without any 
dependence on pattern density.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-58A>      Figure 8. Pattern Formation After Grinding </FIG>


  On the other hand figure 9 is the result of measurement 
along 
four lines of formation before and after grinding the Si 
baseboard. Although the overall baseboard has 5-6 m size 
large convex and recessed areas, about 1 m grinding amount 
is 
obtained in all directions, and it shows that the pad in figure 
3 is effective in realizing leveling of both the convex and 
recessed areas, and global leveling (uniform leveling in overall 
baseboard) is achieved.

  In grinding by the batch method (5 pieces) in figure 6, 
after 
0.5 m grinding, between batches, film thickness distribution 
is +/- 3%, and batch distribution is +/- 5%. 
  Cleaning after grinding the baseboard is important since it 
will influence the decision to employ a leveling grinding 
process. In the mass production type grinding equipment shown in 
figure 6, a scrubber is attached which can clean 5 pieces right 
after the grinding, and unloaded wet pieces are transferred to 
the connected cleaning equipment. The dedicated cleaning 
equipment includes a mega-sonic shower operated at both sides 
simultaneously, a scrubber operated at both sides 
simultaneously, a front and back separate scrubbing shower, and 
a drying station. Over 0.2 m particles are realized with 
less 
than 20 pieces within the baseboard. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  For the technology of leveling the multiple interlayer 
insulating film in LSIs, developed examples including pads for 
the grinding operation, abrasive materials, and grinding 
equipment, which are not dependent on the inconsistent pattern 
or size, large or small, enable the entire surface to be 
leveled. A unique configuration and method are employed 
considering the formation and material that are different from 
the traditional Si crystal baseboard. The objective is about to 
be realized. Furthermore, responding to the suggestions of new 
device organizations and processes, higher precision and higher 
performance are our goals.
