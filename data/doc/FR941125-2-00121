Action: 

Notice is hereby given that the Judith-Valley-Phillips Resource Management Plan will be amended by the Judith Resource

</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will amend the Judith-Valley-Phillips Resource Management Plan (RMP) with respect
to management of public lands in the North Moccasin Mountains. The BLM proposes exchanging 150.52 acres of Federal
surface estate for 129.24 acres of private land. The Federal land is legally described as Lots 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 13, and 14
Section 29, Lots 8, 9, 16, 18, 19, 23, and 25 Section 31, and Lots 2, 3, and 4 Section 32, T. 18 N., R. 18 E., P.M.M., Fergus
County, Montana. The private land is legally described as MS 6366, MS 6727, MS 6728, MS 8470, MS 8471, MS 8472, MS 8473,
and MS 8474, T. 18 N., R. 18 E., P.M.M., Fergus County, Montana. 



Disposal of the Federal lands was not analyzed in the Judith-Valley-Phillips Resource Management Plan (RMP) and
associated Environmental Impact Statement. Disposal of Federal land requires that the specific tract be identified
in the land use plan with the criteria to be met for exchange and discussion of how the criteria have been satisfied.
This will be part of the plan amendment and environmental assessment. The Judith Resource Area, Lewistown District,
Bureau of Land Management will prepare an environmental assessment to analyze the effects of disposal.
