FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: Gieves placing and open offer to
raise Pounds 1.8m
HAVING BREACHED covenants on convertible loan stock and borrowing
restrictions, Gieves Group is raising Pounds 1.8m net in a placing and open
offer to remedy the situation.
The group, now operating as retailers and licensors and publishers, is
placing 8.2m shares with USI Holdings group, which speaks for 5.1 per cent
of the capital and all of the loan stock, and with Thistle Nominees on
behalf of Mr George Ljutikov, a private investor holding 9.9 per cent of the
capital.
Shareholders can claw back on the basis of 3-for-5 at 25p per share. USI
will not request the immediate repayment of the loan stock in return for
certain adjustments to the terms.
At the end of the year to January 31 1993 the loss retained in the business
had risen from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 4.75m. For the 12 months pre-tax
deficit came to Pounds 1.41m (Pounds 1.51m), including exceptional charges
of Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 1.71m).
The exceptionals were made up of Pounds 810,000 for the closure of the
Gieves &amp; Hawkes operation in Milan and two retail outlets in the UK, Pounds
471,000 for restructuring and reorganisation costs for Chivers' publishing
divisions in the UK and US, and Pounds 63,000 for net property liabilities.
On top of that were extraordinary charges of Pounds 3.47m (Pounds 2.28m).
These comprised Pounds 1.78m adjustment for goodwill previously written off
against reserves, Pounds 998,000 provisions and asset write-offs principally
for the Milan stores, Pounds 815,000 profit on the sale of Bookpoint, and
Pounds 1.5m in respect of the crystallisation of contingent liabilities
relating to Redwood Press.
In respect of the latter, the principal guaranteed parties have
conditionally agreed to subscribe for 900,000 shares at 25p in part
settlement of the amounts owed.
