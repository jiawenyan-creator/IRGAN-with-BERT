FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T to take charge against 1993
earnings
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph said yesterday that it would take a non-cash,
after tax charge of some Dollars 1.3bn against 1993 earnings because of a
change in the accounting treatment of certain benefits to employees after
they leave the company.
However, it said that, excluding this charge and costs for a previously
announced restructuring programme at its computer subsidiary NCR,
fourth-quarter net income was expected to be about Dollars 1.15bn, or 85
cents a share, in line with analysts' estimates.
The accounting change, which all companies must adopt by the fiscal first
quarter of 1994, means separation payments must be expensed as they
accumulate over employees' working lives, rather than booked as they are
identified. Also, disability payments have to be expensed when the
disability occurs, rather than when payments are made.
