FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Building Society ahead 20%
Yorkshire Building Society, the UK's 12th largest, announced pre-tax profits
of Pounds 66.8m for 1993, an increase of 20 per cent, writes Alison Smith.
Net mortgage lending was down slightly at Pounds 850m (Pounds 873m),
reflecting competition societies have been facing from banks in this area.
Net retail receipts rose steeply, from Pounds 121m to Pounds 223m.
Total assets rose to Pounds 5.3bn (Pounds 4.8bn).
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts and liabilities fell 20 per cent to
Pounds 18.4m (Pounds 22.9m). This is not as sharp a fall as that recorded by
some other leading societies, but Yorkshire said this was partly
attributable to the way in which house prices had moved in the north of
England, as against the UK as a whole.
The cost/income ratio fell from 39.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent.
Mr Derek Roberts, chief executive, said that 1994 was 'unlikely to herald a
significant recovery in the core savings and mortgage markets' but the
consistency of Yorkshire's performance had enabled it to reduce operating
margins.
