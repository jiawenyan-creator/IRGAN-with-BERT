FT  21 MAR 94 / Sarajevans show UN their skills on the field
Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, commander of UN troops in Bosnia,
shakes hands with a Sarajevan football supporter, after the city's home team
yesterday beat a UN scratch side 4-0.
Around 20,000 people watched Football Club Sarajevo's tri-umph, the largest
crowd to gather in the city since war broke out nearly two years ago.
Following the game, and entertainment provided by sky-divers, Nato warplanes
and the British Coldstream Guards military band, Gen Rose cited the day's
events as proof that the peace process in Bosnia was 'irreversible'. He had
organised the match as a non-political event.
A ceasefire between Moslem troops defending the city and besieging Serbs has
been holding for nearly six weeks.
