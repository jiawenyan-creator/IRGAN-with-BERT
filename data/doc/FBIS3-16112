  [Text] Zagreb March 12 TASS -- Special envoy of the Russian 
president Vitaliy Churkin arrived here today to discuss with 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman the situation in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and relations between Zagreb and Belgrade. 
  Commenting on the current Croatian-Serb relations at the 
Zagreb Airport, Churkin told ITAR-TASS "they are not as smooth 
as they could be. I will do my best to achieve any progress". 
  He said there are considerable obstacles on the way of 
post-Yugoslav settlement, but the sides must find a possibility 
to progress. 
  The London meeting with special envoy of the U.S. President 
on Bosnia Charles Redman on Friday resulted in mutual 
understanding and readiness for the most close cooperation in 
the conflict settlement, said Churkin. 
  On Sunday the official will meet leaders of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and Bosnian Serbs in Sarajevo and on Monday he will 
leave for Belgrade.
