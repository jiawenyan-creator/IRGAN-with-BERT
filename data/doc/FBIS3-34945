  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Western diplomatic 
sources in Amman announced yesterday that the French Government 
has rejected the Iraqi Government's request to grant Lieutenant 
General Husayn Kamil Hasan al-Majid, son-in-law of Iraqi 
President Saddam Husayn, an entry visa to France. Paris 
attributed this to political and security reasons. Meanwhile 
other reports said that Lt. Gen. al-Majid underwent brain 
surgery in the al-Husayn Medical Center in Amman. Iraqis in 
Amman said that the Iraqi president's son-in-law and cousin went 
into a coma and was partially paralyzed last week. Urgent 
medical tests were conducted and he was immediately moved to 
Amman to be treated by Jordanian doctors. Attempts were made for 
five days to cure him but all failed and the deep coma 
continued. As a result, doctors had to operate on him the day 
before yesterday to remove a brain tumor. The Iraqi president's 
son-in-law is accompanied by a large security team which has 
been joined by the Iraqi ambassador to Amman and a number of his 
aides in the Industry Ministry and the Military 
Industrialization Organization, which al-Majid heads. 
  Lt. Gen. al-Majid is a special adviser to the Iraqi 
president 
with the rank of minister. He was appointed defense minister in 
1991. He has been chairman of the Military Industrialization 
Organization since 5 September 1993. He has been in charge of 
the Military Industrialization Organization and is considered 
responsible for the programs for the chemical, bacterial, 
nuclear, and missile weapons the United Nations is dismantling.
