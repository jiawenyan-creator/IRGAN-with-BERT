  [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- The Ministry of 
Agriculture has allocated 65,600 tons of chemical fertilizer and 
20,000 tons of fuel for farm machinery to flooded areas in 
southern China as part of its efforts to help them recover from 
the disaster, sources from the ministry said here today. 
  About 3.86 million ha of crops had been hit by the 
disastrous 
floods since early June, with south China's Guangdong Province 
the worst affected. 
  The ministry said that about 660,000 ha of crops in 
Guangdong 
province, one of the richest regions in China, was affected by 
the floods. 
  Guangdong Province was followed by the provinces of Jiangxi 
and Hunan, with 600,000 ha of flooded crops. 
  The other provinces were east China's Zhejiang, Anhui and 
Fujian, and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. 
  While the southern part of China has been hit by rainstorms 
and floods, about 19 million ha of crop in nearly ten provinces 
or regions in the northern China are suffering from continuous 
drought, an increase of about 11.1 million ha over last month. 
  About 17.6 million people and 27.81 million head of 
livestock 
have problems with drinking water because of the prolonged dry 
spells, the minister said. 
  The drought-hit regions include the provinces of Shandong, 
Hebei and Shanxi and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. 
  The ministry is also offering the disaster-hit regions 
advices on how to minimize the effects on agricultural 
production, such as growing more crops that needs shorter growth 
period in the flooded southern regions and more acreage for late 
rice in double-cropping rice regions. 
  Moreover, the flooded areas should pay more attention to 
possible droughts which often come after floods, and worsening 
plant diseases, particularly the prevention and control of 
diseases affecting rice, cotton, corn and soybeans, the ministry 
cautioned.
