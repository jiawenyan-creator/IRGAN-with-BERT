FT  04 NOV 92 / Further fall reported in house prices
HOUSE PRICES fell on average by 2.7 per cent last month, the biggest monthly
fall for two years, Nationwide Building Society said yesterday.
The drop is likely to increase pressure on the government to come up with
ways to help the housing market in the Autumn Statement on November 12.
It is the fifth successive monthly fall and follows September's 1.4 per cent
decline. The Halifax Building Society house price index, based on a larger
survey, showed a fall of 3.1 per cent in September, but the month was
considered atypical because of the ending of stamp duty relief in August.
Nationwide said: 'The cut-off date for our month is a few days earlier than
the Halifax's so we may be reflecting this month what we missed last month.'
The Halifax house price index will be issued later this week.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide, attributed the fall to
the ending of stamp duty relief and economic uncertainty.
He said: 'Two significant events affected the housing market in the latter
half of September - the end of the stamp duty holiday for house buyers and
the interest rate volatility around the time of the UK's withdrawal from the
exchange rate mechanism.
'The uncertainty caused by these events has continued into October. In
addition, uncertainty about the general economy and employment prospects
continues to dampen the confidence of potential house buyers.'
The figure is disappointing as house-buying normally picks up by October. Mr
Bob Pannell of the Council of Mortgage Lenders said activity was usually
robust in October.
The drop brought the average house price down by Pounds 1,491 from the
previous month to Pounds 53,038 according to Nationwide's house price index.
House prices in October were 6.6 per cent lower than in the same month last
year.
