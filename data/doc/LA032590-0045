TEEN-AGE SUICIDE 
Having taken my children to see "Dead Poets Society," up for four Academy 
Awards, including best picture, I was angered by the film makers' failure to 
address the film's central issue -- teen-age suicide. 
Momentarily thwarted by his father's attempt to dominate his life, one of Robin 
Williams' most promising students shoots himself, a believable adolescent act 
of revenge. 
But who loses the most? Clearly the boy himself. 
Yet, the film makers choose to make Williams' personal loss of his teaching 
position the central story point. Is this responsible film making? 
On the way home from the theater, it was clear from their conversation that my 
kids loved the film. When I asked my 11-year-old if he thought the boy was 
right in what he did, he said yes. After all, what choice did the boy have? His 
father was destroying his life. 
Fortunately, this gave me an opportunity to point out that no matter how much 
we may disagree, suicide is not the answer. But how many children will see this 
picture and never have similar discussion with their parents?
