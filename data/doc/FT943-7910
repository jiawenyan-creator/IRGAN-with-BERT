FT  20 AUG 94 / Mandela rejects Lesotho force
Leaders in South Africa and Zimbabwe yesterday rejected military
intervention in Lesotho, where the king has claimed control over the elected
government, Reuter reports from Cape Town.
Presidents Nelson Mandela of South Africa and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe said
they would first pursue diplomatic efforts to end the crisis in the small
mountain state of 1.8m people, which is entirely surrounded by South Africa.
The military option 'was discussed, but we decided we should concentrate on
peaceful methods to try to resolve the situation,' Mr Mandela said.
His remarks were echoed by Mr Mugabe, who wanted 'the people of that country
being brought to a conference table to discuss their differences'.
An appointed provisional government was yesterday sworn in to rule Lesotho
in place of the democratically elected parliament dissolved by the king, and
one man was reported killed when police fired on demonstrators.
Mr Mandela said he was particularly concerned that the conflict in the
former British colony might spill over into South Africa, where many Lesotho
residents have relatives.
King Letsie III issued a proclamation on Wednesday dissolving parliament and
the cabinet of Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle, whose election in 1993 ended
seven years of military rule. The monarch apparently plans to hand the
country back to his father, deposed in a military coup in 1990.
