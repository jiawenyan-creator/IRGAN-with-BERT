FT  07 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Brazilian equities up 3.9 per cent
BRAZILIAN shares finished 3.9 per cent higher following light trading as
investors continued to buy telecom, utility and steel sectors.
The Bovespa index moved ahead 440 to 11,618.
State power utilities were strong on hopes that the sector will be the next
one to be privatised. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the economy minister,
said in a recent interview that he would announce changes to the
privatisation programme later this month. Analysts expect the minister to
include the government's outstanding social security debts as a means of
payment in the privatisation auctions.
Mr Cardoso has also said that he is planning to accept outstanding debt owed
by the federal government to the electrical firms (CRC) in the privatisation
auctions of the sector.
