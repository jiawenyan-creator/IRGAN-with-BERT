WORLD; 
ALBANIA OKS ELECTION REFORM 
Albania's Communist parliament passed an election law allowing secret ballots 
and a choice of candidates and ordered a sweeping revision of the constitution, 
the official ATA news agency said today. 
It said both issues were approved unanimously at a meeting of the People's 
Assembly in the capital, Tirana, on Tuesday. 
The decisions mark a further step on a cautious road to reform in Albania, 
Europe's last orthodox Communist state. They were adopted a week before a 
summit meeting in Paris of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(CSCE), at which Tirana is bidding for full membership. 
The new election law, aimed at elections to the People's Assembly next 
February, stops short of legalizing opposition political parties.
