FT  29 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Program purchases lift Dow to
record
Wall Street
A LATE round of program buying helped Wall Street set a new record yesterday
afternoon, in spite of a strong sell-off in airline issues, and in cellular
telephone stocks following news of a stock-swap merger between Sprint and
Centel valuing Centel at Dollars 2.85bn, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which posted only slim gains through most
of the day, surged in the last minutes of trading to close 27.99 ahead at
3,398.43.
New York SE volume stayed moderate, at 195.3m shares, while advances
outpaced declines by 986 to 689. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 4.57 to
416.74 and the Nasdaq composite was up 3.14 at 580.49.
Mr Philip Smyth, an analyst at Birinyi Associates in New York, said equities
were helped by the strength of the bond market through the day, but 'it was
the programme buying at the end of the day which really lifted the market'.
There was little reaction to news that jobless claims for the week ending
May 16 had fallen by 4,000 in a week when many analysts had expected claims
to rise.
A proposed stock-swap merger between Sprint, the third biggest US
long-distance telephone company, and Centel, a Chicago-based local telephone
concern, wreaked havoc with telephone company stocks yesterday. Investors
were jolted by the low valuation of Centel, whose holders will receive
Sprint stock valued at Dollars 33.57, nearly Dollars 9 below Centel's
closing price of Dollars 42 1/2 on Wednesday. Centel plummeted Dollars 10
5/8 to Dollars 31 7/8 yesterday and Sprint slipped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars
23 1/8 .
The low price threw into question how other cellular companies are valued
and led to strong selling of cellular company shares. Lin Broadcasting fell
Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 68, McCaw Cellular Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 27 1/2
and GTE Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 31 1/4 .
Among other long-distance carriers, AT&amp;T firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 42
1/2 and MCI Communications put on Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 31 7/8 .
The airline sector was depressed by concern about an accelerated fare war
triggered by news that American Airlines was cutting its lowest advance
purchase fares by 50 per cent. AMR, parent of American Airlines, shed
Dollars 2 to Dollars 61 5/8 , UAL, parent of United Airlines, dropped
Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 114, USAir lost Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 12 1/8 and
Delta Air Lines eased Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 57.
Shares in US cereal makers rose after Kellogg said it was increasing US
cereal prices by an average of 3.5 per cent. Kellogg moved ahead Dollars 3
3/8 to Dollars 59 3/8 , General Mills Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 62 1/4 and
Quaker Oats Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 56 3/8 .
Auto issues, which climbed on Wednesday after surprisingly strong mid-May
car sales, were higher. Ford firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 44 1/4 , General
Motors Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 39 1/4 and Chrysler Dollars  1/4 to Dollars
18 1/8 .
Canada
TORONTO posted a small decline after moderate trading. The composite index
ended 7.5 off at 3,375.3 as falls outnumbered rises by 293 to 235. Volume
came to 25.6m shares valued at CDollars 324.7m.
The financial services group shed 0.88 per cent as the leading Canadian
banks continued to report their second-quarter results and the effect on
those results of Olympia &amp; York's financial problems.
