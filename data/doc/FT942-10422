FT  11 MAY 94 / Oslo government may fall
Norway's minority Labour government faces a vote of confidence this month
over its appointment last August of Mr Torstein Moland as governor of the
Bank of Norway. The 32-seat anti-EC agrarian Centre party said it would
table the confidence motion in parliament on May 24 and was willing to form
a new government should it gather enough support in the 165-seat parliament
to unseat Labour. Mr Moland, a former state secretary with an earlier Labour
government, took up his Bank of Norway post on January 1 but became
entangled in a tax controversy. Yesterday, majority support for the
confidence motion was far from certain though extremely close. To muster the
83-vote majority, backing is needed from the Socialist Left (SV) party's 13
members and four ex-members of the Progress party which were expected to
meet last night to decide their stand. The SV party in February called for
Mr Moland's resignation, saying his authority had been undermined. Karen
