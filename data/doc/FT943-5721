FT  02 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Perverse argument
Sir, The concluding paragraph of your editorial 'Venturing Capital' (August
30) surprised me. 'Generating more investment in small enterprises. .
.cannot in itself be regarded as a sane objective' looks perverse, when
earlier you point out some of the peculiar problems that small companies
face in raising funds. If the cost of due diligence is high in relation to
the sums invested, surely that argues for an enhanced return after a
successful investment? No one doubts the contribution that small business
can make to the economy; it seems a pity that so many hopeful enterprises
are strangled at birth.
Of course fiscal treatment is only part of the solution; the availability of
quality information on investment opportunities is also crucial. That is
what we are trying to promote.
