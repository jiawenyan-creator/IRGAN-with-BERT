FT  16 APR 91 / Yugoslav airline strike goes on
A strike that has grounded all flights of the Yugoslav airline JAT since
Thursday is costing the already heavily-indebted carrier Dollars 1.5m a day,
the company said.
The strike by technical staff began on April 4 and JAT Director-General
Miodrag Vasiljevic ordered all flights cancelled from midnight last
Wednesday.
The strikers are demanding two months' unpaid wages.
