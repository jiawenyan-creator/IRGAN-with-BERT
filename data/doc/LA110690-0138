MUSIC REVIEW; 
FOUR WORKS BY CONSTANTINIDES MAKE UP NORTHRIDGE PROGRAM 
Four compositions from three decades by Dinos Constantinides made up a mildly 
interesting concert by the Cal State Northridge New Music Ensemble conducted by 
Daniel Kessner Sunday night. The Louisiana-based composer attended the event in 
Northridge's Recital Hall, offering introductory comments before most of the 
pieces. 
Constantinides, a 61-year-old native of Greece, writes in a simple, tonal 
language that explores folk music and lyricism without pretense or showy 
virtuosity. His work emphasizes carefully lucid melodic lines, though sometimes 
in ways unadventurous and woodenly pedagogic. 
In "Listenings and Silences for Voice Alone" (1988), he sets three texts by 
Pinkie Gordon Lane -- a black poet from Baton Rouge, where Constantinides has 
taught composition for the past 24 years. Predictable word-painting, with of 
humming, spoken words and melismatic singing accompany descriptions of 
whispering, descending light and the passage of time. 
Throughout, a tonal, tuneful quality handsomely suggests a traditional 
spiritual style without patronizing or satirizing it. Soprano Theresa Villa 
gave a poised, dramatic performance that captivated the listener. 
The composer's "Antitheses" (1975) for chamber orchestra utilizes a 
sentimental, less-convincing neo-Romanticism seasoned with frequent percussive 
bursts. 
The ensemble of 14 players gave a timid reading of the work, with specific 
players consistently out of sync. 
Constantinides opened the program himself ruggedly performing his serial Sonata 
No. 1 (1968) for violin solo. A three-movement, jazzy study, "Homage: A Folk 
Concerto for Flute"(1988) for flute and piano, closed the program pleasantly.
