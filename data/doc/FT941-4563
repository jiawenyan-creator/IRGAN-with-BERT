FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: PosGold may sell Aztec stake to
Pancon
PosGold Investments, part of Mr Robert de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon
group and the winner on Tuesday of an ADollars 287m (USDollars 206m) bid
battle for Aztec Mining, yesterday left open the possiblity that it could
accept an offer from Pancontinental Mining for its newly-acquired Aztec
holding.
Pancontinental was the second bidder for Aztec, offering a mixture of
ordinary shares and options, in contrast to PosGold's cash terms. When
PosGold snapped up more than three-quarters of Aztec's shares through a
stock-market raid, Pancontinental said it was withdrawing its rival bid.
It is unclear, however, whether Australian takeover rules make this
possible. Moreover, even if the Pancon offer carries a 90 per cent
acceptance condition, PosGold could be in a position to satisfy this; it
said yesterday it was interested in not less than 90 per cent of Aztec's
shares.
PosGold made no definitive statements yesterday, but said that if Aztec's
rival suitor was obliged to keep its offer on the table, it would review the
option of accepting. 'You have to look at all opportunities,' commented the
company yesterday. Such action would give PosGold a large minority stake in
Pancon.
