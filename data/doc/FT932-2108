FT  21 JUN 93 / Blow for auditors of failed thrifts
NEGOTIATIONS between banking regulators and several US accounting firms for
out-of-court settlements in connection with their audits of failed savings
and loans institutions appear to have suffered a setback.
The Resolution Trust Corporation has filed a series of lawsuits against
Deloitte &amp; Touche which had previously been on hold while discussions took
place with government officials.
Last year it issued suits in place of negotiations against Arthur Andersen,
and it has also brought action against KPMG Peat Marwick in relation to
audits of failed thrifts and banks. It has filed a total of 250 professional
indemnity suits.
Until earlier this year the agency had been in discussion with Deloitte &amp;
Touche using 'tolling agreements', which allow talks to continue without
lawsuits being filed beyond the normal three year statute of limitations.
Six such tolling agreements between the RTC and Deloitte &amp; Touche lapsed
earlier this year and suits have now been filed, leaving the firm with 12
suits with claims for about Dollars 1.4bn.
Last summer the RTC filed a suit against Andersen several months after the
limitation period was up, suggesting a similar tolling agreement had been in
place and then allowed to expire.
The approach appears to contrast with the negotiated 'omnibus' legal
settlement announced last November with Ernst &amp; Young, in which the firm
agreed to pay Dollars 400m and retrain staff in exchange for dropping a
series of actions.
Those close to the negotiations from the accounting firms suggest that the
new difficulties have in part been generated by a change in key staff in the
three regulatory bodies taking legal action, the RTC, the Office of Thrift
Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. They also point
to criticism of the agreement with Ernst &amp; Young by Henry Gonzalez, US House
banking committee chairman.
