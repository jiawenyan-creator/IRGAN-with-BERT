  [Text] Moscow, February 4 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin may soon appoint three scholars, who are known for 
their "independent outlook" as his aides, presidential sources 
said on Friday [4 February]. 
  The three "stars," Georgiy Satarov, Emil Paine and Leonid 
Smirnyagin, are all members of the Presidential Council at 
present. But they have always expressed their "independent 
opinions" that cause "discontent" of the president, the sources 
said. 
  Satarov is expected to be named presidential aide for 
working 
with the Parliament. Paine is an expert on nationalities 
problems, and Smirnyagin on regional policy. 
  Satarov reportedly aims to create "the necessary political 
atmosphere in which the relations of the president and the 
Parliament are based on a two-way flow of information." 
  Paine and Smirnyagin will enrich the presidential 
administration with their scientific and research potential. 
  The three, if appointed, would join another "independent" 
expert, Yuriy Baturin, who recently became the presidential 
national security adviser. 
  Baturin came to work for the president from the foundation 
created by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, and was 
the only member of the presidential support group to express 
disagreement with Yeltsin's decree dissolving the former 
Parliament last October. 
  According to the sources, Yeltsin is planning to consult 
Baturin, Satarov, Paine and Smirnyagin during preparations of 
his state of the nation address which he is to make to the 
two-chamber Parliament.
