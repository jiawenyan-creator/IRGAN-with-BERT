 

The Commission requests comment concerning the proposed treatment of investee pools. In particular, commenters
are invited to address any special public policy or disclosure considerations presented by tiered investment structures
by means of which a commodity pool can, in effect, appropriate the value of a second fund's management by investing
all or a portion of its funds in the second fund. The Commission also requests comment concerning whether any additional
protections, other than disclosure of applicable fees, are appropriate in light of the ``layering'' of fees that
typically occurs at each level of a fund of funds structure. 


4. Risk Disclosure Statement 


Rule 4.21 currently requires that disclosure documents include a prescribed bold-face statement alerting prospective
pool participants to the risks involved in participating in a pool. This statement does not specifically address
the risks of trading foreign futures or foreign option contracts. The risks attributable to foreign futures and foreign
options were originally required to be addressed by a special disclosure statement, set forth in part 30 of the Commission's
regulations, which generally governs transactions in foreign futures and foreign options.

52

 Thus, a CPO offering a pool expected to trade foreign and domestic futures or options was required to include in the
disclosure document the Rule 4.21 risk disclosure statement, which does not refer to foreign futures or options,
and the Rule 30.6 foreign futures and options risk disclosure statement. However, Rule 1.55, the basic risk disclosure
requirement applicable to FCMs and IBs opening accounts for domestic futures and option contracts, was recently
amended to consolidate the required disclosures concerning foreign futures and options into the domestic risk disclosure
statement, and the separate Rule 30.6(a) disclosure statement was eliminated.

53

 Consequently, under the revised Rules 1.55 and 30.6, CPOs and CTAs offering pools and accounts, respectively, which
may engage in foreign futures and option transactions would be required to include the new consolidated Rule 1.55
risk disclosure statement as well as the part 4 risk disclosure statement in the disclosure document.

The Rule 30.6(a) statement was required to be provided by FCMs and IBs to clients opening foreign futures or foreign
option accounts and, pursuant to Rule 30.6(b), by CPOs and CTAs trading foreign contracts for their pool or clients.

58 FR 17495 (April 5, 1993). 

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission is proposing to address the potential for duplicative disclosure created by the recent rule revisions
and to eliminate the necessity for providing two prescribed risk disclosure statements by revising the part 4 risk
disclosure statements for CPOs and CTAs to address the risks of foreign as well as domestic transactions. Rule 30.6(b)
would be revised to cross-reference the part 4 statement. In addition, the terms ``domestic'' and ``foreign'' previously
used to refer to contract markets or exchanges in foreign jurisdictions are proposed to be replaced with the terms
``United States'' and ``non-United States'' to avoid confusion in the context of offerings in non-United States
jurisdictions to non-United States participants for whom the term ``foreign'' does not mean ``non-United States''.

54

 Rule 1.55 would also be amended to provide that pools need not be treated as customers for the purposes of delivery of
the risk disclosure statement.
