FT  01 FEB 92 / Public services spending hits record levels
THE RAPID rise of Mr John Major to prime minister has coincided with
government spending on services jumping to record levels, according to
Treasury figures published yesterday.
The statistical supplement to November's Autumn Statement shows that
combined spending by central and local government on health, education and
science, social security and transport is running at record levels, adjusted
for inflation, in this financial year.
The figures - presented as 'general government spending by function' for the
first time - also show that real spending on law and order, environmental
services and arts and libraries will reach new highs in 1991-92.
Overall spending on services by central and local government last fell in
real terms in 1988-89, when it declined by 2.3 per cent compared with
1987-88.
At that time Mr Major was chief secretary to the Treasury in charge of
public spending. His subsequent career - with a short spell as foreign
secretary, followed by his time as chancellor and prime minister - has been
accompanied by a 9.3 per cent inflation-adjusted jump in spending on
services by central and local government to an estimated Pounds 218.6bn in
this financial year.
The statistical supplement confirms that spending on social security will
jump sharply this year to Pounds 69.3bn in nominal terms, from Pounds 58.8bn
in 1990-91. That is largely because the recession has pushed up unemployment
and income-support payments.
By combining the data for spending by central government and local
authorities, the supplement gives the first clear picture of overall
spending on education and science. It will total Pounds 31bn in 1991-92  -
nearly as much as the Pounds 31.4bn allocated to health.
The Treasury's figures show that residents of Northern Ireland, Scotland and
Wales receive more in public spending than those in England. General
government expenditure per head in Northern Ireland was Pounds 3,842 in
1990-91, against Pounds 2,964 in Wales, Pounds 2,586 in England and the UK
average of Pounds 2,694.
In Scotland, where a recent opinion poll showed 50 per cent of voters
favouring independence, government expenditure was Pounds 3,196 a head.
Scotland accounted for 11 per cent of government spending while its share of
gross domestic product was 8.2 per cent.
The report also illustrates how government spending priorities have changed
since Mrs Margaret Thatcher's first government took office in 1979.
The Pounds 5.59bn spent on housing this year will be 55 per cent less in
real terms than in 1979-80. Perhaps more surprising, the Pounds 2.8bn
allocated for public spending on employment and training this year will be
42 per cent less in real terms than in 1986-87, when expenditure on such
items peaked.
The government has made only very small revisions to the public spending
totals fixed for 1991-92 and subsequent years in the Autumn Statement.
This year's general government expenditure (GGE) total is now estimated at
Pounds 236.4bn, up Pounds 300m on November's figure, while Pounds 100m has
been added to GGE estimates for each of the following three financial years.
