  [Text] Presidential candidate Leonid Kuchma yesterday 
visited Vinnytsya. On the threshold of 21st century, a 
stone-age economy cannot ensure Ukraine's full-fledged 
existence. In the candidate's opinion, Ukraine's path is to 
develop its economy in a modern way, with a national market and 
capital. Leonid Kuchma stands for mutually beneficial forms of 
integration with the CIS and the entire world. The state has 
already gone through the stage of declaring political 
independence. [Words indistinct] is the confirmation of real 
economic independence, the presidential candidate believes.
