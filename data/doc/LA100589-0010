ADDICTION 
Dr. Stanley Korenman's commentary (Op-Ed Page, Sept. 7) on drug addiction 
naively asserts that animal experiments hold the key to this difficult problem. 
The idea is that if we learn the biochemical basis for addiction and then 
develop medicines that block the craving for recreational drugs, addicts will 
forget the high they get from drugs. As a doctor who treats scores of addicts, 
I find that scenario all too simplistic. All the animal experiments Korenman's 
colleagues can devise will not change the fundamental social problem of drug 
abuse and addiction. Addicts whose cravings are attenuated by medications can 
easily stop taking them to once again experience the high and the 
anxiety-reducing effects of illegal drugs. 
It is no surprise that the medications used to treat alcoholism pale in 
comparison to the power of Alcoholics Anonymous. These are social problems 
which are not solved by simplistic chemical answers. Rather than spending 
millions on futile animal experiments, we should invest in making the 
treatments we have more widely available, the greatest of which are 
detoxification and social supports.
