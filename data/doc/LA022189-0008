MORNING REPORT: MOVIES 
Actress Kathleen Turner spoke to about 2,700 Girl Scouts in Springfield, Mo., 
over the weekend about her film-making career and then appeared at a 
fund-raising dinner for Girl Scout Camp Finbrooke. "The older girls mainly 
wanted to know what it was like kissing Michael Douglas" in the movies 
"Romancing the Stone" and "Jewel of the Nile," Turner said. "I told them 'he's 
not bad.' " Turner, whose mother has been a Girl Scout volunteer since the 
1960s, said she grew up with the Girl Scouts. Shauna Snow
