  [Text] Washington--Slovakia will seek to obtain a World 
Bank loan for the structural reform of the entrepreneurial and 
financial sector (EFSAL). The condition for obtaining this loan 
is a thorough analysis of the situation in the two sectors, but 
also [the realization of] a large number of measures that should 
have been implemented by the previous governments several years 
ago, Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova told the TA SR 
correspondent following her talks with Wilfried Thalwitz, 
executive director of the World Bank for Europe, and Kemal 
Dervis, director of the World Bank's European Department. 
  According to her words, even as early as during the start of 
preparations for privatization under the federation, clear 
criteria should have been laid down for the state's 
participation in the entrepreneurial sphere. The state's 
participation, through the medium of the National Property Fund, 
in the entrepreneurial sphere remains very high today, and its 
interference in the management of enterprises is excessive and 
extremely harmful. It is therefore necessary to determine very 
specifically under which conditions and until when the state 
will maintain its ownership stake in the entrepreneurial sphere. 
  Furthermore, the government must prepare, as soon as 
possible, a list of enterprises that it wants to privatize by 
the end of the year. It considers the previous government's 
commitment to privatize another one-fifth of enterprises to be 
the minimum. 
  Brigita Schmognerova said that it will also be necessary to 
start applying the law on bankruptcy and settlement with a clear 
idea about the consequences of its application. 
  Other measures necessary to obtain the loan include 
better-quality information about the entrepreneurial sphere and, 
in particular, reliable data for the past two years.
