FT  01 NOV 94 / US personal income rises
US personal income rose in September for the eighth month in a row, the
Commerce Department reported yesterday, but consumption spending, though
still increasing, showed some signs of weakening. Personal income rose by
0.6 per cent in September from August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of Dollars 5,756.7bn as wage and salary income continued to advance.
Disposable income, after deducting tax payments and some other non-tax
payments, also rose by 0.6 per cent. Personal consumption expenditures,
however, rose only 0.2 per cent in September after gaining 0.8 per cent in
August. Spending on durable goods, which had surged in August, fell slightly
as car purchases tailed off, while spending on services and non-durable
goods continued to rise. In a separate announcement the Purchasing
Management Association of Chicago said its index of business activity rose
to 64.3 per cent in October from 63.3 per cent the previous month. The
association said its index of prices paid by businesses rose to 72.5 per
cent from 72.1 per cent in September.
