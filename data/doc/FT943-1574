FT  23 SEP 94 / Observer: Global village
Gin drinkers and others who have been hanging on thirstily to see who would
replace Crispin Davis as head of Guinness's spirits division, United
Distillers, were yesterday left uncertain as to whether to raise their
glasses in a toast. An almost 12-month search has culminated in the hiring
of the boss of a Swedish cement company.
Sadly, Finn Johnsson, chief executive of Euroc, may well not bring immediate
cheer by reversing the dastardly act committed by his predecessor, who
reduced the proof of Gordon's gin to 37.5 per cent from 40 per cent. But he
will certainly be able to put to use those international marketing skills
about which his prospective employer was yesterday enthusing. While
followers of the drinks business were enquiring as to what Euroc did for a
living, Guinness was inundated by calls from curious Swedish journalists who
cheerfully admitted that they had never heard of the British company.
