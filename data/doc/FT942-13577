FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: GKN's revised bid terms
GKN, the engineering and industrial services group, yesterday announced the
terms of its revised partial share offer for Westland investors who have
accepted its Pounds 577m hostile bid.
Although GKN increased its cash offer from 290p to 335p, it found that its
partial share alternative, which is worth 194.7p in cash and a quarter of a
new GKN share, was almost 30 per cent oversubscribed, the directors said.
The group said it would scale down applications for new GKN shares to 77.35
per cent on a pro rata basis.
The balance will be satisfied in cash or with Pounds 1 GKN loan notes.
