FT  16 MAY 92 / Blunkett urges party reforms
SWEEPING reforms of Labour's organisation were called for last night by Mr
David Blunkett, a member of the party's national executive and campaign
manager for Mr Bryan Gould's leadership bid.
In a speech interpreted as an attack on the tightly knit group who ran the
general election campaign, Mr Blunkett said the party's defeat should prompt
a radical reorganisation that would switch the focus of its effort from its
headquarters to local activists.
He urged greater emphasis on campaigning and a redirection of the party's
resources from central to local level, alongside a move to strengthen
political control over communications' strategies.
Meanwhile, Mr John Prescott, Labour transport spokesman, has won the backing
of two union executives in his challenge for the deputy leadership of the
party.
Mr Prescott has made a strong bid for the union vote, warning against any
radical break in union-party links. With union backing he may put in a
strong challenge to Mrs Margaret Beckett, the favourite for the deputy post.
The two executives to back him are those of Nupe, the public-service union,
and GPMU, the print union. Both unions are conducting ballots of their
members so it is possible that the executive recommendations could be
ignored.
Mr Prescott, who is regarded as the candidate of the left, is unlikely to
receive the backing of the largest unions.
