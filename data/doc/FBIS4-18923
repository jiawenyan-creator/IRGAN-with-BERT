  [Text] Berlin -- The Berlin-based German Economic 
Research Institute [DIW] expects a significant increase in the 
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate at the end of 1994. At 
the same time, workers' purchasing power will further decline. 
  The loss of jobs in west German manufacturing, mining, and 
energy is expected to continue at the same rate as in the 
previous quarter, according to the latest DIW weekly bulletin. 
The moderate collective agreement settlements do potentially 
mean that the cost burden on companies will be reduced, but they 
will also have a negative impact on domestic sales. If and when 
a reduction in costs is really to occur remains an open question. 
  In western Germany, employment continued to fall in the 
fourth quarter of 1993. According to the DIW, the seasonally 
adjusted unemployment rate rose by 100,000 (120,000 in the third 
quarter). That means that the average unemployment rate in 1993 
amounted to 7.4 percent. Compared to the final quarter of 1992, 
the number of unemployed fell by 2.4 percent or 614,000 to 25.5 
million. In the fourth quarter of 1993, the seasonally adjusted 
number of job vacancies fell by 8 percent to 217,000. 
  During the second half of 1993, the east German labor market 
stabilized at a lower level. According to the DIW, the 
unemployment rate of 15.3 percent (13.8 percent in the second 
half of the year) makes the situation appear to be better than 
it actually is, because a increasing number of employees are 
losing their entitlements to fringe benefits. On an annual 
average basis, the number of part-time employees in the new 
laender has been halved compared to 1992 and stands at 181,000. 
Job vacancies rose slightly in 1993 to 36,000 (33,000 in 1992). 
  There was a massive reduction in the number of jobs in west 
German industry in 1993. In the construction industry, the 
level of employment remained static, and in the services sector, 
the number of jobs compared to 1992 rose by almost 160,000. In 
the final quarter of 1993, manufacturing industry shed 140,000 
employees (175,000 in the third quarter). The capital goods 
sector registered the largest loss of jobs compared to the 
previous quarter, one of 2.1 percent. Altogether, the number of 
jobs in manufacturing industry fell by almost 500,000 in 1993. 
  In the final quarter of 1993, the average income of the 
employed in the old laender rose by 2.7 percent to 4,575 German 
marks [DM]. In view of the reduction in the number of jobs, 
gross wages and salaries only rose by 0.2 percent to DM350 
billion. Whereas unit labor costs in the economy as a whole did 
not rise as sharply in the second half of the year as in the 
first half, those in manufacturing actually fell by 1.7 percent 
in the fourth quarter compared to the same period a year before. 
  Employment trends in eastern Germany did not change during 
the quarter covered by the report. In the case of job losses in 
manufacturing, those affected were mainly part-time workers, 
while the number of those in full-time employment remained 
static. On the other hand, in the case of the production of 
materials and industrial goods, which particularly profited from 
the expansion of the construction industry, the number of people 
in full-time employment rose significantly compared to the 
previous year. In the case of capital goods, there was a slight 
improvement in the second half of the year. There was a 
moderate rise in employment in the tertiary sector. 
  Compared to the previous year, gross wages and salaries rose 
by 5.7 percent, to DM53 billion, during the period covered by 
the report. This corresponds to an increase in the average 
income of employed persons of 9 percent, to DM3,125. There was a 
particularly sharp increase in the incomes of employees in the 
materials and industrial goods sectors (one of 16 percent to 
DM3,045), but they are only 51 percent of the west German level. 
In the new laender, the average annual increase in unit labor 
costs in the economy as a whole was only 2.1 percent as a result 
of modest upward adjustments in wages and salaries.
