  [Text] Tajik Prime Minister Abdulmadjid Samadov and Russian 
Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin ended talks in Moscow on Thursday 
by approving a draft agreement on this year's bilateral trade 
and economic cooperation between the two countries. 
  Speaking afterwards, Shokhin said the question of a new 
ruble 
zone was also high on the agenda. The two sides had agreed to 
speed up work by a joint commission on creating a common 
currency system. 
  The commission, due to meet later this month, is expected to 
discuss outstanding issues related to bilateral cooperation, 
Shokhin told reporters. 
  He says Russian experts will draw up measures designed to 
prevent the flight of Russian cash from Tajikistan. "For the 
time being, we are trying to gauge the prospects of creating a 
common ruble zone, but final conclusions will come later," 
Shokhin said.
