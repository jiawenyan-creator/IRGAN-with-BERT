FT  30 JUL 92 / Norton Rose leads on legal advice for takeovers
NORTON Rose, the City solicitors, was the leading legal adviser to companies
and financial advisers involved in takeovers during the first half of this
year.
The firm heads the takeover advice table for the first time, as a result of
its part in 10 bids with a combined value of Pounds 4.5bn. The table,
produced by Acquisitions Monthly, places Clifford Chance second, with seven
deals, worth Pounds 3.9bn, and Herbert Smith third, with five deals, worth
Pounds 1.2bn.
The two firms finishing above Norton Rose in last year's full-year rankings
 -Slaughter and May, which finished first with 24 deals, worth Pounds 5.5bn,
and Freshfields, which came second with 21 deals, worth Pounds 4.2bn - came
seventh and fifth respectively in the first half of this year.
The magazine comments that Freshfields is interesting, as it finished top in
1990 and in the first half of last year. The magazine says the first half of
this year has been 'a less than fruitful period in a very competitive
sector'.
The first-half figures are dominated by the Pounds 3.7bn bid by Hongkong &amp;
Shanghai Banking Corporation for Midland Bank. Norton Rose acted for HSBC,
and Clifford Chance for Midland.
Norton Rose also owes its position at the top of the table to its part in
four of the seven largest deals in the first half of this year. They include
the Pounds 613m Redland-Steetley deal.
Excluding the Midland deal, the top 10 firms acted on deals totalling Pounds
4.2bn, some Pounds 700m less than in the first half of last year.
The number of deals also fell from 66 in the first half of last year to 53
in the first half of this year.
The magazine points out, however, that over the past two years the trend has
been for takeover activity to pick up in the latter half of the year.
