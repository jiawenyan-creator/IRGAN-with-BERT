  [Text] Russia can count on an additional $1 Bn [Billion] 
credit from the American Exxim Bank. The fact was disclosed in 
an exclusive interview for Interfax by the Russian Deputy 
Prime-Minister for Economics Aleksandr Shokhin. 
  Earlier the American bank agreed with the Russian side on a 
$2 Bn credit most of which was to be spent on imports of 
American equipment and technologies. 
  According to the official the additional credit will be 
given 
at the same terms and be used to purchase oil and gas equipment 
and modernize Russian industrial facilities which possess a high 
export potential "which can guarantee the repayment of the 
credits," Shokhin stressed. 
  He also said that while the Russian government is taking 
steps to protect foreign investments from political risks, it is 
also inclined to apply stricter requirements to foreign 
investors. 
  "Even now the offers of foreign investments under government 
guarantees are two times greater than the amount we can actually 
use. Some banks put forward as a condition of investment the 
submission of detailed financial and statistical reports about 
certain companies for the past ten years. I doubt whether we 
can and should do that," Shokhin said. 
  On increasing the country's export potential he said that 
the 
Ministry of Economics is determined to work for the abolition of 
all export quotas. In his opinion Russian manufacturers need 
the removal of quotas on oil products the domestic demand for 
which has sharply dropped, as well as the gradual reduction of 
quotas on crude oil. "Otherwise we will really be forced to 
close down productive oil-fields." Shokhin also said that the 
export quotas for the second quarter of this year can serve as 
an indication of the efforts of his ministry in this direction.
