FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Windy City likely to absorb
jobless blow
THE closure of the catalogue and the 50,000 new layoffs at Sears nationwide
is expected to cause barely a ripple in the economy of the Big Store's home
town, Chicago. 'It's kind of an irony,' said Ms Diane Swonk, regional
economist at First Chicago. 'If this had to happen it's better to have
happened in Chicago than in New York or Los Angeles.' Metropolitan Chicago
has weathered the recession better than those cities, she said. Other
retailers are entering the Chicago market and should absorb the estimated
4,500 area employees the restructuring will make jobless. The
Dayton-Hudson-owned discount chain, Target, plans to open stores, while
electronics retailer Best Buy and Texas-based Nordstroms are also expanding.
