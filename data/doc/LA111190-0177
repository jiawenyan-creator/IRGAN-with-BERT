MARTIN SCORSESE'S OBSESSION 
So Martin Scorsese "is considered the most interesting and talented director in 
America, if not the world" ("The Passion of Martin Scorsese," by T.J. English, 
Sept. 23). 
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but the last time I looked, Woody Allen, 
Francis Ford Coppola and Stanley Kubrick are still making movies. 
And Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Akira Kurosawa and David Lean, while not 
as active as they once were, are still alive.
