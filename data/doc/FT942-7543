FT  25 MAY 94 / Arts: Today's Television
It never rains but it pours. After all those nights when there was nothing
to watch comes a night chock-a-block with tempting offers. Sharpe is the
first of three more cannon-and-cleavage dramas, each two hours long. Sean
Bean plays the title role of a maverick soldier in Wellington's army during
the Napoleonic wars (8.00 ITV). The first in a six-part series of half-hour
documentaries, Baby It's You, explains how a baby achieves more in its first
two years than in the rest of its life (8.30 C4). This week's 'Screen Two'
is Men Of The Month and Douglas Hodge, familiar from 'Middlemarch', 'Capital
City' and much else, plays one of four men whose lives are connected with 'a
women's erotic magazine' as the BBC puts it (9.00 BBC2). Inside Story goes
to Gateshead to study burglary from the point of view of the burgled, the
burglars, and the police (9.30 BBC1). ITV begins a four-part documentary
series called The Windsors which, for once, is not primarily about Di and
Charles, or Fergie and whatsisname. It begins with George V changing his
name (10.45).
