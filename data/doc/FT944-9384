FT  16 NOV 94 / Cardoso party ahead in governors' polls
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's president elect, looked set to emerge
as the big winner in yesterday's gubernatorial elections after candidates
from his Social Democracy party (PSDB) were shown by exit polls to have
easily won the three most important states.
According to polling agency Ibope, PSDB candidates were set to win in Sao
Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, which together account for more than
40 per cent of Brazil's voters.
The PSDB and its allies also appeared set to win the big northern state of
Para and the north-eastern state of Bahia.
Elections were held in 17 states and the capital, Braslia. The remaining
nine states decided their governors last month. First results from
yesterday's polls are expected today.
