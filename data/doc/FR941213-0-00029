 

To address deficiencies identified by EPA, the State took commitments through the public hearing process on November
23, 1992, and submitted the commitments to EPA as additional tasks to be completed to correct the deficiencies in the
Missoula and statewide SIP (a more detailed discussion of these commitments can be found in EPA's prior proposed rulemaking
action on the Montana PM

10

 SIP revisions for Missoula (58 FR 48339, September 15, 1993), the Technical Support Document (TSD) for that action,
Section II.E. below, and the TSD for this action). 

Due to the satisfaction of those commitments, EPA is now approving the following Missoula City-County Air Pollution
Control Program regulations as adopted by the State of Montana on June 28, 1991 and submitted to EPA by Montana's Governor
on August 20, 1991, with amendments adopted by the State on March 20, 1992 and November 19, 1993 and submitted to EPA
by the Governor on June 4, 1992 and March 2, 1994, respectively: Chapter IX_Subchapter 4, Emergency Procedures; Subchapter
13, Open Burning; and Subchapter 14, Rule 1407, Wood-Waste Burners. 

EPA is also approving the following minor revisions to two previously approved chapters of the Missoula City-County
Air Pollution Control Program_revisions to Chapter VII, involving a name change for the advisory council, and revisions
to Chapter VIII, regarding inspections. These revisions were also adopted by the State on November 19, 1993 and were
included in the March 2, 1994 submittal. 



A. Analysis of State Submission 



The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by
a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.

3

 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under
the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing.

Also section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions
of section 110(a)(2). 

</FOOTNOTE>


EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see
Section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51,
appendix V. The EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However,
a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after
receipt of the submission. 

To entertain public comment, the State of Montana, after providing adequate notice, held public hearings for the
local air pollution control program on June 28, 1991 and March 2, 1992, and a hearing was held on November 19, 1993 to
address the Missoula contingency measures and further revisions to the local air pollution control program regulations.
Following the public hearings, the local air pollution control plan, revisions, and the Missoula contingency measures
were adopted by the State. 

The local air pollution control program was submitted as a proposed revision to the SIP by the Governor with a letter
dated August 20, 1991. In a letter to the State dated December 4, 1991, EPA identified deficiencies with the local program.
Some of these deficiencies were addressed in the Missoula PM

10

 SIP, which was submitted by the Governor to EPA in a letter dated June 4, 1992. Commitments to correct the remaining
deficiencies were submitted by the Governor in a letter dated November 30, 1992. EPA described the commitments and
approved the provisions of the local program that were not affected by these commitments on January 18, 1994 (59 FR
2537). A detailed description of the Missoula City-County regulations that are the subject of this action, the deficiencies
that EPA identified in its December 4, 1991 letter to the State, the State's commitments to address these deficiencies,
and the current revisions is contained in the TSD for this action. 

The SIP revisions were reviewed by EPA to determine completeness in accordance with the completeness criteria set
out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. The submittals were found to be complete and letters dated December 4, 1991, December
11, 1992, and May 12, 1994 were forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittals and the next
steps to be taken in the review process. 



B. Contingency Measures 



The Clean Air Act requires State's containing PM

10

 nonattainment areas to adopt contingency measures that will take effect without further action by the State or EPA
upon a determination by EPA that an area failed to make reasonable further progress or to timely attain the applicable
NAAQS, as described in section 172(c)(9). See generally 57 FR 1351013512 and 1354313544. Pursuant
to section 172(b), the Administrator has established a schedule providing that states containing initial moderate
PM

10

 nonattainment areas shall submit SIP revisions containing contingency measures no later than November 15, 1993.
(See 57 FR 13543, n. 3.) 

The General Preamble further explains that contingency measures for PM

10

 should consist of other available control measures, beyond those necessary to meet the core moderate area control
requirement to implement reasonably available control measures (see Clean Air Act sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)).
Based on the statutory structure, EPA believes that contingency measures must, at a minimum, provide for continued
progress toward the attainment goal during the interim period between the determination that the SIP has failed to
achieve RFP/provide for timely attainment of the NAAQS and the additional formal air quality planning following
the determination (57 FR 13511).
