  [Text] Sofia, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Russia is planning to 
improve its military cooperation with Bulgaria and repay part of 
its debts to the country with weapons and military spare parts, 
local media reported today. 
  A 40-member Russian Government delegation led by Oleg Lobov, 
secretary of the Russian Security Council, signed an agreement 
on the deal during a visit to Sofia earlier this week. 
  It provides for joint manufacturing of highly accurate 
surface- to-air missile systems and radar equipment for coastal 
defense. 
  Following political changes in Bulgaria in 1989 its 
relations 
with Russia have been rather cool and military cooperation at a 
low level. 
  Now, many Bulgarian institutions are calling for a 
restoration of Bulgaria's traditional ties with Russia in a bid 
to seek guarantees for national security. 
  The delegation briefed Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev on 
Russia's stance on maintaining a regional balance, peace and 
security in the Black Sea area.
