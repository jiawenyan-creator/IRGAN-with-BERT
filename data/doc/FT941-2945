FT  18 MAR 94 / People: Non-executive directors
Oleg Popov, director-general of Zarubezneft, a Russian state oil company,
has joined the board of directors of Aminex, a small exploration and
production company quoted on the Irish exploration securities market.
Zarubezneft owns 49 per cent of East West Oil, which in turn owns almost 40
per cent of Aminex, which is involved in a production project in the Komi
Republic.
Brian Hall, the chairman, says the strong Russian involvement in Aminex has
opened doors for the company in that country. Popov will be the second
Russian on a Aminex's board.
