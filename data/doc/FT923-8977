FT  07 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
THE RESULTS from BP, together with more talk of a poor outlook for equities
in the wake of the continued recession, caused a retreat in stock index
futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September contract opened tentatively, with the first trade struck at
2,406. A period of sideways trading then ensued, with independent traders
responsible for most of the early activity, and the session's high point of
2,409 was recorded at around 9.30am.
The release of the BP results sent September falling to 2,365, with further
worries about the outlook for the UK economy also playing a part in the
retreat.
The Bundesbank's decision not to raise the Lombard rate, however, prompted a
rally in the September future in the afternoon, as did an early recovery on
Wall Street. September eventually closed at 2,385, down 30 from Wednesday's
close and 3 points below its fair value premim to cash of about 12. Turnover
at 6,885 remained dull.
The traded options saw an improvement on Wednesday's poor volume. Total
turnover reached 28,751 lots, with the FT-SE 100 option recording 11,863
trades. BP was the busiest stock option with 4,058 contracts dealt.
