  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 5 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's 
semiconductor industry, which soared on the wings of 4 
megabyte-dynamic random access memory [dram] chips last year, 
will switch its production lines over to 16 M-dram chips this 
year. The big three -- Samsung Electronics Co., Goldstar 
Electron, and Hyundai Electronics Ind. Co. -- will complete 
facility improvements by June and expect 16 M-dram chips to 
completely replace 4 M-dram chips on the world market this year. 
A 16 M-dram is a high value-added product with an export price 
of 70 U.S. dollars compared with a 12 dollars for a 4 M-dram 
chip. 
  Samsung began mass production of 16 M-dram chips last year 
and exported 1 million in December, but it will expand the 
production line to increase capacity to 6 million chips a month. 
Samsung, already ahead of Japanese semiconductor makers in mass 
production, says that it expects to supply about 30 percent of 
the world demand for the 16 M-dram chips this year. 
  Goldstar will invest 500 billion won (618.8 million U.S. 
dollars) in its 16 M-dram production line, which it plans to 
have turning out 2 million chips a month from June, while 
Hyundai will put 800 million won into construction of a plant to 
produce up to 4 million chips a month from April. 
  An official at the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry said 
on Wednesday that he expected Korea's semiconductor exports to 
reach 10 billion dollars this year. 
  "In the third quarter of the year, exports of 4 M-dram and 
16 
M-dram chips will be about equal in quantity, but most Korean 
semiconductor exports will be 16 M-dram chips by the end of the 
year," he said.
