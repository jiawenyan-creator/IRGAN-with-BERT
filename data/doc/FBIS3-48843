  [Text] Tokyo, January 28 (KNS-KCNA) -- The Federation of 
South Koreans in Japan for Democracy and Unification 
(Hantongnyon) released a statement today denouncing the arms 
buildup of the U.S. imperialists in South Korea. 
  Recalling that the U.S. defence deputy undersecretary and 
state deputy undersecretary recently announced many Patriot 
intercepting missiles, fighter planes and warships would be 
brought into South Korea and other large-scale joint military 
maneuvers be staged even if the "Team Spirit" was suspended, the 
statement condemned their belligerent outburst. 
  The statement said: 
  "The military crisis created by the United States on the 
Korean peninsula has reached a dangerous phase. 
  "If the negotiations between the North of Korea and the 
United States progress in line with the `solution in a package 
deal' including the settlement of the nuclear issue and the 
improvement of the DPRK-U.S. relations, military tension would 
be drastically defused, peace and denuclearization be promoted 
on the peninsula and, further, a favorable climate be provided 
for peaceful reunification of the North and the South. 
  "The latest move of the United States is not only a grave 
obstacle to the solution to the nuclear issue but also a 
criminal act threatening the existence of the Korean nation. 
  "We strongly demand that the decision to deploy Patriot 
missiles in South Korea be immediately cancelled and all the 
military maneuvres including the provocative `Team Spirit' joint 
military exercises be discontinued. 
  "The United States must, instead of bringing such 
sophisticated weapons as Patriot missiles into South Korea, cut 
back armaments, stop all kinds of military exercises there and 
hold the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks as early as 
possible."
