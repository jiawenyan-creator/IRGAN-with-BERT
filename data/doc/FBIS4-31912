  [Text] Tirana, June 14 (ATA) -- People have to wait in long 
queues up to seven hours to cross the border points between 
Kosova and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM] in Han Elezi and Gllobocica. 
  Serbian forces in this border crossing point exercise a 
severe and detailed control, maltreat and provoke Albanians, get 
their passports under various pretexts, especially as a 
punishment for visits to Albania. 
  After being deprived of their passports, the Albanians are 
sent to jail or punished by very high fines.
