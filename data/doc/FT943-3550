FT  13 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slips as takeover news
holds attention
Wall Street
US share prices receded yesterday in a mostly lacklustre session highlighted
by takeover news in the food, insurance and health care sectors, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 14.47 lower at 3,860.34, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 shed 1.97 to 466.21. In the
secondary markets, the American SE composite was up a scant 0.52 at 455.06
but the Nasdaq composite receded 3.72 to 760.01.
For the most part it was a day of waiting on Wall Street. Many investors
were quietly adjusting their positions ahead of the release this morning of
the August consumer price index. As a result, volume was light, with 245m
shares traded on the Big Board by the close.
Before a sharp increase in producer prices was revealed last week, analysts
were forecasting a 0.4 per cent increase in the CPI. If the data came in
higher, as some observers feared yesterday, stocks could tumble along with
bond prices, as they had done on Friday.
In the meantime, an uneasy calm prevailed, although the Dow industrials were
hurt by a Dollars 1 1/4 decline in Caterpillar's share price to Dollars 54
1/4 . The company, which relies heavily on export markets, appeared
vulnerable after reports suggesting that Congress might not ratify the Gatt
world trade agreement this year. International Paper lost Dollars 1 3/8 at
Dollars 73 1/8 .
Elsewhere, blue chips languished in sluggish activity.
In spite of the overall lack of direction, a fresh batch of takeovers and a
wave of speculation on deals in the works inspired brisk trading in some
individual issues.
The day's most significant development was the announcement that Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts would offer RJR Nabisco stock for all of Borden's common
shares, in a deal valued at Dollars 2bn. Borden's share price, which had
been hovering near its 52-week low, climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 13 5/8 ,
while RJR retreated Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 6 3/4 .
In health care, GenCare Health Systems jumped Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 46
after agreeing to be acquired by United Healthcare for Dollars 520m in cash.
United was marked down Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 53.
By contrast, investors were cool to the news that two life insurers were
merging. USLICO retreated Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 20 3/8 and NWNL fell
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 29 7/8 after announcing a Dollars 237m unification
pact.
Woolworth added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 17 3/4 on a published report that
raised the possibility of a leveraged buyout of the retailer for Dollars
2.3bn, or Dollars 25 a share.
In pharmaceuticals, takeover speculation continued to swirl around
Warner-Lambert, sending it down Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 81 1/2 . SmithKline
Beecham was marked up Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 30 1/8 after agreeing to sell
the North American over-the-counter drugs business of its Sterling Winthrop
unit to Bayer's Miles Laboratories.
Canada
After a sharp morning fall, share prices in Toronto staged an afternoon
recovery to close little changed. Some analysts believed that the relative
stability of the market suggested that investors had already discounted an
expected victory by the separatist Parti Quebecois in yesterday's Quebec
provincial election.
The TSE 300 index was finally up 0.73 of a point at 4,329.87 as losing
issues outnumbered rises by 418 to 309 after volume of 72.2m shares.
