FT  31 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Total sees steady first half
Total, the French oil group, should achieve operating profits in the first
half of this year of about the same level as the FFr3.49bn (Dollars 591m)
recorded in the first six months of 1993, Mr Serge Tchuruk, chairman, said
yesterday.
Speaking at the annual shareholders' meeting, Mr Tchuruk said there was
still much potential to improve the group's results through increased
production and improved productivity.
According to Total, it should double production of oil and gas by the end of
the decade, compared with the level of output in 1990.
At the end of 1995, Total will produce 40 per cent more oil and gas than it
did in 1993, excluding Middle Eastern output, said Mr Tchuruk.
Hydrocarbon reserves are in excess of 4bn barrels of oil equivalent, with
the majority coming from the Middle East, east Asia and Latin America.
However, as a result of growth in new areas, Mr Tchuruk forecast the
proportion of the group's production from the Middle East would fall to
about one-third by the end of the decade from 50 per cent.
The Total chairman noted the improvement in oil prices at the beginning of
the second quarter of the year, but said that demand for oil products
remained relatively weak, particularly in France.
The company said it would pay a dividend of FFr7.5 per share for 1993,
compared with FFr7 in 1992. Last year, the group recorded net profits of
FFr2.9bn, a slight increase from the FFr2.8bn achieved in 1992.
