  [Text] A significant step was taken this afternoon in 
Lusaka, where the government and the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] reached an agreement on the 
delicate issue of the formation of the national police force. 
The agreement, which provides for UNITA's participation in the 
police force, was enthusiastically hailed by the negotiators. A 
source close to the talks told the REUTERS agency that this is 
extremely important because the agreement reached was not on a 
police for the government, nor UNITA, but a police force for the 
Angolans. The agreement provides for the new Angolan police 
force to consist of 26,700 members, of whom 5,500 from UNITA, 
namely 180 officers, 550 noncommissioned officers, and 4,770 
policemen. The next issue to be discussed is national 
reconciliation.
