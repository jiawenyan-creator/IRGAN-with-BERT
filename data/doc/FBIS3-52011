  [Text] The lack of a quorum has prevented the approval of 
three provisional measures from the government fiscal adjustment 
plan: provisional measures No. 404, which creates a control tax 
on the financial system; No. 407, which increases the income tax 
of large companies; and No. 401, which authorizes charging the 
IOF [Financial Operations Tax] on private funds and portfolios 
[fundos'e'carteiras livres]. 
  Luiz Carlos Santos, government leader in the Chamber of 
Deputies, believes that the result of the voting session today 
was not bad for the government, even though the mentioned 
provisional measures were not approved, because most of the 
other measures were approved. He said that provisional measures 
407 and 404 will not be presented again because of the annuity 
principle [principle by which a tax cannot be implemented on the 
same year it is approved by Congress]. 
  Some congressmen remarked that it was a contradiction that 
Congress did not approve a tax increase on large companies when 
yesterday it approved a tax increase on individuals. 
  Meanwhile, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso has 
just said that the national Congress has acted against the 
people by approving a tax increase only for wage earners. 
  [Begin recording] [Cardoso] I think it was a very bad thing 
because they approved a tax increase for individuals, for the 
citizens, but why not for large companies? Why shouldn't banks 
pay a control tax? What are those who blocked the approval of 
these measures defending? I do not know. Certainly it is not 
in favor of the people. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is it compromising for you? 
  [Cardoso] No, it is compromising for those who defended a 
wrong attitude. [end recording]
