FT  10 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Salomon launches election
hedge
SALOMON Brothers International has issued 2,000 put and 2,000 call warrants
on 10-year gilts. They are being marketed as instruments for hedging against
volatility created by the uncertainty surrounding the UK general election,
writes Tracy Corrigan.
The warrants mature in nine months, and so offer greater time value than is
available on the exchange-traded market, where the only liquid options
mature in June, according to Salomon Brothers. The warrants can be exercised
at any time during their nine-month life.
According to Mr Philippe Katz, of Salomon's arbitrage origination desk, the
volatility priced into the market ahead of this election is much lower than
ahead of the 1987 general election, even though the outcome this time is
less clear-cut. Consequently, it is cheaper for investors to hedge against
market movements.
Salomon reported a broad base of investor views: some investors bought call
options, on the expectation that the Conservatives would win and the gilt
market would rally; others bought the puts, taking the view that a Labour
victory could provoke a sterling crisis.
