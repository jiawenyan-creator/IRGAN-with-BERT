  [Text] Seoul, March 25 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has put its 
Armed Forces on a state of alert, while checking its emergency 
communications network and increasing military drills, Defense 
Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Agency for National Security Planning 
Director Kim Tok said. 
  They made the remarks in reporting on developments in North 
Korea at a meeting of security-related ministers that Prime 
Minister Yi Hoe-chang called on Friday, Information Minister O 
In-hwan said after the meeting. 
  The Stalinist regime is fueling North Koreans' hostility 
toward the South by talking about the inevitability of war and 
threatening to pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
if the U.N. Security Council imposes sanctions and has suspended 
issuance of travel permits, O quoted Yi and Kim as saying. 
  O said the meeting heard reports on developments in the 
nuclear situation over the past several days, including 
movements by the North Korean Armed Forces.
