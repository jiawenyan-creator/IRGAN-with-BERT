FT  18 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
Nymex PLATINUM group metals were down at midday amid nervousness over
President Clinton's state-of-the-union speech, which also kept trading in
Comex GOLD thin. Gold futures were down in early trading on disappointment
at the failure to attract safe-haven buying during the US stock market's
drop. NICKEL prices closed at six-week highs on the LME. Three-month metal
came within a whisker of Dollars 6,300 a tonne. Technical factors continued
to aid the market, as prices built on overnight US merchant buying. London
robusta COFFEE futures finished with trimmed gains. Light origin selling
helped to halt an earlier advance. Dealers said a close above Dollars 945 a
tonne on May would have been technically constructive and might have
triggered some fund buying today, but after peaking at Dollars 954 the rally
stalled. In Chicago WHEAT prices were sharply higher at midday in reaction
to trade talk that Turkey would tender for up to 400,000 tonnes of optional
wheat.
