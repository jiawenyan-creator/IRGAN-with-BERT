FT  29 JAN 93 / Technology: Toshiba pushes a pen-based micro - Worth
Watching
Notebook computer specialist Toshiba has given the seal of approval to
pen-based computing with the launch, initially in the US, of a hand-held
computer operated by a cordless stylus pen.
The machine, which weighs just over 3lbs including the battery, can run for
up to three hours on one charge. The T100X has a choice of operating
systems: Go's Penpoint or Microsoft's MS-Dos for Pen Computing.
Toshiba's latest laptops, the T4500 and T4500C, have clip-on Ballpoint Mouse
units and a liquid crystal display telling the user information such as how
many minutes of battery life remain. Toshiba: Japan, 03 3457 4511; UK, 0932
