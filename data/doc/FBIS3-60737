  [Text] The attack on the principles of German weapons 
exports seems well prepared. The year-old demands by the 
industry that the strict guidelines must be relaxed to save jobs 
are being heeded by an important figure in Bonn: Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe. 
  In a letter, he drew Chancellor Helmut Kohl's attention to 
the ``fundamental problems'' that the weapons industry is 
facing. Out of ``vital security-political interests'' and in 
order to ``remain capable of cooperation,'' ``certain central 
capabilities,'' that is the ``system capability'' 
[Systemfaehigkeit] must be preserved. 
  According to Ruehe, this includes the state's technological 
capability to produce a number of different types of weapons, 
including aircraft, helicopters, tanks, submarines, and modern 
ammunition. 
  The minister believes that the system capability is in 
danger 
because of the ``reduced demand'' for weapons in Germany and 
NATO. Moreover, industry ``is being restricted because it has to 
observe tight export regulations,'' which are accepted by the 
cooperation partners in other NATO states to a decreasing 
extent. A ``new approach'' is required. All partners must 
change, ``including ourselves.'' 
  The lobbyists are increasing their pressure. They are urging 
the chancellor and the coalition to water down the existing 
export guidelines. 
  The budget for procurement, research, and development of the 
Bundeswehr has declined to about 40 percent of the 1990 volume. 
  The number of jobs in the defense industry has dropped by 50 
percent. According to the National Association of German 
Industries, only 10 to 20 percent of the manufacturing 
capacities that existed in the year 1989, when the GDR 
collapsed, will survive until 1995. 
  The Bavarians in particular are sounding the alarm. They see 
a danger to the defense industry in their country. The weekend 
before last [11-12 December], Bavaria's Economics Minister Otto 
Wiesheu convened an emergency summit with representatives of 
weapons companies, budget and defense politicians. 
  Arms exports must be ``a major issue,'' Werner Heinzmann 
(German Aerospace company) stressed. He announced ``dramatic 
consequences'' for guided weapons and radar systems. 
  Gerhard Haas (Krauss-Maffei company) warned against 
``immense 
problems'' concerning Germany's competitiveness. The degree of 
utilization of his enterprise has declined by 60 percent in five 
years. Helmut Wiesner (Siemens) spoke of a ``shock'' because of 
the budget cuts. ``There has been no planning basis for the 
past four years.'' 
  The summit described the Foreign Ministry as the main 
barrier 
for future businesses. Klaus Kinkel and his diplomats still 
cling to the old principles for the export of war weapons 
adopted in 1982. They allow: 
  -- Exports to NATO countries without restrictions; 
  -- Exports to states outside NATO only if the ``internal 
situation of the countries'' is stable, and if the delivery does 
not contribute to ``increasing existing tensions,'' and if the 
arms are only intended for the countries' own defense. 
  -- Consultations with the government are imperative before 
joint projects with foreign companies can be exported to 
non-NATO countries. 
  In addition, the export of certain goods that are mentioned 
in a special list is subject to permission. They include 
nuclear reactors, chemicals, biological agents, or software of 
strategic significance (dual-use goods), such as computers or 
radio sets that can be used both for military and civilian 
purposes. The supply of subcontractor products for weapons 
companies is subject to a permission if the recipients are 
classified as sensitive on the H- list. The list mentions 33 
countries, including China, Cuba, Israel, and Vietnam. 
  Kinkel has so far been proud of his reservation. At the 
Federal Security Council, where decisions are made, ``I am alone 
on the bench. The five others are against me.'' The pressure 
by the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union 
[CDU/CSU] and the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] is 
increasing. 
  During his tour of Asia in the fall, the defense minister 
from the CDU acted as an enthusiastic weapons lobbyist. South 
Korea should be treated in the same way as the ASEAN states, he 
demanded. Unrestricted export of weapons should be allowed to 
this country, just like to the NATO countries. He has scored an 
initial success: The Federal Security Council approved the 
export of 120-millimeter-smooth-bore guns. 
  During his visit to Thailand, Ruehe noted ``great interest 
in 
German weapons technology.'' Saudi Arabia has wanted to buy 
Leopard-2 tanks for two years, State Secretary Joerg Schoenbohm 
added. 
  As far as the former East Bloc countries Poland, Hungary, 
and 
the Czech Republic are concerned, Ruehe sees ``the need to 
reconsider our positions.'' These states, which are members of 
the NATO Cooperation Council, should be given the same status as 
the NATO states, Ruehe wrote in his letter to the chancellor. 
Above all, they are interested in tanks. 
  The defense minister would like to revise the H-list. Israel 
(``an interesting cooperation partner'') and ``in a similar 
form'' Egypt could be deleted. The former FDP Economics 
Minister Juergen Moellemann would like to remove Taiwan from the 
H-list. Only then would German companies stand a chance to 
participate in the $200-billion investments, he told the 
chancellor. 
  A summit on a new overall concept, demanded by Ruehe, has 
not 
yet been held. Yet the officials from the Foreign and Economics 
Ministries have internally prepared the ``adaptation to the 
standards of the Western competitors.'' 
  Thus, the ``principles'' adopted in 1982 should be 
interpreted in a more generous way, and commercial and 
government projects with foreign partners should ``largely be 
treated in the same way,'' that is they should no longer be 
controlled. 
  Just in time for Christmas, the Federal Government has given 
a present. In a meeting of senior officials at the Chancellor's 
Office last week, the German position for the talks on 
harmonization within the European Union was determined: The 
tight German export control regulations for goods that can be 
used for military and civilian purposes is to be relaxed. At 
the Brussels Council of Foreign Ministers at the beginning of 
this week, the Germans want to agree to the compromise proposed 
by Belgium. 
  In the future, the export of dual-use goods that are not 
explicitly mentioned in the H-list will only be subject to 
permission in two areas: Subcontractor goods for weapons of 
mass destruction or booster rockets, but not for conventional 
arms projects. Thus, numerous exports to China or Iran will no 
longer be controlled in the future. 
  It is still unclear what will happen if an exporter knows 
that weapons are delivered to a country of the European Union 
but from there to another country. Supported by France and 
Great Britain, Germany demands an obligatory permit, whereas the 
European Commission views this as a major interference in the 
free single market. 
  Whereas Kohl suggested a tough attitude, the exports 
recommended the chancellor to ``show flexibility'' in the 
interests of Europe, if need be. 
  They are aware that accepting the proposal would involve 
``painful changes in the current German control practices.''
