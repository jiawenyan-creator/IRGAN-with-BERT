  [Text] The national secretariat of the Cuban Workers 
Federation [CTC] has agreed to conduct an in-depth analysis of 
the causes of the current nationwide shortage of work shoes, and 
discussed the feasibility of investing the hard currency used by 
enterprises to buy shoes abroad in national factories. 
  During the meeting, chaired by CTC Secretary General Pedro 
Ross Leal, it was reported that operations at the largest work 
shoe factory, located in Granma, are being affected by the lack 
of electricity, although the necessary raw materials are 
available. The CTC national secretariat acknowledged the work 
done by Granma Province, and pointed out that the metallurgy 
sector has grown 16 percent in the first quarter of 1994 and has 
reduced losses by 16 million pesos.
