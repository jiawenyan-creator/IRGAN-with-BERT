FT  24 JUN 94 / Steel to stand down as MP
Sir David Steel, the former Liberal leader, announced last night that he
would be standing down as an MP at the next general election.
He told his local constituency association that he would not contest the
seat of Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale again and would contemplate 'doing
something equally constructive and challenging with the remaining decades of
my working life'.
Sir David, 56, has probably been the most active and outstanding Liberal MP
over the past two decades. He said yesterday that he would be relinquishing
the post of foreign affairs spokesman for his party at the end of the
current session of parliament to concentrate on his role as head of the
Liberal International.
One factor influencing the MP's decision is that the boundaries of his
constituency are due to be changed drastically in a forthcoming review.
Sir David acknowledged last night that the changes would pose no serious
problem for his Liberal Democrat successor in a seat which will remain a
straight fight between the Liberal Democrat and Conservative candidates.
However, much of the new territory in the constituency will have a strong
Labour following. 'Time and effort will be required to convince former
Labour voters of the political realities in their new home, where the Labour
vote is small,' he said last night. 'Frankly it makes every sense for this
to be undertaken by a new and younger candidate.'
Sir David, Liberal leader from 1976 to 1988, first entered parliament in
March 1965.
In 1967 he piloted a landmark reform of the abortion law through parliament.
From 1977 to 1979 his party sustained the Labour government in a
parliamentary agreement.
In the 1980s he steered his party into an alliance with the Social
Democratic party. They later fought two elections under the Alliance banner,
and Sir David once famously told activists to 'go back to your
constituencies and prepare for government'.
