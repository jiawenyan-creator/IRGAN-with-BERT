FT  01 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Asda rises on MFI hopes
one of the biggest percentage rises in the market yesterday - following
reports that furniture group MFI will seek a stock market quotation. Asda
retained a 25 per cent stake when MFI was sold off to its management in
1987. Trading volume in Asda shares jumped to 30m, making it the most active
stock of the day.
Written down in Asda's books to zero the MFI holding now clearly now has
significant value, which market estimates put at Pounds 30m to Pounds 60m.
Analysts pointed out that MFI makes no money at the pre-tax level, because
of high interest payments, but will benefit from the injection of cash when
the shares are floated.
Thorn-EMI ahead
The decision by Thorn-EMI to withdraw from electrical retailing was welcomed
in the market. The group gained 15 to 841p in exceptional volume of 2.4m.
The rationalisation of Thorn's loss-making Rumbelows division, involving the
loss of 800 jobs, will reportedly cost the company around Pounds 46m. Ms
Jane Anscombe at BZW described the share price rise as one of 'relief'. She
added: 'This is only slightly good news for Thorn. They still have a lot of
work to do. We remain a hold.'
Hotels firmer
Reports that hotel group Forte has been contacting City analysts, arguing
that the sector has bottomed out, helped some stock yesterday. The market
has been waiting for signs of recovery, but most of the news this week had
continued to undermine the sector. Kleinwort Benson reported dismal
occupancy figures, particularly in London, and brewery group Vaux yesterday
said that its hotel business remains depressed.
However, some of the more positive sentiment rubbed off yesterday with the
sector showing some resilience after a dull week. Forte gained 2 to 227 1/2
p in busy volume of 2.6m, while Ladbroke added 4 1/2 to 214p. Granada Group
rose 5 to 224p on continued optimism over BSkyB. Vaux rose 7 to 216p on
well-received results.
Dealing in Rolls-Royce stock shares first advanced 4 on suggestions that
replacement part sales were recovering.
However, news that Trans World Airlines had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
in the US sent the shares into retreat. TWA had placed an engine order for
20 Airbus A330 aircraft that were to be powered by Rolls engines and were
due for delivery in 1994. The shares retreated to end a penny lower at 144
1/2 p as turnover soared to 11m.
Mr Nick Cunningham at Strauss Turnbull said: 'This underlies the insecure
nature of the civil aerospace order book.'
The honeymoon continued for Rank Organisation after its well-received
results. The shares added 31 to 671p following a 45p gain on Thursday.
Volume was a busy 2.4m.
Reflection on the results failed to draw a consensus on the leisure group's
prospects. BZW, a bull on the stock, believe Rank still holds 'good value'
at its present price and the gains made will be sustained. A more cautious
Hoare Govett has worries on Rank's holiday business, but remains supportive
in the short-term.
Holiday group Eurocamp slipped a further 4 to 311p as profit-taking
continued.
Brent Walker won official approval for the lease of 734 public houses from
Allied Lyons. However, it emerged later that the move would not allow Allied
to discount the pubs from the total it must sell under government
regulations. One analyst said the development could put the deal in
jeopardy. Brent added 2 to 14p, while Allied gained 6 to 649p.
Business services group Hays was heavily traded after Warburg Securities
bought 15.8m shares at 178p. They were placed with between 12 and 15
investors, who already had stakes in Hays, at 180p in a bought deal. Dealers
said there was speculation that a large stakeholder had sold its holding.
The placing represents 4.1 per cent of the company and the shareholders
capable of selling a stake of that size are the Kuwait Investment Office and
the British Coal Pension Fund. The shares firmed a penny to 188p.
Publisher Reed International came under pressure after Kleinwort Benson cut
its profit forecasts for the company. The shares lost 11 to 523p with 3.6m
traded. The house cut its figure for the year to end March 1992 by Pounds 5m
to Pounds 215m and for 1992/93 by Pounds 20m to Pounds 250m.
Reuters continued firm on optimism over the trials on its new dealing
systems and overnight firmness in New York. The shares were 40 up at one
stage and closed 28 better at 1128p.
Bear raiding returned to BTR which lost 10 to 417p. The persistent story
that chief executive Mr Alan Jackson may have to resign through ill health
resurfaced.
Guinness rose 14 to 570 having earlier hit a record 579p, after securities
house Nomura reinforced its buy recommendation.
A line of 5.5m BAT shares dealt at 645p and said to be part of a tax-related
'bed-and-breakfast' deal boosted turnover. The stock also saw active two-way
business following a press article which was positive on the prospects for
tobacco companies. BATs rose 4 to 662p with a massive 14m traded.
Wellcome was affected by a bear squeeze and the shares rose 21 to 1149p on
thin volume.
Prudential lost 3 to 131p on worries about the effect of proposed tax
changes on its US subsidiary Jackson National.
Oils were weak as caution persisted ahead of the forthcoming Opec production
meeting and the UN-Iraq meeting shortly. There was also said to be stock
overhanging the market. Shell lost 3 1/2 to 476 1/2 p.
Pre-press printing specialist Wace Group dived 64 to 104p as concern
resurfaced about possible links with the IRA after the resignation of the
managing director.
British Aerospace added 7 to 285p on turnover of 4.9m after the company
announced the sale of an aircraft components-making unit for Pounds 47m.
TI Group fell 11 to 597p after broker Williams De Broe criticised the
company's accounting methods.
From today's issue, the FT's London Share Service will carry Investment
Trust share prices in two separate categories. Those companies designated as
investment trusts by the UK Inland Revenue under rule 842 of the Income and
Corporation Tax Act 1988 - all those shown under the Investment Trusts
heading in the past - will be printed under the heading Investment Trusts -
Authorised.
A second category, Investment Trusts - unauthorised, will contain 56
companies until now listed under the Other Financials heading. Initially,
daily net asset values estimated by County NatWest WoodMac will be shown for
seven of these companies. In time, it is hoped to provide net asset values
for all this category.
