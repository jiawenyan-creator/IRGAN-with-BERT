FT  24 MAR 94 / Swedish output shows recovery: Economic Watch
Further evidence that Sweden's toughest recession for 50 years ended during
1993 emerged yesterday when the latest industrial production figures showed
growth of 8.4 per cent in the year to January, with production rising by 0.8
per cent in January over December. Recovery has been strongest in the
mining, engineering and manufacturing sectors, but the big paper and pulp
industry has shown a fall in output. Figures from the Riksbank also showed
the strength of the surge in exports that is driving the recovery. Exports
were up by 29 per cent in January, over January 1993, producing a trade
surplus of SKr7.5bn (Pounds 640m) for the month. But heavy debt servicing
meant the current account was in deficit to the tune of SKr4.7bn. The
current account deficit for the 12-month period to January was SKr3.5bn.
