<F P=106> [Letter to the editor by former Foreign Minister Thanat </F>
Khoman; from the "Post Bag" column] 
  [Text] Sir: I am surprised and disgusted to see an 
ambassador, in this case US Ambassador Lambertson, treat 
Thailand as if it were an American colony. Who does he think he 
is? A satrap of an American emperor? Or a "gauleiter" of a new 
Hitler? As a diplomatist, he did not learn about the "comitas 
gentium" (I hope he understands what these words mean.) 
  Do knock it into your head, Mr Ambassador that contacts 
between Thailand and the Khmer Rouge, much to our displeasure 
started at the time when communist Vietnam invaded and 
militarily occupied Cambodia. At that time, the US was nowhere 
to be seen, probably hiding its head in the sands suffering from 
the Vietnam syndrome. And the contacts were meant to help repel 
the Vietnamese. There is no kinship between Thais and Khmer 
Rouge who are a product of French culture. 
  As to the sanctions against Thai companies dealing with 
Libya, suffice it to say that it is by no means proved that 
those so-called plants would serve to build chemical weapons. 
It is in fact an American assumption to show its power and 
dominate the world. In any case, who appoints the US to be 
judge and arbiter -- or simply international "cops"? If the US 
continues to behave like this, sooner or later and sooner rather 
than later, according to the Law of Karma, it will have to pay 
for its wanton and egregious behaviour. There will be more 
floods, more earthquakes and hurricanes descending upon that 
land, causing destruction and sufferings to its people who do 
not deserve the punishment for the crimes of their leaders. 
[Signed] Thanat Khoman, Bangkok
