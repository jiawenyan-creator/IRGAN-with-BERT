FT  17 APR 93 / Books: Liverpool - the quick and the dead
'ABOVE ALL, pay attention to life,' wrote Henri Cartier-Bresson who, along
with Robert Capa, was a founding member of Magnum Photos in 1947. It has
been an edict to which Peter Marlow, the agency's president now, has
subscribed faithfully; his previous work has recorded the conflict and
suffering in war zones and refugee camps around the world.
Between assignments abroad, Marlow returned periodically throughout the
1980s to photograph the people and buildings of Liverpool. The cumulative
result is a powerful social document, Liverpool: Looking Out To Sea, now
showing at The Photographers' Gallery in London and also published by
Jonathan Cape (Pounds 35/Pounds 20, 111 pages).
Marlow's achievement is to penetrate the humanity behind Liverpool's media
image with an admirably unsentimental style that accommodates both the
artless, snapshot aesthetic of social landscape photography and more
painterly, chiaroscuro prints, such as those of men and boys scavenging in
rubbish dumps.
Never shy of the grand gesture (one of his contributions to the Hayward
Gallery's Magnum retrospective three years ago showed a US soldier grieving
before Washington's Vietnam war memorial, here echoed by a fan mourning the
Hillsborough victims), Marlow's ennobling, luminous tones inject a measure
of sympathy for a city once fat on the imperial plenty of the slave trade.
And, amid this wasteland, a river runs through it. Marlow points constantly
to the Mersey's embarrassed, disconsolate presence as a metaphor for the
city's decay and disuse. Empty of the ships that brought Liverpool wealth,
the only vessels to break its monotonous expanse are half-full ferries and a
Sunday afternoon yacht race where a white marker flag offers up a symbol of
surrender.
