VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME; 
PARK PLAN SENT BACK FOR STUDY, REVISIONS 
After heated public discussion, the Port Hueneme City Council returned a 
10-year, $3-million parks and recreation master plan to city staff and 
consultants for further study and revision. 
The plan outlines park landscaping, lighting, restroom installation and other 
redesign projects for the city's parklands. 
More than 100 5- and 6-year-olds, many of whom attended the meeting in their 
Little League uniforms, came to protest plans to move a temporary ball field 
from Bubbling Springs Park. The young ballplayers use the field between March 
and July. 
The plan called for relocation of the field to another site, away from a 
concession stand. 
The move was proposed to combat parking and overcrowding problems at the park, 
and as a solution to the safety hazard posed by palm trees in the outfield. 
"I understand parents play tree guard," said Wallace, Roberts and Todd 
consultant Paul Rookood. 
"We put in a lot of hours," said Little League President Don Overholt of the 
volunteers who run the program. "We don't see them decide to just come in and 
take it away." 
Overholt was happy with the council's decision to reconsider. "They made some 
good recommendations and some good points," he said. 
Parks and Recreation Director Brady Cherry was also pleased with the delay. 
"I think that I really was asking the City Council to do too much," Cherry 
said. Council members received the document less than a week ago, Cherry said. 
"I feel they needed time to study the plan," Cherry said. "I did not change my 
recommendation." 
Changes will be made and the plan will be submitted to the council after the 
results of two other studies -- one on area child care and one on the 
feasibility of building an RV park on Port Hueneme Beach. Cherry said the 
studies should be complete by the end of the summer. KIM KASH
