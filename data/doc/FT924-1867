FT  16 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Mongolia's credit rating put at risk over
debt to Japanese
THE Mongolian government is under increasing pressure to repay an instalment
on a Japanese government-backed Y8bn (Pounds 42m) loan for a steel mill
project that threatens to undermine its international credit rating.
Should it fail to repay about Y1bn, due yesterday, Japan, which takes a
tough line on non-repayment, is likely to increase trade insurance costs for
dealing with Mongolia, now taking tentative steps towards developing new
industries.
Funds were provided two years ago by the Export-Import Bank of Japan to buy
steel equipment through Itochu, the Japanese trading house, which must repay
the funds to the bank and is waiting on Mongolia.
Itochu said last night 'we are not yet worried', although Mongolia is
reported to be having difficulty raising the hard-currency. Reports suggest
payments have been delayed to Russian workers on the site at Darkhan, in the
north.
'We are in contact with our Mongolian office and we will not be uneasy
unless there is a delay for half a year or more. Even though Mongolia has
difficulties, they can afford to pay this money,' the trading house said.
Itochu has taken out trade insurance with the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry, which said that 'there should be no problem if the
payment delay is not too long'.
If Mongolia is unable to pay, the Japanese government will be put in an
awkward position, as it has taken a lead in encouraging the country's
development since its emergence from Moscow's political influence.
Mongolia relies heavily on help from Japan, which has indicated that it will
provide Dollars 50m in credits for a range of projects including a coal
mine, infrastructure development and a textile plant.
