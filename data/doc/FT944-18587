FT  03 OCT 94 / Company News (This Week): Sharp upturn hope for Hewden
Stuart - Other Companies
Sir Matthew Goodwin, chairman of Hewden Stuart, can be relied on to give an
insight into the state of the construction industry when he reports interim
results on Wednesday. The Glasgow-based company is the UK's biggest
independent plant hire group and is involved in every sector, from
housebuilding to roads and industrial projects. Analysts expect a sharp
increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31, from Pounds 9.1m
to about Pounds 13.5m. Interest will focus on the trading outlook and what
returns have been made from the Hireplant assets of BET - 24,00 items of
plant and 29 freehold properties which Hewden Stuart snapped up for a mere
Pounds 11m last year.
