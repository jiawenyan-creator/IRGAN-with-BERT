SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA; 
SAN LUIS BARRIERS TO REMAIN 
Temporary barricades installed on San Luis Street in April to discourage 
drive-by shootings will remain in place for another 90 days while residents 
consider other ways to deal with a gang problem. 
The City Council this week heard from residents on San Luis Street who wanted 
the barriers made permanent, and from residents on two neighboring streets who 
objected because of added traffic on their streets. 
Linda Bustos, who urged the temporary closure in April after a series of five 
drive-by shootings, said there have been no shootings since. "I'm for keeping 
the street closed because I feel safe," she said. But residents on adjacent San 
Rafael and San Felipe streets said it is impractical to close every street 
where shootings occur and that closures create traffic problems elsewhere. 
Robert DeLoach, city public works director, recommended against closing the 
street permanently because of the cost, estimated at $60,000, and the impact on 
other streets.
