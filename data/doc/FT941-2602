FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Fall in world's emerging stock

south east Asia as investors' favourites - though some individual markets
bucked the declining trend. Michael Hughes, of BZW, said that although the
emerging markets bubble has not burst, there has been a clear change in
attitude by investors.
