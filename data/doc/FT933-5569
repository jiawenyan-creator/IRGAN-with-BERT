FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Nissan's Spanish unit plunges
NISSAN Motor Iberica, the majority-owned Spanish subsidiary of the Japanese
carmaker, plunged to a pre-tax loss of Pta23,084bn (Dollars 172m) in the
first half of the year from a loss of Pta2.7bn in the same period a year
ago.
The heavy losses are expected to force Nissan to inject more equity capital
later this year into the troubled Spanish group, in which it currently holds
a 70.3 per cent stake.
Nissan injected Pta5bn in July, but the company has indicated that it may
have to put in a further Pta10bn in two tranches in order to bolster the
Spanish group's balance sheet.
Nissan Motor Iberica's sales volume fell by 7 per cent to 46,424 vehicles
from 49,840 a year earlier, while group turnover declined by 8.2 per cent to
Pta79.1bn (Pta86.3bn).
The company's finances have come under acute pressure under the impact of
the sharp fall in new vehicle sales in Spain and across Europe, which has
coincided with heavy capital investments by the Japanese vehicle maker in
Spain in new production capacity and in the development of new models.
Nissan, which is in loss worldwide, is seeking to transform its Spanish
operations from their traditional role as a maker of light and medium duty
commercial vehicles chiefly for the domestic market into a producer of niche
passenger vehicles - the Serena multi-purpose vehicle and the Terrano
II/Ford Maverick four-wheel-drive leisure utility vehicle - to be sold
across Europe.
The Terrano II was only launched in May, and overall Nissan Motor Iberica
production fell in the first half of the year by 13.5 per cent to 36,007
from 41,607 in the same period a year ago.
By the end of June the workforce had been cut to 7,005 from 7,228 a year
earlier.
