FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Saga Petroleum to raise NKr600m
SAGA PETROLEUM, Norway's biggest independent oil company, is planning to
issue up to 7m new shares which could raise NKr600m (Dollars 93m), the
company confirmed yesterday.
Mr John Sandberg, a Saga executive, said the board would meet soon to agree
details of the planned capital increase.
The new capital would be used for acquisitions within the oil sector, Mr
Sandberg said. Last autumn, Saga said it was seeking international
expansion.
Mr Sandberg said Saga's board would seek authority to issue the shares from
the general assembly at a meeting scheduled for May 7. Yesterday, Saga's
A-shares closed unchanged at NKr73 in Oslo.
Last year, Saga held talks about acquiring the Norwegian North Sea oil and
gas assets of DNO, a small oil company connected with Mr Torstein Hagen, the
Norwegian financier. The talks, however, foundered on the valuation of DNO's
assets.
In August, Saga will bring its first oilfield, Snorre, on stream in two
phases. Investment in the entire development is about NKr30bn, NKr21bn of
which will cover the first phase development.
Snorre contains 106m standard cubic metres of oil, 6.7bn cubic metres of gas
and 3.2m tonnes of natural gas liquids.
The company is also developing another oil field, Tordis, which is much
smaller than Snorre with oil reserves of 18m standard cubic metres of oil.
The field, slated to come on stream in the second half of 1994, will cost
NKr3bn to develop.
Saga is also studying development alternatives for the Vigdis oilfield,
which it declared commercial last October.
