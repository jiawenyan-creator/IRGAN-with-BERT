FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Chase pays Dollars 348m for
mortgage bank
Chase Manhattan has announced an agreement to pay Dollars 348m for American
Residential, a California-based mortgage bank, in a move that it said would
make Chase one of the top five US home loan institutions.
The deal marks a continuation of Chase's ambition to grow specialised
nationwide financial services units, for instance in home mortgages and
credit cards. It is also likely to prompt an acceleration in the takeover of
mortgage lenders, given the declared intention of some of the country's
biggest commercial banks to expand their involvement in the business.
In recent days, NationsBank had also been talked of as a possible bidder for
American Residential, helping to push up the company's share price ahead of
the Chase announcement. In May, Chemical Banking announced a Dollars 330m
purchase of Margaretten, a New Jersey-based institution.
Mr Richard Rosenberg, chairman and chief executive of BankAmerica, said
before the Chase announcement that the California-based bank was more likely
to expand through the acquisition of specialised institutions such as
mortgage banks than through purchases of full-scale commercial banks.
Although mortgage banks in the US have suffered from rising interest rates
which have brought an end to last year's record refinancing and new loan
business, they remain attractive sources of fee income for banks.
