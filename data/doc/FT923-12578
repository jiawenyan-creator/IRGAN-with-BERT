FT  17 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Wellcome
Like many good ideas, the share swap proposed for the Wellcome sale is so
obvious that one wonders why it was not thought of before. By taking
something over Pounds 500m of stock for Wellcome shares, the Trust will
reduce its dealing costs and will instantly acquire a UK equity portfolio
without carrying the market risk of being in cash while building it up. At
the same time, other fund managers will be galvanised by the prospect of
unloading awkward bundles of stock at mid-market prices, although it will
doubtless be the job of BZW on the Trust's behalf to frustrate them.
The effect on market stability should be minor, if positive. The UK part of
the sale was always likely to be an intra-market affair, with institutions
selling equities to buy Wellcome and the Trust then buying equities with the
proceeds. The main losers are BZW's rivals, who will see none of the
business. But that is competitive broking for you.
