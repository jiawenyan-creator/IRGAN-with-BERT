  [Text] Israel and the Vatican this morning officially 
announced the establishment of full diplomatic relations and the 
setting up of embassies. Under the agreement signed yesterday, 
two joint committees -- one economic and the other judicial -- 
would be set up. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, in announcing 
diplomatic 
relations with the Vatican, said he believes the idea of 
dividing Jerusalem up into boroughs while maintaining a single 
municipal authority would be raised in the negotiations with the 
Palestinians. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir asked the deputy 
minister if the Vatican responded to Foreign Minister Peres' 
letter to the Norwegian foreign minister on Jerusalem. The 
Likud views it as strengthening the assumption that 
responsibility for the Christian and Muslim holy places in 
Jerusalem would be handed over to the Palestinians. Beilin said 
that the Vatican did not refer to the Peres letter, but asked to 
be a partner to all negotiations on the Jerusalem holy places.
