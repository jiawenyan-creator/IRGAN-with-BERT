IN BRIEF; 
GRACE TO EXPAND CHEMICAL BUSINESS 
W. R. Grace &amp; Co., the leading U.S. maker of specialty chemicals, said 
today that it plans to sell minority stakes in its far-flung specialty units 
and energy holdings to generate funds to expand its profitable chemical 
business. 
The New York-based company expects the sales to generate at least $300 million, 
a spokesman said. Grace's specialty businesses include cocoa, specialty 
textiles and specialty agricultural activities. 
Grace, which has sold $2 billion in assets in the last two years, said it is 
considering the partial sale of a minority interest in Grace Specialty 
Businesses and the sale of a minority stake in Grace Natural Resources Group. 
Grace said it would use proceeds from these sales to support both its core 
specialty chemical business -- which has high capital requirements -- and its 
nonspecialty chemical business in a restructuring that hopes to boost 1989 
profits. 
Grace has been shedding businesses to improve profits and to thwart potential 
takeover attempts. The conglomerate focuses on specialty chemicals, natural 
resources, specialty businesses and chemicals.
