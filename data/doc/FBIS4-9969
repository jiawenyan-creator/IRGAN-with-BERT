  [Text] Buenos Aires, 4 Apr (NA) -- Interior Minister Carlos 
Ruckauf on 4 April ruled out the possibility of government 
intervention in Jujuy Province "for now." 
  Ruckauf said: "The situation in Jujuy is very complex, but 
it 
is not a province with structural problems. Therefore, for now, 
there will be no federal measures." 
  The minister made these remarks shortly before attending a 
dinner that Carlos Corach, the Justicialist Party's No. 1 
candidate for Constituent Assembly member for the federal 
capital, hosted for 600 entrepreneurs at the Alvear Palace Hotel 
in this capital.
