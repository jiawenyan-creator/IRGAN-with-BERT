FT  13 MAY 94 / Observer: Best game in town
One notable absentee from Bonn over the past two days, while Boris Yeltsin
and company have been having fun with Helmut Kohl, was Volker Ruhe,
Germany's normally gregarious defence minister.
Although his Russian opposite number, Pavel Grachov, was in the Yeltsin
entourage, Ruhe left town for a a meeting with the Danish and Polish defence
ministers at Rostock, on the Baltic coast.
It was left to his state secretary, Jorg Schonbohm, to play host, and take
part in the ticklish talks about how and when the Russian troops will exit
east Germany.
There was ugly talk of a diplomatic snub. Not so, says Ruhe: 'It's just that
I am not a man to break my prior engagements.' But Observer has heard an
alternative tale which might explain his absence. The wiry Grachov, an
ex-paratrooper, wanted to chall-enge his rival to a game of tennis. The wily
Ruhe left the court to Schonbohm, another tough soldier, rather than risk
losing.
