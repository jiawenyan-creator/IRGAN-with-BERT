FT  22 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Japan
Yesterday's three-quarter point cut in interest rates suggests the Bank of
Japan was distinctly under-whelmed by the latest economic package from
government. Whether taking another slice off interest rates will do any more
than last week's modest fiscal stimulus to halt the slide in the real
economy remains open to question. If savings rates are reduced in line with
the discount rate, cash should - in theory - be squeezed out into
consumption. But there has been scant evidence of that effect in the three
years since interest rates started to fall. With talk of job cuts starting
to circulate among recession-hit Japanese companies, consumers may feel less
like spending than ever.
There may be more chance of reversing the trend of asset price deflation,
especially in property. As in the US, that, combined with a steeply sloping
yield curve, would help restore the position of the banks. But the US
experience underlines that healthy banks are necessary but not a sufficient
condition for recovery. While domestic demand is weak and exporters are
priced out of overseas markets by the strength of the yen, there are few
reasons for optimism. The faint weakness of the Japanese currency yesterday
is a minor consolation.
