  [Excerpt] Speaking to newsmen at Bina Graha [presidential 
office] in Jakarta today, Murdiono, minister/state secretary, 
said Indonesia feels that Japanese politics is mature enough 
that the change in its premiership will not affect the previous 
government's commitment. 
  Murdiono expressed shock upon hearing the news of Japanese 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's decision to undertake the mass 
resignation of his cabinet. However, he said that what is 
important to Indonesia is to see that the new Japanese 
Government's national policies remain the same. [passage omitted]
