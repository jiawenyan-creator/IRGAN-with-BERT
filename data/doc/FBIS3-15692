  [Text] Riga, 5 Mar -- An agreement on this year's gas 
supplies was reached between Latvia and the Russian Gazprom 
today. Their volume will remain on the same level and the price 
for 1,000 cubic meters will be $78, which is more than Lithuania 
and Estonia will be paying. Moscow representatives also visited 
Estonia this week. 
  According to Adrians Davis, the general director of Latvijan 
Gaze, the neighbors received a price reduction because of the 
fact that Estonia has set up a joint venture with Lentransgaz, 
in which the Russian partner has more than 30 percent of shares 
was taken into account. 
  Lithuania is also preparing for a similar step. Latvia, for 
the time being, is contemplating whether it should share 
property. 
  At the same time Davis said that compared with other 
countries Latvia was regarded as a relatively safe customer. It 
will pay off its debt of $23 million by next week. There is 
also a government decision to grant funds using the credit from 
the Japanese Export-Import Bank. 
  In the opinion of the general director of Latvijan Gaze, the 
talks were successful. He particularly mentioned the prospects 
for signing a long-term treaty for 10-15 years, which was 
extremely important for Latvia.
