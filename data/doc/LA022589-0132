SPOTLIGHT: SAN MATEO CANYON WILDERNESS 
Description: One of 23 wilderness areas established by the California 
Wilderness Act of 1984, San Mateo Canyon is a relatively untouched wilderness 
of steep canyon country sculpted by seasonal streams. Elevations range from 500 
to 3,000 feet. The vegetation is primarily mixed chaparral with occasional oak 
woodlands; sycamore and alder interspersed with oaks and ferns can be found in 
some canyon bottoms. 
Location: The 39,540-acre wilderness is in the southern portion of the Trabuco 
Ranger District of the Cleveland National Forest, and includes portions of 
Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties. 
Entry: The nearest entry point to Orange County is at Bear Canyon, off the 
Ortega Highway just past Upper San Juan Campround (see map). There is a parking 
lot there, with signs pointing to local trails. 
Activities: Mechanized vehicles (including bicycles) are not allowed within the 
wilderness area. Hiking and horseback riding are allowed on an extensive trail 
system in the wilderness, and remote camping is permitted with certain 
restrictions (camping is not allowed within 100 feet of streams, springs and 
meadows). Hunting is allowed with a valid license, but target shooting is not 
permitted. 
Wilderness permits: Entry permits are required for overnight trips into the 
wilderness. The permit is free and can be obtained at the Trabuco Ranger 
District Headquarters in Corona or at any of the Forest Service Fire Stations 
throughout the district. Permits can also be obtained by mail or by phone at 
(714) 736-1811. Day use of the wilderness does not require a permit. 
Regulations: A list of camping and other regulations is available from the 
Forest Service through the number listed above.
