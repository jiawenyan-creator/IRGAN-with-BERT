 



Comment: 

Seven commenters requested that the final rule clarify what is meant by residential supervision. The commenters
stated that they did not want PHAs to use residential supervision to provide a more restrictive type of public housing
for persons with disabilities. 



Response: 

``Residential supervision'' refers to the assistance provided by a person or persons who either lives at the designated
project for disabled families, or makes himself or herself available to persons with disabilities who may need assistance
on a 24-hour or on-call basis. Generally, residential supervision assistance is provided to persons who, as a result
of seizures or paralysis, for example, may need assistance to be provided on a flexible basis (e.g., on-call) and to
be available within proximity to where the person resides. The specific need for residential supervision must be
documented in the supportive service plan. 




Section 945.303Requirements governing occupancy in designated housing 





Comment: 

One commenter requested that the final rule contain regulations to permit expedited removal of disruptive tenants.




Response: 

The Department's regulations in 24 CFR part 966, governing lease and grievance procedures in public housing, already
address this issue. 



Section 945.301Operating designated housing 






Comment: 

Two commenters stated that the requirement to operate designated housing in conformance with civil rights laws should
be extended to the allocation plan development stages. 



Response: 

The Department agrees with this comment, and this section of the final rule provides that ``the application procedures
and operation of designated projects'' shall be in conformity with the applicable civil rights and nondiscrimination
statutes. Conformity with applicable civil rights and nondiscrimination statutes includes submission of the needs
assessment and transition plan required by 24 CFR 8.25. 



Part 960, Subpart D_Preference for Disabled Families and Elderly Families in Public Housing Projects for Disabled
Families and Elderly Families 





Comment: 

One commenter stated that the proposed rule did not make clear that elderly housing under part 960 is not the same as
elderly housing under part 945. 



Response: 

The Department believes that the editorial changes made to part 960 in the final rule clarify the distinction between
projects meeting the requirements of part 945, and those meeting the requirements of part 960. 
For example, the Department has changed the title to subpart D to read ``Preferences for Elderly Families and Disabled
Families in Mixed Population Projects'' and uses this term ``mixed population project'' throughout the subpart
D. Use of the term ``mixed population project'' should clarify that projects meeting the requirements of subpart
D house both elderly families and disabled families. 



Comment: 

Six commenters stated that reference in 960.407 to the 10 percent limitation on families without a Federal
preference should be revised to read ``50 percent.'' 



Response: 

The Department has not yet issued its final regulation on Federal preferences. Once the Federal preferences final
rule is published, the Department will make a conforming amendment to part 960, subpart D to reflect the 50 percent.




Comments on the Information Collection Requirements 





Comment: 

Ten commenters stated that the Department grossly underestimated the time for completion of the allocation plan.




Response: 

The Department believes that the substantial changes made to the allocation plan requirements by this final rule
bring the plan more in line with the estimated burden hours. 




Other Comments and Recommendations 





Comment: 

Three commenters stated that they expect the most vigorous possible oversight by the Department of the allocation
planning process, not only at the first step of initial approval, but biennial updates. 



Response: 

The Department has every intention to monitor, through careful review of initial allocation plans and biennial updates,
the operation of designated housing, and its impact on families served by PHAs that operate designated housing. Monitoring
also will include monitoring and compliance reviews under section 504, investigations of complaints under section
504, the Fair Housing Act, and other civil rights authorities. 



Comment: 

Four commenters stated that the final rule should require PHAs to preserve some mixed-use or general occupancy housing
for persons with disabilities. 



Response: 

The Department certainly encourages, but cannot require, PHAs to maintain mixed-used or general occupancy projects
for persons with disabilities.
