KROC TO BE MORE ACTIVE UNTIL SALE IS FINISHED 
Joan Kroc, owner of the Padres, said Thursday that she will resume an active 
role in running the organization following Jerry Kapstein's resignation as the 
team's top executive. 
Kroc, who has signed a letter of intent to sell the team to a group headed by 
television producer Tom Werner, said she will devote more time to the club 
until the sale is completed. 
The deal must be approved at a meeting of major league owners June 12-13 in 
Cleveland. 
In a brief statement, Kroc said: "I have postponed my travel plans until the 
sale of the Padres is completed and the club is transferred to the new owners. 
"I will continue to be involved in the management of the organization and to 
cheer on our Padres at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium with my fellow fans." 
Kapstein resigned his post Wednesday, the same day it was reported that Kroc's 
daughter, Linda Smith, would seek a divorce from Kapstein following 18 months 
of marriage. 
Kroc had appointed Kapstein as the team's top executive in February, and he 
helped negotiate the recent $75 million sale of the team to a group headed by 
Werner, a Los Angeles resident.
