FT  16 SEP 93 / Croat relatives mourn over bodies in Prozor
Relatives of Croats killed in the village of Uzdol crying over bodies
yesterday in the town of Prozor. Croat military officials in Bosnia have
threatened to flatten Stari Vitez, an encircled Moslem enclave in the town
of Vitez, in retaliation for the apparent massacre by Moslems of more than
30 Croat villagers in Uzdol, UN sources say, Reuter reports.
Bosnian Croat leader Mate Boban declared a day of mourning for the
villagers, most of whom were said to have been civilians by reporters who
saw the bodies. 'The Croats. . . issued an ultimatum warning everyone in
Stari Vitez to vacate the area by noon or face the consequences,' a UN
worker in Vitez said.
Stari Vitez has been besieged by Croat forces for the past four months.
