FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Loss at Von Roll steel group
widens to SFr55m
VON ROLL, the Swiss steel group, said its loss widened in 1992 to SFr55m
(Dollars 36.7m) from SFr30m in 1991, and forecast a further loss this year.
'In 1993, we will be able to improve the operating result, but the delayed
start-up of our waste incinerator in the US, high restructuring costs at
foreign units of Von Roll Isola, and the unfavourable market for both our
Swiss steelworks, will lead to another negative result,' the directors
forecast.
Von Roll, in which Proventus of Sweden bought a 20 per cent stake in
December 1991, said virtually all of its business activities and important
markets suffered last year.
Turnover was down 8 per cent to SFr2.11bn.
Grands Magasins Jelmoli, the leading Swiss department store group, said
consolidated net profit was flat at SFr11m last year on sales up 2.6 per
cent to SFr1.55bn.
The group, 51 per cent owned by UTC International, said it was offering to
buy out minority shareholders of 60 per cent held Au Grand Passage and 55.3
per cent held Innovation through share exchanges.
