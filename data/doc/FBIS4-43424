  [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's new 
prime minister, has pledged that his government will respect the 
principles of liberty and tolerance. All types of racism and 
antisemitism must be consigned to the past, Berlusconi said in 
Bonn today at the start of his visit to Germany. He also 
pointed out that Italy and Germany currently face similar 
problems in areas such as unemployment, where a joint approach 
is needed. [passage omitted]
