FT  06 APR 94 / Observer: Waiting game
With Glenys Kinnock preparing for a famous victory in her rock-solid Labour
Euro constituency, husband Neil waits patiently (if only he could do the
same on motorways) to see if he might join her on the gravy train.
With a Labour replacement for Bruce Millan as a European Commissioner due in
January, a decision on his successor will have to be made soon by John
Major. Kinnock's name went forward for the Pounds 140,000 a year job after
the 1992 general election but Major dropped the idea as quickly as 'back to
basics' when his MPs threatened to explode.
John Smith, however, appears intent upon submitting the former Labour
leader's name yet again, though Major is not bound to accept it. If he does,
the prime minister can count on another row, first for having again changed
his European mind and secondly for taunting his Euro-sceptics with the
appointment of a man whose rabid enthusiasm for the European dream bears all
the hallmarks of a late convert.
At least the Tory Eurofanatics should have little to complain about, other
than their conviction that Kinnock is a Johnny-cum-
lately who would be hell-bent on stirring up trouble for the Tories in
Europe. That, of course, remains the prerogative of the Tory party.
