  [Text] Some 1.2 million companies now face the tough task 
of restructuring their business in line with the first Corporate 
Law which takes effect on Friday. 
  Adopted by the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress last December, it is seen as a key legislation on 
building a modern corporate system. 
  And the law will effect every company in China, said Bian 
Yaowu, of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPC Standing 
Committee. 
  He said existing companies will be scrutinized and the 
irregular ones will be given a period of time to regulate their 
practices and bring them under the norms of the law. 
  The State Council will decide on the time limit for the 
irregular companies to improve. 
  Bian did not disclose the number of the irregular companies 
in the country. He also did not give a clear answer whether the 
existing companies need to re-register. 
  The law, containing 11 chapters with 230 articles, oversees 
the establishment and organization of limited liability and 
shareholding companies, share issues and transfers, corporate 
bonds, corporate accounting, bankruptcy and mergers, foreign 
branches in China, and legal responsibility. 
  Bian said the law will provide a legal guarantee to all 
companies. And `company' in the law refers to limited liability 
and shareholding companies. 
  It also provides a legal basis for the State-owned 
enterprises to transform their operations and convert into 
companies. 
  Although a large percentage of state-owned enterprises will 
transform into companies, it is not a must for all state-owned 
enterprises to do so.
