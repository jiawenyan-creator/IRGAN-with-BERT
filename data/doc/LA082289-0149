GAS LINE BREAK CLOSES VENTURA BLVD. 
A one-block stretch of Ventura Boulevard was closed and about two dozen people 
were evacuated from businesses in Sherman Oaks this morning after a 
construction crew accidentally broke a natural gas line, the Los Angeles Fire 
Department reported. 
The two-inch gas pipe was broken at 8:45 a.m. at a construction excavation site 
in the 14200 block of Ventura Boulevard, said department spokesman Jim 
Williamson. Ventura Boulevard between Katherine and Calhoun avenues was closed, 
and employees and customers of two businesses on either side of the 
construction site were evacuated as a precaution. 
The gas line was capped at 9:40 a.m., Williamson said.
