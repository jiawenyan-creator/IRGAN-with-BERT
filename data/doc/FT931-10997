FT  05 FEB 93 / Talks on forcing Mobutu out
ZAIRE'S three main donor states, the US, Belgium and France, yesterday
discussed options for forcing Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko to end his
27-year monopoly on government and transfer 'all powers' to his rival, Prime
Minister Etienne Tshisekedi, agencies report from Brussels.
Mr Herman Cohen, US assistant secretary of state, and his French and Belgian
counterparts, Mr Jean de la Sabliere and Mr Wilfried Jaenen, met for more
than five hours.
Diplomats said they discussed several possibilities, including the freezing
of Mr Mobutu's assets in foreign countries, the expulsion of his ambassadors
and fewer visas for his officials.
Diplomats said the three countries would co-ordinate action toward Zaire
during a mid-February meeting of the International Monetary Fund in
Washington.
The three countries said on Wednesday that the recent bloody riots and
reprisals in the capital, Kinshasa, which resulted in hundreds of deaths,
were due to Mr Mobutu's refusal to co-operate with Mr Tshisekedi's
transitional government or to yield any authority.
