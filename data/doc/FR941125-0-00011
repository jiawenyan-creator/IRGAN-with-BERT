SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Rule 10b10 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires, among other things, that non-market maker brokers
and dealers disclose their mark-ups and mark-downs in riskless principal transactions in equity securities. This
disclosure requirement was adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1977 in Securities Exchange Act
Release No. 13508, and amended in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34962.



Need For Correction



The amendments to Rule 10b10 contain an error in the mark-up and mark-down disclosure requirements for riskless
principal transactions in equity securities. Specifically, the modifying term ``equity'' was omitted from (a)(2)(ii)(A)
of Rule 10b10. This disclosure requirement should apply solely to equity securities.



Correction of Publication



Accordingly, the publication on November 17, 1994 containing the adoption of amendments to Rule 10b10 which
were published in 59 FR 59612 is corrected as follows:



240.10b10 

[Corrected]



On page 59621, in the first column, 240.10b10, paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) in the second line, the word
``that'' is removed and the phrase ``an equity'' is added to precede the word ``security''.

On page 59621, in the first column, 240.10b10, paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) in the fifth line, the word ``equity''
is added to precede the word ``security''.
