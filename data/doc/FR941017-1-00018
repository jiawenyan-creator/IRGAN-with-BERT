 

2. Section 50.2 is amended by adding in alphabetical order the 
definitions for 

Committed dose equivalent, Committed effective dose 
equivalent, Deep-dose equivalent, Exclusion area, Low population zone, Safety-related structures, systems,
and components

 and 

Total effective dose 
equivalent 

to read as follows: 



50.2 



Definitions. 



* * * * * 





Committed dose equivalent 

means the dose equivalent to organs or 
tissues of reference that will be received from an intake of radioactive 
material by an individual during the 50-year period following the intake. 



Committed effective dose equivalent 

is the sum of the products of 
the weighting factors applicable to each of the body organs or tissues that 
are irradiated and the committed dose equivalent to these organs or tissues. 



* * * * * 





Deep-dose equivalent, 

which applies to external whole-body 
exposure, is the dose equivalent at a tissue depth of 1 cm (1000 mg/cm

2

).

Exclusion area

 means that area surrounding the reactor, in which 
the reactor licensee has the authority to determine all activities including 
exclusion or removal of personnel and property from the area. This area may 
be traversed by a highway, railroad, or waterway, provided these are not so 
close to the facility as to interfere with normal operations of the facility 
and provided appropriate and effective arrangements are made to control 
traffic on the highway, railroad, or waterway, in case of emergency, to 
protect the public health and safety. Residence within the exclusion area 
shall normally be prohibited. In any event, residents shall be subject to 
ready removal in case of necessity. Activities unrelated to operation of the 
reactor may be permitted in an exclusion area under appropriate limitations, 
provided that no significant hazards to the public health and safety will 
result. 



* * * * * 





Low population zone

 means the area immediately surrounding the 
exclusion area which contains residents, the total number and density of which 
are such that there is a reasonable probability that appropriate protective 
measures could be taken in their behalf in the event of a serious accident. 
These guides do not specify a permissible population density or total 
population within this zone because the situation may vary from case to case. 
Whether a specific number of people can, for example, be evacuated from a 
specific area, or instructed to take shelter, on a timely basis will depend on 
many factors such as location, number and size of highways, scope and extent 
of advance planning, and actual distribution of residents within the area. 



* * * * * 





Safety-related structures, systems, and components 

means those 
structures, systems, and components that are relied on to remain functional 
during and following design basis (postulated) events to assure: 

(1) The integrity of the reactor coolant pressure boundary, 

(2) The capability to shutdown the reactor and maintain it in a 
safe shutdown condition, and 

(3) The capability to prevent or mitigate the consequences of 
accidents which could result in potential offsite exposures comparable to the 
applicable guideline exposures set forth in 50.34(a)(1) or 100.11 of this 
chapter. 



* * * * * 





Total effective dose equivalent

 (TEDE) means the sum of the deep-dose equivalent (for external exposures) and the committed effective dose 
equivalent (for internal exposures).
