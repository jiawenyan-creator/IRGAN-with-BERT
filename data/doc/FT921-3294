FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Cakebread shares dive on warning
SHARES IN Cakebread Robey &amp; Co hit a new low of 25p yesterday, having
started the day at 45p, after the builders' and timber merchant warned that
losses for 1991 could exceed Pounds 1.3m and announced a board reshuffle.
The company said that the trading position was substantially worse than was
envisaged at the time of the announcement of the half year figures in
September.
Large losses on the manufacturing side were blamed, coupled with a
disappointing year for the merchanting activities which had been hit by
lower sales and reduced margins.
Mr Christopher Bostock has resigned as chairman to be replaced by Mr Martin
Earle. Mr Charles Smith has resigned as a director and Mr Kenneth Davies is
to retire after the annual meeting.
