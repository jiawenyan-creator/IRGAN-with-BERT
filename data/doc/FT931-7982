FT  22 FEB 93 / Kinnock warns over Labour union plan
MR NEIL KINNOCK, the former Labour leader, warned his successor Mr John
Smith yesterday that proposals being floated for creating 'associate
membership' of the party for trade union members were unworkable.
An interim report, setting out options for Labour's union links, will be
considered by the party's national executive on Wednesday. 'Associate
membership' is a possible compromise between ending union involvement and a
'one member, one vote' system.
Mr Kinnock said on BBC television: 'I don't think that you can have a kind
of diluted system in which people can exercise the full rights of being
members of the Labour party without accepting, at the appropriate rate of
subscription, the responsibilities of being members of the Labour party.'
Mr Kinnock, a supporter of 'one member, one vote' for selecting
parliamentary candidates, regretted that a decision on Labour's union links
had not been taken at last October's party conference.
