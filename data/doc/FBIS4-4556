  [Text] "While U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
stated that the United States was disappointed with Japan's 
market-opening package, he said the door remains open," said 
Hideaki Kumano, administrative vice minister of international 
trade and industry, at a news conference on 31 March. At the 
news conference, Vice Minister Kumano mentioned the fact that 
Mr. Kantor expressed dissatisfaction with the "package of 
external economic measures." However, he talked as if he had the 
impression that "there is hope that the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks will be resumed." 
  Vice Minister Kumano gave a self-evaluation of the economic 
package, saying: "(The United States) may not give standard 
marks to our package." Then, he added: "The United States 
needs to thoroughly review such measures as deregulation in the 
package." His remarks indicated that Japan wanted the United 
States to closely examine the details of its external economic 
measures. Moreover, he stated: "Now the government is briefing 
the United States on the current market-opening package through 
diplomatic channels. I hope it will serve as a stimulus." 
Thus, Vice Minister Kumano revealed that Japan is calling on 
the United States to resume the stalled Japan-U.S. talks.
