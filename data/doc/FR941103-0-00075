 

5. The Area Must Have a Fully Approved Maintenance Plan Pursuant to Section 175A of the CAA 


Section 175A of the CAA sets forth the elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment
to attainment. The plan must demonstrate continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS or at least ten years after
the Administrator approves a redesignation to attainment. Eight years after the redesignation, the state must submit
a revised maintenance plan which demonstrates attainment for the ten years following the initial ten-year period.
To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures,
with a schedule for implementation, adequate to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems. 
In this notice, EPA is approving the Commonwealth of Kentucky's maintenance plan for the Owensboro and Edmonson County
marginal nonattainment areas because EPA finds that the Commonwealth of Kentucky's submittal meets the requirements
of section 175A. 


A. Emissions Inventory_Base Year Inventory 


On November 13, 1992, the Commonwealth of Kentucky submitted comprehensive inventories of VOC, NO

X

, and CO emissions from the marginal nonattainment areas. The inventories included biogenic, area, stationary,
and mobile sources using 1990 as the base year for calculations to demonstrate maintenance. The 1990 inventory is
considered representative of attainment conditions because the O

3

 NAAQS was not violated during 1990. 
The Commonwealth of Kentucky submittal contains the detailed inventory data and summaries by county and source category.
This comprehensive base year emissions inventory was submitted in the SIP Air Pollutant Inventory Management System
(SAMS) format. Finally, this inventory was prepared in accordance with EPA guidance. A summary of the base year and
projected maintenance year inventories for the Owensboro and Edmonson County areas are included in this notice for
VOCs and NO

X

. The CO and the biogenic VOC values are shown below and are a part of the 1990 base year emission inventory. This notice
is approving the base year inventory. Refer to the TSD for more in-depth details regarding the base year inventory
for the marginal nonattainment areas.
