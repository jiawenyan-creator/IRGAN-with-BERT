  [Text] Geneva May 13 TASS -- Foreign ministers of Russia, 
Belgium, Great Britain, Germany, Greece and France, as well as 
the United States secretary of state coordinated their steps to 
achieve the soonest settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina, says a 
communique adopted on results of their today's meeting. 
  The ministers called on the conflicting sides to conclude a 
comprehensive agreement on termination of hostilities and pull 
efforts for the achievement of political settlement without any 
preliminary conditions. 
  They offered the Bosnian sides to begin negotiations under 
the aegis of the contact group within two weeks. The group 
includes representatives of Russia, the United States, the 
European Union and the United Nations. 
  In the opinion of the ministers, the agreement on 
termination 
of combat operations should entail separation of forces, 
withdrawal of heavy armaments and interposition of U.N. forces. 
The agreement should be concluded for four months with a 
possibility of its prolongation. The ministers think that the 
U.N. force in the conflict zone should be reinforced. 
  The fulfilment of the peace settlement agreement, including 
the troops pullback and separation, may result in a gradual lift 
of sanctions introduced by the United Nations.
