AIDS CASES, DEATHS 
AIDS has been a fact of life in Orange County since 1981, when the first 
resident case was diagnosed in November. Since then, 1,508 adults cases have 
been diagnosed (through June 30) and 938 of those people have died -- a death 
rate of 62%. 
A profile of the means by which county AIDS patients acquired the disease 
continues to show the overwhelming majority to be male homosexuals or bisexuals 
or intravenous drug users. And a look at how patients contracted the disease 
mirrors almost exactly deaths from AIDS. Here's a breakdown for both from the 
first cases through the end of June.

Male homosexual: 68%
