FT  29 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Improvement in Dow after Fed
stands pat
Wall Street
US stocks improved yesterday as investors warmed to the Federal Reserve's
decision to hold steady on interest rates, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 15.14 higher at 3,878.18 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 2.79 at 464.84. The Nasdaq composite gained
4.64 at 760.01. NYSE volume was heavy, with 330.3m shares traded by the
close.
The solid upturn in share prices was essentially a follow-through on the
relieved response to the Fed's inaction in the previous session. Stocks, led
by issues most sensitive to shifts in the economy, climbed steadily through
the morning, in parallel with a good advance by US government bonds. During
the afternoon, equities receded from their highs but still were well up on
the day.
The positive sentiment suggested that there had been some concern that an
immediate move to lift interest rates could have set back the corporate
sector at an unfortunate juncture.
Even though the Fed now appeared poised to lift rates whenever it deemed
appropriate, equity investors took advantage of the lull to lift share
prices with just two more sessions remaining in the third quarter.
The economic news on offer yesterday was inconclusive. The Commerce
Department said orders of durable goods last month had jumped 6 per cent,
against forecasts of a 3.8 per cent rise. But most of the unexpected gain
was linked to the transport sector, the most volatile component in the mix.
That was enough to allow investors to brush aside the news and concentrate
on a firmer dollar and a positive trend in bonds.
Cyclical stocks were among the strongest. Caterpillar, a Dow industrial
component, jumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 54 5/8 . Allied Signal rose
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 35 1/4 .
Cincinnati Milacron, a machine tool maker, bounded Dollars 2 1/2 ahead to
Dollars 26, a 52-week high. An upgrading by Merrill Lynch was the catalyst.
Gap Stores bounced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 32 3/4 thanks to favourable
reratings by at least two Wall Street pundits. The stock had retreated
during the previous sessions when other analysts took the opposite view.
On the losing side, MascoTech dropped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 11 3/8 after
the industrial engineering concern reduced its earnings estimate for the
full year.
On the Amex, Atari surged Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 7 1/2 , a 22 per cent
gain, on news that Sega Enterprises would buy 4.7m Atari shares as part of a
broad strategic agreement between the two computer game makers.
On the Nasdaq, Roadway Services backpedalled Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 56 3/4
. After the close of trading on Tuesday, the trucking company announced a
sharp decline in third-quarter net income. Antec, which makes products for
communications networks, was marked down Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 26 1/4
after issuing a profits warning.
Canada
Gold shares backed off from a Toronto market rally, limiting a gain in the
TSE 300 index to 11.70 points at 4,372.48. Overall, declines led rises by
408 to 329. Volume amounted to 61m shares valued at CDollars 914.7m.
A dose of profit-taking and a stronger US dollar were enough to put the
brakes on the surging gold sector, analysts said. The golds index slippped
1.40 per cent as the New York bullion price fell USDollars 3.20 to USDollars
394.55 an ounce.
Mexico
Equities crawled back to end down 1.9 per cent after the assassination of a
top official of the ruling party rocked the market at midsession - at one
stage losing some 3 per cent.
Traders said movement on the Mexican stock exchange was dominated by the
assassination of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, with investors selling off
shares because of this latest political upheaval. Mr Ruiz Massieu was gunned
down outside a Mexico City hotel early yesterday and died in hospital as
surgeons tried to save his life. He was the secretary-general of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary party, or PRI, and a former governor of the
state of Guerrero.
News of the shooting spread like wildfire on the trading floor and the
initial reaction was to dump stocks, a trader said. But bargain hunting
investors moved back into the market before the close, bringing a partial
recovery. The IPC index shed a net 53.61 at 2,764.82; at the end of 1993 it
stood at 2,602.63. Volume was an extremely heavy 172.54m shares worth 2.72bn
new pesos.
Mexico has seen a year of upheavals, including a New Year rebellion in the
state of Chiapas and the March assassination of presidential candidate Luis
Donaldo Colosio.
