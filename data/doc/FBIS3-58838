<F P=106> [Report signed "Jl": "Only Slight Recovery in Foreign Trade"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt, 21 January -- Germany's foreign trade 
saw only a slight recovery in November 1993, compared with 
November 1992. During the first 11 months of 1993, exports and 
imports declined markedly over the comparable period of the 
previous year. The Federal Statistical Office reports that goods 
worth 54.7 billion German marks [DM] were exported in November, 
a 0.4 percent increase from October. Imports increased by 0.6 
percent to DM46.5 billion. At DM8.2 billion, the export surplus 
remained stable over October, but it was distinctly up over 
November 1992 (DM1.7 billion). From January through November, 
goods worth DM547.4 billion were exported, which is 11.1 percent 
less than in the same period last year. Imports declined by 14.9 
percent to DM496.1 billion. At DM51.3 billion, the export 
surplus is markedly higher than last year (DM33.2 billion). Due 
to deficits in the service sector, as well as transfers, the 
favorable foreign trade balance in the goods and services 
balance turned into a DM34.6-billion deficit.
