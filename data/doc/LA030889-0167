Agent Norby Walters spread $2,500 in cash on a desk in front of Ronnie Harmon 
to persuade him to sign a contract that violated National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. rules, the former Iowa running back told a federal jury. 
Harmon, now with the Buffalo Bills, was the first witness in the Chicago fraud 
trial of New York-based agents Walters and Lloyd Bloom. 
Walters spread out the money on the desk of his New York office in front of 
Harmon, then a junior at Iowa, Harmon testified. 
"We're talking about business. The product is Ronnie Harmon," Walters said in a 
conversation Harmon tape-recorded March 10, 1985. 
During the 15 months he dealt with Bloom and Walters, Harmon said, he received 
a new Mercedes, plane tickets and other items worth about $54,000. He said he 
fired the agents a few days after Bloom had negotiated a $1.3-million contract 
for Harmon with the Bills. 
Under cross-examination, Harmon said he paid Bloom and Walters a total of 
$5,000. But he fired them before they could collect a commission on his 
National Football League contract.
