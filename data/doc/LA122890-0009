SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO 
Two alleged gang members from the Los Angeles area were sentenced Thursday for 
their roles in the $342,000 armed robbery of the jewelry counter in the 
Robinson's department store in North County Fair on July 27. 
Eric Deshawnn London, 18, was sentenced to 12 years in state prison, and 
co-defendant Corey Anthony Williams, 25, was sentenced to 11 years in prison. 
The two were convicted of two counts of armed robbery, two counts of auto 
theft, one count of assault with a deadly weapon and one count of burglary. 
A hearing to determine how much restitution should be paid was set by Superior 
Court Judge David M. Gill for Jan. 11, the same day that two other defendants 
will be sentenced. 
According to Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeffrey Brodrick, the two are gang members and 
the holdup generally matches other Southern Californian robberies attributed to 
various Los Angeles neighborhood groups associated with the Crips. 
Brodrick said only about $8,000 worth of jewelry was recovered when the four 
were arrested. He said that, in similar crimes, the weapon and most of the 
jewelry is handed off to accomplices.
