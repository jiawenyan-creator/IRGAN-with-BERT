  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 5 Jun (AFP) -- A dynamite bomb 
of moderate force killed two people when it exploded. The two 
people were carrying the bomb this Sunday in downtown Arauca, 
capital of the eastern department bearing the same name, located 
near the border with Venezuela, 350 km east of Santa Fe de 
Bogota, the police have informed. 
  The victims, Elizabeth Medina and William Montilla, were 
riding a motorcycle in downtown Arauca when the bomb went off. 
  The Arauca police are investigating the incident and said 
the 
guerrillas are to blame for the bloody incident, considering the 
upcoming 19 June presidential elections, in which the successor 
of President Cesar Gaviria for the 1994-1998 period will be 
chosen.
