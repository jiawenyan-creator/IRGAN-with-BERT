<F P=106> [Interview with Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat </F>
'Abd-al-Majid, in Damascus, by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo; 
date not given; from the "Dialogue from Afar" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] A meeting of the Higher Committee 
for Coordination among Joint Arab Committees has started in 
Damascus. Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 
'Abd-al-Majid, who opened the meeting, is with us on the 
telephone. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid, welcome to our program. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Thank you. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid, what ideas have you 
raised 
at the Higher Committee meeting? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] The Higher Committee comprises all the 
organizations working under the umbrella of the Arab League. 
The committee met last in Alexandria upon the invitation of the 
Arab Maritime Transport Academy. This meeting in Damascus is 
hosted by the Arab Arid Land Bureau. Various 
organizations--economic, agricultural, social, cultural, and 
educational--are taking part. The aim of the meeting is to 
coordinate Arab policies in various fields. We review the 
organizations' activities and coordinate among them. There are, 
of course, some projects undertaken jointly by more than one 
organization, such as the Agricultural Development Organization 
and the organization dealing with water issues. We seek to 
coordinate that work and enhance its efficiency. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Has anything new come up since the 
Alexandria 
meeting that will be discussed at the current session? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] There have been important developments 
concerning GATT, signed recently in Morocco, and some joint 
projects, particularly those concerning agricultural development 
and water resources. These issues are also within the Arab 
League's scope because they affect the Arab people and economy. 
Our aim is to maximize the benefits accrued to the Arab economy 
as a whole. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Will the current meeting come up with a 
vision for Arab cooperation, particularly as we are seeking to 
enhance cooperation among Arab countries? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Correct. This is the goal we seek. In this 
regard I can confidently state that there are no political 
differences. There is cooperation on issues leading to 
comprehensive development. All the Arab countries are eager to 
see these organizations promote the interests of all Arab 
citizens, from the ocean to the Gulf. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Where is the Yemeni crisis headed? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] You know that the Arab League, upon a 
resolution adopted at the recent meeting of its council, has 
dispatched a delegation to Sanaa. The delegation is still 
there. Its members met senior officials and delivered my message 
to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. The message basically 
stresses the need for a cease-fire and for finding ways to 
contain this crisis. Undoubtedly, we all hope we can create 
favorable circumstances for a dialogue among the Yemeni brothers 
to stop the fighting and bloodshed. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Reports say that you have put forward 
proposals that have not yet been publicized. Have you received 
a Yemeni response? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] There are telephone contacts with Sanaa and 
the Arab League delegation there. God willing, when I return to 
Cairo the delegation will have returned from Sanaa. We will 
have a clearer picture then. The situation is difficult. I 
hope the fighting will end so that we can seek a solution to 
this serious problem. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Do you think the Yemeni parties will respond 
to your proposals or will they insist that it is an internal 
affair? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] There is certainly a difference of opinion 
and a crisis among brothers. What concerns the Arab League and 
any party acting as a mediator is to find ourselves in a 
situation that facilitates dialogue among the parties concerned 
instead of fighting. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] When Yemeni unity was announced, the Arab 
League praised it, viewing it as exemplary. In view of what is 
happening right now, can we view things as a real test of the 
League's management of Arab issues? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] We are doing our utmost. I must say that the 
issue is primarily up to the Yemeni brothers rather than the 
Arab League or any other mediation that seeks to end the 
fighting among brothers. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] If the Yemeni parties fail to respond to 
your 
proposals, will the League pursue a different approach? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] We will take things as they come. Let us 
first see what this stage will produce. We hope to contain the 
situation and avert further deterioration at least. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Thank you very much. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Thank you my brother.
