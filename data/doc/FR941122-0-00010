SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The reorganization of the Immigration and Naturalization Service was approved by Attorney General Reno on January
14, 1994. A copy of the organization chart, which graphically illustrates the approved structure, is published with
this final regulation as Appendix A.


The reorganization will: (a) Create a clearer sense of mission by knitting together the Service's major functions
and programs; (b) decentralize decision-making authority and delegate authority to persons geographically closer
to the locations where work is being performed; (c) empower field operational units to improve the delivery of services
to customers; (d) re-engineer major processes, such as those which develop and disseminate organizational policy
and guidelines, and which are outdated approaches to handing records and information; and (e) develop a capability
and commitment to plan for the future, set customer service standards, and establish quantitative performance measures
to enable the Service to evaluate its programs and service delivery. To accomplish these goals, the reorganization
creates several new components through the restructuring of some existing ones and the abolition of others. Some
components retain their identity, but with revised duties and reporting relationships, while other components
remain unchanged. This final regulation formalizes the new components, responsibilities, and reporting relationships.
