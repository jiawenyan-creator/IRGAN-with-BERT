FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Pennzoil in Dollars 957m tax
wrangle
Pennzoil, the US oil company, has been presented with a tax demand for
Dollars 957m from the Internal Revenue Service over a settlement it received
six years ago after a long-running dispute with Texaco.
The IRS has ruled that Pennzoil should pay tax on the Dollars 2.2bn of the
Dollars 3bn settlement which it invested in shares in another oil company,
Chevron. Pennzoil, which has paid tax on the remaining Dollars 800m, has
always argued that the larger part of the settlement should not be taxed.
Pennzoil said it had received a ruling from the IRS that its 1988 income
should be increased by Dollars 2.2bn. This created a tax deficiency for the
year of Dollars 551m, plus additional after-tax interest of Dollars 234m.
Pennzoil added that the IRS had disallowed Dollars 366m of litigation and
other costs related to the dispute with Texaco, and that this would produce
a tax deficiency of Dollars 125m, plus interest of Dollars 47m.
The company said it continued to dispute the issue, and would appeal. It
added that it had the financial resources necessary to deal with any ruling
that followed. Late last year, Pennzoil sold Dollars 721m of Chevron stock,
prompting speculation that it was building cash reserves in case the IRS
ruling went against it.
The Dollars 3bn settlement followed a dispute over the manner in which
Texaco acquired Getty Oil in the early 1980s, after Pennzoil had already
reached agreement to buy the company.
