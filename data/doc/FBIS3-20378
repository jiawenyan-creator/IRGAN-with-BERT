  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis told Robert Lamb, the 
U.S. State Department special coordinator on Cyprus, that he is 
seriously concerned about the prospects for a Cyprus solution 
because of the Turkish Cypriot side's continuing intransigence. 
  Following the Kliridhis-Lamb meeting in the Presidential 
Palace this morning, government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis 
said that the U.S. coordinator submitted no proposals or ideas 
regarding the proximity talks on the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's]. Kasoulidhis added that Lamb asked to hear the 
Greek Cypriot side's evaluation regarding the impasse resulting 
from the talks. 
  Lamb described his meeting with President Kliridhis as very 
constructive. He said enough progress was made but refrained 
from identifying the topics on which there are differences. The 
U.S. coordinator will meet [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas 
in the occupied areas at noon. At 1700, Lamb will have another 
meeting with President Kliridhis.
