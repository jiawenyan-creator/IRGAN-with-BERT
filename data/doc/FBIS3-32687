  [Text] Vice President Alberto Dahik, Government Minister 
Marcelo Santos, and Industry Minister Jose Vicente Maldonado 
ruled out the possibility of a coup d'etat in Ecuador and denied 
there is no security for foreign investments in the country. 
The British magazine THE ECONOMIST a few days ago published a 
report that was reprinted by a Quito newspaper about the 
possibility of a coup d'etat in the next two years. The report 
stated that the Ecuadoran president plays merely a symbolic role. 
  Vice President Dahik said that democracy has the support of 
the Armed Forces. He added that these types of reports 
originate in the country to discredit Ecuador's leaders abroad. 
Marcelo Santos said that, God willing, President Sixto 
Duran-Ballen will complete his term. As government minister, he 
said, I can assure the country that there is no evidence to make 
us suspect that the country will experience such a situation in 
the near or distant future. 
  Industry Minister Maldonado said that the British magazine's 
analysis is not objective because it does not take into account 
the government's great willingness to strengthen the democratic 
system or the people's struggle to maintain democracy. THE 
ECONOMIST said that Ecuador is one of the countries with the 
greatest risk to investments because it has had weak governments 
that have not fulfilled their programs.
