FT  18 DEC 93 / Major rejects appeal on BCCI
Mr John Major has turned down a direct appeal from a Labour MP to intervene
in bringing about a settlement for creditors of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, saying it is for the collapsed bank's liquidators to decide
how best to proceed.
In a letter to Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, dated November 23
and released by Mr Vaz yesterday, the prime minister recognises that an
October decision by a Luxembourg court is likely to lead to 'a considerable
delay'.
