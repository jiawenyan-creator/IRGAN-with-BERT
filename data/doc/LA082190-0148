CERULLO SEEKS FUNDS TO BUY PTL 
Evangelist Morris Cerullo has asked his supporters to help him raise $52 
million to buy Jim Bakker's old PTL empire and "take back what Satan tried to 
steal," a newspaper reported today. 
Cerullo's organization is mailing to 1.5 million households nationwide a 
16-page color magazine that proclaims, "It's time to take back what Satan tried 
to steal." 
Cerullo, based in San Diego, is asking supporters of his ministry to donate $52 
million in cash before Oct. 23, the closing date set for the sale by federal 
bankruptcy authorities.
