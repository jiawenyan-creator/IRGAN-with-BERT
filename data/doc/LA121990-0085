2 HELD IN CONNECTION WITH FIRE AT FORMER CAR DEALERSHIP 
Two men are being held on suspicion of setting fire to an abandoned auto 
dealership to cover up evidence of a burglary, authorities said Tuesday. 
Steven M. Comstock, 18, and Doyle E. Fewell, 35, both believed to be 
transients, were arrested Saturday in connection with the fire at the former 
showroom of McLean Cadillac dealership in the 200 block of North Main Street, 
fire officials said. 
Santa Ana Fire Department spokesman Karl Ellman said the suspects started the 
fire late Friday night to "cover up evidence of another crime." He declined to 
elaborate. 
Sheriff's officials said Comstock and Fewell were being held on suspicion of 
burglary and arson at Orange County Jail. Their bails were $10,000 and $11,404 
respectively. Fewell was also being held on several municipal code warrants. 
The fire caused an estimated $600,000 damage and took about 40 firefighters 
more than two hours to contain. 
The showroom building, which contained offices and once held half a dozen or 
more Cadillacs at a time, is owned by the city of Santa Ana and is part of a 
redevelopment district. MATT LAIT
