FT  08 SEP 93 / Greek PM left with majority of one
THE Greek government appeared close to collapse yesterday after the ruling
conservatives' majority in parliament was cut to just one vote.
A right-wing backbencher, Mr Stefanos Stefanopoulos, declared he was leaving
the New Democracy party to sit as an independent. Mr Stefanopoulos is one of
a handful of conservative deputies backing Mr Antonis Samaras, a former
foreign minister who founded a breakaway political party two months ago and
is now trying to topple the government.
On Monday, Mr Samaras, the leader of Political Spring party, called on
dissident conservative deputies to rally behind him, saying it was time to
'rebel against outdated attitudes'.
Mr Samaras, sacked as foreign minister last year for taking a hardline
position on Balkan policy, is thought to have at least five supporters in
parliament. But only two defections would be needed for him to succeed in
overturning the government's fragile majority in the 300-member chamber.
The prime minister, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, accused Mr Samaras, a former
political protege, of betrayal. He has already warned the dissidents that he
will seek an early election if the conservatives lose their parliamentary
majority.
Mr Mitsotakis held emergency meetings yesterday with cabinet ministers and
senior party officials. However, it was not clear whether any more of Mr
Samaras's supporters would leave New Democracy. The rebellion started a year
ago over the government's plans for structural reform.
