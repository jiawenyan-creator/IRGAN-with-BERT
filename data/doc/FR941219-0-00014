 

The amendment clarifies that the regulation is intended to conform to the provisions of the APA by limiting the prohibition
on 

ex parte

 communications to communications to or from ``interested persons outside the agency,'' 5 U.S.C. 557(d), and by incorporating
explicitly the APA's separation of functions provisions, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). This approach is also consistent with
the most recent Model Adjudication Rules prepared by the Administrative Conference of the United States. 

The Board of Governors received two comments on the proposed rule, both of which supported it. One of the commenters
suggested that the Board explain the so-called ``Chinese wall'' that prevents those staff members involved in the
prosecutorial function from communicating with those who advise the Board on a particular matter. The amended rule
specifically sets out the APA's separation of function provision, which prohibits agency prosecutorial personnel
in one case from participating in the Board's decision on that or a factually related case. This provision clearly
prevents prosecutorial staff from communicating about the merits of a case with those staff members who advise the
Board regarding a final decision in the case. It is unnecessary to set out internal procedures implementing this statutory
prohibition in a formal rulemaking, and to do so could limit the Board's flexibility with respect to internal organization.




II. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Board of Governors hereby certifies that the final
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory
flexibility analysis is not required. 

The final rule makes a minor amendment to a rule of practice already in place, and affects intra-agency procedure exclusively.
Thus, it should not result in additional burden for regulated institutions. The purpose of the revised regulation
is to conform the provisions of the regulation to those imposed by statute.

Ex parte communication

 means any material oral or written communication relevant to the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding that was neither
on the record nor on reasonable prior notice to all parties that takes place between: 

(i) An interested person outside the Board (including such person's counsel); and 

(ii) The administrative law judge handling that proceeding, a member of the Board, or a decisional employee. 

(2) 

Exception

. A request for status of the proceeding does not constitute an 

ex parte

 communication. 

(b) 

Prohibition of ex parte communications

. From the time the notice is issued by the Board until the date that the Board issues its final decision pursuant to 263.40(c):


(1) No interested person outside the Federal Reserve System shall make or knowingly cause to be made an 

ex parte

 communication to a member of the Board, the administrative law judge, or a decisional employee; and

Separation of functions

. Except to the extent required for the disposition of

 matters as authorized by law, the administrative law judge may not consult a person or party on any matter relevant
to the merits of the adjudication, unless on notice and opportunity for all parties to participate. An employee or
agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for the Board in a case may not, in that
or a factually related case, participate or advise in the decision, recommended decision, or agency review of the
recommended 
decision under 263.40, except as witness or counsel in public proceedings.
