FT  04 FEB 94 / Greece may link to Turkish electricity
Greece plans to buy electricity from Turkey to cover shortages during peak
demand, ending a long-standing policy of rejecting economic co-operation
with its political rival. The Energy Ministry said DEH, the state power
monopoly, had been asked to submit detailed proposals for linking the Greek
and Turkish grids in Thrace, in north-east Greece.
Greece has turned down a Turkish offer to supply electricity to the eastern
Aegean islands, claiming it would be unacceptable for its tourist industry
to depend on Turkey. Two years ago, talks with the Turkish electricity
authority on linking the grids were called off after details of the plan
appeared in Greek newspapers.
Athens now faces difficulties in boosting capacity at peak periods as its
northern neighbours can no longer supply electricity on demand. A drought in
Albania, where power is produced by hydroelectric plants, has cut
electricity exports. Bulgaria suffers from an energy shortage because of
reduced transfers from Ukraine, while UN sanctions against the former
Yugoslavia have hit output there.
