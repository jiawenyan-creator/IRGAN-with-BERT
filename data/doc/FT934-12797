FT  25 OCT 93 / Observer: Model job
Seeing the Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers'
Federation are expected to tie the knot over the next few months, who is
likely to emerge as the combined entity's mouthpiece on economics?
Now that Andrew Sentance, the CBI's economics director, has handed in his
notice in favour of a job at the London Business School, the choice could be
a straight tussle between the affable Sudhir Junankar, Sentance's deputy,
and Ian Thompson, the cerebral but somewhat retiring economic adviser at the
federation.
Should the revamped body decide to look elsewhere, it might consider Ford's
head of economics, Kate Barker, one of the brighter economists currently
working in British industry.
Alternatively, there are at least two possible candidates from the CBI old
boy network: Leslie Gunde of GKN and Graham Burgess of BAT are both alumni
of the economics department.
The job could also suit Richard Freeman, the well-connected and heavyweight
chief economist at ICI who must be considering pastures new after the
demerger.
Any footloose Treasury economists, though, would presumably be questioning
how far the views of Neil Johnson, the outgoing EEF director-general whose
less-than-glowing assessment of the department has been amply aired, are
reflected in his colleagues' thinking.
