<F P=106> [Interview with Iraqi Minister of Agriculture Bashir 'Alwan </F>
Hammadi by Desislava Lilova; place and date not given: "Return 
to Iraqi Market Today, Tomorrow It Will Be Too Late"] 
  [Excerpts] [Lilova] Are you disturbed by the fact that 
the last official contacts between Bulgarian and Iraqi 
delegations were four years ago? 
  [Hammadi] Please allow me first to greet the friendly 
Bulgarian people, with whom we worked together for many years 
for the prosperity of our countries. Unfortunately, after the 
Gulf War the Bulgarian companies left Iraq and abandoned the 
construction sites they began. Now that those events are behind 
us we would like your companies to return and complete the 
construction projects. As you know, Iraq is exceptionally rich 
in resources. Our ambitions regarding the future are great and 
therefore the opportunities for our friends are substantial. 
  [Lilova] Does it mean that the Bulgarian construction 
projects have not been taken on by someone else? 
  [Hammadi] Yes, most of them stand as you left them. Only a 
few of them are being completed by Iraqi companies. 
  [Lilova] Could you say honestly until when Iraq will wait 
for Bulgaria to return to its construction projects? 
  [Hammadi] Frankly, we would like the Bulgarian companies to 
return today, before the embargo is lifted, because afterward 
everything will be easier and there will be pressure on the part 
of many candidates. The politicians know that an embargo is a 
temporary measures, while friends know that help counts when it 
is rendered at difficult times. 
  [Lilova] Iraq was one of the greatest markets for such 
important goods as weapons, meat, and medicines, which 
contributed much to our budget. Will you discuss with the 
Bulgarian side the manner of returning to your market? 
  [Hammadi] We still need your goods, especially the civilian 
ones. We will pose this issue and I hope that together we will 
find a mechanism that will allow you to export to Iraq. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Lilova] For four years, Bulgaria did not raise the issue of 
the $2 billion that you owe us. Will you discuss this issue now? 
  [Hammadi] We never denied the fact that we owe you, and when 
an Iraqi says something, it means that he will act accordingly. 
Iraq will not deny its obligations and will pay them back with 
oil. Bulgaria can be calm, its rights will be protected. It 
only is because of the circumstances that our debts to you were 
not eliminated by 1994. Indeed, you must know that for us this 
is not a great amount. 
  [Lilova] Do you not think that it is strange that the debtor 
is more interested in the deal than the creditor? 
  [Hammadi] We see the Bulgarians as friends. Those who love 
must also understand, help, and respect.
