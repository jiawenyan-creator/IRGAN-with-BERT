  [Text] Cairo, 8 May (MENA)--Zuhdi al-Qidrah, Palestinian 
ambassador and Fatah representative in Cairo, has praised the 
role played by President Mubarak and the Egyptian leadership and 
their great efforts to make the peace process a success. In a 
statement to MENA, he said that the Arab Republic of Egypt, led 
by President Mubarak, is making available all its resources to 
help implement the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and enable the 
Palestinian people, led by the PLO, to regain their rights and 
build their independent state. 
  Responding to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's 
statement on the return of refugees, al-Qidrah said that the 
statement has nothing to do with reality, as the Oslo agreement 
expressly provides for the return of the refugees of 1967 and 
later refugees to their homeland. He pointed out that the task 
of the quadripartite committee according to an agreement among 
Egypt, Palestine, Jordan, and Israel is to coordinate the 
process of the refugees' return and not to discuss the principle 
of their return.
