FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Spirax-Sarco given a boost
Devaluation helped Spirax-Sarco Engineering, the steam equipment specialist
which makes three-quarters of its profits overseas, lift pre-tax profits by
15 per cent to Pounds 26.7m in the year to December 31, against Pounds
23.1m.
Currency translation added Pounds 2.1m to the profits figure. Sales rose
from Pounds 154.2m to Pounds 193m, which included Pounds 17.4m from
acquisitions. Like-for-like sales improved by 14 per cent but were only 3
per cent higher at constant exchange rates.
Operating profit rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 28.1m (Pounds 24.8m) with
Pounds 904,000 coming from acquisitions.
Mr Chris Tappin, executive chairman, said order levels so far this year
hadmaintained the trend of volume growth which had been established in the
last quarter of 1993.
In particular, the group was now benefiting from improving conditions in the
US, although a number of economies in Europe remained in decline.
The chairman said: 'Given the continuation of present trading conditions we
look forward to another successful year.'
Strict control of stocks helped increase cash flow from operations of Pounds
31m (Pounds 26.7m) and November's enhanced scrip dividend saved a further
Pounds 1.9m in cash.
Group gearing was slightly reduced at 19 per cent, in spite of expenditure
of a net Pounds 12.6m on acquisitions and disposals.
Earnings per share rose by 28 per cent to 21.6p, against 16.9p depressed by
an exceptional disposal charge representing 1.7p.
The underlying earnings increase was 16 per cent.
A final proposed dividend of 3.3p makes a total for the year of 9.9p (9.3p).
COMMENT
These were good results from a quality company, even if sterling's weakness
against the dollar did flatter the headline numbers. Analysts were also
pleased by the company's optimism about the recent recovery in orders,
although the continuing caution over continental Europe was also noted.
Forecast profits of Pounds 30m this year put the shares, up 4p to 405p, on a
prospective multiple of 17.6. That 10 per cent premium to the market does
not look unjustified, given that the group is a late-cycle play and has
built an international network which will benefit greatly from increased
demand.
