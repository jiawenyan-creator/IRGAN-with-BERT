FT  20 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Settlement eases Canadian wood
strike fears
IWA-Canada, representing 15,000 British Columbian coastal area woodworkers,
has reached a settlement with employers that should also set a pattern for
woodworkers in the interior and the pulp and paper mill workers.
The pact, to be ratified by IWA members over the next two weeks, provides
pay increases of 3 per cent, 3 per cent and 2 per cent over three years,
plus signing bonuses of CDollars 1,000 in the first year, CDollars 500 in
the second and up to CDollars 500 in the third. Union members get priority
in hiring for the province's forest renewal programme.
Originally the IWA sought 18 per cent over three years.
Forest Industrial Relations, negotiating for the companies, said the deal
would be costly but the industry was ready to share the benefit of strong
timber markets.
Talks with the interior woodworkers and two different unions representing
the pulp and paper mill workers resume this week and hopes are high that a
strike can be averted.
