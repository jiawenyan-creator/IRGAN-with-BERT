  [Text] Hong Kong, January 21 (XINHUA) -- A number of new 
measures will be implemented later this year at the check points 
in Shenzhen, a city in southern China which borders Hong Kong, 
to facilitate the land freight shipment between the two areas. 
  Speaking at a press conference held today in Shenzhen, Yu 
Xiaosong, a senior Chinese official with the State Council, said 
that the new measures were made to meet the increasing demand of 
the freight exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong. 
  Yu, a vice minister of the State Commission for Economy and 
Trade, said that the six new measures which are mainly designed 
to simplify procedures and save time for the freight vehicles 
passing through the three check points will be put into force on 
March 1, 1994. 
  Besides, the Chinese side has also decided to open the three 
freight check points for 24 hours a day later this year as a 
further effort to facilitate the freight exchanges between the 
two areas, said Yu, adding that this still entails discussions 
with the Hong Kong side. 
  Yu was in Shenzhen to attend a two-day on-the-spot business 
meeting organized by his commission to examine and solve the 
problems regarding the land freight shipment between the 
mainland and Hong Kong.
