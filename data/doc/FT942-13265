FT  26 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Among the elite in the history of
culinary altercations
Sir, If it is true, as Michael Thompson-Noel reports ('A chef out of his
kitchen', April 23/24), that the famous chef Marco Pierre White, in the
whole of his career, has expelled only two customers, I have a greater claim
to fame than I thought. For history's sake, therefore, the following should
be recorded.
Dining at Mr White's former restaurant, Harveys, a couple of years ago with
a friend I committed a heinous crime after the main course. With my pen I
corrected the schoolboy howlers in the French of the pudding menu.
The maitre d' soon appeared and told us that the 'chef-proprietor' wished to
speak to me outside. I replied that if he wished to talk to me perhaps he
could come to the table. A few moments later Mr White did just that.
The exchange went as follows:
'Do you have a problem ?'
'No.'
'Well, **** off.'
The 'chef-proprietor' then retired and waiters began to clear the table,
informing us that we must leave. And so we did, out into a dark Wandsworth
night.
Thus are history and reputations made.
