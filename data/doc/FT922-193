FT  30 JUN 92 / Call for government review to cover state benefits
THE Institute of Actuaries, the trade association whose members advise the
pensions industry, has called for the government to expand its review of
occupational pensions to cover state benefits as well.
Mr John Martin, president of the Institute of Actuaries, said yesterday that
the patchwork legislation underpinning state benefits was becoming
unworkable and hampered effective private-sector pension provision.
He said: 'Unless the tax and regulatory regime for pensions in the UK is
given a thorough overhaul, employers will become increasingly discouraged
from making proper provision for employee pensions.'
He criticised the recent trend of employers to provide so-called 'money
purchase' pensions, which guarantee a lump sum upon retirement that is often
too small because of inflation.
Mr Martin urged actuaries to encourage employers to guarantee annual pension
increases pegged to inflation, and said that schemes that allowed increases
at trustees' discretion 'give rise to insecurity and discontent'.
He added: 'I believe that the much sought-after financial comfort in one's
physically uncomfortable old age can come more readily from an index-linked
scheme related to earnings near retirement.'
The government has deferred introduction of a law passed two years ago that
would have required employers to guarantee annual pension rises equal to 5
per cent or the retail prices index, whichever is lower.
