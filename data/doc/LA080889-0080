RULING PARTY ELECTS LEADER IN NEW ZEALAND 
Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer was elected leader of the ruling Labor 
Party today, placing him in line to succeed New Zealand Prime Minister David 
Lange. 
Lange, who announced his resignation Monday, is expected to formally hand over 
the prime minister's office to Palmer later today when they meet Governor 
General Paul Reeves. 
Political analysts say Palmer, a 47-year-old lawyer, represents the center of 
the party, which has been hit in recent months by factional fighting. Housing 
and Health Minister Helen Clark will succeed him, making her the highest 
ranking woman in New Zealand politics. 
"I'm so pleased the heritage of the party is locked into the people who will 
honor it," Lange told reporters after announcing Palmer's election in a party 
caucus. Asked for the voting numbers, he said, "That's a matter which I don't 
know." 
Lange announced his resignation after his party's members in the House of 
Assembly voted to return to the Cabinet former Finance Minister Roger Douglas, 
his one-time ally but now archrival. He fired Douglas last December in a 
dispute over the pace and scope of economic reform in New Zealand. 
Lange, 47, who underwent a heart operation last year, also cited health as a 
reason for quitting. He said he intends to remain in the House of Assembly, or 
Parliament. 
In 1984, Lange stirred controversy when his government denied permission for 
U.S. warships to enter New Zealand ports because Washington refused to confirm 
or deny whether specific ships carried atomic weapons. 
On Monday, before Palmer's election, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher 
said in Washington, "We are hopeful . . . that Prime Minister Lange's successor 
will reassess New Zealand's anti-nuclear policy."
