FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: NEC halts production of VCRs
NEC, the Japanese electronics group, has withdrawn from the manufacture of
VCRs in a move that highlights the harsh trading environment faced by
Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers.
The decision by NEC Home Electronics, NEC's wholly-owned subsidiary, to
retreat from VCR production comes as the demand in Japan for audio-visual
products has been particularly sluggish.
NEC will continue to supply VCRs manufactured by Sanyo on an original
equipment basis.
However, it will not distribute to mass sales discount stores where price
erosion can occur. Instead, it will restrict distribution to its 6,000
affiliated retailers in Japan.
The drop in the domestic market for VCRs is a growing problem for Japanese
consumer electronics manufacturers which are faced with a penetration rate
in Japan and the US of more than 80 per cent. VCR shipments in Japan have
fallen from a peak of 7.15m to an estimated 4.3m last year and are expected
to decline to 7.2m in 1993.
