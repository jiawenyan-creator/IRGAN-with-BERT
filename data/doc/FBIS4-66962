  [Text] We talked about the testimony of a former drug 
dealer who had been questioned by the U.S. Senate, and who had 
implicated members of Haiti's military in the drug trafficking, 
including the chief of Police. Following is a defense from 
Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Michel Francois to those accusations. 
We read: 
  On 28 October 1993, I publicly challenged Father Aristide or 
any of his supporters, foreign or national, to bring just one 
proof of the existence of any link between myself and illicit 
drug traffic. The allegations of drug dealer Gabriel Taboada, in 
prison for five years now and a witness in the service of U.S. 
agencies, reveal only two things: a blatant lack of imagination 
from the silent partners to this accususation which is, 
according to Beaumarchais, the last resort of cowards. Second 
point: the unbearable thoughtlessness with which the Haitian 
case is being treated in the United States. So far as I am 
concerned, the challenge remains complete. 
  This was a note from Lt. Col. Michel Francois in reaction to 
accusations of drug trafficking.
