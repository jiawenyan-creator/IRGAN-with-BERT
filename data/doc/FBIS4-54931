  [Text] Warsaw, 5 May (PAP)--Deputy Prime Minister [and 
finance minister] Grzegorz Kolodko today assured business 
representatives from 17 countries taking part in the East-West 
Business Forum in Warsaw that Poland has had quite good economic 
results and the economy has good prospects for further 
development. 
  Kolodko stressed that reforms in Poland are running on four 
tracks, but the main aim is the liberalization of the Polish 
economy supported by privatization. "We must bring the Polish 
economy from stabilization to economic growth. The hard work of 
society, the wise economic policy of the governing circles, and 
promotion of the habit of saving to increase the means for 
investment are necessary to achieve this aim. There cannot be a 
good market economy without a wise and stable economic policy, 
which the coalition government is set to develop and to build a 
good environment for doing business," Kolodko said.
