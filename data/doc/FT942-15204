FT  16 APR 94 / Boost for Labour's reflationary activists
Labour activists pressing for a strongly reflationary economic policy were
given a substantial boost yesterday when Mr John Edmonds, general secretary
of the GMB general workers' union, accepted presidency of the Full
Employment Forum.
The forum, founded by Mr Bryan Gould, MP for Dagenham, has campaigned
strongly for a big increase in borrowing to reflate economic demand and a
more relaxed approach to inflation.
Mr Edmonds said he had agreed to replace Mr Gould, who is returning to his
native New Zealand, to help maintain pressure on Labour to put full
employment 'at the top of the policy agenda.'
Mr Edmonds was careful to minimise differences between himself and the
leadership, noting that he was 'encouraged' by recent statements on economic
policy by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor.
However, he endorsed Mr Gould's call for the next Labour government to
increase borrowing by 'about' Pounds 10bn above the level inherited from the
Conservatives, including the release of accumulated local authority capital
receipts.
Echoing the leadership, Mr Edmonds said it was not reasonable for the
government to demand detailed economic policies at this stage of the
electoral cycle.
However, he also backed leftwing pressure on the leadership to set targets
for investment and cuts in unemployment during the life of the next Labour
government. He emphasised that 'the policy of full employment must be
credible in every sense'.
