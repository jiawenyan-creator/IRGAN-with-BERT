SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN ONOFRE 
An 8-month-old girl was among six people taken to a hospital Monday morning 
after a four-car, chain-reaction accident south of the San Onofre Border Patrol 
checkpoint, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
No one was seriously injured, but all six were taken to hospitals for 
examinations, said Jerry Bohrer, spokesman for the CHP's Oceanside office. 
The accident occurred about 11:05 a.m. when Salvador Ortega, 26, of Chula 
Vista, failed to slow for traffic in the northbound lanes of Interstate 5 at 
the checkpoint and rear-ended the car ahead of him, Bohrer said. Ortega's car 
hit that of Roy Anderson, 79, of Encinitas, who then struck Elvira Matta, 31, 
of Santa Ana, who in turn hit Molly Hagan, 29, of Los Angeles. 
Matta's 8-month-old daughter, Brenda, was in a child safety seat and was not 
visibly injured, but was taken to a hospital as a precaution, Bohrer said. 
Juana Ibarra, Matta's 65-year-old mother, was also a passenger in the car and 
taken to a hospital, he said. 
Traffic was snarled for about half an hour as three lanes on I-5 north were 
closed because of the accident, Bohrer said.
