  [Text] Beijing, June 9 (YONHAP) -- North Korea's actions in 
the coming few days will determine China's stance at the UN 
Security Council on sanctions against Pyongyang, South Korean 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Wednesday. 
  Arriving in Beijing for strategic talks with Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen, Han told reporters he would ask Beijing to 
tell North Korea exactly where the nuclear crisis stood so that 
Pyongyang would not make a misjudgement. "I came to seek China's 
support from two perspectives," Han said at the airport. "One is 
to seek its cooperation in preparing a sanctions resolution at 
the UN Security Council, and the other is to have China tell 
North Korea the feelings of the international community so that 
North Korea, for its own good, will not be uncooperative or make 
a misjudgement." 
  Han is expected to meet Qian for nearly two hours Thursday 
morning as the Security Council prepares to adopt a punitive 
resolution against North Korea. The resolution is likely to 
come next week. 
  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam personally instructed 
Han 
to fly to Beijing from the United Nations for talks with Qian. 
  China has thus far honored its alliance with North Korea and 
advised more dialogue while opposing sanctions. Beijing's 
opposition remains a key obstacle to concerted efforts by the 
security council. 
  "It's a dead-end street right now," said Han when asked 
about 
the practicality of China's insistence on dialogue, "but it's 
still possible if North Korea changes its attitude even now. It 
all depends on North Korea."
