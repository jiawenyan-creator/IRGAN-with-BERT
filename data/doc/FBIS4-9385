  [Excerpts] Gorazde -- The evacuation of the badly wounded 
from the Gorazde hospital has resumed today. By 1430, 81 people 
had been evacuated by UN helicopters from the city. The 
evacuation is still under way. [passage omitted] 
  The skimpy information says that the chetniks have started 
to 
pull back their murderous units to the distance envisaged by the 
NATO ultimatum. However, they have still not withdrawn the tank 
in (Kazagici), which is less than 2 km from the city center. 
  The Blue Helmets have started to impose a buffer zone in the 
region. The Gorazde Presidency is holding intensive talks with 
the representatives of civilian structures of the UN Protection 
Forces in Gorazde on the normalization of the situation in the 
city. The priority is the water supply for Gorazde, since 
yesterday the chetniks blew up the reservoir of industrial 
water, which the people of Gorazde have been using as drinking 
water over the last two years. Electricity is also a big 
problem, as this city has not had any for two years. The lack 
of food after a month has been alleviated by the arrival of the 
UNHCR convoy. [passage omitted]
