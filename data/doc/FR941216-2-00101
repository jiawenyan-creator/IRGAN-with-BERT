<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to conduct public scoping and prepare an environmental impact statement. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The action proposed is to conduct scoping and to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the proposal of
DALEN Oil  Gas Co., Cabot Oil  Gas Co., and several other oil and gas companies (Companies) to drill up to approximately
1,322 infill wells in the existing Fontenelle and Lincoln Road natural gas fields over the next 10 years beginning
in 1995. The projects would occur within an area of existing oil and gas activity which is referred to as the ``cumulative
study area.'' The cumulative study area encompasses all or portions of 27 townships (T. 2228 N., R. 108113
W.) or approximately 900 square miles. The Green River forms the western edge of the cumulative study area. The area
is characterized by intermittent drainages, sagebrush-greasewood vegetation and an absence of residences. Lands
within the cumulative study area are primarily BLM and Bureau of Reclamation-administered but include minor amounts
of State and private land. Affected lands are primarily used for grazing, recreation, and oil and gas production.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 A Scoping Notice will be distributed by mail on or about the date of this notice. Responses and comments will be accepted
for 30 days following the date of this notice. No public meetings are scheduled at this time. The comments and concerns
received in response to the scoping will aid the BLM in identifying alternatives and assure all issues are analyzed
in the EIS. Should public demand warrant a public meeting, it will be scheduled at a later date.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The intent of the Fontenelle Natural Gas Infill Drilling Projects is to enhance natural gas recovery from the Fontenelle
and Lincoln Road lease areas, allowing the Companies to provide more natural gas to pipeline companies distributing
and supplying natural gas to consumers. This would benefit consumers by making additional supplies of clean-burning
natural gas available. The additional wells will maximize production in an area where approximately 447 wells are
already producing. The existing wells, plus the maximum potential development wells, could result in up to approximately
1,769 wells within the combined Fontenelle and Lincoln Road fields. However, the level and rate of additional drilling
and development will be contingent upon gas prices and energy tax credits. In addition to wellheads and production
units, associated facilities will include access roads, natural gas gathering pipeline systems, and individual
well tank facilities. 


An environmental assessment and supplement were prepared on natural gas development within the Fontenelle and Lincoln
Road areas in 1991 and 1992 respectively. The decisions for these environmental analyses concluded that a certain
level of development could be authorized without resulting in significant impact to the human environment. Development
concurrent with the preparation of the Fontenelle Natural Gas Infill Drilling Projects would be authorized so long
as it remains within the scope of the existing environmental analyses and decisions. Land and resource management
issues and concerns associated with the construction of roads, well pads, and pipelines; the drilling and completion
of wells; and the operation and maintenance of a producing well field that will be analyzed in the EIS include: 
&bull;Potential impacts to big game crucial winter range and habitat. 
&bull;Potential impacts to wildlife caused by poaching, harassment and increased vehicular access. 
&bull;Potential impacts to sage grouse breeding and nesting habitat.
