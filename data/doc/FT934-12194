FT  27 OCT 93 / Strike called over Belgian austerity plan: EC summit faces
disruption
BELGIUM'S Socialist trade unions yesterday called for a one-day public
transport strike on Friday to protest against the government's proposed
austerity package.
The day of the strike coincides with the summit of European Community
leaders in Brussels, which as a result will face disruption from traffic
chaos, stoppages and demonstrations.
Last week, the Socialist unions walked out of talks with government and
employers on how to solve the problems of lack of competitiveness,
unemployment and a growing social security deficit.
Yesterday, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister, unveiled outline measures
which the country's centre-left coalition will now try to push through on
its own. The task is particularly delicate because there are doubts whether
the French-speaking Socialist members of the coalition will support
proposals opposed by the unions.
The unions are angry about plans to limit wage costs. Mr Dehaene has
suggested freezing pay and delaying the impact of salary increases for 1994
which have already been agreed with employers.
Senior Belgian government officials said yesterday that the package of
measures would try to achieve the same aims as last week's failed talks, but
without inflaming the unions and risking the collapse of the coalition.
A statement issued after yesterday's cabinet discussion of the package tried
to reassure the unions by promising that the government would concentrate on
improving employment. But Mr Dehaene warned at a news conference that some
form of wage restraint would almost certainly have to be included in the
final measures.
Mr Dehaene, who will chair Friday's EC summit, will start talks on the
detail of the measures with his coalition partners on Saturday morning.
Officials admitted yesterday that the failure to agree a framework deal with
the unions and the employers would make the task much more difficult.
