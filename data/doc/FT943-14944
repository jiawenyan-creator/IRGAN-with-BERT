FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Motor boost helps DC Cook to Pounds 2m
A substantial upturn in its motor division enabled DC Cook Holdings to
report pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.21m for the year to April 30 compared
with losses of Pounds 132,000, restated for FRS 3.
There was also a Pounds 576,000 fall in interest payable to Pounds 908,000
as borrowings were cut over the period by Pounds 670,000 bringing gearing
down to 60 per cent.
However the results were held back by increased losses in the UK and Spanish
property divisions. The UK side, which includes the shopping centres, saw
losses increase from Pounds 498,000 to Pounds 585,000. In Spain, where no
sales were completed during the year, there was a loss of Pounds 629,000,
compared with profits of Pounds 130,000.
Mr Derek Cook, chairman of this USM-quoted company, said that motor turnover
was up 40 per cent with the numbers of new cars sold up by 21 per cent and
used cars rising by 32 per cent.
The division's operating profit advanced to Pounds 5.53m (Pounds 2.95m) with
margins rising from 2.9 to 3.9 per cent.
Group turnover was up 33 per cent at Pounds 143.4m (Pounds 108m). Earnings
per share came out at 3.6p (0.44p). A final dividend of 0.7p is recommended
making a total for the year of 1p (0.6p).
On prospects Mr Cook said the motor division was continuing its strong
performance with new car sales in May up 52 per cent compared with an
overall national rise of 10 per cent. He was also confident that there would
be an improvement in the non-motor activities having substantially reduced
UK property stocks and adapted to changed trading conditions in Spain.
