ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; 
JAMBOREE RAMP TO I-405 WILL CLOSE FOR ROADWORK 
Drivers heading south on Jamboree Boulevard today will find the entrance to the 
northbound San Diego Freeway closed for construction. 
The ramp will remain closed until late January as work continues on the San 
Diego Freeway widening project. 
However, the other Jamboree entrance to the northbound San Diego Freeway, which 
had been closed since late November to drivers heading north on Jamboree, will 
reopen today. 
Other openings and closures of Jamboree-San Diego Freeway interchange ramps 
include: 
* The reopening of the northbound San Diego Freeway off-ramp to Jamboree on 
Tuesday. It has been closed since late November. 
* The northbound Jamboree on-ramp to the southbound San Diego Freeway will 
remain closed until Dec. 26. 
* The southbound Jamboree on-ramp to the southbound San Diego Freeway, which is 
open, will close in early January for most of the month. 
The widening project will add car-pool lanes in both directions of the San 
Diego Freeway through the county and is scheduled to be completed by April, 
Caltrans spokesman Albert Miranda said. 
The work is part of the project's second phase, from the Corona del Mar Freeway 
to the Santa Ana Freeway, Miranda said. Caltrans finished the first phase of 
the project, from the Corona del Mar Freeway to the San Gabriel Freeway, in 
August. LEN HALL
