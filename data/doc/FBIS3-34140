  [Text] Tzomet's Central Committee, which convened in 
Ari'el today, approved by a majority of votes a proposal 
submitted by the movement's leader Refa'el Eytan calling for the 
expulsion of the three resigning Knesset members: Segev, 
Salmovitz, and Goldfarb. 
  Our correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that an uproar broke 
out when Eytan attacked the members of one of the Tzomet 
branches and the news correspondents at the convention. Eytan 
wanted to present documents proving that there had been 
irregularities at Tzomet's Bat Yam branch. The news 
correspondents rushed to interview the Bat Yam branch members, 
and Eytan remarked: Look at them pouncing on the corpses. 
Eytan told the Bat Yam branch members that this was what they 
would look like tomorrow.
