FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Boeing cautious despite advance
BOEING, the US aerospace group, reported a 27 per cent increase in
fourth-quarter earnings but said it expected 1992 revenues to grow only
slightly, to around Dollars 29.5bn from Dollars 29.3bn in 1991.
The world's largest civilian aircraft manufacturer said it expected
increased sales in 1992 of its 737 and 757 commercial jets to offset a
nominal decline in sales of defence and space equipment.
The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 403m, or Dollars
1.17 a share, compared with Dollars 318m, or 92 cents, in the same period of
last year. Revenues were Dollars 7.75bn, up from Dollars 7.01bn. For the
full year, Boeing made Dollars 1.57bn, or Dollars 4.56 a share, compared
with Dollars 1.38bn, or Dollars 4.01, on sales of Dollars 27.59bn in 1990.
Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman, said the increase in 1991 earnings was due
mainly to better commercial aircraft sales, a lower operating loss at the
defence and space business, and a lower tax rate. This was partially offset
by higher research and development expenses, principally for its new
two-engined, wide-bodied aircraft, the 777, and lower other income.
The defence and space business, which was profitable in the fourth quarter,
had an annual operating loss of Dollars 102m, down from Dollars 418m in
1990. He expected this sector to be profitable in 1992.
Mr Shrontz said the outlook for commercial airlines in 1992 remained
uncertain, although traffic and yields appeared to be improving at the
year-end.
The economic slowdown had particularly affected demand among all
manufacturers for aircraft with fewer than 150 seats, and production rates
for Boeing's 737 jet could be subject to further reduction. However, he
added that demand for wide-bodied aircraft remained strong.
Boeing's firm order book at the end of December was Dollars 97.9bn, compared
with Dollars 97.2bn at the end of 1990.
