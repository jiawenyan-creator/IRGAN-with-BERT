FT  11 JUN 93 / Observer: 'Ere we go
The City is full of strange bed-fellows. So perhaps it's unfair to highlight
the irony in the move by Thatcherite David Pascall, a former member of the
Number 10 policy unit, to work for Lord Hollick, founder of the leftish
leaning Institute for Public Policy Research.
Pascall - who has been made an offer he couldn't refuse from Hollick's MAI -
brushes political differences aside, calling his new boss 'first and
foremost a professional businessman'.
Perhaps even more intriguing is what Pascall, former chairman of the
National Curriculum Council, will make of the language on MAI's dealing
floor.
During his campaign to raise the standards of spoken English, it emerged
that he was deeply offended at the 'sloppy talk' of children's TV
presenters.
