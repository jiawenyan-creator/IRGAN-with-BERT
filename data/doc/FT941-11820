FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Contract changes fail to halt advance at
BAA
Achange to important retail contracts distorted the first set of nine month
figures from BAA, the former British Airports Authority. However, pre-tax
profits inthe period to the end of December were little affected by the
change, rising 13per cent to Pounds 292m.
At the six month stage profits were up from Pounds 218m to Pounds 237m.
Sir John Egan, chief executive, said the nine month figures 'confirm our
confidence in the prospects for the remainder of the current financial year
and for the long term'. BAA shares fell 26p to Pounds 10.55p.
Two of the company's leading retailers, Allders and Forte, switched to new
contracts last year, under which they are paid a management fee with BAA
taking their total turnover into its revenue figure. This boosted the
revenue figure, but also raised operating costs.
Revenue rose 16 per cent to Pounds 873m, including retail revenue up 51 per
cent to Pounds 366m. Stripping out the effect of the contract changes, the
underlying growth in retail revenue was 8 per cent. Retail income, as at the
six month stage, formed the largest source of revenue.
Passenger numbers rose 5 per cent to 64.5m, but because of the RPI minus 8
per cent pricing formula set by the regulator, total landing charges fell
slightly.
Operating costs rose from Pounds 443m to Pounds 545m, but on a comparable
basis, said Mr Nigel Ellis, finance director, costs were barely changed.
The cost figure includeda property write-down of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 17.8m).
Mr Ellis said that with the propertyrecession now ending he hoped in future
to see property write-backs.
Theinterest charge fell from Pounds 49m to Pounds 36m, with net debt at
Pounds 621m, down from Pounds 748m a year earlier.
Tax of Pounds 77m was provided, based on the estimated rate for the year,
leaving earnings per share up 10 per cent at 42.2p.
