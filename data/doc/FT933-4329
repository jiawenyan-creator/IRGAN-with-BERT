FT  09 SEP 93 / Observer: Secret scoop
Adam Mynott, a BBC radio reporter, fell on his feet in a big way yesterday
when he telephoned the Downing Street press office and found himself
listening to a conversation between John Major and Kenneth Clarke.
Major said later that the few seconds of conversation overheard by Mynott
involved no security breaches, although Downing Street has started an
inquiry. Mynott was saying nothing about what he heard, but watch out for
budget scoops.
