  [Text] Brussels [no dateline as received] -- Vitaliy 
Radetskyy, Ukraine's defense minister and general of the Army, 
continued on 26 May his official visit to the NATO headquarters. 
  On 25 May, at the Ukrainian president's instruction, 
Radetskyy handed Sergio Balanzino, deputy chairman of the North 
Atlantic Council, a presentation document outlining guidelines 
for Ukraine's cooperation with NATO states within the 
Partnership for Peace [PFP] program. The submission of this 
document means that Ukraine has become one of the first NATO 
partner states whose relations with the North Atlantic bloc are 
being transferred into a practical framework. The first step of 
Ukraine's cooperation with NATO will be the participation of 
Ukrainian servicemen, together with American, Hungarian, and 
Polish soldiers in a special military exercise scheduled to take 
place this summer in Poland.
