  [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze declared that 
the republic has a great potential in order to raise its 
economy. During the meeting with the mission of the 
International Monetary Fund, on a visit in Tbilisi, he also said 
that at present hunger and economy's freezing are the most 
serious dangers threatening the republic. In Shevardnadze's 
words, Georgia will fulfill all recommendations of the 
International Monetary Fund which is expected to grant $60 Mn to 
Tbilisi. 
  For his part, Mohamed Shadman Valavi, head of the IMF 
mission, expressed his opinion saying that the IMF apparently 
should take care of Georgia in order to provide for its support 
on the part of industrial states. 
  Our Interfax correspondents report that during the meeting 
the parties spoke not only about long-term programs of 
cooperation but about the ways to solve Georgia's most pressing 
problems.
