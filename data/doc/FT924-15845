FT  02 OCT 92 / ERM: The Anglo-German Row: Bank of France spent FFr80bn
supporting franc through crisis
CONFIRMATION that the French central bank spent around FFr80bn (Pounds
9.4bn) in defending the franc during the currency crisis emerged yesterday
in the Bank of France's weekly report.
The report reveals that the bank's net external position fell by nearly
FFr83.4bn in the seven days to September 24, last Thursday. Around 95 per
cent of this will have been spent in intervening to support the currency,
said economic analysts.
The figure also includes other transactions on the official account, not all
of which are split out in the weekly report, so it is not possible to come
to an exact figure for intervention. However, it does indicate that the Bank
of France has very little left from its currency reserves, which stood at
FFr97.7bn at the end of August. The Bank of France had no comment yesterday.
The report also reveals that the bank's holdings of short-term paper rose by
FFr70.5bn over the period, representing the amount it has lent to French
commercial banks, seeking a cheaper source of funds than the overnight money
markets.
Rates for call money have climbed steeply since the French central bank
started to intervene, to more than 25 per cent earlier this week. However,
they began to ease yesterday towards 15 per cent as the central bank
injected more liquidity into the markets.
The figure emerges a day after the French government tabled a cautious
budget in an attempt to hold off a new attack against the franc.
It suggests that the central bank might find it harder to intervene to
support the currency if the markets launched another attack on the scale of
last week's currency crisis. Since last week's intervention the franc has
held above its floor against the D-Mark.
