FT  22 SEP 92 / Mexico cements ties with Vatican
MEXICO and the Vatican have established full diplomatic relations, putting
an official end to more than 130 years of church-state hostility.
Mexico's Foreign Ministry said in a tersely worded communique that the
decision was based on constitutional reforms last year that gave legal
recognition to religious institutions for the first time in more than 70
years.
The reforms overturned Mexico's anti-clerical 1917 constitution and allowed
churches to own property and run schools. They also gave priests the right
to vote and wear clerical attire in public.
While nearly 90 per cent of Mexicans are Catholic, the church and state have
been in conflict since 1861, when President Benito Juarez expelled the Papal
Nuncio. In the last century the Catholic church owned half Mexico's land and
opposed independence from Spain, making it the favourite target of reformers
such as President Juarez.
The church also opposed Mexico's 1910 revolution, from which sprang the
political party that, under a different name, still runs Mexico. The
church-state conflict led to open warfare in the late 1920s as conservative
peasants, known as Cristeros, took up arms against the government.
President Carlos Salinas, however, has been determined to leave behind the
old, anti-clerical and nationalist Mexico and has sought reconciliation with
the church.
His legal changes in part clarify what was already common practice with
laws, such as those against private religious education, ignored.
