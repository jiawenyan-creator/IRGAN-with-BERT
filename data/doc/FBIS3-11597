  [Text] In a message to the nation dated 21 March, Haitian 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has formally ordered Commerce 
and Industry Minister Louis Dejoie II to put an end to the 
illegal activities occurring within the scope of an alleged 
agreement signed on behalf of the Haitian state and granting an 
area of over five hectares to the company (Portortuga S.A.) 
without the approval of the Council of Ministers. Invested with 
the powers bestowed on me by the Constitution, I am the manager 
of the independence and of the integrity of the national 
territory, recalls President Aristide citing Article 138 of the 
fundamental charter. On that score, he says, the commerce and 
industry minister is going against all the laws governing the 
matter.
