TUSTIN'S HELICOPTERS OVER IRVINE 
Your pro and con letters (April 22) on the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Air 
Station all missed the primary objection to this Marine country club. 
None pointed out that very few of the Marines assigned to that station actually 
work there. 
It is, unfortunately, true that helicopter crews must pass over the heads of 
the Irvine, Tustin, Orange and Anaheim residents on their way to and from work. 
You see, there is no area in Orange County where they can perform practice 
combat flying, and they are a combat station, the same as El Toro. 
So, in order to get to one of the three major combat training areas where they 
work, a skeleton crew flies a two or three jet helicopter burning more fuel 
than a Boeing 727 or 737. Next time you fly to San Francisco or Sacramento, 
remember that your jet is burning the same amount of jet fuel going to your 
destination as the three Marines in the jet helicopter flying to work at Yuma, 
Imperial Valley or Twentynine Palms burn in theirs.
