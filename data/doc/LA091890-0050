WALESA ANNOUNCES HE WILL RUN FOR POLISH PRESIDENCY 
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Monday that he will run for president of 
Poland, a job now held by the general who once imprisoned him and sought to 
crush his labor union. 
Walesa said he hoped to speed the nation's transition from communism to 
democracy. 
Post-Communist Poland's first fully democratic presidential and parliament 
elections are expected as early as this fall and no later than spring. 
"Today I made up my mind. I am putting forward for society's approval my 
readiness to be a candidate for the post of president of the Polish Republic in 
popular elections," Walesa said. 
"For me, it is a fulfillment of the pledge I made in August, 1980," he said, 
when he catapulted to worldwide fame by leading strikes that helped create the 
East Bloc's first independent trade union. 
When Solidarity was created 10 years ago, Walesa pledged that he would fight 
for the overthrow of communism and the establishment of full democracy in 
Poland. 
Walesa has hinted at his presidential intentions for nearly a year, saying he 
needs to take the post to spur political and economic reforms. In June, he 
said: "I do not want to be president. I will have to be president."
