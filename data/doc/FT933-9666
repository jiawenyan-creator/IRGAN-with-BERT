FT  09 AUG 93 / Oil cut-off undermines Ukraine
MR LEONID Kuchma, Ukrainian prime minister, at the weekend gave his most
serious warning so far on the economy, saying it faced a 'catastrophe',
Russia having stopped supplying oil because of arrears on the hard currency
payments now required.
Mr Kuchma was trying to tackle the immediate oil problem by telephone calls
to Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister.
But the Ukrainian premier said that, in the long run, the only prescription
for Ukraine's economic ills was 'a very radical reform programme' which the
government would unveil early next month.
According to Mr Daniel Kaufmann, head of the World Bank mission in Ukraine,
the country's crisis is created by 'the combination of two factors - Ukraine
is the first country in eastern Europe or the former Soviet Union to cross
the threshold into hyper-inflation, and it is in the midst of an
overwhelming balance of payments crisis.'
