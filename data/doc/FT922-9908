FT  05 MAY 92 / Short-term hiring picks up
BRITISH companies are showing a fresh interest in hiring workers on
temporary contracts, as demand starts to pick up and union resistance
appears to be on the wane.
Temporary contracts, allowing employers to respond more flexibly to
fluctuations in demand, have been more common in Japan and continental
Europe. But last month Dutch-owned truck maker Leyland DAF became the first
big vehicle manufacturer to introduce temporary workers in its UK plants.
The company took on 100 staff on three-month contracts after signs that
demand was picking up. If the recovery is not sustained the company has the
option of cutting back again.
'A strategy of using temporary workers is now going to be a permanent
feature in our company; that's the way our parent company DAF has operated
for a long time,' Mr David Rowlands, communications manager, told the
magazine Personnel Today.
The unions agreed to the recruitment on temporary contracts in a deal which
also included a wage freeze.
In the public sector, a combination of uncertainty over annual income and
devolution of bargaining is expected to make temporary contracts attractive
to trust hospitals opting-out from local health authority control in the
National Health Service.
The National Communications Union has agreed with the Royal Mail's
engineering and construction business that contracts of less than six months
can be negotiated.
The property market is on course to improve next year, according to Healey &amp;
Baker, the commercial property specialist.
Its Quarterly Investment Report says political stability together with
optimism about a likely fall in interest rates have opened the way for an
upturn in the property sector.
