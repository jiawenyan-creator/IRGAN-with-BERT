FT  06 JUL 93 / 'Wise men' forecast growth
THE UK has the potential for a period of relatively high growth without
undue inflation, the Treasury's panel of outside forecasters said yesterday.
Four of the seven advisers also called for tough action to bring down the
large gap between government spending and receipts, beyond the rises in
taxation announced for next April.
Together with economic figures issued yesterday, the first report from the
'seven wise men' to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, supported notions
that a sustainable upturn may be on its way although it warned that in the
short term the recovery could be 'slow and patchy'.
