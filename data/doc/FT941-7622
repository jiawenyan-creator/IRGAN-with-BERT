FT  24 FEB 94 / British Gas 'genuinely embracing' competition
Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, says it believes British Gas 'has
genuinely embraced competition', only two months after the government
decreed that the company's monopoly in supplying 18m mainly residential
customers should be ended in 1998.
Ms Claire Spottiswoode, Ofgas director general, said in presenting its
annual report yesterday that 'on many fronts we both have the same strategic
aims.'
The regulator's enthusiastic assessment of British Gas's attitude to
competition was in marked contrast to earlier reports, in which the company
came in for severe criticism.
Ms Spottiswoode conceded, however, that British Gas's new attitude to future
competition was based in large part on its desire to reduce the influence of
the regulator on its businesses.
