I. Background 


On December 9, 1991, DOE published proposed regulations adding Part 830 to Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations
in order to establish a body of rules for the safe management of DOE nuclear facilities (``December Notice,'' 56 FR
64316). The December Notice addressed nine specific areas related to nuclear safety: (1) Safety Analysis Reports,
(2) Unreviewed Safety Questions, (3) Quality Assurance Requirements, (4) Defect Identification, (5) Conduct of
Operations, (6) Technical Safety Requirements, (7) Training, (8) Maintenance, and (9) Operational Occurrences.

DOE received written comments from 29 groups on the December Notice and held a public hearing in Germantown, Maryland,
on February 25, 1992, at which five persons provided oral comments. After reviewing the written and oral comments,
DOE has decided to issue a final rule on the sections relating to the general provisions and the quality assurance requirements.
DOE will issue final rules on the remaining proposed sections of Part 830 as it completes its analysis of the individual
sections and the comments thereon.
