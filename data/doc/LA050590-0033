GEE, AND HE STILL LOOKS SO LIFELIKE 
Amazing. Two coaches not thought good enough to coach the Clippers have brought 
NBA teams into the playoffs -- Jim Lynam of Philadelphia and Don Chaney of 
Houston. I would think one of the teams that didn't make the playoffs this year 
should contact Don Casey.
