FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Apple rises to Dollars 132m on
strong sales
APPLE Computer, the personal computer manufacturer, yesterday reported
third-quarter net income of Dollars 132m and claimed strong sales momentum,
despite the fierce competition wracking the PC sector.
The income figure, which worked through at Dollars 1.07 a share, compared
with a net loss of Dollars 53m or 44 cents a share, in the third quarter of
last year when the group took a Dollars 224m pre-tax charge for
restructuring.
Sales in the latest quarter rose 13.8 per cent to Dollars 1.74bn, against
Dollars 1.52bn a year ago.
The gross margin was 44.3 per cent of sales, down from the 45.8 per cent of
a year ago, but an improvement over the second quarter of this year, thanks
to a better product mix.
Mr John Sculley, the chairman, said the company's new PowerBook laptop had
sold over 300,000 units in the last three quarters and Apple expected to
reach its Dollars 1bn sale target in the computer's first year of
introduction.
For the nine months the company reported net income of Dollars 432m, or
Dollars 3.52 a share, against Dollars 228.6m, or Dollars 1.91 a share, in
the same period of 1991, with revenues rising from Dollars 4.8bn to Dollars
5.32bn.
