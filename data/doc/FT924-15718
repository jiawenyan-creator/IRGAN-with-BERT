FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (6): Overcoming
time-zone problems - Pepsi-Cola International / Messaging network
PEPSI-COLA INTERNATIONAL is going to base the hub of its new messaging
network in Britain, although its headquarters are in the US. Why? Because
the UK business day overlaps with part of the business day in each of the
main countries in which the company operates.
This enables Pepsi-Cola International (a subsidiary of US food and drink
company, PepsiCo) to provide users with a single source of support. It is
particularly important when the company is trying to consolidate monthly
figures from around the world, some coming from areas where
telecommunication links are poor.
The centre can advise on alternative ways of sending figures into the
messaging system (eg via telex machine).
Another factor in Pepsi's choice of location was that some telecommunication
charges in Britain were among the lowest of the countries it looked at.
The system, which goes live in October, will be managed and supported by US
computer company Digital Equipment Corporation from its UK centre at
Newbury, Berkshire.
The main hub of the network, a Vax computer in Newbury, will provide
electronic mail (e-mail) and file transfer (including spreadsheets) between
personal computers located at 60 of Pepsi's offices worldwide. The network
is based on the internationally-agreed X400 electronic mail (or 'e-mail)
standard.
Digital will run the messaging system under a five-year, fixed-price,
single-supplier agreement worth Pounds 2.5m. It will bill Pepsi companies in
dollars via electronic mail, but they will pay in local currency.
Vicki Hill, Pepsi-Cola International's US-based telecommunications manager,
says the messaging system offers higher speeds and more flexibility than the
company's current messaging system. It will also cost Pounds 3.5m less over
five years.
In addition, she expects e-mail to replace some telephone calls, especially
across time zones.
