FT  18 FEB 94 / Moscow to accept all drugs approved and made in US
Russia's health ministry has agreed to accept all drugs approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration and manufactured in the US without additional
clinical testing or analysis.
The move is expected to open the door to the Russian market for
pharmaceutical companies that have often found Russian authorisation for
their products long, costly and unpredictable.
Despite the requirement that the drugs be made in the US - intended to
insure that the production facilities are under FDA supervision - the
agreement is unlikely to yield an immediate financial bonanza for
pharmaceutical manufacturers, because of Russia's economic problems.
It will, however, greatly improve access to some of the most important
medicaments for Russian patients.
Many drugs are scarce and unaffordable, contributing to severe outbreaks of
diseases such as diphtheria. Modern antibiotics are in particularly short
supply, with shortages exacerbated by the need to pay in hard currency for
medicines previously supplied by eastern European allies.
Only around 40 US drugs are currently approved for sale in Russia. Winning
that approval could take more than a year, and much longer if the Russian
health ministry decided to order its own clinical trials.
Although the US-Russian agreement works only one way, it may offer a glimpse
of greater future co-operation between government drug agencies in different
countries.
US manufacturers will receive approval for their products within 90 days of
submitting basic documentation.
The US, EU and Japan agreed in 1991 on guidelines aimed at harmonising their
drug approval procedures, so that companies could conduct a single set of
clinical trials that could be used in winning authorisation in each country.
