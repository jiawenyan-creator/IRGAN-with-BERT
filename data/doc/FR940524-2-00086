 

As an example, the CSE asserts that it has responded to the industry's need for better risk management tools and technical
innovations. The CSE states that it initiated customized supervisory reports, batch transmission capability and
next-morning electronic access to disposition reports. The CSE believes that these enhancements help to create
a more efficient and orderly marketplace.

 Likewise, Lehman Brothers asserts that the NYSE replaced a cumbersome and manually intensive processing system
only after competing automated systems had been developed by the CSE and the CHX.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 Both the CHX and CSE point out that they have expended considerable expense and effort to develop a computerized extension
processing system.

See Lehman Brothers Letter,

 note 11. The letter states that while Lehman Brothers submits its extension requests to the NYSE, it has clearly benefited
from the competition between the exchanges and the NASD in the form of improved services.

Various commenters assert that by contributing to the NYSE's overall monopolistic position within the national
marketplace, the proposal will seriously impair other SROs' ability to complete with the NYSE. For example, both
the CSE and PSE state that the anti-competitive effects of this proposal go beyond extension processing services
to impact on the larger concept of the entire regulatory package of services that each exchange can provide, which
is one of the factors that firms look at when considering membership and the routing of order flow.

Some commenters assert that the NYSE's concerns could be addressed, and the anti-competitive effects diminished,
through less restrictive means. Some of these commenters suggest that the regulatory objectives could be met through
the development of uniform industry standards for processing extension requests and by formalizing information
sharing arrangements.

e.g.,

 January 1989 and July 1989 CSE Letters; 1989 CHX Letter; 1989 PSE Letter, 

supra

 note 9, and Lehman Brothers Letter, 

supra

 note 11. The CSE, PSE, CHX and Lehman Brothers Letters all state that information sharing would be the appropriate
alternative to the proposal. The CSE, for example, states that it shares all of its extension processing information
with the DEAs.

</FOOTNOTE>


In addition to information sharing, commenters suggest that uniform industry standards for processing extension
requests could ameliorate the NYSE's concerns. The CSE suggests that the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG''),
in cooperation with the Commission, should develop uniform industry standards for the processing of extensions
since, currently, there is no recognized way to evaluate individual extension requests.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 The NASD suggests that broker-dealers should be able to submit extension requests to any SRO as long as there are comparable
review criteria and the SRO has policies and procedures that make regulatory use of the data.
