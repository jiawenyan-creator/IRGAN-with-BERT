PATRIOTIC LANDLORD: The Irvine Co. is telling managers of its 9,000 rental 
units to reduce rents by $100 a month for any military reservist called up for 
more than two weeks as a result of the Mideast crisis, to permit conversion of 
long-term leases to monthly rentals and to refund all but $99 of security 
deposits. . . . "We believe there might be a financial burden on anybody called 
up," company spokesman Mike Stockstill said. "We believe it's the appropriate 
thing to do." Jeffrey A. Perlman and Tom Hamilton
