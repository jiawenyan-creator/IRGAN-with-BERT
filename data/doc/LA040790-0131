DRUG KINGS THREATEN COLOMBIAN VIOLENCE 
Colombia's drug barons stated Friday that they would step up their war against 
political and industrial leaders and said their escalation was prompted by the 
torture and murder of their colleagues. 
The drug traffickers, known as Extraditables because they are wanted in the 
United States, said fighting the government's policy of extradition was no 
longer their main concern. 
"Our principal motive for war will be the torture, murder and disappearance of 
our colleagues," they said in a statement. 
Referring to the gunning down of at least 14 police officers in the cocaine 
capital of Medellin this week, the drug barons said they would order the 
suspension of executions of police who had never taken part in torture.
