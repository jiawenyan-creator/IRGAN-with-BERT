NBC SUES SONY/COLUMBIA IN VIDEO 'PLOT' 
In an unusual lawsuit between two entertainment giants, National Broadcasting 
Co. charges that Sony Corp. and its Columbia Pictures Entertainment unit have 
secretly undermined an 8-year-old home video distribution venture. 
In a suit filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, NBC claims that 
Sony/Columbia has been hampering RCA/Columbia Home Video, a 50-50 joint venture 
set up by NBC and Columbia in 1982. The network claims that Sony/Columbia, by 
negotiating for home video rights behind the network's back, wants to set up 
its own home video distribution company to the detriment of the joint venture. 
The joint venture has two years remaining before it expires, and it holds the 
rights to over 500 titles beyond mid-1992. 
In particular, NBC points to a deal struck last month in which Columbia will 
distribute Orion Pictures' next 50 films overseas in both theatrical and 
home-video markets. Columbia advanced Orion $175 million for the rights. 
NBC claims Columbia balked at the Orion package when it was first presented to 
the joint venture. Three previous agreements to distribute Orion titles have 
been highly profitable for the joint venture, NBC said, but Columbia management 
blocked approval of a fourth package because it was secretly trying to funnel 
the Orion films into its own future home-video operation. 
According to NBC's suit, the value of the joint venture is being hurt by 
Columbia's actions and by perceptions that the home video company will be 
"winding down" as the expiration date approaches. The network claims damages of 
at least $250 million and says the actual cost could be more than $500 million. 
The lawsuit also describes a deteriorating and increasingly mistrustful 
relationship between the partners, including NBC preventing joint venture 
employees from traveling to London for a meeting with Columbia and Sony 
representatives to discuss the venture's operations. The network says Sony and 
Columbia officials tried to misappropriate confidential financial information 
from joint venture employees. 
A Sony spokesman declined comment and said the company has not yet seen the 
lawsuit. But the company issued a statement that "the lawsuit is surprising 
because Columbia and NBC have enjoyed a good relationship." 
Just how good is abundantly clear from disclosures made in the lawsuit. NBC 
says that the joint venture generated profits of more than $74 million in 1989 
on worldwide revenues of $470 million. The joint venture was described as 
having 400 employees and a payroll of $20 million. NBC estimates the "overall 
value" of the company to be more than $1 billion. 
Tom Adams, a home-video analyst with Paul Kagan Associates, a Carmel-based 
media investment firm, said the joint venture is ranked seventh among home 
video companies, behind all the majors with the exception of Orion. He 
estimated that domestic revenue has been flat over the past two years because 
the joint venture, with the exception of "Ghostbusters II," has not released 
any blockbusters. 
Although Sony and Columbia representatives denied that the companies have ever 
stated they intend to launch a new home video arm, as NBC alleges in its 
lawsuit, Adams nonetheless says "that's always been the speculation, and 
privately I've heard that."
