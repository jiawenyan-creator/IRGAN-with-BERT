FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: Downturn in CGIP's annual
earnings
COMPAGNIE Generale d'Industrie et de Participations (CGIP), the French
holding group controlled by the Wendel steel family, yesterday reported a
slight decline in net annual earnings.
The group, a big shareholder in both CMB Packaging, the Franco-British
packaging group and in Cap Gemini Sogeti, Europe's leading provider of
computer services, saw provisional net income decline to FFr664mm (Dollars
118.57m) last year from FFr698m in 1990.
This was 'a stable performance in a difficult economic environment', said Mr
Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, CGIP's chairman.
It reflected an improvement from CMB Packaging, soon to be renamed Carnaud
Metal Box after the companies described by its initials, a downturn at Cap
Gemini Sogeti, and the absence of a large exceptional gain made from an
asset sale in 1990, he said.
New management had moved into place smoothly at CMB, after last year's
change of chairman, and co-operation with the British shareholders was good,
said Mr Seilliere. CGIP was 'a faithful shareholder' in CMB and expected
fresh progress from the group, he said.
