FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Growth slackens at Toys R Us
Weak demand in its international stores held back the pace of profits growth
to 7 per cent at Toys R Us, the US toy retailer, in the second quarter to
July.
Net earnings rose from Dollars 35.5m in the comparable period to Dollars 38m
on turnover up by 10 per cent to Dollars 1.45bn from Dollars 1.32bn.
Earnings per share, boosted by the company's share repurchase programme,
rose by 8 per cent to 13 cents from 12 cents.
Mr Michael Goldstein, chief executive, said US toy stores achieved sales
growth of 2.2 per cent for the quarter on a store-for-store basis, with
strong increases in basic toy merchandise.
By contrast, the international toy stores continued to suffer from local
economic conditions and reported sales decreases on a store-for-store basis,
except in Canada.
For the first six months, sales were 12 per cent ahead at Dollars 2.91bn
while net profits were 7 per cent up at Dollars 75.6m, and earnings per
share were 8 per cent ahead at 26 cents.
Mr Goldstein said the company planned to open about 40 toy stores in the US
and 60 internationally this year.
