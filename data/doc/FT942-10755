FT  09 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Kays Food relaunches flotation proposals
Kays Food Group, the meat processing company, has decided to relaunch its
flotation plans, after proposals to expand the group through a takeover fell
through, writes Simon Davies.
Kays produces brand name cooked and processed meats, with a clientele which
includes Fortnum &amp; Mason and British Rail.
The company has trodden a tangled path towards listing. It first planned a
reverse takeover of textile and leisure company Noble Raredon, which is
controlled by Asil Nadir's sister Bilge Nevzat.
This was followed by proposals for a straight placing in March, but these
were dropped, following takeover talks with another meat processing company.
Given the falling stock market and diminished investor appetite for
flotations, Kays has scaled back its demands on new shareholders. It is
issuing 50m new shares at 5p to raise Pounds 2.1m net of expenses.
It initially planned to raise around Pounds 4.5m. This included the sale of
an additional 22m shares by Mr Fred Andrew, Kays' founder, who has now
decided to retain his stake. Kays will have a market capitalisation of
Pounds 4m.
The capital raised will help fund a Pounds 2.3m factory near Milton Keynes,
which will boost capacity from 3,000 tonnes to 15,000 tonnes per annum.
The company is already facing capacity constraints, but the new production
plant will not come on stream until the 1995-96 year.
Sponsor to the new shares is English Trust.
