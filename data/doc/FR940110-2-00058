OMB Number: 

None.



Title: 

Implementation of sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act, GN Docket No. 93252, First Report and Order.



Action: 

New collection.



Respondents: 

Individuals or households, state or local governments, federal agencies or employees, non-profit institutions
and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses).



Frequency of Response: 

One time filing requirement due by February 10, 1994.



Estimated Annual Burden: 

50 responses; 2 hours average burden per response; 100 hours total annual burden.



Needs and Uses: 

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 10366, title VI, section 6002(b), 107 Stat. 312,
395 (1993), amended sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 153(n) and 332, to
create a comprehensive regulatory framework for all mobile radio services. Under the amended statute, certain private
land mobile radio licensees will be reclassified as ``commercial mobile radio service'' licensees and will be treated
as common carriers subject to the foreign ownership and control restrictions of section 310(b) of the Communications
Act. A ``grandfathering'' provision, however, in new section 332(c)(6) permits the Commission to grant waivers
of section 310(b) to private land mobile licensees that petition the Commission by February 10, 1994. This present
action clarifies the filing procedures for such petitions and reminds all potentially affected private radio licensees
of the February 10, 1994 filing deadline. The Commission will use the waiver petitions to determine whether each given
petitioner should be permitted to retain foreign ownership or control, pursuant to statute.
