METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANOTHER MEDFLY FOUND IN SILVER LAKE 
A second Mediterranean fruit fly has been found in the Silver Lake area, but 
there are no plans to begin aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion, county 
agricultural officials said Friday. 
Crews have put up additional traps that they will be check daily, Agricultural 
Commissioner Leon Spaugy said. They also will be sampling home-grown fruit in 
the area for the presence of larvae. 
The latest Medfly was trapped Wednesday, 13 days and about 1 1/2 miles from the 
Elysian Park area where the first fly was discovered, Spaugy said. 
"Before we get engrossed in a costly eradication project, we want to be certain 
we have an infestation," he said. "If we do pick up additional flies or find 
the presence of larvae, that would change the situation dramatically."
