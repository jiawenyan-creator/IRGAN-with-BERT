FT  18 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Celltech and British Biotech plan float in
next two years
CELLTECH AND British Biotechnology, the two largest UK-based biotechnology
companies, are both planning to float on the stock market within the next
two years. Both are losing money heavily and need new funds to bring
promising new products to market.
British Biotechnology, which turned over Pounds 5.2m in 1991 is likely to go
for a public listing in July this year if its institutional shareholders
agree at a meeting to be held on Wednesday this week.
The company is likely to be floated both in London and New York. It intends
to raise about Pounds 50m, giving the company a value of around Pounds 170m.
It has appointed the investment banks Kleinwort Benson in the UK and Morgan
Stanley in the US as advisers.
It will be the first UK biotechnology company to go public and the first to
attempt the trick job of floating simultaneously in the US and UK.
Celltech, which lost Pounds 6.58m in 1991 on a turnover of Pounds 17m is
planning to float no later than 1994. It has announced a deal with the Bayer
company of Germany through which Bayer will market a new Celltech drug for
the treatment of septic shock. The deal could be worth Pounds 25m over
several years.
Both companies need the proceeds of flotation to fund further research
especially as potential products enter the stage of complex clinical trials.
British Biotechnology, which lost Pounds 7.8m in 1991, points out that it is
a 'development stage company that does not yet market or sell pharmaceutical
products'.
In the five years since its formation, however, it has put together a
portfolio of potentially money-spinning products including an Aids vaccine,
an anti-cancer drug, a treatment for asthma and a drug for the control of
arthritis.
