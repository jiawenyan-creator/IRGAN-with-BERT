FT  30 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Divine help in the press box
Amid the crush of sweating hacks in the media centre at Giants Stadium, New
Jersey, a surreal sight: two nuns seated at a desk, happily watching the
Brazil-Sweden game on TV.
Sisters Marie France and Mary Francesca normally help run a soup kitchen
from a mission in Spanish Harlem, and were not at the stadium to save the
lost souls of the press room, though they would help if asked.
The two French nuns are working as offical interpreters, mostly with
French-speaking supporters and journalists. 'We like to help,' says Sister
Marie.
