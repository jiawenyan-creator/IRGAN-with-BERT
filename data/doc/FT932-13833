FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Insurance arm helps boost Sears,
Roebuck to Dollars 435m
A STRONG contribution from its Allstate insurance subsidiary helped Sears,
Roebuck, the US retailing and financial services group, to after-tax profits
of Dollars 435m in the first three months of 1993.
This compared with profits of Dollars 274.2m last year, before charges
related to accounting rule changes, which translated into earnings per share
of Dollars 1.13, against 75 cents. Group revenues increased from Dollars
11.02bn to Dollars 11.3bn.
However, on the troubled merchandising side, where Sears is attempting a
significant overhaul, the underlying improvement in profits was modest. This
division made a profit of Dollars 63.6m, on sales 2.1 per cent higher at
Dollars 6.11bn.
In the previous year, the loss before accounting changes was Dollars 23.8m,
but Sears suggested the comparable 1992 figure - after adjusting for a
restructuring charge and the impact of businesses which Sears is quitting -
was a profit of Dollars 51.7m.
Allstate, the property-casualty insurer, managed a strong advance in profits
from Dollars 255.3m a year ago to Dollars 320.1m, despite the storm damage
claims resulting from the severe winter weather.
Catastrophe losses were Dollars 224.6m, compared with Dollars 122.4m a year
earlier, but Allstate's underwriting loss still narrowed, from Dollars 218m
to Dollars 159.3m. Sears said yesterday the flotation of up to a 20 per cent
stake in Allstate is now scheduled for June.
The company's 'discontinued businesses' - which include the Dean Witter,
Discover operations, which are being spun off, and Coldwell Banker, which
Sears is in the throes of selling - contributed Dollars 118m, compared with
Dollars 144.1m last time.
K mart, the large discount retailer which also takes in several specialty
store chains, warned that earnings per share in the first quarter of 1993
would show a fall from last time's 26 cents.
It blamed the weather and said that it still expected higher earnings for
1993 overall.
