FT  20 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa golds rebound
Gold shares bounced higher in Johannesburg in line with stronger bullion
prices after three days of steady decline, but industrials remained
sluggish. Renewed foreign demand was seen, however, after the recent
selling. The overall index rose 52 to 5,440, industrials dipped 13 to 6,558
and golds rebounded 113 to 1,886.
Tobacco-related stocks displayed weakness following news that ANC health
officials were proposing a 100 per cent rise in cigarette prices, but
analysts noted that the government had yet to consider proposals.
Tobacco-based Remgro shed R1.75 to R30 in heavy trading. Remb Beheer dropped
R6 to R17.
De Beers was 25 cents lower at R107.50 after recent losses on the Nasdaq,
but Anglos rose R2 to R230. Gencor added 60 cents at R10.20, Richemont put
on 35 cents at R41 and SAB collected R1 at R99 after recent declines.
Samancor rose R7.50 to R52.50.
