  [Abstract] The rapidly deteriorating environmental 
conditions increase the urgency of research into the genetics of 
nitrogen fixing microorganisms, both free living and 
endorhizospheric, which are capable of 1) cloning the plant 
vessel bundles, making them exceptionally competitive with 
respect to the soil microflora, and 2) producing a natural plant 
growth stimulant, i.e., indolyl-3-acetic acid. The resulting 
attempts to clone pZE8 natural hsd plasmid replicon-based 
cloning vectors for Escherichia coli and 
endorhizosphere nitrogen fixer Klebsiella oxytoca 
VN13 are outlined. The source materials and cloning procedure 
are described in detail. The pKAS18 and pKAS19B vectors 
constructed on the basis of the replicon of the natural hsd 
Citrobacter freundii plasmid and the pUC18 and pUC19 
polylinkers have a selective stability marker for kanamycine; 
tests show that that 96% Cm[.sup]R[/] and 98% 
Tc[.sup]R[/] of the resulting clones are stable to this 
antibiotic. The pMG1k and pMG21k plasmids are shown to be 
suitable fore cloning PstI DNA fragments, e.g., developing 
genome libraries of microorganisms; moreover, the pMG21k plasmid 
has unique restriction sites SmaI/XmaI in the Km[.sup]r[/] 
gene an Sall and EcoRV in the Tc[.sup]r[/] gene. The latter 
sites may be used for cloning employing direct recombinant 
molecule selection. The vectors are characterized by an elevated 
stability and are suitable for genetic engineering modification 
of Klebsiella oxytoca VN13 endorhizosphere nitrogen 
fixer. Figures 4; references 18: 9 Russian, 9 Western.
