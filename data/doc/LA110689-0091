BRIEFLY 
Gas Prices Continue to Slide: A gallon of gasoline costs nearly a penny less 
than it did two weeks ago, thanks to a seasonal downward push and a rise in 
crude oil production, said Trilby Lundberg, who surveys prices at 12,000 
stations nationwide. Between Oct. 20 and Nov. 3, the price of an average gallon 
of gasoline fell 0.95 cents to 108.16 cents. The drop was about twice that 
which occurred in the prior two-week period, said Lundberg.
