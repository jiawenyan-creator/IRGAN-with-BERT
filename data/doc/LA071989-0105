BRIEFLY 
Santa Fe to Cut Staff: Santa Fe Railway announced that it is cutting its staff 
by about 450 people, from clerical workers to upper-level management, as part 
of a plan to streamline operations. President Michael R. Haverty said nearly 
all of the reductions would be made through voluntary severance and early 
retirement, "although there will be a limited number of involuntary 
separations." All of the positions being eliminated are non-union jobs.
