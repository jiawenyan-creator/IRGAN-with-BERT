FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: French purchase for John Brown associate
John Brown, the engineer-ing group owned by Trafalgar House, yesterday
announced a further move to strengthen its growing operations on the
Continent, writes Andrew Taylor.
Sofresid, a French engineering company 49 per cent owned by John Brown, is
understood to have paid more than Pounds 5m for Sechaud &amp; Bossoyt, a French
engineering design group. The company was the prime contractor in the recent
reconditioning of the Eiffel Tower.
Mr Allan Gormly, managing director of John Brown and a Trafalgar House
director, said that the purchase would give the group a very strong position
in the French market.
Sechaud has 450 employees with offices in Paris and 11 provincial towns and
has a turnover of about Pounds 30m, Mr Gormly said. This compared with a
staff of 2,600 and turnover of Pounds 240m at Sofre-sid.
John Brown, in addition to its French operations, has a wholly-owned
subsidiary in the Netherlands and a joint venture with Sener, a Spanish
engineering company.
