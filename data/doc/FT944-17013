FT  11 OCT 94 / Eurotunnel in 'strong start'
Eurotunnel said yesterday that its shuttle freight service had made a strong
start in its first two months of operations, but ferry companies denied that
it had made any inroads into their cross-Channel business.
Mr Christian Zbylut, Eurotunnel freight director, said shuttle freight
trains had carried up to 350 trucks a day, equivalent to 12 per cent of the
Dover-Calais market, and were well placed to achieve the target of 22 per
cent of the cross-Channel freight market by the end of next year.
Eurotunnel is offering 34 departures a day in each direction. This will rise
to 50 departures in early December.
The freight shuttle was used by 450 customers on a regular basis last month.
Among big customers of the service are Securicor Omega Express
International, which has replaced airborne deliveries with tunnel services.
Eurotunnel said it was not challenging the ferries on fares and its prices
were 5 per cent to 10 per cent higher than the ferries because it offered
the advantage of speed and reliability. Tariffs are negotiated individually
with hauliers. A typical price per truck to regular users was about Pounds
200 compared with Pounds 390 for a one-off journey.
The ferry companies retorted that their freight shipments were increasing
and there was no sign of Eurotunnel taking away any of their business. Stena
Sealink said there had been 'absolutely no impact' on its Dover-Calais and
Dover-Dunkirk traffic. Hauliers attracted by Eurotunnel's initial discounts
had return-ed to the ferries, it said.
