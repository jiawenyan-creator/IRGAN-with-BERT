 Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

 Notice of public meeting.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is announcing regional meetings to discuss options for addressing certain
concerns expressed by a number of States in comments submitted to the NRC on the proposed rule on the environmental
review required for renewal of nuclear power plant operating licenses. The concerns that will be addressed involve
provisions of the proposed rule that the States see as being in conflict with the traditional authority of the States
to regulate electrical utilities with respect to questions of need, reliability, cost, resource options, and other
non-safety aspects of nuclear power generation. The minutes will be transcribed by a court recorder in all regional
meetings.

 
</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 The dates of the regional meetings are: Rockville, MD, February 9, 1994; Rosemont, IL, February 15, 1994; Chicopee,
MA, February 17, 1994. Parties interested in participating in a panel should contact Donald P. Cleary no later than
January 28, 1994. Written comments on the matters covered in the staff paper and the meetings that are received by March
4, 1994 will be considered along with comments made during the meetings. Comments received after this date will be
considered if it is practical to do so.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The purpose of the regional meetings is to gain the views of the States and other interested parties on how the NRC should
treat need for generating capacity and alternative energy sources in its final rule on the environmental review for
renewal of nuclear power plant operating licenses. The NRC published in the 

Federal Register

 proposed amendments to its environmental protection regulations, 10 CFR part 51, which would establish new requirements
for the environmental review of applications to renew operating licenses for nuclear power plants (September 17,
1991; 56 FR 47016). Concurrently, the NRC published NUREG1437, a draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement
(GEIS) that contained the analyses which the NRC proposed to codify in part 51. The public comment period on the proposed
rule, the GEIS, and other related documents closed on March 17, 1992. In commenting on the proposed rule and the draft
GEIS, a number of States expressed dissatisfaction with the treatment of need for generating capacity, and alternative
energy sources. The States' concerns involve provisions of the proposed rule that the States see as being in conflict
with the traditional authority of the States to regulate electrical utilities with respect to questions of need,
reliability, cost, resource options, and other non-safety aspects of nuclear power generation. The Commission
instructed the NRC staff to develop options for responding to these State concerns. In developing the options the
staff is to solicit the views of the States. 


The staff is soliciting the views of the States through four regional meetings and a request for written comments.
To facilitate discussions with the States the staff has prepared a paper, ``Addressing the Concerns of States and
Others Regarding the Role of Need for Generating Capacity, Alternative Energy Sources, Utility Costs, and Cost-Benefit
Analysis in NRC Environmental Reviews for Relicensing Nuclear Power Plants: An NRC Staff Discussion Paper,'' which
may be either examined at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20037, or obtained
from Donald P. Cleary at the address provided above. 
Each meeting will be conducted in a panel format with panelists representing those States that submitted comments
on the treatment of need for generating capacity and alternative energy sources, other interested States, electric
utilities, the NRC, and interest groups concerned with the economic regulation of electric utilities. All interested
persons are invited to attend as observers and time will be scheduled to take questions and comments from the floor.
The meeting minutes will be transcribed by a court reporter. Written comments on the matters covered in the staff paper
and the meetings are invited. The public comment period will close on March 4, 1994. 
Each meeting will begin at 10 a.m. and, with a 1 hour lunch break, will continue until 5 p.m. if participation warrants.
Registration will be conducted one-half hour prior to the meeting.

 

Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 11th day of January 1994.
