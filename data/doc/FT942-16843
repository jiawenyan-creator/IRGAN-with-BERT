FT  08 APR 94 / Powers of KwaZulu under fire
Prospects for a negotiated resolution of South Africa's political crisis
receded last night after the African National Congress called for withdrawal
of the powers of the KwaZulu 'homeland' government.
There were signs of a further clampdown yesterday when troops of the
newly-formed National Peacekeeping Force were deployed for the first time in
townships near Johannesburg. A BBC correspondent saw 40 of the distinctive
light blue vehicles of the force move into east Rand townships.
The force was formed two months ago by integrating elements of the South
African Defence Force, the ANC's armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), and the
armies of black homelands, and has been plagued by ill discipline. MK
members are to start assembling next week for integration into the new South
African armed forces, said Mr Siphiwe Nyanda, MK chief of staff.
The ANC said it would 'not surrender to attempts to blackmail the people of
South Africa into accepting postponement of the elections through the
creation of a climate of rising violence and terror.'
The statement will do little to improve the mood at today's meeting between
President FW de Klerk, ANC leader Mr Nelson Mandela, Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini.
