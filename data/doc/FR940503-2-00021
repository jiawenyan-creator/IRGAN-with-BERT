SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Purpose


This clearance covers the extension of reporting requirements as required by 41 U.S.C. 253e on Certification of Commercial
Pricing. The clauses at FAR 52.21532 and 52.21535 require that offerors/contractors certify to the
best of their knowledge and belief that prices offered for certain spare or repair parts that the contractor offers
for sale to the public are no higher than the lowest commercial sales price at which such parts were sold during the most
recent regular monthly, quarterly, or other period for which sales data are reasonably available, provided that
in no event shall this period be less than 30 days in duration. All items for which prices offered are higher than the
lowest commercial sales price discussed above must be identified and a written justification for the differences
supplied.
The commercial pricing information is used by contracting officers to ensure that the Government does not pay prices
for commercial spare and repair parts that exceed the lowest commercial sales prices at which such items are sold by
the contractor to the general public unless the price differences are justified. Without the information, the Government
may pay prices for such supplies that are higher than prices paid by other customers.
