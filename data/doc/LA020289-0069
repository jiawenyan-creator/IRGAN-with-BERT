team whose New York City broadcasts for half a century turned her life into an 
ongoing soap opera. Mrs. Fitzgerald's career began in 1937 with a radio station 
owned by a Portland, Ore., department store where she worked. To fill air time, 
she began to broadcast from the store. Her husband was a newspaper reporter who 
had gone into radio in 1933 as a master of ceremonies. After they married, they 
went to New York, where she landed a job on WOR-AM doing a half-hour talk show 
on her lunch hour while working as a department store advertising manager. When 
Mrs. Fitzgerald caught pneumonia, she was asked to broadcast from her hospital 
bed and later from her home while she was convalescing. Because she did not 
want her announcer, Henry Morgan, to see her in a bathrobe, she asked if her 
husband, Edward, could take his place. The husband-wife combination became a 
radio first and was at one time heard by 2 million people in the New York area.
