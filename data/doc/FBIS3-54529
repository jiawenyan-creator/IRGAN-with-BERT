  [Text] Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu says he relayed a 
message to Jordan's King Husayn via Spain's King Juan Carlos 
when the latter visited Israel. He wrote the Jordanian king 
that he believes Israel and Jordan share a joint interest in 
opposing the establishment of a Palestinian state because it 
would conspire against the Hashemite court and seek to annex 
Jordan, and would later act against Israel. Moreover, Netanyahu 
wrote, Israel is interested in upholding the Hashemite regime in 
Jordan and in having a permanent arrangement in Judaea and 
Samaria that would maintain the link between the majority of the 
population there and Jordan. 
  Tzomet supports a peace agreement with Jordan based on the 
current situation. Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan told our 
correspondent Hayim Hecht that relations with Jordan in the last 
few years constitute a de facto peace agreement, which could now 
be given legal expression.
