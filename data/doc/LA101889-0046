CLU GIVES WESTMONT A SCARE, 3-2 
It was a typical freshman mistake. 
Apparently Alberto Gutierrez didn't realize that when the Cal Lutheran soccer 
team fell two goals behind the top-ranked team in the nation late in the second 
half it was time to go into the tank. 
No, with typical freshman vigor, he leaped high for a Larry Gidley pass near 
the goal and headed it in to pull Cal Lutheran (7-5-1) within a goal of 
visiting Westmont College (12-1-3) with five minutes remaining in Tuesday's 
game. 
Gutierrez's goal made the final score 3-2, but CLU managed to throw a scare 
into Westmont, tied for first in the National Assn. of Intercollegiate 
Athletics soccer poll with Rockhurst College of Missouri. 
"It's probably safe to say they play us as tough as anybody has played us all 
year," Westmont Coach Bob Fortosis said. "It's obvious we played pretty flat, 
but I don't know if it was because of their effort or because we came in 
cocky." 
Westmont jumped to a 1-0 lead and controlled the ball throughout the first 
half, but Cal Lutheran managed to scratch out a 1-1 first-half tie. Dave 
Rinehart kicked the ball into the right corner where Gidley tracked it down and 
crossed it to Casey Pirih, who drilled a line drive past diving goalie David 
Buehring for Cal Lutheran's goal. 
Early in the second half, Westmont's Justin Wall scored his second goal of the 
game when he hit the right post, rebounded his own shot and buried it in the 
net. 
Mike Avery scored minutes later to give Westmont a 3-1 lead. 
But Cal Lutheran refused to quit. 
"You expect that of them," Coach George Kuntz said. "Playing the No. 1 team in 
the nation, the players responded well." 
With only two more District 3 matches left, CLU needed a victory to improve its 
playoff hopes. Now, the Kingsmen (3-3-1 in district play) will have to beat Cal 
Baptist and Fresno Pacific to assure themselves of one of the five playoff 
berths.
