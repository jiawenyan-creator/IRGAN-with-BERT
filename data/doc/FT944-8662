FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Woolworth posts first net
profits in six quarters
Woolworth, the troubled US retailing group, yesterday pulled itself out of
six consecutive quarters of losses. It posted net profits of Dollars 37m in
the three months to October compared with net losses of Dollars 350m in the
same period last year.
However, the comparison was flattered by special provisions and one-time
charges that hit results in the third quarter of 1993. Excluding these, the
combined operating profits of the company's general merchandise and
specialty retailing divisions were little changed.
Woolworth has been cutting back its fading five-and-dime stores and
diversifying into specialty retailing. The strategy has failed to yield
results.
At the operating level, Woolworth said the specialty retailing operations
had increased profits to Dollars 95m from Dollars 61m and the general
merchandise operations had turned in a Dollars 9m profit in the latest
quarter from a Dollars 31m loss.
However, the 1993 figures included special provisions of Dollars 23m against
specialty retailing and Dollars 49m against general merchandise operations,
relating to workers' compensation and general liability insurance.
Without these, the comparison would have shown profits of the specialty
retailing rising less - to Dollars 95m from Dollars 84m - and profits of the
general merchandise operations declining to Dollars 9m from Dollars 18m.
The company took a restructuring charge in last year's third quarter to
cover 13,000 job cuts and closing 970 general merchandise stores in North
America. Without the charge, the comparable period's net losses would have
been Dollars 3m.
Total group revenues fell to Dollars 2.1bn from Dollars 2.39bn. Earnings per
share were 28 cents compared with losses per share of Dollars 2.66 last
time.
