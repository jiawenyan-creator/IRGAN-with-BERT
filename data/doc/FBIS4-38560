  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has said Ukraine 
will protect its territorial integrity and the inviolability of 
its borders under any circumstances. The president and the 
parliament of Ukraine will do everything in order to prevent a 
breach of territorial integrity, discuss all disputable issues 
with Crimea and settle the issue without conflicts, he pointed 
out at his joint news conference with Turkish President Suleyman 
Demirel in Kiev Tuesday. 
  Turkish President Suleyman Demirel is staying in Kiev on an 
official visit. 
  Kiev's ultimatum to Crimea demanding the Crimean legislature 
reconsider its decision to re-enact the Constitution of May 6 
1992 expired on May 30. The Constitution provides for dual 
citizenship and treaty-based relations between Ukraine and 
Crimea, which is unacceptable for Kiev. 
  Commenting on the situation in Crimea, Demirel described it 
as "Ukraine's internal affair" pointing out he had a high 
opinion of Leonid Kravchuk's position.
