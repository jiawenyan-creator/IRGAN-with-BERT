FT  20 DEC 94 / German TV station boosted
Vox, the ailing German television station in which Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation has a 49.9 per cent stake, will spend DM200m (Pounds 81.6m) on
its programming next year. The channel was started at the beginning of 1993
by Bertelsmann, the German media group, but went into liquidation last April
when a number of the original shareholders withdrew. Several of Germany's 16
state media authorities were reluctant to renew the Vox licence after the
channel went into liquidation, arguing that Mr Murdoch's arrival in July
meant the new shareholders and programme mix bore no resemblance to the
original channel. However, a spokesman for Vox, said the media regulators
had approved the new line-up.
