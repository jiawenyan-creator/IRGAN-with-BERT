FT  29 APR 93 / Negotiators on Hong Kong lower volume
BRITISH and Chinese negotiators said yesterday that talks in Beijing on Hong
Kong were proceeding normally, but they gave no indication whether progress
had been achieved.
The second round of talks is expected to conclude today, after which Mr
Jiang Enzhu, China's chief negotiator, will undertake a diplomatic mission
to Europe.
Sir Robin McLaren told reporters he had 'no quarrel' with Mr Jiang's use of
the the word 'normal' to describe initial talks. 'I think it is good that
these discussions can continue in the normal way,' Sir Robin said.
China's official press, however, indicated that little progress had been
achieved thus far. The English-language China Daily said there had been 'no
hint of progress from either side'.
The two sides have agreed to impose a news blackout on details of the talks
to avoid what has been described as 'microphone diplomacy'. That agreement
appears to have been honoured.
China, however, is continuing to assail Britain for reneging on prior
agreements on Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule in 1997. Beijing has
reacted furiously to proposals advanced by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's
governor, for a broadening of popular participation in the political process
in the lead-up to 1997.
China's official press has been urging Britain to 'return to the correct
path'. In early sparring, the two sides are thought to have spent much time
re-stating their own positions without engaging in negotiations as such.
No date has been set for a resumption of the talks, but Sir Robin indicated
that they would restart soon after Mr Jiang returned from Europe early next
month.
