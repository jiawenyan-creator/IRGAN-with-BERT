FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Unisys looks to cut costs after
further heavy losses
UNISYS, the struggling computer giant, reported continuing heavy losses for
its first quarter. It said it was 're-evaluating its plans' to reduce costs
by narrowing product lines and selling non-strategic assets.
Unisys said it still expected to reduce its debts, which stand at Dollars
3.43bn, by Dollars 600m this year. However, it acknowledged that this goal
would be harder to achieve than anticipated.
For the first quarter, Unisys reported a net loss of Dollars 98.2m, or 79
cents a share. Analysts had expected losses of around 62 cents a share. In
the first quarter a year ago, the company reported a net loss of Dollars
3.2m, or 19 cents. Revenue for the quarter fell to Dollars 2.06bn, from
Dollars 2.31bn in the same period a year ago.
'Our first-quarter results reflect our previously-announced projection of a
loss for the first quarter and a difficult first half,' said Mr James Unruh,
chairman and chief executive.
The company plans to maintain net worth in excess of Dollars 3.5bn as
required by its bankers.
Unisys said losses on a big government contract to supply desktop computers,
and the effect of government price controls in Brazil, hurt operating profit
in the quarter.
