FT  22 JUN 94 / Denmark makes fiscal pledge
A tighter fiscal policy and a reduced budget deficit in 1995 were promised
by the Danish government yesterday. Mr Paul Nyrup Rasmussen, the prime
minister, said after a routine cabinet meeting, at which the 1995 finance
bill was discussed, that the impact of government finances on the economy
next year will be to dampen the GDP growth rate by about 0.3 per cent. In
the current year, a strongly expansive fiscal policy is estimated to add 1.2
per cent to the growth rate, which is expected to be about 4 per cent. The
1995 finance bill will bring the budget deficit to under DKR50bn (Pounds
5bn), said Mr Rasmussen. The government's most recent estimate is that the
1994 deficit will be about DKR51bn, some 5.5 per cent of GDP, about the same
as in 1993.
