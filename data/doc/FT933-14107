FT  15 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
VOLUME showed more health in stock index futures as good UK inflation
figures and expectations of a German interest rate cut breathed a little
life into the market, Christine Buckley writes.
The better than expected inflation news encouraged investors to hope that a
UK interest rate cut may be, if not round the corner, possibly on the
horizon. Germany's cut, expected today, will add to the climate of
anticipation.
But as such hopes are long term, the volume in the September contract on the
FT-SE 100 - 7,564 at the close - did not translate into an upward movement
of the future, and it was kept in check ahead of Wall Street's opening. It
started the day at 2,837, and just before the US market began trading it set
the day's low of 2,830. A rally then pushed it up to 2,850 by mid-afternoon
 -a level which heralded the sellers. Their action took 10 points off to
leave September at a 2,840 close - 5 points down on the day.
The contract was just over a point ahead of its fair value premium to cash
of 7 points, although it had traded more convincingly ahead of that level
during the day.
In traded options, activity was strong in the Euro FT-SE option, which is
stimulated by the expiry tomorrow of the July contract. It traded 6,427
lots. Total volume was 26,932, against the previous day's 29,437, with the
FT-SE 100 option having 7,646 lots dealt.
