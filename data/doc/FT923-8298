FT  12 AUG 92 / Labour calls for benefits statement
LABOUR yesterday called for the government to clarify its policy on
unemployment benefit in the wake of newspaper reports that it plans to halve
the period for which benefit will be paid to six months, David Owen writes.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said such a move would
amount to 'a cynical cost-saving exercise'. The government 'should not try
to get themselves out of the economic mess they have created by attacking
the incomes of the unemployed'.
