BIG-RIG DRIVER ARRESTED AFTER 60-MILE CHASE 
The driver of a tractor-trailer truck was arrested Sunday on suspicion of 
assault with a deadly weapon after leading officers on a 60-mile chase that 
involved several minor accidents and the truck's crash on the Ventura Freeway 
in Camarillo, authorities said. 
The driver, whose identity was withheld, was arrested after slamming into a 
light pole on the westbound freeway near Camarillo Springs Road, said 
California Highway Patrol Officer Robert Bruce. 
It was not immediately known if the driver of the truck was injured in the 
crash, Bruce said. 
The incident began about 7:40 p.m. when the Western Mayflower moving van hit a 
parked car in Glendora, Bruce said. When the truck failed to stop, the car's 
driver followed the truck onto the westbound Foothill Freeway, he said. 
Soon after, the California Highway Patrol became involved in the pursuit, he 
said. 
The chase continued to the westbound Ventura Freeway at speeds to 70 m.p.h., 
Bruce said. Several vehicles were reported hit by the truck, but no details 
were available about damage or injuries, he said. 
The chase ended when the driver of the truck lost control of the vehicle and 
smashed into the light pole about 8:30 p.m., Bruce said. The driver was 
arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and various other 
charges, Bruce said.
