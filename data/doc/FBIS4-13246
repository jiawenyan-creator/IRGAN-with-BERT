  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali said 
Jordan seeks a comprehensive peace settlement and has rejected a 
separate one because it will not be a permanent solution, and 
might also be more dangerous than having no solution at all. 
  The prime minister met today with the Jordanian journalists 
and columnists of the country's party press, and other daily 
newspapers. 
  The prime minister agreed that there could be a possible 
link 
between recent Israeli accusations to Jordan of encouraging 
terrorism and the blockade on the Gulf of Aqaba. 
  Prime Minister al-Majali indicated that Jordan is making 
contacts with a number of world countries to explain losses to 
the national economy as a result of the blockade. 
  The prime minister said Jordan believes in the need for 
further coordination among Arab parties to the peace 
negotiations with Israel. He said the Arab negotiators can be 
in a stronger position as the Arabs demonstrated a unity of 
stands. 
  The prime minister said Jordan's relationship with the 
Palestinians is very special, and the country deals with the PLO 
as the sole representative of the Palestinian people.
