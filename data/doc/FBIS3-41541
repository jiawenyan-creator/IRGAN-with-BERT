  [Text] Jinan, Nov 22 (XINHUA) -- Qingdao, one of China's 14 
open coastal cities, is improving its environment with foreign 
funds. 
  The largest industrial city in Shandong Province, Qingdao 
has 
experienced rising pollution along with its rapid economic 
development. 
  To eliminate the pollution, the city has set up a leading 
organization headed by the mayor to guide environmental 
protection work, using a total of 160 million U.S. dollars 
loaned or donated by foreign governments and organizations in 
this field over the past five years, accounting for one-third of 
its total funds in the same period. 
  At present, the city has completed construction of the third 
phase of gas supply facilities and a central heating project. 
It has transformed the Qingdao power generating plant 
technically and is building more anti-pollution projects. 
  Included is the Tuandao waste water treatment plant with a 
daily capacity of 100,000 tons of waste water. 
  Upon completion, a city official noted, these projects are 
expected to help improve urban environmental quality by reducing 
air and water pollution.
