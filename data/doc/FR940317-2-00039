SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On September 24, 1993 and September 29, 1993, petitions were submitted to the Environmental Appeals Board requesting
review of a PSD permit issued to SEI Birchwood, Inc. (SEI) for construction of a 220-megawatt coal-fired electric
generating facility in King George County, Virginia. These petitions were submitted by Sarah Nasta and Citizens
for Sensible Power (CSP), respectively. The PSD permit was issued by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality
(VDEQ) on August 23, 1993, pursuant to a delegation of authority from the EPA, Region III, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Because of the delegation, any PSD permit issued by the VDEQ is an EPA-issued permit for purposes of federal law (40
CFR 124.41; 45 FR 33413 (May 19, 1980)), and is subject to review by the Agency under 40 CFR 124.19 before becoming final.




The Environmental Appeals Board issued an Order Denying Review of the permit on January 27, 1994, concluding that
review of VDEQ'S permit determination was not warranted and that it met all necessary requirements of federal law.



Anyone wishing to review the final permit, petitions, Order Denying Review, or related materials should contact
one of the following offices:




U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,

Pursuant to 40 CFR 124.19(f)(2), for purposes of judicial review, final Agency action occurs when a final PSD permit
is issued and Agency review procedures are exhausted. This Notice, being published today in the 

Federal Register, 

constitutes notice of the final Agency action denying review of the PSD permit. If available, judicial review of these
determinations under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act (Act) may be sought only by the filing of a petition for
review in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit within 60 days from the date on which this determination
is published in the 

Federal Register. 

Under section 307(b)(2) of the Act, this determination shall not be subject to later judicial review in any civil or
criminal proceedings for enforcement.
