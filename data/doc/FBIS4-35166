  [Text] On 29 June, the European Union [EU] granted $11.5 
million in humanitarian aid to Cuba. This decision was reached 
following a visit to Cuba by experts from the European Union 
last March. 
  The financial aid will be managed by nongovernmental 
organizations who work with the EU, and will be allocated as 
follows: 
  1. Two million dollars will be used to purchase and 
distribute medicine and raw materials to produce the neovitamin 
tablets used against optical neuritis. 
  2. Four million dollars will be used to stock hospitals 
with medical supplies such as sheets, hygiene products, and 
surgical, orthopedic, and sanitary supplies. 
  3. Eight thousand dollars will be used for drinking-water 
purification. 
  4. The rest will be used to acquire and distribute food 
staples such as powdered milk, oil, cheese, canned meat and 
fish, fruits, vegetables, and baby food. 
  The EU's aid will be distributed according to regional 
mortality indexes, and urban population density.
