FT  07 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Irn-Bru helps lift AG Barr
AG BARR, the Glasgow-based soft drinks manufacturer, lifted pre-tax profits
by Pounds 369,000 to Pounds 4.75m in the year to October 26, a 'more than
satisfactory result', according to Mr Robin Barr, chairman.
Trading profits were down at Pounds 5.66m (Pounds 6.03m). But lower net
interest, dividend received of Pounds 1.51m (Pounds 1.64m), and an
exceptional credit of Pounds 601,000 from a settled fire insurance claim,
boosted the pre-tax figure.
Turnover rose fractionally to Pounds 90m (Pounds 89.8m), reflecting, Mr Barr
said, a poor second half because of 'the disappointing summer weather, the
rise in VAT and the recessionary conditions'. All these factors, as well as
the fragility of consumer confidence, had an effect on the market, he said.
Sales of the Barr brands continued to grow, due to improved distribution and
the greater public awareness - particularly in the case of Irn-Bru -
resulting from higher marketing expenditure.
Below the line there was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 962,000 (Pounds
511,000) representing the final cost of restructuring the company's
production and distribution arrangements.
Earnings rose to 17.28p (16.03p) and a final dividend of 4.3767p makes a
5.46p (5.2p) total.
