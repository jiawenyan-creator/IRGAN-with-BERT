LOYOLA'S FRYER WILL SPEAK AT ALL-STAR BANQUET 
Jeff Fryer, a senior guard at Loyola Marymount, will be the guest speaker at 
the Orange County all-star basketball game banquet at 6:15 p.m. Sunday at the 
Irvine Marriott. 
Fryer established an NCAA tournament record this season when he made 11 
three-point shots in Loyola's 149-115 victory over defending champion Michigan 
at the Long Beach Arena. Fryer scored 41 points in the game. 
Fryer played at Corona del Mar High School before attending Loyola and played 
for the South team in the 1986 all-star game.
