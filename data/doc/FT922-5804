FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Rayon and Teijin fall
sharply
MITSUBISHI Rayon and Teijin, two of Japan's leading synthetic fibre makers,
yesterday reported lower pre-tax profits for the year to end-March.
Mitsubishi Rayon's pre-tax earnings fell by 23 per cent to Y9.5bn (Dollars
73.6m) because of a growing deficit in financial items. Net profit dropped
by 30.8 per cent to Y4.2bn.
It was Mitsubishi Rayon's first profit decline since 1987, and the company
expects earnings to slide further to Y8bn this fiscal year. Net profit is
also predicted to tumble to Y4bn in the current year.
Sales fell by 1 per cent to Y272.5bn due to slow turnover in the non-fibre
business, particularly resins. A slight recovery is expected this year.
Teijin blamed its 22.3 per cent fall in pre-tax earnings to Y26.7bn on
stagnant sales of non-fibre products.
Sales during the last fiscal year rose by 4.1 per cent to Y339.1bn and are
expected to increase to Y350bn this year.
Net profit decreased by 26.7 per cent to Y14.8bn and is expected to fall to
Y11bn.
