FT  01 MAR 93 / International Company News: Rising exports give lift to
South Korean electronics
HIGHER sales of semi-conductors and increased exports of consumer
electronics led to South Korea's four main electronics companies all
reporting growth in turnover and profits for 1992.
The continued growth of the Korean economy, although weakening, is another
reason for their improved profitability in contrast to their Japanese
rivals, which are suffering from the effects of a domestic recession.
Combined profits among the four electronics manufacturers jumped by 70.2 per
cent to Won125.5bn (Dollars 157.8m), while sales rose by 11.9 per cent to
Won12,600bn. However, 1993 results could be much lower if the US decides in
favour of imposing dumping duties on Korean chips, which would severely
curtail exports to its largest overseas market.
Samsung Electronics, Korea's largest electronics company, reported a 5.5 per
cent increase in net profits to Won72.4bn, while sales rose by 16.6 per cent
to Won6,100bn.
Sales of its semiconductor division, which is the world's fifth-largest
producer of memory chips, grew by 25 per cent to Won1,340bn, and provided
most of the group's profits. The consumer electronics division's sales were
up 10 per cent at Won3,300bn. Sales for the computer and telecommunications
division rose by 29 per cent to Won1,430bn.
Earnings at Goldstar jumped by 43.2 per cent to Won26.5bn, although sales
only grew by 2.9 per cent to Won3,780bn.
The improvement was mainly due to exports, which grew by 7.6 per cent to
Won2,000bn. Sales were brisk in south-east Asia and Latin America, where
Goldstar has increased marketing efforts to counter weakening exports to
North America.
Domestic sales slipped by 2 per cent to Won1,780bn, which Goldstar blamed on
depressed consumer spending caused by slower economic growth.
Daewoo Electronics posted a 22 per cent increase in profits to Won16.6bn,
while sales rose by 9.6 per cent to Won1,700bn.
Daewoo said it performed particularly well in the domestic market in spite
of the general slowdown in consumer spending because of the introduction of
new products, especially washing machines and televisions. Domestic sales
rose by 16.6 per cent to Won664.4bn.
Hyundai Electronics, which suffered a loss of Won27bn in 1991, reported a
profit of Won10bn as sales grew by 25 per cent to Won1,030bn. The recovery
was largely caused by increased sales of semiconductors, with exports up 60
per cent to Won500bn.
