FT  16 FEB 94 / Mercury rapped for advert
Telephone price wars will take a new twist today as the Advertising
Standards Authority upholds a complaint by British Telecommunications about
Mercury claims.
BT complained about two newspaper advertisements in which Mercury compared
call charges in 1982 and 1993.
One stated that by 1993 Mercury had become 'best known for driving down the
cost of everybody's long distance and international calls by an average of
40 per cent'.
BT said the advertisement failed to acknowledge that other factors, such as
tighter government controls over BT's prices and changes in the regulation
of international calls, had played a part in the reduction of charges.
Mercury said only one ruling in 1991 by Oftel, the telecommunications
regulator, concerning international calls, had directly affected BT's
charges.
The ASA said Mercury 'went too far in implying that Mercury was the sole
reason for the reduction in BT's call charges'.
The authority was happy, however, with the wording of another Mercury
advertisement which stated that the company 'is known by . . . businesses .
. . as the one who helped them reduce their phone bills'.
Mercury was also criticised by the ASA for failing to state clearly that the
price comparisons had been adjusted for inflation. Beecham Group has been
told by the ASA to state the sugar content of Ribena Sugar Free drink in
future advertisements. The authority upheld A complaint by the pressure
group Action and Information on Sugars about a poster for the drink which
read: 'Sugar Free. Out Now.'
Beecham argued that after dilution as directed, the product contained 0.476g
of sugar per 100ml, which counted as 'sugar-free' under a draft EC
directive.
