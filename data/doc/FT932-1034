FT  25 JUN 93 / People: Rowlands takes on top job at HTV
Chris Rowlands, the 41-year old finance director of HTV, the ITV company for
Wales and the west of England was yesterday appointed chief executive with
immediate effect.
He takes over from Charles Romaine, 56, who was with HTV for two years and
successfully saw it through the bids for new franchises. It is believed that
Louis Sherwood, the HTV chairman sought Romaine's early retirement.
The appointment reflects the changing nature of independent television and
the hard struggle HTV faces following its high bid of Pounds 20.5m a year to
retain its franchise.
Rowlands, a qualified accountant with a Cambridge economics degree, is a
specialist in ITV advertising.
He joined HTV as finance director in May 1992 and had previously worked at
the Asda retail group. His responsibilities at Asda included devising and
implementing corporate property plans and managing new construction of about
Pounds 300m a year and Pounds 1.5bn of Asda property assets.
At HTV Rowlands has been responsible for cost-cutting and rationalisation
aimed at taking the company back to profit.
Sherwood yesterday paid tribute to Romaine's role in steering HTV through
the bid process against fierce competition and launching the policy of
selling non-core businesses and reducing the company's cost base. Rowlands
said he was confident HTV would be able to honour fully its licence
obligations.
He added: 'My immediate task is to ensure that HTV repays the loyalty of its
shareholders by returning the company to profitability.'
