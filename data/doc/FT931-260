FT  31 MAR 93 / Barracks raid leaves 41 dead
Algerian security forces claimed last night they had tracked down and killed
23 Moslem fundamentalists who last week raided an army barracks, killing 18
soldiers, Reuter reports from Algiers.
Another 12 fundamentalists were on the run, the gendarmerie added.
It said the raiders took weapons from the Bougzoul barracks, 100km south of
Algiers, after breaking in with help from four sympathetic soldiers.
The attackers killed eight soldiers while gaining access to the arms depot,
and then shot dead 10 more servicemen. They escaped in a waiting truck and
two vans, but were later spotted by an aircraft and intercepted.
A state of emergency was imposed in Algeria in February last year following
the election victory of the now outlawed fundamentalist Islamic Salvation
Front. More than 600 people have died in the past year, nearly half of them
members of the security forces.
