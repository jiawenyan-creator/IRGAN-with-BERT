SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking concerning this regulation in the 

Federal Register

 on June 7, 1994 (59 FR 29403). Interested persons were requested to submit comments and none were received. The 60-day
comment period ended on August 8, 1994.



Drafting Information


The drafters of this notice are QM2 Gregory C. Garrison, project officer, Boating Affairs Branch, Fifth Coast Guard
District, and LCDR Christopher Abel, project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Staff.



Background and Purpose



The Ocean City Offshore Grand Prix, sponsored by the United States Offshore Racing Association is an annual event
held on the Atlantic Ocean off of Ocean City. As part of the application, the sponsor requested that the Coast Guard
provide control of spectator and commercial traffic within the regulated area.



Discussion of Regulations



This regulation will regulate the area surrounding the Ocean City Offshore Grand Prix race course on the Atlantic
Ocean off of Ocean City. The course runs from Ocean City Inlet to Maryland Beach. To provide for the safety of participants,
spectators, and vessels transiting the area, the Coast Guard will restrict vessel movement in the regulated area.
A temporary spectator anchorage area will be established for what is expected to be a large spectator fleet. Coast
Guard patrol vessels will be positioned at Ocean City Inlet to direct vessels around the regulated area, or to the temporary
spectator anchorage area. The sponsor usually provides 29 vessels to assist the Coast Guard and local government
agencies in patrolling the event. Medical vessels will display fluorescent orange placards, and patrol boats will
display fluorescent green placards.

Good cause exists for making this rule effective less than thirty days from the date of publication because the Coast
Guard did not have adequate time after the required comment period for this rule to publish the rule more than thirty
days before this year's event.



Regulatory Evaluation



This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. This regulation will only be in effect for three hours, and the impacts on routine
navigation are expected to be minimal.



Small Entities



Because it expects the impact of this rule to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that this
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This proposed rule contains no collection of Information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

).



Federalism Assessment



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the final rule does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.



Environmental Assessment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under section 2.B.2.C of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and been placed in the rulemaking docket.
