FT  10 JUN 92 / ABB to run W Australia power plant
THE Swiss-Swedish group Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) has been commissioned to
develop and operate an ADollars 2bn (Pounds 800m) coal-fired power station
in Western Australia.
The 600 MW plant in Collie in the state's south-west region will be the
first big privately-funded and owned power station in Australia.
Much of the funding is due to be raised through the issue of special
infrastructure bonds to be arranged by the consortium's financial adviser,
Bankers Trust Australia. The bonds, which attract concessional tax rates,
were introduced by the Commonwealth government in February to encourage
private financing of large infrastructure projects.
The Collie plant was originally to have been developed by a syndicate led by
Australia's Transfield Group and Japan's Mitsubishi Corporation. The Western
Australia government awarded the mandate in October but withdrew it in April
when Mitsubishi Transfield failed to raise funding at rates that would
deliver its promised electricity prices.
