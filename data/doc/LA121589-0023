ENLARGING THE COUNTY BOARD 
Thank you for pointing out in your editorial ("Why the Gang of Five Isn't 
Enough," Dec. 6) that the current redistricting options being considered by the 
Board of Supervisors do not go far enough. We agree that five people cannot 
adequately represent the 8.5 million people of Los Angeles County and that the 
board must be enlarged. 
We also believe that the current structure deprives Los Angeles County of 
effective, accountable leadership and promotes waste and inefficiency. The 
Board of Supervisors (whatever its size) should not carry all the executive and 
legislative power to run the $9-billion enterprise that is county government. 
The Constitution requires other levels of government to separate those powers 
so that the public good is protected by a series of checks and balances. A 
strong countywide elected executive officer would provide leadership and 
accountability, and an enlarged board would provide better representation and 
more thorough, public deliberation of the issues facing this, the most diverse 
and populous county. 
The League of Women Voters calls upon the Board of Supervisors to stop wasting 
tax dollars fighting the lawsuit and agree to a settlement that enlarges the 
board (nine would be better than seven). At the same time, the board should 
place on the ballot a change in the charter to establish an elected county 
executive.
