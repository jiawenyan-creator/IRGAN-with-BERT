NEW LEGISLATION TO DEAL WITH HATE CRIMES IN UNITED STATES 
Roche would have us believe that racism and ethnic and religious bigotry have 
long since vanished from American society, evidenced by the fact that members 
of various groups are represented among the wealthy and that "even the chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is black." Is Roche thereby suggesting that as a 
result of the presence of blacks in high appointed offices and the acquisition 
of material success by some minorities that crimes should no longer concern us? 
Roche misinterprets the impetus for the Hate Crimes Statistics Act. Crimes 
impelled by bias have a special emotional and psychological impact on the 
victim and the victim's community. They can lead to the intimidation of others 
in that community, causing them to feel isolated and unprotected by the law. 
The damage done by bias crimes cannot be measured solely in terms of physical 
injuries or by dollars. 
Unfortunately, prejudice and hatred cannot be legislated or prosecuted out of 
existence, but at the very least, the enactment of this kind of legislation 
will demonstrate to the community that law enforcement officials have a genuine 
interest in the problem of bias crimes and a stake in vigorously pursuing the 
offenders.
