FT  04 JAN 93 / Behind the window-dressing of the January sales
THE NEW YEAR is, traditionally, a time to be upbeat about economic
prospects, as Mr John Major, the British prime minister, demonstrated last
Friday with his new year prediction that a recovery would finally arrive
sometime in 1993.
This year there is no shortage of possible reasons for optimism: Europe's
single market, America's new president, Britain's freedom to cut interest
rates, and the fact that 1993 could hardly be worse than 1992.
Stock market investors certainly seem to believe in the power of the
calendar to alter economic realities. Most of the world's main stock markets
experience a significant rally at the turn of the year, the so-called
January effect, as the chart shows. With the exception of Germany, every
country shown has a significantly higher monthly return in January than in
any other month of the year.
In the UK, for example, the FT All-Share index has risen in 23 of the 28
Januarys since 1965. Last year the FT All-Share index rose by 3.7 per cent
in January, three times the average monthly rise of 1.2 per cent in 1992, in
line with the historical January effect shown in the chart.
This January effect does not, in fact, tend to be restricted to January
itself. The US turn-of-the-year rally, like the January sales, normally
starts a week before the new year and fades after the first week. But
research by Mr Mushtaq Shah and Mr Paul Kong of Goldman Sachs shows that in
the UK, France and Italy, abnormal returns in January have tended, over the
past 20 years, to persist into February.
Timing is not the only difference between the US and European new year
rallies. The US January effect tends to be a small-company event, with
large-capitalisation stocks showing little evidence of a January bounce. But
Shah and Kong found no evidence to suggest that the same is true in Europe,
while, in the UK, the opposite is the case. The average January return on a
portfolio of large-capitalisation stocks, the FT-30 index, was 4 per cent in
the period 1980-91, compared to 2.9 per cent for the FT-500 index.
Will the US and European stock markets rally this January? That they have
tended to in the past may be sufficient to ensure that history will repeat
itself, so long as enough investors believe that the January effect exists
and feel more optimistic at the beginning of the year than towards the end.
A more rational explanation is tax-loss selling: taxable US investors tend
to sell stocks whose value has declined over the year, in December, to
realise the capital loss for tax purposes. But this cannot explain the
international evidence. Japan has a January effect even though it has no
capital gains tax, while the UK tax year ends in April.
New Year window-dressing by portfolio managers may provide a better
explanation. While fund managers are keen to hold undervalued stocks, Shah
and Kong hypothesise, they prefer to avoid poor performing stocks appearing
in their end-of-year reports. So stocks which have done badly over the year
tend to be sold in December and then repurchased in the New Year. The
evidence appears to support the window-dressing story. Among the countries
shown in the chart, the January rally tends to be larger when the market is
undervalued, that is when the average yield on bonds relative to equities is
lower than its historical average.
If the under-valuation thesis is correct, then investors can expect strong
January rallies this year in some big European markets. The ratio of bond
yields to those in equity markets is currently significantly lower in the
UK, France, Spain, Sweden and Norway than the average yield ratio over the
past 20 years.
The UK's relatively low yield ratio may suggest that any equity market
revival should persist beyond January now that sterling has left the
European exchange rate mechanism. UK share prices would have to rise by 10
per cent to restore the yield ratio to its historical average. But all
depends on whether Mr Major's predicted recovery proves to be more than
wishful new year thinking.
