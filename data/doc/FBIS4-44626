<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  Research on a GaAs 1 x 2 MZ waveguide switch/modulator is 
reported. The operating principle of the device is analyzed. The 
device employs a Y branch as a 3 dB coupler and an asymmetric X 
junction as an interferometer. At a wavelength of 1.15 m, 
the 
switch was found to have a crosstalk ratio of less than -16 dB 
and a switching voltage of 19 V. The device is expected to be 
widely used in GaAs 1 x n switching arrays and high-speed 
optical modulators. 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  In integrated optics, optical switches and light modulators 
are basic devices not only widely used in optical 
communications, optical computing and optical information 
processing systems but also are basic components in optical 
switching arrays. In recent years, significant progress has been 
made in optical switch/modulators. The speed of the 
electro-optic MZ interferometric modulator/switch has reached 
26.4 GHz.[.sup]1[/] The modulating speed of a phase modulator 
is as high as 110 GHz.[.sup]2[/] Following are the main 
electro-optic modulator/switch structures: 
  (1) a MZ switch/modulator that couples a Y branch with three 
waveguides,[.sup]3,4[/]; 
  (2) a directionally coupled modulator/switch,[.sup]5[/]; 
  (3) a BOA [bifurcated optically active] optical 
switch/modulator,[.sup]6[/]; 
  (4) an asymmetric MZ switch/modulator.[.sup]7,8[/] 
  Each structure has its own unique characteristics and has 
been widely studied and used in various applications. A Y-branch 
MZ waveguide modulator that employs two Y branch couplers as the 
input usually only can function as a modulator because there is 
only one input and one output. In reference 8, we reported a 2 x 
2 GaAs symmetric MZ switch/modulator. In this 2 x 2 switch, two 
asymmetric X junctions are used to replace the Y-branch couple 
in a Y-branch modulator to form a 2 x 2 switch. Since the two 
modulating waveguides in this switch have different widths, a 
propagation constant difference usually exists. In a pulse input 
mode, pulses are often lost. Therefore, such a device cannot 
operate in a pulse mode. For the first time, a 1 x 2 GaAs MZ 
waveguide switch/modulator is reported. An asymmetric X junction 
is used to replace the interferometer in a Y-branch modulator. 
The device not only has an excellent 3 dB light splitting effect 
as a Y-branch coupler but also has the characteristics of a 1 x 
2 switch. Furthermore, its modulating waveguide is symmetrical, 
solving the problem of a 2 x 2 symmetric MZ switch operating in 
the pulse mode. It makes the Y-branch MZ waveguide modulator 
more useful over a wide range of applications. 
<H5>  2. Basic Principle </H5>
  Figure 1 shows the structure of a single-mode, Y-branch 
modulator. When a polarized beam of light enters from the input 
end of the modulator, it is split into two identical beams by 
the Y-branch coupler. These two beams of identical power pass 
through two electro-optically active regions to determine their 
phase difference. In addition, interference takes place in 
another Y-branch coupler. The basic mode produced is sent out 
via the waveguide. The first-order mode produced is cutoff in 
the single-mode output waveguide and is scattered to the 
substrate or the flat waveguide. The principle of the asymmetric 
X-junction is discussed in reference 9. When the X-junction 
branching angle _th_ &lt; _D__b_/_g_, the asymmetric 
X-junction 
plays a mode-separation role. Figure 2 shows the basic principle 
of the X-junction as an interferometer. When two identically 
polarized beams come in from its symmetric input ends, they 
superpose each other in the interference region and even modes 
are produced to exit from the wide waveguide (as shown in Figure 
2(b)). When two beams of opposite polarization enter from the 
symmetric input ends, odd modes are produced in the interference 
region and exit from the narrow waveguide (as shown in Figure 
2(c)).

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-15B>      Figure 2. Principle of Using an X-Junction as an Interferometer </FIG>


  On the basis of the above analysis, this X-junction MZ 
modulator not only preserves the advantages of a MZ modulator, 
such as high-speed modulation, but also can work as a 1 x 2 
switching element to form a switching array. Figure 3 shows the 
operating principle of the switch. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-15C>      Figure 3. Principle of the 1 x 2 Switch </FIG>


  A polarized beam is split into two beams of identical power 
by the Y-branch 3 dB coupler. After passing through the 
electro-optic modulating region, the relative phase difference 
is obtained. Furthermore, as a result of interference in the 
asymmetric X-junction, even modes will exit from the wide 
waveguide and odd modes from the narrow waveguide, i.e., 
  P[.sub]out1[/] = 
P[.sub]in[/]cos[.sup]2[/](_Ph_/2), (1a) 
  P[.sub]out2[/] = 
P[.sub]in[/]sin[.sup]2[/](_D__Ph_/2), (1b) 
  _D__Ph_ = _D__Ph_[.sub]e[/] + 
_D__Ph_[.sub]0[/], (1c) 
  where _D__Ph_[.sub]0[/] is the initial phase difference and 
_D__Ph_[.sub]e[/] is the relative phase difference caused by 
electro-optic effect. 
  In equation (1) only _D__Ph_[.sub]e[/] is a function of 
applied voltage V, i.e., 
  _D__Ph_[.sub]e[/] = 
(/_l_)r[.sub]41[/]n[.sup]3[/]L&Ggr;V/d, (2) 
  where L is the length of the electrode, d is the waveguide 
thickness, &Ggr; represents an overlapping integral, n is the 
index of refraction and r[.sub]41[/] is the electro-optic 
coefficient. 
<H5>  3. High-Speed Switching Characteristics </H5>
  The high-speed switching characteristics of electro-optic 
modulators are limited in two areas. 
  The modulation bandwidth of lumped-electrode devices is: 
  _D_f[.sub]0[/] [congruent] 1/(2R[.sub]s[/]CL), (3) 
  where C is the junction capacitance per unit length, L is 
the 
length of the electrode and R[.sub]s[/] is the matching 
resistance. 
  From the above equation we know that modulation bandwidth is 
limited by junction capacitance. Reducing junction capacitance 
is the primary way to raise the switching speed of a 
lumped-electrode device. 
  For a traveling wave device, the modulating speed is limited 
by the mismatch between electric and optical field. The 
modulation bandwidth is: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-15D>      Equation </FIG>

  _D_f[.sub]e[/] = 
1.4c/L(n[.sub]0[/]-n[.sub]u[/] (4) 
  where n[.sub]0[/] and n[.sub]u[/] are the optic and 
microwave refractance, respectively, and L is the length of the 
interaction region. 
  To date, the bandwidth of a lumped-electrode 3 dB MZ 
modulator is as wide as 8.4 GHz and that of a traveling wave 3 
dB MZ modulator is as wide as 24.6 GHz. 
<H5>  4. Crosstalk Analysis </H5>
  In an asymmetric 1 x 2 MZ switch, crosstalk comes from two 
sources. One is due to asymmetry of the two branch waveguides of 
the Y-branch 3 dB coupler resulting in two beams of unequal 
power. 
  Assume the beam power levels are I[.sub]1[/] and 
I[.sub]2[/] and a relative phase delay of _D__Ph_/2 is 
obtained after passage through the interference region. Then, 
the crosstalk is: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-16A>      Equation </FIG>


  The other cause is due to a large branching angle of the 
X-junction, which results in incomplete mode separation to 
produce crosstalk. In reference 9, the authors calculated 
mode-separation amplitude ratios at various angles. 
<H5>  5. Design and Fabrication of the Device </H5>
  The dimension of the single-mode waveguide is calculated 
using the effective refractance method and the X-junction angle 
is derived from equation (2). Figure 4 shows the device 
parameters. The device is fabricated on a 
n[.sup]-[/]/n[.sup]+[/]GaAs epitaxial wafer which is 
prepared by means of vapor-phase epitaxy. The device is made by 
etching. The waveguide is chemically etched in 
H[.sub]3[/]PO[.sub]4[/]:H[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]2[/]:H[.sub]2[/]O 
= 1:1:10 at 25C for 2 minutes and 30 seconds to produce a 
1.2-m ridge. Figure 5(a) shows the parameters of the ridge 
waveguide. A lumped-electrode modulation mode was chosen. The 
upper electrode is an Al-Schottky barrier contact and the lower 
electrode is an Au-Ge-Ni ohmic contact. The electrode parameters 
are shown in Figure 5(b).

<H5>  6. Testing and Results </H5>
  A beam of polarized light enters the waveguide after passing 
through a lens. The light that exits the waveguide is collimated 
again by a lens to be captured by an infrared camera. The light 
spot is displayed on a monitor and the optical field 
distribution is recorded in memory. Figure 6 [photograph not 
reproduced] shows the distribution of light spot and optical 
field at different voltages. If the switching voltage is defined 
as the amount of applied voltage required to change the output 
optical power from maximum to minimum or vice versa, then at 
_l_ 
= 1.15 m it was found that the switching voltage is 19 V and 
crosstalk ratio is -16 dB. Figure 7 shows the variation of 
optical power at the two outputs as a function of modulation 
voltage. The modulating electrode is a lumped electrode. At zero 
bias voltage, the electrode capacitance was measured to be 
approximately 4 pF. If the matching resistor is 50 _O_, then 
the 
bandwidth of the device is expected to be greater than 1.8 GHz. 
The transmission loss of the waveguide is determined by 
measuring its attenuation coefficient,[.sup]10[/] i.e., 
measuring the output power of the waveguide at different 
wavelengths with identical input optical power and then 
determining transmission loss according to the following 
equation: 
  _a_ = ln (I[.sub]1[/]/I[.sub]2[/])/(Z[.sub]2[/] - 
Z[.sub]1[/], 
  transmission loss = 4.3 _a_ (dB/cm), 
  where Z[.sub]i[/] is the waveguide length (i = 1, 2...) 
and I[.sub]i[/] is the light intensity. By measuring a large 
number of specimens, transmission loss can be accurately 
determined. With waveguide parameters described above, 
transmission loss was measured to be approximately 7 dB/cm. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-011-17A>      Figure 7. Output Power vs. Modulating Voltage </FIG>


<H5>  7. Discussion </H5>
  From Figure 7, the light output power ratio of the two 
output 
waveguides is about 4:1. This indicates that there is a relative 
phase difference between the two polarized light beams passing 
through those two waveguides. It also means that the two 
parallel waveguides have different propagation constants. Under 
circumstances wherein the waveguides are intact, this suggests 
that the two waveguides are not exactly symmetric. This minute 
asymmetry is primarily introduced in the fabrication process. As 
far as the Y-branch coupler is concerned, a minute asymmetry 
will seriously affect the beam-splitting ratio. We have already 
discussed the crosstalk ratio due to uneven beam splitting. 
  In addition, the waveguide used is a 
n[.sup]-[/]/n[.sup]+[/] homojunction waveguide. This 
structure does not limit the optical field much. A large amount 
of optical field is distributed in the low-resistance substrate. 
This not only increases the transmission loss but also reduces 
the overlapping integral between the optical field and electric 
field (&Ggr;) and causes the half-wave voltage to rise. An 
effective way to solve this problem is to use a GaAs/GaAlAs 
heterojunction. The difference in index of refraction between 
the GaAlAs limiting layer and the GaAs waveguide is relatively 
large (approximately 10[.sup]-2[/]) and the optical field can 
be effectively confined within the waveguide. Therefore, 
absorptive loss in the substrate and metal electrode can be 
reduced and the overlapping integral can be increased. Moreover, 
the waveguide of this type of structure is thinner (&lt; 1 
m) 
and the half-wave voltage is also drastically lower. Presently, 
transmission loss of a GaAs heterojunction is less than 0.2 
dB/cm,[.sup]11[/] and the half-wave voltage of such an 
electro-optic modulator is less than 5 V.[.sup]1[/] 
<H5>  8. Conclusion </H5>
  A 1 x 2 GaAs asymmetric MZ waveguide switch/modulator using 
a 
Y-branch coupler and an asymmetric X-junction is presented. A 
switching voltage of 19 V and a crosstalk ratio of -16 dB have 
been achieved. The device can be used as a switching element in 
a 1 x n switching array and as a high-speed modulator.
