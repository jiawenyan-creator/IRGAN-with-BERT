FT  27 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts rally sharply following surprise
base rate cut
UK GOVERNMENT bond prices rallied strongly in the wake of yesterday's
surprise cut in base rates. Dealers said they had been expecting a cut
before the Budget on March 16, but yesterday's move had beaten their
expectations by a few weeks.
Dealers said another base rate cut was possible before the Budget.
The sharp price rise sparked by the rate cut caused a scramble among the
market-makers who rushed to cover the short positions which they had taken
out ahead of today's gilt auction. However, traders said the Pounds 2.5bn
auction of 8 1/2 per cent Treasury stock due 2007 should still proceed
smoothly.
The prospect of a large supply of long-dated paper coming to the market held
the gain at the longer end to just under a point, while the shorter end rose
over a point, causing the yield curve to steepen further.
The Liffe March gilt future ended at 101.02, up one point on the day but off
the day's high of 101.23. Volume in the futures market was high at 60,650
lots.
ITALIAN government bond prices jumped over half a point following the UK
base rate cut, which raised hopes of an imminent cut of at least half a
point in Italy's discount rate.
These hopes were further fanned by data from the city of Bologna, which
showed Italian inflation fell to 4.3 to 4.4 per cent year-on-year in January
from 4.8 per cent in December, and by a fall in yields on three-month paper
and in average rates at the Bank of Italy's repo.
Dealers said buying interest in Italian government bonds was gaining
momentum, because Italy's interest rates had fallen far slower than the UK's
since last September when both countries' currencies left the European
exchange rate mechanism. Italy's discount rate currently stands at 12 per
cent.
The Liffe March Italian contract rose 0.56 point to 95.82, on volume of
15,333 contracts, off the day's high of 96.02, while the benchmark 12 per
cent bond due 2002 rose 0.61 point to 95.87.
GERMAN government bond prices were hit late in the day by a warning from the
Bundesbank president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, that an increase in
inflationary trends would rule out a cut in interest rates, particularly
when those trends could be prevented.
The Liffe March bund contract came off the day's high of 92.97 to end at
92.71, up 3 basis points on the day in above-average volume of 73,889 lots.
Earlier in the day, DM3bn worth of 10-year bonds from the Treuhand
privatisation agency was sold via a consortium of both German and foreign
banks. The paper carries a 7 1/8 per cent coupon and a launch price of
100.50 to yield 7.05 per cent. In late grey market trade, it was quoted at
99.74/80.
A second amount will be auctioned today and a third amount will be allocated
to the central bank for market intervention. Dealers expect the bond to
total DM8bn.
PROFIT-taking following Monday's big rally, strong economic figures and weak
demand for the two-year issue, left longer-dated US Treasury securities
lower yesterday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  23/32 at
104 1/2 , yielding 7.248 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 19/32 , to yield 4.282 per cent.
Supply pressures exerted their influence on the market early yesterday, with
dealers marking down prices ahead of the afternoon auction by the Treasury
of Dollars 15.25bn in two-year notes.
Prices tumbled further after the sale, which was completed at a yield of
4.28 per cent, higher than expected because of unexpectedly poor demand for
the two-year notes.
