THE BLACK EXPERIENCE IN HOLLYWOOD 
In Goldstein's April 17 article, "The Hollywood Shuffle," Spike Lee is quoted 
thusly: "Lots of people -- even black people -- thank Cleopatra was a white 
woman just 'cause Elizabeth Taylor played her in the movie." 
Actually, lots of people think Cleopatra was white 'cause she was! 
The last of the Ptolemy rulers of Egypt, Cleopatra was descended from the Greek 
general of the same name, one of the men who helped Alexander the Great conquer 
the known world. 
When Alexander died, his generals divided up his territories and Ptolemy chose 
Egypt. He and all his descendants (including Cleopatra) married Greeks -- quite 
often their sisters or aunts or, in Cleo's case, brothers. 
Thus, in spite of ruling Egypt for centuries, the Ptolemys remained almost pure 
Greek -- with just a touch of Iranian (Aryan) blood and no African blood at 
all. 
In the film to which Mr. Lee refers, Marc Antony (Richard Burton) responds to a 
question from Cleopatra (Elizabeth Taylor) as to what he prefers in life by 
saying " . . . and most things Greek." To which Cleo replies that they should 
get along together well since she was a "mostly Greek thing."
