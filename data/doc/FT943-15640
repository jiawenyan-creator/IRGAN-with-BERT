FT  08 JUL 94 / Woolwich overdraft rate cut by half
The battle for current account customers intensified yesterday when
Woolwich, the third largest building society, said it would slash its annual
percentage rate on authorised overdrafts to 9.8 per cent from 19 per cent
with immediate effect.
The move comes a week after Abbey National reduced its annual percentage
rate (APR) on authorised overdrafts from 18.4 per cent to 9.9 per cent and
two days after Midland Bank promised to pay customers Pounds 10 for each
failure to meet set standards of service in transferring a current account.
Mr Peter Robinson, managing director of Woolwich, said the rate had been cut
to maintain its competitive stance and was 'a further indication of the
favourable effect that building societies are having in reducing the costs
of banking services'.
Woolwich, which introduced its current account four years ago, also reduced
its unauthorised overdraft rate to an APR of 29.5 per cent from 31 per cent.
The building society has just 375,000 of the estimated 33m current accounts
in the UK. It said its current accounts had recently become profitable,
allowing it to offer the reduced overdraft rate. Abbey National has 1.5m
current account customers.
Most banks said yesterday that they had no plans to react but would watch
developments. Barclays Bank, which has 7m current account customers,
described the Woolwich cut as 'a classic move by a niche player trying to
get a bigger slice of the cake'.
Halifax, the largest building society, with 750,000 current account holders,
said it did not intend to make changes to its overdraft rates, particularly
since it cut its authorised overdraft APR from 14.9 per cent to 12.4 per
cent last month.
