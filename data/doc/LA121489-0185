BRIEFLY 
AT&amp;T Wants to Use Soviet Satellite: American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. 
proposed increasing telecommunications circuits between the United States and 
the Soviet Union by using the Soviet Intersputnik satellite system. Telephone 
traffic between the two countries rose more than 140% in the past two years in 
part because of improvements in the telecommunications network, the New 
York-based company said. But demand still far exceeds existing capacity, it 
added. AT&amp;T said its proposal, which would require approval by the Federal 
Communications Commission, could triple telecommunications capacity between the 
two nations.
