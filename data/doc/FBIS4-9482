  [Text] Bratislava April 25 (CTK) -- The government 
Coalition Council must discuss soon Premier Jozef Moravcik's 
election chairman of the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS) 
which is at variance with the principle that the leader of a 
coalition party cannot be a government member, Peter Weiss said 
today. 
  Asked whether Moravcik's election was in breach of the 
coalition agreement, Weiss, chairman of the coalition Democratic 
Left Party (SDL), said the agreement did not suppose the 
cumulation of political and government posts. 
  DEUS was formed on Saturday by a merger between the 
Alternative of Political Realism (APR) and the Alliance of 
Democrats of Slovakia (AD). 
  Moravcik said on his election that in compliance with the 
DEUS statutes, during his premiership he would be represented as 
DEUS leader by First Deputy Chairman Milan Knazko.
