FT  27 FEB 92 / Industry output falls 0.8%
JAPAN'S industrial production for January fell 0.8 per cent from December,
allaying fears it had fallen sharply during the month, but signifying the
fourth consecutive month of year-on-year decline.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) said the
seasonally-adjusted production index stood at 124.8, against a base of 100
for 1985, while the shipment index gained 1 per cent from December to 127.6
and the inventory index stayed flat at 124.5.
The fall in output was less than expected, but Miti said the decline was
likely to continue over the next few months, with a 0.7 per cent decrease
predicted for February and a 1.3 per cent fall for March.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, said the economy was 'not
contracting quickly' and the bank was more concerned about price stability
than falling industrial output. Japanese politicians have urged the central
bank to cut the official discount rate from its present 4.5 per cent. But Mr
Mieno said monetary policy should not be altered to respond to short-term
economic indicators. Prices were stable, but upward price pressure could
return quickly.
