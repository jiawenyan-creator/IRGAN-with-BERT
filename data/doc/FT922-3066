FT  13 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Spices
The pepper market's weakness of the past few weeks continues, reports
Man-producten, making buyers extremely reluctant to enter into fresh
commitments in spite of very low price levels. Selling pressure from Vietnam
has diminished to some extent, but new pressure is emerging from Malaysia
(black pepper) and Indonesia (white) where the new crops, though lower than
last year, are to be harvested soon. White pepper for prompt shipment is
offered at Dollars 1,150 a tonne cif and grade 1 black pepper at Dollars 950
cif.
