FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Digital set back by Dollars
1.5bn charge
DIGITAL Equipment, the US computer manufacturer, has revealed a
fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 1.85bn, including restructuring charges of
Dollars 1.5bn to cover the cost of job cuts and plant closures.
The heavy losses reflect the severity of Digital's problems as it struggles
to come to terms with technology shifts and an industry slowdown. The
results come in the wake of last week's announcement that Mr Kenneth Olsen,
the company's founder and president, will retire on October 1 amid criticism
that he has not moved fast enough to improve Digital's performance.
Mr Olsen said yesterday that Digital was 'taking actions designed to
increase revenues, increase market share, reduce costs and improve our
efficiency'.
For the fourth quarter, Digital recorded an operating loss of Dollars 188m.
Net losses equalled Dollars 14.76 a share, including the restructuring
charge. In the same period last year, when Digital also took charges for
consolidation, the company recorded losses of Dollars 871.3m, or Dollars
7.08 a share. Revenues for the quarter were virtually flat.
Losses for the full fiscal year came to Dollars 2.8bn, against a loss of
Dollars 617m last year, when the company recorded its first- ever annual
loss.
In addition to restructuring charges, 1992 losses include a charge of
Dollars 485m, applied retroactively to the first quarter, for accounting
changes relating to pensioners' benefits.
On a per share basis, the net loss for the year was Dollars 22.39, compared
with a loss of Dollars 5.08 last year.
Revenues for the year were essentially flat at Dollars 13.93bn, against
Dollars 13.91bn last year.
