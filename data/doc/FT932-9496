FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Midwest SE returns to its
Chicago roots
THE Midwest stock exchange, the second-largest stock exchange in the US
after New York, will return to its original name, the Chicago Stock
Exchange, from July 8. Members voted for the change in the hope that the
Chicago name would carry a higher profile than 'Midwest'.
The 111-year-old stock exchange took the Midwest name in 1949 when it
acquired stock exchanges in Cleveland, St Louis, Minneapolis and, later, New
Orleans.
'We operate in a very competitive environment and want to build the identity
of our exchange locally, nationally and internationally,' said Mr Homer
Livingston, exchange president. 'We believe the name 'Chicago' is key to
strengthening that identity, given the Chicago exchange's reputation for
creative products, innovative technology and focus on service.'
