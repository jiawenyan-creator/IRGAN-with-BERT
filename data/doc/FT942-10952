FT  07 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Exercising an option
As a member of an approved share option scheme, I will be exercising an
option later this year. As I have already exercised one in the past three
years, any difference between issue price and market value will be taxable.
The option is with my employer's ultimate holding company, a PLC.
1. On what basis will the market value be established?
2. (a) How will the exercise be taxed? (b) If treated as capital gains tax,
can the annual exemption be applied? (c) If treated as a taxable benefit,
should it be included on my P11d from my employing company? (d) Will I be
able to include the taxable benefit with my earnings, in order to calculate
my 15 per cent maximum FSAVC contribution?
Ask your tax office for the explanatory pamphlet on share option schemes,
IR100. Briefly, the answers to your questions are:
1. By reference to the prices quoted in the Stock Exchange Daily List.
2. (a) As income. (b) Does not arise. (c) No, because it has to be reported
specifically. (d) Yes.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
