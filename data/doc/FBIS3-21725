  [Text] Francisco Galan, Army of National Liberation, ELN, 
leader, was transferred to Itagui maximum security prison in the 
last few hours. A petition for protection recognized the 
guerrilla's right not to remain in solitary confinement. There 
was intense activity at Itagui prison since early today. The 
unexpected transfer of Galan and Juan Fernando Ospina Montoya, 
alias El Gordo, a Medellin Cartel member, was carried out 
without a great fuss. 
  Galan was transferred from Santa Fe de Bogota aboard a 
National Police airplane after a judge ruled in his favor when a 
petition was filed requesting he be removed from the military 
garrison where he was being held and sent to a prison. 
  Ospina Montoya was flown from Medellin to the capital aboard 
the same plane. He is to testify before a faceless judge, who is 
in charge of his case, in the next few hours. Ospina Montoya 
surrendered to justice on 4 July 1991 together with La Garra, El 
Angelito, and Icopur. He was one of the few who was unable to 
escape Envigado prison.
