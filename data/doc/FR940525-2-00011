ACTION:

 Notice of inquiry.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy seeks to address the concerns of affected parties regarding the continued storage of spent
nuclear fuel at reactor sites beyond 1998. Through this Notice of Inquiry, the Department desires to elicit the views
of affected parties on: (1) The Department's preliminary view that it does not have a statutory obligation to accept
spent nuclear fuel in 1998 in the absence of an operational repository or a suitable storage facility constructed
under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended; (2) the need for an interim, away-from-reactor storage facility
prior to repository operations; and (3) options for offsetting, through the use of the Nuclear Waste Fund, a portion
of the financial burden that may be incurred by utilities in continuing to store spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites
beyond 1998. While seeking these comments, the Department remains committed to pursuing the permanent disposal
of spent nuclear fuel and developing a strategy to address its interim storage.

I. Background 



A. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 



The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, [Act], 42 U.S.C. 10101 

et seq

., provides a comprehensive framework for disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive
waste. Section 302 of the Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund and required owners and generators of spent nuclear
fuel and high-level waste to pay fees into the Nuclear Waste Fund sufficient to ensure the full-cost recovery of all
program expenditures. Section 302(a) authorized the Secretary to enter into contracts with the owners and generators
of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste of domestic origin [herein referred to as ``utility''] for the acceptance
and disposal of such wastes. Section 302(a)(5) of the Act further stipulated that these contracts shall provide that
the Secretary shall take title to the spent nuclear fuel or high-level waste as expeditiously as practicable following
commencement of operation of a repository and that, in return for payment of the fees established by this section,
the Secretary, beginning not later than January 31, 1998, will dispose of these wastes. 



B. Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste 



The Department implemented Section 302(a) of the Act through rulemaking under which it promulgated the Standard
Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste (Standard Contract) (48 FR 16590,
codified at 10 CFR part 961), which was published on April 18, 1983. Article II of the Standard Contract states that
``the services to be provided by DOE [Department of Energy] under this contract shall begin, after commencement of
facility operations, not later than January 31, 1998 ***''. The use of the term ``facility'' in the
Standard Contract, as contrasted with the use of the term ``repository'' in the Act, was in recognition that a Monitored
Retrievable Storage (MRS) facility may be available before a repository and could meet the intent of the statute.
