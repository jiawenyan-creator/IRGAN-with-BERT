A coalition of conservation groups urged the Bush Administration to spend $781 
million next year to buy land that might otherwise be lost to developers in and 
around national preserves in 46 states. The money would come from the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, which is largely funded with money from oil-drilling 
on the federally owned outer continental shelf, the coalition said. The 
purchase of land under the fund fell under former President Ronald Reagan, from 
$509 million in 1980 to $206 million this year. President Bush has recommended 
keeping spending at $206 million for the next fiscal year. Among the 
recommendations is the purchase of 5,000 acres in Zuma, Trancas and Corral 
canyons and elsewhere in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area 
for $30 million.
