FT  06 NOV 92 / Jailing of editor sought over Arrow jury article
TWO High Court judges were asked yesterday to punish the Mail on Sunday for
a 'self-evident' contempt of court in publishing an article in July
disclosing details of the secret deliberations of the Blue Arrow fraud trial
jury.
Mr Philip Havers, appearing for Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, attorney-general, is
seeking a fine against Associated Newspapers, the publisher, and the
imprisonment of Mr Stewart Steven, who was then editor, and of Mr Clive
Wolman, City editor.
Mr Havers said the 1981 Contempt of Court Act stated it was a contempt 'to
obtain, disclose or solicit any particulars' of jury deliberations. Section
8(1) of the act imposed a strict liability in respect of obtaining such
information and there was no restriction upon those to whom the act applied.
Mr Havers said the newspaper's defence relied on article 10 of the European
Convention on Human Rights, which guaranteed the right to freedom of
expression on matters of public importance.
Mr Havers said that on February 14 the Blue Arrow jury convicted four of the
10 original defendants and acquitted one. The other five had already been
acquitted on the direction of the judge.
In July, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeals by the four convicted
defendants.
Mr David Pannick QC, for Associated Newspapers, said the case raised
important legal questions about the scope of freedom of expression in the
context - which was of considerable public importance - of whether serious
fraud trials should be conducted before a jury.
There was no evidence to show that the newspaper had obtained the published
information directly from any jury member. All the evidence was that the
information was provided by jury members to US researchers who then provided
that information to Mr Wolman.
The hearing was adjourned until today.
