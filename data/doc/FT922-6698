FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank slows
DEUTSCHE Bank, Germany's largest bank, yesterday said its profits growth had
slowed this year and Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive, indicated that there
was little chance of a further dividend rise.
Operating profits in the group grew by 10 per cent in the first four months
and by 4 per cent at the parent bank. The comparison is with one third of
last year's total profit. Commerzbank recently reported a 70 per cent jump
in the first two months, although the rise was 25 per cent if compared with
one sixth of last year's full result.
Mr Kopper said that the credit situation was worsening in parts of the
German economy and it was thus too early to forecast a rise in the dividend.
Last year, the bank raised operating profits by 16.5 per cent to nearly
DM6bn (Dollars 3.6bn) and is lifting the 1991 distribution by DM1 to DM15 a
share.
