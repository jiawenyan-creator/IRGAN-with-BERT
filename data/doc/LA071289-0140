NAMES IN THE NEWS; 
PAPANDREOU, LIANI TO WED THURSDAY 
Defeated Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, 70, plans to marry his 
mistress, 34-year-old airline hostess Dimitra Liani, Thursday but a series of 
political scandals will block any honeymoon plans. 
The socialist politician, whose three-year affair caused constant headlines, is 
a target of criminal investigation into multimillion-dollar scandals that 
helped cause his crushing electoral defeat in June. 
The low-key marriage has been hailed by Greek newspapers as a major social 
event, comparable to the 1968 wedding of Jacqueline Kennedy to shipping magnate 
Aristotle Onassis. Newspapers say Papandreou, who could face prosecution in 
scandals that include embezzlement from a major bank, will wed Liani in a small 
church near their luxury villa in the Athens suburb of Ekali. None of 
Papandreou's four children from his marriage to American Margaret Chant are 
expected to attend.
