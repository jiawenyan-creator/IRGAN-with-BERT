FT  08 SEP 92 / Mexican textile and oil disputes resolved
TWO of Mexico's longest and most bitter labour disputes have been resolved,
with the bulk of 22,000 striking textile workers returning to work yesterday
and another 15,000 former oil workers ending their civic protests in return
for compensation from the state oil company, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico
City.
A few thousand of the former oil workers had occupied Mexico's central
square for 39 days, bringing further chaos to Mexico's congested historical
centre. The workers were protesting against their dismissal and demanding
severance pay.
The oil workers were joined by fishermen and farmers demanding compensation
for the pollution caused by Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), Mexico's state oil
company, to their lands and fishing waters.
Under the agreement Pemex has agreed to compensate 'temporary' workers who
had been with the company before 1990 and consider the demands of others,
including those of the fishermen.
On Friday the textile workers agreed to a 14 per cent wage increase and some
modifications in work rules, ending a 59-day strike. The textile owners had
originally offered a 10 per cent wage increase, while the workers had
initially demanded 50 per cent and then 15 per cent. About 30 per cent of
the textile mill owners refused to sign the agreement.
During the strike about 60 mills filed for bankruptcy, according to the
national textile chamber, and another 50 may file soon.
