FT  02 JAN 93 / UK Company News: St Andrew directors say no to EIO
The independent directors on the board of St Andrew Trust, the smaller
companies investment trust, have said that the offer from the Ecclesiastical
Insurance Office 'merits careful consideration' but are not recommending
acceptance.
The offer is a technical one being made to comply with new European
Community regulations; EIO, which currently has a 40.3 per cent stake in St
Andrew, needs to have a majority holding in the trust for capital adequacy
purposes. However, it does not wish to acquire more than a 75 per cent
stake, and thereby lose St Andrew's investment trust status.
