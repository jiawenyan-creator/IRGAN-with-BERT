FT  07 MAY 92 / Clinton closes in on party nomination
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas notched up his biggest victory margins of
the electoral season in three primaries on Tuesday, and is now within sight
of a first-ballot nomination to be the Democratic party's presidential
candidate.
He won 74 per cent of the vote in the District of Columbia, 64 per cent in
North Carolina and 63 per cent in Indiana, picking up 144 of the 178
convention delegates allocated on Tuesday. He now has about 1,740 delegates
of the 2,145 needed for the nomination, with about 1,100 still to be
selected.
In DC and North Carolina, Mr Jerry Brown, his only active challenger, failed
to pass the 15 per cent vote threshold and won no delegates. He conceded the
numbers were running heavily in Mr Clinton's favour but promised to take his
cause to the final primaries, including his native California, on June 2.
For President George Bush, already mathematically assured of the Republican
nomination, the biggest satisfaction was his 71-20 per cent margin of
victory in North Carolina over Mr Patrick Buchanan, who put in two weeks of
solid campaigning in the state.
Mr Ross Perot, the prospective independent candidate who is on no primary
ballot, appeared to attract the support of about 25 per cent of those
interviewed in Indiana and North Carolina.
