  [Text] Moscow, 13 May -- Russia and the DPRK favor boosting 
bilateral links, including political contacts, Aleksandr Panov, 
Russian Federation deputy foreign minister, told ITAR-TASS 
today, after the end of political consultations at the level of 
deputy heads of foreign departments of Russia and the DPRK. The 
North Korean side advocated, inter alia, Russia's participation 
in the Rajin-Sonbong free economic zone, as well as cooperation 
in Siberia and in the Russian Far East. Both sides stated both 
countries' economic potential should be put to better use. 
  Moscow and Pyongyang said a new agreement on the 
participation of the North Korean side in logging in the Russian 
east should be signed as soon as possible. North Korean workers 
staying on the Russian territory should abide by the Russian 
law. Both sides acknowledge the need for creating better living 
conditions for them, said the Russian deputy foreign minister. 
  The consultations between Aleksandr Panov and his North 
Korean counterpart Yi In-Kui took place in Moscow on Thursday
