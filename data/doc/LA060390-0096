GAMBLING INITIATIVE DRIVE BEGINS 
Backers of a referendum to create a legalized gambling club in West Hollywood 
have begun collecting signatures for a petition that would require the City 
Council to put a gambling initiative on the November ballot. 
The council last December unanimously rejected a request for a referendum that 
would have allowed gambling on all legal card games at Cavendish West 
Hollywood, a private bridge and rummy club at 9255 W. Sunset Boulevard. 
To qualify for the November ballot, the group needs the support of 15% of the 
city's 20,000 registered voters -- roughly 3,000 signatures -- on a petition by 
June 12. 
"I'm confident we will be able to get the signatures we need to qualify the 
measure," said Bruce Decker, a spokesman for the West Hollywood Club Initiative 
Committee. "We have contracted with a professional signature-gathering firm and 
we plan to do a signature-gathering blitz over the weekend and through 
(Tuesday's) election." 
Proponents claim that the club could generate from $5 million to $10 million 
annually for the city, roughly 10% of the club's estimated gross revenues. 
To make the issue more appealing to the voters, Decker said, the initiative 
requires the city to earmark three-fourths of its revenues for the elderly, 
increased law enforcement, gay and lesbian services, and the revitalization of 
the city's east end, where the club is to be located. The city would be allowed 
to use the remaining one-fourth at its own discretion.
