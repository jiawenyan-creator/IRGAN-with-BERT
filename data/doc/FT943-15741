FT  07 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Keys resignation adds to S Africa woes
Johannesburg could find little positive news to support prices but limited
selling kept losses to a minimum. Tuesday's resignation of Mr Derek Keys as
finance minister had caught the market unawares; however, the swift
announcement of a replacement steadied nerves and took the sting out of
losses.
In addition, a slightly softer bullion price and continued concern about the
outlook for world markets depressed sentiment, limiting demand until further
concrete factors emerge.
The overall index finished 47 lower at 5,404, industrials lost 47 at 6,220
and golds declined 52 to 2,121. Anglo American relinquished R3 to R225 and
De Beers was R1.25 lower at R106.50. Richemont shed R1 to R37.50.
Key industry stocks were firmer, SAB appreciating R1 to R88 and Gencor
climbing 15 cents to R10.90. However, Iscor dipped 8 cents to R3.42, Barlows
receded 75 cents to R34.50 and Remgro eased 25 cents to R25. Banks were also
soft, Firstbank losing 25 cents at R21.50.
