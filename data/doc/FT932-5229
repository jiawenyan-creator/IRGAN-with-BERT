FT  04 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
Encouraged by the new-found strength of copper prices (see story above) the
London Metal Exchange ZINC market yesterday made a further attempt to erode
resistance above Dollars 950 a tonne for three months metal. But dealers
said it ran out of momentum at Dollars 957 before closing Dollars 6 up on
the day at Dollars 955.50 a tonne. 'If copper falls back I can't see zinc at
these levels for long,' one trader said. LEAD prices recovered some more of
their losses as recognition that recent production cuts had limited the
downside for the metal sparked a bout of short-covering. The three months
delivery price closed at Pounds 271.25 a tonne, up Pounds 3.75. The NICKEL
market was also firmer, with the three months price breaking resistance
above Dollars 5,700 to close at Dollars 5,826.50 a tonne, up Dollars 121 on
the day. In after-hours trading, however, it slipped back to Dollars 5,805.
In the GOLD market this week's retracement from recent highs was halted by
persistent buying, believed to emanate from continental Europe. The London
price closed at Dollars 373.25 a troy ounce, up Dollars 3. PLATINUM relied
on spill-over buying from gold as it rose Dollars 5.75 to Dollars 387.5 an
ounce at the afternoon price fixing.
