FT  19 OCT 93 / Company share rules may be eased
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is proposing to relax regulations on
companies giving financial assistance for the purchase of their own shares,
according to a consultative document released yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
Companies would be allowed to provide financial assistance given in good
faith if the main reason was to achieve an objective judged to be in the
interests of the company. They would also be allowed to offer assistance if
it did not result in a significant reduction in the net assets of the
company.
It proposes relaxing procedures for shareholder approval, extending the time
period within which financial assistance can be given, and amendments to the
directors' statement and auditors' report.
The changes would be to sections 151 to 154 of the 1985 Companies Act, which
was designed to protect creditors and minority shareholders from the abuse
of companies' capital assets.
Responses should be received by the DTI by January 14 next year.
