 

The Secretary of the Interior approved the Missouri AMLR Plan on January 29, 1982. Information pertinent to the general
background of the Missouri AMLR Plan submission, as well as the Secretary's findings and the disposition of comments
can be found in the January 29, 1982, 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 4253). Subsequent actions concerning Missouri's AMLR Plan and Plan amendments can be found at 30 CFR 925.25.

The Secretary adopted regulations at 30 CFR Part 884 that specify the content requirements of a State reclamation
plan and the criteria for plan approval. The regulations provide that a State may submit to the Director proposed amendments
or revisions to the approved reclamation plan. If the amendments or revisions change the scope of major policies followed
by the State in the conduct of its reclamation program, the Director must follow the procedures set out in 30 CFR 884.14
in approving and disapproving an amendment or revision.



II. Proposed Amendment



By letter dated November 29, 1994, (Administrative Record No. AMLMO89) Missouri submitted a proposed
amendment to its AML Plan pursuant to SMCRA. Missouri submitted the proposed amendment in response to a letter from
OSM dated September 26, 1994 (Administrative Record No. AMLMO88), in accordance with 30 CFR 884.15(b)
concerning revisions to the AML regulations at 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter R (59 FR 28136, May 31, 1994).

Missouri proposes to amend its statutes at RSMo Section 444.810, Powers of Commission-abandoned mine reclamation
fund created, purpose as well as RSMo Section 444.915, Abandoned mine reclamation fund-deposits and expenditures.
Missouri proposes to amend its regulations at 10 CSR 409.020 (1) and (3), Reclamation-General Requirements.
Missouri proposes to amend its AML Plan at Section 884.13(c)(2), project ranking and selection procedures and Section
884.13(d)(3), purchasing and procurement.



(1) 10 CSR 409.020(1) (D) and (E) and (3) General Requirements



The addition of subsections (D) and (E) make additional lands eligible for reclamation activities where the coal
mining site was left: (1) either unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed between August 4, 1977, and November 21, 1980,
where funds or other financial guarantees are not sufficient to provide or adequate reclamation or abatement at the
site; (2) either unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed between August 4, 1977, and November 5, 1990, and the surety
of such mining operator became insolvent during such period, and as of November 5, 1990, remaining funds or other financial
guarantees are not sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement at the site; (3) the site meets priority
objectives stated in subsections (4) (A) and (B) of this rule. Priority will be given to those sites which are in the
immediate vicinity of a residential area or which have an adverse economic impact upon a community; and (4) monies
available from sources outside the fund or which are ultimately recovered from responsible parties involving lands
eligible pursuant to (1)(D) of this rule, shall either be used to offset the cost of the reclamation or transferred
to the fund if not required for further reclamation activities at the permitted site. The definition of left and abandoned
in either an unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed condition is revised to be consistent with these changes.



(2) Section 884.13(c)(2) Project Ranking and Selection Procedures



The AMLR Plan is revised to require the submittal of the Abandoned Mine Land Problem Area Description Form (OSM 76).
This form will be utilized in identifying problem area priorities and submitted to OSM upon project completion to
report actual reclamation accomplishments.

The AMLR Plan is revised to ensure that certain interim sites and insolvent surety sites mined after August 3, 1977,
may be eligible for AML funding. Additional ineligible sites would include sites and areas designated for remedial
action pursuant to the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 7901 

et seq.

) or that have been listed for remedial action pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 

et seq.

).



(3) Section 884.13(d)(3), Purchasing and Procurement



Missouri is adding provisions that restrict the eligibility of bidders and their subcontractors on AML contracts:
(1) to any bidder or equipment supplier whose firm or affiliate is not listed in the General Services Administration
publication entitled Lists of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement Programs; and (2) must
be eligible to receive a permit or conditional permit to conduct surface coal mining operations as confirmed by OSM's
Applicant/Violator System.

Missouri also adds a provision that AML State Share funds may be requested annually for the Future Reclamation Set-Aside
Program. The funds would only be utilized to accomplish the purposes of P.L. 9587 and only withdrawn after September
30, 1995. A separate accounting system would be utilized for these funds.
