FT  28 FEB 92 / World Trade News: EC's new associate states fear deficits
SENIOR officials from Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary yesterday welcomed
the Community's decision not to let last-minute difficulties over car quotas
and transit prevent trade provisions of their EC association accords coming
into effect on March 1.
But the officials told a conference here that the agreements might tip their
countries' expanded trade with the EC into deficit and might thus face some
difficulty in getting ratified in their parliaments.
The trade provisions, aimed at creating a free flow of industrial goods
between the Twelve and the three central European countries within the next
10 years, will apply from Sunday. But the full agreement, covering services,
labour, capital flows and political consultation, must await ratification by
all 15 national legislatures.
The new accords with central Europe cover:
Trade. The EC will remove most quotas at once, and tariffs over 2-5 years,
and the central Europeans will reciprocate more slowly by phasing out
tariffs and quotas over 4-10 years. To get duty-free entry into the EC,
central European goods must have at least 60 per cent local content.
Sensitive products. EC concessions on food, textile, steel and coal are
limited, but all curbs, except on agricultural goods, are to disappear.
Competition policy. The central European states are, within three years, to
start applying EC anti-trust law, but can give state aid to backward areas.
The EC will conduct anti-dumping inquiries. Capital. EC investors in central
Europe will be able to repatriate profits freely.
Services. In general, each side will allow the other's companies to
establish themselves on the same basis as its own companies. But the central
European countries need not let EC companies into their defence or financial
sectors.
Labour. The agreements do not allow more workers into the EC but those
already there will enjoy equal social benefits.
