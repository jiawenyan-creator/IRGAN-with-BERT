  [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Zou 
Jiahua has urged local governments to adopt measures to reduce 
losses and increase gains in all state owned enterprises. 
  In a telephone conference Thursday [10 March], Zou said that 
despite the successes last year, many state enterprises still 
suffered losses. 
  He said that the situation hindered the enterprises from 
development and indented local revenue. 
  He said that this situation has adversely affected the 
living 
standards of employees and social stability. 
  He called on government ministries, departments and 
localities to formulate plans and objectives for better 
performances. 
  He said that the focus should be on the coal, oil, textiles 
and light industries, especially enterprises suffering from 
losses amounting to over 40 percent and regions that lose more 
than 1 billion yuan. 
  The vice-premier said that the enterprises should adjust the 
structure of their products and develop new ones according to 
market demand. 
  He said that banks should issue loans to enterprises that 
are 
able to make up for losses.
