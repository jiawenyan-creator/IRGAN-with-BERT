  [Text] Guiyang, March 30 (XINHUA) -- More than 20,000 
families in poverty-stricken areas in southwest China's Guizhou 
Province recently moved to new houses thanks to a 
government-aided housing program. 
  Of the population of 37 million in the mountainous province, 
10 million are ethnic minority people. According to a survey in 
1986, some 40,000 families lived in shabby houses, most of whom 
were ethnic minority people in remote mountains. 
  Since 1984, the central government has allocated three 
million yuan to Guizhou every year to build houses for the 
farmers in poverty-stricken areas. 
  From 1986 to 1993, the province allocated 24 million yuan 
for 
housing construction for 24,994 households with 93,052 people. 
  Local officials said that the provincial government will 
continue the housing program by allocating special funds in the 
next few years.
