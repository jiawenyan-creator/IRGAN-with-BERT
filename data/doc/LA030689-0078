THE WORLD 
Poland disbanded three army regiments over the weekend, but Western military 
attaches invited to watch said they were unable to verify the numbers of men 
and weapons affected. Defense Minister Florian Siwicki announced plans last 
month to disband a motorized training regiment and two medium tank regiments 
under cutbacks totaling 40,000 men, 850 tanks and 30 fighter planes over the 
next two years. Polish media reports said about 1,000 conscripts were released 
from service early and entered the reserves as a result of the dissolution of 
the regiments. Western attaches said the moves were part of a restructuring 
that will produce a leaner but more effective Polish army, now estimated at 
394,000 men.
