PROFIT-TAKING HITS DOW AGAIN; INDEX OFF 11.97 
Stock prices lost more ground in profit-taking today, continuing the pullback 
that began in Tuesday's session. 
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 6.08 Tuesday, dropped another 
11.97 points to 2,773.36. 
Analysts said traders increasingly yielded to the temptation to cash in their 
gains after the market's rise to record highs last week and Monday. 
The tendency to lighten up was apparently heightened by a dimming of hopes for 
any moves soon by the Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy. Interest 
rates, which had been dropping in recent days on hopes of some stimulus from 
the Fed, rose in today's credit-market activity. 
In the broader market declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 453 up, 1,018 down and 498 unchanged. 
Big Board volume totaled 164.07 million shares, up from 147.56 million in the 
previous session. 
The NYSE's composite index fell 1.19 to 197.81. 
Bond Prices Decline 
Bond prices were slightly lower in dull trading early today. 
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was down 1/16 point, or 62 cents 
for every $1,000 in face value, at around midday. Its yield was unchanged from 
late Tuesday at 8.01%. 
Analysts said some traders continued to sell bonds to cash in gains made in 
last week's strong rally, but there were no fresh developments moving the 
market. 
Market participants are looking toward Friday's scheduled government report on 
wholesale price inflation for September as a possible source of direction for 
bond prices. 
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government 
issues were 1/32 point lower to 1/32 point higher, intermediate maturities were 
unchanged to 1/16 point lower, and 20-year issues had slipped 1/16 point, 
according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service. 
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, was down 0.43 at 1,184.85. 
In corporate trading, industrials also declined. Moody's investment grade 
corporate bond index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, had fallen 0.28 to 
333.64. 
Yields Mixed 
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.94% as the discount jumped 7 
basis points to 7.69%. Yields on six-month bills increased to 8.08% as the 
discount advanced 8 basis points to 7.67%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 
8.05% as the discount edged up 1 basis point to 7.51%. 
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8 7/8%, unchanged from late Tuesday.
