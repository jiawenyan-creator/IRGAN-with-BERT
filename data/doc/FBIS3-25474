minister, and his delegation at Aidid's Nairobi hotel residence. 
The delegation delivered messages from the Italian prime 
minister and foreign minister to Chairman Aidid, to the effect 
that Italy would withdraw its troops from Somalia and that 
Somali organizations should hold roundtable meetings to reach 
agreements on issues concerning Somalia.
