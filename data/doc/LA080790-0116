METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DWP TO OFFER TRAINING PROGRAM TO 1,000 
TEENS 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power will spend $5 million to fund a 
work training program for junior high and high school students in the Los 
Angeles Unified School District. 
During the next 18 months, the DWP's Youth Service Academy will sponsor about 
1,000 teen-agers who will work full or part-time for the city while attending 
vocational training classes and career guidance sessions. The program, which 
aims to prepare students to make the transition from school to the workplace, 
is open to all secondary students in the district. Students will be paid for 
their work, and will receive professional help from city employees who will 
serve as mentors.
