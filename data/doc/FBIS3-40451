  [Editorial Report] TSUSAN JANARU, produced monthly under 
the editorial direction of the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry (MITI), published an interview entitled ``Making 
the Most of Excellent Technical Capabilities'' with Masanori 
Yoshikai, chief of the Cast and Wrought Products Division of 
MITI's Machinery and Information Industries Bureau. 
  Yoshikai, responding to a question on recent developments in 
Japan's rapid prototyping (RP) industry, pointed to the 
applications for the technology--in which ultraviolet light is 
used to harden resin to make three-dimensional models--in such 
fields as automobiles, electronics, and medicine. Yoshiaki noted 
that a movement was under way to establish an RP industrial 
association, stated that MITI had high hopes for the 
organization, and expressed the ministry's support for its 
development.
