 

The NRC investigation and subsequent inspections revealed several violations. Enforcement action was taken by
the NRC against Atom Mechanical for violation of part 21 requirements, and against St. Mary's Hospital and Picker
International for violations of part 35 and part 30 requirements, respectively.

 Moreover, the State of Maryland determined from its own investigation that the incident at Anderson Memorial Hospital
resulted from a failure of the part, i.e., breakage of the return spring. No enforcement action was taken by the State
of Maryland.

Specifically, Atom Mechanical Company was found to be in violation of 10 CFR 21.21 (October 16, 1989), St. Mary Medical
Center was found to be in violation of 10 CFR 35.59(g), 10 CFR 35.605, 10 CFR 35.630(a), 10 CFR 35.615(d)(4), 10 CFR 35.632(a),
and 10 CFR 35.634(a) (October 17 and 26, 1989), and Picker International, Inc. was found to be in violation of 10 CFR
30.3 (subsequent to inspections that occurred on October 26 and November 9, 1989). Inspection reports are available
for review in the NRC Public document room. 
</FOOTNOTE>


Under current NRC regulations, persons authorized under a specific license to use devices containing byproduct
material (e.g., use of teletherapy equipment under a part 35 specific license) ultimately are responsible for the
safe use of these devices, and for assuring that such devices are properly maintained. Suppliers of sources or devices
containing byproduct material, whether they are an original manufacturer or a manufacturer of replacement sources
or devices, must be licensed under parts 30 or 32 or an appropriate Agreement State license, and also have responsibility
for the safety of the sources or devices that they supply or replace. Service or repair, which would include the replacement
of parts or components of medical or industrial sources or devices that present a risk of radiation exposure from the
failure of certain parts, such as the teletherapy devices discussed as examples in this petition, may be performed
only by qualified persons authorized under an NRC or Agreement State license (cf. 35.605, and 39.43(e)).
Some generally licensed devices may be serviced by general licensees who are authorized to perform limited service
work if sufficient information about the service work (e.g., procedures, training, expected dose, etc.) is submitted
by manufacturer or initial distributor and accepted by the NRC. However, these devices typically are not mechanically
complex and do not present the same risk of significant radiation exposure. Moreover, the NRC has no record of failure
of these devices leading to a radiation exposure attributable to defective replacement parts or improper servicing.
Finally, under the provisions of part 21, the supplier of any basic component,

 whether or not a licensee of NRC or an Agreement State, is also responsible for the quality of the component, whether
it is original or replacement.

A ``basic component'' is defined in part 21 as one, ``*** in which a defect could create a substantial
safety hazard.''

Reasons for Denial 


The NRC has examined the petition (1) in light of its regulations and policies for both general and specific licensees,
and (2) in view of the cases cited by the petitioner in support of the petition. The NRC is denying the petition because
current regulations apply equally to manufacturers and suppliers of both original and replacement parts, ensuring
the integrity of these parts; therefore, no additional requirements addressing the regulation of manufacturers
and suppliers of replacement parts are necessary. Further, current regulations address service and maintenance
of sources and devices possessed and used under an NRC license, including replacement parts, whether manufactured
or supplied by the original manufacturer or supplier or some other manufacturer or supplier. 
Accordingly, the petition for rulemaking is denied.
