FT  02 AUG 93 / Construction Contracts: Testing new material for road
building
A Pounds 4m contract, awarded to JOHN MOWLEM CONSTRUCTION for repairs to the
M18 in South Yorkshire, is to feature Britain's first trials of a new type
of reinforced concrete carriageway - 'whisper concrete'.
The project involves the reconstruction of two miles of both carriageways
near Thorne, from Junction 5, the M180 interchange to Junction 6 the A614
interchange.
The scheme is to include the construction of new concrete carriageways with
differing surface treatments.
One of these - exposed aggregate finish, sometimes knows as 'whisper
concrete' - originated in Europe and will be tested in Britain for the first
time. This finish is intended to give a quieter journey for motorists.
The performance of the road will be regularly tested by the Department of
Transport and the Transport Research laboratory.
