  [Text] Durban June 22 SAPA -- While the state of emergency 
in KwaZulu/Natal has lapsed legally, police in the region say it 
still stands, and the national cabinet has yet to decide on 
whether it will be maintained or not. The South African 
National Defence Force, at a media briefing in Durban on 
Wednesday [22 June], said while the security legislation lapsed 
21 days after the new government came to power, the emergency 
had not been lifted. 
  A SANDF spokesman said the implication was that soldiers no 
longer had such wide powers to search and seize. 
  But South African Police Services spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo 
said as far as he was concerned the emergency had not been 
lifted and was still in place. 
  At the end of May, National Defence and Safety and Security 
Ministers Joe Modise and Sidney Mufamadi met KwaZulu/Natal army 
and police chiefs to discuss violence. They promised to make 
recommendations to the cabinet on the continuance of the 
emergency. 
  Safety and security spokesman Craig Kotze said on Wednesday 
certain recommendations had been made to the cabinet which still 
had to make a decision on the issue. When the legislation 
lapsed the Human Rights Committee [HRC] opposed any 
re-enactment, saying it was unconstitutional and appeared 
unnecessary because political violence levels in the province 
had dropped. 
  The HRC said there were also no more detainees under the 
emergency, another reason for it not to be continued. The HRC 
and other human rights watchdogs are afraid police will abuse 
the vast powers they enjoy under the emergency. 
  However, both the HRC and regional peace committee say they 
are in favour of continued troop deployment to deter violence.
