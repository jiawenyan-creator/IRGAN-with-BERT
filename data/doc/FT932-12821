FT  27 APR 93 / Du Cann paid by failed company
FORMER Tory minister Sir Edward Du Cann was paid Pounds 9,000 as
vice-chairman of Homes Assured when the mortgage broking company was
insolvent, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
A further Pounds 416,000 went to other Homes Assured directors, members of
their families and companies associated with them at a time when the company
was trading fraudulently, the court was told. It collapsed in August 1989
with debts of over Pounds 9m.
Mr Michael Kalisher QC, prosecuting, said Sir Edward, a non-executive
director for much of the company's 19-month life, was not concerned with its
day-to-day running, but played an active role in raising finance for the
company and negotiating with insurance companies.
Homes Assured directors Mr Anthony Dobson, Mr Michael Robinson and Keith
Woodward all deny a joint charge of fraudulent trading. Mr Dobson also
denies two charges of procuring the execution of a valuable security by
deception and Woodward one charge of furnishing false information.
The trial continues today.
