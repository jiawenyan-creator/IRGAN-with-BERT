FT  11 DEC 92 / Australian unemployment worsens
Australia's unemployment rate worsened yet again in November, rising 0.1 per
cent to a new post-1930s record of 11.4 per cent, accentuating the depth of
the country's economic recession, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed the total number of people in
work fell from 7.71m to 7.64m.
Mr Kim Beazley, the federal employment minister, said economic growth of at
least 3 per cent was needed to begin to cut the unemployment rate. Last
month the Australian government shuffled spending programmes already
announced for the next 18 months, adding about ADollars 182m (Pounds 82m) to
job creation schemes.
The unemployment burden was spread unevenly across Australia's states, with
the biggest growth in South Australia, where the level rose from 11.4 to
12.2 per cent. The rate in Victoria rose from 11.8 to 12.1 per cent. Western
Australia achieved a cut from 11.3 to 10.6 per cent.
