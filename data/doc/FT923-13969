FT  10 JUL 92 / Letter: Executive options a lottery not reflecting
management effort
Sir, With reference to your article, 'Shareholder group calls for changes to
stock option plans' (July 6), it is unfortunate that, as with so many things
in life, the institutions are trying to make the best of a bad job.
Institutions and companies appear stuck in the trap of using existing
arrangements - executive options - the design of which has in reality been
substantially dictated by the Inland Revenue and only to a small degree by
the specific requirements of each individual company.
Is it not high time that, rather than tinkering with options, the
institutions and remuneration committees asked themselves what they are
trying to achieve by giving executives company shares? If they are to use
options as an incentive they should accept that the basic structure of
options, in the majority of cases, is totally inappropriate.
Because options are highly leveraged and dependent more upon the thoughts of
Number 11 Downing Street than the effort and corporate results of the
company, the benefits of an option end up being regarded as a lottery rather
than a benefit reflecting management effort.
Tinkering with performance measures may remove the windfall or market
(rather than company) gains under options, thereby removing some of the
extremes of the 1980s. However, applying such an on/off switch does little
to deal with the quantum of award or the quality of the incentive impact.
It is a pity if both the institutions and the remuneration committees, in
the light of corporate governance pressures and a growing realistic approach
towards executive remuneration, do not take this as an opportunity to go
back to basics and to draw up guidelines which can be used effectively to
give management incentive and reward by reference to shareholder reward,
rather than simply provide a lottery ticket which may or may not pay up.
