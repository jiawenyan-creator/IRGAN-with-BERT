from the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] Deputies of the North Ossetian Supreme Soviet 
decided today to agree to the interim administration's request 
for an extension of the state of emergency until 31 July. The 
interim administration is currently the only Russian federal 
authority accepting temporary responsibility for enforcing law 
and order and guaranteeing citizens' security here. 
  The present head of the interim administration is Vladimir 
Lozovoy, who holds the rank of deputy chairman of the Russian 
Government. He was appointed by Russian presidential decree and 
placed in charge of a mixed force of servicemen. He has been 
vested with greater powers than his six predecessors: 
  [Lozovoy] I have been given powers to speed up a solution to 
this conflict, to implement the government's decisions. We must 
engage the main factors -- which are political, legal, and 
socioeconomic. They must be uppermost in securing stability 
here.
