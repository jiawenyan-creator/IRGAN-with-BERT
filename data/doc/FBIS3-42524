  [Abstract] Images produced in the sensing of the Earth's 
surface with active and passive space-based systems are 
represented in binary form, with subsequently preliminary 
processing. Part of that processing involves local filtration. 
The work reported here examines procedures for recursive 
nonlinear filtration. A mathematical model of the procedures is 
constructed, and the probability efficiency of a recursive 
filter is compared with that of a nonrecursive filter (maximum 
probabilities of events are y = 1 and y = 0. With p = 0.1, the 
recursive filter produced a probability value of P(y = 1) = 
0.0122, whereas the nonrecursive filter produced a value of P(y 
= 1) = 0.28 &gt;  0.0122. With p = 0.9, the values changed to P(y 
= 
1) = 0.9882 and P(y = 1) = 0.972 &lt; 0.9882, respectively. By 
and 
large, a (2/3)[.sup]3[/] recursive filter produced better 
values than those of a similar nonrecursive filter. References
