  [Text] Six persons are under medical observation in Quito, 
with symptoms which indicate diphtheria, Nicolas Jara, acting 
minister of health, reported. 
  If it is confirmed that they are cases of diphtheria, up to 
this point there reportedly are 27 persons suffering from the 
disease. Last week 21 cases had already been confirmed. 
  The Ministry of Health has confirmed the death of two 
persons 
from diphtheria. Those deaths were due to carelessness by the 
persons concerned, who did not seek medical attention in a 
timely way. 
  Minister of Health Jara said that he does not have enough 
vaccine on hand to make it possible to begin a mass inoculation 
campaign for all residents of Quito. Nevertheless, he stated 
that the Izquieta Perez Institute has provided 50,000 doses of 
vaccine and that another 50,000 doses will be made available in 
the next few days. Furthermore, next week the Pan American 
Health Organization will provide 500,000 doses of the vaccine. 
  Jara said that the Ministry of Health is making sure that 
people living near a person suffering from diphtheria receive 
the necessary inoculations to prevent an epidemic from 
developing. 
  He warned people who choose to be inoculated by private 
medical personnel to go to well-known medical centers because, 
if they do not do so, they may be swindled. It is known that in 
some cases inoculations for infants are being given to adults, a 
situation which may be dangerous.
