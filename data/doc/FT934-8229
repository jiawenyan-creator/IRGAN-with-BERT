FT  17 NOV 93 / Rome heads for clash on steel
ITALY is heading for a confrontation with its European Union partners over
steel subsidies at tomorrow's meeting of industry ministers in Brussels.
The European Commission is today expected to back the hard line of Mr Karel
Van Miert, competition commissioner, on limiting subsidies to the EU's
state-owned steel industry and cutting capacity. That will set the scene for
what should be a stormy industry council tomorrow, with German, Italian,
Spanish and Portuguese ministers fighting corners for proposed restructuring
of state steelmakers.
Italy is unlikely to be isolated but Rome's restructuring plan for Ilva, the
loss-making state producer, will almost certainly be the only restructuring
plan not cleared by Brussels before the meeting. Political stakes are high
in Italy. Yesterday there were demonstrations by steelworkers in Taranto,
southern Italy, which is expected to bear the brunt of proposed closures.
Mr Van Miert is pressing for a 2m tonne reduction in capacity at Ilva as a
condition for allowing some Ecu2.58bn (Pounds 1.96bn) of state aid. But
negotiations between Mr Paolo Savona, Italy's industry minister, and Mr Van
Miert on Monday night, though cordial, broke up without agreement, and the
Commission said yesterday that it would not soften its line. 'It's up to
them to close furnaces; it's up to them how they do it,' said Mr Van Miert's
spokesman.
In the case involving east German steelmaker Ekostahl, the Commission last
night agreed an amended plan, including adjusted capacity cuts, with the
German authorities. But other member states, including Britain, believe
there may still be problems in agreeing even an amended Ekostahl plan,
because it involves building steelmaking capacity at a time when the EU
steel industry suffers from overcapacity.
