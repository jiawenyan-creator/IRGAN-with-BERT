VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA; 
SALE OF NATIVE PLANTS PLANNED BY SOCIETY 
Once wild-and-weedy native plants are making a place for themselves in home 
gardens, according to the California Native Plant Society, whose members are 
sponsoring a plant sale in Ventura today. 
In the past few years, many native plant species have been developed into 
tidier, more compact varieties, said Patt Wilson McDaniel, president of the 
Ventura County chapter of the nonprofit group. 
While society members have long found indigenous species desirable, popularity 
has swelled because of the new varieties and their water-saving habits, so CNPS 
plans to offer twice as many plants as in last year's sale, McDaniel said. 
Members will be on hand to share their expertise on cultivating the plants and 
will have literature available on local planting conditions. 
The one-day sale will run from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Ventura High School 
stadium parking lot off Poli Street west of Seaward Avenue. KATHLEEN WILLIAMS
