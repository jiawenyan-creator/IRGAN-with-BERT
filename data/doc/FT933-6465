FT  27 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Simpler is better for setting out tax
rules
Sir, Malcolm Bacchus is right to complain at the government's miserable
failure to deal with the enormous and unnecessary burdens of the tax and
accounting regulations ('Companies still weighed down by burden of tax
regulations', August 24).
For example, why does the Companies Act need to take more than 50 pages on
'Form and Content of Company Accounts'? Why not just have a single brief
section? It could say: 'The accounts of companies, and of groups of
companies where appropriate, should give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the company or group as at the end of the financial year, and
of the profit or loss for the financial year.'
If one wanted to elaborate, there could be a second sentence spelling out
what is currently implied: 'It would normally be expected that a set of
accounts would need to comply with current accounting standards in order to
give a true and fair view, though this might not be so in exceptional
circumstances.'
That would not only save much needless verbiage, it would eliminate the
existing contradictions between company law and accounting standards, for
example with respect to stock valuation, development costs, depreciation,
research, deferred taxation and pensions.
As for tax, hundreds, probably thousands, of the most intelligent people in
the country waste their time trying to interpret tax rules. May I ask how
many civil servants are employed full-time on trying to find ways to
simplify the rules?
