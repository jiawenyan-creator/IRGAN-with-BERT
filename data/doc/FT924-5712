FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Reorganisation puts Kalamazoo into red
KALAMAZOO, the computer services and printed systems group, slipped into the
red during the first half as it reorganised its unprofitable printed product
businesses.
The pre-tax deficit for the six months to September 30 1992 was Pounds
86,000 compared with profits of Pounds 1.54m at the same stage of the
previous year.
The Birmingham-based group has switched its year-end to March so that the
comparable figures for 1991 have been extracted from management accounts and
do not contain the results of US, Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries
sold in the last period for which it announced figures - covering the eight
months to March 1992.
Despite the deficit, an uncovered interim dividend of 0.25p, down from
0.525p, is declared.
The total distribution for the eight months to last March was 1.4p.
Earnings per share fell from 2.7p to nil.
Both the computer services and printed systems divisions kept up turnover,
bringing the overall total to Pounds 27.6m (Pounds 26.5m).
But while computer services saw operating profits decline slightly from
Pounds 1.97m to Pounds 1.78m, printed systems incurred an operating loss of
Pounds 442,000 against profits of Pounds 626,000.
The printed systems side has been weeding out unprofitable businesses - a
rationalisation which cost 70 jobs and led to reorganisation costs of Pounds
800,000.
Kalamazoo has withdrawn from the Polish market after operating losses in the
last six months of Pounds 110,000.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 850,000 related to a provision against
money due from the buyer of Live Free or Die Software, the group's former US
subsidiary.
The group expects to finish the year in the black, helped by a seasonal
boost for printed systems and an upturn after Christmas in new business for
computer services.
Directors warned, however, of 'the continuing uncertainty that surrounds our
marketplace.'
