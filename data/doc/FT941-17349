FT  05 JAN 94 / MPs may probe milk reforms
The Commons agriculture committee is likely to hold an inquiry into the
reorganisation of the Milk Marketing Board if government objections to the
board's plans to become a farmers' co-operative are not rapidly resolved,
Alison Maitland writes.
The milk market in England and Wales is due to be opened to competition on
April 1 after 60 years of domination by the board, which buys all milk from
farmers and sells it to dairies.
But the government's rejection of the board's plans last month has cast
doubt over whether approval can be achieved in time. The government was
responding to European Commission objections to the board's proposal to
transfer the bulk of its assets directly to the new co-operative, Milk
Marque.
Board officials are this week meeting the Dairy Trade Federation, which
fears Milk Marque will in effect be a new monopoly.
The delay has pushed back the flotation of Dairy Crest, the board's dairy
products subsidiary.
