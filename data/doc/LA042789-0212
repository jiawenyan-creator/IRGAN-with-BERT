P. M. BRIEFING; 
FORD REPORTS $1.64 BILLION EARNINGS 
Ford Motor Co. today said its first-quarter earnings rose nearly 1% to $1.64 
billion, the second-most profitable three-month period in automotive history. 
Ford, the nation's second-largest auto maker after General Motors, said its 
first-quarter results translated to $3.44 per share, and compared with earnings 
of $1.62 billion, or $3.31 per share, in the first three months of 1988. 
Revenue totaled $25.87 billion, up 11.5% from $23.2 billion during the first 
three months of 1988. 
Ford said its first-quarter profit was buoyed by increased profits overseas, a 
continuing source of money for the auto maker. The company said its U.S. 
profits fell 5.6% to $800 million during the quarter, principally because of 
sluggish sales and costs of incentives. 
GM last week reported first-quarter earnings of $1.55 billion. Chrysler Corp. 
is expected to release first-quarter results next week.
