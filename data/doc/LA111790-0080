PACIFICA EDGES FULLERTON, 24-20; TUSTIN IS NEXT 
Quarterback Chris Castellano connected with wide receiver Scott Lesser on a 
five-yard pass play with 6 minutes 59 seconds remaining to give Pacifica High 
School a 24-20 victory over Fullerton in a Division VI first-round playoff game 
Friday night. 
Pacifica (8-3) advances to a second-round game next weekend against Tustin. 
Pacifica took a 2-0 lead on a safety when Fullerton's David Chacon fielded a 
punt at his own one-yard line and tried to escape the Mariner coverage by 
running around the end zone, only to be met by Pacifica's Kevin Harbour. 
But Fullerton (8-3) responded with two touchdowns, taking a 14-2 lead. 
The Indians scored on a nine-yard run by David Chacon and on a one-yard bootleg 
by his twin brother, quarterback Daniel Chacon. 
David Chacon set up the second Fullerton touchdown by intercepting a Castellano 
pass at the Fullerton 35-yard line and returning it 51 yards. 
But Pacifica closed the gap to 14-9 on a one-yard keeper by Castellano with 39 
seconds left in the half. That touchdown came aftera pass interference and a 
personal foul call against David Chacon, who was playing safety, on a pass 
intended for Lesser. The penalties gave Pacifica a first-and-10 at the 
Fullerton 14. 
Fullerton continued the see-saw battle with a three-yard touchdown run by D.C. 
Olsen in the third quarter, but Pacifica mounted its final, decisive comeback. 
Pacifica's Derek Nicholson, who had 66 yards in 17 carries, scored from two 
yards out, and Castellano hit Chris Maroney on the two-point conversion to cut 
Fullerton's lead to 20-17. 
Four minutes later, Castellano connected with Lesser for the winning touchdown. 
Castellano completed 14 of 20 passes for 138 yards, but was intercepted three 
times. 
Daniel Chacon was 12 of 24 for 167 yards.
