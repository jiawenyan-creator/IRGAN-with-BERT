  [Text] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 19 May -- Federal 
Judicial Police [PJF] units seized 607 kg of marijuana and 
detained a band of drug traffickers formed by members of the 
Municipal Directorate of Public Security and Transportation. 
  Roberto Villalta, who was wearing his work uniform, Gerardo 
Calderon, Patricio Esparza, and another unidentified person were 
taken into custody in the operation. 
  Residents of Bolivia Street, El Barreal Neighborhood, 
reported seeing policemen and Public Security and Transportation 
vehicles constantly arriving at a warehouse where the PJF later 
seized the marijuana. 
  The PJF said it seized 606.84 kg of cannabis and two scales 
used to package the drug. 
  The officers who participated in the operation also 
confiscated a black Chevrolet van with gray stripes bearing 
Texas license plates and a red Pontiac Grand Am with Colorado 
plates. 
  The police said they will continue their investigations and 
hope to make several arrests in connection with the bust. 
  In a related story, the Attorney General's office destroyed 
two plantations in Sinaloa and Baja California estimated to

units converged on the area and destroyed marijuana plants and 
heroin poppies growing on 3.5 square meters.

machetes, an axe, a container of gasoline, two 22-caliber 
rifles, one 30-30 caliber and six 7.62-caliber cartridges, a 
7.62 caliber clip, and a Chevrolet Blazer with California plates.
