FT  11 MAR 93 / Finance warning on homes for rent
FINANCIAL institutions will be less willing to lend money to build homes for
rent if the government proceeds with cuts in the housing budget, the
National Federation of Housing Associations says.
The federation last night launched a campaign to persuade the government to
withdraw cuts announced in the Autumn Statement.
The grant paid to housing associations which build homes for rent would fall
from 72 per cent of the cost this year to 55 per cent in 1995-96. The
balance is raised on the capital markets.
The federation commissioned a study of the consequences of falling grant
rates from stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. This predicted that rents would
rise by 70 per cent over the next three years to meet the interest bill on
the higher proportion of private finance. Higher rents would increase the
number of housing associations dependent on social security benefits to 85
per cent.
This would make it harder for housing associations to attract private
finance, the federation warned. Investors would worry about the quality of
the income stream to service debt if it was too dependent on social security
benefits which could be cut in the future.
