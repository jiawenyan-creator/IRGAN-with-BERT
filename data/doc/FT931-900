FT  27 MAR 93 / Tory MPs urge help for tax-hit oil companies
THERE IS growing political pressure on the government to provide
transitional relief for oil companies affected by changes to Petroleum
Revenue Tax announced in last week's Budget.
Some Conservative politicians are calling for help for smaller oil
exploration companies, which stand to lose most from the tax changes.
The government plans to reduce the rate of the tax on existing oilfields
from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish it on new fields. It has also
removed the tax allowances for exploration and appraisal, which will hit the
small independent companies hardest.
The industry is split on the issue and some oil exploration companies such
as Amerada Hess have mounted intense lobbying campaigns against the tax
changes. Others, such as British Petroleum, have stressed the benefits of
the new regime.
In a written reply to a parliamentary question, the Treasury said yesterday
that: 'offshore activities deemed to be commercially viable prior to the tax
changes should be unaffected by the changes'.
But Mr George Kynoch, MP for Kincardine and Deeside, told Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, that some of the smaller companies would need transitional
relief in the move to the new regime.
'I'm making sure I convey the difficulties some companies are incurring in
the transitional period so that the chancellor can make some fine-tuning at
the committee stage,' Mr Kynoch said yesterday. He is gathering evidence
from a range of companies to present to the Treasury after the Easter
recess.
Present arrangements for the move to the new tax regime state that any
companies with outstanding contracts for drilling work will still be able to
claim exploration and appraisal relief. Many independent companies want
those arrangements not only to include firm contracts, but also obligations
for drilling programmes made to the government.
