FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Japanese move on European bonds
 -Investment interest is strong
High yields and the potential for currency appreciation are proving strong
incentives for Japanese investors to switch into the European government
bond markets, given that yields on Japanese government debt and US Treasury
bonds are pitifully low.
Japanese investment in overseas markets reached Dollars 35bn in the final
quarter of 1993, the highest quarterly figure since the last three months of
1989, according to DKB International, the Japanese bank. Some Dollars 26.4bn
of that was invested in overseas bonds, notably European markets.
'Japanese investors have been moving into Europe in the last few months and
have been strong supporters of the gilt market, as well as buying French and
German bonds,' points out Mr Kit Juckes, economist at S. G. Warburg
Securities. He expects to see further investment by Japanese investors in
European bonds, given that the yields are significantly higher than those on
Japanese paper.
Dealers in London note that Japanese buying interest in the European
government bond markets - particularly France, Germany and the Netherlands -
has been strong since the start of the year, although there has some
profit-taking in the UK and European markets to cover losses in the Japanese
domestic markets.
Many Japanese investors expect to see a further rally in European bond
markets this year, especially if the Bundesbank lowers interest rates and
other European central banks follow suit.
Mr Mikio Kashiwagi, head of overseas pension portfolio management at IBJ NW
Asset Management, says: 'Europe is definitely interesting at the moment.'
During the past few months, he has gradually shifted funds out of the US
government bond market into Europe where interest rates are high and there
is scope for yield curves to 'normalise' by adopting a positive slope as
short-term interest rates decline.
Mr Kashiwagi is placing 40 per cent of his funds in bonds and 60 per cent in
stocks: half of the fixed income allocation will be in European bonds, while
26 per cent will be in US paper and 16 per cent in Japanese debt.
Mr Junya Nakamura, manager of Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance's international
investment department, currently puts 40 per cent of his bond investments
into Europe and 60 per cent in the US. But while the total amount allocated
to overseas investments has remained stable, he has shifted funds out of the
US into Europe, reducing exposure in US bonds from 80 per cent last year to
the current level.
'We've started to get cautious about the UK, but we think countries on the
continent still have room to cut rates,' says Mr Nakamura.
'We've been overweight in Europe since the start of last year,' says a fund
manager at a leading Japanese life assurer. However, he believes that
European bond markets are in the last stages of a rally, and would not
increase weightings further.
Some Japanese investors are wary of overseas investments because of the risk
of currency fluctuations, and are sticking to domestic bonds in the hope of
a further fall in long-term yields. (The yield on the benchmark No 157
10-year bond is trading at around 3.55 per cent.)
Mr Kazuo Tamayama, director at Yasuda Kasai Brinson Investment Management,
who expects the Japanese currency to remain at around Y110 to the dollar
this year, is keeping away from overseas investments. He believes there is
potential for gains on Japanese government bonds and is about 10 per cent
overweight.
However, fears of heavy new supply in the Japanese government bond market
have dampened enthusiasm recently. The economic stimulus package could mean
extra supply for the bond market, and the Ministry of Finance has already
announced that it would issue bonds outright to finance the spending part of
the package. According to an outline announced by the Ministry of Finance
last week, the proposed tax cuts - worth Y6,000bn a year - would be financed
by deficit-covering bonds in the first three years.
In terms of the currency outlook, Japanese investors appear divided. In many
cases, positions in European bonds held by Japanese investors have been
fully hedged, keeping worries over currency movements at a minimum, although
this can be costly and reduces the overall return.
Mr Nakamura believes that the yen will remain relatively firm against
European currencies. However, other Japanese investors see scope for making
gains from the appreciation of the European currencies against the yen. A
dealer at one US bond house notes that 'even the Japanese are rather bearish
on the yen, and feel they could get currency appreciation from their
European assets'.
