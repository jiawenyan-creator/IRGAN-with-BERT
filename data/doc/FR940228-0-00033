<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain British Aerospace Model ATP
airplanes. This action requires inspections to detect damaged main landing gear (MLG) wheel bearings and replacement
of discrepant parts. This amendment is prompted by reports of failure of the MLG wheel bearings. The actions specified
in this AD are intended to prevent detachment of a MLG wheel from the airplane.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Effective March 15, 1994. 


The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the
Federal Register as of March 15, 1994. 
Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before April 29, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain British Aerospace Model ATP airplanes. The CAA advises that reports
have been received of failure of the main landing gear (MLG) wheel bearings on Model ATP airplanes. Investigations
are under way to determine the cause of these failures. This condition, if not corrected, could result in detachment
of a MLG wheel from the airplane. 


Jetstream has issued Service Bulletin ATP3248, Revision 1, dated January 28, 1994, that describes
procedures for performing daily and pre-flight detailed visual inspections to detect damage or discoloration of
the main wheel hub caps and of the outer side of the inflation valve side hubs on the MLG wheels. (This service bulletin
references Dunlop Service Bulletin AHA 1663321088, Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994, as the appropriate
source of service information.) The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued CAA Airworthiness
Directive 0071293, dated December 22, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these
airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of the MLG wheel bearings, which
could result in detachment of the MLG wheel from the airplane. This AD requires daily and pre-flight detailed visual
inspections to detect damage or discoloration of the main wheel hub caps and of the outer side of the inflation valve
side hubs on the MLG wheels. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the Jetstream service bulletin
described previously. 
This AD also requires replacement of the entire MLG wheel assembly and bearings with a serviceable wheel assembly
and bearings, if any damage or discoloration is detected during any inspection. The replacement is required to be
accomplished in accordance with the airplane maintenance manual. 
Operators should note that, although Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP3248, 
Revision 1, dated January 28, 1994, specifies that certain pilots may perform both the daily and pre-flight inspections,
it is the FAA's determination that both inspections must be performed by appropriately certificated maintenance
personnel, as specified in 43.3 of the FAR (14 CFR 43.3). 
This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider further
rulemaking. 
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.
