Total recoverable reserves are estimated to be 11,136,600 tons. 

 


The coal beds present in this revised application area are the Upper and Lower McAlester Coals of Pennsylvanian Age.
About 7.5 miles of cropline are present in this area, which now contains 1,933.46 acres. The Upper McAlester Coal averages
2.1 feet thick, and the Lower McAlester Coal averages 2.0 feet thick. In general, the Upper McAlester is more consistent
in thickness than the Lower McAlester which has a tendency, in places, to change to a boney coal and develop shale splits
in the lower part of this bed. 

These two coals are separated by about 61 to 57 feet of gray shale in the Western two-thirds of this application, and
about 51 feet of gray shale in the Eastern third of this application. The Upper McAlester Coal overburden was described
consistently on the drill hole logs as gray shale. The drill hole information indicates that these two beds have an
average dip to the North of 6.9 degrees along the Western 3.5 miles (just west of the town of Red Oak), and an average dip
of 13 degrees (just East of the Town of Red Oak), on to the Eastern edge of the application area where the dip increases
to a little more than 17 degrees. 

The In-Place coal present in this area was calculated to be 5.1 million tons for the Upper McAlester Coal, and 6.0 million
tons for the Lower McAlester Coal. This is based on 1,800 tons per acre-foot using the above stated average thickness.


Minable reserve base and recoverable coal reserves for the area were based on (1) geology and coal quality data; (2)
assumptions used in determining maximum economic recovery for the original lease application report; and (3) data
adequacy standards for Federal coal leasing in Southeastern Oklahoma. 

There are no quality analysis in the CRO-CDP maps which can be specifically identified with this tract. However, from
Trumball, et al., 1957, we have the following quality data for the McAlester Coal in this part of Oklahoma: Moisture_2.5
percent; Volatile Matter_31.6 percent; Fixed Carbon_66.3 percent; Ash_11.7 percent; Sulfur_3.2 percent; and
BTU/lbunknown.
