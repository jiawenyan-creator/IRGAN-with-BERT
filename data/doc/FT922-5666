FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: JVC, Hughes in video venture
HUGHES Aircraft of the US and Victor Co of Japan (JVC) are forming a joint
venture to make video projectors, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Sales of projection television equipment are expected to take off with the
introduction of advanced television systems in the 1990s.
The new California-based company, called Hughes-JVC Technology, this autumn
will start marketing a professional model of a projection TV, which shines a
video image on a large flat screen.
Additional models will follow next year and a consumer version is due in
1994.
The projectors are based on liquid-crystal light valve technology developed
by Hughes Aircraft, a division of GM Hughes Electronics Corp.
Hughes says it has been working with this technology for 20 years in defence
applications, which account for most of its revenues.
JVC, with its long experience in the audio-visual business, will contribute
manufacturing and marketing acumen to the joint venture.
The worldwide market for projection television is about 500,000 units a year
for consumer models, with another 25,000 for professional use.
Sales are expected to boom in the 1990s as the spread of high definition
television (HDTV) creates demand for screens big enough for viewers to
appreciate its crystal-clear images.
Clark Equipment, the US motor equipment and construction machinery group, is
to sell its material handling business to Terex for Dollars 95m. The
business employs 1,400 people worldwide.
