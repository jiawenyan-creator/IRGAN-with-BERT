COMMUNITY DIGEST : WHITTIER; 
REPLACEMENTS SOUGHT FOR REJECTED SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS 
Officials of the East Whittier City School District will meet Friday to discuss 
what books will be used temporarily in place of the controversial "Impressions" 
textbooks, which have been labeled morbid and tainted by some parents. 
The district board voted at its Monday night meeting to send the "Impressions" 
series back to the publisher, Holt, Rinehart and Winston of Canada Ltd. The 
action was taken after a long, closed-door session in which board members 
decided that the publishers breached their contract by sending the district 
books that were different from what they had advertised last spring. 
Elementary schoolteachers are currently surveying the libraries and resource 
reserves to find alternate books. 
The district is demanding a $160,000 refund from the publisher.
