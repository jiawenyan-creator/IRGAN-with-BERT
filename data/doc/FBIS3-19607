<F P=106> [Statement on first round of cantonal elections by Charles </F>
Pasqua, minister of the interior and territorial development -- 
live] 
  [Text] We are no longer in the realm of projections but in 
that of results. Out of 1,922 cantons where elections were 
taking place we now have final results for 1,563 cantons and 
13.5 million registered voters. The turnout was 62 percent, and 
valid votes represented 59 percent, that is 7.97 million votes. 
The majority gets 3.63 million votes, that is 45.7 percent. 
The Left, all of the Left, gets 3,284,000 votes, that is 41.2 
percent, 10.7 percent for the Communist Party and 22.7 percent 
for the Socialist Party. The Greens get 250,000 votes, that is 3 
percent. The National Front gets 725,000 votes, that is 
slightly more than 9 percent. 
  Out of 1,641 cantons, 564 councillors have been elected or 
reelected in the first round, 400 of them are from the majority, 
101 are Socialists, 38 various left, and 20 are Communists. As 
far as the majority is concerned, 123 Rally for the Republic 
councillors have been elected, 154 for the French Democratic 
Union, and 123 various rightists have been elected. Eight of 
the nine members of the cabinet who were candidates in these 
elections were elected in the first round; the ninth got an 
absolute majority but will have to enter the second round since 
he did not get 25 percent of the votes of the registered voters. 
  As I said earlier, these cantonal elections demonstrate that 
the majority has strengthened its position one year after the 
March 1993 legislative elections and that the gains of the 
Socialist Party were mostly made at the expense of the Greens.
