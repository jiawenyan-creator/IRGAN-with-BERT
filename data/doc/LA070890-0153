PILOT DIES IN COLLISION WITH PLANE FLOWN BY ASTRONAUT 
A stunt plane flown by a space shuttle commander collided with another plane 
during a race at an air show Saturday, sending the second craft hurtling into a 
cornfield and killing its pilot. 
The victim was identified as Henry W. Jones Jr., a retired fighter pilot from 
Newport News, Va. 
The other plane, a single-engine Cassutt flown by astronaut Robert L. (Hoot) 
Gibson, landed safely at the New Braunfels Municipal Airport, 25 miles 
northeast of San Antonio. No one on the ground was injured, officials said. 
"The one that crashed was attempting to pass the one that did not crash . . . " 
said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman T. C. Miller. 
Jones' Mingus Special, also a single-engine plane, lost a wing in the crash and 
tumbled through the air, breaking into several sections as it crashed, Miller 
said. 
Gibson, 43, piloted an eight-day Challenger mission in 1984 and commanded the 
1986 Columbia mission and the December, 1988, Atlantis mission.
