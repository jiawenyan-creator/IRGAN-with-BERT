FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Engineering side holds back
Sulzer
Sulzer, the Swiss heavy engineering and medical technology group, yesterday
reported a depressed SFr34m (USDollars 26.5m) net profit for the first half
of 1994, on sales up 3 per cent at SFr2.68bn.
As it was the first full interim income statement published by the group, no
comparative figures were given.
Mr Erich Muller, finance director, said sales were abnormally low in the
first half, mainly because there was no large contract invoicing by the
engineering divisions. He foresaw a better second half, but feared the
negative impact of the strong Swiss franc.
Mr Fritz Fahrni, chief executive, softened his forecast, saying net income
would at least reach last year's level. In the spring he forecast an
increase.
Order intake rose 3 per cent in the first half to SFr3.2bn, a 6.5 per cent
rise in local currencies. Mr Fahrni said the positive trend had continued so
far in the second half.
Ruti, the troubled textile machinery subsidiary, is expected to make an
operating profit this year, thanks to lower costs and steady sales. The
Infra building equipment division has suffered a 10 per cent slide in
orders, but is likely to maintain its profit. Sulzer Medica, which makes
artificial human body parts, raised first-half sales by 4.4 per cent, in
spite of the pressure in many countries on health care costs. Its sales and
profit growth is expected to follow the recent trend.
The Winterthur division, which makes locomotives and hydraulic turbines, was
held back by restructuring charges.
