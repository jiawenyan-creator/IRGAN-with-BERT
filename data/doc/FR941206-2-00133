<DOCTITLE>First Brands Corporation, Grant Of Petition For Determination Of Inconsequential Noncompliance </DOCTITLE>



First Brands Corporation (FBC) of Danbury, Connecticut determined that some of its brake fluid failed to comply with
49 CFR 571.116, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 116, ``Motor Vehicle Brake Fluids,'' and filed an appropriate
report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573. FBC also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements
of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 

et seq.

) (now 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle
safety. 
Notice of receipt of the petition was published on April 7, 1994, under the designation of Docket No. 9419, and
an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 16685). On April 26, 1994, the docket was redesignated 9422 (59 FR
21800). This notice grants the petition. 
Paragraph S5.1.7, 

Fluidity and Appearance at Low Temperature,

 of Standard No. 116 states: 
When brake fluid is tested according to S6.7, at the storage temperature and for the storage times given in Table II_

(a) The fluid shall show no sludging, sedimentation, crystallization, or stratification; 
(b) Upon inversion of the sample bottle, the time required for the air bubble to travel to the top of the fluid shall not
exceed the bubble flow times shown in Table II; and 
(c) On warming to room temperature, the fluid shall resume the appearance and fluidity that it had before chilling.


Table II of S5.1.7 states that when the brake fluid is stored at ^40
&cir; 

#

 2
&cir; C. for 144 hours 

#

 4.0 hours, the maximum bubble flow time is 10 seconds. When stored at ^50
&cir; 

#

 2
&cir; C. for 6 hours 

#

 0.2 hours, the maximum bubble flow time is 35 seconds. 
NHTSA notified FBC that a sample of Prestone Brake Fluid, AS400, failed to meet the no-crystallization requirements
of S5.1.7 (NHTSA file NCI 3293). FBC's initial investigation determined that the brake fluid was packaged on May 4,
1993, at its subsidiary, Paulsboro Packaging, Inc., and that the fluid was manufactured by Union Carbide Corporation
(UCC) and identified as UCC's PM6060, lot 

#

 0319083. FBC further stated: 
All [of the] product in FBC's distribution system packaged from the specific lot 

#

 0319083 was placed on hold and all packaging of Brake Fluid PM6060 was ceased pending a full investigation and implementation
of corrective measures. 
FBC produced 202,704 units (12.0 fl.oz.) from lot 

#

 0319083, and currently has 61,752 units on hold at various warehouses. 


Based on review of all data and consultation with UCC, it is FBC's opinion that the noncompliance will not affect product
performance in a motor vehicle or create a safety concern. 

FBC is recommending that no recall of [the] product outside of FBC's distribution system be made. It is further recommended
that the product in inventory (61,752 units) also be released for sale. 
FBC also stated that it has elected to convert to an alternative UCC brake fluid identified as PM6340, which has a freeze
point of ^65
&cir; C., and will provide an added margin to meet the requirements of S5.1.7, Standard No. 116. 
In support of its petition, FBC attached a letter from UCC, dated January 17, 1994. The UCC letter describes the results
of tests it performed on samples of the noncompliant brake fluid: 
Specifically with regard to the DOT ``Fluidity and Appearance at Low Temperature'' test (FMVSS 116, Section 5.1.7),
Union Carbide Corporation, using the DOT FMVSS 116 procedure, performed the test at ^40
&cir; C for 6 days [144 hours] and ^50
&cir; C for 6 hours. Following completion of the tests: 



at ^40
&cir; C for 6 days, the sample passed all requirements. The sample met the requirements for appearance at low temperature,
bubble travel time and room temperature appearance-fluidity properties. 
^at ^50
&cir; C for 6 hours, the sample passed the requirements of bubble travel time and room temperature appearance-fluidity
properties. Upon completion of the 6 hours at ^50
&cir; C, some crystallization was noted in the sample. 
_attempts were made to isolate the crystallized material. It was a soft, non-abrasive gel that was difficult to isolate
as it flowed with the brake fluid.




Union Carbide Corporation also conducted the test of FMVSS 116, Section 5.1.7 on the sample with rigorous temperature
control at ^49
&cir; C 

#

 2
&cir; C to more closely realize the ^48
&cir; C limit of the test's specified temperature range (Section 5.1.7 test parameter: ^50
&cir; C 

#

 2
&cir; C). The sample was clear, showed no crystals, had a bubble travel time of approximately 5 seconds and regained
its appearance and fluidity at room temperature. These results were confirmed by a second run at the same conditions.
