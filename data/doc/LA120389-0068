TRIP OF THE WEEK: IT'S SNOW SEASON AGAIN IN THE SIERRA 
Mammoth Mountain was the first ski area in the Western United States to open 
this season, thanks to late-October storms that left two to four feet of snow 
on its slopes. With last weekend's snowfall there is still a base of three to 
four feet as the resort gears up for the winter. 
Average annual snowfall on the mountain is 18 feet. Thirty lifts transport 
thousands of skiers to the maze of downhill runs. Other skiers tour Mammoth's 
scenic countryside over cross-country trails. 
But skiing isn't Mammoth's only wintertime attraction. Visitors can ride 
through the snow on a dog sled, a horse-drawn sleigh or a snowmobile. Or they 
can sightsee in a hot-air balloon equipped with a basket mounted on skis that 
skim over the snow during landing. Other sports options are ice skating, 
snowshoe walking and sledding. 
The main draw of this resort town is its 11,053-foot inactive volcano that 
offers 3,500 acres of gentle-to-steep terrain for downhill skiers. Thirty 
percent of the slopes are designed for beginners, 40% for intermediates and 30% 
for advanced skiers. The longest run is 2.5 miles. 
Even if you don't ski, it's worth a ride to the summit of Mammoth Mountain in a 
pair of gondolas for a sweeping vista of the Eastern Sierra. Take Gondola 1 
from the Main Lodge to Mid-Chalet where refreshments are available, then 
continue to the mountaintop on Gondola 2. Round-trip sightseeing tickets are 
$6, children $3. 
For skiers, all-day lift tickets cost $35, half-day $25. Children pay half 
price, except those 6 years and under, who ski free. Skiers 65 and older also 
ride the lifts without charge. 
A new 10-X Ticket Book costs $290 (children $145) and lets you ski for 10 days 
at Mammoth and neighboring June Mountain any time during the season. Lower 
priced three- to five-day consecutive midweek, non-holiday tickets also are 
available. 
You'll find midweek lift and lodging packages at Mammoth Mountain Inn, which is 
a few steps from Main Lodge and the slopes. The per-person rate begins at $189 
for three days/three nights in a hotel-type room or $260 in a condo suite, 
including lift tickets. 
Regular per-night hotel room rates (single or double) at the inn are $69/$125 
midweek, $85/$140 on weekends. Some suites accommodate up to 13 guests and cost 
$200 midweek, $255 weekends. Call toll-free (800) 228-4947 or (619) 934-2581 
for reservations. 
The 214-room Mammoth Mountain Inn is at the Main Lodge ski area about six miles 
from the town of Mammoth Lakes, where there are many other accommodations in 
motels, condos and cabins. 
This season you can ride free to and from the slopes and around the town aboard 
a fleet of Mammoth Area Shuttle (MAS) buses. All are equipped with racks for 
skis and snow boards. 
Several companies offer activities in the snow, and you can book them through 
Mammoth Adventure Connection at the Mammoth Mountain Inn. Call (619) 934-0606. 
Especially popular are the dog sled excursions that depart from the inn through 
the woods to Minaret Vista. Mush with the huskies for a half hour ($27.50; 
children 12 years and under $16.50) or an hour ($60.50, children $27.50). Kids 
under 3 are free. 
You also can take a romantic dog-sled ride in the moonlight that begins with 
champagne and ends with dinner at the inn's Mountainside Grill or Yodler 
restaurant. The outings are operated by Dog Sled Adventures. Call (619) 
934-6270. 
The same company runs a team of sled dogs at Sierra Meadows at the edge of 
town. That's also where sleighs pulled by pairs of draft horses make excursions 
on Friday, Saturday and holiday evenings. Some include hot spiced wine and 
cider, others feature hearty ranch-style dinners after the ride. Call (619) 
934-6161 for rates and reservations. 
Guided hourlong horseback rides over rolling hills along Mammoth Creek also are 
offered at Sierra Meadows. And you can rent skis, boots and poles and take 
lessons for cross-country ski touring, as well as arrange for snowmobile 
rentals. 
DJ's Snowmobile Adventures has rentals and guided tours along U.S. 395 at 
Smokey Bear Flat, where there are 50 miles of trails to explore. Half hour 
guide outings cost $20 with one rider, $30 with two; hourlong excursions are 
$40 single, $55 double. Snowmobiles can be rented for $55 per person half-day,

For a bird's-eye view of the snowcapped Sierra, board the hot-air balloon that 
drifts over Mammoth from its launch site at Main Street (California 203) and 
Old Mammoth Road. Up to six adults ascend on the early morning flights. A 
one-hour aerial adventure costs $135 per person, or $150 with champagne brunch. 
Children 12 years and under pay half price. Contact High Sierra Ballooning at

Winds may carry the balloon over the Mammoth Lakes basin, where Tamarack Lodge 
Resort on Twin Lakes is a nordic ski center. More than 25 miles of groomed 
trails radiate from the rustic resort that has 11 rooms in the lodge and 26

higher on holidays. Call (800) 237-6879 for reservations.

Lakeside restaurant, one of the most popular in Mammoth. Other local favorites 
for food include Whiskey Creek, Roget's, The Mogul, Giovanni's (pizza), 
Berger's (hamburgers) and O'Kelly &amp; Dunn.
