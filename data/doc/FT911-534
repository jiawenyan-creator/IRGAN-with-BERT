FT  11 MAY 91 / Money Markets: Lending for 14 days
THE SHORT end of the money market stayed firm in London yesterday, as the
Bank of England sent a strong signal that it does not wish to see an early
cut in bank base rates.
On the previous four Fridays the central bank had underlined the present
rate structure by lending funds to the discount houses at 12 per cent for
seven days.
Yesterday the message was reinforced by lending at 12 per cent for 14 days.
This discouraged hopes that next Friday's UK retail price index for April
will be followed by a rate cut.
Overnight money was firm at around 12 1/2 per cent after the Bank of
England's action, but three-month interbank was little changed at 11 9/16
 11 7/16 per cent, compared with 11 9/16 -11 1/2 , continuing to discount a
cut of  1/2 point in base rates. One-year funds eased to 11 1/16 -10 15/16
from 11 1/8 -11 per cent.
Short sterling futures weakened in subdued trading on Liffe. June delivery
opened slightly lower at 88.90 and moved within a range of 88.86 to 88.93,
before closing at 88.88 against 88.91 previously.
Day-to-day credit was in very short supply on the cash market and the Bank
of England supplied the bulk of its assistance through late lending, keeping
overnight money firm throughout the day, and further reinforcing the message
on rates.
A shortage of Pounds 1,050m was initially forecast, but this was revised to
Pounds 1,150m at noon. Total assistance of Pounds 1,099m was provided.
In early operations the authorities bought Pounds 6m bills outright, by way
of Pounds 1m Treasury bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 5m bank
bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent.
Before lunch another Pounds 128m bills were purchased, by way of Pounds 5m
Treasury bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent; Pounds 23m bank bills in band 1
at 11 7/8 per cent; and Pounds 100m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per
cent.
In the afternoon the Bank of England did not offer to buy bills from the
market, but invited the discount houses to use their borrowing facilities. A
total of Pounds 965m was then lent to the market at 12 per cent for 14 days.
Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up
of Treasury bills drained Pounds 1,321m, with a rise in the note circulation
absorbing Pounds 530m and bank balances below target Pounds 120m. These
outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 920m to liquidity.
