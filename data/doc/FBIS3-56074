  [Text] Aivars Vovers, deputy secretary of state of the 
Foreign Ministry for eastern affairs, today summoned to the 
Foreign Ministry Valeriy Nesterushkin, counsellor to the 
ambassador of the Russian embassy in Latvia, to express 
bewilderment in connection with the statement by Russian 
Presidential Press Secretary Kostikov; the statement declared 
that in the future, when responding to incidents like that in 
Riga on 10 January, Russia will act taking into account American 
experience. 
  Vovers stressed that the ministry expressed bewilderment 
over 
this statement, because Latvia has already officially apologized 
to Russia, and the Latvian Government has categorically 
condemned the action by the guilty party and a criminal case has 
been started by the Latvian prosecutor's office.
