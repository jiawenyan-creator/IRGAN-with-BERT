IN BRIEF; 
3RD MOTORCYCLIST DIES ON ISLE OF MAN 
A motorcycle rider was killed in practice on Thursday on the Isle of Man 
Tourist Trophy circuit -- the third to die on the treacherous course this week. 
Organizers said Phil Hogg, 23, came off his 250-cubic-centimeter Yamaha when he 
was practicing for competition later in the day. 
Tuesday a rider and a sidecar-team member were killed in separate crashes 
during practices. The 37-mile circuit on the Irish Sea island has claimed 149 
lives since racing began there in 1907.
