PREP FOOTBALL ROUNDUP; 
INJURY STOPS SAVANNA'S 26-15 VICTORY WITH 2:16 LEFT 
An injury to Anaheim High School linebacker Say Iemsisanith prompted officials 
to end Thursday night's game with two minutes 16 seconds remaining and Savanna 
leading, 26-15. 
Iemsisanith, a team captain, was injured while assisting on a tackle. 
He remained on the field at Western High School for 45 minutes before being 
taken by ambulance to Humana Hospital-West Anaheim for X-rays. 
"The X-rays were negative," said Dan Miller, boys' athletic director at 
Anaheim. "There's no spinal cord injury. He was given some pain pills and is 
being kept overnight. The doctors will check him in the morning and probably 
release him." 
Vince Flores caught two touchdown passes to lead Savanna to the Orange League 
victory. 
Flores caught a nine-yard touchdown from Brad Belanger early in the first 
quarter. He added a 13-yard touchdown catch in the second quarter to make the 
score 14-7 at halftime. 
Anaheim's Brian Diaz, who scored twice, had an 86-yard fumble return that tied 
the score at 7-7 in the second quarter. Diaz's other touchdown came on a 
two-yard run in the fourth quarter. 
Savanna (4-2-2, 1-1-1 in league play) interceptedfour passes and forced two 
fumbles. Linebacker Paul Glomba intercepted two passes, returning one 53 yards 
for a touchdown to put Savanna ahead, 23-7. Leon Landry scored on a 30-yard run 
in the fourth quarter. Anaheim is 3-5, 1-2. SCOTT JONES
