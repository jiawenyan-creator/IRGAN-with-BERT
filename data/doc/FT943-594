FT  28 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: France plans to raise FFr20bn
in retail bond sales
The French government yesterday unveiled details of its plans to open the
government bond market to individual investors, announcing that it will sell
FFr20bn of bonds to the public in the year from the beginning of October.
The government had intended to offer about FFr10bn in the scheme but strong
demand from banks which will serve as the retail network has prompted an
increase.
The French economy ministry said that the aim of the scheme was to encourage
long term savings by individuals and to provide a facility which is already
available in many industrialised economies.
In the US, for example, savings bonds represent about 5 per cent of federal
debt. Under the French scheme, foreign individuals will also be able to
subscribe to the issues.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, denied the move was aimed
at reducing the country's dependence on foreign investors, who have reduced
their holdings of French bonds this year.
'You have to look at the amounts involved. The total borrowing programme for
1994 is for FFr500bn. In raising FFr20bn from private investors the state is
not trying to find a new means to finance its debt,' he said.
Mr Alphandery added that he thought the sale of French bonds by foreign
investors was a temporary phenomenon, which was normal in a period of bond
market turbulence.
Under the terms of the scheme, investors are to be offered 10-year bonds
with a face value of FFr2,000. They will pay banks a fixed commission of 2
per cent. The first bonds to be sold to individuals will have a coupon of
7.5 per cent, while the annual yield is expected to be about 7.8 per cent
after commission costs. This compares with a forecast inflation rate of 1.8
per cent for 1995, and a return of just under 5 per cent on money market
funds, the most popular savings instrument in France.
