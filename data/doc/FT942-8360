FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Profits surge at Power Financial
Power Financial, the financial services group controlled by Montreal
financier Mr Paul Desmarais, raised first-quarter earnings by 55 per cent,
writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Income jumped to CDollars 64.9m (USDollars 46.7m), or 72 cents a share, from
CDollars 39.6m, or 45 cents, a year earlier on revenues little changed at
CDollars 1.5bn. The gain came from strong contributions from Great-West
Life, the North American group life and health offshoot, and Investors
Group, the mutual fund unit.
