FT  12 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Share prices recover before
abrupt halt
Wall Street
After a sharp downturn yesterday morning, US share prices recovered to
finish at mixed levels in a session cut short because of severe winter
weather, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.56 at 3,894.78 by 2.30pm, when
blizzard conditions forced an abrupt halt to the trading day. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.25 better at 470.18. In the
secondary markets, the American SE composite dropped 1.93 to 477.20, and the
Nasdaq composite 2.03 to 781.39.
NYSE volume was light, with 219m shares exchanged in the abbreviated
session. But the snow prevented many from reaching their offices, so
activity was thin all day. That left the narrowly based Dow industrial index
vulnerable to sharp swings.
The first came in mid-morning. After a weak opening, share prices jumped 16
points in minutes as the US Treasury market began to extend some early
gains.
The rally in bonds was surprising in view of the day's mixed economic news.
The Commerce Department said that January producer price index had risen
only 0.2 per cent, less than forecasts of 0.3 per cent. But the core index,
excluding food and energy prices, was a little higher than anticipated.
Retail sales, meanwhile, showed a 0.5 per cent decline, but the data was
distorted by last month's frigid weather.
Near midday, equities struck an independent course from bonds after a drop
in the stock-index futures market triggered program sales. Analysts linked
the downturn to technical factors, rather than any fundamental economic
news.
At one stage, the Dow industrials had shed more than 22 points, but the
blue-chip index shifted direction once again in the early afternoon and
share prices pulled back to near their starting points.
Automobile stocks again led the blue chips. General Motors fell Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 61, Ford Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 65 3/8 and Chrysler Dollars
1 to Dollars 58 3/4 . Both GM and Ford posted strong earnings earlier in the
week, but investors appeared disappointed that forecasts had not been
surpassed.
In the healthcare sector, Columbia HCA was near the NYSE's most active list
a day after shareholders of the two companies approved a merger. The stock
was marked down Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 38 5/8 in volume of nearly 3.9m
shares, after the companies, listed separately, posted big gains the
previous session.
In computer stocks, Storage Technology gave back nearly all of its recent
gains after the company briefed analysts on its Iceberg computer storage
system. The issue slid Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 35 3/8 .
Canada
Toronto prices closed lower in relatively light trading, continuing the
downward trend that started yesterday afternoon.
The TSE-300 composite index fell 36.37 points, or 0.82 per cent, to
4,405.60. Declining issues outnumbered advances 498 to 307.
Volume was 67.08m, down from Thursday's 90.86m shares, and trading value
fell to CDollars 761.8 from CDollars 992.0m.
The market opened lower and had slumped more than 50 points by
mid-afternoon, before recovering some ground late in the session.
