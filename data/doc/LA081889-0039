GALLERIES: THE VALLEY 
The watercolor-marker whimsy of John Randolph Carter probably most strongly 
recalls the comic book-style drawing of Philip Guston. The 
stream-of-consciousness drawing also evokes bored adolescents doodling away 
during high school math class. Carter's images have that kind of free flowing 
fantasy -- an exuberance unimpeded by narrative consistency. In drawings like 
"Orange Monster With Floating Faces and Small Animals," they simply exult in 
extraordinary forms that mutate as they come flowing out of the pen to be set 
ablaze with bright color. 
This kind of hedonistic outpouring from the unconscious flavors all the 
earliest work. It's fun and joyous even though the lack of meaning eventually 
nags at the vacuous, colorful designs. 
Later imagery in black and white communicates a troubled, ruminative edge. In 
one, four figures passively sit with bags over their heads like prisoners 
awaiting the gallows. The same figure and one doppelganger appears in a drawing 
that fairly breathes with frustration about going nowhere on a butcher block 
island between freeways and oceans. 
From these few recent drawings it's difficult to tell if the more complex, 
thought-provoking imagery is a new direction for Carter's cartoons. If so, the 
emotional power is a welcome addition to work already at home in the surreal 
arena of the unconscious. (Orlando Gallery, 14553 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks,
