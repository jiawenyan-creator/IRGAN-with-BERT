FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Water appeals referred to the MMC
Ofwat, the water industry regulator, yesterday formally referred appeals
from two water companies on tougher price limits to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
The MMC is expected to make its decision by March 28, although it could
apply for a six-month extension.
South West Water and Portsmouth Water last month requested Ofwat to refer
the price limits, which were set in July. South West, which has been hit in
recent years by the costs of meeting sewage treatment standards, is also
appealing over a reduction in connection charge limits from Pounds 1,000
each for water and sewerage services to Pounds 200.
