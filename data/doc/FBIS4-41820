  [Text] Moscow, 27 Jun -- Boris Yeltsin does not support 
Vladimir Shumeyko's initiative on extending the powers of the 
Federal Assembly's deputies and on upgrading the status of the 
upper chamber, Sergey Filatov, head of the Russian president's 
administration, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent today. A 
relevant statement from the presidential press secretary is 
expected. 
  "The implementation of Vladimir Shumeyko's initiative would 
obliterate all our work for attaining civil and public accord in 
Russia. In addition, we should not provide the opposition with 
a pretext for accusing us of power craving", the Filatov said. 
In Sergey Filatov's view, the fact that the parliament's upper 
chamber today represents the interests of the components of the 
Federation is an exclusive achievement of the Constitution. 
According to him, the results of opinion polls show that fear 
of Russia's possible collapse and fear of civil war are 
decreasing in society. "The fear of the country's possible 
collapse has been overcome precisely because the new 
Constitution gives the regions an opportunity to implement their 
interests by approving or rejecting laws. To turn the 
Federation Council into a politicized body, therefore, would be 
"tantamount to death for the Federation," the head of the 
presidential administration stressed. 
  According to him, Boris Yeltsin shares Sergey Filatov's 
concern about Vladimir Shumeyko's initiative to revise a number 
of articles of the Constitution and invest the Federation 
Council with broader powers. 
  Asked by an ITAR-TASS correspondent whether the presidential 
apparatus is going to appraise the responsibility of politicians 
for statements which destabilize society, Sergey Filatov said: 
"We are not a politburo; let the people, who elect politicians, 
appraise their actions".
