  [Text] Seoul, April 1 (YONHAP) -- Thousands of North Korean 
loggers in the far eastern area of Russia have been working at 
nearby vegetable fields lately, Radio Moscow reported on 
Thursday. 
  According to the NAEWOE PRESS here, the radio said about 
7,000 North Korean loggers were working at vegetable fields in 
the Khabarovsk Province after Russia and North Korea failed to 
resolve the issue of renewing their logging agreement that 
expired at the end of last year. 
  It went on to say that the internal affairs authorities of 
Khabarovsk urged the North Korean consulate general in the area 
to strictly abide by rules on foreigners employment while a 
large fine was imposed on a Russian industry for employing the 
North Korean loggers without a proper permit. 
  The Khabarovsk authorities fear that the North Korean 
loggers 
may become "second Vietnamese," said the radio, reminding that 
tens of thousands of Vietnamese people who worked in Russia in 
the past scattered all across Russia as illegal traffickers.
