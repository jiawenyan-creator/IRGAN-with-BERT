FT  08 OCT 92 / Letter: An alternative view of the rate of life policies
lapsing
Sir, There was one aspect of the article about Scottish Widows that I fear
may have seriously misled your readers ('Scottish Widows ordered to review
20,000 life policies', October 7).
The article quoted figures from a survey carried out by the Securities and
Investments Board of policies which were terminated within the first two
years of the contract. However, this month's edition of Money Management
shows a rather different picture and, indeed, of the offices surveyed,
Scottish Widows has the lowest rate of policies lapsing - only 4 per cent
compared with the 22 to 45 per cent mentioned in the article.
The very thorough analysis we have carried out of policies sold by appointed
representatives has indicated no significant difference in lapse rates when
compared with Scottish Widows policies sold through independent financial
advisers.
