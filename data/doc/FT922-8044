FT  15 MAY 92 / Union aims to disrupt BBC
BECTU, THE broadcasting union, forecast that BBC news and sports programmes
might be disrupted today by industrial action called to protest against
Producer Choice.
Mr Tony Lennon, Bectu president, said: 'The management will have difficulty
maintaining a service.'
Producer Choice is the BBC policy of giving producers the right to chose the
services they need - everything from camera crews, to makeup and studios -
in the outside market. The union fears thousands of jobs will be lost as a
result.
The strike will last for eight hours, from noon today.
