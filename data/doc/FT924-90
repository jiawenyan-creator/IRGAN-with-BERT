FT  31 DEC 92 / Dublin to lift exchange curbs
Officials at the Central Bank of Ireland confirmed yesterday that Ireland
will go ahead with the removal of exchange controls this weekend, as part of
the European Community's single market programme, writes James Blitz.
There had been speculation that Ireland might be forced to postpone its
pledge because of pressure on the Irish punt inside the ERM.
