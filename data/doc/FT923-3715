FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Pepsi-Cola, NZ brewer in soft
drink venture
PEPSI-Cola International, part of the US PepsiCo group, is to form a joint
venture with Lion Nathan, the New Zealand brewer, to produce, distribute and
market PepsiCo soft drinks in Australia and New Zealand, the companies
announced yesterday.
The venture will have combined sales of more than NZDollars 200m (USDollars
107.5m) in a highly competitive market.
Lion Nathan, the biggest liquor group in Australasia, has been the sole
producer of Pepsi products in Australia since 1990. The joint venture will
also incorporate the New Zealand operations owned by Pepsi.
It will be 83 per cent owned by Lion Nathan and 17 per cent by Pepsi. The
companies said the equity stakes reflected the values of their respective
businesses.
The venture will be managed by Lion Nathan, which last year had sales of
more than NZDollars 2bn.
The managing director will be Mr William Wilson, formerly group
vice-president for PCI Asia. He will be based in Sydney.
Mr Douglas Myers, chief executive of Lion Nathan, said his company had
invested heavily in the Australian soft drink market, and recently opened a
ADollars 50m (USDollars 35.7m) facility in Sydney.
The company's soft drink sales were up 20 per cent in the past year, in
spite of the Australian recession, Mr Myers said.
In the US, Pepsi said it saw considerable efficiencies to be gained from
combining the Australian and New Zealand operations, given the similarities
of the two countries' markets.
No cash was involved in the deal, but the US soft drinks, snacks and
restaurants group said that it expected some 'aggressive' investment in the
joint venture - in proportion to the shareholdings.
