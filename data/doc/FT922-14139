FT  08 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cominco quest for troubled lead
smelter alternatives continues
COMINCO has taken another step towards abandoning the German QSL technology
used for its troubled lead smelter at Trail, British Columbia.
The Vancouver-based company says in its latest annual report that it has
retained Snamprogetti of Italy to prepare 'preliminary engineering and cost
estimates' for converting the facility to the Kivcet process used by
smelters in Russia and Italy. Cominco sent a shipment to a Kivcet pilot
plant in Russia last October as part of its evaluation of alternatives to
the QSL process.
The CDollars 135m Trail smelter, with a design capacity of 160,000 tonnes a
year, has been idle since March 1990, when it was shut down three months
after being commissioned. Cominco and Lurgi, the German engineering group
which designed the QSL process, have spent the past two years working to
improve the smelter's performance. Lurgi is hoping to use similar technology
in lead smelters in several other countries. The main problem at Trail has
been in the reduction chamber of the 40-metre long reactor, where natural
gas has replaced pulverised coal as the reducing agent.
Lead operations have continued, using the old, high-cost smelter that the
QSL facility was designed to replace. Production totalled about 87,000
tonnes last year.
Three sets of tests were conducted last year on a smaller QSL smelter at
Stolberg, Germany. Cominco disclosed that while these tests showed that gas
was as effective a reducing agent as coal, the smelter 'was unable to
achieve stable commercial operations at acceptable cost levels'.
A Cominco representative said the tests at Stolberg were continuing. The
company may delay a decision on the the Trail smelter, which was expected by
the end of June 1992. Cominco said that Lurgi, which is a subsidiary of the
German metals group Metallgesellschaft, is contractually required to make
and pay for any modifications to the Trail facility required to meet
performance guarantees. It added that, given the uncertainty on the
smelter's future, it could not yet determine the size of the write-down, if
any, which may be required.
