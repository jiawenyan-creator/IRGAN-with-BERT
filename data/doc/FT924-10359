FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Platon improves to show profit
Platon International, the maker of flow, level and pressure measuring and
controlling instruments, has started to recover, reporting a pre-tax profit
of Pounds 12,000 in the half year ended October 2 1992.
That compared with losses of Pounds 299,000 in the corresponding period and
with Pounds 248,000 in the preceding six months.
In the latest period a deficit of Pounds 200,000 was incurred in April and
May, but June-September produced a profit of Pounds 212,000. Prospects for
the second half looked encouraging, the directors claimed.
Orders received in the period increased by Pounds 1m to Pounds 4.7m. Sales
were up 20 per cent to Pounds 4.2m, with the UK ahead 12 per cent and Europe
28 per cent.
Gearing remained 'unacceptably high' at 98 per cent, but a number of cash
raising measures had recently been taken.
Losses per share in the half year were 0.1p (2.8p).
