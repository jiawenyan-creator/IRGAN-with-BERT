  [Excerpt] It is still not known how long Gorazde will live. 
Is it a question of minutes or hours. It is certainly not a 
question of days, as chetnik tank have already entered the town. 
The chaos has begun; horror and hell are in every place [words 
indistinct]. Chetniks are shooting at the people with snipers 
and anti-aircraft weapons. There are many casualties but their 
number is not known in this chaos. Unarmed people are facing 
chetnik tanks. NATO planes are agonizing [words indistinct]. 
The town center of Gorazde has become a real enclosure for 
children, women, and the elderly waiting for the death they have 
already seen. [passage omitted]
