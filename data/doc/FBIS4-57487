  [Text] Santo Domingo, 19 May (DPA) -- This morning, the 
Central Electoral Board (JCE) began reviewing the figures issued 
in official bulletins on the results of Monday's elections, thus 
responding to accusations by the opposition Dominican 
Revolutionary Party (PRD), which said the figures are fraudulent. 
  The review is the result of a resolution issued last night 
by 
the JCE, which instructed the director of its vote-counting 
center to work with technicians appointed by the parties and the 
JCE advisers to review the released figures. 
  The PRD maintains that the numbers cited in JCE bulletins 
differ from those issued to the parties in diskettes that 
supposedly contain the same information. 
  The JCE vote-counting director admitted the discrepancy but 
explained that it is because the diskettes given to the parties 
do not always contain all the information released in the 
bulletins. 
  The method of review to be used by the JCE technicians and 
the parties has not been revealed.
