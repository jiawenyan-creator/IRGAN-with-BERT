FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: O&amp;Y launches Pounds 215m property trust
OLYMPIA &amp; York, the Canadian property company, yesterday launched an
enterprise zone property trust aimed at raising Pounds 215m from small
investors to finance a building in London's Canary Wharf development.
O&amp;Y accepts that the deal, the biggest of its kind yet attempted,
effectively offers it a '10-year interest-free mortgage'. However, Mr Robert
John, executive director, denied the deal was a change of course, or that it
indicated O&amp;Y was short of cash.
The company has shelved this project until now because it wanted to wait
until a completed development was in place, making it easier to attract
investors.
New concessions by the Inland Revenue in December last year - particularly a
measure granting enterprise zone relief for buildings up to two years after
they had been occupied - also made the deal easier.
A completed building at 10 Cabot Square, with more than 600,000 sq ft of
office space, will be sold by O&amp;Y to the Cabot Square Trust.
The trust will then be divided into Pounds 1,000 units, which will be sold
to investors, with a minimum investment of Pounds 5,000.
Cabot Square is more than double the size of the previous largest enterprise
zone trust, and will be marketed as a tax shelter.
Investment in enterprise zone property qualifies for full top-rate tax
relief. The trust is open for investment until March 30, when it will be
officially formed.
O&amp;Y will buy any unsold units, although it has the flexibility to continue
selling units in the trust for another two years.
Investors have a put option to sell a long lease in the building back to O&amp;Y
after 10 years, for exactly the same price paid for it.
The company's ability to pay this has been secured by Morgan Guaranty, the
US investment bank.
