FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: US operations help lift Telemetrix 64% to
Pounds 16m
A particularly strong performance in the US helped Telemetrix, the supplier
of specialised electronic components, test equipment and services for the
telecommunications and networking industries, to report a 64 per cent
profits increase in 1993.
Pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 9.85m to Pounds 16.1m on turnover ahead
by 23 per cent to Pounds 123.3m (Pounds 100.6m).
Earnings per share increased by 70 per cent to 8.5p (5p), partly reflecting
a lower tax charge and minority interest.
The annual dividend is being raised to 1p (0.8p), and the shares closed up
8p at 137p.
After a Pounds 182,000 (Pounds 356,000) loss on discontinued operations,
operating profits grew by 55.5 per cent to Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 10.3m),
representing an improvement in operating margins to 13 per cent against 10
per cent.
Overall the group generated Pounds 6.68m (Pounds 2.46m) of profits in the US
on sales markedly up at Pounds 86.5m (Pounds 60.9m). Sales to the Asia
Pacific region also grew strongly, while UK turnover was little changed at
Pounds 31.2m.
GTI, the group's 58 per cent owned US subsidiary which is also quoted on
Nasdaq, increased operating profits by 57 per cent to Pounds 12.9m on sales
up 40 per cent to Pounds 85.5m.
The improved margin - up from 13 per cent to 15 per cent - came from
increased volumes of Valor networking products. However, Mr Tim Curtis,
chief executive, cautioned that beginning in the second half, Valor sales
and profits had been hit by customer inventory corrections and competitive
pricing pressures.
Zetex, the group's UK-based specialist semi-conductor manufacturer, reported
broadly unchanged operating profits at Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 2.19m) on sales
up by 23 per cent to Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 15.9m).
Trend, the UK-based manufacturer of telecommunications test equipment,
increased its operating profit by 18 per cent to Pounds 1.3m, although
turnover fell from Pounds 16.7m to Pounds 13.7m, reflecting the run-down of
the defence activities.
The group's strong cash flow enabled it to eliminate debt and end the year
with cash balances of Pounds 11.3m.
COMMENT
The 1994 first half is likely to be tough for Telemetrix, but the group is
well positioned as a quality supplier to the high growth data communications
and telecommunications equipment markets. Re-engineering established
products and new automated production facilities should help GTI restore
gross margins later in the year, when the US company should also benefit
from volume shipments of products based on new Fast Ethernet standards.
Investments in additional capacity are already helping margins at Zetex.
Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 18.5m are expected this year, producing
earnings of 9.8p. The shares are trading on a forward multiple of 14.2 and
could go higher.
