Take notice that on January 21, 1994, Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company, tendered for filing proposed changes in its
FPC Electric Service Tariff No. 1. The proposed changes would increase revenues from jurisdictional sales and service

Maine Yankee seeks approval of the proposed increase in order to incorporate in its formula rate the revised estimates
of its future decommissioning costs. Maine Yankee also submits with its filing an executed Offer of Partial Settlement
on its decommissioning costs and fund collection rate and return on common equity for June 14, 1993, and a continuation
of the 10.65% ROE beyond June 14, 1993.
Maine Yankee also is making a compliance filing for amounts to fund post-retirement benefits other than pensions
(PBOPs) pursuant to the requirement of SFAS 106. This compliance filing is not included in the Offer of Partial Settlement.
Copies of the filing were served upon Maine Yankee's jurisdictional customers, secondary customers, and Massachusetts
Department of Public Utilities, Vermont Public Service Board, Connecticut Public Utilities Control Authority,
Maine Public Utilities Commission, New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission and Office of the Public Advocate,
