CABLE TV PUTS PROFIT AHEAD OF FANS' WELFARE 
I am boiling mad that Laker fans were denied the pleasure of watching earlier 
playoff games because they were broadcast on cable television. 
Those of us in the noncable world think of this as a crisis and don't like 
being shut out. 
Isn't there anything we can do about this? Is the world so commercial that our 
sports can be enjoyed only by those who contribute to that commercialism?
