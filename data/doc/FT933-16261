FT  05 JUL 93 / Willis questions pit reprieves
AS MANY as six of the 12 pits reprieved by the government are soon to close,
Mr Norman Willis, general-secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said
yesterday.
On the eve of today's Commons debate on coal Mr Willis used a letter to Mr
John Major to predict that over the next 18 months 38 pits would close.
The letter came as National Power, the largest electricity generator,
confirmed it would not consider additional coal purchases until the autumn.
