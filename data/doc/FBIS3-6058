  [Text] It has been learned that the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] will decide this week whether it will 
convene a special Board of Governors meeting to intensively 
discuss the North Korean nuclear issue after hearing the precise 
report of the inspection team's activities in North Korea. 
  North Korea did not allow the inspection team to immediately 
confirm whether some seals, which are the core target of the 
current inspection, were broken or not. Thus, North Korea 
restricted the team's inspection activities. The IAEA regards 
this as an act of breaking the agreement. 
  Accordingly, the IAEA inspection team was going to leave 
earlier than the originally scheduled period of two weeks. 
However, the inspection team abandoned the early departure idea 
in consideration of China's reaction. 
  The IAEA inspection team is going to leave Pyongyang around 
15 March after completing its inspection activities.
