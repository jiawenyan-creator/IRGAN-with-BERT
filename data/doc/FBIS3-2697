  [Text] Suzhou, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Singapore financial 
groups have streamed into Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, to invest 
since China and Singapore joined hands to build an industrial 
park there in May last year. 
  Suzhou, an ancient garden city, has developed into an 
economically-booming city in east China. 
  At present, Singapore companies have concluded letters of 
intent and agreements on more than 50 contracts on cooperative 
projects with the Suzhou city government. 
  With a sum of three billion U.S. dollars, these projects 
involve the fields of tourism, energy development, 
transportation, electronics, machinery, textiles, chemicals and 
the service trade. 
  A local official noted that banking and economic entities 
from the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Britain and 
Austria and Taiwan have contacted the Singaporean government to 
express their wishes to participate in the development of the 
industrial park.
