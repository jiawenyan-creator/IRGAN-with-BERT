WORLD; 
FRENCH SHIPS GATHER OFF LEBANON 
Syria's militia allies said today that a French flotilla assembling near 
Lebanon was "an act of aggression" and that they will shell any warships that 
approached the coast. 
Syria has computerized radar capable of detecting ships and providing target 
data for long-range artillery, but the militias do not.
