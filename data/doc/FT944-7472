FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: McKechnie makes ADollars 15m purchase
McKechnie, the plastics and metal components group, yesterday started to
make good its promise of more acquisitions, with the ADollars 15.4m (Pounds
7.48m) purchase of the packaged products division of Hunter Douglas, the
Australian group.
The division distributes drapery hardware like blinds and curtain rails,
thus fitting in with Phipps International, an earlier Australian
acquisition. The two companies should be able to feed business back to
McKechnie's aluminium extrusion operations.
This latest purchase brings to Pounds 51m the commitments McKechnie has made
on takeovers since August last year. Its spending has been partially offset
by Pounds 21.7m from disposals.
Last month McKechnie said it would buy companies in Europe, North America
and the Pacific area.
