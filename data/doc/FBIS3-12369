  [Text] Prime Minister Khaleda Zia has strongly condemned 
Friday's massacre of 52 Palestinians [words indistinct] in a 
mosque in Hebron in the occupied West Bank. In a statement 
yesterday, the prime minister expressed her apprehension that 
the (?diabolic) carnage by the Jewish settlers could make the 
Middle East peace process more complex. She said the world 
community is now required to be more active and alert so that 
the Middle East peace process is not jeopardized. The prime 
minister reiterated solidarity of the people of Bangladesh for 
the Palestinians. 
  Leader of the opposition and Awami League chief, Sheikh 
Hasina, in a statement expressed deep shock at the killing.
