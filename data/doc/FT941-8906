FT  17 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy
When economic statistics are dribbled into the market day by day, the result
is often sharp lurches in mood. When they seem to come all at once, it is
more likely to be be bewilderment - unless like yesterday they mostly seem
to point in the same general direction. The increase in unemployment may
have been a blip, but both manufacturing employment and vacancies are down.
Taken together with lacklustre retail sales and Tuesday's disappointing
figures on industrial output, the picture emerges of an economy whose
recovery has slowed since November's budget.
That need not be a signal for alarm but it does make another base rate cut
more likely before April's tax increases start to bite. At least the
inflation news is good on both the wholesale and retail price fronts. There
are some signs that pay settlements are starting to creep up, but December's
quickening in unit labour costs mostly reflects the fall in production
during that month. The equity market's 54-point rally since Monday night
reflects new hopes for lower interest rates. But the same data which are
encouraging such optimistic thinking suggest earnings may be insufficient to
support share prices if the cuts do not arrive.
