METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 125 POUNDS OF FRUIT A DAY CONFISCATED AT 
AIRPORT 
Federal agriculture inspectors stationed since last week at Burbank Airport 
have been confiscating an average of 125 pounds of fruit per day in the effort 
to prevent the Mediterranean fruit fly outbreak from spreading beyond Los 
Angeles. 
"It's more than I expected," said Scott Sanner, one of six U.S. Department of 
Agriculture plant protection and quarantine officers assigned to the airport 
since Tuesday. "I know the airlines are surprised." 
The uniformed officers are stationed at the airport's two security checkpoints 
and monitor X-ray screens for fruit. Fruit found in carry-on luggage is taken 
to the department's El Monte office for inspection.
