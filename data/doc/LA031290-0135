ZSA ZSA'S DELTA SUIT ON HOLD 
Zsa Zsa Gabor, who sued Delta Air Lines for $10 million after she was ejected 
from a flight for letting her dogs roam free, has had her lawsuit tossed out of 
court for the moment, a federal judge said. 
U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said Gabor's attorneys can refile the 
complaint once they fix its flaws. 
Gabor sued alleging negligence, defamation and assault and battery after she 
was removed from Flight 462 while stopping in Atlanta en route from Los Angeles 
to West Palm Beach on Jan. 6, 1989. 
A flight attendant and the pilot asked their first-class passenger to put her 
dogs Genghis Kahn and Macho Man in her carry-on kennel, but she refused. "You 
know Zsa Zsa. She'll speak her mind," said her lawyer, Donald Norton. "She told 
the stewardess what she thought of her." 
In Atlanta, a Delta vice president boarded the Boeing 767 to ask again, but the 
airline said she rejected the requests with "considerable vulgarity" and was 
escorted off the flight by a police officer.
