ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; 
SUSPECT IN OHIO ROBBERY ARRESTED 
An Ohio man suspected of armed robbery and kidnaping has been arrested after 
more than 10 months as a fugitive, federal authorities said Tuesday. 
Gregory Waller III, 23, of Niles, Ohio, was taken into custody without incident 
Monday at a home in Garden Grove, FBI spokesman Wylie B. Cox said. 
Waller has been accused of holding up an Ohio jewelry store at gunpoint on Oct. 
27, 1989, Cox said. Waller, who police say was shot by the store's owner, was 
charged with kidnaping because he allegedly held the store's customers hostage, 
Cox said. He was arrested shortly after the robbery. 
Waller failed to appear for a court hearing in February, Cox said. A few months 
later, federal authorities obtained a warrant charging him with unlawful flight 
to avoid prosecution, he said. 
Cox said Waller was arrested Monday after "information was developed that he 
was in Orange County." He declined to elaborate. 
Waller, who had been working in Orange County as a painter and was staying at a 
rented room at 14161 Grand Meadows, is expected to be extradited to Ohio, Cox 
said.
