FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Irish Life reorganises into two
new units
Irish Life has reorganised its UK and Irish operations into two new units.
The retail businesses in Ireland and the UK are to be combined into one
unit, while the Irish corporate business will be combined with the
investment division into a second unit.
Previously, the Irish retail and corporate businesses operated as one unit
while the UK retail business formed part of the European operations.
Mr Brian Duncan, chief executive of Irish Life Ireland, is to step down at
the end of the year following the reorganisation.
Mr Duncan has worked for Irish Life since 1964, heading the Irish operation
since 1985. He is now expected to take up a position in the Irish health
insurance industry, being tipped to take over at VHI, the state-owned health
insurance company.
The reorganisation is 'designed to build upon the company's leadership
position in our core retail and corporate business markets in Ireland and to
underpin our strategic repositioning in the UK market,' explained Mr David
Kingston, managing director.
