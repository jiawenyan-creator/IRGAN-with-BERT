FT  02 JUL 93 / Technology: Winning the war on refrigerator CFCs - Worth
Watching
Domestic appliance manufacturer Whirlpool has beaten other US manufacturers
in the Dollars 30m winner-take-all competition to try to develop and produce
chlorofluorocarbon-free super-efficient refrigerators.
The prize money will help keep down the cost to the consumer of the new
refrigerators when they are marketed in the US from next year.
Whirlpool fought the use of CFCs on two fronts. First, the ozone-depleting
coolant has been replaced by HFC-134a; second, the chemical used to expand
the foam insulation is to be replaced by HCFC-141b. This contains some CFCs,
but will be replaced once a suitable alternative has been found. Whirlpool:
US, 616 923 5000.
