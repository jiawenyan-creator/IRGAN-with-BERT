  [Text] The Socialist Party of Labor [PSM] is not involved 
in the current government reshuffle, which was fully carried out 
by the ruling party, PSM Vice President Tudor Mohora said at a 
news conference held in Bucharest today. We consider this 
reshuffle to be a measure taken in accordance with 
constitutional standards. This is not only the result of the 
choice of the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], but also 
of the pressure applied by the parties of the parliamentary 
coalition, including the PSM, which demanded that urgent steps 
should be taken to improve the overall governmental activity. 
We will only support this government if concrete steps are 
taken to implement a coherent governmental program, Mr. Mohora 
said. 
  In connection with the elections in the Republic of Moldova, 
Senator Adrian Paunescu [PSM vice president] said: We must 
examine the newly created situation with lucidity and realism. 
In this respect, he pointed out that, quote, we are also to be 
partly blamed for this situation because of our inability to 
unite on major issues; therefore, it is necessary to work out a 
sole national strategy, which goes beyond party interests, Mr. 
Paunescu said. 
  In another order of ideas, the participants in today's news 
conference told the journalists that a PSM delegation 
participated as guests in the 25-27 February Congress of the 
Socialist Party of the Working People of Russia. On that 
occasion the delegation also participated in a roundtable on the 
following subject: The Socialist Idea Yesterday, Today, and 
Tomorrow.
