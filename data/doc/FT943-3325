FT  14 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: TSE closes higher after election
In spite of a bad day for gold stocks, the TSE 300 closed higher as
investors shrugged off the election of a separatist government in Quebec and
sought solace in a stronger Canadian dollar, a rally in the bond market and
perceived good news on the US inflation front. But falls led rises by 377 to
350 after volume of 57.2m shares. The TSE 300 gained 14.35 at 4,344.22. The
dollar was sent to a seven-month high by the stronger than expected showing
of the defeated Liberal party in the Quebec elections, indicating that
popular support for separation was not overwhelming.
