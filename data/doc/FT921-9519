FT  12 FEB 92 / Euro Disney tries to end dispute with contractors
EURO DISNEY is trying to defuse an acrimonious row with its contractors by
agreeing terms for a settlement with a group of companies which worked on
the construction of its theme park outside Paris.
Euro Disney, which plans to open Euro Disneyland at Marne La Vallee on April
12, has been beset by a storm of complaints from disgruntled building
companies claiming it has been too slow in paying their bills.
Yesterday Euro Disney announced it had reached an agreement with a group of
40 companies, all of which had worked on the park as sub-contractors of
Gabo/Eremco, a company contracted directly by Euro Disney.
The 40 sub-contractors should have been paid by Gabo from the FFr110m
(Dollars 20.3m) it received from Euro Disney. However Euro Disney said it
had been forced to dismiss Gabo for 'mismanaging' the project and that Gabo
subsequently filed for bankruptcy. As a result the sub-contractors were not
paid.
This has left some in a fragile state. Euro Disney has agreed to make a
special payment to them so they can pay essential bills to avoid having to
file for bankruptcy.
