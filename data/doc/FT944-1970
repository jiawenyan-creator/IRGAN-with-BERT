FT  17 DEC 94 / Bruton keeps Adams meeting brief
The first meeting between Mr John Bruton, the Irish republic's new prime
minister, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, was little more than
a handshake yesterday as the prime minister decided to delay formal
negotiations with Sinn Fein until next week.
The prime minister faces a punishing schedule in appointing his
administration. Nonetheless his apparent coolness towards Mr Adams is seen
as a shift of emphasis in Dublin's relations with the republicans.
The first meeting was expected to take place on the margins of yesterday's
session of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in Dublin. But Mr Bruton
made only a brief appearance. Sinn Fein said nothing substantive was
discussed, although the sides agreed to meet soon.
Mr Bruton's election could mark an important change in the republic's policy
on Northern Ireland. His appointment was broadly welcomed by hardline
unionists in the north. Mr Bruton's views on Ulster have been much more
sympathetic to the unionist point of view than that of other southern
politicians.
Mr Bruton is 'absolutely committed' to continuing the forum, although he has
been critical of its ill-defined role under the outgoing administration.
Mr Bruton spoke to Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, by telephone
yesterday. An Irish government official said the two leaders might meet as
early as next week, probably in London.
