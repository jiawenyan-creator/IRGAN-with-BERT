  [Text] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Iranian Ambassador in Beirut 
Homayun 'Alizadeh has criticized the "suspect media campaigns 
against the Islamic Republic, exaggeration of small matters, and 
attempts to cast doubt on the Iranian economy." 
  Addressing a speech rally held in Beirut yesterday to mark 
the anniversary of the victory of the Islamic revolution in 
Iran, he referred to "imperialist moves to undermine the 
nation's steadfastness and force it to follow a new plan 
intended for the region." 
  He enumerated "the Islamic Republic's achievements," noting 
that "it was able to increase the local product by 7.7 percent, 
while the average local product increase last year did not 
exceed 2 percent." He pointed out that the aim of "the 
imperialist campaign is to undermine Iran's stability and 
security through groups linked to it." 
  Shaykh Na'im Qasim, Hizballah's deputy secretary general, 
spoke on the occasion and attacked the Lebanese Government, 
saying "we have seen nothing from it except harm to its people 
and to all Lebanon." He spoke of "the government's suppression 
of the press and the media because they talk about the head of 
that government or some of its members."
