FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Istituto Mobiliare Italiano
The 335,000 private investors who bought shares in the recently privatised
Istituto Mobiliare Italiano (IMI) will receive a L400 dividend for 1993,
writes John Simkins in Milan.
This effectively doubles the previous year's dividend and represents a
policy switch by IMI to a more generous allocation. A dividend of L2,000 was
paid in 1992 on each of the then 60m shares which were increased to 600m
before the public offer.
The total payout has increased from L120bn to L240bn (Dollars 147m).
