FT  08 FEB 94 / Public work totalling Pounds 1.1bn put out to tender
The government has put more than Pounds 1.1bn of civil service work out to
tender in the first round of its market-testing programme, Mr William
Waldegrave, public service minister, said yesterday.
The total represents almost three-quarters of the Pounds 1.5bn target set
for the first round which was due to have been completed in September. The
programme was delayed by uncertainties over the employment rights of staff
whose jobs are contracted out to the private sector.
Speaking at a Financial Times conference in London on resource management in
the public sector, Mr Waldegrave said about a third of the reviews had led
to improvements in quality of service. Quality had at least been maintained
in the others.
The programme was on course to produce savings of about 25 per cent of
running costs, he added.
Mr Waldegrave welcomed what he described as a growing partnership between
the public and private sectors in providing public services. He said more
than Pounds 2bn had been saved since 1979 as a result of efficiency drives.
He stressed, however, the importance of maintaining standards of probity and
care with public money. A recent report from the Commons public accounts
committee warned that such standards appeared to be slipping as a result of
management reforms in the public services.
'What we are aiming to do is to combine high standards of public conduct
with higher standards of service efficiency,' he said.
Mr Tony Baldry, the local government minister, said he was prepared to see
local authorities tendering for contracts in neighbouring authorities.
He said that rules against such tendering had been devised when local
government had been hostile to compulsory competitive tendering. The rules
might be relaxed as local authorities showed themselves less resistant. 'I
don't have a closed mind about new unitary authorities contracting to supply
services to each other,' he said.
