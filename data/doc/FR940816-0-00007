<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a supplemental
new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Pfizer, Inc. The supplement provides for revised tolerances for residues
of dihydrostreptomycin in edible animal tissues.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pfizer, Inc., 235 East 42d St., New York, NY 10017, filed supplemental NADA 65483 that provides for revising
tolerances for residues of dihydrostreptomycin in uncooked, edible tissues of cattle and swine, in milk from dairy
animals, and in any food in which such milk is used. A zero tolerance level was established when the drug was originally
approved on February 18, 1954. A zero tolerance affirmed that no detectable residues of the new animal drug were permissible
in edible tissues of treated animals when the tissues were assayed using available analytical methods.


As analytical technology improved, advanced methods were developed that were more sensitive and capable of measuring
progressively smaller amounts of residues in tissues. FDA adopted the concept of maximum negligible residues to
reflect the lower level of quantitative sensitivity of the official regulatory analytical method. This concept
was later modified to consider the consumption levels of various edible tissues.
In addition, dihydrostreptomycin has been approved for use in several injectable and intramammary products used
for treating bovine, porcine, equine, and canine species. Where tolerances for use in food animals would have been
appropriate, those tolerances were not established because of the existing zero level. At this time, tolerances
for residues in those species are established.
FDA has determined that a revision of the tolerance from zero to 0.125 parts per million (ppm) in milk, and 2.0 ppm in
kidney and 0.5 ppm in all other tissues of cattle and swine is appropriate. The new tolerance reflects the levels that
would have been established when the drug was originally approved if the analytical methods had been more sensitive.
No new toxicity data were submitted. Levels of 2.0 ppm in kidney, 0.5 ppm in all other edible tissues, and 0.125 ppm in
milk reflect the levels that FDA considers to be safe and the residue levels that the U.S. Department of Agriculture
has been monitoring for a number of years.
The supplement is approved as of July 20, 1994, and the regulations in 21 CFR 556.200 are amended to reflect the new tolerance
levels.
The approval of this supplement did not require the submission of new data and information. Therefore, a freedom of
information summary under 21 CFR part 20 and 21 CFR 514.11(e)(2) was not required. Approval of the supplement is based
on the information submitted with the original NADA.
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(9) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.



List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 556


Animal drugs, Foods.
Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food
and Drugs and redelegated to the Center for Veterinary Medicine, 21 CFR part 556 is amended as follows:


PART 556_TOLERANCES FOR RESIDUES OF NEW ANIMAL DRUGS IN FOOD


1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 556 continues to read as follows:

 



Authority: 

Secs. 402, 512, 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 342, 360b, 371).



2. Section 556.200 is revised to read as follows:


556.200 

Dihydrostreptomycin.


Tolerances are established for residues of dihydrostreptomycin in uncooked, edible tissues of cattle and swine
of 2.0 parts per million (ppm) in kidney and 0.5 ppm in other tissues, and 0.125 ppm in milk.
