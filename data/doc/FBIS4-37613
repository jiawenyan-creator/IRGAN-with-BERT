  [Text] Foreign Minister Peres says that Israel has 
conveyed several interesting proposals to Syria, and if they are 
accepted, a breakthrough will ensue. Minister Peres did not 
specify the content of the proposals, although he noted that 
they focused on the need to conduct negotiations in three 
interlinked and interdependent spheres: peace, security, and 
border pullback. 
  As for negotiating venues, Minister Peres does not think 
substantive negotiations can be held on what he termed the 
narrow path of the Washington talks. 
  He further said the negotiations should be opened up to 
high-ranking levels to the extent possible, and that they should 
be conducted away from the public eye. 
  Replying to our correspondent Ya'el Ayalon's question, the 
foreign minister said that Yasir 'Arafat has not submitted a 
request to visit Jerusalem so far, and for that reason, no date 
for his arrival has been set.
