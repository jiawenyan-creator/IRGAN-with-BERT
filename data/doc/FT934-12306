FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Monarch Resources placing raises Pounds 3m
SHARES IN Monarch Resources fell 8p to 159p after the London-quoted gold
company with operations in Venezuela announced a placing of 2m new shares to
raise Pounds 3m net and a slight increase in interim pre-tax losses from
Dollars 1.87m to Dollars 1.93m (Pounds 1.27m).
Mr Michael Beckett, chairman, said the losses for the six months to June 30,
equivalent to 0.13 cents (0.128 cents) a share, were attributable to the
Revemin plant, which recorded losses of Dollars 473,000 (Dollars 437,000)
and to 'somewhat higher overhead costs'.
Turnover was Dollars 3.2m (Dollars 3.93m).
The share placing gives Monarch more flexibility to continue its heavy
exploration programme while working on the La Camorra gold mine project.
Carl von Rohrer, a Munich-based fund management group which was also a
sub-underwriter of Monarch's Pounds 19m rights issue in June 1992, is
subscribing for the new shares at 116 1/2 p each.
Mr Beckett said the shares represented about 4.5 per cent of the enlarged
capital but would be spread through various funds.
In spite of unexpected water problems during recent development work, La
Camorra was on budget and on schedule to start operations in June 1994. Mr
Beckett recalled that La Camorra was expected to be one of the world's
lowest-cost gold mines with cash costs of about Dollars 115 a troy ounce.
Mr Anthony Ciali, president, said Revemin's performance had improved
compared with the second half of 1992 when it recorded a Dollars 1.41m loss.
Drilling at the Canaima concession had resulted in indicated resources of
163,000 ounces of gold with 69,000 ounces in the 'inferred resource'
category.
