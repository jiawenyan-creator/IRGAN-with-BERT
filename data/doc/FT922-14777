FT  04 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family Nikkei slumps again  - At a glance
1992 has so far been a dreadful year for Japanese equities, as the fall in
the Nikkei-Dow index shows. The Bank of Japan cut the base rate by 0.75 per
cent to 3.75 per cent as part of a package of measures to stimulate the
economy this week, but the market responded by falling further.
During the week, the Nikkei hits its lowest level since early 1987.
Marketeers had treated the Bank's move with scepticism, and technical
factors had also helped the fall. However, many analysts are now confident
that the market should bottom out by June. Price/earnings ratios are now
much lower than they were at the height at the height of the boom.
