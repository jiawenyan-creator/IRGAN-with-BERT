  [Text] Military technical cooperation between Russia and 
India is continuing. This year the Indian budget envisages an 
increase of 20 percent in this area. Many link this fact with 
the purchase of Russian tanks. The question of whether India 
will actually purchase tanks from Russia or build them using our 
technology was discussed at a news conference at the Russian 
Ministry of Defense held by Vladimir Semenov, commander of the 
ground forces, as part of a return visit of his Indian 
colleague, Mr. Joshi. [Video shows Colonel Semenov and Joshi 
addressing news conference] 
  The main details pertaining to the signing of the 
Russian-Indian documents will be discussed at the level of the 
ministers of defense of the two countries, but it can already be 
said today that India will become a reliable partner in the 
sphere of exports of Russian military equipment and weapons. 
[Video shows Semenov speaking to camera] 
  [Begin Semenov recording] We have been linked over the past 
34 years by friendly relations in the sphere of military 
technical cooperation. In its time the Soviet Union did much to 
maintain India's defense capability at the proper level. But in 
recent years, the past three or four years, our mutual relations 
have weakened somewhat. The main aim of my visit to India and I 
think the reason for General Joshi's visit to Russia is to 
elevate mutual relations between the Russian Army and the Indian 
Army to a qualitatively new level. [end recording]
