RECORD RACK: *** 1/2 DESERT ROSE BAND "PAGES OF LIFE" CURB/MCA: ALBUMS ARE 
RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC). 
Is there a better country-rock band around today than Chris Hillman's? When you 
listen to the group's sure-footed third album, it's hard to think of any. As 
the title suggests, there is plenty of meaty material here. 
Fortunately, it is pages of life, not the whole book, that the band addresses, 
and by keeping the focus tight, the album succeeds in tackling big issues in 
modest ways. Desert Rose supplies solace in both affirming word and uplifting 
music. Many of the songs spring from an understated foundation of Christian 
faith and underscore in various ways what may be the toughest problem facing 
the last decade of the 20th Century: hopelessness. "Darkness on the 
Playground," the album's gripping centerpiece, finds "There's trouble on the 
streets in this land of the free / Freedom has a price and you know it don't 
come cheap." The cure for such troubles, however, comes not from flight -- 
whether to an otherworldly spiritual nirvana or into drugs or even fame -- but 
by facing life's travails squarely and gaining the strength that comes only 
through such challenges. RANDY LEWIS
