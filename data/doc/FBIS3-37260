  [Text] London ("AZG" daily), 11/02/94--"The war which is 
now carried between the Mountainous Karabakh and Azerbaijan may 
possibly grow soon into a war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, 
the president of the Republic of Armenia declared today during 
the meeting with journalists in the Carlton hotel of London. 
This was probably the first time when the RA [Republic of 
Armenia] president officially declared that Armenia will 
interfere with the Karabakh conflict if a danger of genocide or 
moving the population of Karabakh appears. In this case, Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan stressed, Armenia will participate in the conflict 
no regard who will be in power by that time. This will depend 
on the will of the people. Our people will not allow a new 
genocide", the president noted.
