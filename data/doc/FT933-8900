FT  13 AUG 93 / German forex reserves rise by DM39.3bn
GERMANY'S foreign exchange reserves rose by DM39.3bn (Pounds 15.5bn) in the
last week of July as a result of the currency turbulence preceding the
decision to widen currency bands in the European exchange rate mechanism and
thus avert speculative pressures.
The Bundesbank said in its weekly statement that the reserve total was now
DM157.9bn.
The sharp rise, caused by Bundesbank intervention to support ERM currrencies
under pressure - predominantly the French franc - only showed up in the
figures for the week to August 7 because foreign exchange transactions are
reported with a week's delay.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, has said some DM60bn flowed
into Germany in July as a result of intervention in the ERM.
To offset the impact on money supply growth and inflation, it cut sharply
the weekly allocation of securities repurchase agreements (repos) in the
first week of August.
The rise in Bundesbank foreign exchange reserves the previous week was
DM7.7bn, also reflecting ERM intervention.
