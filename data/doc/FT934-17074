FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: A guide to leasehold changes - At a
Glance
THE Department of the Environment has published a booklet on the new system
of leasehold enfranchisement, which comes into effect on November 1. Owners
of long leaseholds on flats will have the right collectively to buy the
freehold of their building, or individually to extend their leases, if they
and their flats meet certain conditions. The booklet, 'Leasehold Flats',
guides leaseholders through the regulations and procedures involved, and is
available free from the department on 071-276-0900.
