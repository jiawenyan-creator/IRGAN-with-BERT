FT  18 SEP 92 / Letter: Sound theory, but maybe impossible in practice
Sir, Barry Riley's argument (The Long View, September 12) that pension fund
trustees and their portfolio managers should take into account changes in
investment fundamentals - ie, make major market timing decisions and asset
allocation shifts - deserves further scrutiny. Although in theory it seems
to be a sound argument, in practice, it appears to be extremely difficult,
if not impossible, to implement.
Based on our experience, gained through monitoring a large number of fund
managers, we have not yet had conclusive evidence that adding value on a
consistent basis through market timing - ie, making significant shifts
between asset classes in anticipation of extreme price movements - can be
achieved. Given this environment, it would require only a few poor decisions
to deflate longer results to the point where real rates of return would fail
to have been achieved and the trustees would be unable to meet their real
liabilities.
Pension fund trustees and their portfolio managers can afford the
longer-term perspective. So it would be more appropriate to gauge the risk
acceptable to their specific requirements, formulate an asset allocation
policy which is consistent with these criteria and adhere to it, even when
the stock market is at its ugliest. This does not mean pension fund trustees
or their managers should necessarily follow the crowd. Instead they should
devote more effort to addressing their specific liability structure. I would
be surprised if their individual characteristics would mirror the current
consensus and this is why the copy-cat mentality is so dangerous.
