  [Text] Prague, Jan. 12 -- Following his talks with the 
leaders of the Visegrad Four, President Clinton confirmed that 
the security of Eastern European states "is important to the 
security of the United States", and that at present the problem 
does not revolve around the issue of whether these states will 
be accepted by NATO, but when and how. Clinton, however, did 
not make any new proposals going beyond the framework of the 
"Partnership for Peace", and did not make any concrete offers to 
the group. 
  President Lech Walesa summed up the American proposal saying 
that "sometimes small is beautiful and we believe, this is a 
step in the right direction." 
  President of the Czech Republic Vaclav Havel emphasised that 
the "Partnership for Peace" programme cannot be a substitute for 
full membership of NATO for the states involved. Havel added 
that the Visegrad countries regard membership in the 
"partnership" as the first step on the road to full NATO 
membership. 
  Havel made it clear that the Czech Republic has no interest 
in trying to isolate Russia, but it can make sovereign decisions 
concerning its alliances.
