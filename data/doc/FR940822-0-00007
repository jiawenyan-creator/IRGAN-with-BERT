Airworthiness Directives; Teledyne Continental Motors (Formerly Bendix) S20, S200, S600,
and S1200 Series Magnetos

ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment revises an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM)
(formerly Bendix) S20, S200, S600, and S1200 series magnetos, that currently requires
replacing Bendix ignition coils and rotating magnets, regardless of total time in service (TIS), with improved TCM
ignition coils, rotating magnets and marking magnetos to indicate compliance with this AD, except for the S1200
series magnetos on which the AD requires replacing only the ignition coils as that series magneto already incorporates
rotating magnets with the improved TCM design. This amendment limits the number of magnetos requiring replacement.
This amendment is prompted by a report from the manufacturer that there is an error in the serial number listing of affected
magnetos. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent magneto failure and subsequent engine failure.

 Effective September 6, 1994. 


The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the
Federal Register as of September 6, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On December 29, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 940103,
Amendment 398785 (59 FR 4555, February 1, 1994), to require replacing certain Bendix ignition coils and rotating
magnets, regardless of time in service (TIS), with improved serviceable Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) ignition
coils and rotating magnets at either the next 100-hour inspection, the next annual inspection, the next progressive
inspection, or the next 100 hours TIS after the effective date of the AD, whichever occurs first. For S1200 series
magnetos, the AD requires replacing only the ignition coils as the rotating magnets on that series magneto already
incorporates the improved TCM design. Additionally, the AD requires remarking magnetos to indicate compliance
with the AD. That action was prompted by recent reports of accidents caused by failures of magnetos incorporating
older Bendix components that had not been replaced in accordance with superseded AD 730704, Amendment
391731 (38 FR 27600, October 5, 1973). That condition, if not corrected, could result in magneto failure and
subsequent engine failure. 


Since the issuance of that AD, TCM has informed the FAA that an error in the serial number listing in TCM Service Bulletin
(SB) No. 637, dated December 1992, resulted in too many affected magnetos requiring AD compliance. The AD should apply
only to certain magnetos manufactured by Bendix in Sidney, New York, and not to any Bendix magnetos built in either
Jacksonville, Florida, or Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, the S600 series magnetos require replacement of
only the rotating magnets and not the ignition coils. Finally, the FAA received reports that there is some confusion
as to how the S20, S200, S600, and S1200 series magnetos are referenced in the TCM SB and
the AD. TCM has issued a revised SB that corrects these errors. 

The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of TCM Mandatory Service Bulletin (MSB) No. MSB644, dated
April 4, 1994, that describes procedures for replacing certain Bendix ignition coils and rotating magnets with improved
serviceable TCM ignition coils and rotating magnets and marking magnetos to indicate compliance with this MSB.
