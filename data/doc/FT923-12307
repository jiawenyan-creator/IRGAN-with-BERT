FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: Grosvenor raising Pounds 25m for
new fund
Grosvenor Venture Managers, one of the most active independent venture and
development capital management groups, is raising subscriptions for the
Fifth Grosvenor Fund. It intends to raise more than Pounds 25m for the new
fund.
The fund will take the form of a UK limited partnership, which GVM has used
successfully in the past. Investors are likely to be big UK pension funds,
insurance companies and overseas institutions.
One of the limited partners will be an exempt unauthorised unit trust for
those funds unable to invest directly in a partnership.
