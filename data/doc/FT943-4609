FT  08 SEP 94 / Teesside offshore yard to be closed
Trafalgar House Offshore Holdings yesterday said that one of its two
Teesside yards is to close, Chris Tighe writes.
The group said the closures were part of a restructuring prompted by the
much-reduced market for large offshore modules as the North Sea oil industry
moved to subsea and floating production systems.
The Middlesbrough yard at Linthorpe Dinsdale, known as Redpath Offshore, is
empty but once employed more than 500.
Mr Syd Fudge, managing director of the group, said its other yards, at Port
Clarence on the Tees and Methil, Fife, would remain open and continue
operating normally.
Methil has work until mid-1995 and Port Clarence to 1996. The company is
pursuing orders for both.
