FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: France abandons plan to sell off
radio group
The French government yesterday abandoned plans to privatise RMC, the
state-controlled radio group, after deciding that none of the bids for was
high enough.
RMC, which owns a number of radio stations including Radio Monte Carlo for
easy listening music and Radio Nostalgie for golden oldies, was put up for
sale last November.
The government, which has a 83 per cent holding in RMC, invited private
sector companies to bid for the company rather than floating it on the stock
market. It has since received four offers for the business.
Havas, the French media group, made the highest offer with a bid worth
FFr540m (Dollars 93m). NRJ, the pop music radio station, bid FFr440m. The
offers from Alcatel-Alsthom, the electronics concern, and VSD, the weekly
magazine, were valued at FFr420m and FFr400m respectively.
However, the government had previously commissioned Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accountancy group, to prepare a formal valuation of RMC. Coopers is believed
to have estimated that the company was worth FFr600m, significantly more
than any of the private sector offers.
The economy ministry yesterday issued a statement saying that it had
scrapped plans to sell RMC as none of the bids for the company had matched
its minimum valuation.
Although price was the main obstacle to the RMC sale, the government faced
an additional deterrent in that the Conseil de la Concurrence, the French
competition authority, opposed the Havas bid on the grounds that the group
already has significant advertising interests.
Havas not only controls Euro:RSCG, the largest French marketing services
concern, but already has interests in broadcasting and billboards. It was
last month embroiled in a political row over its controversial decision to
effectively take control of Canal-Plus, the television group.
