  [Text] Moscow January 6 TASS -- The Russian Central 
Electoral Commission has announced on Thursday that elections to 
the new Russian parliament will be held in the self-styled 
Caucasian republic of Chechnya on March 13, 1994. 
  Chechnya, which proclaimed sovereignty, refused to hold 
elections to the new Russian legislature on December 12. 
  The Central Electoral Commission proposed to the people and 
the leadership of Chechnya to "consider and positively solve the 
issue of the republican participation in elections to the 
Federal Assembly of Russia in March 1994". 
  "The Chechen republic, according to the Russian 
Constitution, 
was and remains a fully-fledged subject of Russia and should be 
worthily represented in the Federal Assembly", the commission 
said.
