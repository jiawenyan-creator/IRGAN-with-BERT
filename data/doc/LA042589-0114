INDIA DOCKERS WORK AGAIN 
About 300,000 dockworkers returned to work Monday at India's 10 major ports 
after a successful six-day strike for higher wages, union leaders said. The 
strike had cut India's imports to a trickle and virtually paralyzed exports. A 
five-year wage accord between five dockworkers' unions and the government 
provides for increases ranging from $20 to $53 a month, effective next Jan. 1.
