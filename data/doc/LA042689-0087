THE WORLD; 
7-DAY BEIRUT TRUCE BLASTED 
A weeklong truce was shattered when Muslim militia members, backed by Syrian 
gunners, exchanged artillery fire with Christian forces in and around Beirut, 
police said. Initial reports said one person was killed and 13 wounded in the 
four-hour shelling of the Lebanese capital. The flare-up came hours after the 
United Nations called on the warring factions to end six weeks of bloodshed -- 
and on the eve of a conference of Arab League foreign ministers in Tunis aimed 
at solving the conflict. A series of brutal battles has claimed 250 lives since 
mid-March.
