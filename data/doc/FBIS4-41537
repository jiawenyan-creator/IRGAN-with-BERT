  [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin's 
decree on combatting gangsterism in the country comes into 
effect today. The law enforcement agencies are ready to start 
intensive work in keeping with the decree, according to First 
Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Mikhail Yegorov. 
  Yegorov said that violations of human rights can be avoided 
if the public is duly informed about any measures taken in line 
with the presidential decree. "Glasnost" (openness) is the main 
guarantor against any abuse of power by police, Yegorov stressed. 
  The signing of the president's decree was made necessary by 
experience, the deputy minister said. Organised criminal gangs 
are becoming increasing well-armed, ferocious and begin to 
dictate society their own terms with their gangland wars and 
explosions. Many hostages are being kept for ransom. Cases have 
been reported of close cooperation between Russian gangs with 
American cosa nostra and Sicilian mafia.
