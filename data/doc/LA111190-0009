 JON HENDRICKS "Freddie Freeloader" Denon 
Guest artists abound on this session. George Benson is in splendid virtuosic 
form, singing Hendricks' words to what was originally a Cannonball Adderley sax 
solo on the title cut, from Miles Davis' classic "Kind of Blue" date. 
On the same track, Bobby McFerrin sings the Wynton Kelly piano solo, Al Jarreau 
handles lyrics to Miles' solo and Hendricks himself tackles the John Coltrane 
passage. Hendricks' vocals with the Count Basie band on "Fas' Living Blues" and 
"The Finer Things in Life" are delightful. Wynton Marsalis has solos on two 
cuts and Manhattan Transfer, aided by multiple overdubbing, is gloriously 
effective on "High As a Mountain," based on Miles Davis-Gil Evans' "Song Number 
Two." Few weak numbers here, showing Hendricks remains the supreme master of 
vocalese. Leonard Feather
