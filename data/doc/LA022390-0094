SCREENING FOR SICKLE-CELL ANEMIA TO BE EXPANDED 
California Health Director Kenneth Kizer said that next week the state will 
offer expanded screening of babies for sickle-cell anemia as part of an effort 
to lower the black infant mortality rate. Kizer announced the plan Thursday 
during a tour of Martin Luther King Jr. 
/Drew Medical Center in Watts, one of four hospitals statewide that will share 
a grant of $1.3 million to expand prenatal services to black women. 
The infant mortality rate statewide is 8.6 babies for every 1,000; the rate 
among blacks is 15.8 per 1,000. 
Kizer said that, beginning Wednesday, the state will make sickle-cell anemia 
screening available to each of the estimated 525,000 infants born in California 
each year. The $365,000 set aside for King will go toward a collaborative 
effort with the Watts Health Foundations to expand maternal services in Compton 
and South Los Angeles. The state also awarded grants to the West Oakland Health 
Council, the East Bay Perinatal Council and San Joaquin General Hospital.
