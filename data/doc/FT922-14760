FT  04 APR 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Parked-car problems
IN 1973, I bought a builders' yard and buildings, but not the entrance road,
which is unadopted and serves other properties including one still owned by
the owners of the road. I was given right of way over the full width of the
road way, but because of the parking restriction now being enforced, more
people are parking in this entrance. On one side of the right of way these
cars park at right angles to the roadway, sometimes well out, which has made
it impossible for builders' merchants' lorries to deliver materials to our
premises. The owners of this road say the advice they have been given is
that it is up to us to take legal action. We have been advised that it is
the owners' responsibility.
We offered to pay for wheel-clamping: this was turned down by the owners,
who requested that we put up a 'no parking' sign. We argued that this would
not work - and so it has proved. Who is normally responsible for this
situation? If vehicles have parked in this entrance for a number of years
could they claim a permanent right to do so?
If the parking, particularly at right angles, substantially interferes with
your use of the right of way you do have a cause of action against the
individuals who park there, even if there are some who also claim to have a
right of way. You should invite your solicitors to consider seeking
injunctions and damages based on the principles in Celsteel Ltd v Alton
House Ltd 1985 1 WLR 205 (not affected on this point by the later appeal).
