FT  18 AUG 94 / Univeristies call for an end to cap on admissions
Universities yesterday predicted a 'massive denial of opportunity' to
school-leavers unless the government drops its policy of keeping the numbers
entering higher education at the same level for the next three years.
This year's A-level results, published today, suggest that the number of
18-year-olds achieving grades worthy of entrance to university this year was
only marginally up on last year.
However, the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals said that the
government had been 'saved' by a demographic dip of 4 per cent in the number
of children of school-leaving age. A spokesman said: 'Once the demographic
downturn turns into an upturn, as it will do shortly, that is going to mean
an absolute increase in the number of people reaching university standard.
At that point, the cap on admissions must come off.'
Mr Bryan Davies, Labour's higher education spokesman, said 'many thousands
more students' could have attended university if the government had allowed
expansion to continue as in previous years.
He added that tight government targets would mean that mature students would
'join the tail end of the queue' for university admission, while the
increased reliance on the university clearing system this year would be
'chaotic', leading to more drop-outs.
He said: 'The admissions system will need to be changed. It has become
archaic.'
Mr John Akker, general secretary of the Natfhe lecturers' union, said the
present arrangements allowed 'neither individuals nor institutions to plan
properly for their futures'.
Mr Eric Forth, the schools minister, said that admissions were the
responsibility of universities, and of the Universities and Colleges
Admissions Service, and he looked to them to ensure a 'smooth and orderly
start for all students'.
