PEOPLE: LYNN NAMED PRESIDENT OF PRICE CO. 
Mitchell G. Lynn, 42, has been named president of Price Co., the San 
Diego-based chain of membership discount warehouses. 
Price Co. stock closed down $1.375 to $36.875 in over the counter trading 
Monday but retail analyst Sarah Stack of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los 
Angeles discounted a "link between the news announcement and the stock price 
decline." 
Noting that Costco fell by $.75 and that May Co. was down $1 in Monday trading, 
Stack said other retail stocks declined on Monday, possibly a result of the 
segment being "overvalued" on the whole. 
Lynn has held a variety of posts within Price Co. since joining the company as 
controller in 1979. Most recently, he was president of Price Club Industries, 
which includes the chain's photo processing, optical services, food packaging 
and other warehouse operations. 
A certified public accountant, Lynn is a graduate of UCLA. He replaces Robert 
Price, who will continue to be Price Co. chief executive and board chairman. 
Lynn will be given a seat on Price's board of directors after the annual 
shareholders meeting next month, the company said.
