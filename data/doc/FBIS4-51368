  [Text] Shenzhen, May 26 (XINHUA) -- About 93 percent of the 
foreign-funded enterprises in the Shekou industrial zone are 
profitable. 
  One of the first such windows for foreign investment, Shekou 
is located in south of China's Shenzhen economic zone in south 
China's Guangdong Province. 
  According to a senior official of the China Merchants 
Holdings Co. Ltd, licensed in Hong Kong, which has developed the 
fishing village into a modern industrial zone by attracting 
foreign investment over the past 15 years, Shekou has introduced 
700 million U.S. dollars for the establishment of nearly 400 
joint ventures or enterprises solely owned by foreign investors. 
  Enterprises in the red are can blame poor management or 
changes in the international market, he said. 
  Since the beginning of this year industrialists and 
representatives of multinationals from the U.S., Europe and 
Southeast Asian countries have been flocking to the industrial 
zone in search of better investment opportunities, he noted.
