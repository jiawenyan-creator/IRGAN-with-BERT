BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY 
AST Research says its first personal computer targeted at the home and 
small-business market -- the recently introduced Bravo/286 -- is getting strong 
reviews from computer dealers. 
"The Bravo is doing very well," said Dan Sheppard, AST's senior manager of 
systems marketing. AST announced the new computer in early February. 
Demand for the Bravo, which carries a starting price of about $1,100, is 
currently exceeding AST's forecasts, Sheppard said. AST has had to boost 
production by 15% at the company plant in Taiwan, where the Bravo is 
manufactured. 
"We are scrambling right now to produce enough machines to keep the dealers 
stocked," Sheppard said. 
AST has shipped 3,000 of the machines and has orders for another 10,000, 
Sheppard said.
