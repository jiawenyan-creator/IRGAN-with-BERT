FT  03 SEP 94 / International Company News: Kuok sells part of TVB holding
for HKDollars 1bn
Mr Robert Kuok, the Malaysian financier, has sold 7.5 per cent of Television
Broadcasts, Hong Kong's premier television company, for more than HKDollars
1bn (USDollars 129.5m).
He placed 30m shares at HKDollars 35.80 each to investment institutions on
Thursday - the day after TVB unveiled a 70 per rise in first-half net
earnings to HKDollars 278m.
The sale has reduced Mr Kuok's stake in TVB to around 17 or 18 per cent. The
shares, when they were acquired in 1989, cost Mr Kuok HKDollars 14.60,
suggesting a gross profit on the transaction of around HKDollars 640m.
Analysts said Mr Kuok had been keen for some time to reduce his exposure to
TVB. He did not take an active interest in the management of the company,
but rather treated his near 25 per cent interest as an investment, they
said.
Mr Kuok had for several months been in talks with Pearson, the UK media and
banking group which owns the Financial Times, about the British group buying
up to 10 per cent of TVB.
Pearson has, however, confirmed that it pulled out of the talks a few weeks
ago on the grounds of price.
Analysts expect Mr Kuok to seek to reduce further his investment in TVB.
They note, however, that TVB's share price has performed well over the past
months.
Last month Mr Kuok, who has made Hong Kong his home, reduced his stake in
Shangri-La Asia - his hotels group - to 58.8 per cent form 61.5 per cent.
The placing of these shares realised HKDollars 676.2m.
The combined proceeds of the two placements leaves Mr Kuok with nearly
HKDollars 1.7bn. The money could go toward his ambitious plans for
residential property development in Hong Kong, and more investment ideas in
China.
