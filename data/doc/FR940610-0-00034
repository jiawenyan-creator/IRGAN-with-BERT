SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On February 11, 1994 (59 FR 6608), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Delaware. The
NPR proposed approval of the addition of section 36 and appendix J to Regulation No. 24, Stage II Vapor Recovery Regulations,
into Delaware's ozone SIP. Delaware formally submitted section 36 and appendix J of Regulation No. 24 to EPA as a SIP
revision on January 11, 1993, to comply with the Stage II vapor recovery requirements of section 182(b)(3) of the Act.
 


This rulemaking action is approving the addition of section 36 and appendix J into the Delaware ozone SIP. Section
36 and appendix J requires Stage II vapor recovery at gasoline dispensing facilities which dispense 10,000 gallons
per month (gpm) or more. Further discussion of the applicability of this regulation, as well as the compliance schedule
for Delaware's three counties are outlined in the NPR.
 

Other specific requirements of the Stage II Vapor Recovery Regulations for Gasoline Dispensing Facilities and the
rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. No public comments were
received on the NPR.





Final Action


EPA is approving the SIP revision to add Section 36Stage II Vapor Recovery and Appendix J, 

Procedures for Implementation of Regulations Covering Stage II Vapor Recovery Systems for Gasoline Dispensing
Facilities

 to Regulation No. 24, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions'' submitted by the State of Delaware on January
11, 1993. 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

This action had been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 22142225). However, in an October 4, 1993 memo, the Acting Assistant Administrator
for Air and Radiation, Michael H. Shapiro, revised these SIP tables so that Table 2 final actions on which no adverse
comments were received on the proposed rule may be delegated to Table 3 actions. No comments were received concerning
this action, therefore, under the new guidelines this final action may be classified as a Table 3 action. On January
6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of
section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for
Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This
request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30,
1993.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this approval of Stage II Vapor Recovery
Regulations for Gasoline Dispensing Facilities in the State of Delaware must be filed in the United States Court of
Appeals for the appropriate circuit by August 9, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
