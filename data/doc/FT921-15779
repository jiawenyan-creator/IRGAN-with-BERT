FT  08 JAN 92 / Brussels launches probe into cement industry
EUROPE'S cement industry is facing a long battle over its trading practices
with the launch of a European Commission inquiry into alleged illegal
cartels operated in the 1980s, writes Andrew Baxter.
Brussels has written to 76 European cement producers and organisations
claiming breaches of competition law.
The industry is likely to contest the issue fiercely. Mr Ian McKenzie, chief
executive of Blue Circle Cement, said the investigation was based on
'entirely circumstantial evidence' applying to what Brussels believed had
been happening in the 1980s.
European cement-makers meet regularly within Cembureau to discuss issues
surrounding the use of cement and concrete. Said Mr McKenzie: 'The EC are
saying that people who met for perfectly legitimate matters were doing
things of which they disapprove.'
The investigation has particularly incensed the British industry, which
operated a legally-approved 'common price and marketing agreement' until the
system was abandoned voluntarily in February 1987.
British companies had advised the EC in 1973 that the system, designed to
protect cement supplies and hold up prices, was in operation. 'It has taken
them 18 years to come back and say they don't like it,' said Mr McKenzie.
