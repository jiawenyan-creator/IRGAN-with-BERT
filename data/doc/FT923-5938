FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Scottish Value Trust seeks to raise Pounds
14m
SCOTTISH VALUE Trust, the investment trust which was formed in a revamp of
the shell company Bremner, is raising Pounds 14.2m via a placing and open
offer.
The trust acts as an arbitrageur in the investment trust sector. It buys
shares in trusts which are standing at a discount to their net asset values
and where there is a potential for gain as a result of a reorganisation or
change in investment policy.
Scottish Value achieved a net asset value total return (including reinvested
dividends) of 31.1 per cent in the year to July 31, compared with a 4.9 per
cent fall in the FT-A All-Share Index over the same period. The trust's
shares were trading at a 4 per cent premium to asset value before trading
opened yesterday. Normally, only trusts which trade at a premium can raise
extra capital. The share offer has an unusual structure. Existing
shareholders are being offered units at 100p each on the basis of 15 units
for every 24 existing shares.
These units will entitle investors to receive shares at a price to be
determined later, but which will effectively be equal to the prevailing net
asset value. To the extent that shares are not taken up by existing holders,
they will be placed with institutions.
The trust also declared a second interim dividend of 1p, payable on October
16. The new shares will not be entitled to receive the dividend and the
trust will not pay any further dividends in respect of the current financial
year to September 30.
The shares closed last night down 1p at 59 1/2 p.
