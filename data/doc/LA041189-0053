COUNCIL SPURS COMPETITION; 
2 GROUPS VIE FOR '90 AIR SHOW AT BROWN FIELD 
The San Diego City Council, after being promised that a revamped Air/Space 
America will pay off its 1988 air show debt and turn a profit in 1990, on 
Monday set up a two-way competition for the right to stage an aerial 
extravaganza at Brown Field next year. 
City Manager John Lockwood's staff was told by council to compare Air/Space 
America's 1990 show plans with a proposal to be submitted by U.S. Air Show, a 
new group. A recommendation is due by April 24, when council will decide 
whether to hold another show, whether to contribute $300,000 in city funds and 
which group to back. 
The decision followed a lengthy presentation by an overhauled team from 
Air/Space America, which on Feb. 7 lost the right to hold the show. At that 
time, council, citing doubts about Air/Space America's financial acumen and the 
1988 show debt, abruptly canceled the show and withdrew $300,000 in funding 
from hotel tax revenue. 
Damage to Brown Field 
The show also caused at least $65,000 in damage to Brown Field -- Councilman 
Bob Filner claimed Monday that the total is closer to $200,000 -- and resulted 
in some subcontractors suing the city to recoup losses. 
But Air/Space America promised Monday to pay off the debt before next year's 
May 4 show and to turn a profit of more than $900,000 from the 10-day event. 
Last year's show featured aerial acrobatics, trade booths, paratroop jumps and 
rides on the supersonic Concorde jet. 
"We hope to finish off this debt even before we hold the show," said Dick 
Shigley, the organization's new vice-president for finance and operations. 
The group also promised to keep the show in San Diego and end its adversary 
relationship with Lockwood's office, which had insisted on a performance bond 
for last year's show but was overruled by council. New executives and 
subcontractors have been added to the Air/Space group, and retired Rear Adm. 
Bill Walsh, whom some council members believe was the cause of last year's 
money problems, has been relieved of financial responsibilities. 
"We're going to get along with the city," Shigley said. "That's the bottom 
line." 
About $1 million in up-front revenue is expected to come from show "boosters," 
who will be asked to put up $25 each. In addition, organizers hope to get at 
least $500,000 from large corporations, which will be asked to join six other 
large firms that paid $100,000 to become "founders" of the 1988 show. 
Air/Space America has also signed up the Lufkin Group, which its officials 
described as an international marketing firm capable of generating large 
revenues by lining up official sponsors for the show. President Paul Lufkin 
said that the organization's revenue estimates for the show are understated. 
Debt Figures 
Lockwood acknowledged Monday that Air/Space America's 1988 debt is actually 
$2.7 million to $2.9 million, as the group has claimed since the debt 
controversy began two months ago. An audit conducted for the city had placed 
the debt at $4.2 million, but Lockwood told the council that Air/Space America 
will not be required to pay off the entire sum. 
Air/Space America, for example, said it does not intend to pay about $1 million 
to an unlicensed paving contractor who they maintain failed to adequately 
surface Brown Field. 
Council members acknowledged that the show, which in its first try became the 
world's third largest, is an important source of revenue and publicity for the 
city. 
But they expressed wariness about another debacle of unfulfilled promises, 
debts, traffic snafus, legal problems and damage to city-owned Brown Field. 
"This is a wonderful thing for San Diego if you guys have your act together, 
and that's what we're asking you to convince us," Councilman Bruce Henderson 
said. 
The U.S. Air Show group, organized by four men who oversaw major parts of the 
1988 Air/Space America show but have since split from the group, must quickly 
submit a plan to Lockwood's office to be considered for next year's show. 
The group appears to lack Air/Space America's political connections. It was 
Air/Space America founder and former Congressman Bob Wilson, along with former 
Congressman Lionel Van Deerlin, who appealed to Mayor Maureen O'Connor to 
schedule Monday's hearing. 
Wilson, who is chief executive officer of the organization, led Monday's 
presentation and has been lobbying council members for support.
