FEAR OF FLYING 
I would like to correct a misconception expressed in Patrick Flynn's letter 
(Dec. 31) in which he mistakenly concluded that UCI Medical Center has a 
counselor who treats flying anxieties while "higher priority" needs, i.e., drug 
addiction, are neglected. It was an unfortunate misunderstanding on his part of 
the original article that appeared on Dec. 24. 
I am the UCI counselor referred to in Mr. Flynn's letter, and I can assure him 
and any other readers who may also have misunderstood that the counseling and 
social work staff at UCIMC devote their energies to treating critical medical 
problems of patients and their families, including patients whose medical 
condition is complicated by drug dependence and addiction. 
The information contained in the article referred to by Mr. Flynn was 
voluntarily contributed as a public service for holiday air travelers. It is 
not part of any "luxury" services provided by the Medical Center with public 
funds. There is no cost to the university for the acquisition or dissemination 
of such information, and any individuals wishing treatment for air-travel 
anxieties are referred to the private sector. 
It's helpful for readers like Mr. Flynn to keep in mind that any major 
university has on staff numerous experts with wide-ranging interests. These 
individuals typically welcome opportunities to freely share their knowledge 
with the greater community, which was the intent of the original article. The 
sharing of such knowledge is one of the many benefits of having a major 
university in the community.
