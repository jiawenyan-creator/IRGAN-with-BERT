ADMINISTRATION SCRAPS 'LET IT BURN' POLICY AT NATIONAL PARKS THIS YEAR; 
'LET IT BURN' PARK POLICY SCRAPPED 
The Bush Administration has decided to scrap the controversial "let it burn" 
policy at national parks for this year's forest fire season, it was reported 
today. 
Quoting officials in Washington and at Yellowstone National Park, which was 
devastated by wildfires last summer, the Washington Post said political 
concerns appear to have overridden scientific assessments for the short term. 
When the 1988 fires raged out of control for months, much of a dismayed 
American public criticized the government's burn policy although it was 
endorsed by experts. 
"Word has come from Washington that (this year) we are to fight every fire, 
including those caused by nature," Yellowstone spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo said. 
"When the first lightning bolt torches the first tree this summer, we'll have a 
helicopter out there to attack."
