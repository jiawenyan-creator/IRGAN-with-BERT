FT  01 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
GILTS held the key to the fortunes of the stock index futures with a
lacklustre start to trading ahead of the gilt auction results, Christine
Buckley writes.
The announcement that the auction was only 1.1 times oversubscribed against
a market expectation of 1.5 times unnerved some investors and the September
contract fell to 2,900 its low of the day, its recent resistance level.
September followed the recovery in the gilts and was aided by technical
support.
There were few other pointers for a market which managed a volume of only
6,640 contracts. Some of its buoyancy was attributed to window dressing at
the end of the second quarter.
Faint hopes of interest rate cut hopes rose to the surface on the thinking
that if gilt auctions attract fewer buyers the government may have to
stimulate interest with a rate cut.
The index hit its high of 2,922 just after Wall Street opened with sellers
pushing it down slightly in late trading to a finish of 2,917. As in the
previous day's trade it mustered a close of 6 points ahead of its fair value
premium to cash of 11 points.
Hanson performed well in traded options on news of its acquisition of
Quantum Chemical with 6,589 lots traded - well ahead of the Euro-FT-SE which
saw 3,357 lots change hands. Total turnover was 32,381.
