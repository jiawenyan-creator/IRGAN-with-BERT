  [Excerpt] Acting Prime Minister Dr. Ma'n Abu-Nuwar has 
denied that Jordan has signed any accord with the PLO other than 
the economic accord which was signed on 7 January. This 
statement, which he made to SAWT AL-SHA'B, is contrary to what 
was reported by news agencies and some papers that a security 
accord was recently signed between the Jordanian and Palestinian 
sides. 
  Mahmud 'Abbas, also known as Abu-Mazin and a member of the 
PLO Executive Committee, said--in a telephone interview SAWT 
AL-SHA'B conducted with him in Tunis--that the Palestinian 
leadership had discussed the draft security accord prepared by 
the territory, border, and security committee, which is 
considered one of the most important committees of the Joint 
Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Committee and which was formed 
before the Palestinian-Israeli accord was signed. He added that 
the Palestinian leadership sent the draft security accord to 
Major General Fahkri Shaqquraq, chief of Palestinian 
intelligence, who is currently in Amman. [passage omitted]
