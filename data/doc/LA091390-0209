ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH 
DEAD RINGER: Nowadays, who would hire a lobbyist who looks just like Saddam 
Hussein? Lots of people, hopes Jerry Haleva, above, longtime aide to former 
Orange County state Sen. William Campbell and now a fledgling Sacramento 
lobbyist. . . . Haleva so resembles the Iraqi leader that he's been signed by a 
Hollywood look-alike agency in hopes of a movie role. Since Hussein became big 
news, people stare, Haleva says, but so far his resemblance has caused no 
problems. "But if he drops one chemical weapon, I lose the mustache." Jeffrey
