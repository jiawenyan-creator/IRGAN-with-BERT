3 AMERICANS HURT IN DEA COPTER CRASH 
A helicopter loaned to Peru by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration crashed 
near the city of Tingo Maria, injuring all five crew members, including three 
Americans, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said. 
The chopper, a UHU-HC on loan to the Peruvian police, was reportedly flying in 
a formation of three when an engine lost power northeast of Lima. The spokesman 
did not identify the Americans -- the pilot, a medic and mechanic. The Peruvian 
co-pilot and gunner also were injured. The DEA is supporting Peru's fight 
against coca, used to produce cocaine.
