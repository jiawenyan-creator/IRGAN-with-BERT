SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On November 18, 1994, the Authority granted, in part, an application for review of the Acting Regional Director's
Decision and Order in 

Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center, Port Hueneme, California and National Association of Government
Employees, Local R1228, 

No. SFCU40012, and consolidated cases. A copy of the decision may be obtained in the Authority's Case
Control Office at the aforementioned address; a copy will be forwarded (by mail or facsimile) to any interested person
who so requests by contacting Alicia Columna at the same address. A brief summary of the case follows.



The union filed clarification of unit (CU) petitions requesting that certain recognized bargaining units be clarified
to include employees who it claimed has accreted to the units as a result of a reorganization which (1) disestablished
the employing entity in which the units were originally recognized (the previous entity) and (2) created a new entity
(the current employing activity) encompassing the previous one as well as others in which no labor organizations
held exclusive recognition. The union claimed that the new entity was the successor employer to the one in which recognition
previously was granted. The current employing activity filed representative status (RA) petitions challenging
the continued appropriateness of the units for which clarification was sought.

Applying the factors for determining successorship set forth in 

Department of Energy, Western Area Power Administration, 

3 FLRA 77 (1980) (

DOE

), the Acting Regional Director (ARD) dismissed the CU petitions and directed that representation elections be conducted.
These factors are: (1) The existing unit must be transferred substantially intact to the gaining employer; (2) the
appropriateness of the unit must remain unimpaired in the gaining employer; and (3) a question concerning representation
(QCR) may not be timely raised as to the representative status of the incumbent union. In the ARD's view, the second


DOE 

factor was not met because the reorganization had substantially changed the character and scope of the former units
so that the appropriateness of the units was impaired, and the third 

DOE 

factor was not met because the RA petitions filed by current employing activity raised a QCR.
