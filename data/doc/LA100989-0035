THE WORLD 
The United States will continue producing chemical weapons even after a new 
global treaty authorizing their destruction begins to take effect, U.S. 
officials said. President Bush did not mention this intent when he told the 
United Nations last month that he favors immediate steps to "halt and reverse" 
the threat of chemical arms, the Washington Post reported. However, officials 
who asked not to be named said Bush has decided to continue producing chemical 
weapons after a secret policy review. They said the Defense Department contends 
that U.S. plans for producing an arsenal of "binary" chemical weapons, which 
employ two components that become lethal when combined, will likely be at an 
early stage when a new treaty is finished. It said continued production is 
needed in case the treaty's provisions cannot be implemented.
