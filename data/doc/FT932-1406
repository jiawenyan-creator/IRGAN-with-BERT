FT  24 JUN 93 / Bulgarian leader attacks his critics
PRESIDENT Zhelyu Zhelev yesterday accused the Union of Democratic Forces
(UDF), Bulgaria's main opposition group, of deliberately trying to stir up
social tension in the country.
'The UDF leadership is exporting its internal problems and attempting to
present them as problems of society at large,' the president said in
reference to anti-government rallies the UDF has organised in recent weeks.
But the president said the UDF, a loose alliance of 17 anti-communist
parties, was losing ground to the Socialist party (ex-communist) in the
latest opinion polls and had been unable to increase support in the country.
The UDF, whose one-year-old government fell last October after losing a vote
of confidence, has claimed that hundreds of thousands of Bulgarians have
attended its rallies during which the coalition has demanded that the
president resign and call new elections.
Independent sources say that only a few thousand people have attended the
UDF demonstrations and that many supporters have been bused into Sofia from
the countryside by the party.
