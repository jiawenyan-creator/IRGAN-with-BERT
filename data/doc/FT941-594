FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: MIM seeks Cannington stake
MIM Holdings, the Brisbane-based metals group, is negotiating to buy a
one-third interest in the Cannington silver-lead mining project which Broken
Hill Proprietary (BHP), the large natural resources group, is exploring in
north-west Queensland.
Melbourne-based BHP discovered the ore-body back in 1990, and is part way
through a feasibility study. It said yesterday that it had been talking for
some time to MIM, which has smelting capacity at Mount Isa, about 200km
north-west of Cannington.
The agreement between the two companies would allow MIM to acquire a 33.3
per cent interest in Cannington, including exploration in a surrounding area
of 50 square kilometres. It would also stipulate that MIM smelt two-thirds
of the total Cannington production of silver-lead concentrate at its
'Isasmelt' plant at Mount Isa. This would be made up of MIM's one-third
share of the total production, plus half of BHP's remaining share, which MIM
would purchase.
Cannington is currently estimated to contain an inferred resource of 47m
tonnes, grading 10.7 per cent lead, 4.6 per cent zinc and 470 grams per
tonne silver. The feasibility study is due to be completed by the end of the
current calender year, and any agreement would take place after that.
Development of a mine would then be due for completion in the 1997 financial
year, with sales commencing in 1988. The expected development cost of the
project has been put at ADollars 225m (USDollars 160m).
