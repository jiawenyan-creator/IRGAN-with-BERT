  [Text] National Unity Party [NUP] leader Dervis Eroglu's 
resignation was rejected by the party council. Eroglu submitted 
his resignation as party leader to the council during a meeting 
this afternoon. The party council, however, unanimously 
rejected Eroglu's resignation and asked him to continue his duty. 
  In a statement to the press, Eroglu explained that he 
reached 
a point of resignation following certain speculative reports, 
but in line with the decision of the party council, he will try 
to fulfill the NUP's duties to the community in unity and 
solidarity with his colleagues. Eroglu said that the party 
council also decided to prepare for the local elections to be 
held in June and accept the results collectively. Pointing out 
that the NUP is totally united, Eroglu noted that there are 
attempts to play tricks on his party. Hakki Atun, Democratic 
Party leader and prime minister, is seeking to settle accounts 
with the NUP, Eroglu charged, adding that rivalry in politics 
should not cause hostility.
