NHL OPENING SEASON OF PERSONAL GOALS 
When the NHL opens its 73rd season with nine games Thursday night, Wayne 
Gretzky will not be the only one shooting for a milestone. 
While Gretzky's pursuit of Gordie Howe's all-time scoring record may overshadow 
other individual achievements, several other players also have their eyes on 
new levels. 
Three players have a chance this season to reach the career 1,000-point mark, 
and another player has a shot at the 500-goal level. 
Quebec's Peter Stastny is closest to 1,000 points, needing just 14 to join the 
exclusive club. Edmonton's Jari Kurri is 50 points away and Chicago's Denis 
Savard 67. 
Bryan Trottier of the New York Islanders figures to join the 500-goal club this 
season. He needs just 13 to make it. Trottier also needs 32 assists to move 
past Phil Esposito (873) into fifth place on the all-time assist list. 
Four players are gunning for milestones in the assist category. Larry Robinson 
of the Kings is closing in on 700, and Pittsburgh's Paul Coffey, Montreal's 
Bobby Smith and Boston's Ray Bourque are nearing 600. Robinson needs 14 assists 
to reach his milestone, Coffey needs 5, Smith 10 and Bourque 56. 
Meanwhile, Gretzky will continue his pursuit of Howe's scoring record of 1,850 
points when the Los Angeles Kings play host to the Toronto Maple Leafs in one 
of Thursday night's openers. (Story, Part III, Page 1.) The Kings center needs 
just 14 to surpass the Detroit Red Wings' great.
