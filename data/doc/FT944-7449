FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Capital increase for Von Roll
Von Roll, the troubled Swiss steel and engineering group, said it would
slash its SFr184m (Dollars 140m) equity capital by 90 per cent and then
increase it to SFr190.9m through a rights issue to shareholders and
bondholders.
This is the second significant restructuring programme in less than a year
for the group, in which Proventus, the Swedish industrial investment group,
has a 28.1 per cent stake.
Von Roll said in a statement that this latest capital injection was made
necessary only by continuing troubles at its toxic waste disposal plant in
the US. Other operations were recovering as planned.
The waste plant's start-up last year came two years late because of blocking
manoeuvres by environmentalists, and some of its sensitive equipment froze
during a cold snap last winter.
Recently, it has suffered from a slump in the market, and Von Roll said
yesterday that it would continue for some time to incur losses.
The registered shares and participation certificates would be abolished,
creating a single class of SFr10 bearer shares.
Shareholders would be given a subscription right to the upcoming capital
rise at the rate of 11 new shares at SFr25 for each SFr100 nominal of
existing capital. The board would be reduced to five from the current nine
members.
Von Roll said it would suffer a loss this year, its fourth in succession,
but expected to report a modest group net profit in 1995 and a satisfactory
profit in 1996.
