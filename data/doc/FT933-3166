FT  15 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Delta
The UK stock market has already put on its glad rags to celebrate the
recovery party, but Delta has become the latest of a string of companies to
suggest that the champagne should be left on ice. That the cables market
remains subdued should come as no surprise to those who heard BICC's
comments last month. Still, the market was sufficiently unnerved by Delta's
near-static profits and cautious trading statement to knock 8 per cent off
its shares.
There is little doubt that the theory underpinning the surge in Delta's
shares over the year is sound. Like so many engineering companies, Delta
should experience a sharp pick-up in profits on even small increases in
sales. The upswing should be accentuated as prices recover. At present, they
are languishing at less than three-quarters of their peak. Moreover, Delta
has gone a long way to put its own house in order. Having chopped its
workforce by 30 per cent since 1989, it is now wielding the axe at its
recession-struck plants in mainland Europe. The balance sheet is strong
enough for it to contemplate a splash of acquisitive growth.
The unknowable factor is the speed and strength of the upturn. Delta's
experience only confirms the impression that recovery stocks have generally
shot too far ahead of the game. Top down forecasts may set the market's
mood. The bottom up numbers, though, will determine its final shape.
