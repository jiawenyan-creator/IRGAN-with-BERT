FT  05 MAY 93 / Observer: Uncorked
Two peeps behind the scenes of the Californian wine industry recently - one
of a public nature, the other not officially so.
Last week the king of Napa Valley, 80-year-old Robert Mondavi, announced
that his family's winery was making its first share issue. A sobre matter,
however, compared with the publication of a grippingly scurrilous
unauthorised biography of the world's largest wine company built up by
Ernest and Julio Gallo.
In Blood and Wine by Ellen Hawkes, Ernest, in his mid-80s, is portrayed as
the domineering oldest brother who has bullied his way to establishing E&amp;J
Gallo as a secretive, conservatively-run, mass-market wine empire -
achieving sales of around 70m cases worth more than Dollars 1bn a year,
according to trade estimates.
Julio, who suffered a fatal road accident on one of the family's many
ranches at the weekend, was officially in charge of wine-making, but is
painted by Hawkes as a compliant softie. Meanwhile, the baby of the family,
Joseph, was marginalised; even his own small cheese-making efforts were
banned, after a bitter court case, from using the Gallo name.
But so powerful is the Gallo empire, based without so much as a nameplate in
the small California town of Modesto, that this book represents virtually
the first whiff of criticism of a winery more usually associated with its
atmospheric advertisements.
