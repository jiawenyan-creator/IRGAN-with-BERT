FT  26 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Matif delays contract listing
on Globex
THE MATIF, in a last-minute move, has postponed listing its largest
contract, Notional bond futures, on the Chicago-based Globex electronic
trading system. The contract was to have been added to the system today.
Matif said technical problems had prompted the decision. Globex is owned by
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, and Reuters
Holdings.
A Matif spokeswoman said: 'The Notional bond is our biggest contract. We
want to make sure the system is 99.9 per cent certain before we launch.'
She said Reuters Holdings, which designed and operates the system, was
working to fix the technical problems, adding there was no new listing date
for the contract.
Globex has nearly doubled its volume since Matif listed its Pibor and Ecu
contracts on the system on March 12.
