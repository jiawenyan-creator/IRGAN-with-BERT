FT  09 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Welsh success in poll tax receipts
DISTRICT councils in Wales have been so successful in collecting the poll
tax in the current financial year that receipts exceeded the estimated
amount by Pounds 16m, Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, disclosed in the
Commons yesterday, Ivor Owen writes.
He said the money would be used to reduce the burden of the council tax,
which will replace the poll tax in April.
Mr Hunt again insisted that the Pounds 2.6bn the government would provide
for local government services in Wales in the coming financial year should
ensure 'reasonable' council tax bills.
He stressed that 90 per cent of all local authority revenue expenditure
would be funded by central government support, and enable just over Pounds
900 to be spent on every man, woman and child in Wales.
Mr Ron Davies, Labour's shadow Welsh secretary, strongly disputed the
minister's claim that the level of grant should make it unnecessary for any
local authority to cut capital spending programmes.
Mr Davies maintained that the money being provided by the government would
not be adequate to allow vital public services to be retained, and result,
at a conservative estimate, in the destruction of some 2,500 jobs in the
public sector.
