SHORT TAKES; 
BEATTY LOSING HIS MYSTIQUE 
Television producers say Warren Beatty is losing some of his mystique as he 
heavily promotes his role in the movie "Dick Tracy." 
"I would imagine the we-got-to-have-him attitude is somewhat diminished," Jack 
Riley, executive producer of ABC's "Good Morning America," said in the July 7 
issue of TV Guide. 
"But actually, now that he's gotten into it, he's a far better interview than 
he has been," he said. 
Beatty had stonewalled seasoned interviewer Barbara Walters early on, and 
producers were wary of the once elusive star. 
"Donahue" senior producer Lorri Benson said she was "pleasantly surprised" by 
Beatty's openness when he appeared on the syndicated show. There were no 
preconditions and no taboo subjects, and Beatty spontaneously agreed to appear 
on the show a second time, she said. 
Riley also was leery of scheduling a Beatty interview. He had previously dealt 
with the star when he was touting his mega-bomb "Ishtar." Beatty taped a 
segment for "Good Morning America" but later made so many demands that the 
producers "dumped the whole thing," Riley said. 
The only constraint in the interview for "Dick Tracy" was that 11-year-old 
co-star Charlie Korsmo be on with him.
