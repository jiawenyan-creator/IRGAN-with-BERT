  [Text] Lima, 31 May (EFE) -- Lima newspapers reported on 31 
May that a Peruvian judge has rejected the conditional release 
of one general and 11 military officers arrested on charges of 
drug trafficking. 
  Judge Gloria Arteaga dismissed the petition to release the 
military officers as inadmissible, because "important steps to 
confirm or dismiss the charges" filed by military justice 
against them are still pending. 
  The Army placed General Jaime Rios, former Huallaga Front 
commander, and the other 11 military officers indicted with him 
at the disposal of civilian courts after it was discovered that 
they had covered up drug trafficking activities in the region. 
  The officers involved, besides Gen. Rios, are: Lieutenant 
Colonels Luis Aparicio and Marco Zarate; Majors Marco Landor, 
Alejandro Mutante, and Eliseo Gonzalez; Captains Oswaldo Zapata, 
Carlos Hernandez, and Carlos Marin; Lieutenant Rolando Chiotty; 
and noncommissioned officers Roberto Zarate and Luis Gomez. 
  In 1991 all of them were stationed in the Huallaga Valley, 
the largest cocaine paste production center in the world. 
  The officers are accused of having charged a fee to permit 
drug traffickers to ship their cocaine paste to Colombia. 
  The lawsuit says that the military charged a fee of $8,000 
for single engine planes and $15,000 for twin engine planes, to 
permit them to land and take off in the zone to collect drugs. 
  The money was collected by Uchiza's former Mayor Demetrio 
Diaz and Uchiza's former Governor Carlos Rodriguez. The two are 
currently fugitives. 
  Drug traffickers provided medicines and food to the troops 
through a "civic committee" that coordinated "donations" made 
through Maj. Landor and Lt. Col. Zarate. These two are 
currently in jail under charges of trying to depose Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori in 1992.
