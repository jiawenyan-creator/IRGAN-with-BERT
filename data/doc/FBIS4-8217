  [Text] Mirko Jovic, chairman of the Serbian People's 
Defense Party, said in a statement for Belgrade Radio that an 
aggression was carried out on Serbian land. All U.S. citizens 
that are currently anywhere on the Serbian territory should be 
told that we consider them to be aggressors and that we are 
going to treat them as such. If one more aircraft takes off 
from Italian territory to fly to Serbian space, we are going to 
consider this to be participating in the aggression, because of 
which one should declare war on Italy, Mirko Jovic pointed out. 
He added that the FRY Government is obligated to proclaim 
general mobilization and ban the work of all media with a 
pro-U.S. orientation.
