FT  30 OCT 92 / Magyars defuse row on secession
ROMANIA's ethnic Hungarians yesterday denied they wanted to secede from
Bucharest in a move aimed at defusing a political row created by a
declaration last weekend that they desired self-government, writes Virginia
Marsh from Bucharest.
The Democratic Union of Magyars in Romania (DUMR) said secession was in any
case impossible given that regions where Hungarians formed the majority were
in the centre of Romania.
Instead, they said that ethnic Hungarian communities only wished for greater
autonomy in order to preserve their religious and cultural identity, which
were granted by the constitution.
The DUMR's earlier declaration had fuelled Romania's nationalist parties
which in last month's general election won 22 per cent of the votes in
Transylvania, Romania's western province where most of the 1.7m ethnic
Hungarian minority live.
Romanian nationalists have interpreted the DUMR statement as further proof
that the party aims to restore Transylvania to Hungarian rule and accused
the DUMR of repratedly trying to destabilise the country.
