  [Text] Bratislava, May 15 (CTK) -- "I consider this 
cheek," Milan Ftacnik, deputy chairman of the Democratic Left 
Party (SDL), commented on the advertisement on competition for 
posts published by the HZDS (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia) 
in public offices in Friday's edition of the daily PRAVDA. "This 
proves that the HZDS is still striving to become a 
`state-party'," Ftacnik told the Slovak Radio, thus referring to 
the ruling role of the Communists in the previous regime. 
  He said he would not object if the HZDS won the elections 
and 
from the governmental posts organized this sort of competition. 
"But to conduct a competition for the public offices as a party 
has breached the Constitution which stipulates separation of the 
parties from the state. The HZDS has proved that it pushes for 
a party-state in which a party instead of constitutional bodies 
would decide," Ftacnik added, "categorically protesting" against 
making this sort of advertisements. 
  "Those who successfully pass the course for the public 
offices in Slovakia will enter them in October-December 1994," 
the HZDS advertisement promises. The applicants for top 
positions in industry, tertiary sector, state administration, 
foreign service, banking and financial sphere must be Slovak 
nationals under 38, university graduates with organizational 
abilities and mastery of foreign languages. The competition 
will take place on September 9. The parliamentary elections are 
held on September 30-October 1.
