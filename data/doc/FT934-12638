FT  26 OCT 93 / Judge raps child maintenance tactic
A COURT ruling in favour of a divorced father yesterday threw into question
a tactic of the Child Support Agency which many separated fathers claim is
financially crippling them.
A series of sharp rises in maintenance payments imposed by the agency, set
up by the government in April to ensure absentee fathers pay for their
children's upbringing, have prompted a number of complaints.
The father in the case before Teesside County Court was divorced seven years
ago and is now settled into another relationship. He was paying Pounds 120 a
month to his ex-wife, who looked after their two children.
The court heard how she went to court and revoked the maintenance order on
the advice of the agency.
As the man was therefore not technically paying any maintenance, the agency
was able to assess the matter and ruled he must pay Pounds 480 a month to
his former wife.
But Judge David Bryant said yesterday: 'It is not enough simply for a person
to come to court and say 'I wish to go to the Child Support Agency, please
revoke the existing order'.'
He said that if the mother needed more money, normally the correct procedure
should be an application to the court to increase the existing maintenance
payment.
The judge reinstated the order for Pounds 120 a month and ruled that none of
those involved should be identified.
