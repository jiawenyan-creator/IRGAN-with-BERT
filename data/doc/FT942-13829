FT  22 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Japan's brokers play down new
commission rules
The liberalisation of stock market commissions on Japanese transactions of
more than Y1bn has not hurt brokers, according to the Japan Securities
Dealers' Association, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The association said there were not many transactions of more than Y1bn in
the current dull market conditions. 'I have not heard of any problems
following the April 1 liberalisation,' said chairman Mr Masaru Aratani. He
welcomed the latest move by research institutes to release their own ratings
of listed companies.
