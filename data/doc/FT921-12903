FT  24 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Computer games learn their
lesson
DISGRUNTLED parents, who find that the toys they bought at Christmas have
either been discarded or have turned into an obsession, may prefer to join
the growing number of consumers who have turned to electronic learning aids.
Stimulated by the national fixation for electronic games, the UK market for
such learning aids has doubled in three years, according to a report from
the Economist Intelligence Unit. Nevertheless, with the market for 1991
valued at Pounds 23m, the market is still tiny compared with the Pounds 325m
market for electronic games.
More than half the products sold in the sector are for five- to
ten-year-olds, according to the Retail Business report. The largest
suppliers in the UK are VTech, Adams Leisure/Grandstand and Texas
Instruments.
Although the report predicts the market will grow by 20 per cent a year, the
authors believe the sector needs a 'blockbuster' product to project learning
aids into the mainstream toy market. This may not happen until 1995.
