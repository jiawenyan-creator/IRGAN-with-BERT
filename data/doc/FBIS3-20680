  [Text] Manojlo Milovanovic, chief of staff of the army of 
the republic of Srpska, stated yesterday that "the Serbian side 
does not approve of the attempt to open Dubrava airport near 
Tuzla by force." 
  "No plane that might land there would ever be able to take 
off" Manojlovic specified in a conversation with TANJUG 
correspondent Vladimir Elez. At the same time he noted that 
"nobody has made any official request to discuss the possibility 
of opening Dubrava airport near Tuzla; threats to do it by force 
were used instead." 
  General Milovanovic recalled that the Serbian side had 
earlier granted the use of Sarajevo airport to the United 
Nations for humanitarian needs. "However, in order to achieve 
their own military objectives, the Muslims now want their own 
airport, and they want it in Tuzla." According to Milovanovic, 
this is fully consistent with the Muslim plans to establish 
territorial links between Tuzla, Zenica, and Sarajevo, and it 
reflects other military needs as well. 
  As for Srebrenica, General Milovanovic stressed that "this 
is 
an imaginary problem. As far as the Serbian side is concerned, 
the replacement of the Canadian unit in Srebrenica was never a 
problem, nor is it now." He concluded that in essence the latest 
events involving Tuzla and Srebrenica represent "a new attempt 
to encourage the Muslim side to continue the war."
