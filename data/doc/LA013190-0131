TILLMAN GIVES COMEBACK A LIFT WITH KNOCKOUT 
Henry Tillman, the 1984 Olympic heavyweight champion whose pro career plummeted 
nearly as quickly as his amateur career had ascended, knocked out former 
Mexican heavyweight champion Gerardo Valero of Tijuana just 1 minute 7 seconds 
into the second round of a scheduled 10-round bout Tuesday night at the Country 
Club in Reseda. 
Tillman, who won the North American Boxing Federation championship in 1986 in 
just his 10th pro fight, lost to Bert Cooper later that year and then was 
crushed by former Olympic team roommate Evander Holyfield in 1987. 
He later lost to Canadian Doug de Wit -- the man he defeated in the Olympic 
final -- and also lost to little-known Duane Bonds. 
He stayed out of the ring for a year and a half before launching a comeback 
last December in Florida.
