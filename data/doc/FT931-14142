FT  20 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television
A Wagnerian figure disappears into oblivion tonight, and a third of the
British population will be there to see it. On ITV at 8.00 Inspector Morse
sets out on his 28th and last investigation, and Oxford can cease to be the
murder capital of the kingdom.
John Thaw, who plays Morse, and his sidekick Kevin Whateley (Sergeant
Lewis), have decided to call it a day, although they will probably be
tempted back for the odd Christmas special. The end of Morse is sad for an
audience which now tops 18m; sad for Central TV, which has sold it to nearly
50 countries; and sad for Beamish stout, whose sales have soared since it
began to sponsor the series.
But Morse is going out on a high note with a murder at a degree ceremony, a
script by Julian Mitchell, and a cameo performance by Sir John Gielgud.
When a Government Minister in the 1970s, Tony Benn had the satisfaction of
occupying an office in a tower block on the site of his boyhood home. He has
never really left Westminster in all his 67 years and is an ideal guide in
Snapshots (Channel 4, 9.45) in which celebrities re-visit the scenes of
their childhood.
