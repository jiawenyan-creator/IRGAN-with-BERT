FT  11 NOV 93 / People: Thinking about local government
Brian Redhead, 63, who steps down as presenter of the Today programme in a
few months' time, is to be chairman of a new think-tank which will
investigate the state of local government in England and Wales.
Redhead, who has become one of Britain's best-known radio broadcasters
during his 18 years on the Today programme, is no stranger to controversy
and his new post will give him a chance to contribute to the sometimes
acrimonious debate about the reform of local government in Britain.
The new think-tank, which is called the Commission for Local Democracy and
will have a two-year life, has tried to guarantee its independence by not
taking funding from either local or central government. It has raised funds
from a number of sources including Unity Trust Bank and the Municipal
Journal.
David Clark, 36, director of the new body, says that local democracy is in
'need of friends and we hope we can contribute to its strengthening in
future'. The aim will be to analyse some of the ills that beset local
government and suggest solutions.
The organisation has nine commissioners who will oversee its work and draw
up its recommendations. Apart from Redhead, they include Roger Jefferies
(formerly an under-secretary, environment department, and chief executive,
London Borough of Croydon); Steve Bullock (former Labour leader of London
borough of Lewisham); Jane Clark (former Liberal leader of South Somerset
District Council); Gareth Gimblett (former Conservative leader of Berkshire
County Council); Simon Jenkins (former editor of The Times); Gerry Stoker
(Professor of Politics, Strathclyde University); Kieron Walsh (Professor of
Public Sector Management, Birmingham University) and Sally Witcher
(director, Child Poverty Action Group).
