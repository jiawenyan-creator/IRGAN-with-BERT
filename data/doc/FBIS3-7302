  [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Japan's top economic 
planner on Friday [25 March] voiced strong concern over the 
recent sharp increases in rice prices. Rice prices began rising 
last year after a bad harvest and the trend is still going on, 
Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency 
(EPA), told a regular press conference. 
  The uptrend is "very serious," Kubota said. 
  She said the EPA will carefully monitor rice price trends 
and 
take adequate steps if necessary, while keeping in touch with 
the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry. 
  Kubota's comments came following a government report that 
consumer prices of rice in Tokyo rose 7.4 percent in March from 
a month earlier, the sharpest monthly growth in nearly 17 years. 
The price of rice in March soared 19.7 percent from a year 
earlier.
