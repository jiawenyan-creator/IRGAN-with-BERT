<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; partial extension of compliance date; reopening of administrative record. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing a partial extension of the compliance date of and giving interested
persons an opportunity to comment on the scope of a provision of the final rule, which published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 3, 1993 (58 FR 41348), that revised the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for certain
labeling control provisions. The agency is taking this action to assess further the availability of equipment necessary
for compliance with the regulation for items of labeling (other than immediate container labels) and to address concerns
about the scope of a particular provision of that rule in partial response to two citizen petitions that were submitted
to FDA. 

</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 The final rule published at 58 FR 41348, August 3, 1993, is effective August 3, 1994. The labeling provisions (other
than for the immediate container label) in 211.122(g) must be complied with on August 3, 1995, unless modified
as discussed in section II. below. Submit written comments by October 4, 1994.

I. Partial Extension of The Compliance Date 


In the 

Federal Register

 of August 3, 1993 (58 FR 41348), FDA published a final rule that amended the CGMP regulations to require that certain
special control procedures be instituted if cut labeling is used. One of the options available under these procedures
requires the use of ``appropriate electronic or electromechanical equipment to conduct a 100-percent examination
for correct labeling during or after completion of finishing operations***.'' (21 CFR 211.122(g)(2)). 
On May 4, 1994, FDA received a citizen petition from five trade associations requesting that the agency take a number
of actions including, but not limited to, extending the August 3, 1994, effective date of this rule as it applies to
labeling (other than the immediate container labels) as defined in section 201(m) of Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321 (m)). The petition states that additional time is needed because of the unavailability
of bar code or machine readers as well as other equipment necessary to orient the labeling codes properly, and the petition
also requests that FDA reopen its administrative record to reassess the scope of a certain provision of the regulation,
as discussed in section II. of this document. 
On May 6, 1994, the agency received an additional petition from a trade association that requested, among other things,
a 1-year stay of the effective date; the petitioner stated that additional time is needed to locate, install, and validate
scanning equipment and other necessary equipment to orient items properly for bar code scanning. 
Currently, appropriate electronic or electromechanical equipment primarily consists of systems that scan identity
codes printed on labeling. If an incorrect code is detected, the defective labeling is ejected from the labeling line.
FDA has contacted vendors of this equipment and has not found a general shortage of system hardware. The agency has
determined, however, that there may be a shortage of contract engineering firms that are employed by some drug manufacturers
to evaluate, select, purchase, install, qualify, and validate labeling verification systems. 
FDA believes that proper validation of electromechanical labeling control systems is vital to the effective operation
of such systems and the prevention of potentially dangerous labeling mixups. The agency is, therefore, as discussed
in section II. of this document, extending to August 3, 1995, the compliance date of 211.122(g) as it applies
to items of labeling other than the immediate container label in order to assess further the availability of equipment
necessary for compliance with the final rule and to evaluate adequately other issues raised by petitioners. 


II. Reopening of The Administrative Record 


The first petition also requests that the agency reopen the administrative record to receive additional comments
on the application of 211.122(g) to items of labeling (other than that of the immediate container label) as
defined in section 201(m) of the act. Both citizen petitions contend that final 211.122(g) expanded the proposed
scope of the provision from immediate container labels to all drug product labeling. 
Although FDA disagrees with these assertions, it is willing to receive comments on this issue and to evaluate those
comments in light of the existing language in 211.122(g). After assessing the comments, FDA will provide notice
in the 

Federal Register

 of the agency's decision on whether or not to retain 211.122(g) in its current state. If the agency decides to
retain the current provision, compliance will be required on August 3, 1995. FDA notes that the proposed rule is replete
with references to ``labeling;'' 211.122(g), in fact, expressly addresses ``packaging and labeling operations.''
FDA notes that it expressly directed its proposal to control a method of printing, gang printing, because the cut labeling
that necessarily results from such a method has been implicated in a number of recalls. Moreover, in the proposed rule,
FDA announced its intent to ``revise certain 

labeling

 control provisions. The changes are intended to reduce the frequency of drug product mis

labeling

.'' (54 FR 26394 (emphasis added)). Immediately following, in the summary of the proposed rule, FDA focused on the
practices targeted for control, stating ``The proposal specifies conditions for the use of gang-printed or cut 

labeling

***.'' (54 FR 26394 (emphasis added)). 
Furthermore, in the proposal, FDA described the control procedures to be used by ``

labeling

 and packaging'' lines and in proposed 211.122(g)(1), referred to one of the special control features as the
``Dedication of 

labeling

 and packaging lines to each different drug product * * *.'' (54 FR 26394 at 26395 (emphasis added)). Likewise, FDA referred
to the second special control feature in proposed 211.122(g)(2), which provides for the ``use of appropriate
electronic or electromechanical equipment to conduct a 100-percent examination for correct 

labeling

***'' (54 FR 26394 at 26395 (emphasis added)). Despite such explanations in the proposal, FDA will, nonetheless,
accept and review comments addressing the scope of 211.122(g) with respect to its application to labeling,
as that term is defined in section 201(m) of the act. 
FDA also reiterates its explanation of the terms ``cut labels'' and ``cut labeling'' in the preamble to the final rule:
```Cut labels' and `cut labeling' are 

items of labeling

 that have been detached from printed stock material prior to being brought to a labeling line***'' (58 FR 41348 at 41350
(emphasis added)). 
This partial extension of the compliance date and limited reopening of the administrative record grant, in essence,
the requests of the citizen petitions to have additional time for compliance with one aspect of the final rule, while
reserving judgment on the underlying issues pending FDA's receipt and review of any comments. Compliance with the
remainder of 211.122, including 211.122(g) as it applies to labels as that term is defined in section
201 of the act, is expected on August 3, 1994. It is important to note, however, that 211.125 makes a waiver of
labeling reconciliation conditional on a 100-percent examination for correct labeling performed in accordance
with 211.122(g)(2). 
Interested persons may on or before October 4, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments on this final rule. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one
copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
This document is issued under sections 201, 501, 502, 505, 506, 507, 512, 701, 704 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (21 U.S.C. 321, 351, 352, 355, 356, 357, 360b, 371, 374).
