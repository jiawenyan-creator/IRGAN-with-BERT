Right-Wing Parties Form `Alliance for Poland'"] 
  [Text] The process of putting the right side of the 
political spectrum in order has begun. A coalition established 
on 10 November of last year, comprising Center Accord [PC], the 
Christian-National Union, Peasant Accord, the Movement for the 
Republic, and the Conservative Coalition, formed a confederation 
called the Alliance for Poland [Przymierze dla Polski--PDP]. As 
Kazimierz Ujazdowski told journalists on 12 May, it is a 
long-lasting and coherent alliance with a stable basis. 
  The goal of the new movement is to establish a formation 
capable of replacing the governing left wing and to lay to rest 
fears of the left wing's rules for many years to come. 
According to the PDP, left-wing rules are a big waste of the 
nation's collective time. PC Chairman Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who 
will be serving in the post of confederation chairman for two 
months, stressed that the group is open to talks with other 
right-wing parties; negotiations with some of them are already 
under way. Acceptance of the principles contained in an 
ideological/program declaration is a precondition for joining 
the movement. Kaczynski stressed that it is a declaration of a 
party that is of a conservative nature and that is based on 
traditional, Catholic values that constitute the foundation of 
the group's measures. In the declaration, democracy was 
recognized as an intangible value, and the market economy and 
Poland's sovereignty were lauded. In addition, efforts to find 
a place for Poland in Western structures, including membership 
in NATO, the Western European Union, and European Union, were 
encouraged.
