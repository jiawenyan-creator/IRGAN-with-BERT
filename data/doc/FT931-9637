FT  12 FEB 93 / Letter: Daf - effectiveness of broad view and consensus from
bankruptcy
Sir, After three years of heavy losses and three agonising weeks for Daf
employees, the management called in the receivers and asked for protection
against its creditors.
It took the receivers two days to arrive at the conclusion that Daf as a
truck maker has a viable future, but only under the form of a new, leaner
company, concentrating on its core business - the design, development and
production of trucks.
The Dutch minister of economics was so impressed by the receiver's findings
that he not only agreed, but promised to support the new venture
financially. So why during three years of declining sales and losses did
Daf's own management fail to come up with a plan for restructuring, similar
to the one which the receiver managed to put together in two days?
The answer is simple. Daf management would never have been able to reach a
similar consensus, either with the unions or the government, without the
real threat of imminent bankruptcy hanging over its head.
