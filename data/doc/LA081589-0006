ART FUNDS AND CENSORSHIP 
Bogosian's defense of NEA against the tirades of Helms misses the point. Much 
of what is funded by the NEA can and should be funded at the local level. But 
California, while second in the nation in the number of artists, ranks only 
20th in state funding of the arts. (See "Hot Line for Writers," Book Review 
Section, Aug. 6.) California taxpayers have the right to wonder why their tax 
dollars should subsidize New York artists. 
Beyond the question of funding, the NEA has sought to promote the myth of the 
avant-garde, that controversial art and artists can be encouraged with state 
funds. This amounts to moral schizophrenia, an atmosphere in which art is 
supposed to be subversive, but not offensive. Is the public ready for this? 
Well, no, not yet. Bogosian says finally that he would have no career without 
the NEA. Would he still be an artist? If the answer is yes, then he has made it 
in spite of the NEA and should be commended.
