FT  16 OCT 92 / Russian curbs lifted
The Russian government has lifted travel restrictions on all foreigners, in
a long-awaited step which removes one of the last vestiges of the Cold War
and may help encourage foreign investment, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
A government spokesman said yesterday that business people and journalists
will no longer need to give advance notice of travel plans, once they have a
visa to enter the country. They will also no longer need to show visas to
buy tickets and book accommodation, and can do this through private
organisations, by-passing traditional state monopoly organisations such as
Intourist.
