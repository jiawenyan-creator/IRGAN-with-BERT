  [Text] Wuhan, June 22 (XINHUA) -- With the approval of the 
State Planning Commission, a new highway bridge will be 
constructed across the country's biggest river, the Chiang 
Jiang, in central China's Hubei Province. 
  The construction of the bridge will bring closer the two key 
grain production areas in China -- the Jianghan plain and the 
Dongting Lake plain. At present transportation is by ferry 
across the river. 
  The four-lane bridge will be 4,015 m [meters] long and 25 m 
wide. 
  The total cost of the bridge is expected to be 1.13 billion 
yuan (about 130 million U.S. dollars). 
  Some 60 million U.S. dollars of the cost will be in the form 
of loans from Japan. 
  Construction is scheduled to start in 1995, and the bridge 
should open to traffic in 2000. 
  The bridge is named the Jingsha highway bridge as it will 
stretch from the cities of Jingzhou and Shashi and to the Gongan 
county.
