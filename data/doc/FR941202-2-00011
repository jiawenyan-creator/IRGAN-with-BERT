Case History


Since the publication of the notice of initiation in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 37028, July 20, 1994), the following events have occurred.
On August 1, 1994, we issued countervailing duty questionnaires to the Government of Italy (``GOI'') and the Commission
of the European Communities (``EC''), in Washington, D.C., concerning petitioner's allegations. On August 8, 1994,
the GOI responded to the first section of our questionnaire informing us that Dalmine S.p.A. (``Dalmine''), an Italian
OCTG producer, accounted for more than 85 percent of the Italian exports of the subject merchandise to the United States
during the POI. The GOI, the EC, and Dalmine submitted questionnaire responses on October 7, 1994. On October 18, 1994,
we issued deficiency questionnaires to these parties. We received responses from the GOI, Dalmine, and the EC on November
7, 1994.
On August 24, 1994, we postponed the preliminary determination in this investigation until November 23, 1994 (59
FR 43554, August 24, 1994).


Scope of Investigation


The products covered by this investigation are OCTG, which are hollow steel products of circular cross-section.
These products include oil well casing, tubing, and drill pipe, of iron (other than cast iron) or steel (both carbon
and allow), whether or not conforming to American Petroleum Institute (``API'') or non-API specifications, whether
finished or unfinished (including green tubes). These investigations do not cover casing, tubing, or drill pipe
containing 10.5 percent or more of chromium. The OCTG subject to these investigations are currently classified in
the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (``HTS'') under these item numbers:
