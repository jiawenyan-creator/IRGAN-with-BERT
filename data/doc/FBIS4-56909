  [Text] The government-in-exile has reacted to the change in 
the U.S. policy toward refugees. President Clinton's decision 
represents a step in the right direction, says a communique 
issued by the Haitian presidency in Washington. The text, 
however, explains that this policy is not aimed at protecting 
the millions of Haitians who continue to face political violence. 
  President Aristide explained in the communique that the 
nation is in danger and that among the numbers of Haitians who 
are fleeing repression and political violence in Haiti and who 
will be questioned on the U.S. Coast Guard ships, only a small 
percentage will be granted political asylum. 
  The communique continues... [pauses] in this communique, 
President Aristide praised the U.S. sectors that prompted 
President Clinton to change the policy toward Haitian refugees. 
At the same time, the president-in-exile stated that only his 
return to Haiti can end the refugees' problems.
