FT  05 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke active
Turnover in hotels and leisure company Ladbroke Group rose sharply on strong
two-way business as the company reported full-year figures in line with
market expectations.
The stock advanced 7 to 207p initially on the release of the figures, with
dealers particularly pleased with the slight improvement in the dividend,
from 10.93p to 11.15p.
The analysts' meeting was said, however, to have been slightly 'down beat'
and the shares went into retreat as some brokers reduced current-year profit
expectations and others focused on how much the company will make from
future property disposals.
By the market close a hefty 14m shares had been traded, with the stock
surrendering the earlier gain to close a net penny easier at 199p.
Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court, one of the group's brokers, trimmed his
current-year forecast by Pounds 10m to 180m to take account of the slow
start to the year in the DIY and hotels division.
Mr Mark Finney at NatWest Markets lowered his forecast by Pounds 9m to
Pounds 172m but moved the stock from a hold to a buy recommendation.
