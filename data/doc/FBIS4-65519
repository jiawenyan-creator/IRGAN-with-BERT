Unveiled Sunday"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 14 -- A new party calling itself a 
Liberal-Socialist "Movement" and claiming to group the remnants 
of four coalition parties that almost disappeared after 
elections in the wake of corruption scandals will be founded 
officially Sunday [15 May] in Rome. 
  Margherita Boniver of the Socialist Party, who is among the 
founders of the new body, on Saturday claimed the 
Liberal-Socialist "thing" will be a "political subject...not a 
party but a cultural political movement" which will include 
members of the Liberal, Republican and Social Democratic parties. 
  "Many parties, like the Socialist Party, have disappeared, 
but that does not mean their heritage of ideas must also be 
lost," she said, adding that the movement will place itself 
"left of center" and will adopt as its slogan and official 
magazine the phrase, "don't give up." The magazine (NON 
MOLLARE) already exists and was founded in 1925.
