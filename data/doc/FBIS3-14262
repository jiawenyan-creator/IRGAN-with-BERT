  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has praised the fraternal 
ties between Jordan and the State of Qatar. He voiced pride in 
the brotherhood that binds them, ties that have long existed on 
a very strong basis and on frankness and concern for joint Arab 
interests. 
  In statements to Qatari media today, his majesty expressed 
happiness on his visit to Qatar and for being at the side of his 
brother, his highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani. He 
voiced confidence that relations between the two countries, 
which are built on the strongest of bases, will last, God 
willing. His majesty said: Our aim is to serve and carry out 
our duties toward generations that will come after us throughout 
the Arab homeland. The king alluded to the current difficult 
circumstances and serious challenges. His majesty described 
this visit as part of the efforts aimed at realizing Arab 
solidarity and prosperity for the entire Arab nation. 
  On the call for holding an Arab summit at this stage, His 
Majesty King Husayn said: We have hoped for a very long time to 
hold an Arab summit so that the brother leaders can meet and 
talk frankly on their problems in order to serve their nation's 
present and future. He noted that His Highness Shaykh Khalifah 
Bin-Hamad Al Thani, the amir of the State of Qatar, has the same 
desire and hope. The king explained that the date for such a 
summit is left to us and to all the brothers. 
  On the U.S. statements that united Jerusalem will be the 
capital of Israel, his majesty said: Jerusalem is the city we 
hold to be sacred in our hearts, consciences, and minds and 
sovereignty over Jerusalem can only belong to Almighty God. 
  His majesty prayed for God to grant the Arab and Muslim 
leaders success to enable them to play their role and carry out 
their duties and keep Jerusalem for their Islamic nation and the 
believers in God in the place in which it should be.
