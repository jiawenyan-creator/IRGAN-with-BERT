  [Text] Nouakchott, Jan 20 (AFP) -- The head of the 
Mauritanian Association for Human Rights, which is unrecognised 
by the authorities, has been arrested for alleged incitement to 
agitation, an informed source said Friday [21 January]. 
  Sheikh Sadibou Camara, who is also a member of the executive 
of the opposition Union for Democracy and Progress (UDP), is 
accused of saying that descendants of former slaves whose 
parents had lost trace of them had been sold. 
  Under Mauritanian law any reference to a return to the 
country's traditional practice of slavery is considered 
prejudicial to national unity and banned. 
  The UDP for its part said Camara's arrest Thursday followed 
contacts he had with the human rights organisation Agir Ensemble 
(Act Together) in condemning the conduct of the campaign for 
municipal elections on January 28.
