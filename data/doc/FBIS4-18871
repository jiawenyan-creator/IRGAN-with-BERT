  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, of the 
Free Democratic Party of Germany, is banking on Russia to bring 
its influence to bear on the Serbian side to "stop the terrible 
attacks against Gorazde." Otherwise, NATO might be forced to 
carry out further air strikes, the minister said in an interview 
on West German Radio WDR on Monday [11 April]. It is of utmost 
importance for Gorazde as a peace symbol not to fall finally 
into Serbian hands. The special Russian delegate, Vitaliy 
Churkin, was in the region, and he "knows exactly what is at 
stake," Kinkel said. 
  The operation of the two U.S. NATO combat aircraft has been 
fully supported by the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. 
Hans-Ulrich Klose, chairman of the SPD Bundestag group, said on 
Saarland Radio that the air strike was a "right step," because 
the United Nations did not have any other opportunity any more. 
Karsten Voigt, foreign-policy spokesman for the SPD Bundestag 
group, confirmed that the air strike was "unfortunately 
inevitable." The Young Social Democrats were of the opposite 
opinion. Heiko Kretschmer, deputy spokesman for the SPD's youth 
organization, described the air strike as proof of NATO's 
failure.
