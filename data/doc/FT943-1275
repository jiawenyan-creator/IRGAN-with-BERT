FT  24 SEP 94 / Fashion: Off-the-cuff tales of men's shirts - John Rink
John Rink, managing partner at Allan and Overy, City solicitors: 'I shop for
myself because I know what I want and my wife, who works, has no time. I go
to specialist shops such as Thomas Pink where I would expect the fabric,
finish, length and so on to be to the standard I require. Quality is more
important than price. My usual style is double-cuffed with a partly cut-away
collar, in really good, striped cotton and a comfortable fit without
bagginess. This gives the professional look clients expect and looks smart
in the office without a jacket. I don't attempt to be fashionable but ties
can make a statement. My shirts last well and are professionally ironed. I
restock when they wear out, or at sales. Shopping in the City is
convenient.'
