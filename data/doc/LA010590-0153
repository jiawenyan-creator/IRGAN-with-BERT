BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE; 
PERMITS DROP: 
Building permits for multifamily residential units -- that's apartments and 
condos in English -- dropped a hefty 30% in the county during the first 10 
months of 1989. There were 7,200 permits issued compared to 10,300 in 1988, 
according to the Construction Industry Research Board. 
That's good news for apartment owners, who have seen vacancy rates rise and 
profits decline in the last few years.
