FT  01 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy
The Bank of England's latest quarterly bulletin sheds light on the slow
growth of investment so far in the upturn. Investment by companies is
certainly growing more slowly than during previous upturns - 1.7 per cent
last year against 2.4 per cent in 1982. But spending held up unusually well
during the recession. As the chart shows, investment as a percentage of
gross domestic product is now much higher than in the early 1980s.
Investment through recession also weakened company balance sheets. On a
replacement cost basis, capital gearing across the economy is not far below
the peak reached in 1992.
But while that might discourage some companies from investing, the bigger
barrier is uncertainty about the economic prospects. The Bank's straw poll -
taken in March - found that companies were unwilling to increase investment
without firm evidence of rising demand. Similarly, only 30 per cent of
companies had lowered their hurdle rates of return for new investment to
take account of low inflation. Corporate Britain is clearly sceptical about
the promise of stable, low-inflationary growth.
Such a conclusion tallies with surveys by the Confederation of British
Industry. It is also consistent with strong investment during recession:
companies usually demand a lower rate of return from investments in
efficiency rather than capacity. The outlook for growth is less clouded than
when the Bank took its poll, so the emphasis may slowly switch towards
increasing productive capacity. If the government wants companies to lower
hurdle rates, though, it still has something to prove on inflation.
