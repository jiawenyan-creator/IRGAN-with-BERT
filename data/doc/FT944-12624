FT  01 NOV 94 / Mayhew acts over 'IRA roadblock'
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday called for a
report from the Royal Ulster Constabulary on reports that armed and masked
men purporting to be from the IRA mounted checkpoints on roads in
Londonderry at the weekend, Stewart Dalby writes.
If the reports are true they could have a bearing on the timing of talks
between British government officials and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
wing, on how Sinn Fein might enter peace negotiations.
However, the RUC said: 'We have only had one anonymous phone call saying he
saw someone with a gun. Several people said they saw masked men. But we are
now inclined to think this was the work of Hallowe'en pranksters.'
