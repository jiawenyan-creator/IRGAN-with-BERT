FT  16 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Venturers address return
to lender - In a nutshell
The British venture capital industry produces voluminous statistics about
its activities but has not until now published the numbers that most
interest its investors: those which show the returns on its investments.
Faced with increasing pressure from the institutions which have had to
accept disappointing returns, the British Venture Capital Association is to
carry out a pilot study to gather performance statistics.
The association will gather information on individual investments by six
members to see whether a pattern emerges from investments made in a
particular year or type of deal. It may also look at the returns from
investments by industry.
The data will not be used to compare the performance of different venture
capital funds however, a prospect which worries many venture capitalists.
