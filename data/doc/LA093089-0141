LOARA'S GROUND GAME RUNS DOWN MAGNOLIA 
Loara High School might be called too one-dimensional, but that's fine by Coach 
Herb Hill. 
"I'll take a win any way I can get it," Hill said. "We'll face reality next 
week when we play El Modena." 
This week, the Saxons' first priority was to establish the run, which they did 
effectively and early in a 38-0 victory over Magnolia Friday night at Handel 
Stadium. 
Loara senior tailback Coy Collins rushed for 194 yards in 17 carries, and 
scored four of the team's six touchdowns. 
The Saxons gained 387 yards rushing, using nine ballcarriers. 
"We wanted to run tonight," Hill said. "The running game is our thing, but you 
do have to have some balance." 
But the Saxons (4-0) were not exactly balanced. They completed only one of two 
passes for six yards. A third attempt resulted in a pass-interference penalty. 
Defensively, the Saxons also dominated Magnolia (0-4). Quarterback Elliot 
Parker had three passes intercepted and was sacked four times. DENNIS KAISER
