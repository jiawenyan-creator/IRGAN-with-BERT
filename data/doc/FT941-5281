FT  08 MAR 94 / German public service workers in token strikes
Several thousand German public service workers took part in token strikes
yesterday, to keep up pressure for a new pay offer. The workers are calling
for a 4 per cent rise to match inflation. The OTV public sector trade union
has rejected a pay freeze, but there were hints yesterday that a low wage
award might be combined with measures to secure jobs, as in the weekend
agreement reached by engineering workers. Mr Heinz Schleusser, finance
minister of North Rhine-Westphalia and chief negotiator on behalf of the 16
federal states, said a 2 per cent pay award from next January 1 might be
possible - ensuring a pay freeze in 1994. The union is seeking shorter
working hours, as an alternative to redundancies, in the face of public
service budget cuts. But it wants 50 per cent compensation for the loss of
earnings, which would push up hourly wage rates, although cutting overall
wages. The employers are insisting on a pay freeze, further cuts in fringe
benefits, and improved working flexibility. Talks affecting 3.5m public
sector workers re-open tomorrow.
