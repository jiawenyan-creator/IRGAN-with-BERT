FT  19 MAY 93 / Letter: An ode to social class
Sir, I have just read your excellent article, 'Victim of class action' (May
15). With all the talk about class and classlessness, I feel utterly
confused, and haven't the foggiest idea what, if any, class I am.
But perhaps my late father summed it up perfectly in a poem he used to
recite: 'There were two moles of equal worth; but not it seems of equal
birth. The one who said his blood was blue, was much the bloodiest of the
two'.
