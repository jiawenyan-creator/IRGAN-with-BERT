FT  12 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Big share placing in GUS
A large placing in Great Universal Stores saw the group recording its
highest ever daily share turnover. Smith New Court was believed to have
bought a line of 13m shares for an undisclosed price from one institution
and placed them at 610p. Dealers said the shares were sold to a number of
institutions. At the end of yesterday's session the stock had retreated 6 to
620p with turnover reaching 19m.
Initially, analysts were worried that the seller was the Wolfson Foundation,
the charitable body that controlled the group until its recent share
restructuring, and which still holds an 8.6 per cent stake.
Any such move could have affected how GUS dealt with its large cash pile -
estimated at Pounds 1.7bn for the year to March 1994. There have been hopes
that the company will launch a share buy-back scheme.
