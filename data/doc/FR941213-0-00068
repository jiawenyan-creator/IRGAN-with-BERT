Final rule.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission modifies its rules pertaining to three aspects of auction design for the broadband PCS auctions: Procedures
triggering the close of an auction, timing of the auctions for the entrepreneurs' blocks, and anti-collusion rules.
These actions are intended to speed the conclusion of the auctions, thus facilitating rapid introduction of service
to the public; to improve the administrative efficiency of the auction process; and to foster competition and widespread
participation in the auctions.

I. Introduction



1. By this action, we reconsider, on our own motion, decisions made in the Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order in this
proceeding, which addressed petitions for reconsideration of the Fifth Report and Order concerning auction design
and procedures for the auction of licenses to provide personal communications services in the 2 GHz band (``broadband
PCS'').
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In light of our experience in the national and regional narrowband PCS license auctions, we find it desirable to modify
our rules pertaining to three aspects of auction design for the broadband PCS auctions: procedures triggering the
close of an auction, timing of the auctions for the entrepreneurs' blocks, and anti-collusion rules.

II. Stopping Rules



2. In the Fifth Report and Order we stated that a simultaneous multiple round auction with a simultaneous stopping
rule will close when a single round has passed in which there is no new acceptable bid on any license and no activity rule
waiver is submitted.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 In the Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order we allowed for two types of activity rule waivers, ``proactive'' waivers,
which will keep an auction open in a round in which no new valid bids are submitted, and ``automatic'' waivers, which
will not keep an auction open.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 We also reaffirmed our decision to use a simultaneous stopping rule, which holds bidding open on all licenses until
no new acceptable bid is offered on any license.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 These same rules were applied in the regional and national narrowband auctions. The nationwide narrowband PCS auction
(with 10 licenses) was completed after 47 rounds of bidding, and the regional narrowband PCS auction (with 30 licenses)
took 105 rounds to complete. In the broadband PCS auctions 99 MTA licenses will be auctioned in the first auction and
a total of 1,972 BTA licenses in subsequent auctions. Although the number of rounds to complete a simultaneous multiple
round auction is not necessarily directly proportional to the number of licenses put up for bid, we are concerned that,
without changes in procedures, it may take an excessively long period of time to conduct these auctions, thus creating
a significant delay in providing service to the public.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Thus our recent experience with simultaneous multiple round auctions suggests that the Commission should consider
additional measures to ensure that future auctions are completed within a reasonable period of time.

3. We believe that retaining the discretion to keep an auction open even if no new acceptable bids and no proactive waivers
are submitted will allow the Commission to complete the broadband PCS auctions in a timely manner without sacrificing
efficiency or revenue. Providing the auction staff with the discretion to keep an auction open will permit the Commission
to use larger minimum bid increments early in the auction (to move the auction along quickly) without incurring the
risk that the auction will close while some bidders are willing to pay significantly more for certain licenses than
the current high bid but not more than the relatively large minimum bid increments. The Commission will be able to permit
additional bidding at lower bid increments subsequent to a round with no bids, thereby increasing the likelihood
that licenses will be awarded to the bidders that value them most highly and facilitating efficient aggregations
of licenses.

4. Retaining the discretion to keep an auction open will also allow the Commission to continue to accept bids on a license
for which a bid was withdrawn late in an auction, especially in the last round of an auction. Without the option of keeping
an auction open, a license for which a bid was withdrawn in the last round would have to be put up for bid in a subsequent
auction.

5. Accordingly, we retain the discretion to keep an auction open even if no new acceptable bids and no proactive waivers
are submitted in a single round. Under this minor modification of our procedures, the Commission would in essence
have the ability to submit its own proactive waiver, thus keeping the auction open. This rule modification will facilitate
the rapid completion of future auctions because it will permit the Commission to use larger bid increments, which
speed the pace of the auction, without risking a premature auction close.
