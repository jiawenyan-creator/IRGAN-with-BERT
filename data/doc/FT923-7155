FT  19 AUG 92 / Writ over home-income plans
A GROUP of 27 elderly investors who bought home-income plans through
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society have issued a writ against the
society asking for mortgages with it to be set aside and for payment for
distress and suffering.
Mr Peter Stafford, of Harrison Clark, the Worcester firm of solicitors which
issued the writ, said he expected a further 160 investors to add their names
to the writ when it came before the High Court.
'This is the first multi-party action arising from a home-income plan and we
expect that it will arouse considerable interest,' Mr Stafford said.
The claims arise from the collapse of Aylesbury Associates, a firm of
financial advisers which offered a plan for elderly people to borrow against
the value of their homes and invest the proceeds in equity-linked bonds. The
bonds were intended to provide income as well as to service the loan. When
the scheme collapsed, investors were left with large debts and some had to
sell their homes.
Former clients of the scheme can claim up to Pounds 48,000 from the
Investors Compensation Scheme, and C&amp;G has promised some top-up payments for
investors if they qualify under ICS rules, although it denies liability and
says investors got into trouble because of advice by Aylesbury.
The society said yesterday that it had not yet received the writ from
Harrison Clark and could not comment on it. 'We have done everything we can
and it is up to the ICS to start payments,' it said. 'We don't see what
serving a writ will do to speed up the ICS payments.'
