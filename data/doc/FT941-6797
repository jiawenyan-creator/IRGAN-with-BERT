FT  28 FEB 94 / International Company News: Danish bank back in surplus
Den Danske Bank, Denmark's largest bank, returned to profit with net
earnings of DKr2.40bn (Dollars 359m) last year after a 1992 loss of
DKr1.73bn. An unchanged DKr12 dividend was proposed, writes Hilary Barnes in
Copenhagen.
The result is in line with market expectations. Earnings last year were
lifted by the value adjustment of the portfolio of bonds, shares and foreign
exchange, which added DKr2.42bn to group profits, against a negative
DKr1.68bn.
But the bank said after eliminating this item, earnings from 'basic banking
business', including bad loss provisions, were up to DKr1.98bn from DKr642m
in 1992, helped by a DKr500m reduction in costs to DKr6.01bn.
Loss provisions remained high at DKr2.83bn, a fall of just DKr100m from
1992.
The bank forecast a further improvement in earnings in 1994 from basic
banking business, with a continued reduction in costs.
