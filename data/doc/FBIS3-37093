  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS 9/2/1994 -- Russia will deliver 
to Moldova "special technique and other types of production for 
needs of defence and security," as stipulated in the 
Moldo-Russian Agreement on Economic and Commercial Collaboration 
for 1994, signed on 7 February in Moscow. The Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations and the State Stock Company 
"Oboronpromkomplex" of Russia, and the Moldovan Defence Ministry 
are authorized to perform such imports. Deliveries of "military 
equipment will be legalized by a separate protocol (agreement) 
and made on the basis of reciprocity (clearing)," states the 
document. It is stressed that these commercial exchanges are 
free of customs taxes, Ion Mastac, head of Moldovan Defence 
Ministry Press Secretariat, told BASAPRESS that previously a 
meeting was planned between representatives of both states' 
ministries, in order to sign an agreement on deliveries of 
equipment. However, these deliveries do not include any 
weaponry, said Mastac. Sources from the Ministry of Commerce 
and Material Resources said "we import absolutely everything the 
Army needs, from cloth to technical means," without specifying 
what sort of technique. Same sources inform that an agreement 
on these deliveries was signed, but once the State Company 
"Oboronpromkomplex" was created, imports were stopped. A 
division at the Ministry of Commerce and Material Resources is 
specialized in imports of equipment for needs of state defence 
and security.
