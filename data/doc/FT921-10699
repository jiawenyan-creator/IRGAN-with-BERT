FT  05 FEB 92 / Observer: On your honour
If Kung Fu movie king Sir Run Run Shaw can get an honorary degree from
Oxford University, why can't Margaret Thatcher?
Oxford University insists that its reason for conferring the honorary degree
of doctor of civil law on the 84-year-old Hong Kong billionaire is not that
he has pledged Pounds 10m for an Institute of Chinese Studies. Rather it is
rewarding him for his service to the community - mainly charitable - already
recognised by his knighthood.
Quite so. But Observer wonders whether the university would rethink its
opposition to granting an honorary degree to Britain's ex-premier if she
were to move her Thatcher foundation's headquarters to Oxford, or at least
direct some of its largesse in that direction.
