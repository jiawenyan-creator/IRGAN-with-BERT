VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: GROUP TO LAUNCH CITYHOOD PETITION 
A group representing the unincorporated community of Oak Park plans to launch a 
petition drive for cityhood on Monday, an official said Tuesday. 
Members of the Oak Park Municipal Advisory Council are looking for volunteers 
to gather signatures in support of forming the new city, said Ron Stark, a 
member of the council. 
A majority of the council members say they want to create a city, which would 
have local control over land use and development around Oak Park. 
The five-member Municipal Advisory Council merely acts as an adviser to the 
County Board of Supervisors. 
Cityhood supporters must collect signatures of about 25% of the registered 
voters. There are about 4,500 registered voters, said Duane Skavdahl, another 
member of the council. PSYCHE PASCUAL
