FT  26 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: HK bank faces spin-off
INTERNATIONAL Bank of Asia (IBA), the Hong Kong retail bank which is part of
the Bahrain-based Arab Banking Corporation (ABC), is to be spun off via a
HKDollars 598m public offer in Hong Kong.
ABC has recently sold 20 per cent of IBA to the state-owned China Everbright
for about HKDollars 440m.
After the Hong Kong public offer, ABC will own 55 per cent of the bank, one
of the largest in Hong Kong with 20 branches.
Net earnings over the past five years have risen at a compound rate of 35
per cent. Net profit this year is forecast to increase by 16 per cent to
HKDollars 166m.
The company is offering 159m new shares at HKDollars 3.76 a share. Proceeds
will help fund expansion of the group's retail operations in Hong Kong.
The link-up with China Everbright is expected to expand IBA's presence in
China.
