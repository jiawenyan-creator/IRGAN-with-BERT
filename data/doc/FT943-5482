FT  03 SEP 94 / International Company News: MCI pull-out fails to dampen
Nextel project
Nextel Communications is to press ahead with its plans to build a US-wide
wireless communications system, despite MCI's decision not to collaborate in
the venture, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco.
Nextel said yesterday it had Dollars 2.1bn in cash and commitments toward
the estimated Dollars 2.5bn needed to establish a system covering 85 per
cent of the US population by March 1997.
MCI, the US long-distance telephone company, was to have acquired a 17 per
cent stake in Nextel for Dollars 1.3bn and become a marketing partner,
lending its well-recognised name to Nextel's wireless communications
services.
Earlier this week, MCI called off the agreement, but talks continued aimed
at forming a strategic alliance.
MCI said the new talks had been positive. However, any new deal would
require Motorola's consent, and MCI and Motorola were unable to reach
agreement on terms. Motorola earlier agreed to sell Nextel all of its
special mobile radio licences for Dollars 1.7bn in stock.
