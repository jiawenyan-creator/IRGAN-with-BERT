  [Text] The Democratic Labor Party (PDT)'s preliminary 
government program is as follows: 
<H5>  Economy </H5>
  To defeat inflation by moralizing public finances, reversing 
international losses, and radically reformulating the domestic 
debt that enslaves the government to financial interests. 
  To stop international losses by reversing the transfer 
abroad 
of the net national capital flow. 
  To negotiate the foreign debt by making the interest rate 
fixed and attributing to the remaining debt an intermediate 
value situated between the nominal value and the value 
recognized in the secondary market. To subordinate the debt 
payment to the domestic economy's growth by eliminating 
speculative increases. 
  To promote auditing of the domestic debt by ascertaining 
responsibility for irregular contracting and irregular use of 
the debt with criminal accountability, whenever appropriate. 
  In the use of the exchange reserves, to give priority to the 
importation of capital goods required for updating industry and 
by not allowing these reserves to be squandered in servicing the 
foreign debt. 
  To reduce illegal currency evasion. 
<H5>  Minimum Wage </H5>
  To reinstate the minimum wage's purchasing power, based on 
studies conducted by the Interunion Department for Statistics 
and Socioeconomic Studies that indicate that the minimum wage's 
purchasing power should be $350. 
<H5>  Electoral Reform </H5>
  To implement public financing of electoral campaigns, thus 
fighting economic influences to break down the oligarchic clique 
that controls power. 
  Financial System 
  To reform the financial system by recovering the public 
indebtedness capacity and making savings-attracting and savings- 
investing instruments more adequate for the productive sector's 
long-term financing needs. 
<H5>  Agrarian Reform </H5>
  To give land to 20 million people by settling communities in 
areas neighboring secondary roads and by making use of the 
agricultural districts nuclei to create "rural cities." 
<H5>  Education </H5>

  Full-day schooling with four meals ensured per day. To 
receive at the Integrated Public Education Centers, on an 
emergency and temporary basis, poor or abandoned children from 
six to 14. 
  To organize mandatory elementary education in five years. 
The 
students' grading will be done throughout the period without the 
dreaded possibility of repeating the year, which so inhibits 
those students coming from a meeker strata of society. To have 
five years of high school education and two more years of 
university-level studies and/or two years [as published]. 
<H5>  Communication </H5>
  No one nor any group will be able to control more than 30 
percent of the social communications system in one state or the 
country. 
  No one nor any group can own a radio station, newspaper, 
magazine, or television channel at the same time. 
  Forty percent of the television programs must be produced 
locally -- 30 percent by independent producers, and only 30 
percent in national network. 
  To review the distribution of official funds allocated to 
publicity through a compensatory system that is not only 
commercial. 
  Open new credit lines for the creation of a new 
communications system in the country. The BNDES [National Bank 
for Economic and Social Development] does not make loans to 
printed communication companies compromising democratic 
plurality. 
  Stimulate research and the use of new technologies to 
produce 
and recycle paper in order to revitalize this market that is 
being threatened by external cost fluctuations. 
<H5>  Taxes </H5>
  Maintain and strengthen the goods and services distribution 
tax. 
  Create three other direct taxes: a tax on personal 
consumption (replacing the IR [income tax] and affecting the 
difference between income, savings, and investments), an assets 
tax, and a tax on the hereditary or gratuitous transfer of 
assets (inheritances, donations).
