THE RIGHT THING 
It is not hard to understand why the Young Americans for Freedom see both the 
government and business interests as enemies of the people. 
The HUD scandal is just one example where big business, and big government, 
under the guise of being "custodians of the poor," conspire to feed at the 
public trough. 
I am still a Republican, so as to remain socially acceptable. However, a large 
part of my heart and mind goes out to the Young Americans for Freedom, as I 
become increasingly disgusted and disillusioned by the liberal values of our 
society.
