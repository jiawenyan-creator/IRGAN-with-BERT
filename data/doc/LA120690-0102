SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ARCADIA; 
AGENCY BUYS RAILROAD LAND 
The Arcadia Redevelopment Agency has approved paying $1.1 million for land 
owned by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. 
The agency Tuesday voted unanimously to buy the property, at 21 N. 2nd Ave., 
including a small portion of land north of Wheeler Avenue, abutting the 
railroad tracks. The agency also agreed to pay the railroad up to $5,000 for 
removing a side track connected to the main track. 
Councilman Robert C. Harbicht said the agreement ends what he called a 
"friendly condemnation" process to acquire the 1.1 acres. The property falls 
under the city's Northwest Corner Project redevelopment area, which will be 
used to build a commercial center.
