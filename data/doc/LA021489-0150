DELTA ROCKET LAUNCHES SATELLITE 
A new Air Force Delta 2 rocket successfully boosted a $65-million navigation 
satellite into orbit today in an apparently flawless maiden flight marking the 
debut of a revitalized post-Challenger military space program. 
Under a clear blue sky, the 126-foot, $30-million rocket roared to life and 
majestically climbed away from launch complex 17A at the Cape Canaveral Air 
Force Station adjacent to NASA's Kennedy Space Center, 48 hours behind schedule 
because of bad weather Sunday. 
Twenty-five minutes after blastoff, the satellite was safely deployed in its 
planned preliminary orbit, an Air Force spokesman said. If all goes well, an 
on-board rocket will fire later this week to circularize the orbit at an 
altitude of 12,500 miles.
