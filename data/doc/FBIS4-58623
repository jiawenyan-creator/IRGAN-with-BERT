  [Text] India has conveyed its disappointment at the Iranian 
ambassador's statement after his visit to Jammu and Kashmir. 
The ambassador, Mr. (Reza Sheikh Akhtar), was summoned to the 
foreign office in New Delhi to convey India's reaction to his 
statement. An External Affairs Ministry spokesman said in New 
Delhi that it was not the Jammu and Kashmir government which put 
any hurdle but the Hurriyat Conference leaders themselves in 
arranging a meeting with the Iranian ambassador. He said the 
European troika ambassadors and others, who visited the state, 
appreciated India's transparent policy on Kashmir and their 
reaction was positive.
