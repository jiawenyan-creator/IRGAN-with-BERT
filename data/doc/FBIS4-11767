  [Text] PLO leader 'Arafat has appointed Mustafa al-Natshah 
as mayor of Hebron effective 4 April. Al-Natshah was voted into 
office as mayor of Hebron in 1983, but was prevented by Israeli 
authorities from carrying out his duties because of allegations 
that he encouraged attacks against settlers. Two years ago, 
al-Natshah served as a negotiator at the Washington peace talks 
with Israel. 
  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] says it opposes the 
appointment, and if al-Natshah accepts, he will be assassinated.
