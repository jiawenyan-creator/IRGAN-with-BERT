ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH 
COLLECTOR'S ITEM: Despite being tossed out of the CIF playoffs again (A1), 
Huntington Beach High won't be forgotten at tonight's game at Fontana High. . . 
. The 1,500 game programs, printed before Thursday's ruling, contain the 
Huntington Beach roster and team description. . . . They also include the same 
for Fountain Valley High, the team that actually will play. Fontana Coach John 
MacKinney said that was the only solution when, at printing deadline, "all we 
knew was we were playing Friday night against somebody wearing a white jersey."
