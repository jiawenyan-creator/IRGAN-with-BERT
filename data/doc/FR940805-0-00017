 

The FAA has determined through testing that current non-localizer type, non-precision instrument approaches developed
using the TERPS criteria can be flown by aircraft equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment. In consideration
of the above, the applicable Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) will be altered to include ``or GPS''
in the title without otherwise reviewing or modifying the procedure. Because of the close and immediate relationship
between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs
are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists
for making some SIAPs effective in less than 30 days. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
