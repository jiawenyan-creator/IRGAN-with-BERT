  [Text] Defense Minister Yeo Ning Hong believes that the 
ASEAN regional forum could provide an important mechanism to 
ensure peace and stability in the region. In an interview with 
JANE'S DEFENSE WEEKLY, Dr. Yeo said Singapore could use the 
forum to develop an understanding with countries who have an 
interest in the region. Eighteen countries are scheduled to hold 
the forum in an overall session in July in Bangkok. Dr. Yeo 
said members are likely to discuss confidence-building measures 
and a more open approach to armament and arms control.
