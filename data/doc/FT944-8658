FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Notebook computers side helps
Dell increase sales 17% in term
Dell Computer, the US personal computer manufacturer, reported improved
third-quarter results following its re-entry into the market for notebook
computers and a renewed focus on 'direct' sales via mail order and
telephone.
Sales increased 17 per cent to Dollars 885m from Dollars 757m in the same
period last year. Net income for the quarter was up sharply at Dollars
41.4m, or 93 cents a share, from Dollars 12m, or 26 cents, last time.
Notebook computers represented 9 per cent of worldwide computer sales, up
from 5 per cent in the second quarter. Dell also reported strong sales of
desktop PCs based on Intel's high performance Pentium microprocessor, which
represented 32 per cent of sales in the quarter.
Third-quarter sales also benefited from a seasonal increase in US government
sales, which typically decline in the fourth quarter, the company said.
However, revenues from Europe and large US accounts are expected to offset
the decline, said Mr Thomas Meredith, chief financial officer.
Noting that competitive pricing pressures are intense, Mr Dell said that the
company 'may choose not to take advantage of every opportunity for
incremental revenue in order to deliver steady and sustainable results'.
Gross profit margins declined sequentially from 21.4 per cent of sales in
the second quarter to 20.5 per cent of sales.
However, operating expenses dropped to 13.8 per cent of sales, versus 15 per
cent in the second quarter.
Although earnings were above Wall Street expectations of about 87 cents per
share, Dell's share price declined to close at Dollars 44 3/4 compared with
Wednesday's close of Dollars 46 1/16 .
For the year to date Dell reported revenues of Dollars 2.44bn, up from
Dollars 2.13bn in the same period last year. Net earnings were Dollars 82m,
or Dollars 2.10 a share against a loss of Dollars 55.1m, or Dollars 1.48.
