CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; 
SHOPTALK; 
ARTFUL GIFTS 
IF A TRIP to New York City isn't on your agenda, you can still visit one of its 
famous landmarks -- right here. 
Two new Metropolitan Museum of Art shops, to be opened early in November, will 
offer items previously available to Southern Californians by mail-order only. 
Some are reproductions of the Metropolitan's original works of art, and often 
the same techniques and materials used to create the originals are employed 
with these for-sale reproductions, as illustrated by the Victorian glass candy 
cane ornaments (pictured). All profits are channeled back to the museum. 
 South Coast Plaza, 3333 Bristol St., Costa Mesa, (714) 435-2000; Century City 
Shopping Center, 10250 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 277-3898.
