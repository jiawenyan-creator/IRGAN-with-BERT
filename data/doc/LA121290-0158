END TO S. AFRICA VIOLENCE URGED 
Rival black leaders appealed today for an end to fighting that has claimed at 
least 83 lives in five days, but declined to meet each other as they toured 
Tokoza to call for peace. 
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and Zulu leader Chief 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi separately toured different parts of Tokoza to urge 
followers to end fighting that has shattered the black township. 
But neither leader accepted invitations from the other to join their tours. 
Hundreds of heavily armed soldiers and police in armored vehicles ringed the 
township east of Johannesburg and lined the streets to ensure there was no 
violence. Police said they had no reports of incidents today after savage 
fighting Tuesday claimed at least 52 lives. 
Black factional fighting in the Johannesburg area has claimed at least 1,000 
lives since August. The fighting pits Xhosas and other blacks loyal to the ANC 
against Zulus tied to Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party. 
Buthelezi, accompanied by Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, told about 3,000 
Zulus armed with spears, knives and axes that there should be an end to 
violence. But he struck a defiant note, saying his followers had the right to 
self-defense.
