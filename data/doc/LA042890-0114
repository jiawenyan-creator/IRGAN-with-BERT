JAZZ REVIEW; 
JIMMY HEATH QUARTET AT EL CAMINO COLLEGE 
Though it was not to be expected that Jimmy Heath's Quartet would fill the 
spacious Marsee Hall at El Camino College Thursday evening, what could be 
anticipated was a program of music diversified enough to sustain the interest 
and reaffirm the reputation of the 63-year-old tenor saxophonist. 
With them were his brother Tootie on drums, Ben Brown on bass and guitarist 
Tony Purrone, who for 12 years has been a virtual adopted brother of the 
musical Heath family. 
Heath's warm tone and personal vibrato placed him in a middle ground, 
post-Dexter Gordon but pre-John Coltrane. He brought buoyancy and spirit to "On 
the Trail," "Hi Fly" and his own composition "Sassy Samba" (written 10 years 
ago and dedicated to Sarah Vaughan). 
Variety was assured through Heath's occasional use of flute or soprano sax (the 
latter most effectively on "Round Midnight"), and by the always remarkable 
facility of Purrone, one of the most underrated guitarists on the 
mainstream-modern front. 
Ben Brown played a hand-held electric bass that was almost all neck and no 
body, producing a heavy, thudding sound, though his ideas at times transcended 
the instrument's built-in handicap. He and everyone else reached a zenith of 
excitement on the Sonny Red tune "Bluesville." 
Tootie Heath, always a propulsive and sensitive drummer, displayed some 
dazzling brushwork on "Heart House." 
Jimmy Heath, now regularly active as a teacher and clinician, conducted a 
workshop for El Camino earlier in the day. The concert offered proof of the 
eloquence with which he can still practice what he preaches. LEONARD FEATHER
