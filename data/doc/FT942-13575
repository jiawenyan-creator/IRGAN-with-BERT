FT  23 APR 94 / Arts: Capriccio nearly doubles
This fine capriccio by Canaletto of the Scuola di San Marco in Venice sold
for Pounds 2,201,500 at Christie's yesterday, way above its Pounds 1.5m high
estimate. It sold to the London dealer Hazlett Gooden &amp; Fox who will put it
in stock. The chances are that it will eventually go abroad. For around two
centuries it had been in the possession of the Neave family and was sold by
the executors of the late Sir Arundel Neave. When its money from the
National Lottery starts to come through next year, the National Heritage
Fund could well attempt to keep similar paintings with strong British links
in the UK.
