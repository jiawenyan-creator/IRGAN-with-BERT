FT  15 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Assurances given for Brixton project
Sir, Considerable concern has been generated since the local elections about
the future of Brixton Challenge, particularly in relation to problems that
could arise in sustaining the council's commitment when no one political
grouping has control.
Your readers will he aware that Sir George Young wrote on May 26 to all
three political group leaders in Lambeth seeking assurances on a number of
matters. Since then all three of us have examined in detail the targets
Brixton Challenge has been set and the level of support that needs to come
from the council to ensure that those targets will be met. To make
commitments without that detailed scrutiny would have been irresponsible.
All three leaders have now written to Sir George Young to give him, as the
minister responsible, our wholehearted support to the programme for Brixton
and the specific undertakings that he sought, which should enable him to
release year two's funding.
There is no doubt that any further delays to this approval will greatly
undermine the implementation of many worthwhile projects and put at risk the
financial stability of the larger developments on the central site.
A great deal of progress has already been made in the past nine months to
consolidate the working arrangements between the board of Brixton Challenge
and the council. Despite its 'hung' situation the council experienced no
difficulty in gaining cross-party support for further fast-track measures
that will assist the speedy implementation of challenge projects.
I have no doubt that Sir George Young genuinely wishes to see Brixton
Challenge succeed. It would be tragic if the argument currently being
pursued by his Tory colleagues about the future of urban funding was to find
its first victim in Brixton.
