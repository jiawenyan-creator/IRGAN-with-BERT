BONES ARE THOSE OF GIRL LONG MISSING 
Months of detailed work by a Riverside County deputy coroner resulted in a sort 
of tragic success Tuesday when scattered bones found in a remote canyon were 
identified as those of a 7-year-old San Diego girl missing for 15 months. 
Alan Kunzman insisted on literally sifting the dirt that finally led to the 
discovery of teeth that were key to identifying the victim. And it was 
Kunzman's persistence in tracing hundreds of missing-persons reports that ended 
in the match-up with Charitie Careins, who was last seen near a Pacific Beach 
camping area. 
"I have children and I couldn't stand here and leave things undone," the deputy 
coroner said. "This little girl was a human being, and there is no reason to 
allow a heavy schedule to allow her to be put in a block and forgot about." 
Dental records matched against nine teeth found in San Timoteo Canyon, off 
California 60 about 120 miles northeast of San Diego, led to the 
identification, Kunzman said. 
The cause of death is unknown, but Kunzman said the discovery of seven 
fractured ribs indicates that the girl suffered severe trauma. Although an 
exact time of death has not been determined, Kunzman said the condition of the 
bones -- no traces of tissue were discovered -- indicates the girl most likely 
died soon after she was reported missing on Aug. 6, 1988. 
Events leading to the identification began June 25, when two hikers in the area 
discovered a human skull, Kunzman said. Follow-up searches turned up more 
bones. However, it was not until a fourth search of the canyon, conducted by 
Kunzman in late July, that investigators found the teeth and lower jaw.
