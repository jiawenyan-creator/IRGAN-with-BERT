FT  07 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shell and BP firm on oil price
Leading oil stocks showed the way forward yesterday ahead of first quarter
figures from Shell Transport and in response to an unexpected surge in the
price of Brent crude.
The underlying oil price for May jumped a dollar to around Dollars 16.60
reflecting worries over fighting in Yemen and a raised forecast of world oil
demand from the International Energy Agency. Shell gained 11 to 732p and BP
improved 3 1/2 at 403p on exceptionally high turnover of 25m shares.
BP was further helped by an improved recommendation from Mr John Toalster of
SGST, a long-time seller of the stock who moved his stance from 'weak hold'
to 'hold'. Mr Toalster lifted his 1996 earnings estimate to Pounds 2.1bn
from about Pounds 1.5bn previously. BP's lead gave hope for Shell's first
quarter figures on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting the company to announce
a replacement cost figure of between Pounds 800m and Pounds 990m.
