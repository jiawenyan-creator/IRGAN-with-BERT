FULLERTON'S LEWIS WILL ATTEND ST. MARY'S 
Rashone Lewis, Fullerton College's leading scorer and rebounder, said Thursday 
he will enroll next fall at St. Mary's College in Moraga, Calif. 
Lewis, a 6-foot-6 forward from Verbum Dei High School and Cal State Fullerton, 
will be eligible to play next season. 
He has two years of eligibility left. 
Lewis played sparingly last season at Cal State Fullerton and left because he 
thought he should have played more. He transferred to Fullerton College last 
fall and is averaging 20.5 points and nine rebounds a game this season. 
Lewis will play for Paul Landreaux, who is in his first year as coach at St. 
Mary's. Landreaux was an assistant at UCLA last season and before that the head 
coach at El Camino College. 
"I just wanted to play for a good program," Lewis said. "Coach Landreaux has 
the program going in the right direction, and I feel like I can play there."
