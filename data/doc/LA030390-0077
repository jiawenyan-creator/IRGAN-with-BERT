MORGAN RECEIVES PASSPORT, CAN GO TO NEW ZEALAND 
An appeals court Friday returned to Dr. Elizabeth Morgan the passport it had 
seized 3 1/2 years ago, allowing her to travel to New Zealand to participate in 
an international custody fight for her daughter. 
The District of Columbia Court of Appeals turned over the passport to Morgan a 
day after a lower court judge, who had jailed Morgan for more than two years 
for contempt of court, ruled that releasing the passport "is in the best 
interests of the minor child." 
Morgan, a plastic surgeon, was not available for comment. Her attorney, Adrian 
Roe, refused to comment. 
But Morgan had said earlier that, if her passport were returned, she would 
immediately travel to Christchurch, New Zealand, for the next phase of a 
custody fight for her daughter, Hilary, 7. 
Hilary's father, Eric Foretich, 47, a Virginia oral surgeon, is already in New 
Zealand trying to gain custody of the child. 
Morgan, 42, contends that Foretich sexually abused Hilary, a charge he has 
repeatedly denied. 
Hilary surfaced last week in New Zealand, where she has been living in 
Christchurch since 1988 with her maternal grandparents, William and Antonia 
Morgan.
