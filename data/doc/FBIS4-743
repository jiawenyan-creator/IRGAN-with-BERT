  [Text] Channel Africa reported this morning that the 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] has elected Afonso 
Dhlakama, its leader, as Renamo candidate in the presidential 
elections scheduled for October. Quoting the Renamo secretary 
general, Channel Africa reported that the decision was made at 
the minicongress being held at the Renamo headquarters in 
Maringue. 
  The source said that Dhlakama's candidacy was unanimously 
approved by all attending the meeting. Renamo's congress, which 
was scheduled to wind up today, is now focusing on issues 
relating to electoral strategy and it could last longer than 
initially expected.
