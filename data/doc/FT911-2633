FT  29 APR 91 / International Company News: Overseas sales help lift
Stefanel to L36.1bn
STEFANEL, the Italian clothing manufacturer, raised group net profits by
33.7 per cent to L36.1bn (Dollars 27.9m), thanks to a 41 per cent jump in
sales to L434.2bn from L308bn in 1989.
The rise, which follows difficult years for Italy's second biggest casual
clothing group after its flotation in October 1987, has prompted a L10
increase in the dividend to L140 a share.
However, the rises in both net earnings and the dividend remain below
company predictions in November, when it said net profits would reach about
L38bn for 1990, while the dividend would be L150.
In volume terms, sales last year rose to 12.8m items from 9.3m in 1989, with
foreign markets playing an increasingly important role.
Stefanel has been particularly active in increasing its presence in eastern
Europe, where it is represented in Hungary, Yugoslavia, Poland and
Czechoslovakia.
It has also raised its profile in the Far East. This year, its Hong
Kong-based subsidiary expects to have 100 units operating in the region, 60
of them in Japan.
According to Mr Giuseppe Stefanel, chairman and managing director, sales
this year should rise to L480bn, and net group profits to L44bn.
