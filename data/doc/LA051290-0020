SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
A 14-year-old boy was in critical condition after accidentally shooting himself 
in the head Friday, police said. 
The accident occurred shortly after midnight in the 3100 block of Clay Avenue 
when Vincent Magana was displaying the revolver to friends in his home, Sgt. 
Scott Lee said. 
Witnesses told police that Magana was "showing off the gun." 
"His friends told him to put the gun away," Lee said. "Evidently, he put a 
bullet in the chamber and put the gun to his head . . . and it went off." 
Magana was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center, where he was in the 
intensive-care unit late Friday night. 
Police are trying to determine where Magana obtained the .38-caliber revolver, 
Lee said.
