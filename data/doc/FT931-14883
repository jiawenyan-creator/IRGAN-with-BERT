FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Fourth-quarter fall at J P Morgan
JP MORGAN, the blue-chip New York banking group, was hurt in the fourth
quarter by a decline in trading revenues caused by losses on mortgage-backed
securities.
Although the bank has consistently turned in results that are above the
industry average over the past year - and yesterday unveiled a 21 per cent
rise in its 1992 full-year net profits to Dollars 1.38bn - the fall in
fourth-quarter trading income triggered a drop in Morgan's share price on
Wall Street.
The share price fell by Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 62 yesterday morning after
the bank said its fourth-quarter trading result was Dollars 200m, sharply
lower than the Dollars 313m recorded in the third quarter of 1992 and below
the Dollars 245m achieved in the last quarter of 1991.
The losses in mortgage-backed securities trading also affected trading
revenues for the whole of 1992, which were Dollars 959m, down from Dollars
1.297bn the year before.
Overall net profits for the fourth quarter of 1992 rose by 11 per cent
year-on-year to Dollars 298m, well below market expectations. This
translates into earnings per share of Dollars 1.48 in the quarter, 13 cents
higher year-on-year.
Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman, said the bank's performance last year was
helped especially by corporate finance and securities underwriting
contributions. JP Morgan is one of the few US banks allowed by authorities
to enter the equities market.
Sir Dennis said there was also steady profits growth in credit-related,
investment management and operational service divisions of JP Morgan.
Earnings per share for the whole of 1992 were Dollars 6.92, compared with
Dollars 5.80 in 1991. Bad debt provisions for 1992 were just Dollars 55m, up
from Dollars 40m the year before but extremely low for a big US bank.
Return on equity was high at 22 per cent for the year and 18 per cent for
the fourth quarter. JP Morgan also added Dollars 1bn during the year to its
net equity base, which totalled Dollars 7.1bn at the end of the year.
Net interest revenues for 1992 were 15 per cent up at Dollars 224m while
corporate finance revenues rose by 32 per cent last year to Dollars 439m.
