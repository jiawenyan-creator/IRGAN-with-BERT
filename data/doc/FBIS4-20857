  [Text] Almaty, March 20 (TASS) -- On completing the 
official part of his Kazakh visit, U.S. Defence Secretary 
Willian Perry departed for the Baykonur cosmodrome from the 
Kazakh capital. 
  The secretary's visit to the cosmodrome is of a sight-seeing 
nature. However, the aims pursued by this trip are 
self-evident. The U.S. side is interested in studying Baykonur's 
possibilities with a view to U.S. participation in the use of 
its unique potential. 
  In the opinion of several local analysts, Kazakhstan tries 
to 
bring pressure on Russia by organising the U.S. defence 
secretary's visit to Baykonur. Several rounds of the 
Kazakh-Russian talks held in the recent past brought closer the 
positions of the sides. 
  However, they could not agree, for the time being, on the 
period of a lease and the amount of a lease payment. 
  Almaty believes that if the United States displays readiness 
for cooperation with the republic in the use of the cosmodrome, 
it will be possible to cut short the duration of its leasing to 
Russia and, consequently, to start earlier the establishment of 
an international space company or any other form of its 
utilisation on a multilateral basis. 
  Following the visit to Baykonur, Perry and his party will go 
to Kiev.
