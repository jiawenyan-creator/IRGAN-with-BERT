FT  27 JAN 94 / Call for unity in Zaire
France, the US and Belgium have put pressure on rival parties in Zaire to
set up a government of national unity without delay to end a long-running
political crisis, Reuter reports from Paris.
The French Foreign Ministry said in a statement yesterday that
representatives of the three western countries met in Paris on Monday to
discuss what they called 'the continuous worsening of the economic and
social situation in Zaire'.
'The worsening of the situation in Zaire, which has heavy consequences for
the population, also poses a threat to neighbouring countries,' the
statement said.
