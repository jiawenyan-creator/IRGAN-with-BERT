FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: UK unemployment breaks 3m - At a
glance
UK unemployment broke through the 3m barrier this week, for the first time
in six years. It is now 3.06m (2.99m on a seasonally adjusted basis). This
increases the social security bill for the government, and was interpreted
as making higher taxes in next month's budget more likely.
