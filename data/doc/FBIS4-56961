  [Text] Dissatisfied with the treatment it has received from 
the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and with Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso's drop in popularity, the PFL [Liberal Front 
Party] has already begun to secretly design an alternative 
strategy. The party will set a deadline for Cardoso. If the 
candidate does not "take off," the party will try to sponsor the 
candidacy of former President Jose Sarney, who would be running 
for the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. 
  Sarney believes that if the PMDB chooses Orestes Quercia it 
will be committing "electoral suicide." After the last 
Datafolha poll on 6 May -- which showed that Sarney's popularity 
was almost at the same level of that of Cardoso -- Sarney 
changed his routine as ex-president into that of a candidate on 
campaign. 
  There is an atmosphere of rebellion within the PFL. Antonio 
Carlos Magalhaes believes Cardoso has thus far "played badly" 
and "must begin talking about starvation and unemployment." The 
PSDB leadership is betting on Cardoso's recovery. This week he 
will begin touring the country.
