FT  29 AUG 92 / Debts of Pounds 50.2m found at AWD
UNSECURED creditors of AWD, the truckmaker that went into receivership two
months ago, are unlikely to receive any payment, the administrative
receivers said yesterday, Kevin Done writes.
Mr Tony Thompson, of KPMG Peat Marwick, said the AWD group of companies had
estimated total debt of Pounds 50.2m, of which Pounds 19.6m was owed to
secured creditors, Pounds 5.1m to preferential creditors and Pounds 25.5m to
trade and other creditors, including employees.
Discussions were continuing to find a buyer for the business as a going
concern. An order for trucks from Libya, that was under negotiation when AWD
went into receivership, was still being pursued.
About 500 employees have been made redundant since AWD went into
receivership, leaving a workforce of 190.
