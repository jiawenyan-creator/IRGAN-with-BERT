FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Danka advance 58% to
Pounds 21.1m
Danka Business Systems yesterday announced a 58 per cent rise in interim
pre-tax profits as the office equipment supplier continued its expansion
across the US.
The company, which is quoted in the UK but operates mainly in the US,
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 21.1m (Pounds 13.3m) on turnover up 67
per cent to Pounds 236m (Pounds 141.1m) in the six months to September 30.
The sales increase was underpinned by 17 acquisitions costing Dollars 21m
(Pounds 13m) in the first half, and organic revenue growth of 14 per cent.
Mr Mark Vaughan-Lee, chairman, said Danka now held a 2.5 per cent market
share in both the US and the UK, with the latter expected to double in the
short-term. This year the company aims to establish operations in
continental Europe and expects a 5 per cent market share within five years.
'If you are operating in Houston or London, the copier industry worldwide is
absolutely standard. We feel our formula can be carried into any area,' he
said.
Overall profit margins were maintained as the company passed on
manufacturers' price increases of about 5 per cent.
Margins on which stand at roughly 50 per cent.
Supplies and maintenance accounts for almost half of turnover and the
company claims revenue of Dollars 1,200 a month from the latest generation
of colour copiers, compared with Dollars 80 from black-and-white copiers.
Customers typically sign a one-year maintenance contract, which can be
cancelled after three months' notice.
Net interest costs rose 46 per cent to Pounds 1.83m (Pounds 1.25m).
Long-term bank loans rose 42 per cent to Pounds 62.5m (Pounds 44.2m) at
September 30, when gearing stood at 134 per cent.
Earnings per share rose to 7.5p (5.5p) and the interim dividend is 0.9p
(0.75p).
The company also announced the acquisition of American Business Equipment,
an Ohio distributor of Sharp equipment, for Dollars 7.6m satisfied by 1.62m
shares. American reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 1m on turnover of
Dollars 16m last year.
COMMENT
Danka has a consistent track record of boosting profits and turnover through
acquisitions in the fragmented US market. While the European photocopier
market is just as fragmented, few US companies have achieved growth on the
continent through acquisitions. Analysts forecast pre-tax profits ranging
from Pounds 41m to the house broker's Pounds 45m this year, but these could
fluctuate according to the strength of the dollar. The upper figure gives a
p/e of 19, which is high considering the risks of the expansion strategy.
