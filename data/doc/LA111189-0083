CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
OAKLAND; 
TEMBLOR STRETCHED, SHEARED BRIDGE BOLTS 
Dozens of thick steel bolts that connect the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge 
to its concrete towers were stretched and sheared during the Oct. 17 
earthquake, a failure more mysterious to engineers than the collapse of a 
section of the upper deck. The California Department of Transportation said the 
affected sections would be strengthened and stronger bolts added prior to the 
scheduled reopening of the span to thousands of commuters as early as Friday. 
Engineers said recent inspections discovered the bolts that were ripped from 
the foundation footings along the first one-third mile of the bridge. The 
damage, engineers said, apparently occurred because of a strong up-and-down 
movement not expected during an earthquake.
