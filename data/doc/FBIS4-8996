  [Text] According to Defense Minister Lajos Fur, the grave 
situation in Bosnia does not threaten Hungary's security. Gyula 
Horvath reports on Fur's visit to Hungarian military air traffic 
controllers. 
  [Horvath] The minister has said that from the military 
viewpoint the agreement we concluded at the beginning of 1992 
with the military leadership of Serbia and rump Yugoslavia has 
been successful. According to the direct link [name of the 
agreement], incursion into the 10-20 km border zone is 
prohibited and immediate contact must be established in the 
event of a possible border violation. This agreement has been 
working well since. 
  Therefore, should the Bosnian situation escalate even 
further, we will be able to preserve our present situation and 
security, Defense Minister Fur stressed. Answering a question, 
he noted that the AWACS planes using our country's airspace were 
only carrying out monitoring tasks and they did not assist the 
attacks by NATO aircraft.
