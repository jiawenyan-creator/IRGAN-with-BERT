FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Black &amp; Decker shares tumble on
profits warning
SHARES IN Black &amp; Decker fell sharply yesterday after the US household
equipment maker and information services company warned Wall Street not to
expect earnings growth in the third quarter.
The company blamed deterioration in European economies and other
international markets and over-capacity in the worldwide electronics
industry for its disappointing outlook.
It does not expect third-quarter earning to exceed the Dollars 12m, or 12
cents a share, earned in the second quarter of this year.
Analysts had expected Black &amp; Decker to earn at least 22 cents a share in
the third quarter, with some predictions as high as 35 cents a share. In the
1991 third quarter, the company earned 16 cents a share.
At close of trade shares in Black &amp; Decker had dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to
Dollars 16 1/8 .
Mr Nolan Archibald, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The high interest
rate environment, together with currency and trade issue throughout Europe,
continue to keep pressure on our consumer and commercial businesses during
the current quarter. Improvements in our US operations will not fully
compensate for lower sales and production volume in Europe.'
Black &amp; Decker recorded 1991 sales of Dollars 4.64bn, with international
sales contributing 44 per cent of the total.
Although analysts had taken the weak economic conditions in Europe and
Canada into account in their earnings projections, they had expected the
impact to be offset by the company's recent cost-cutting measures.
Earlier this year, Black and Decker completed a 20.7m stock offering which
allowed it to reduce interest expenses by retiring Dollars 465m in long-term
debt.
