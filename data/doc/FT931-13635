FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Christmas boost for London Scottish
A RISE in the number of families ensuring they would have a Christmas turkey
with trimmings despite the recession, helped push up pre-tax profits of
London Scottish Bank, the consumer loans and debt collection group, by 23.5
per cent.
The bank made a surplus of Pounds 3.85m in the year ended October 27 1992,
compared with Pounds 3.11m, despite a Pounds 200,000 increase in its bad
debt charge to Pounds 2.3m.
Income from Christmas hampers grew 33 per cent to Pounds 1.16m, and
commission from debt collection rose 26 per cent to Pounds 5.51m.
Mr Jack Livingstone, chairman, said the increase in hamper sales reflected a
marketing drive, and the fact that customers wanted to make sure of their
Christmas lunch.
'People feel the need for security in a recession,' he said.
Consumers buy hampers by making weekly contributions to a collector from the
start of the year. The business was originally concentrated around
Manchester and Leeds, but has been spread to other areas.
Mr Livingstone said the growth in revenue from hampers and debt collection
had helped to balance a static level of income from consumer loans, which
slipped from Pounds 19.07m to Pounds 18.96m.
He said the bank had raised profits despite the poor consumer loans market
because it could switch its 800 employees to businesses such as debt
collection, which thrived in recession.
Profit before financing the Pounds 37.5m net loan portfolio rose 8.5 per
cent to Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 5.9m).
Finance costs fell to Pounds 2.62m (Pounds 2.84m), helped by the fall in
base rates, and higher hedging of borrowings.
Earnings per share worked through at 5p (4.7p). The final dividend is 2.05p
for a total of 3p (2.75p).
