FT  01 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ends 1993 on sour note
Wall Street
US stocks ended the year on a sour note ,as share prices tumbled in the
final hour of a quiet session amid a burst of program trading, writes Frank
McGurty in New York. However, secondary indices finished with solid gains.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 21.79 to 3,754.09,
while the more broadly base Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.19 lower at 466.45.
But the American SE composite was 4.60 ahead at 477.15 and the Nasdaq
composite up 5.73 at 776.81.
Activity on the NYSE was light, with only 167m shares traded. The breadth of
the market was ahead. Advancing issues lead declines, 1,174 to 888.
With many investors taking a long holiday weekend and no fresh readings on
the economy due until Monday, early trading was largely restricted to
last-minute window-dressing by portfolio managers. In a fitting end to a
year in which low interest rates have underpinned the strength of stocks,
the US Treasury market was once again a distraction, especially in light of
the surprisingly sharp decline in bond prices the previous day.
Traders yesterday were content to allow long bond prices drift to mixed
levels in an abbreviated holiday session, with most sitting on the sidelines
until next week.
With equity investors reassured, the Dow climbed steadily until a late round
of activity linked to the expiration of quarterly index options brought a
30-point swing in the Dow in the last hour. The NYSE reported a string of
order imbalances, with most showing an excess of sellers.
When the smoke cleared, Caterpillar was down Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 89,
Disney Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 42 5/8 , and Allied Signal Dollars 1 to
Dollars 79.
Among the day's best performers, Primerica advanced Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars
38 7/8 following the approval by shareholders of the company's merger
agreement with Travelers, which added Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 31 1/8 . The
newly formed company will begin trading on the NYSE next week.
Stone Container was marked down Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 9 5/8 on fears that
its offer of 21m new common shares would dilute the value of existing stock
holdings.
On the Nasdaq, MCI Communications added a further Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars
28 1/4 amid expectations that the company would soon announce a Dollars 1bn
plan to build local telephone networks in most leading US cities.
Canada
Toronto stocks ended the year mixed in quiet trading. Based on preliminary
data, the TSE-300 composite index fell 8.45 points, or 0.20 per cent, to
4,321.43, with advances leading declines 442 to 261.
It gained about 29 per cent in 1993, having ended the 1992 trading year at
3,350.44.
