 

In addition, the certainty provided by today's rule is expected to stimulate considerable private investment in
renewable fuel production technology and capacity. EPA expects this investment to accelerate the development and
implementation of advanced, high-efficiency production processes, which in turn are expected to provide global
warming benefits and larger fossil fuel energy savings than can be provided by existing ethanol production facilities.



3. Impact on Farm Economy 


According to comments submitted by USDA, the renewable oxygenate program is expected to increase farm incomes by
increasing demand for farm products and creating a market for agricultural waste products. Based on USDA estimates,
the renewable oxygenate program will increase corn prices by approximately 4.06.7 cents per bushel when fully
implemented. Based on average annual corn production of 8.7 billion bushels, such a price increase would increase
farm income by approximately $348583 million.

 However, USDA projects a decrease in farm deficiency payments as a result of the increase in corn prices of $220369
million, so the net increase in farm income would be $128214 million per year.

To the extent that this increase in farm incomes results from higher prices for corn and other crops, some of the farm
income benefits may be lost as feed costs for livestock producers increase. However, it is unlikely that price increases
will account for the entire increase in farm incomes. Utilization of agricultural waste products and increased crop
production are also expected to increase farm incomes without increasing the price per bushel for corn and other ethanol
feedstocks. Hence the impact of the renewable oxygenate program is expected to have a net beneficial effect on the
farm economy. 


4. Impact on Natural Gas, Methanol, and MTBE Sectors 


EPA recognizes that the renewable oxygenate program may affect the growth prospects for the natural gas, methanol,
and MTBE sectors. To the extent that today's rule leads to larger market shares for ethanol and other renewable oxygenates
than otherwise would occur, the market share for nonrenewable oxygenates would be smaller than otherwise would occur.
