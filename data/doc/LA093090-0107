PROPOSITIONS M AND D 
Unfortunately, San Diego may never get a chance to adopt the concurrency 
measures referred to by John Koenig ("A Lesson Worth Heeding In San Diego," 
Sept. 9) if a phony growth-management proposition facing the voters this 
November passes. 
Proposition M and its county equivalent, Proposition D, are thinly disguised 
attempts by the building industry to prevent the City Council and Board of 
Supervisors from establishing concurrency. 
Among the key services these measures exempt from being provided concurrent 
with need are schools, police, jails, courts, libraries, recreation centers, 
parks, water and solid-waste disposal. This is particularly threatening because 
both propositions require a two-thirds council or supervisorial majority to 
mend their inadequacies. 
These propositions make a mockery of local government's efforts to insure a 
sensible growth plan for San Diego. The final indignity is that many of the 
developers who are M and D's key sponsors are not even based in San Diego.
