FT  17 NOV 92 / Extra Pounds 58m agreed for Iveco factory
FORD OF the US and Fiat of Italy are to inject a further Pounds 58m into
Iveco Ford Truck, their UK joint commercial vehicle subsidiary, to help
cover losses and maintain investment by the company.
The additional funding, agreed at an extraordinary general meeting a few
days ago, will bring to Pounds 95m the total of extra cash injected in the
past 12 months into Iveco Ford Truck, which is based in Langley, Berkshire.
The company made a net loss of Pounds 38.6m last year following one of
Pounds 22m in 1990, and has indicated that there will be a further loss for
the current year. It last made a profit, of Pounds 9.6m, in 1989.
The extra cash will take the form of increased share capital. Ford of the US
and Iveco, Fiat's commercial vehicles subsidiary, each have a 48 per cent
stake, with the remaining 4 per cent held by Credit Suisse First Boston.
The injection comes as the Langley plant prepares to halt production for
more than five weeks over the Christmas period, starting on December 4. The
workforce, which totalled 730 at the end of last year, is expected to number
only 510 at the end of this year.
The long Christmas break has been prompted in part by the severely depressed
state of the UK truck market, in which sales of heavy trucks have halved
since 1989.
The extended break will be used to remove the plant and equipment needed to
produce the Cargo truck range and gear up the plant to switch output
entirely to a range of Eurocargo models. The range was announced last year
and is being built in the UK and at Iveco's plant at Brescia, Italy. The
Langley plant is making between 22 and 25 Eurocargos and 15 to 17 Cargos a
day.
Iveco Ford Truck said yesterday it was still looking for a further 40 to 50
people to leave the company under a long-standing voluntary redundancy
scheme.
