  [Text] Tokyo 8 April, KAZTAG-TASS -- Kazakhstan's President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev announced today that his words about the 
creation of a Euro-Asian community similar to the European Union 
to replace the former Soviet Union was "just an idea aired and 
not a formal official proposal." 
  He was responding to a question from ITAR-TASS and KAZTAG 
correspondent at a press conference devoted to the results of 
his visit to Japan. 
  Nonetheless the president said he would works towards the 
materialization of his idea. 
  Nazarbayev said he had always been of the opinion that the 
present structure of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a 
supra-state within the framework of the dissolved Soviet Union 
is not exactly what is needed. At a meeting with Moscow 
University students during his recent visit to Russia he "voiced 
the idea deliberately." 
  "I now watch with interest the reaction of the leaders of 
the 
commonwealth member countries to my initiative," he said. 
  Nazarbayev did not say whether he is going to raise the 
question about the Euro-Asian union at the forthcoming 
commonwealth summit.
