CHENEN'S 3-POINT PLAY LIFTS EL CAMINO REAL 
There El Camino Real High forward Allen Chenen stood Friday night, toeing the 
free-throw line in the Taft gym with two seconds left in a tie game against his 
school's archrival. 
These neighborhood and Northwest Valley Conference foes had overcome some early 
sloppiness to play a taut fourth quarter. And now it was up to Chenen, who had 
just converted a clutch, off-balance bank shot to tie the score and then was 
fouled by Taft's Cornell Hill on the play. 
"My heart was in my feet," Chenen said after the game. 
But who needs a heart to sink a game-winning free throw? Not Chenen, whose 
offering hit nothing but net to complete the three-point play and give El 
Camino Real a 54-53 win. 
The finish caused El Camino Real Coach Mike McNulty to leap high into the air, 
a rare display of emotion from the usually reserved coach. 
Just 30 seconds before Chenen's game-winning play, Taft sophomore Casey 
Sheahan, who scored a team-high 16 points, had drilled a three-point shot, his 
fourth of the game, to give Taft a 53-51 lead, its first since a 6-4 advantage 
early in the first quarter. 
Sheahan's shot capped a Toreador comeback in which Taft outscore El Camino 
Real, 10-1, in the final four minutes. 
Taft (12-5, 2-1 in conference play) hurt itself in the first half, making just 
nine of 28 shots and committing numerous turnovers. 
El Camino Real (5-7, 2-1), meanwhile, wasn't exactly on top of its game despite 
Todd Orlando's game-high 17 points. 
The Conquistadores made just 11 of 27 first-half shots but led, 24-20, at 
halftime. 
The Conquistadores built the lead to nine at 35-26 before Taft mounted its run. 
But that run fell just short, courtesy of Chenen, who hit the winning layup 
last week in a two-point win over Granada Hills. 
So this stuff is old hat to you, now, eh, Allen? 
He smiled shyly. "Yeah, it's getting pretty old."
