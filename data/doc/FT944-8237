FT  21 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Co-operatives consider merger
Two Midlands co-operative societies are considering merging to form one of
the largest co-operatives in the UK with an annual turnover of more than
Pounds 600m.
The Central Midlands Co-operative Society and Leicestershire Co-operative
Society have established a working party which is expected to come up with
proposals by the end of next month.
The merged societies would have 8,000 employees and cover Warwickshire,
Leicestershire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, and
Northamptonshire as well as Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. Last year the
CMCS achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.8m, while the LCS made Pounds
3.5m.
The CMCS said that both societies were financially strong, and the merger
would be a consolidation of strength that could lead to further expansion.
The new society would have 170 food stores, including 14 superstores, and
would be a leading regional dairy, bottling 1m pints of milk a day. It would
also be the Midlands' largest funeral director, with 42 funeral homes.
