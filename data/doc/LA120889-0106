BEIJING TO EXPAND POLICE FOR ASIA GAMES 
The Chinese capital has launched its first large-scale police recruiting drive, 
saying security forces must be expanded to meet "increased demand for 
maintaining public order" during the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing, an official 
newspaper said Thursday. 
China Daily quoted an official as saying that Beijing's police hope to find 
4,000 recruits. The newspaper said the main reason for the drive is to ensure 
security during the Asian Games, which many residents believe could become a 
focus for renewed anti-government unrest.
