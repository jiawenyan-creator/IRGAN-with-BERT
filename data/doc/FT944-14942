FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: BankAmerica meets expectations
BankAmerica, the second largest bank in the US, yesterday reported a 13 per
cent improvement in third-quarter earnings to Dollars 547m, or Dollars 1.36
a share.
The results, lifted by the contribution of the Chicago-based Continental
Bank, which BankAmerica acquired earlier this year for Dollars 1.9bn, were
in line with analysts' estimates.
BankAmerica said the addition of Continental's businesses had given it
improved access to US wholesale customers, especially in the Midwest, where
it has set up a new subsidiary and relocated its corporate banking
operation.
Net interest income rose to Dollars 1.9bn in the latest quarter from Dollars
1.88bn a year ago.
However, without Continental's Dollars 40m contribution, net interest income
would have fallen slightly in the quarter as an increase in loans failed to
offset a fall in the bank's net interest margin from 4.72 per cent to 4.51
per cent.
Credit quality improved in the period, with BankAmerica having to set aside
only Dollars 110m as a provision for loan losses in the quarter, compared
with Dollars 178m a year earlier.
Non-interest income, meanwhile, increased Dollars 68m to just under Dollars
1.1bn, with just over half of the improvement derived from Continental.
