FT  30 SEP 94 / Lauda Air in row over Orly
The French government is heading for a clash with the European Commission
over its refusal to allow Lauda Air flights from Vienna and Salzburg to land
at Paris's Orly airport. The action disregards one of the key conditions
which accompanied the commission's decision in July to allow the French
government to grant FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) of state aid to Air France, the
nation's bankrupt airline. The conditions clearly stated that in return for
the injection of state funds, Orly airport must be opened to competing
airlines. Mr Nicky Lauda yesterday met senior European commission officials
to complain about the French rejection of the private airline's flight
plans. Lauda Air already has the landing slots required to fly its routes
into the Paris airport. British Airways and British Midland were only
recently granted access to Orly airport after a protracted battle with the
French authorities.
