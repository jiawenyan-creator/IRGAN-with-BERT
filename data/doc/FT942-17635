FT  02 APR 94 / Fraud at British Council attacked
The British Council, the government-funded body that promotes UK cultural
interests overseas, has been strongly criticised by a Commons committee over
lax accounting procedures which led to a fraud costing nearly Pounds
600,000.
The cross-party Public Accounts Committee said that the fraud was one of the
biggest it had investigated, and warned that there was a risk it could
happen again.
The committee said in a report to parliament that the council paid Pounds
520,072 by electronic transfer into the overseas bank accounts of bogus
suppliers in December 1992.
Other irregularities, including fraud involving travel and subsistence
claims, brought the total losses identified in 1992-93 to Pounds 589,000.
The report said a police investigation had indicated that the main fraud was
executed by 'a criminal team' operating with inside information on the
council's payment system. Four people had been arrested, but only Pounds
19,751 had been recovered. Police inquiries had failed to establish the
source of the leak of information on the payments system.
The committee said it was 'astonished' that the council's banking section
did not check payment vouchers, documentation and signatures before paying
suppliers. It said the council had changed its procedures to prevent further
frauds, but it was 'worrying' that the source of the gang's information had
not been identified.
It said: 'There is a risk of a further leakage of sensitive information. We
emphasise the need for the council's changed and strengthened financial
processes to be proof against any further irregularities.'
