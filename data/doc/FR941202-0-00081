 

(ii) Demonstrate that their solvent cleaning machine can achieve and maintain an idling emission limit of 0.22 kilograms
per hour per square meter (0.045 pounds per hour per square foot) of solvent/air interface area as determined using
the procedures in 63.465(a) and appendix A of this part. 

(c) Except as provided in 63.464, each owner or operator of an in-line cleaning machine shall comply with paragraph
(c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section as appropriate. 

(1) Each owner or operator of an existing in-line cleaning machine shall comply with the requirements specified in
either paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section. 

(i) Employ one of the control combinations listed in table 3 of this subpart or other equivalent methods of control
as determined using the procedure in 63.469, equivalent methods of control.

Table 3._Control Combinations for Existing In-Line Solvent Cleaning Machines 


1Option 
1Control combinations 





1 
Superheated vapor, freeboard ratio of 1.0. 
2 
Freeboard refrigeration device, freeboard ratio of 1.0. 
3 
Dwell, freeboard refrigeration device. 
4 
Dwell, carbon adsorber. 




Note: 

Unlike most of the control techniques available for complying with this rule, carbon adsorbers are not considered
to be a pollution prevention measure. Use of such units may impose additional cost and burden for a number of reasons.
First, carbon adsorption units are generally more expensive than other controls listed in the options. Second, these
units may present cross-media impacts such as effluent discharges if not properly operated and maintained, and spent
carbon beds have to be disposed of as hazardous waste. When making decisions about what controls to install on halogenated
solvent cleaning machines to meet the requirements of this rule, all of these factors should be weighed and pollution
prevention measures are encouraged wherever possible.
