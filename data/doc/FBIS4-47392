  [Abstract] The need for and desirability of constructing 
deep underground repositories in rock salt formations for the 
storage of solid and cast-off toxic and radioactive industrial 
wastes is demonstrated. Foreign experience along these lines is 
discussed. The principal requirements on rock salt formations, 
regarded as potential sites for constructing cavernous 
repositories, are examined and the technological procedures for 
preparing such repositories are outlined. Different variants are 
evaluated, but in every case the excavation results in recovery 
of great volumes of valuable mineral raw material useful in the 
production of various kinds of soda, paper, artificial rubber 
and other products. The need for developing a special 
engineering geology classification of salt formations is 
validated. A table lists the principal regions in Russia which 
could be considered for constructing such salt formation 
repositories. The selection criteria show that it would be most 
effective to use salt formations of the stratum type, as well as 
those characterized by a relatively simple internal structure. 
In this selection process it is particularly necessary to 
ascertain the spatial position of intercalations of insoluble 
rocks and also easily soluble (potassic, magnesian salts) 
formations. Additional factors must be taken into account when 
considering complex structures of the salt dome type. References
