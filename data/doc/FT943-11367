FT  30 JUL 94 / UK Company News: H&amp;C cuts plantations link with Dollars 273m
sale
Harrisons &amp; Crosfield yesterday closed the book on almost a century of
history with the announcement that it had sold its Indonesian plantations to
a group of four Indonesian businessmen for Dollars 273m (Pounds 176m) cash.
The disposal has been expected for some time. Harrisons, which began life in
the 19th century as a tea trader, has been steadily severing its traditional
links since the late 1980s.
Harrison's 19 Indonesian estates, producing palm oil, rubber, cocoa, copra,
tea and coffee, are by far the most profitable of the company's remaining
plantations. They were nationalised by the Indonesian government in 1964,
but returned to Harrison's ownership in 1969.
Last year they contributed Pounds 18.1m of the reported Pounds 24m in
plantation operating profits.
The group retains a 57 per cent stake in palm oil plantations in Papua New
Guinea.
Mr Bill Turcan, the new chief executive, said Harrisons had got the best
possible price against a background of rising palm oil prices.
The proceeds would be used to reduce short-term debt, he said, with the
balance put on deposit. If the sale had been completed in the last financial
year, debt would have been reduced to Pounds 91m to give gearing of 14 per
cent compared with the reported 48 per cent.
Earnings would have been diluted by about 0.5p.
The company would be publishing pro forma accounts for shareholders when it
reported its interim results on Wednesday, Mr Turcan said.
The disposal is part of Harrisons' strategy to reposition its businesses.
However, it was also forced on the group in part by the Indonesian
president's decree that at least 20 per cent of the business had to be sold
to Indonesian nationals. Harrisons had been preparing for a flotation in
1996, but decided to sell the whole operation after several approaches.
