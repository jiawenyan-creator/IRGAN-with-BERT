FT  29 DEC 92 / Letter: Co-operative sector demonstrates the continuing
relevance of real 'federalism' in business
Sir, Christopher Lorenz's critique of 'federalism' as the latest fashion in
the 'glossy' management journals was appropriately acerbic (Management,
December 18).
What he failed to mention was that, like all fashion revivals, the ersatz is
always preceded by the genuine article.
Some of the most successful experiments in corporate federalism have been in
co-operatives, which combine representative democracy with business
enterprise.
These organisations are founded on federalist principles with 'sovereign'
members creating a primary society through their patronage and
participation. Primaries, in turn, link together to form secondary and
tertiary federals which provide common services and achieve economies of
scale.
This model, first developed in retail distribution in Britain in the
mid-19th century, has been applied to agriculture, insurance, financial
services, fisheries and manufacturing in over 80 countries.
Among the most successful are the Japanese co-operative federals which have
played a vital role in the development of their economy and society since
the end of the second world war.
The Japanese co-operative federals are now so strong that they hosted the
recent 30th International Co-operative Congress in Tokyo with more than
1,000 delegates. This was the first congress of the world federation to be
held in Asia and the first to be addressed by a prime minister.
With over 700m people in membership of more than 250,000 businesses
worldwide, the co-operative sector demonstrates the continuing relevance of
real federalism in business.
