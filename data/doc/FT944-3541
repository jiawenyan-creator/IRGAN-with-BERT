FT  13 DEC 94 / Weak retail figures likely
Competition is forcing shops to cut prices to attract Christmas shoppers,
retail experts said yesterday.
Figures this week are expected to show little sign of a strong recovery in
consumer demand and the retail sector is bracing itself for disappointing
sales in what is usually its busiest period.
Mr Clive Marshall, an analyst with retail research group Verdict, said:
'Over recent years retailers have been doing a lot of discounting and
consumers are starting to expect it. They are sitting on their hands and not
going out to shop until retailers start cutting prices.'
This view is echoed by the British Retail Consortium, which said profit
margins were being cut as stores competed for custom.
Two lots of figures on consumer demand are due this week - from the
Confederation of British Industry today and the government on Thursday.
