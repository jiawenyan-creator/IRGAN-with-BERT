FT  04 JUN 93 / Halifax says house prices fell in May
THE SURGE in house prices recorded earlier this year was thrown into reverse
last month, Halifax Building Society said yesterday. Its report raised
further doubts about the strength of the UK's economic recovery.
Halifax, Britain's largest building society, said average prices fell in May
by 1.2 per cent, the largest monthly fall for nine months. Prices had risen
1.4 per cent in March and 1.7 per cent in April.
The picture conflicts with figures earlier this week from Nationwide, the
second-biggest society, which said average house prices rose 1 per cent in
May, the third consecutive monthly increase.
Halifax emphasised, however, that monthly price falls can be expected at
this stage in the housing cycle. It said the market continued to display
signs of gradual recovery, with prices 'set to move on to a generally rising
trend over the next few months'.
Evidence of a more buoyant picture is also starting to be reflected in
housing land prices. A surge of buying interest among housebuilders has
triggered reported price rises of up to 30 per cent on certain development
sites in recent weeks. Rising houses sales are encouraging some builders
short of land to begin rebuilding their land banks.
Average house prices - now 3.3 per cent below May 1992 - are expected by
Halifax to end 1993 slightly higher than at the start of the year, with a
stronger recovery becoming more obvious in 1994. It stressed that realistic
prices continue to be necessary to generate sales.
Prices of new houses appear to be strengthening at a faster rate than for
the market as a whole, according to Halifax figures.
They rose 0.2 per cent in May and stood 0.8 per cent higher than a year
earlier, the first time the annual rate of new house price inflation has
been above zero since October 1990. Prices paid by first-time buyers stayed
weaker.
