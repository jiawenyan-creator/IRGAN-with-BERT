FT  11 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Trading begins in new fund
A NEW emerging markets fund began trading on the London stock exchange
yesterday, writes John Pitt.
The Baring Securities Emerging Markets index tracker fund, with an initial
capitalisation of Dollars 50m, follows the launch of the broker's index last
October.
The closed-end fund will track the index through investment in a diversified
portfolio of equity securities of 214 listed companies, spread between 12
countries in Asia, Latin America and Europe.
The index weights emerging markets according to the proportion of
capitalisation available to non-domestic investors, and provides a benchmark
of markets with regard to shares in which investors can realistically trade.
