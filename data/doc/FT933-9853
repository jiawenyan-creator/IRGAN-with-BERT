FT  07 AUG 93 / Romania acts on pit strike
The Romanian government began legal action yesterday to halt a miners'
strike after President Ion Iliescu said the strikers should 'learn from the
Japanese' about hard work, Reuter reports. The strikers have demanded a
doubling of basic monthly wages to up to 224,000 lei (Pounds 188). With
bonuses this would give them up to 10 times the national average wage.
