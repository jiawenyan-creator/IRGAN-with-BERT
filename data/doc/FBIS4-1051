  [Text] There have been more defeats in Cuanza Norte where 
MPLA-PT [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor 
Party] troops are on the offensive against areas controlled by 
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. 
Violent clashes have taken place in the past few hours on the 
banks of Lucala 2 River and in the (Ndombe-ia-Dombe) region. 
South African mercenaries are involved in the operations. Our 
N'Dalatando correspondent reports: 
  The enemy attempted to cross Lucala 2 River, but was 
repelled 
[passage indistinct] an armored vehicle carrying a platoon of 
South African mercenaries was completely destroyed. We are 
waiting for a final report on the losses. Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos' troops flattened to the ground a civilian (?settlement). 
One of the civilians who survived the attack said he saw many 
whites [passage indistinct].
