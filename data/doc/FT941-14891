FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Peel tops Pounds 2m with help from port
side
Peel Holdings, the Man-chester-based property group, yesterday reported a
rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.64m to Pounds 2.21m for the six months
to September 30.
Mr John Whitaker, chairman, said the property leasing market remained
extremely competitive and the company was only marginally increasing
property development activities, despite more favourable market conditions.
Turnover increased to Pounds 33m (Pounds 32.2m) boosted by Pounds 4.4m from
land disposals and net rental income of Pounds 20.1m.
In the second half of the year the company will accrue an additional Pounds
880,000 as a result of the expiry of rent free agreements and from upward
rent reviews.
Losses per share emerged at 0.61p (0.95p) but the interim dividend is lifted
to 1.3p (1p) reflecting expectations of a stronger second half.
Manchester Ship Canal's port operations contributed Pounds 2.5m at the
operating level. The operations are seasonable and should record a higher
contribution in the second half.
Analysts also expect an improved performance from Peel's core property
business.
The company last year won a six year battle to buy out the minority
shareholders of Manchester Ship Canal in order to realise some of the
redevelopment value of the company's substantial land bank.
Peel is proposing the Pounds 200m construction of a commercial centre on a
300-acre site next to the canal, but planning permission is still being
blocked by eight local authorities, which are appealing a court ruling
allowing the project to go ahead.
Peel's debt levels remain high with net debt marginally increasing from its
March 1993 figure of Pounds 336m. Analysts forecast year-end gearing of
about 100 per cent.
Net interest of Pounds 17.5m (Pounds 19.4m) in the first half, compared with
operating profit of Pounds 19.8m (Pounds 21.1m).
