  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn received at the Royal 
Hashemite Court today a number of the deportees of the intifadah 
leadership who are returning to their homeland after the 
occupation authorities allowed them to return. They thanked his 
majesty for the care they received from their brothers and 
kinsfolk here in Jordan. They also expressed their pride in and 
appreciation of His Majesty King Husayn's honorable pan-Arab 
stands toward the kinsfolk in the occupied homeland, and toward 
the Palestinian people's issues and rights. 
  Addressing the deportees, his majesty expressed his pride in 
the steadfastness of the kinsfolk in the occupied homeland on 
their national soil, and his appreciation of their suffering and 
sacrifices which, God willing, will pave the way for the 
emergence of a new dawn in the history of the nation and the 
future of its generations.
