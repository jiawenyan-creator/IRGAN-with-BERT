  [Text] Prague, Feb 22 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus 
said today that Defense Minister Antonin Baudys had overstepped 
the powers of a constitutional official and made a gross mistake 
which harmed the Czech Republic. 
  Speaking on Czech Radio, Klaus said that the world would 
smile at Baudys's initiative to solve the Bosnian conflict and 
doubt the very thing "which we are continuously trying to convey 
to the world -- that we are a normal country." 
  Baudys acquainted journalists on Saturday with his proposal 
to end the Bosnian conflict, admitting that he had consulted 
neither the government nor parliament. 
  Under the proposal, the conflict would be solved mainly by a 
good will committee, which would be entrusted by the UN. To 
supervise the situation. The committee would comprise several 
states connected by religion with the Bosnian warring parties, 
for instance, Russia, Greece, Pakistan, Turkey, France, and 
Italy. 
  Klaus said the sharp criticism of Baudys at Monday's session 
of the Executive Council of the Civic Democratic Party, of which 
Klaus is the Chairman, was not aimed at his immediate dismissal. 
But Baudys's move cannot be passed over in silence, Klaus 
pointed out.
