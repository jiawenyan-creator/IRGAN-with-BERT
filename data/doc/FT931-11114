FT  04 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs press on property funds for
developers
PRIVATE property developers could compete with housing associations for
Housing Corporation funds if ministers respond to pressure from Tory MPs and
council leaders.
Scottish Homes, the Housing Corporation's Scottish counterpart, already has
the ability to distribute funds to the private sector, and many within the
housing association movement in England believe that ministers would be
enthusiastic to extend that regime.
Some Tories believe also that the private sector should be able to tender to
manage housing association stock, as well as competing for funds to develop
properties.
The pressure on ministers reflects unease among urban Tory MPs and council
leaders that the largest housing associations have become too bureaucratic.
Sir Paul Beresford, Tory MP for Croydon Central and one of the backbenchers
most involved in the campaign, says that properties of some housing
associations are so widespread that their ability to manage large stocks is
called into question.
Groups of London Tory MPs have had meetings with Mr Michael Howard, the
environment secretary, and his colleagues to express their concern about the
way the housing association movement has developed.
One response from the backbenchers has been to suggest that all housing
association tenants should be given the right to buy. They recognise,
however, that the expansion of the private finance element in the Housing
Corporation's spending has made it more difficult to devise plans that are
seen to be fair.
Within the housing industry, the Tories' concerns are seen as not applying
to the majority of housing associations. Of the 2,177 housing associations
registered in England, only 11 have more than 10,000 units, and only about
140 have more than 1,000.
