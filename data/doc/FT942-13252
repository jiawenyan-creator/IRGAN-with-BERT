FT  26 APR 94 / Observer: Trading names
While Bonn slugs it out with Geneva to decide which city wins the
headquarters of the new World Trade Organisation, everybody seems to have
missed the fact that the WTO already has a home - in Madrid.
Not quite the same thing, admittedly. But the World Tourism Organisation is
more than a little peeved that its acronym has been pinched by this
johnny-come-lately to the international glad-handing scene. The original
121-nation WTO has been in existence since 1975, after all.
When the name for the new trade body was proposed last year, the tourism mob
protested to Gatt director-general Peter Sutherland but failed to stir up
support among member governments. A representative was dispatched to Gatt
before this month's signing ceremony in Marrakesh but found that the new
title - favoured by the US - was already a fait accompli.
The Madrid-based organisation now has to decide whether to live with the
confusion or change its own name. Maybe it should contact the new WTO's
officials dealing with infringements of intellectual copyrights and
trademarks . . .
