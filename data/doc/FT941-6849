FT  28 FEB 94 / People: Jaffre takes tighter grip at Elf
The reshuffle of top posts at the head of Elf-Aquitaine, France's largest
industrial group, continues apace following the arrival of Philippe Jaffre
as chairman last August, writes John Ridding. Bruno Weymuller, president of
Elf Petroland, the oil group's Dutch subsidiary, is to replace Philippe
Hustache as chief financial officer. Hustache, who helped steer the group
through its privatisation, completed earlier this month, is leaving the
group to become president of the Dassault family's financial and property
arm.
Like many of Elf's top managers, Weymuller is a graduate of the prestigious
Ecole Nationale Superieure des Mines in Paris, a training ground for
engineers and industrialists. Weymuller, who is 45, also has a degree in
science from MIT.
The new finance director will not, however, take Hustache's place on the
company's senior management committee. This may suggest that Jaffre, former
chairman of Credit Agricole, France's largest bank, and a product of the
French financial administration, may himself be taking a tighter grip on the
group's financial affairs.
Since taking control of the oil group, Jaffre has given priority to raising
the returns on investments and winding down less profitable ventures. He is
currently seeking, for example, to reduce Elf's participation in a FFr15bn
project in eastern Germany to rebuild an ageing refinery.
As well as promoting Weymuller, Jaffre also looked inside the group for a
new administrative director. Philippe Jacques, currently head of the group's
Russian subsidiary, will take over the post from the beginning of April.
