PCC Rules



As a result of the substantial diminution of PCC's operations, PCC revised its rules so they accurately reflect the
actual functions and services PCC performs. As revised, PCC's rules consist of fourteen separate rules detailing
participants' and PCC's rights and obligations with respect to each other.



Rule 1 sets out definitions. Rule 2 discusses membership requirements, including financial responsibility requirements
and operational capacity requirements.

to be followed in the case of a participant's insolvency. Rule 11 discusses disciplinary procedures. Rule 12 discusses
a participant's right to appeal an adverse decision by PCC relating to the termination of the participant's membership,
the participant's insolvency, or a disciplinary proceeding. Rule 13 describes various procedures relating to such
