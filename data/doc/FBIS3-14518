  [Excerpt] The Aircraft Factory of the Arab 
Industrialization Organization has concluded a supplementary 
contract with the U.S. Lockheed Corporation, which manufactures 
the F-16 fighters, according to which more of the aircraft's 
parts will be manufactured in Egypt. The $21 million contract 
is valid for five years and is renewable. The initial and 
supplementary contracts provide for manufacturing parts for 80 
F-16's for Lockheed. 
  Last month, the Aircraft Factory began production of the 
equipment needed for manufacturing parts of the U.S. F-16's. 
Delivery of the first manufactured parts will begin early next 
year. [passage omitted].
