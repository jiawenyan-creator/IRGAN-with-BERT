FT  16 APR 94 / Markets: Concession on CGT losses - At a Glance
The government has made a last minute concession to individual investors on
the indexation of capital gains tax losses. It will allow up to Pounds
10,000 of losses caused by indexation between 30 November 1993 and 5 April
1995 for CGT purposes. This will benefit investors with unrelieved capital
gains. Anyone paying higher rate tax and with Pounds 10,000 of unrelieved
gains stands to save Pounds 4,000 tax in 1993-4, 1994-5. (See page IX).
