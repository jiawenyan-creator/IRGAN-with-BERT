  [Text] Santiago May 23 TASS -- Chile has accumulated rich 
experience in democratic transformations and economic 
development which can be fruitful for Russia, Vladimir Shumeiyo, 
the speaker of the Federation Council, told reporters upon 
arrival in the Latin American country on Sunday. 
  He is to meet Chilean President Eduardo Frei Ruiz and hand 
over a message from Boris Yeltsin to him. 
  Shumeyko said he is satisfied with the current state of 
bilateral relations and, in particular, in trade and economic 
cooperation. "The long-standing ties between Russia and friendly 
Chile are based on principles of mutual respect and equality", 
the speaker of the upper chamber of the Russian Parliament 
stressed. 
  Chile is the first leg of Shumeyko's trip to Latin America. 
"I do not share the opinion that Latin America lies far away 
from Russian interests", he said and added that the experience 
of certain countries of the region in democratic transformations 
and economic reforms can be useful for Russia. 
  Shumeyko, who is accompanied by heads of Russian privatised 
companies, including president of the major "Lukoil" oil firm 
Vagit Alekperov, is to visit Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela and 
Equador.
