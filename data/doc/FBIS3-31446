  [Text] Lukavica, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Feb 18 (AFP) -- 
Bosnian Government and rebel Serb military commanders Friday 
agreed on three new control sites for grouping heavy weapons, 
said a UN spokesman who reaffirmed the threat of airstrikes if 
the NATO ultimatum was ignored. 
  Two sites for Serb heavy weapons and one for heavy artillery 
belonging to the Moslem-dominated Bosnian Army had been worked 
out, said UN Protection Force spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel 
Richard Pernod. 
  "It is a positive step but the three-day deadline is still 
valid and both parties have to be convinced of that and respect 
their undertakings. Otherwise there will be air strikes," said 
Pernod. 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ultimatum to Bosnian 
Serbs to withdraw heavy weapons from around Sarajevo expires 
Sunday at 2400 GMT. 
  "We expect other Serb convoys will leave the exclusion zone 
(around Sarajevo) today," he added, refering to the demand by 
NATO that heavy artillery be pulled back 20 kilometres (12 
miles) from central Sarajevo or placed under UN supervision. 
  However, the new sites agreement had not yet been enforced, 
said Pernod, and no new weapons had been handed in. 
  The additional control sites for Serbs are at the villages 
of 
Blagovat and Saracevac, north of Sarajevo. Mokro and Vela, east 
of the capital and the Serb-held Lukavica barracks in the 
Sarajevo suburbs are already in use. 
  The Bosnian Army, currently using the downtown Marshall Tito 
barracks to canton its heavy guns, is to place weapons under UN 
supervision at Malo Polje, on Mount Igman, southwest of Sarajevo.
