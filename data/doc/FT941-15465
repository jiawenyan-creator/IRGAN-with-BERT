FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Procter to shed 1,800 jobs
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, yesterday said it was to
close four plants, scale down six more, and shed 1,800 jobs in North America
as part of the restructuring plan it announced last July.
The plants to close (and the products they make) are in Baltimore, Maryland
(dishwashing liquid and glycerin); Pointe Claire, Quebec (health and beauty
products); Quincy, Massachusetts (soap bars and fatty acids); and San
Francisco (Folgers coffee).
The company will stop making domestic cleaning products at its plant in
Sacramento, California; its Hamilton, Ontario, plant will stop making health
and beauty products and fabric softeners; and the manufacture of
incontinence products will transfer from its plant in Modesto, California.
Product lines will also move out of plants in Iowa City, Kansas City, and
Greensboro, North Carolina, but without any compulsory job losses.
P&amp;G said business remained healthy and production in the categories affected
was expanding at other sites, but the total number of plants had to be
reduced if the company was to remain competitive.
Last July P&amp;G announced that 13,000 of its 106,000 jobs world-wide would be
shed over the next three or four years as part of a drive to improve
efficiency.
The cuts announced yesterday - the first to be detailed under the July plan
 -represent about half those that will fall in North America.
