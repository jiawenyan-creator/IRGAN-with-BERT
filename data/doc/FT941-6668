FT  01 MAR 94 / 'Buns not guns' company calls in receivers
A gateau-making company that was at the centre of a 'buns not guns'
relocation controversy has gone into receivership, less than a year after
opening.
The Pounds 7m investment at Preston Farm, Stockton-on-Tees, by Livera Foods
was announced in a written Commons reply two years ago by Mr Michael
Portillo, then inner-cities minister. He linked it to the government's
announcement the same day that a planned Ministry of Defence relocation to
Preston Farm had been abandoned.
The Commons announcement of the plant produced mixed feelings in Teesside,
with critics comparing its jobs unfavourably with the 1,600 jobs the
relocation of the MoD's Quality Assurance Unit would have brought.
Mr Portillo said the gateau plant was expected to create up to 700 jobs,
plus 100 in supplier companies. Its founder, Mr Chris Liveras, who opened
the factory last March, announced in September he was increasing the
workforce by 250 to 600 because of 'phenomenal growth' in orders.
Yesterday receivers Arthur Andersen said they had been called in late on
Friday at the request of the banks, with Livera Foods' consent. Mr Alan
Katz, joint receiver, said: 'The company has had demand and production
difficulties for some time and this had had a cumulative effect.'
The receivers said the company, which had a turnover of about Pounds 6m and
supplied supermarkets and the food retail trade, employed 300 staff. Of
these, 140 who had been laid off were yesterday made redundant; the other
160 were laid off yesterday but have been asked to return tomorrow.
Mr Katz said the support of its customers and suppliers was being sought in
the hope of keeping the company trading and selling it as a going concern.
Several parties were already interested.
