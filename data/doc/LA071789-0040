THE STATE; 
VALDEZ TAKES MORE DAMAGE 
Rough seas have caused further damage to the tanker Exxon Valdez, which 
continues to leak small amounts of an unidentified substance into the ocean off 
San Diego, the U.S. Coast Guard said. Heavy seas bent back three more steel 
plates from the tanker's bottom, bringing the total to nine, Coast Guard Lt. Ed 
Bass said. The jagged steel plates hanging from the tanker's bottom make its 
draft too deep for San Diego's port where the Valdez was being towed for 
repairs. The Exxon tanker, which caused the worst oil spill ever in the United 
States when it ran aground in Alaska in March, has been towed to calmer waters 
about 20 miles off San Clemente Island, Bass said. Despite the new damage, the 
vessel is still structurally sound, an Exxon spokeswoman said.
