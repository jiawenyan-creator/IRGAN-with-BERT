  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP December 24 -- Cambodian Government 
has decided to set up an anti-AIDS national commission as the 
number of people recorded HIV positive jumped up to 2,000 by 
late this year, among them 223 developed AIDS. 
  The figure was seen in a report delivered by Chhea Thang, 
minister of public health, on the occasion of world AIDS day 
held in Phnom Penh early this month. 
  The decision on the foundation of the commission was signed 
on December 11 by Norodom Sirivut and Sar Kheng, vice-prime 
ministers of the Royal Government of Cambodia. 
  The commission with Public Health Minister Chhea Thang as 
president is composed of two vice presidents and 10 members who 
are secretaries of state of the ministries of education, youth 
and sports; social affairs; information; home affairs; economics 
and finance; tourism; planning; foreign affairs and 
international cooperation; national defence; women affairs; and 
culture; and deputy heads of provincial and municipal 
administration services. 
  The commission is duty-bound to set up anti-AIDS measures, 
examine AIDS infection in Cambodia, and counsel the government, 
laboratories and hospitals on the situation of AIDS.
