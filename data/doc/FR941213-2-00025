Before Commissioners: Elizabeth Anne Moler, Chair; Vicky A. Bailey, James J. Hoecker, William L. Massey, and Donald
F. Santa, Jr.




Issued: December 6, 1994.



On August 2, 1994, in Docket No. GP9416000, the Commission preliminarily found that five well determinations
by the Office of Conservation for the State of Louisiana (Louisiana) are not supported by substantial evidence.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Louisiana's determinations find that gas produced from the five wells qualifies as natural gas produced from geopressured
brine under section 107(c)(2) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA).

</FOOTNOTE>


On September 6, 1994, WRT Energy Corporation (WRT), the applicant before Louisiana, filed a letter withdrawing its
applications for the five wells. By letter dated September 9, 1994, the Commission advised WRT that the withdrawal
nullified the applications and Louisiana's determinations and terminated the proceeding in Docket No. GP9416000.

On September 19, 1994, WRT asked the Commission to allow it to withdraw its letter filed on September 6, 1994, and, if
necessary, to reinstate the proceeding in Docket No. GP9416000. WRT states that it withdrew its applications
because it believed that it would not have sufficient time to effectively respond to the preliminary finding but that
after it withdrew its applications, it became aware that staff would allow WRT additional time to file comments.

Subsequently, WRT and Louisiana filed comments urging the Commission to reverse the preliminary finding on October
5, 1994. In addition, an informal conference was held on October 26, 1994, and WRT, Louisiana and the Interstate Oil
and Gas Compact Commission (IOCC) filed comments urging the Commission to find that gas from the five wells qualify
as geopressured brine gas on November 4, 1994, November 8, 1994, and November 4, 1994, respectively.

Pursuant to 275.202(d) of the regulations, the letter WRT filed on September 6, 1994 nullified both the determinations
and the underlying applications on that date.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 However, since WRT states that it withdrew the applications due to a misunderstanding and has filed additional comments
to support the applications, for good cause shown, we grant WRT's request to withdraw the letter filed on September
6, 1994, so as to reinstate its applications and Louisiana's determinations as of the date of this order. However,
inasmuch as the proceeding in Docket No. GP941600 has been terminated, the Commission will process
the determinations, and underlying applications, in a new proceeding and hereby makes a preliminary finding in Docket
No. GP9418000, pursuant to the procedures previously set forth in section 275.202(a) of the regulations,
that Louisiana's determinations for the five wells are not supported by substantial evidence in the records upon
which they were made for the reasons stated in our August 2, 1994 Notice of Preliminary Finding. In addition, the record
in Docket No. GP9416000 is included in new Docket No. GP9418000.

Order No. 567, issued on July 28, 1994, rescinded the Commission's NGPA's regulations, including Section 275 as of
that date (68 FERC  61,135). The Commission stated, however, that rescission of Part 275 is prospective only
and that timely filed applications for well determination proceedings still pending before the Commission will
continue to be subject to the requirements of Part 275 as that section existed before July 28, 1994.

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission will issue a final order in Docket No. GP9418000 no later than 120 days from the date hereof.
Since the final order will consider the comments filed on the August 2, 1994 preliminary finding and the comments filed
after the informal conference, WRT, Louisiana and the IOCC need not file additional comments.




By the Commission.
