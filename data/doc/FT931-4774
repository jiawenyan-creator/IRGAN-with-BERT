FT  09 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cook's tender debated
THE WHITE knight duly arrived at the battle for Owners Abroad, taking the
shape of Thomas Cook, the German-owned travel agency group. But the stock
market's view was that Cook's tender move was 'too little, too late' to save
the UK's second largest tour operator from the Pounds 290m bid from
Airtours, its smaller rival. The tender offer is conditional on Airtours'
bid lapsing.
However, analysts reported that Cook's 150p a share cash tender offer for
12.5 per cent of the Owners equity had attracted some interest among
institutions.
Owners' management was reported to be following up what was described as a
'highly positive' meeting between analysts and Thomas Cook by holding
discussions with some of its larger shareholders.
Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court commented that if Owners and Thomas Cook
had presented yesterday's strategic plan and offer at the beginning of the
Airtours bid, then they would have been much better placed than now.
'As it is, it seems to be too little, too late and Airtours must be
favourite to win,' he said. Airtours shares jumped on news of the tender
offer, but faded to close steady at 327 1/2 p. Owners relinquished 3 to 141p
in turnover of 5.5m shares.
