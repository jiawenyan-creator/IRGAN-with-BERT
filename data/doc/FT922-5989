FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Creditors pierce the veil of
secrecy
OLYMPIA &amp; York's creditors are gradually stripping away the secrecy which
was once the hallmark of the debt-burdened property developer, writes
Bernard Simon.
The Toronto-based company, whose Canadian operations were placed under court
protection two weeks ago, has made public for the first time the cash flows
of its Canadian properties.
The data is contained in a 26-page affidavit submitted in response to a
court order which was granted last week at the request of the creditors. The
company was also due to provide various groups of lenders with more detailed
information by late yesterday, including projections of future cash flows.
An Ontario judge will hear arguments tomorrow on several other issues
critical to the company's debt restructuring.
The highest priority will be lenders' concern with the 'co-mingling' of
O&amp;Y's businesses in the US, Britain and Canada. The US and UK operations
remain outside the court protection granted under Canada's Companies
Creditors Arrangements Act. Lenders to the Canadian properties want the
court to put safeguards in place to prevent the company channelling income
to the Canary Wharf project in London or to cash-strapped US assets.
The court is expected to clarify the mandate of Mr Bernard Wilson, the Price
Waterhouse partner who was named as 'information officer' to liaise between
O&amp;Y and its lenders. Mr Wilson, whose fees will be paid by O&amp;Y, said he
plans to make several proposals to the court to facilitate his job.
The court will also consider motions from some lenders asking for
non-recourse companies secured by specific O&amp;Y properties to be released
from the CCAA order. The lenders, which include several European funds, had
been confident the structure of the single-purpose companies would insulate
them from the parent's problems.
