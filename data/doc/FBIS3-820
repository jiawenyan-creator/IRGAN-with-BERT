  [Text] The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has 
appointed a second administrator for Bophuthatswana and 
dissolved the homeland's parliament by decree. Earlier, 
President Lucas Mangope said his parliament would discuss 
participation in the April election today. However, the TEC 
said parliament would not meet today and that all cabinet 
members and MPs [Members of Parliament] were regarded as 
ordinary citizens without any access to state resources. 
  The appointment of Mr. Job Makgoro of the South African 
Development Bank as co-administrator followed objections by 
several organizations to the appointment of Dr. Tjaart van der 
Walt as administrator. Meanwhile the TEC's management committee 
and the South African Government have given assurances that the 
salaries and pensions of civil servants, policemen and soldiers 
were safe.
