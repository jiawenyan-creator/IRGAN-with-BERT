 

b. If control mortality exceeds 10% for either species in any 
test, the test(s) for that species (including the control) 
shall be repeated. A test will be considered valid only if 
control mortality does not exceed 10% for either species. 
2. The toxicity tests specified above shall be conducted once every 
month until three (3) valid monthly tests have been completed, 
and once every year thereafter for the duration of the permit, 
unless notified otherwise by the permit issuing authority. 
These tests are referred to as ``routine'' tests. 
3. a. If unacceptable acute toxicity (an LC

50

 of 100% or less 
occurs in either test species in any of the above-described 
tests within the specified time) is found in a ``routine'' 
test, the permittee shall conduct two additional acute 
toxicity tests in the same manner as the ``routine'' test on 
the specie(s) indicating unacceptable acute toxicity. For 
each additional test, the sample collection requirements 
and test acceptability criteria specified in Section 1 
above must be met for the test to be considered valid. The 
first test shall begin within two weeks of the end of the 
``routine'' tests, and shall be conducted weekly thereafter 
until two additional, valid tests are completed. The 
additional tests will be used to determine if the toxicity 
found in the ``routine'' test is still present. 

 
b. Results from additional tests, required due to unacceptable 
acute toxicity in the ``routine'' test(s), must be 

reported 


on the Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR) Form for the month 
in which the test was begun. Such test results must be 


submitted 

within 45 days of completion of the second 
additional, valid test. 



Part V 


Whole Effluent Toxicity Testing Program, Acute Saltwater Language 


As required by Part I of this permit, within 30-days after 
commencement of discharge, permittees discharging to marine 
waters, which are surface waters in which the chloride 
concentration at the surface is greater than or equal to 1500 
milligrams per liter, shall initiate the series of tests 
described below to evaluate whole effluent toxicity of the 
discharge from the outfall. If more than one (1) outfall exists, 
separate tests will be performed on each outfall. All test 
species, procedures and quality assurance criteria used shall be 
in accordance with 

Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of 
Effluents to Freshwater and Marine Organisms

, EPA/600/490/027F, 
or the most current edition. The dilution/control water and 
effluent used will be adjusted to a salinity of 20 parts per 
thousand using artificial sea salts as described in 
EPA/600/490/027F, Section 7 (or the most current edition). A 
standard reference toxicant quality assurance test shall be 
conducted concurrently with each species used in the toxicity 
tests and the results submitted with the discharge monitoring 
report (DMR). Alternatively, if monthly QA/QC reference toxicant 
tests are conducted, these results must be submitted with the 
DMR. 

 

1. a. The permittee shall conduct 96-hour acute static-renewal 
multi-concentration toxicity tests using the mysid 
shrimp (

Mysidopsis bahia

) and the inland silverside 
(

Menidia beryllina

). All tests shall be conducted on 
one grab sample of 100% final effluent. All tests shall 
be conducted on a control (0%) and the following 
dilution concentrations at a minimum: 100.0%, 50.0%, 
25.0%, 12.5%, and 6.25%. 
b. If control mortality exceeds 10% for either species in 
any test, the test(s) for that species (including the 
control) shall be repeated. A test will be considered 
valid only if control mortality does not exceed 10% for 
either species. 
2. The toxicity tests specified above shall be conducted once 
every month until three (3) valid monthly tests have been 
completed, and once every year thereafter for the duration of 
the permit, unless notified otherwise by the permit issuing 
authority. These tests are referred to as ``routine'' tests. 

3. a. If unacceptable acute toxicity (an LC

50

 of 100% or less 
occurs in either test species in any of the above- 
described tests within the specified time) is found in a 
``routine'' test, the permittee shall conduct two 
additional acute toxicity tests in the same manner as 
the ``routine'' test on the specie(s) indicating 
unacceptable toxicity. For each additional test, the 
sample collection requirements and test acceptability 
criteria specified in Section 1 above must be met for 
the test to be considered valid. The first test shall 
begin within two weeks of the end of the ``routine'' 
tests, and shall be conducted weekly thereafter until 
two additional, valid tests are completed. The 
additional tests will be used to determine if the 
toxicity found in the ``routine'' test is still present. 
b. Results from additional tests, required due to 
unacceptable acute toxicity in the ``routine'' 
test(s), must be 

reported 

on the Discharge 
Monitoring Report (DMR) Form for the month in which 
the test was begun. Such test results must be 


submitted

 within 45 days of completion of the 
second additional, valid test.
