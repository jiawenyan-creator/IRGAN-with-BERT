BUSH TO END CAPITAL GAINS FIGHT IF U.S. DEFAULT LOOMS 
The Bush Administration will abandon its proposed capital-gains tax cut if 
faced with the threat of the government's defaulting on its loans, a Treasury 
Department official said today. 
"If it were literally a choice between capital gains and default, obviously 
Treasury would not allow default," Undersecretary Robert R. Glauber told a 
House Ways and Means subcommittee. 
Glauber responded only after considerable prodding by Democratic members of the 
oversight subcommittee. They fear that efforts by Senate Republicans to add a 
capital-gains cut to a bill extending the government's borrowing authority 
could jeopardize that bill and push the government toward default next week. 
Meantime, President Bush told a news conference, "I plan to fight for my 
position" favoring a capital-gains tax cut. "It's something that's good for 
growth . . . investment . . . jobs," he said. 
Capital gains are profits from the sales of investments such as real estate and 
securities. They are now taxed at the same rate as other income. A House-passed 
bill, which Bush endorses, would create a lower rate for capital gains for 2 
1/4 years and then permanently adjust the tax system so that gains caused 
solely by inflation were not taxed. 
Capital gains has become the dominant issue before Congress. Bush's push for 
the tax cut against opposition of Democratic leaders has blocked action on a 
$16-billion deficit-reduction bill, on legislation to boost aid to Poland and 
Hungary and on the measure raising the government's debt ceiling.
