FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Danka
A substantial rise in turnover helped Danka, the office equipment supply and
servicing group that operates mainly in the US, to a 71 per cent pre-tax
profits increase in the first quarter to June 30.
Turnover, which rose from Pounds 64.6m to Pounds 116m, increased partly on
the back of acquisitions made the previous year, but Mr Dan Doyle, chief
executive, said there was also a 12 per cent sales growth in core
operations.
Pre-tax profits advanced from Pounds 6m to Pounds 10.3m.
Earnings per share were 3.5p (2.8p).
