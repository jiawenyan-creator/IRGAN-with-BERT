FT  08 FEB 93 / Israeli anxiety at rising casualties
SEVEN Palestinians were shot dead and more than 70 wounded in the Israeli
occupied territories at the weekend, the latest convulsion in a spate of
violence that has undermined efforts to regenerate Middle East peace talks.
Left-wing ministers in the Labour-led coalition yesterday expressed concern
over a sharp rise in casualties in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Six people
were shot dead by troops in Gaza on Friday and Saturday, three when a
carload of armed men was intercepted and three in protests that followed.
One Palestinian was killed in Jerusalem last night. They brought to 79 the
number of Palestinians killed since the beginning of October last year and
38 since the expulsion of more than 400 alleged Islamic militants in
mid-December.
The figures include 10 children under the age of 15. Thirteen Israelis have
died in the same period.
Palestinian leaders have refused to accept a US-brokered Israeli compromise
allowing 101 of the deportees to return as sufficient for resumption of
peace talks.
They are demanding the return of all deportees and an end to deportations.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, reiterated yesterday that Israel would
retain the use of expulsions 'in case of extraordinary situations'. The army
brought five ill deportees back to Israel yesterday from a Lebanese
hospital.
Two Palestinian reporters working for Reuters were arrested by Israeli
soldiers in Gaza yesterday while covering unrest.
Officials said the two, repeatedly arrested in the past, were suspected of
incitement, but their colleagues alleged harassment.
