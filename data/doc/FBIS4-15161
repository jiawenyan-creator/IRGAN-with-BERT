  [Text] Compulsory certification of output is being 
introduced in Ukraine from 1 July 1994. Any goods designated 
for export must have a certificate authenticating their quality 
and bearing the relevant safety and ecology requirement. 
Ukraine's biggest trading partner, Russia, has already 
undertaken compulsory certification of export goods since the 
beginning of this year.
