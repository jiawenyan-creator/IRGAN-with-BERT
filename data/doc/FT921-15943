In the first of two programmes called Learning To Fail (7.50 BBC2) Sir Claus
Moser pursues his concern that British education fails to meet the needs of
most young people and the country. Bamber Gascoigne presents the three-part
documentary Brother Felix And The Virgin Saint (8.00 C4), telling of the
3,000-mile journey made in 1483 by a German Dominican monk who, having
fallen in love with St Catherine of Alexandria, set out to cross the Alps
and the Mediterranean in order to touch her bones.
Our Boys, made by Irish film maker Cathal Black, is described by BBC2 as
'provocative and unusual'. It seeks to illustrate what Black regards as one
of the chief causes of sectarian division and social conflict in Irish life:
the control of education by The Christian Brothers (9.45).
An Angel at My Table has already won great critical acclaim as an
autobiographical book describing the life of New Zealand writer Janet Frame,
and as a cinema movie which won eight prizes at the Venice festival. The
three-part mini-series starting today (10.00 C4) is the form in which Jane
Campion originally intended the film to be seen.
