FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Better time for Crown Eyeglass
DESPITE showing falls of 6 per cent in turnover and profit, Crown Eyeglass
is raising its dividend by 1p to 7p for the year ended March 28.
This is a reflection of the directors' confidence. Having established a
platform for growth over the last two years, they were now looking for a
period of controlled expansion.
In the opening two months of the current year profits were ahead of budget
and of last year, they said.
In 1992-93 turnover was Pounds 3.75m (Pounds 3.99m) and pre-tax profit
Pounds 423,000 (Pounds 451,000). Earnings per share were 15.3p (19.4p) and
the final dividend is 4.5p.
The USM-quoted group, which makes spectacles and ready made reading glasses,
had consolidated its position by opening six new retail franchises in the UK
and re-establishing itself in Sweden.
Start-up costs were incurred in Sweden. The third optical centre should open
next month and additional outlets were envisaged later in the year.
