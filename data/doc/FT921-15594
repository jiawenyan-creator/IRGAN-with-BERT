FT  09 JAN 92 / Solidarity calls strike over fuel price rises
POLAND'S 2m-strong Solidarity trade union yesterday called a one-hour
national strike for Monday to protest against energy price rises brought in
on January 1. The larger, left-wing OPZZ unions have threatened token
stoppages on Thursday.
This is the most serious challenge from the unions a Polish government has
faced since economic reforms began in autumn 1989. The new government has
threatened to quit if faced by a protracted national stoppage. It says the
energy price rises are an integral part of an interim three-month budget now
being debated in parliament which foresees a Zl 17,600bn (Pounds 890m)
deficit.
Mr Jerzy Kropiwnicki, labour minister, told the union leadership the
government would not rescind the rises, which double the cost of home
central heating, increase the price of gas by 70 per cent and electricity by
a fifth. 'If we were to suspend the rises, economic anarchy would ensue,' he
said in Gdansk.
