  [Excerpt] The information minister, Professor Jerry Gana, 
says the Federal Government will announce how long it will stay 
in office when the national constitutional conference concludes 
its assignment. He said though the tenure is expected to be 
short, it will depend on the outcome of the conference. 
Reporter Obeijina Ogba has the details. 
  [Begin Ogba recording] Professor Gana, who led the National 
Orientation Agency's campaign team to Kano today, said it is 
only fair that such a timetable be based on decisions of the 
national constitutional conference. The government, he said, 
cannot go ahead to organize local governments, governorships, 
national assembly or presidential elections when Nigerians (have 
doubts regarding) the political framework of Nigeria. He added 
that the government will honor the decisions of the conference.
