  [Text] The termination of deliveries of Turkmen gas to 
Ukraine has prompted a cut in the supply of gas to Azerbaijan by 
Russia, across whose territory the fuel passes in transit. The 
Russian side justifies its actions by claiming that it is 
impossible to guarantee the requisite volume of gas supplies 
owing to a sharp drop of pressure in the pipelines.
