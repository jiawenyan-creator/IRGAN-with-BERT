<DOCTITLE>Wyoming Interstate Company, Ltd.; Filing of Revised Tariff Sheets</DOCTITLE>



December 1, 1994.



Take notice that on November 29, 1994, Wyoming Interstate Company, Ltd. (WIC) filed a Motion To Place Rates Into Effect
accompanied by revised tariff sheets incorporating the new rates as revised to reflect a December 1, 1994 effective
date and a revised Annual Charge Adjustment (ACA) rate previously effective October 1, 1994. WIC states that on June
29, 1994, the Commission accepted WIC's rate filing, and suspended its effectiveness until December 1, 1994 (67 FERC
 61,390). WIC's motion places those higher rates into effect on December 1, 1994, subject to refund and other
conditions, and its revised tariff sheets include those which were suspended and with respect to which no compliance
changes were required by the Commission's June 29, 1994 order.

WIC states that copies of this filing have been served on WIC's jurisdictional customers and public bodies, and the
filing is available for public inspection at WIC's offices in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Regulatory Commission, 825 North
Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure (18 CFR Section 385.211). All such protests should be filed on or before December 8, 1994. Protests will
be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants
parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection
in the Public Reference Room.
