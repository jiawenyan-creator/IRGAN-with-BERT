  [Text] The security agencies have gathered important 
information in their search for the organization responsible for 
detonating explosive devices in front of banks. The security 
agencies have identified a large number of persons suspected of 
having carried out these operations and have arrested a number 
of them. 
  The leader of this organization has been identified and 
arrested in one of the governorates. He was found in possession 
of a large quantity of explosives and ammunition and a new plan 
for detonating devices with a timer that was used for the first 
time in the devices that exploded in al-Jizah last week. The 
arrested defendants gave detailed confession about their 
terrorist plan, which sought to create panic and instability in 
the Egyptian streets.
