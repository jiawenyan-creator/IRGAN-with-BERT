FT  15 JUL 92 / Tax tonic for stock market in Turkey
TURKEY has introduced tax reforms to give a boost to the country's
struggling stock exchange, and in turn increase revenue at a time of severe
budget constraints.
The reforms, from January 1993, are intended to revive market activity,
giving encouragement to investors and to companies considering equity
flotations.
There will be tax exemptions for mutual funds which are invested up to 25
per cent in the stock market. Income earned from the management of mutual
funds is also to be tax exempt, together with income on venture capital
funds and income on real estate funds. To continue to enjoy tax exemption on
sales of securities, a company will have to hold the assets for at least two
years. Income generated from sales of rights issues at a premium will also
be tax exempt.
In a bid to raise revenues the new law sets a minimum 23 per cent
corporation tax rate, compared with a basic rate of 46 per cent. Effective
corporate tax is around 10 per cent as companies are entitled to a series of
tax incentives which they use to reduce their tax liabilities.
Hitherto, the government's appetite for funds has provided banks and
corporations with low risk high yielding assets, but also served to put
upward pressure on interest rates, damaging the investment climate.
