CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SACRAMENTO; 
LOBBYIST JAILED IN CAPITOL GIFT SCANDAL 
Police arrested a Capitol lobbyist for allegedly arranging to have the home of 
Assemblyman Dominic L. Cortese (D-San Jose) painted for free, officials said. 
Carl Burg, 65, executive director of the Painting &amp; Decorating Contractors 
of California Inc., was booked into the Sacramento County Jail on suspicion of 
unlawfully arranging a gift through a third party to Cortese and released on 
$500 bail. 
If convicted of the misdemeanor, Burg could be sentenced to six months in jail 
and given a $10,000 fine. Dist. Atty. Steven White said Burg represented a 
painters' union that wanted a bill carried by Cortese to pass. Cortese issued a 
statement saying he was sorry to hear of Burg's arrest. "I cooperated fully 
with the attorney general's office on this matter. Several months ago the 
attorney general's office informed me that nothing was going to be pursued as 
to my involvement," Cortese said.
