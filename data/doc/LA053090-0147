NATION; 
KY. FIRST LADY RUNS FOR GOVERNOR 
First Lady Martha Wilkinson ended weeks of speculation about trying to succeed 
her husband as governor and filed papers forming a campaign committee today. 
Documents for the "Martha S. Wilkinson for Governor Committee" were signed and 
filed with the Kentucky Registry for Election Finance. 
Wilkinson had said she would consider entering the 1991 governor's race if her 
husband, Gov. Wallace Wilkinson, failed to get the General Assembly to pass a 
constitutional amendment allowing him to succeed himself.
