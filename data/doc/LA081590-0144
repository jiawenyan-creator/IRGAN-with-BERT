NATION; 
STATION HOLDS LINE, GETS NO GAS 
Gasoline station owner David Rice said he did not want to be a gas-gouger and 
rejected a price increase set by his distributor. Now he can't sell any gas at 
all. 
The distributor who supplies Rice's convenience store, Crossroads Trading Post, 
padlocked his gas pumps Monday. 
"I just did not want to be labeled as a gas-gouger and I wanted to do my part 
to keep gas prices down," Rice, 24, was quoted as saying in today's 
Winston-Salem Journal. 
Rice, who sells Exxon gasoline, said he agreed last week to increase his price 
for regular unleaded gasoline by 6 cents to $1.159 a gallon instead of by 8 
cents as the distributor, William Shell, wanted. 
Shell said he owns the pumps and the gasoline Rice sells and he locked the 
pumps.
