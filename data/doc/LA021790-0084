SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
A Soviet exhibition that was supposed to open Monday at the San Diego 
Convention Center has been delayed until Friday because a fire-extinguishing 
system in the special-events area failed to operate, said Donna Alm, a 
spokeswoman for the center. 
Dan Wilkens, spokesman for the San Diego Unified Port District, said the city's 
contractor did not release the special-events area to the Convention Center 
because a water-cannon test failed to meet the Fire Department's standards. 
"The water cannon, which looks like the end of a firefighter's hose, did not 
shoot water the distance it was supposed to and in the sufficient amounts 
required by the city's Fire Department," Wilkens said. 
Alm said a steel-framed tent will be put up on a 17,000-square-foot parking lot 
behind the Marriott Hotel and Seaport Village for the exhibit. 
The exhibit will include artwork, photographs and an audio-visual program about 
the Soviet Union. Fifty people accompanied the exhibition, which arrived in San 
Diego on Tuesday. 
The San Diego display will be the third and final showing of the exhibition in 
the United States, Alm said.
