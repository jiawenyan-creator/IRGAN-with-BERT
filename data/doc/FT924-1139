FT  19 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Panel insists on bid for Buckingham
The Takeover Panel has ruled that Jemma Trust and Naaz Holdings must make an
offer for Buckingham International, the hotels and nursing homes group,
under Rule 9 of the City code on takeovers and mergers.
The Panel has required a bid of 2.75p per ordinary share and 27.5p for each
Pounds 1 nominal of stock for the secured convertible loan stock 1995. The
bid should be made by the end of February 1993.
On December 7, it ruled that Jemma and Naaz were acting in concert in
Buckingham's shares. Naaz is a company owned by a trust of which Mr Nurdin
Jivraj, Buckingham deputy chairman, and Mr Nick Jivraj, his son and chief
executive, and their families are beneficiaries. A close relation of theirs
is beneficiary of a trust run by Jemma.
Naaz owns 29.6 per cent of Buckingham and Jemma 8.6 per cent, together
exceeding the 30 per cent level at which a takeover offer becomes mandatory.
