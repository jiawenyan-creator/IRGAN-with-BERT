  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 29 KYODO -- The main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party 
[of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] on Saturday [29 January] endorsed a 
compromise over political reform reached between Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono, officials of the 
parties said. 
  The LDP reached the accord at a meeting of the highest 
decision-making body of the Executive Council and the SDPJ, the 
largest force in the seven-party ruling coalition, at a meeting 
of members of both houses of the Diet. 
  Hosokawa and Kono reached a basic accord Friday night in 
eleventh-hour talks to break the impasse over the 
government-proposed political reform bills on which Hosokawa had 
staked his political career.
