FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Hermes proposes flotation for
the summer
HERMES, one of France's most famous luxury goods groups, plans to go public
this summer by floating part of its equity on the second market in Paris.
The flotation, details of which will be announced in Paris next week, will
mark the end of a tradition of independence for Hermes, which has been
controlled by the Hermes family since 1837 when Mr Thierry Hermes set up a
workshop to make horse harnesses in Paris.
However, the founding family, which owns just under 90 per cent of the
equity, is expected to retain control after the flotation. Companies need
only release a minimum of 10 per cent of their equity to join the second
market.
Hermes, best known for its silk scarves and leather products, has recently
been revitalised under the chairmanship of Mr Jean-Louis Dumas, the fifth
generation of the Hermes family to run the company. The group's sales rose
five-fold during the 1980s to peak at FFr2.56bn (Dollars 457m) in 1989.
Mr Dumas has pursued a strategy of aggressive international expansion,
combined with scrupulous quality control. Hermes operates at the top of the
luxury goods market. Its famous Kelly bags, named after Princess Grace of
Monaco, take 20 hours to make by hand, and cost at least FFr14,500.
