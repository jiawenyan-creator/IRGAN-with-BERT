BRIEFLY 
Mexico Takes Step to Privatize Banks: Eight years after banks were 
nationalized, the lower house of Mexico's congress -- the Chamber of Deputies 
-- approved a constitutional amendment to return them to private ownership. The 
measure, proposed on May 2 by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, now goes to 
the Senate, where its passage is virtually assured. A total of 31 state 
legislatures also must approve it.
