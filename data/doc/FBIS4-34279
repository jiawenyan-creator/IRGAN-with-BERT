  [Text] President Sixto Duran-Ballen has appointed Miguel 
Rosero Barba to be the new national police commander general. 
One of the new commander general's main tasks will be to 
strengthen ties with the media through open-door policies and by 
the necessary creation of a public relations division that will 
answer journalists' questions. 
  The new police commander general, Manuel Rosero, believes 
having the people's trust and confidence is an important 
condition for successful police work.
