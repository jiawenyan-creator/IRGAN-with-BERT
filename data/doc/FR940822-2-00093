 


As noted above, Congress passed the Rollup Reform Act subsequent to the receipt of the comment letters. The Rollup
Reform Act rendered moot many of the issues raised by commenters. The significant issues that were raised and not subsequently
mooted by the Rollup Reform Act are addressed below. In addition, the NASD also made several technical amendments
in response to the comment letters.

A. Right of Compensation Based on Appraisals





Kelly noted that some partnerships, 

e.g.

 oil and gas, already include requirements for a supporting appraisal underlying the exchange value determination.
Therefore, according to Kelley, the NASD's requirement that dissenters' rights of compensation be based on appraisal,
would give the dissenters the right to a second appraisal which would be ``redundant and wasteful.''



The NASD has stated that ``an appraisal that functions to determine the transaction's exchange value could also be
used to determine the value of dissenters's compensation so long as the appraisal is done in a manner consistent with
the appropriate industry practice.''



Hogan  Hartson argues that the appraisal rights provisions under new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i) should be clarified
to permit one partnership participating in a rollup to offer one type of right while another partnership may offer
another type of right, stating that such an option would be satisfactory from a fairness perspective.



New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i) does not by its terms prohibit structuring a rollup offering such that different rights
may be offered to different partnerships involved in the same transaction. Further, the ``other comparable rights''
provision in Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)c.3. allows for variations in structuring that, subject to NASD approval,
are indeed comparable to rights provided in the proposed rule change, including variations in form as well as substance.



B. Compensation of Dissenters





Two commentators
<FOOTCITE>52</FOOTCITE>
 expressed concern about the use of ``freely-tradable securities'' as compensation for dissenting limited partners,
pursuant to new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)a.

The use of a ``freely-tradable security'' as compensation is reasonable. The listing standards of the exchanges
and of Nasdaq should provide adequate protection against dilution when ``freely-tradable securities'' are offered
as compensation.



One the issue of valuation of the ``freely-tradable securities,'' the ABA voiced concern about the method that the
NASD will use to calculate the value of the securities that will be used as compensation. New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(i)
provides that the value of the freely-tradable security must be determined in relation to the last sale price ``in
the 20-day period following the effective date.'' The ABA noted that the ``effective date'' must refer to the effective
date of the registration statement rather than to the closing of the rollup occurs.''

C. Valuation Provisions





Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)a.2. provides that a rollup is presumed to be unfair if the general partner fails to follow
the valuation provision in the limited partnership agreement. The ABA pointed out that partnership agreements do
not contain such valuation provisions, and suggested revised language to accommodate such a contingency and permit
reliance on ``more favorable'' valuation provisions than those in limited partnership agreements ``if any.''



The NASD stated that it does not want to make determinations as to whether a proposed valuation method is more favorable
than those contained in limited partnership agreements to which investors have previously agreed. However, the
NASD amended its rule to clarify that Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)b.1. applies to rollups which contain valuation provisions.



Hogan  Hartson argues that the valuation requirements in new Subsections (b)(6)(C)(ii)a.2. and 3. should be
clarified by explanations of how valuation provisions of limited partnership agreements and utilization of current
value methodology can be both followed in the event of inconsistency, and requests that the NASD explain the meaning
of the terms ``current value'' and ``future value'' in new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)a.3.



The NASD believes that the use of a ``current value'' for evaluating equity interests of the roll-up partnerships
when determining the general partner's/sponsor's interest in the new entity is fair because the guesswork involved
in arriving at any ``future value'' estimate may prejudice the limited partners in favor of the general partners,
especially if the estimated value is exaggerated. However, the NASD also believes that the valuation of partnership
interests should be appropriate to the particular industry, and that is permissible, for example, to interpret ``current
value'' on a ``going concern'' or ``liquidation'' basis.



With regard to Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)a.2., the NASD generally believes that the fairest valuation method of all
is that method which reflects, as much as possible, the original agreement or contract between the general partner/sponsor
and limited partners. However, the NASD believes that if the valuation provisions of the existing partnership agreements
require a future valuation of general partner interests which would be inconsistent with the proposed rule change's
requirement that current value be used, then the requirement to use current value supersedes the requirement to follow
valuation models in the original partnership agreements.




D. Voting Rights





When the proposed rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 the Commission specifically sought comment on any potential conflicts between the NASD's proposal and state contract
or corporate law. The Commission received four comment letters concerning a conflict between the voting rights provision
of proposed Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)b.2. and state corporate law.
<FOOTCITE>54</FOOTCITE>
 The NASD amended its rule to make it clear that it would not conflict with or supersede state corporate law. In response
to the Commission's concerns and the comment letters received, the NASD amended its rule to make it clear that the rule
would not conflict with or preempt state corporate law.

it does not conflict with the laws of some states, such as Massachusetts.

Additionally, the term ``management'' in Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)2.C. was replaced with the phrase ``general
partner, board of directors, trustee, or similar governing entity'' to comport with the introductory clause of Subsection
(b)(6)(C)(ii)2.C. See Amendment No. 6.


</FOOTNOTE>



Hogan  Hartson argued that the Rollup Reform Act did not mandate that the NASD impose specific voting rights,
especially for the operating partnership in UPREITs, because very few partnership agreements provide for such rights
in any case.



The Commission believes that the proposed rule change does not impose specific voting rights. First, as noted above,
the rule is drafted in a manner that defers to applicable state law. Second, if the NASD staff determines that a particular
voting arrangement is presumptively unfair or unreasonable, the member may nonetheless rebut the presumption if
it demonstrates that the arrangement is not unfair or unreasonable or that the arrangement does not come within one
of the enumerated unfair and unreasonable arrangement provisions.




E. Transaction Costs





New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)c. requires that transaction costs be apportioned according to voting so that, in a
rejected rollup transaction, the general partner bears the costs of the transaction in proportion to the total number
of rejections and abstentions. the IPA suggested that it was inappropriate to require the general partner to bear
the cost of a rejected rollup transaction in proportion to abstentions.
<FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>





<FOOTNOTE>

Hogan  Hartson argued that the Rollup Reform Act does not mandate that the general partner or sponsor bear all
the costs of a rejected transaction. However, new Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)c.1. does not require the general partner/sponsor
to bear ``all'' costs of a rollup transaction that is not approved, but only those costs in proportion to the total number
of abstentions and votes to reject the transaction; limited partners bear costs in proportion to the number or votes
to approve the transaction.


</FOOTNOTE>



The Commission disagrees. In proposing Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)c., the NASD stated that it intended to ``encourage
general partners to structure a fair transaction that will be approved by limited partners.'' By placing the transaction
costs of a rejected rollup on the general partner or the sponsor, the NASD is imposing the appropriate burden on the
general partner or sponsor to structure a rollup in a manner intended to secure as many favorable votes as possible.




F. Fees to the General Partner





New Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)d. sets forth criteria to use in determining whether fees paid to the general partner
in a rollup are presumptively unfair. Subsection (b)(6)(C)(iv)3. provides that changes in fees which are substantial
and adverse to limited partners are presumed unreasonable if not submitted to or approved by an independent party.
In order to simplify compliance with the terms of Subsection (b)(6)(C)(ii)(4)(C), the IPA suggested that the NASD,
in addition to an independent committee, be permitted to approve changes in fees which are substantial and adverse
to limited partners.



In its response to this comment the NASD stated that it is not appropriate for the NASD to make a determination to approve
fees that are substantial or adverse to the limited partners.
