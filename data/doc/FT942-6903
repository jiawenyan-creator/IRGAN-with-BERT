FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: MoDo back in black for quarter
MoDo, the Swedish pulp and paper group, yesterday announced its first
quarterly profit since 1991 and upgraded its forecast for the full-year.
The group made a profit of SKr202m (Dollars 26m), after net financial items,
against a year-earlier loss of SKr181m.
It said its full-year profit would be 'well above' SKr1bn, compared to last
year's SKr449m loss. The group's B shares rose SKr7 to SKr318.
Mr Bernt Lof, chief executive, said that although prices were rising, they
had a limited impact. The upturn was mainly due to higher volumes, better
capacity utilisation and cost-cutting. The group also benefited from lower
interest rates and reduced net debt.
Sales rose to SKr4.57bn from SKr4.32bn, while operating profit improved to
SKr433m from SKr131m. The group's Swedish units lifted operating profit to
SKr483m from SKr284m, due to better market conditions and higher capacity
utilisation. Foreign units improved, but were dragged down by the French
operations where losses almost halved to SKr75m from SKr142m.
All the group's divisions improved their operating performance, although
MoDo Paper and MoDo Packaging were still marginally in the red. Iggersund
Paperboard was the biggest contributor, lifting its profit contribution to
SKr174m from SKr104m.
Unitas, the Finnish banking group, yesterday announced an 18 per cent
reduction in operating losses for the first four months to FM358m (Dollars
66m), compared with FM435m in the same 1993 period.
Credit losses rose to FM976m from FM846m reflecting the continuing
difficulties of companies in the Finnish domestic sector.
