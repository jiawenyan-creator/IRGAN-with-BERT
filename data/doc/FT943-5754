FT  02 SEP 94 / Church panel appoints surveyor
The Church Commissioners, the body which administers pensions and pay for
the Church of England clergy and its dependents, has appointed a
professional chief surveyor to manage its Pounds 1.2bn portfolio.
It is understood that Mr Andrew Brown, a partner at London chartered
surveyors St Quintin, was selected last month and will take up the post in
October.
Neither Mr Brown nor the Church Commissioners, which serves as a cross
between a pension fund and a private investment trust, would confirm the
appointment.
The appointment will fulfil a recommendation in the Lambeth Report, which
was commissioned in 1992 by the archbishop of Canterbury to look into the
Church's financial affairs. This followed a series of decisions to expand
its property holdings in the 1980s which led to an Pounds 800m loss.
The report advised the commissioners to hire a professional for the job,
formerly held by a commercial property manager with no professional
qualifications.
