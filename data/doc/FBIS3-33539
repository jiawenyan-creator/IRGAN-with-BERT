  [Text] We will now contact the main engineer at the Mario 
Fortuny Manufactured Gas Plant, comrade (Raul Itina), who will 
give us the latest information on the gas service outage in the 
capital. Good evening, Raul. 
  [(Itina)] Good evening. We are advising you on the situation 
that came up today with regard to supplying the population of 
the city of Havana with manufactured gas. 
  At approximately 0500 this morning, we had an electricity 
outage on both of the circuits that supply the Mario Fortuny gas 
plant with electricity. This breakdown has dragged on because 
one of the electrical substation's transformers has been 
damaged. The comrades from the power company have been working 
on this (?since) very early this morning, and they continue to 
work to solve this situation. 
  As a consequence of this event, gas service has been 
seriously affected today. Sometime tonight -- we think that as 
of 2030, between 2030 and 2100, when the comrades finish -- we 
are going to resume supplying gas, although the service will be 
deficient because the electric company's work is going to 
continue tomorrow, until it is finished. (?Thus), we ourselves 
should be able to normalize the situation sometime tomorrow 
afternoon. 
  That is the information we wanted to give the population.
