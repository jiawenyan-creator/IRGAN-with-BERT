FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Axa to invest Dollars 10m in
Turkish investment fund venture
Axa, one of France's largest insurance groups, is planning to start
operations in Turkey next year as part of its policy of international
expansion.
The group, which bucked the trend in the French insurance sector by recently
reporting half-year net group profits up 26 per cent to FFr1.5bn (Dollars
290m), plans to invest Dollars 10m in a joint venture with Oyak, the Turkish
investment fund to begin in April next year.
The investment is one of several designed to broaden the group's
international basis, said Mr Claude Tondil, director in charge of
international development.
The company is also set to launch a direct marketing company to sell
insurance in Germany. 'Germany is a more difficult market to penetrate than
Japan,' said Mr Tondil, referring to the group's recently-boosted operations
in Asia Pacific.
While other French insurance companies are holding back from additional
international investment, Mr Tondil said Axa was looking for new
acquisitions in Europe, Asia and North America.
He said about 60 per cent of Axa's premium income was generated in France.
Mr Tondil said he was also looking in the UK for additional property and
casualty interests, but British insurers were too over-valued.
In North America, he said Axa was interested in expanding only cautiously,
avoiding the natural-disaster prone regions, such as Florida and California.
