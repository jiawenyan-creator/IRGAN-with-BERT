FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Austrian building group advances
Maculan, the Austrian building group with significant interests in eastern
Germany, reported an 11.6 per cent rise in 1993 net income to Sch260m
(Dollars 179.3m) on turnover up 19 per cent to Sch13.9bn.
The group said business growth had been strongest in Austria, due to buoyant
residential construction, and in eastern Germany, partly due to the
first-time consolidation of 90 per cent owned TB Tief-und Verkehrsbau
Berlin.
Turnover in the former Soviet Union fell by about a third. Maculan has filed
a force majeure claim with the German government over a Sch1.9bn contract
for a Russian military housing project financed by Bonn.
The project has been delayed by spiralling costs due to inflation and the
declining value of the rouble.
The group, which has grown rapidly in the past five years, said its primary
focus in the current year would be 'consolidation and optimisation of
existing activities'. Still, it expected both turnover and earnings to grow
by about 10 per cent.
Orders on hand at March 31 were 10 per cent lower at Sch9.4bn because of the
removal of the Russian contract.
Current orders represent eight months' work.
