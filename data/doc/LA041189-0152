P.M. BRIEFING; 
JUDGE BACKS CASE AGAINST DREXEL 
The government is free to seek the indictment of Drexel Burnham Lambert for 
racketeering and securities fraud because the firm has failed to reach a 
required settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a federal 
prosecutor said today. 
Drexel agreed in December to plead guilty to six felonies and pay $650 million 
to avoid an indictment under the racketeering statute. Such an indictment, 
which would have to be made by a grand jury, would have dire consequences for 
Drexel because it would allow the government to seize assets even before a 
trial begins. 
The agreement with the U.S. attorney's office cannot become final unless Drexel 
reaches a settlement with the SEC in a separate civil case brought against the 
investment banker. Talks on settling these charges have been going on for 
months without success.
