FT  01 FEB 92 / Yeltsin shines on international debut
MR BORIS Yeltsin made all the right noises on his international debut
yesterday.
He spoke of making democracy irreversible; he promised a new Russian
diplomacy; and he unveiled an ambitious if vague proposal for a new global
space-based anti-missile system conditional on co-operation with the US.
'We do not want to be mere partners, we want to be allies,' he said.
The Russian president has been speaking this language all week, starting
with his visit to London. But in the forum of the United Nations Security
Council, his words took on special significance.
Just 30 years ago, Nikita Khrushchev banged his shoe on a rostrum at the UN,
an enduring image of the cold war rivalry between the US and the (then)
super power, the Soviet Union.
The UN Security Council meeting yesterday marked a turning point. An attempt
by the great powers to begin creating a new world order from communism's
collapse.
Mr Yeltsin pledged that a new democratic Russia would play a full role in
this joint effort, based on collective security. He pointedly drew a
difference between pre- and post-communist Russia and the totalitarian
Soviet Union. This was his best effort to date at convincing an audience of
world leaders of his country's (and his own) democratic credentials.
The script was flawless. He pledged to enshrine human rights protection in
law, to respect the primacy of democracy and to create new political and
legal institutions to make the process irreversible. 'There is now a real
chance to put an end to despotism,' he said.
