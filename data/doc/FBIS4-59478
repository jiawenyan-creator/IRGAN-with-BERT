  [Jabr] Good evening. 
  [Mu'addi] How is the situation two days after your

of power in Jericho?

Authority departments are performing their normal duties.

streamline work so that the various departments will continue to 
serve the citizens.

in the self-rule area. 
  [Mu'addi] What is the present degree of cooperation between 
the Palestinian police and the Israeli authorities? 
  [Jabr] Cooperation is going on normally on joint patrols and 
liaison. We solve every problem that faces us. Thus far, I can 
say there is positive cooperation between the Israeli side and 
us. 
  [Mu'addi] Is there a red line or a red telephone between the 
two sides? 
  [Jabr] Actually, there is direct contact through the liaison 
officers.

Jericho? 
  [Jabr] We are doing our best to redeploy in accordance with 
our security arrangements. 
  [Mu'addi] What about the inhabitants' response and 
cooperation with the Palestinian police force? 
  [Jabr] Cooperation is very good. There was a great joy over 
the people's return to their homeland; they were greatly 
welcomed back home. Great joy is prevailing in the entire 
region as well as in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
  [Mu'addi] What measures will be taken with regard to 
reporters and Israelis who wish to enter the city of Jericho? 
  [Jabr] It is natural that reporters and Israelis are welcome 
as agreed upon.
