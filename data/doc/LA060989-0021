CAMARILLO PAIR SELECTED IN LATE ROUNDS OF DRAFT 
Infielders Scott Cline and Charlie Fiacco of UCLA and Camarillo High have been 
selected in baseball's amateur draft despite injury-shortened senior seasons. 
Cline was selected in the 26th round by the Milwaukee Brewers, and the Chicago 
Cubs made Fiacco a 36th-round pick. Cline sustained knee and wrist injuries 
this spring and batted .295 in limited action for UCLA. He finished his college 
career with a .313 average, 24 home runs and 130 runs batted in. 
Fiacco, who missed the last 18 games of the season after undergoing knee 
surgery, batted .320 and led the Bruins in home runs (seven) and RBIs (38). 
Notre Dame High's Chris Lohman was selected in the 56th round by Oakland, 
Newbury Park High's Danny Madsen was taken by Texas in an unspecified late 
round and Rod Stillwell of Arkansas and Thousand Oaks High was taken in an 
unspecified late round by Kansas City. Rod's brother, Kurt, plays shortstop for 
the Royals. 
Lohman, an outfielder, batted .472 with 35 RBIs and 15 stolen bases. Madsen, a 
catcher who batted .372 with a school-record 36 RBIs, said he will probably not 
sign and will play at Ventura College.
