FT  01 DEC 93 / International Company News: Dell Computer reverses losses in
third quarter
Dell Computer reported much higher than expected earnings for the three
months to end-October, reversing losses in the first two quarters of its
fiscal year as it restructured its operations.
Net income was Dollars 12m or 26 cents a share, against Dollars 28.6m or 72
cents in the same period last year. Revenues rose to Dollars 757.3m from
Dollars 570m. .
Analysts had been anticipating further losses and Dell's share price gained
Dollars 3 to close at Dollars 27 1/8 yesterday.
However, Dell said it no longer expected to achieve fourth-quarter earnings
above those of last year's final quarter and its original goal of reaching
Dollars 3bn in sales for the year now 'looks too aggressive'.
Dell achieved revenue growth despite the withdrawal of its notebook computer
products in August, due to design flaws. Notebook sales in the quarter were
Dollars 5m, compared with Dollars 62m last year. It intends to re-enter the
notebook market in the next fiscal year.
For the nine months, sales were Dollars 2.1bn, up from Dollars 1.4bn last
year. Net losses were Dollars 53.5m, or Dollars 1.48, against net income of
Dollars 70.4m or Dollars 1.81.
