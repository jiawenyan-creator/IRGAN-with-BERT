MORE ROUGH WEATHER FOR THE B-2 
Washington's General Accounting Office argues that further production of the 
B-2 Stealth bomber should be put on hold until the Pentagon knows whether the 
airplane will work. Congress should do just that. 
Last week's GAO report will of course ignite a debate of the chicken-or-egg 
variety. Supporters of the B-2 will argue that stalling production for the 
three years it will take to complete testing will make the plane more expensive 
than it already is (something over $70 billion for a fleet of 132 planes). But 
the GAO report says that costs are already over that estimate, and the only 
question is how much higher they would go if production were stretched out. The 
GAO says, for example, that in less than 31 hours of testing, problems have 
already been found in the plane's electronic system. 
The argument of backers of the B-2 is valid only if one assumes that the plane 
will perform exactly as the Air Force wants it to -- an assumption that is hard 
to swallow when one considers the problem-plagued performance of the last fleet 
of bombers the Pentagon bought, the B-1b. This plane simply cannot fly some of 
the missions it was designed for. Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the 
House Armed Services Committee, says that it never will. 
That's an arguable point, but even if the B-2 bomber turned out perfectly, it 
would not answer the many questions about whether the United States needs a 
fleet of bombers that have been designed to swoop down on targets without 
warning because they are invisible to radar. After all, the Pentagon has yet to 
describe, at least publicly, any target for the B-2 that could not be reached 
by other weapons systems already in service. And with Washington and Moscow 
pressing forward to new arms-control agreements, the number of potential 
targets presumably will be going down, not up. All this means that the 
rationale for the B-2 is decreasing, not increasing.
