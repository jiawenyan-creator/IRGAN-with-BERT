FT  23 OCT 92 / British legal system too expensive
BRITAIN can no longer afford its current legal system, Lord Alexander,
chairman of National Westminster Bank, told the conference.
Pressures on public and private funds emphasised the need for a system that
was more streamlined and accessible and less expensive.
He called for early disclosure of the defence case in criminal trials in
order to focus legal aid on issues central to the case.
