<F P=106> [Address by ANC President Nelson Mandela after casting his </F>
vote at Ohlange Institute, north of Durban, Natal, on 27 April] 
  [Text] Well, as you might expect, this is, for all South 
Africans, an unforgettable occasion. It is the realization of 
hopes and dreams that we have cherished over decades. The 
dreams of a South Africa which represents all South Africans. 
It is the beginning of a new era. We have moved from an era of 
pessimism, division, limited opportunities, turmoil, and 
conflict. We are starting a new era of hope, of reconciliation, 
of nation-building. 
  We sincerely hope that by the mere casting of a vote the 
results will give hope to all South Africans and will make us, 
all South Africans, realize that this is our country, we are one 
nation. 
  Our message is that the basic needs of the masses of the 
people must be addressed: the creation of jobs, of houses, the 
introduction of electricity, building of schools and hospitals, 
providing free, compulsory quality education running water, 
paved roads. 
  These are our priorities, but we are also concerned about 
the 
minorities in the country, especially the white minority. We 
are concerned about giving confidence and security to those who 
are worried that by these changes they are now going to be in a 
disadvantageous position. 
  I again repeat that I have, throughout my life, as I pointed 
out in the Rivonia trial, I have fought very firmly against 
white domination. I have fought very firmly against black 
domination. I cherish the idea of a new South Africa where all 
South Africans are equal, where all South Africans work together 
in order to bring about security, peace, and democracy in our 
country. I sincerely hope that the mass media will use its 
powerful position to ensure that democracy is installed in this 
country, and I thank you.
