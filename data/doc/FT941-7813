FT  23 FEB 94 / Arts: The Madness of Esme and Shaz - Fringe theatre
Here is the sitcom recipe: take two characters and arrange them so they
cannot live together and cannot live apart; blend them together, make them
unpredictable enough to change, but staid enough to remain the same. It
works with serious ingredients, too. But The Madness of Esme and Shaz by
Sarah Daniels at the Royal Court Upstairs is a good dish which stays too
long on the table; it starts hot and goes cold.
Esme, a retired civil servant, finds she has a niece called Sharon ('Shaz')
who has been in a secure psychiatric hospital for 13 years and is now due
for release. She offers her home to Shaz, whose swearing, smoking, drinking
and lesbianism at first seem like an affront to everything the God-fearing
Esme values.
A battle of wills begins, and a sad mutual past of child abuse emerges. A
partner of Shaz crosses their lives briefly, putting the feminist view of
men who abuse children: 'Most women are locked up just for losing their
temper.' At this point the play works well, the dialogue is trenchant and
witty, and the characters well defined.
But then Shaz, in a fine scene from the local Benefit Office, assaults a
police officer, and is sent back to the secure unit. Esme buys a replica
gun, sells her flat, rents a car she cannot drive, and springs Shaz from
jail to take her to a new life on the Greek islands - Mytilene, now Lesbos,
home of Sappho.
The central performances rather than the central characters carry the play.
Marlene Sidaway as Esme makes her grow and change in the direction of her
niece; she finds warmth and scope in a difficult part. Tanya Ronder as Shaz
is all angst and aggression, restless on stage and using her whole body to
play the part.
The versatile set (Kate Owen) is a triptych of doors and a raised platform
which keeps the action clean. Jessica Dromgoole directs.
