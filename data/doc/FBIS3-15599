<F P=106> [Video interview with S. Ryazantsev, member of Sakhalin </F>
Oblast election commission; by unidentified reporter; from the 
"Dalniy Vostok" program; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] The attempt by Sakhalin residents to create a 
bicameral oblast parliament was not successful. The oblast was 
corrected by Moscow. 
  [Begin recording] [Ryazantsev] The Moscow authorities 
wanted, 
on one hand, to box our ears and put the regions in their place 
so that they would not act too independently, and on the other 
hand, the goal is probably to whittle down our representative 
power and reduce it, making it into some kind of decorative 
screen. 
  Frankly, my first emotional response was as follows: If 
Article 77 of the Russian Constitution, which postulates that 
nomination of oblast and kray authorities is the prerogative of 
federation members, is being directly violated here, then we 
should not do it, we should just distance ourselves from it and 
not do such work. But on the other hand, the representative 
power has to be elected. Even if I and other members of the 
commission leave, the elections still need to be carried out. 
The only thing we will accomplish is making the elections more 
difficult. 
  [Reporter] So you are staying? 
  [Ryazantsev] For the time being, I am, and I think that 
other 
members of the election committee also are not seriously 
considering leaving. But like an aftertaste, a very bitter 
residue remains. [end recording]
