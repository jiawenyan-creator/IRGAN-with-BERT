FT  16 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Unnerving aspect of fiscal policy
Sir, Detailed reading of the Budget Red Book raises questions about the
Treasury's conduct of fiscal policy which go much deeper than the pattern of
tax and expenditure changes which have taken the political spotlight. The
assumption seems to be that changes in taxation or expenditure do not affect
demand, output or employment, and that the pace of recovery is something to
be forecast, but not susceptible to human intervention.
It is unnerving that in a deep recession the Budget can take an extra Pounds
5.5bn out of the economy in an effort to reduce the public sector borrowing
requirement without consideration of effects on demand. It is also
symptomatic that neither the text nor the tables indicate any interest in
the level of unemployment: it is the one important economic variable not
forecast, merely assumed to remain virtually constant.
As Samuel Brittan commented (Economic Viewpoint, December 2), the Treasury
has reverted to the pre-Keynesian orthodoxy of the 1920s which had such
disastrous results. To have held such views then may be excusable, but to
shrug off any responsibility for demand management today amounts to
professional incompetence.
