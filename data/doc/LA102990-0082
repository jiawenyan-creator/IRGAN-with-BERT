ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 
SCHOOL OFFICIALS TO MONITOR PROP. 146 
On Election Day, officials of the Santa Ana Unified School District will be 
paying close attention to the fate of Proposition 146, an $800-million 
statewide school construction bond measure that could give the district some 
much-needed financial help to build new schools. 
Last week, the district's school board unanimously passed a resolution in 
support of the measure and later complained about the lack of attention the 
proposition has received. 
"It's ridiculous that the way a proposition gets passed has to do with the 
amount of money in the campaign war chest," school board President Audrey 
Yamagata-Noji said. "We don't have another viable funding measure, and passage 
of this proposition is critical for us in this community." 
Only about $35,000 has been available to run the statewide campaign for the 
proposition, said Peter Birdsall, campaign manager of the Sacramento-based "Yes 
on 146" campaign. 
"It's a very low figure to deal with," Birdsall said. "That amount is only a 
little more than what it costs to run a 30-second commercial on prime-time 
television." 
The district, the largest in Orange County with 43 schools, is in the midst of 
a $225-million school construction program that has schools being built at a 
rate of about two per year. 
The new schools are needed to house a student population that has been growing 
at a rate of about 1,000 students annually. The district has added hundreds of 
portable classrooms to school sites and has placed some schools on a year-round 
calendar to ease overcrowding.GREG HERNANDEZ
