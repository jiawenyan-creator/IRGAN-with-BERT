FT  14 MAY 92 / LSE planning permission
THE London School of Economics' plan to move to County Hall, home of the
former Greater London Council, won planning permission from Lambeth Council
yesterday.
The building, owned by the London Residuary Body, was sold in March to
Shirayama, the Japanese property developer. The contract gives Mr Michael
Howard, environment secretary, the option until next October of cancelling
the deal.
