  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa will hold a summit meeting in Washington with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton on February 11 as scheduled, the chief 
government spokesman said Monday [24 January]. 
  Doubts had been raised about the meeting amid political 
uncertainty in Japan following Friday's rejection of crucial 
political reform bills by the House of Councillors, But Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told reporters at a regular 
news conference, "the schedule remains unchanged." 
  The summit will center on bilateral framework trade talks 
aimed at expanding access for imports to the Japanese market. 
  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said in Tokyo on 
Sunday 
that the United States may "reexamine" the stalled trade talks 
if no agreement is reached before next month's summit. Hosokawa 
and Clinton agreed on the February summit when they met in the 
U.S. city of Seattle during the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation session there in November.
