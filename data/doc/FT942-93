FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: North West Water's Pounds 672,000 pay-out
to former executive
Mr Bob Thian, the former chief executive of North West Water who left the
company abruptly in November last year, has been awarded a compensation
package worth Pounds 672,095.
The pay-off, details of which are given in the company's annual report,
consists of Pounds 398,400 - which includes Pounds 60,000 relating to his
pension arrangements - plus an option on 157,000 shares.
Mr Thian was granted 143,750 shares at 278p on January 30 1990 and a further
13,250 at 315.5p on December 3 1990.
The shares closed at 467p yesterday.
At the time of Mr Thian's resignation, the company said he had left over a
'difference in management styles' between the chief executive and the board.
It was widely believed that the relationship between Mr Thian and Sir
Desmond Pitcher, the chairman, was particularly strained.
Sir Desmond has been awarded a pay package worth Pounds 338,000, a 42 per
cent increase over the package paid to the previous chairman, Mr Dennis
Grove.
Mr Thian joined the privatised water utility in January 1990 and was the
architect of its international water and waste water business.
He had a three-year rolling contract.
Mr Thian was succeeded earlier this year by Mr Brian Staples, former head of
Tarmac's contracting businesss.
