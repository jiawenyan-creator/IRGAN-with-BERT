 Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 The Railroad Retirement Board (Board) amends its regulations establishing fees to be assessed in connection with
the search for records and provision of documents by the Board. The regulations provide that the fees will be based
on the salaries of the employees who ordinarily perform the searches.

<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 Title 5 U.S.C. 552(a) requires the promulgation of a regulation specifying the schedule of fees applicable to the
processing of requests for information. These fees are to provide for the recovery of the direct costs of search, duplication,
and review. The fees previously provided for in 200.4(g)(1) no longer reflect the actual costs of processing
requests for information and do not include fees for specific methods of transmittal of documents. The Board is amending
its regulation to update the fees by establishing criteria for determining fees so that the fees will automatically
change with changes in Federal salaries. In addition, the Board is increasing the fees found in section 200.4(g) and
is adding a new paragraph to provide a charge for transmittal of documents by other than regular post.



On January 14, 1994, the Board published this rule as a proposed rule (59 FR 2317), inviting comments on or before February
14, 1994. No comments were received. The final rule differs from the proposed rule in that we have deleted specific
salary amounts to be assessed for search and review and substituted therefor language that will allow these fees to
rise with salary rate increases. Also the maximum computer search charge has been reduced from that in the proposed
rule in accordance with more current information.

The Board, with the concurrence of the Office of Management and Budget, has determined that this is not a significant
regulatory action for purposes of Executive Order 12866. Therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required.
There are no information collections associated with this rule.
