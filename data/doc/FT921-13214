FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Regulators remove HLT definition
US BANKING regulators announced yesterday they intend to phase out 'highly
leveraged transaction' definition and to end reporting requirements for HLT
loans after June 30.
A joint statement from the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
claimed the HLT definition had served its purpose. It had 'focused attention
on the need for banks to have strong internal controls for HLTs and to
structure HLT credits in a way that was consistent with the risks involved.'
The regulators added they recognised the HLT definition might be having an
'undue effect on pricing and availability for credit to certain highly
leveraged borrowers.' They would still scrutinise HLTs in bank examinations.
The idea of formally categorising deals as 'HLTs' if they met certain
criteria began in 1989 when regulators were worried about the amount of bank
lending to over-leveraged companies. The definition was refined, but
basically covered financing for buy-outs, acquisitions or recapitalisations
which pushed the borrower's liabilities-to-assets ratio beyond 75 per cent,
or which doubled the borrower's liabilities and sent the
liabilities-to-assets ratio over 50 per cent.
However, as analysts' worries about banks with high levels of HLT loans
grew, lending to HLT situations dried up and critics of the HLT definition
claimed some potentially sound borrowers were being unfairly stigmatised. In
July, the regulators asked for public comment on the definition.
Although eliminating the definition was always an option, it has been
suggested such a move might engender opposition from the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
