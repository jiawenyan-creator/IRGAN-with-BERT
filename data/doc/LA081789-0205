P.M. BRIEFING; 
3 ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS SUE EXXON FOR BILLIONS TO RESTORE FOULED AREAS 
Exxon Corp. should be forced to pay billions of dollars to restore Alaskan 
areas fouled by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, three environmental groups said 
today in announcing a lawsuit against the company. 
The suit was to be filed later in the day in Alaska Superior Court. 
It seeks to force Exxon and the Alyeska pipeline company to finance the cleanup 
and restoration of the environment through an independently supervised trust 
fund after the March 24 tanker spill of about 11 million gallons of oil into 
Alaska's once-pristine Prince William Sound. 
"We expect that the fund will amount to billions of dollars," said Sharon 
Newsome, vice president of the National Wildlife Federation. Other participants 
in the suit are the Wildlife Federation of Alaska and the Natural Resources 
Defense Council. 
The suit also seeks punitive damages against the companies, alleging that they 
engaged in fraud and misrepresentation of their ability to react to a major oil 
spill. The damages would be paid into the fund. 
Exxon already faces 150 lawsuits, mainly by Alaskans whose livelihoods were 
impaired by the oil spill. In addition, the state of Alaska filed suit Tuesday 
seeking unspecified damages.
