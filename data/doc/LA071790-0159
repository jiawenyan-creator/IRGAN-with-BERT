NATION; 
DEBATE CAP PUT ON RIGHTS BILL 
Civil rights forces scored a victory today when the Senate voted to impose a 
30-hour limit on debate on a bill designed to combat discrimination in the 
workplace. 
Senators voted 62 to 38 to limit debate and avert a filibuster by critics, who 
say the bill would result in the widespread use of hiring quotas by American 
companies. 
"We can talk and talk indefinitely or we can act," said Sen. James M. Jeffords 
(R-Vt.), urging prompt action on the measure. 
Senators critical of the measure, however, took to the floor before the vote 
and scorned the effort to speed up action. 
They said additional time to debate was needed to purge the legislation of 
provisions that they said would not only lead to quotas but also impose an 
array of other hardships on employers.
