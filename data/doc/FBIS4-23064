  [Abstract] This article examines two problems in the 
propagation of laser radiation in a distributed feedback system: 
noise conversion and determination of the conditions in which it 
is possible to take quantum nondisruptive measurements (with 
Bragg diffraction) and experiment with the induction of 
hydrodynamic instabilities by light convection (Rayleigh-Benard) 
in an anisotropic liquid (classic examination). Emphasis is 
placed on the possibility of observing these fundamental states 
in the field of high-coherence stable continuous lasers. This is 
important in the development of optical computers and 
biocomputers. References 56: 41 Russian, 15 Western.
