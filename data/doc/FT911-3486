FT  24 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Kleinwort Benson
The depressing thing about the latest news from Kleinwort Benson is the
insight it gives into the board's thinking. When the bank announced its
dreadful results last month, one extra item would not have greatly altered
their reception. But it chose to wait until the report and accounts to
disclose the embarrassing write-off of Dollars 23m of loans to an obscure US
partnership controlled by one of its directors. Perhaps more embarrassingly
again, it had to pay a further Dollars 2.4m to the partnership when the loan
agreement was terminated.
The really damning thing from the commercial banking point of view is that
that the failed company invested in such areas as Californian real estate.
Money was still being advanced last year when the US property market was in
full retreat. Shareholders might also usefully raise the question of why
Kleinwort signed a severance agreement forbidding it to sue for redress.
