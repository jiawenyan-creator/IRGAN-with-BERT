 

Based on the discussion in Part IV.C.1.a-e, above, the Commission has determined to require, for multiple filament
lamps, the same disclosures required for a single filament lamp, i.e., energy used (in terms of wattage), light output
(in lumens), laboratory life (in hours) and the Advisory Disclosure. Consistent with the Light Bulb Rule, the Commission
has determined to require disclosure of wattage and light output for each light output level of a multiple filament
lamp. The Commission has determined to require disclosure of average laboratory life on the basis of the filament
that fails first, rather than on the major filament, as suggested by the comments.

132

 If the secondary filament routinely fails before the major filament, basing the life estimate on the major filament
would not be helpful to purchasers. For the reasons explained in Part IV.C.2.b, above, the Commission has determined
not to require energy operating cost information for multiple filament lamps. See 305.11(e)(1)(G) in ``Text
of Amendments,'' below.

4. Additional Disclosures Recommended for Compact Fluorescent Lamps 


Several comments recommended requiring disclosures for compact fluorescent lamps that would be unique to this type
of lamp. These suggestions are discussed below. 


a. Equivalence claims.

 In its proposal described in the NPR, ACEEE suggested that the relative light output of a compact fluorescent lamp
be measured by comparing it to an incandescent reference lamp, with an incandescent reference lamp being defined
for each common type and wattage of compact fluorescent lamp.

133

 Presumably, this would provide those purchasers who use watts when buying incandescent lamps with light output information
they could use in deciding which compact fluorescent lamp would provide the most comparable replacement for that
incandescent reference lamp. Responding to this suggestion, some comments recommended against requiring that
the lumens of compact fluorescent lamps be expressed as a percentage of the light output of an incandescent reference
lamp.

134

 Others favored such an approach.

MN DPS, GG9, 2 (``It would be confusing to express light output of a lamp as a percent of a reference lamp. Comparison
with reference lamps is an excellent approach, but the comparison should be simply stated in watts, lumens per watt
and lumens. It would be especially helpful in encouraging the sale of compact fluorescent lamps to have a comparable
light output compact fluorescent lamp as the reference lamp for incandescent lamps and vice-versa.''); LRC, GG15,
2; MA AG (Supp.), GG24, 2. 

</FOOTNOTE>


The Commission believes that the disclosure of wattage, light output in lumens, and the other factors required by
the final labeling rules, will be sufficient to allow purchasers to compare competing products when making purchasing
decisions, without the necessity of tying a compact fluorescent lamp to a specific incandescent reference lamp.
Therefore, the Commission has decided not to require disclosure of an equivalent reference lamp for each compact
fluorescent lamp. Manufacturers may voluntarily choose to make equivalence claims, however. 



b. Base-up/base-down measurement. 

Most comments that specifically addressed the light output performance of compact fluorescent lamps suggested
that lumen measurements for these products vary depending on whether the lamp is tested in a base-up or base-down position.

136

 For example, there was testimony at the Workshop to the effect that there could be as much as a 20 to 30 percent variation
in light output between a base-down and a base-up configuration, depending on the lamp and its installation.

137

 The comments also state that no test procedure has yet been developed to measure lumens accurately for compact fluorescent
lamps in a base-down position.

GG22, 2. Compact fluorescent lamps normally are tested for light output ratings with the base facing upward.
On the other hand, compact fluorescent lamps used as replacements for incandescent lamps normally are used with the
base facing downward. This difference in position may result in a different light output. In addition, the temperature
of the environment surrounding the compact fluorescent lamp also affects light output. When compact fluorescent
lamps are used in enclosed luminaires with internal temperatures that are elevated above room temperature, the result
may be reduced light output. The same is true when compact fluorescent lamps are operated outdoors at low temperatures.
