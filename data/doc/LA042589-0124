METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PATROLS ADDED AFTER THREATS TO OFFICIALS 
The Sheriff's Department has ordered special patrols around the homes of 
Lynwood City Council members after a 5-gallon plastic bottle containing rags 
and an unknown liquid was found near the residence of one councilman. 
Councilman Robert Henning, along with a colleague, reported receiving 
threatening calls last week after their vote to rename Century Boulevard in 
honor of slain civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
The Sheriff's Department added extra patrols around the homes of all of the 
council members in the wake of the weekend discovery, said Capt. Stuart 
Hansell, commander of the Lynwood substation.
