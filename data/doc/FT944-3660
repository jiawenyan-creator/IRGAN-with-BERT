FT  12 DEC 94 / Emerging Markets: China's entrance switches to exit - The
Emerging Investor
At one stage on Friday during the Hong Kong stock market's dizzying 3.5 per
cent fall a colleague of Mr Ian McEvatt, chief executive of Indosuez Asset
Management, asked what to do. 'Put on crash helmet and sit in the corner,'
said the garrulous Irishman who has nearly Dollars 3bn under management.
Mr McEvatt's colleague was not the only fund manager reaching for crash
helmets.
Since the beginning of the year when the Hang Seng Index of leading Hong
Kong stocks reached its all time high of 12,201.09 the index has shed more
than 36 per cent of its value, making Hong Kong the worst performing market
this year.
On Friday it closed at its low for the year of 7,789.07.
Six percentage points of this year's decline occured last week as investors,
mainly US and European mutual funds, cut their exposure to Hong Kong stocks.
A combination of fears about higher US interest rates, and concern about
China have made international investors chary of committing too large a
proportion of their portfolio to the colony's bourse.
Amplifying the size of the price change has been the ease with which
investors can reduce their holdings of Hong Kong equity when, as happened
last week, the taste for Asian equity turned sour.
Asset allocators in the US and Europe may take a regional perspective when
investing in Asia's emerging markets. However when it comes to reducing
their exposure to the region, Hong Kong is the market which often bears the
brunt of the selling as it is a deeper and more liquid market than any
other.
Last year the colony was touted as the gateway to China. Recently it has
fulfilled this role in an unintended way. It has become many investors' exit
from China.
Underlying this change in sentiment is the performance of the Hang Seng
China enterprise index, a new index which measures the price performance of
Hong Kong's so-called 'red chips'. It has nearly halved in value this year
from 1,947.43 to 1,002.61 on Friday.
Concerns about the Chinese economy, especially the apparently uncontrollable
rises in inflation, have been with investors for most of this year. What has
changed, however, is the perception of China risk.
'The mood surrounding China has changed from over optimism to greater
reality,' said Mr Danny Truell, head of Hong Kong and China research at SG
Warburg in Hong Kong.
From being 'maximum bullish', investors, especially international investors,
have become moderately concerned.
Lehman Brothers' Dollars 100m law suit against three leading state
companies, problems with the lease of MacDonalds, the fast food chain, in
Beijing, and evidence that commercial banks are becoming wary about lending
to China have all served to undermine investors' belief in the 'China
story'.
But Mr Truell, like others, believes that foreign investors may have
overstated China's problems.
Mr Richard Witts, managing director of United Mok Ying Kie, a local
brokerage, believes that inflation in China next year will fall
significantly from current levels of about 27 per cent.
The factors which boosted prices this year, such as grain price deregulation
and changes to China's exchange rate regime, were 'one off' and would not
affect prices in 1995.
What concerns most analysts in Hong Kong is interest rates.
The colony's rates follow those set by the US Federal Reserve because of the
Hong Kong dollar's fixed link to the dollar. As the Fed has tightened
policy, investors in Hong Kong have seen a turnround from sharply negative
real rates at the beginning of the year to mildly positive real interest
rates today.
Most analysts believe that share prices do not have much chance of advancing
until the top of the current interest rate cycle becomes apparent, and that
may not be until the second quarter of next year.
In the meantime analysts are attempting to assess the impact on corporate
earnings of the change in the interest rate environment.
Mr Truell believes that Hong Kong's stock market has become much more
sensitive to interest rates over recent years. He estimates that 64 per cent
of the market's earnings will derive from property and banking in 1995,
compared with 51 per cent in 1991. Banks and property companies perform
better when interest rates are falling rather than rising.
Over the course of the past three months earnings forecasts have been
trimmed. In the summer analysts were looking forward to 1995 earnings growth
of 16 to 18 per cent. That was cut in November to 14 to 16 per cent. Some
analysts have reduced their forecasts further in recent weeks to 10 to 13
per cent.
With earnings expected to grow next year by this latter amount the Hong Kong
market is trading on a prospective p/e ratio of 9.5 to 10. This is toward
the bottom of the market's historic trading range, leading many to believe
that the market may not have that much further to fall before it begins to
improve.
Ms Janice Wallace, head of equity research at Goldman Sachs Asia and a
consistent bear of the Hong Kong market for most of 1994, believes that the
market may be due for a correction. 'Perhaps we have overdone things on the
way down,' she said.
She is forecasting the Hang Seng at 9,500 for the end of 1995 - a 20 per
cent gain from current levels. 'But I expect most of it in the second half
of 1995,' she said, adding that further rises in US interest rates would
depress prices in the first half.
For perennial bulls such as Mr Witts the conclusion to draw from last week's
stock market rout is obvious: 'I think we are in deep buying territory,' he
said.
