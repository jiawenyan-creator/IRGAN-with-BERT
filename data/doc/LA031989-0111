TRADITION SAYS HAM FOR EASTER; 
TANGY RHUBARB SAUCE CAN ADD TO HOLIDAY DINNER ENJOYMENT 
Traditional Easter feasts often center around a tender, juicy ham. Most hams 
today are fully cooked and available as either boneless or bone-in. Convenience 
in carving makes the boneless variety especially popular. 
A boneless fully cooked ham provides four to five (three-ounce) servings per 
pound. To serve hot, heat 18 to 25 minutes per pound, or to an internal 
temperature of 130 to 140 degrees. For an extra-special touch, serve with tangy 
Rhubarb Sauce. 
HAM WITH RHUBARB SAUCE 
1 (3- to 4-pound) boneless fully cooked ham half 
1 (1-pound) package frozen cut rhubarb, thawed 
1 1/4 cups sugar 
1/3 cup orange juice 
2 teaspoons grated orange peel 
3/4 teaspoon dry mustard 
1 cinnamon stick 
Place ham on rack in open roasting pan. Insert meat thermometer so bulb is 
centered in thickest part. Roast at 325 degrees 18 to 25 minutes per pound or 
until thermometer registers 130 to 140 degrees. 
Meanwhile, combine rhubarb, sugar, orange juice, orange peel, mustard and 
cinnamon stick in large saucepan. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and 
cook, uncovered, 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove cinnamon stick. 
Spoon small amount sauce over ham 15 minutes before end of cooking time. Serve
