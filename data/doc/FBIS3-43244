  [Text] Cape Town Dec 31 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] in the Western Cape on Friday condemned the "senseless 
attack on innocent people" at the Heidelberg tavern in 
Observatory shortly before midnight. 
  IFP Western Cape Chairman Alan Gibson and Vice-Chairman 
Lesley Langenhoven said they were "horrified" to hear of the 
attack in which four people lost their lives and others were 
wounded a few minutes before midnight. 
  They "implored" the people of Cape Town to assist the police 
in bringing "these murderers to justice". "We also ask those 
leaders of liberation movements to show respect for the victims 
by praying for them at home and not to use this incident for 
political gain while your members still retain their AK47's and 
limpet mines," they said. 
  Inkatha challenged liberation movements to hand in their 
"weapons of destruction now" and singled out the ANC [African 
National Congress] as being the most heavily armed group in the 
Western Cape region.
