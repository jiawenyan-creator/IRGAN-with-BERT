PERES CLAIMS ENOUGH VOTES TO FORM NEW ISRAELI GOVERNMENT 
Labor Party leader Shimon Peres announced today that he has enough votes to 
form a government and that he has requested a special Parliament session to 
approve the new coalition. 
Peres notified President Chaim Herzog that he has succeeded in getting majority 
backing in the 120-member Parliament, known as the Knesset, to replace the 
coalition that collapsed March 15. 
Before the announcement, observers believed Peres had only 60 assured votes. 
Israel army radio said a defector from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's 
right-wing Likud bloc has signed an agreement with Labor. It identified the 
legislator as Avraham Sharir, a former tourism minister. Labor officials have 
refused comment on the reports. 
With a Parliament vote not likely until Sunday, Likud has time to try to lure 
Sharir and other potential Labor coalition partners back into its fold.
