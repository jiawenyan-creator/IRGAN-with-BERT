MAJOR COST OVERRUNS AT HUGHES AIRCRAFT 
Airborne Optical Adjunct Sensor. An electronic telescope for the "Star Wars" 
project, the sensor is designed to detect and track ballistic missiles at long 
ranges. It is supposed to provide a thousandfold increase in data-processing 
capability over previous optical surveillance systems. 
OVERRUN: $132 million, borne by the government. 
Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). The Air Force's newest 
generation radar-guided missile represents a marked improvement over older 
missiles. Hughes experienced the overrun during a delay in development of the 
missile. 
OVERRUN: $250 million, borne by Hughes. 
Joint Tactical Information Distribution System. This sophisticated voice and 
data radio system was to have linked different aircraft and ships. The project 
was unsuccessful and canceled by the Navy in 1985. 
NONPERFORMANCE PENALTY: estimated $200 million. 
Command Control Intelligence System. Still under development, the program is 
being conducted for the government of Norway. The system is an elaborate data 
and voice control system, primarily for air defense. 
OVERRUN: $120 million, borne by Hughes. 
Ku Band Radar and Communications System. This was a space radar and 
communications system developed for the space shuttle. Hughes eventually built 
four of the units at a cost of more than $160 million. 
OVERRUN: $94 million, borne by NASA. 
Air Defense System for Egypt. This is another of the firm's integrated radar 
and air defense communications systems. Little is known about the program. 
OVERRUN: Reported to be $56 million and growing. RALPH VARTABEDIAN
