OUTTAKES: CALMER SEAS AHEAD? 
When "The Love Boat: A Valentine Voyage" sets sail on CBS Monday night at 9, 
Lauren Tewes won't be aboard with her many former co-stars. Tewes, who played 
cruise director Julie McCoy on the hit series -- a lucrative role derailed, in 
part, by her admitted cocaine addiction -- says she was offered only a small 
cameo on the reunion show. 
She turned it down. 
"I've done that," says Tewes, who says she's now drug free. "I didn't want to 
go back to such a small part. It really didn't interest me." 
(Fred Grandy, now a Republican congressman from Iowa, is the only other 
original cast member missing from "A Valentine Voyage.") 
In 1985, Tewes confessed her drug problem to TV Guide. There were also reports 
of a salary dispute. "Love Boat" co-exec producers Aaron Spelling and Douglas 
Cramer let her contract run out. Neither producer wished to comment on Tewes' 
history. 
Although her acting career never fully recovered, she's been getting work, 
including a small role in the recent USA Network suspense-drama "The China Lake 
Murders." Married to musician Paolo Nonnis, Tewes has also been active in local 
theater -- currently directing "The Head" at the Matrix Theatre. 
"I hope and pray that that's all past now," Tewes says of her troubles. "I 
think I made the right choices by trying to stay in the business while it was 
trying to keep me out, by following my own heart and my own drive, and by 
making the choice to stick it through." Mary Helen Berg
