FT  18 OCT 94 / Scottish water costs 'to double'
Plans by the Scottish Office to involve the private sector in financing
water and sewerage projects will cost businesses and council-tax payers
double what they would pay if they were financed by local councils, says
Scotland's biggest local authority.
Strathclyde regional council yesterday presented calculations showing the
cost to payers of business rates and council tax of a private contractor
building a sewage treatment plant and financing it via the build, own and
operate method. It compared this with its cost of it building the same
installation and borrow from the government's low-interest Loans Fund.
The Scottish Office wants to see 15 water and sewerage projects worth a
total of Pounds 545m financed under the build, own and operate method in the
next few years.
Strathclyde says an Pounds 80m installation financed from the Loans Fund
would have a capital cost over 27 years of Pounds 167m including interest,
and operating costs of Pounds 115m, making Pounds 282m in all. If the same
installation were built under build, own and operate, payers of council tax
and sewerage rates would pay for it according to throughput. Assuming an
average charge in full operation of 20p per cubic metre, the cost to the
public over 27 years would be Pounds 453m.
