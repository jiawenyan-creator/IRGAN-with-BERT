S. KOREAN AIRLINE BUYS UP TO 4 BOEING 747-400S 
Asiana Airlines of Seoul, South Korea, has ordered two Boeing 747-400s and 
placed options on two more, the Boeing Co. announced. 
Neither Boeing nor Asiana issued the exact cost of the deal, although Boeing 
said the two firm orders are worth more than $285 million. 
The price range for a 747-400 runs $116 million to $136 million, but Boeing 
spokesman Randy Harrison said the order also includes spare parts and other 
equipment.
