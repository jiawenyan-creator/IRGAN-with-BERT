FT  20 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Alarming view of past events
Sir, In his article 'Return to the Family' (January 14) Simon Holberton
quotes Mr Tsang, chairman of a 'pro-Beijing' grouping within Hong Kong,
describing his first visit to China, an event that took place in 1965. 'It
was love at first sight. I talked to older people and to younger ones like
me. They were all inspired by some higher goals that were simply lacking in
Hong Kong.'
It is perhaps worth recalling that 1966 saw the beginning of the cultural
revolution. People may well have been inspired by Mao's contrived
fanaticism, but the most visible 'higher goals' were the persecution and
slaughter of imaginary 'class enemies'.
Mr Tsang's enthusiastic response might, perhaps, have been understandable in
an over-excited 19-year-old. The fact that, nearly 30 years later, he can,
without apparent remorse, recall and by implication even endorse those
feelings is repellent. Given that Mr Tsang may presumably achieve some power
in post-1997 Hong Kong, it is also highly alarming, at least for those who
may be unfortunate enough to live under him.
