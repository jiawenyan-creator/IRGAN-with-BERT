FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: JC Penney in communications
joint venture
J. C. PENNEY, the fourth biggest US retailer, yesterday said it expected to
form a joint venture with GTE Spacenet and Capital Cities/ABC to provide a
wide range of communications services to retailers.
The announcement comes only a day after Sears and IBM said they were merging
their voice-and-data networking businesses into a new service company.
The J. C. Penney venture, Advanced Retail Communi-cations, is expected to
start operating in 1993. It will deliver television, audio and data services
to shopping malls and other retail locations using a combination of digital
satellite broadcasting and earth-based transmission networks.
