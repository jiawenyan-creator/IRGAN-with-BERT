VIETNAM READY FOR BUSINESS 
In response to articles on Vietnam seeking to rejoin the international economy 
(front page, Dec. 23-24): 
Your article "Getting Back to Business in Vietnam" was an excellent coverage 
for "business" purposes. It did not, however, address the reason for the trade 
embargo with the welfare of the Vietnamese people in mind. 
Due to loss of life suffered by the boat people who did not make it in addition 
to the cost of hard cash that the United States and other benevolent nations 
are contributing to care for those who made it, no profit from any business 
could be justified as long as Vietnam is still dotted with concentration camps 
and the people still risk their lives trying to escape. 
At a time when communism is collapsing or already collapsed in many countries, 
the Vietnamese people would be betrayed by any attempt to shore up the shaky 
Communist regime in Hanoi. 
There is enough proof as unveiled recently that socialism, Marxist-style, does 
not benefit the people but just a small group of party members practicing 
totalitarian dictatorship. 
The American ideal of freedom and pursuit of happiness should not be further 
strained by greed and the chase for a fast buck. There is plenty of business in 
the United States for the taker. A few more years of patient pressure will 
result in a Vietnam with freedom and democracy where people will take a boat 
out for fishing and not for escaping.
