FT  14 MAY 91 / Letter: The enterprise culture in Paraguay
Sir, It is so seldom that Paraguay gets press coverage in Britain, that it
is disappointing that your correspondent Christina Lamb gives your readers a
rather distorted view of my country in her article, 'Paraguay finds old
habits die hard', (May 9).
Street vendors do hawk French perfumes and Japanese electronics, but should
one presume they are contraband? Smuggling had been endemic during the
Stroessner regime, and one of the first measures of the new government of
president Rodriguez was to cut the tariffs on these and most other consumer
luxuries to 7 per cent - removing the incentive to smuggle, and practically
ending the illegal import of these goods.
The high tariff barriers of our neighbours do, naturally, make shopping in
Paraguay very attractive, generating an important regional tourist trade.
This has helped to sustain our growth rate in spite of the major adjustments
that have had to be made as state subsidies and other forms of government
intervention are removed from the economy.
In fact, the World Bank estimates our gross domestic product growth for 1990
at 5.1 per cent, not the zero growth stated in your article.
Of course the after-effects of 35 years of autocratic rule cannot be wished
away, and the struggle to perfect our democratic institutions, our human
rights record and the liberal-isation of the economy continues. Gigantic
strides in this direction have already been made, and we shall persist.
My government remains as committed as ever to supporting the creative forces
of free enterprise in a truly democratic environment.
