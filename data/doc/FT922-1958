FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: Unichips acquires Spanish crisps
group from Borden
UNICHIPS, the privately-owned Italian company which is the country's biggest
maker of potato crisps, is expanding further in Europe with the purchase of
Crecspan, Spain's second-biggest crisps group.
The vendor is Borden, the US multinational which bought Barcelona-based
Crecspan in 1984. No price for the deal, in which Rothschild Italia advised
the purchaser, was revealed.
Unichips, controlled by Mr Alberto Vitaloni, the son of the founder, is best
known in Italy for its San Carlo brand, which has around 50 per cent of the
domestic potato crisps market. The company started operating in Spain in
1989, and the following year bought control of Flodor in France, where it is
also the market leader.
With its latest acquisition, made for cash, Unichips will have sales of
around L750bn (Dollars 628.1m) this year.
