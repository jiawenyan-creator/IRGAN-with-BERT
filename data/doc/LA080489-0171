NCAA COUNCIL FAILS TO DECIDE MILLS ELIGIBILITY 
The NCAA Council has informed the University of Arizona that it has not reached 
a decision regarding the eligibility of Chris Mills, who transferred from 
Kentucky, the school said today. 
The council, meeting in San Diego, told the university that it is referring the 
matter to the infractions committee for review later this month. 
Arizona officials sent the NCAA an appeal in late July asking that Mills, a 
6-foot-7 swing man from Fairfax High in Los Angeles, be declared eligible for 
the 1989-90 season. 
Mills, the center figure during the NCAA's investigation of Kentucky, was 
declared ineligible at Kentucky earlier this summer after the NCAA levied 
sanctions against the Kentucky program. 
The NCAA alleged that former Kentucky assistant coach Dwane Casey sent $1,000 
by courier to Mills' father, Claud, during the recruitment of Mills.
