SHORT TAKES; 
NBC'S 'COSBY SHOW' STILL NO. 1; 'SMALL SACRIFICES' CLOSE SECOND 
NBC's "The Cosby Show" was first again but the ABC miniseries "Small 
Sacrifices" ran a close second in the Nielsen ratings for the week ended Nov. 
19. 
Bill Cosby was at the top for the third straight week and five other NBC 
comedies were in the Top 10. 
"Small Sacrifices," starring Farrah Fawcett as an Oregon woman convicted of 
shooting her children so that she could be with her boyfriend, was next with 
the last of two parts. The first part was 12th in the previous week's ratings. 
NBC won the week by a wide margin. Its average in the A. C. Nielsen Co. survey 
was 16.0. ABC was second with 13.2 and CBS was third with 11.7. The rating is 
the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million television homes tuned in to a 
program.
