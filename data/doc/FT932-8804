FT  17 MAY 93 / International Company News: Swiss Bank Corp to cut 200 jobsS
SWISS Bank Corporation will reorganise its North American operations and cut
200 jobs this year, AP-DJ reports from Zurich.
The bank said the objective was to create a powerful capital markets and
treasury and corporate finance franchise, complemented by a funds management
and private banking strategy.
While it was eliminating existing duplication, the bank said it expected a
'substantial potential for head-count expansion in the years to come'.
SBC has combined its former corporate and merchant banking units to form a
single North American merchant banking group. It is integrating its support
and staff functions to create single units across business lines wherever
possible.
It will concentrate its West Coast client coverage in its San Francisco
office and close its Houston office by the end of the third quarter.
The bank said the realignment was driven by its continued strategy to build
an integrated merchant and investment bank.
Areas most affected by the job reductions were merchant banking, support,
logistic and staff units, the bank said.
In the merchant banking group, SBC aims to strengthen its position in credit
portfolio management and 'to focus on obtaining advisory based mandates in
the US, Canada and Latin America.'
