  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 4 (CNA) -- Two-way trade between 
Taiwan and Mainland China will continue to grow this year, but 
at a slower pace than before, the Ministry of Economic Affairs 
said Tuesday [4 January]. 
  The ministry predicted that indirect trade across the Taiwan 
strait will reach U.S.$20 billion in 1994, up from 1993's 
estimated U.S.$15 billion. It noted that imports from the 
mainland should increase this year, but mainland-bound shipments 
may not grow as fast as last year. 
  Taiwan exports to the mainland grew by 42 percent in 1991, 
and by only 34 percent in 1992. In the first nine months of 
1993, the rate dropped to 25 percent. 
  Imports from the mainland jumped 47 percent in 1991 from the 
year-earlier level, but declined 0.6 percent in 1992. Mainland 
imports dropped 3 percent in the first nine months of 1993 
compared with the same period of the previous year. 
  Ministry officials said imports from the mainland are 
expected to increase this year because the government has 
further eased import restrictions and mainland goods have become 
more competitive following the recent depreciation of the 
mainland currency against the U.S. dollar. 
  The officials also expected Taiwan's reliance on the 
mainland 
market to climb in coming years. Cross-strait trade accounted 
for 4.16 percent of Taiwan's total foreign trade in 1991. The 
percentage rose to 4.83 percent in 1992 and surged to an 
all-time high of 5.28 percent in the January-September period of 
1993. 
  In terms of exports, Taiwan has become even more reliant on 
the mainland, the officials warned. In 1987, exports to the 
mainland made up a mere 2.29 percent of Taiwan's total outbound 
shipments, but the share rose to 8.83 percent in the first nine 
months of last year. 
  Meanwhile, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Taiwan 
residents remitted U.S.$187.73 million to the mainland through 
local banks in the first 10 months of 1993, an average of 
U.S.$352,000 a day. Because the government still bans direct 
cross-strait financial exchanges, the money was remitted mostly 
via Hong Kong or other areas. 
  A total of U.S.$493.13 million in Taiwan money was 
indirectly 
remitted to the mainland between May 1990 and October 1993. The 
figure did not include money brought to the mainland by Taiwan 
residents personally.
