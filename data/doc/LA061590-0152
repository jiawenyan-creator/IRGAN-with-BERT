BRIEFLY 
S&amp;P Downgrades Ford, Chrysler: Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Group 
downgraded its credit ranking for Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., signaling 
sagging faith in the auto industry's finances. 
Moody's Investor Services Inc. said it is considering whether to change 
Chrysler's rating. The ratings reflect how Wall Street views companies' credit 
worthiness. Lower ratings generally mean that firms must pay higher interest to 
borrow in the credit markets. S&amp;P dropped Ford one notch to AA-minus from 
AA, considered a high level of investment grade securities. Chrysler fell to 
S&amp;P's lowest investment-grade, BBB-minus from BBB.
