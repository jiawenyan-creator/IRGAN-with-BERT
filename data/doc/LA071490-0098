CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SACRAMENTO; 
FEW DRUG-EXPOSED BABIES RECEIVE HELP 
More than 72,000 babies are born in California each year with prenatal exposure 
to harmful drugs and alcohol, but only about 11% of them are in county 
programs, state researchers announced. The Senate Office of Research said 25 of 
the state's 58 counties reported that 6,358 drug-exposed newborns were referred 
to county child welfare services in the 1988-89 fiscal year. 
The counties account for 80% of the state's births. Only 11% of the estimated 
72,000 babies who were exposed to drugs in the womb are being referred to Child 
Protective Services units, the report found. Ninety-one percent of the counties 
responding to the survey said cocaine was the drug detected most often in 
screening tests of high-risk mothers or babies. "Counties are reporting an 
alarming lack of drug treatment programs for substance-abusing pregnant women 
and new mothers, posing untold risks for thousands of babies," said Sen. Diane 
Watson, the Los Angeles Democrat who requested the survey.
