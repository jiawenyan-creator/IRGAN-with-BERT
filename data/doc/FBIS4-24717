  [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), 
met here today with Peter Chiu, managing director of the Hong 
Kong Health Food Enterprise Company, and his wife Cheung Yeuk 
Lee. 
  Chiu and his wife made the trip to donate six million yuan 
to 
build 100 primary schools in poor regions on the mainland. 
  Li spoke highly of the action and said that people around 
the 
country were paying great attention to education, one of the 
most important and outstanding problems in China now. 
  In recent years, Li said, many patriotic overseas Chinese 
and 
compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao have donated large amounts of 
money to help build schools in poor areas. The donors should be 
praised, he added. 
  He also expressed his hope that relevant departments on the 
mainland cooperate closely with donors and apply their donations 
to yield effective results. For instance, with support of the 
United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party 
Central Committee, Taiwan entrepreneur Kander Lee's donation has 
achieved real results in development of education, he said. 
  The 100 schools underwritten by the couple, under 
arrangements by the United Front Work Department of the Chinese 
Communist Party Central Committee, are expected to be finished 
by the end of 1995. 
  Part of the donation will be used to construct "Chunlei 
Primary Schools", sponsored by the All-China Women's Federation 
exclusively for girl dropouts.
