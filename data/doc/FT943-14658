FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Alcan posts profit after three
years of losses
Alcan Aluminium of Canada yesterday reported its first quarterly net profit
since late 1991.
Net profit for the second quarter was USDollars 7m, or 1 cent a share after
preferred dividends, against a loss of Dollars 35m, or 18 cents a share, a
year earlier.
Revenues were Dollars 2.07bn, up 11 per cent from a year earlier because of
higher volumes in fabricated products and higher ingot prices and shipments.
Canadian operations improved and the US posted a small profit with higher
can sheet sales. Latin America also made a small profit as it benefited from
the improved fabricated products business in Brazil.
Europe continued to strengthen, with better results from fabricated products
and alumina operations. Australia also recorded further improvement.
First-half revenues were up 7 per cent to Dollars 3.88bn, and the net loss
was Dollars 18m, or 12 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 55m, or 29
cents a share.
Mr Jacques Bougie, president, said Alcan continued to be cautious for the
near term. The company was reaping benefits from its cost-reduction
programme, but prices for fabricated products were only beginning to reflect
recent gains in ingot.
He added that the large proportion of Alcan's fabricated product sales were
set on an annual basis, so the price improvement would be seen later this
year and early in 1995.
Total shipment of ingot and fabricated products were 1,386,000 tonnes in the
first half, against 1,218,000 tonnes last time. Fabricated volumes hit a
peak in the second quarter.
Alcan is selling off its remaining building products plants in North
America, for a price estimated by analysts to be more than Dollars 100m, and
will concentrate on its basic smelting and fabricating operations worldwide.
