FT  09 DEC 92 / Torture rife in Chinese jails, claims Amnesty
BRUTAL and sometimes fatal torture has become endemic in Chinese jails in
the past 10 years, although the country's law forbids it and China has
ratified the UN convention against it, Amnesty International reports today.
Amnesty says continued campaigns to crush crime and political opposition
have fuelled human rights violations, including arbitrary detention,
executions and torture. Its report details dozens of cases, some involving
women and children, beaten, shackled for months on end, given electric
shocks, and kept in dark cells too small to stand up or lie down in.
Amnesty says: 'We believe the law enforcement and justice system in China
actually foster torture'. Prisoners have few rights. Many are abused into
confessions. Amnesty accuses China of failing to provide basic safeguards to
protect prisoners. Many are held with no right of access to lawyers, and at
the mercy of police and guards.
China says it follows up cases of torture. A British human rights delegation
was told last week that 400 cases of torture were investigated in 1991,
leading to penalties against the torturers. Amnesty cites the same figure,
which it believes represents only a fraction of the real number of cases. It
urges China to protect prisoners and end the impunity many prison guards
enjoy.
