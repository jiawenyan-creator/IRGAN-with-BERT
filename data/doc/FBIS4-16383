BFN 

  [Text] A five-kilometer zone with a special entry regime 
will pass along the Russian-Chinese border on the territory of 
the Jewish autonomous region along the Russian bank of the Amur 
River. 
  From now on economic, and other activities in the border 
zone 
will be done only with the consent of border-guard troops. The 
entry and exit of the zone will only be allowed when residence 
permits are shown. Residents of other territories will have to 
get special documents permitting their entry. Foreigners are to 
be registered at local police stations. 
  The toughened measures are linked with frequent cases of 
border violations and the deterioration of the criminal 
situation in the border zone.
