SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Howard University has been conducting research for a number of years to develop genetic engineering techniques to
enhance the capability of fungi/bacteria to degrade lignocellulose to simpler materials. Successful completion
of this research would advance the goal of converting biomass to useful chemicals and other products. A detailed understanding
of the processes that control the reactivity and specificity of enzymatic reactions within the fungi/bacteria will
provide the knowledge needed to exploit these reactions for technological applications. 





DOE has performed a review in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7 and has determined that the activity to be funded is necessary
to satisfactorily complete the current research. DOE funding for this grant is estimated at $150,000 and the anticipated
period of performance is twelve (12) months.
