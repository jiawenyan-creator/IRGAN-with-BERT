FT  26 OCT 94 / Steel back in the melting pot: The collapse of the EU rescue
plan for the industry
Critics of the European Commission's two-year attempt to forge a rescue plan
for the European Union's steel industry had their chance to say 'I told you
so' yesterday.
Since 1992, the Commission has tried to persuade private and public sector
steelmakers to restructure and close down excess capacity.
But yesterday, the plan's two chief architects, Mr Karel Van Miert,
competition commissioner, and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner,
finally recognised that the plan was dead and proposed abandoning it.
The Commission has succeeded in preventing a free-for-all on state aid to
ailing steelmakers and in achieving some capacity reduction. But it has
fallen well short of the minimum 19m tonne target that most observers
believe is necessary to avoid overcapacity when the industry next moves into
a downturn, a problem that has plagued the industry over the past 20 years.
The EU's big steelmakers first approached the Commission two years ago for
help in tackling the problems of recession, including competition from cheap
east European imports and their own manufacturing overcapacity.
Losses in the industry were piling up with some of the best-known
steelmakers - such as Krupp and Thyssen of Germany and Ilva of Italy - in
deep financial trouble.
A previous attempt by Brussels to organise the steel market in the early
1980s had involved direct intervention in the steel market. The so-called
Davignon plan, named after Mr Etienne Davignon, then industry commissioner,
allowed the Commission to dictate individual companies' production quotas,
impose protectionist trade measures, and endorse subsidies and price
cartels.
This time, Mr Van Miert and Mr Bangemann adopted a different approach. The
Commission offered market supervision through quarterly guidance on
production and delivery volumes to encourage reduction in capacity. It
encouraged privatisation of publicly owned steelmakers to reduce capacity.
The plan also involved approval of industry levies to finance closures;
limited protection from cheap imports; and Ecu240m of social aid to
redundant steelworkers.
In the winter of 1992, Mr Fernand Braun, the Commission's special steel
envoy, elicited promises of 'potential' and 'probable' cuts in capacity of
about 17m tonnes in crude steel and some 11m tonnes in rolled products
during a series of negotiations with steel companies.
Yet it was clear from the outset that private steel companies were reluctant
to make real capacity cuts. State-owned steelmakers were also reluctant to
reduce capacity, and continued to lobby for state aid with the backing of
national governments or powerful regional lobbies.
'Too many steelmakers thought their competitors were more likely to go
under, or that it made more sense to wait for an upturn in prices,' says one
official.
The first significant blow to the rescue plan occurred last year when a
powerful local campaign prevented the closure of the loss-making Klockner
works near Bremen in Germany. Closing Klockner would have given an early
push toward the 19m tonne target; instead its survival encouraged others to
resist.
A second blow came last June when Mr Van Miert unexpectedly lost a battle in
the Commission over steel closures in the Bresciani region of northern
Italy. He wanted approval for Ecu415m of aid to help eliminate an estimated
5m tonnes in capacity.
When this was denied, Mr Van Miert promptly declared the steel plan 'dead'.
Weeks later, the full Commission approved a new version of the plan which
showed that the state aid to the Bresciani did not, in fact, violate EU
rules.
The Bresciani deal brought the cuts being pledged or carried out to about
15.5m of capacity and seemed to revive the rescue plan. But with steel
prices steadily improving, further capacity cuts could not be made as steel
companies found demand rising.
Messrs Van Miert and Bangemann tried another round of expensive dinners and
loud table-banging to persuade the steelmakers to find more cuts, with no
success.
'We just knew we were never going to get the extra capacity cuts,' said one
official, 'so we could no longer in good faith continue with the plan.'
Critics of the rescue plan have long feared that steelmakers would use a
short-term increase in demand to avoid or postpone painful decisions on
capacity cuts. Now, with the recession over, their fears have been
vindicated.
Late last month, German steelmakers said they were prepared to forgo the
Brussels aid package and wait for the next recession before trying once
again to agree on cuts.
The collapse comes as no surprise to industry analysts. Mr Rod Beddows of
Beddows &amp; Co, a steel consultancy, says overcapacity is not spread evenly
across the EU steel industry. The German industry, for example, is already
working at full capacity producing flat products, although the economic
recovery has yet to reach full swing.
More seriously, he questions the approach of trying to reduce overcapacity
as a solution to the industry's ills. Overcapacity, Mr Beddows believes, is
only a symptom of the real problem, state intervention via subsidies that
prop up uneconomic steelmakers.
'The Commission's plan was a non-solution to a non-problem,' he says. 'Until
the notion of state intervention in all its forms is removed, you won't get
a healthy industry.'
With the ending of the Commission's rescue plan, two issues remain
unresolved. First, there is concern that further painful attempts to cut
capacity will have to be made when the industry enters its next downturn, as
the task remains unfinished.
Second, non-subsidised producers continue to worry about subsidies to
loss-making competitors that threaten their own profitability. 'Subsidies
are still supporting capacity, and that nettle has to be grasped,' says
British Steel, one of the most profitable non-aided producers.
Even with the market picking up, some steelmakers continue to demand
subsidies. This week, Germany's economics ministry and the Treuhand
privatisation agency asked the Commission to back a rescue package for Eko
Stahl, the east German producer, worth DM890m (Pounds 365m).
Subsidies could re-emerge as a serious problem when the steel market begins
to fall again, with member countries coming under further pressure to
support loss-making producers.
However, the industry has learnt some vital lessons about how to survive in
a recession that might make the problems less serious in the future. These
include the need to be flexible as demand fluctuates.
'The decisive thing that we have learnt is to reduce the level of raw steel
production - to shut blast furnaces which in the past kept producing, no
matter what happened - and to base all our calculations on those reduced
levels,' says one German producer.
The steel companies are also learning to seek market solutions rather than
wait for Brussels to sort out the problems. Innovative transnational
alliances, reciprocal equity stakes and investments are beginning to create
a less nationally-based industry. That raises the prospect, albeit not
immediately, of an industry that can prosper without subsidies.
