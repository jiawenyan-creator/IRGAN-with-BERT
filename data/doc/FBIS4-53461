  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Parliamentary vice ministers 
called unanimously Thursday [19 May] for further restructuring 
and cost-cutting efforts by the government, a government 
spokesman said. 
  The vice ministers said in their meeting that the government 
should share the pain with the private sector, Deputy Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Naoto Kitamura told a press conference. They 
were apparently endorsing a government decision Wednesday to 
suspend planned hikes in public service charges. 
  The government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata announced 
Wednesday it will suspend until the end of the year planned 
increases in public service charges, including highway tolls, 
telephone rates and public transportation fares. Kitamura said 
the vice ministers praised Hata's decision as "wise." 
  The spokesman said they agreed to ask their ministries to 
make further cost-cutting efforts, including scrapping and 
integration of government organs, a cut in personnel costs and 
streamlining of government-affiliated bodies. 
  Meanwhile, government sources said local bus services may be 
excluded from the planned rate freeze. Suspension of a 
requested fare hike of 10 percent could cause bankruptcy for 
some local bus companies, the sources said.
