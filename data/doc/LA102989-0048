CHILD'S PLAY: AROUND HOME; 
A TOUR OF NBC STUDIOS 
THE NBC STUDIO Tour is designed to demonstrate how a television program is 
created and how a show is broadcast. NBC has outfitted a mini-studio 
specifically for the tour and equipped it with a simulated control booth so 
that visitors have a chance to see themselves on television. Depending on the 
highly variable demand for studio space and taping schedules, the tour also 
stops at the wardrobe, set storage and prop departments, and possibly "The 
Tonight Show" set, KNBC News studio and the Skypath satellite broadcast system. 
The tour concludes at the Sound and Special Effects Center, where TV's great 
mysteries -- such as how faces change color and where all those weird noises 
come from -- are explained. 
Children are welcome on these regular tours, but NBC has designated November 
and May as Youth Months, with special children's tours oriented to the 
interests and comprehension level of elementary school students. The Youth 
Month tours visit the same locations as the regular tour, but guides tailor 
their descriptions to first- through sixth-graders. Each tour makes its own 
simulated TV production, with heroes, heroines, villains and production 
personnel recruited from members of the tour group. 
 Advance reservations are not required for groups of fewer than 20. The price, 
$6.50 for adults and $4.50 for children, includes peacock jacket patch during 
the month of November. There is no minimum group size for the tour, but 
children cannot take the tour unescorted. Picnic areas are available in Buena 
Vista Park, across from the studios. NBC Studios is located at 3000 W. Alameda 
Ave., Burbank; for information, telephone (818) 840-3537.
