FT  12 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME sustains turnover growth
for seventh year in succession
The London Metal Exchange, the world's largest terminal market for physical
metal, continued its turnover growth for the seventh successive year in
1993. And its financial strength enabled the exchange to refund Pounds 2m of
the contract levy money paid by clearing members.
Mr David King, chief executive, pointed out that turnover on the LME had
grown five-fold in the past six years, 'reflecting the growing confidence of
the metals industry in the exchange as a genuine hedging medium for their
activities.'
In volume terms the LME's futures and options turnover last year increased
by nearly 43 per cent, from 24.74m lots to 35.29m ('lots' are 25 tonnes for
metals other than aluminium alloy, where each lot is 20 tonnes, nickel, six
tonnes, and tin, five tonnes).
Mr King estimated that turnover increased to Dollars 1,000bn from Dollars
700bn in 1992. He said LME brokers probably had 'a comfortable 1993' but
their margins and commissions represented only 'a sliver' of the turnover.
Commission incomes are based on the gross value of contracts so brokers
suffered when metals prices were low, as was the case last year.
On prospects for 1994, Mr King said: 'The accountant in me says we must look
for a year of consolidation' - more or less the same comment he has made at
the begining of each of the past four years.
Copper's futures turnover showed the biggest gain last year, more than
doubling from 7.3m to 14.9m lots. Turnover in aluminium was up from 8.23m to
10m lots, aluminium alloy, the newest contract, from 7,343 to 111,450 lots,
lead from 976,000 to 1.02m lots, nickel from 1.44m to 2.12m lots, tin from
525,244 to 613,952 lots and zinc from 4m to 4.17m lots. Option turnover rose
by 5.2 per cent from 2.2m to 2.3m lots.
The London Commodity Exchange, which trades chiefly in agricultural futures,
last week reported 'a healthy increase' of 26 per cent in its turnover for
1993 to 3.59m futures and options lots.
The biggest futures gain was cocoa's 33.52 per cent, while options turnover
on that contract more than doubled. Coffee futures trade was up only 5.82
per cent but coffee options business leapt 152 per cent.
