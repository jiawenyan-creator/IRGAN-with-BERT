  [Text] Moscow May 30 TASS -- In keeping with the provisions 
of the Moscow declaration signed by the presidents of Russia and 
the United States on January 14, 1994 and the joint statement by 
the Russian president and the British prime minister of February 
15, 1994, the leaders of the three countries have adopted a 
decision to issue the necessary orders to make sure that by May 
30, 1994 their strategic nuclear missiles are not aimed against 
each other. 
  A statement released by the Russian Foreign Ministry on 
Monday said that Russia has already complied with this agreement 
and day- to-day control of the Russian nuclear forces is carried 
out on the basis of the understanding that the U.S. and Britain 
are not Russia's enemies. 
  The move is expected to strengthen international security 
and 
corresponds the new relations of strategic partnership between 
the three countries and their practical cooperation in the 
military and political sphere, the statement said. 
  The Russian side is also guided by the desire to create a 
more favourable climate for the process of nuclear disarmament 
to involve the whole world and promote the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime and total ban on nuclear testing. 
  Russia proceeds from the understanding that this important 
measure will open up the way for further bilateral and 
multilateral steps to promote mutual trust, stability and 
predictability of strategic nuclear forces, the statement said. 
It expressed the hope that other nuclear countries will follow 
suit.
