FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Slow sales growth hits AST
Research shares
Shares in AST Research, the fifth largest US manufacturer of personal
computers, dropped sharply yesterday when the company confirmed Wall Street
concerns about slower than expected sales growth in the current quarter. AST
shares lost Dollars 5 1/4 to close at Dollars 23 1/2 yesterday, following a
9 per cent drop on Tuesday.
AST is one of the fastest growing companies in the PC industry. For the
fiscal year ended July 3 1993, it lost Dollars 1.72 a share, or Dollars
53.8m, on sales of Dollars 1.41bn. The loss reflected a Dollars 125m pre tax
restructuring charge related to the company's acquisition of Tandy's PC
manufacturing operations in July 1993.
For the first half of 1993-94 AST reported net income of Dollars 26.2m, or
79 cents per share, on revenues of Dollars 1.2bn. Two brokers lowered their
ratings on AST after it said February sales were strong but below
projections. Sales growth in US 'value added' reseller channels - third
parties that sell AST computers with added software or services - grew about
60 per cent over the same month last year rather than 70 per cent as
expected.
