IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
INSECT LINK DISCOUNTED 
Scientists last week reported evidence debunking the theory that a distant 
relative of the AIDS virus that causes leukemia could be spread by insects. The 
researchers said they produced evidence that mosquitoes and ticks do not 
transmit HTLV-1, the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1, a virus related 
to the AIDS virus that causes leukemia. 
"This is reassuring," said Dr. Edward Murphy, an assistant professor of 
laboratory medicine at UC San Francisco, who headed the research reported in a 
letter in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
Some researchers had speculated that HTLV-1 may be spread by insects because it 
is found mostly in the tropics and other areas where insect-borne diseases are 
common. 
The researchers tested 90 Jamaican patients who had antibodies to HTLV-1 for 
antibodies to other viruses transmitted by ticks and mosquitoes and compared 
them to 110 subjects who did not have HTLV-1 antibodies. They found no 
significant evidence that those infected with HTLV-1 were more likely to have 
been exposed to mosquitoes or ticks.
