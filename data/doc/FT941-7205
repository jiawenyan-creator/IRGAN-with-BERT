FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Spain considers reducing Repsol
shareholding
The Spanish government is considering making an international offering of
Repsol shares that could reduce the public sector's shareholding in the
energy and chemicals group from 41.1 per cent to close to 20 per cent.
A government official confirmed that a further reduction of public ownership
of Repsol was being examined, but would not comment on the extent and the
timing of the share offer.
The offering has been provisionally scheduled for the second half of the
year. This will allow the markets to absorb a 10 per cent share offering,
due within the next three months, by the state-owned electricity generator
and distributor Endesa. This offering will reduce the state's equity to
below 60 per cent.
The government gave up majority control of Repsol last year when it placed
13 per cent of its equity on the market, reducing its shareholding from 54.1
per cent to 41.1 per cent. That share offer realised Pta110bn (Dollars
783m): at current market prices a 20 per cent offering would be worth
Pta276bn.
The share offer also has to await the acquisition by Gas Natural, the big
domestic gas distributor 45 per cent-owned by Repsol, of Enagas, the fully
state-owned monopoly supplier of industrial gas. The takeover, which will
create one of the biggest natural gas companies in Europe, is expected to be
announced before the end of next month.
Repsol lifted 1993 consolidated profit by 28.3 per cent, to Pta156.8bn, and
its net profit by 11.4 per cent, to Pta80.1bn, on revenues of Pta2,216bn, 16
per cent up on 1993. Slack demand for petroleum products, and a drop in
revenue from oil exploration and production, were offset by the impact of
the weaker peseta and higher refining margins.
