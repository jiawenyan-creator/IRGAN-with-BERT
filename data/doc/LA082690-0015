RECORD RACK: *** THE NEVILLE BROTHERS "BROTHER'S KEEPER" A&amp;M: ALBUMS ARE 
RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC). 
Undoubtedly, some among the millions who just discovered Aaron Neville, the 
linebacker-size songbird, as a featured duet partner on the recent Linda 
Ronstadt album will buy this fine new Neville Brothers effort. If they expect 
anything close to those cozy Aaron 'n' Linda love songs, though, they're in for 
a surprise. 
Here Aaron shares the vocal spotlight, the syncopation rarely lets up and the 
brothers stick black consciousness and Jesus right in your face. 
Fully half the songs on "Brother's Keeper" are potent gospel tunes (including 
"Jah Love," co-written by Cyril Neville and U2's Bono). More confrontational is 
the two-part "Sons and Daughters," Art Neville's angry, Gil Scott-Heronesque 
look at inner-city despair and Establishment patronizing. 
What's missed is the weird spatial relationships producer Daniel Lanois brought 
to their last album. His cohort Malcolm Burn co-produced with the Nevilles this 
time, and "Keeper" is stuck somewhere between the novel undercurrents of the 
last record and the percussive joy of previous efforts. Nothing here is 
irresistibly danceable, but with all the other merits afoot, the brothers have 
produced yet another keeper. CHRIS WILLMAN
