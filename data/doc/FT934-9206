FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Linde warns of sharp retreat in
fork-lift demand
LINDE, the German engineering group, warned yesterday that group profits for
1993 would be hit by a drastic downturn in demand for fork-lift trucks and
other materials handling machines.
For the nine-months group sales dropped to DM5.17bn (Dollars 3.07m), 4.1 per
cent down on the previous year, while order intake fell 2.7 per cent to
DM5.26bn. For the whole year group sales would be around DM7.2bn, 5 per cent
down from last year, Linde said.
Turnover in the materials handling division fell 17 per cent and orders 16.8
per cent in the nine months, after stripping out the effect of last year's
purchase of Fiat OM Carelli, an Italian fork-lift truck maker.
