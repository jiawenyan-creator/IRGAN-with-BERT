FT  27 FEB 92 / Lloyd's hearings move to Lords
THE Oakeley Vaughan case brought by Lloyd's names moved yesterday to the
House of Lords, where proceedings are expected to last four days. Members of
syndicates managed by the Oakeley Vaughan underwriting agency in the 1980s
allege that negligence by Lloyd's was responsible for losses of more than
Pounds 5m.
The Lords will consider whether Lloyd's has a duty of care to Names who lose
money through the conduct of their agents.
