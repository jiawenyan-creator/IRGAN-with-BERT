FT  05 SEP 92 / Milk board reform attacked
PLANS TO turn the 60-year-old Milk Marketing Board into a single voluntary
co-operative were strongly attacked yesterday by the Dairy Trade Federation,
which represents creameries and dairies.
Mr Brian Smith, federation president, said he could not understand how a
government that believed in a free market could be in favour of the
co-operative proposal.
The federation's reaction is the latest setback in the long process of
reforming the board, which represents nearly 30,000 dairy farmers in England
and Wales. Less than two weeks ago the federation and board failed to agree
on plans to reform the pricing system for milk used in manufacturing.
Mr Smith said the federation approved of the board's proposal to float Dairy
Crest, its wholly owned subsidiary which has a 25 per cent share of the
British market for manufactured dairy products. But it disagreed with the
board keeping its assets, which would be 'disguised incentives' to attract
farmers to the co-op.
The government is expected to publish a bill soon to reform the board.
