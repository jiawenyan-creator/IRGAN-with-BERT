FT  19 OCT 92 / Five found guilty of gold smuggling
FIVE members of a Pounds 35m gold smuggling ring, which included a
solicitor, have been found guilty of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue.
The two couriers, two jewellers and a minder were part of a 'highly
professional gang' which used a fleet of cars to ferry thousands of ingots
into Britain from Luxembourg.
Judge Norma Negus will pass sentence at a later date.
