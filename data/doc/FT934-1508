FT  18 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Re-build more in keeping with the
environment
Sir, Michael Cassell ('Nightmare on Marsham St', December 17) is right to
criticise the current Department of the Environment buildings.
However, one point which I feel he misses is that the other dimension to
these dreadful buildings is the height to which they were constructed. Prior
to 1970 local residents, office workers and visitors were able to enjoy
views of the Palace of Westminster and Westminster Abbey from quite a long
distance away, which added to the agreeable ambience of the general area.
I very much hope that, once these awful buildings have been demolished, the
planners will not allow any reconstruction which exceeds the current
eight-floor limit imposed on other developers in this region over the past
few years.
