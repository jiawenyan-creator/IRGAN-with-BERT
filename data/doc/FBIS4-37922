  [Text] An Israeli commando unit blew up two fishing boats 
in al-Sarafand harbor at dawn today. They were owned by 
fishermen Muhammad 'Abbas 'Atwah and Salim 'Ali Hanana. Seven 
months ago an Israeli unit blew up another boat owned by 'Atwah. 
  Elsewhere, Israeli troops stationed in Qal'at al-Shaqif 
fired 
several shells at the al-Litani River basin. Overnight, an RPG 
shell and bursts of 12.7-mm machine-gun fire targeted a UN 
Interim Force in Lebanon [UNIFIL] helicopter as it landed near 
Tallat al-Khazzan, which is opposite the enemy positions in 
Kafra. The helicopter was flying a patient to al-Naqurah. The 
shelling missed the helicopter.
