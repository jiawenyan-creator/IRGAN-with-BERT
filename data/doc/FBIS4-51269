<F P=106> [From the "Chinese Economic News" column: "Farm Loans </F>
Boosted for Second Half of the Year"] 
  [Text] It has been revealed that, to further increase 
inputs to the agricultural sector, the State Council has decided 
that the proportion of farm loans in the increase of all loans 
for the second half of the year would be raised to 10 percent 
from last year's 6 percent. 
  It has been said that this year the agricultural bank will 
continue to fix the focus of credit loan work on supporting 
agriculture and rural economic development and developing 
industries and products with high additional value, high 
commodity rates, and high exchange rates, while supporting the 
implementation of a strategy for reinvigorating agriculture with 
science and technology, such as the "Spark Plan." The bank 
will also focus on the implementation of the plan for supporting 
the impoverished in the Eighth Five-Year Plan and will guide 
enterprises to enter the market, participate in competition, 
amass funds, and select a number of key projects of enterprises 
in townships and towns to accelerate their technological 
transformation. 
  In 1994, the agricultural bank plans to make arrangements 
for 
farm loans in terms of 29 billion yuan, up by 28 percent from 
the 1993 plan. 
  Since the beginning of this year, the state has decided to 
give focal support to 500 counties that produce commodity grains 
and 150 counties that produce high-quality cotton; at the same 
time, it will set up a number of "two-high, one good-quality" 
exemplary farm zones with various characteristics in different 
regions in a planned way. The agricultural bank will do a good 
job of work in supervising the corresponding loans.
