FT  24 SEP 94 / Trade union setback for Norwegian EU hopes
Norway's Labour government suffered a setback yesterday in its struggle to
win approval for Norwegian membership of the European Union when the LO
blue-collar trade union confederation recommended that its members vote No
in the referendum on November 28.
The LO, whose 780,000 members represent a large chunk of the electorate,
voted by 156-149 at a special congress to recommend a No vote, defying the
pro-EU line of the Labour party to which the LO is closely tied.
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister, has worked hard to keep the
Labour party, by far the country's largest political party, committed to a
Yes vote despite a significant anti-EU stream within its ranks.
She was hoping the LO would do likewise to ensure the entire labour movement
leadership was united behind the Yes campaign.
Instead, the LO vote - and the acrimonious debate that preceded it -
underscored the divisions within the movement which Mrs Brundtland had
hitherto managed to disguise.
The No camp, which holds a strong lead in the opinion polls, hailed the LO
vote as a significant development. 'Psychologically it is very important
that the country's largest wage-earner organisation has said No,' commented
Mr Hallvard Bakke, leader of the anti-EU faction within the Labour party.
An opinion poll earlier this week in the newspaper Aftenposten showed 50 per
cent of Norwegians intended to vote No, with 28 per cent in favour and 22
per cent undecided, a slight strengthening of the No side since August.
The poll also showed the No lead strengthening even if Finland and Sweden,
which vote first, supported entry. In those circumstances 47 per cent would
vote against and 39 per cent for, compared with a No lead of just 43-42 in
August.
