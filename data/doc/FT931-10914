FT  05 FEB 93 / Observer: Bavarian exit
Poor old Wolfgang Botsch. The newly-appointed German minister of posts and
telecommunications, has only been in office for 10 days and he gets to hold
his first big press conference to announce the licence for the new German
cellular telephone network.
Other ministers would fight for a chance to please the electorate by
announcing a deal promising 8,000 new jobs in the depths of a recession. But
it wasn't such a jolly affair for Wolfgang because he had to choose a
consortium from outside his home state of Bavaria. His home team, the
Munich-based BMW and MAN, came a sorry second.
Botsch, who used to be parliamentary leader of the Bavaria-based Christian
Social Union, bent over backwards to explain his decision to his home crowd
 -not least that the decision was as good as made before he got near his
office.
The minister cited endless experts who backed his decision - no less than 50
from outside, and 80 inside the ministry. But that won't convince his more
parochial fans.
