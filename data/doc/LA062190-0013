CALIFORNIA VOTERS APPROVE NEW SPENDING FOR ROADS AND RAILS 
In response to Assemblyman Tom McClintock's "Fools Rush In, Trip on Their Own 
Platform," Commentary, June 7: 
It is clear that the assemblyman's anger over the election results on have 
little to do with anything, but stem from the fact that he is completely out of 
stream with California voters -- even worse, his own constituents, who 
supported Prop. 111. 
While he lambastes the passage of Prop. 111, he gives very little credit to the 
intelligence of the voters and their call to action to deal with the acute 
infrastructure problems we are experiencing -- problems for which he never 
offered a solution in his campaign against Prop. 111, nor in his legislative 
career. 
I always felt he had the easiest job in town in campaigning against Prop. 111 
-- reviving both the public's anger that drove in Prop. 13's tax cuts and, 
ironically, the distrust of his own peers in the Legislature to spend these new 
revenues wisely. 
But now that the voters have spoken and charged McClintock with a job he was 
heretofore unwilling to do -- implementing a long-range transportation plan -- 
let's hope this time he'll listen to them.
