MILITARY PLANE THAT SHUTTLED FRENCH DEFENSE MINISTER DAMAGED IN LANDING 
A French military aircraft made an emergency landing Friday after taking 
Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement to northeastern France, but no one was 
hurt, military sources said. 
The Mystere-20 developed engine trouble shortly after taking off from 
Mulhouse-Basle Airport, where the minister had disembarked, they said. 
It returned to the airport to make an emergency landing but overshot the runway 
and crashed to a halt, sustaining some damage. 
The sources said a military inquiry was under way.
