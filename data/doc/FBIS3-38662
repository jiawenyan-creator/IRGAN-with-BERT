Vienna"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- The CSCE is increasingly shifting its 
activities to Vienna. As Secretary General Wilhelm Hoynck 
stated on Friday [4 February], various CSCE institutions have 
been united in the new CSCE Secretariat in Vienna and have been 
slimmed down in terms of personnel. The number of employees in 
Prague will be reduced from 40 to eight; in Vienna a few more 
will be added to the about 100 employees. Originally, CSCE 
activities were divided between Prague and Vienna. 
  As its seventh observer mission in the former East bloc, the 
CSCE plans a mission in Tajikistan.
