FT  05 JAN 93 / New guidelines for gravel pits
DRAFT guidelines for tighter planning controls on gravel extraction and rock
quarrying in England and Wales were published by the government yesterday.
The Department of the Environment hopes that the guidelines will encourage
the construction industry to open new sources of supply - such as coastal
'superquarries', accessible only from the sea, such as that at Glensanda on
the west coast of Scotland.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England said the guidelines failed
to address the fundamental issue of the environmental damage caused by
mineral extraction.
