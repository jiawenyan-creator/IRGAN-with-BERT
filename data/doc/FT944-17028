FT  11 OCT 94 / French death toll mounts in Algiers
A 62-year-old Frenchman who had lived in Algeria for 20 years has become the
19th and latest French victim of the civil strife which has claimed the
lives of 63 foreigners and an estimated 28,000 Algerians over the past 21
months.
Mr Roger Merle, a consultant engineer, was killed at the weekend in the
industrial zone of Oued Smar, 10km east of Algiers on the road to the
airport. His death comes two days after Algerian security forces found
another Frenchman, Mr Roger Maniere, with his throat cut. He had been
kidnapped six days before in Meftah, south-east of the capital.
The killings prompted Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, to renew his
call for all French citizens whose presence is not indispensable to leave
Algeria. About 1,000 French citizens still live in Algeria.
The radical Islamic Armed Group (GIA) have claimed responsibility for
killing most of the foreigners murdered so far. The latest killings come
three weeks after the Islamic Salvation Front leaders were moved from prison
to house arrest, prompting speculation a dialogue between Gen Liamine
Zeroual, head of state, and more mainstream fundamentalists might be
starting.
Violence is rising in Algeria, with an estimated 400 people killed in the
last week of September. Observers note the increasingly sophisticated
methods used by the Islamic groups, notably bombs detonated by remote
control.
