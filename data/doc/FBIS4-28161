  [Text] Pyongyang, June 5 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
observe "World Day of Environment". 
  Noting that mankind is now facing a grave environmental 
problem, an article of NODONG SINMUN says: 
  One billion people live in very polluted air and about 10 
million people die annually from various diseases caused by 
polluted water worldwide. 
  In capitalist countries the monopolies operate polluting 
factories, without taking anti-pollution measure, seriously 
polluting the environment, while pursuing only profits. 
  Continuous nuclear tests and manufacture of nuclear weapons, 
nuclear war exercises let out a large amount of radioactive 
substances, gravely destroying environment. 
  Mankind demands a blue sky and clean water and air. 
  No small number of countries are increasing investments in 
the protection of environment and taking measures for preventing 
pollution. 
  Korea is called a beautiful land with thick forests and 
clean 
water, free from pollution, thanks to the correct policy of the 
Workers' Party of Korea on environmental protection. 
  A MINJU CHOSON article says: 
  The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
is making all efforts to fulfil its national duty for the 
protection of global environment. The Korean people will 
intensify the work for environmental protection together with 
all the world peaceloving people.
