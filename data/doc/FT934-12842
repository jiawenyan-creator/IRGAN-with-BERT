FT  25 OCT 93 / Barclays to launch direct-mail venture
BARCLAYS, Britain's biggest bank, is setting up a company to produce
direct-mail marketing material for other companies. The bank will use the
computer hardware and software it employs to send information to its own
customers.
The move is part of an effort by its computer operations division to earn
money by offering 'facilities management' to other businesses. Earlier this
year it made a bid to provide computing services to the Department of
Transport.
Barclays is to run the operation from its print works at Gloucester, one of
its three computing centres. The company, called Edotech, will use IBM print
technology and software, and IBM will also help market the company.
Mr Bruce Hotter, managing director of Barclays computer operations, said
advances in software meant that it could print higher-quality statements and
invoices which include customised marketing material.
Edotech is to start with 28 IBM laser printers, but Mr Hotter said that if
there was enough demand from other companies, it would invest in additional
capacity rather than simply offering facilities it was not itself using.
Mr Hotter said Barclays hoped that Edotech would be a way of 'coming round
the back door' to companies which might want other computer facilities
management services, and could be persuaded to consider this by a print
contract.
He said the company would aim to sell services to companies which already
had mailing programmes. These would include direct-marketing agencies,
financial-services companies and local and central government agencies.
Barclays failed to win the contract to buy DVOIT, the company which provides
computer services to the Department of Transport and executive agencies, but
Mr Hotter said it was likely to bid for other government contracts next
year.
