FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Poor fund trading puts BK Vision
into the red
BK Vision, the investment fund controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking
group, tumbled into a SFr30.1m (Dollars 21.42m) loss in the first four
months of 1994 compared with a SFr9.9m profit in the same period last year.
The loss was mainly due to a severe turnround in the fund's trading
performance, from a SFr40.4m profit to a SFr3.9m loss.
The fund sold all of its shares in CS Holding, the financial group built
around Credit Suisse, during the period, apparently at a loss.
The CS Holding stake, consisting of 350,000 bearer shares, was acquired last
November in exchange for shares in CS subsidiary Leu Holding. Its market
value was SFr258m at the end of 1993, but the CS share price fell 18 per
cent in the first four months of 1994. Mr Ebner, BK chairman, signalled in
January that the fund would run down its CS holding. 'The tasks of an owner
shareholder cannot be credibly performed at two big Swiss banks
simultaneously,' he said.
BK Vision is the largest single shareholder in Union Bank of Switzerland
with 5.6 per cent of the capital worth SFr1.95bn at the end of April.
The CS sale left BK Vision's SFr2.5bn portfolio at the end of April holding
securities of only two financial companies, UBS and Zurich Insurance.
The other factor in the fund's loss was a SFr20.1m charge for
administration. Substantially all of this was a performance-related fee to
BZ Trust, the fund's manager, for the fourth quarter of 1993. These fees
have been spectacularly high in recent years, reaching SFr250m in 1993.
However, since the end of January, the share price and net asset value of BK
Vision have been declining.
Mr Ebner pointed out that they were now substantially below the threshold
value of SFr1,758 on which future fees would be calculated. This means that
no fees are likely to be payable for some time.
