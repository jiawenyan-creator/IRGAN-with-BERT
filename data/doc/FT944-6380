FT  30 NOV 94 / Police charged in Thailand
The Thai authorities said yesterday they had charged a police general and
eight others with conspiring to kidnap and murder the wife and son of an
important witness in a long-running scandal involving jewels worth Dollars
20m (Pounds 12.1m) stolen from a Saudi prince. Those charged include police
Lt Gen Chalor Kerdthet, who first headed the investigation into the theft of
gems from a Saudi Arabian palace in 1989, and four other policemen. Gen
Chalor has already been accused of embezzling some of the jewels.
Thailand's Office of the Attorney General dropped plans to charge two other
police generals of involvement in the murder. The case has aroused intense
interest in Thailand because of growing frustration with corruption in the
country's police force. At least 10 people are believed to have been
murdered in connection with the case. Angered by the slow pace of the
investigation, Saudi Arabia has refused to grant new visas to Thai migrant
workers and stopped Saudi tourists from visiting Thailand.
The Thai gardener who stole the jewels in Saudi Arabia was arrested after
his return to Thailand, but the gems returned by the police to the Saudi
prince turned out to be fakes copied from the originals. Most of the real
gems are still missing.
