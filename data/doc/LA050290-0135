MITSUBISHI TO TAKE CONTROL OF FLORIDA RENTAL CAR FIRM 
Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America announced Tuesday that it has agreed to 
acquire a majority stake in Value Rent-A-Car Inc. for an undisclosed sum. 
Mitsubishi said control of the Deerfield, Fla. 
-based rental car firm, which operates 25 rental outlets in six states, would 
provide added exposure for Mitsubishi products and good used cars for 
Mitsubishi's 416 U.S. dealers. 
The sale, scheduled to be completed by May 31, calls for Cypress-based 
Mitsubishi Motor Sales to acquire more than 50% of Value's stock and all of the 
company's real estate holdings. Most of Value's operations are in Florida, but 
the company also has facilities in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Louisiana and 
Nevada. 
Mitsubishi Motor Sales, a bit player for most of the seven years it has been 
selling cars in the United States, has experienced a sales surge recently on 
the strength of a revamped product line. It has advanced to fourth place among 
Japanese car companies in this country. 
The company imports cars and light trucks built by Mitsubishi Motor Corp. in 
Japan and also sells vehicles produced by the Diamond Star Motors plant in 
Illinois, a joint venture between Mitsubishi and Chrysler Corp. 
Fleet sales currently account for about 15% of Mitsubishi's sales, which 
totaled 150,476 vehicles last year. That percentage will not change with the 
acquisition of Value, the company said. But the portion of Mitsubishi vehicles 
in the Value fleet will jump from 10% to 85% by year's end.
