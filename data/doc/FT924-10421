FT  31 OCT 92 / The Financial Times Guide To Post-16 Education 3: How we did
it
The FT-1000 survey is the result of six months' research. A total of 2,700
schools and colleges in both the state and independent sectors were sent
detailed questionnaires. In addition, the Independent Schools' Information
Service (ISIS) supplied compatible data on 500 (the majority) of its
members.
Every school and college was telephoned to confirm receipt of the
questionnaire and a second abbreviated form was sent out to those that had
not replied by our original deadline. FT researchers sent out a total of
5,500 questionnaires and forms, and made more than 7,500 telephone calls.
By our final deadline, details of nearly 1,400 schools and colleges had been
entered on our data base. Respondents were then sent data checking sheets to
enable them to verify their entry and amend A-level grades where there had
been a successful appeal to the examining board. The FT-1000, which includes
1,200 schools and colleges and is the most extensive listing of its kind yet
published, includes all those respondents with at least ten A-level
candidates who submitted full details of their 1992 A-level results.
