WORLD; 
MANDELA WEARY, SAYS HE MIGHT HAVE TO CURTAIL HEAVY SCHEDULE 
South African black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela, whose grueling world 
tour is giving rise to concern for his health, said today he is fine but that 
he might have to cut his schedule. 
Earlier in the day Mandela, who is set to visit the United States June 20, 
abruptly canceled an appointment with officials of the International Committee 
of the Red Cross for an unscheduled rest in his hotel room. 
"I don't know how I look but I feel good," the 71-year-old activist told 
reporters as he arrived at the headquarters of the World Council of Churches 
later to thank its members for their militant anti-apartheid stand. 
But he admitted he might have to cut down on his heavy schedule, which is to 
cover 13 countries in six weeks. 
"That is likely, quite possible, but it is different from saying I have done so 
because I am ill," he said. 
Mandela had surgery of an unspecified nature only last week.
