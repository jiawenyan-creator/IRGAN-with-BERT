FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Enterprise Computer cuts loss
ENTERPRISE Computer Hold-ings, the computing services group undergoing
radical market repositioning, lost Pounds 5.89m pre-tax in the year to March
31.
Turnover was Pounds 58.2m against Pounds 157.9m for the previous 15 months
when losses amounted to Pounds 8.33m. Overhead costs, however, were halved
to Pounds 9.7m on a comparable basis.
There was an extraordinary loss of Pounds 365,000 to provide for the closure
of subsidiaries.
Losses per share were 7.4p (9.8p). No dividend is declared for the year
(1.25p for 15 months).
Mr John Small, chairman, said the reduction in turnover reflected a
substantial change in the pattern of group sales during the year. There had
been a sharp reduction in the volume of purchase and sale of second-user
mainframe computers, which had been the company's core business.
The company is now concentrating on computing services, which have a lower
sales value but offer a better quality of sustainable business and higher
profit margins.
During the year, the group entered a strategic alliance with Granada
Computer Services International, a provider of computer maintenance. Under
the terms of the alliance the two companies will work together to provide a
broad range of maintenance and information technology services.
Mr Small said early results for the current year showed an encouraging
improvement over the same period last year.
