interest including Bosnia Herzegovina, Palestine, Afghanistan, 
and Kashmir. 
  Pakistani Minister of the Interior Nasrullah Khan Babar told 
his Iranian counterpart 'Ali Mohammad Besharati, that the war of 
the Serbs against the Muslim people of Bosnia-Herzegovina is "a 
war of the West with the entirety of the Muslim world."

states in Geneva would help to ease pressure on Muslims 
especially of Kashmir. 
  Besharati assured that the Islamic Republic of Iran would 
continue to be on the side of Pakistan. He added that frequent 
exchange of visits between the ranking officials of the two 
countries was sufficient proof of the interest of both countries

trafficking as a "common issue" about which the two countries 
were equally concerned. He said Iran and Pakistan continued 
their mutual efforts to end that problem.

understanding on joint commitment to fight drug trafficking 
along the two countries common borders.
