FT  17 NOV 93 / Fewer have water supply cut off
FEWER CUSTOMERS are having water supplies cut off for non-payment of bills,
according to figures released yesterday by the Office of Water Services, the
industry's watchdog in England and Wales.
Between April and September there were 5,924 domestic disconnections in
England and Wales, compared to 8,272 in the same period last year.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat director-general, said the number was less than a tenth
of 1 per cent of all customers.
Last year Ofwat expressed concern about the number of disconnections.
