FT  15 JAN 94 / International Company News: Wal-Mart to extend store chain
into Canada
Wal-Mart, the biggest retailer in the US, is to spread its discount store
empire into Canada. It is buying 120 of Woolworth Canada's 142 Woolco
superstores for an undisclosed sum, and turning them into Wal-Mart outlets.
The deal marks a significant expansion for Wal-Mart. Although the company
has more than 2,000 stores operating under the Wal-Mart name, and 360
membership warehouses operating under the Sam's Club name, the Canadian move
will be its first venture outside the US, Puerto Rico and Mexico.
Canadian retailing stocks fell sharply as investors responded nervously to
the threat of increased competition. Shares in Hudson's Bay, the country's
biggest retailer, fell CDollars 4 1/8 to CDollars 35 3/4 .
Woolworth Canada's US parent said the Woolco stores were being sold in line
with its strategy of switching away from general merchandising to
concentrate on higher-growth specialty retailing outlets such as Foot Locker
and Northern Reflections.
In October the group announced a restructuring involving the closure of 970
stores in the US and Canada. Yesterday it emphasised it was not pulling out
of Canada.
