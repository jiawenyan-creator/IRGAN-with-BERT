  [Excerpts] Brasilia, 20 May (AE) -- Today, Senator Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso (PSDB-SP) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Sao 
Paulo] took another step toward obtaining former President Jose 
Sarney's support for his presidential candidacy. Deputy 
Zequinha Sarney (PFL-MA) [Liberal Front Party-Maranhao State), a 
son of Sarney, has been asked to join the political council of 
the "Union, Work, and Progress" coalition campaign. The 
coalition consists of the PSDB, PFL, and Brazilian Labor Party. 
As part of his strategy to earn Sarney's support, Cardoso is 
planning to announce soon his support for the continuation of 
the North-South railway project, an unfinished Sarney project.

  On 18 May, Cardoso and Senator Guilherme Palmeira 
(PFL-Amapa), the coalition's candidate for vice president, met 
at the plenary session room of the Chamber of Deputies with 
Deputy Roseana Sarney (PFL-MA), Sarney's daughter and candidate 
for governor of Maranhao State. She conditioned her father's 
group's support for Cardoso to a political agreement in 
Maranhao, where the PSDB is planning to enter into a coalition 
with Senator Epitacio Cafeteira (Popular Renewal Party), her 
opponent in the Maranhao gubernatorial race. [passage omitted]
