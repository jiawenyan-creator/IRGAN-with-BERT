FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lilliput grows 53% to Pounds 3m
Lilliput Group, the maker of hand-painted miniature china cottages that was
floated in November, boosted profits by 53 per cent and sales by 21 per cent
for 1993.
The pre-tax figure rose from Pounds 2.01m to Pounds 3.08m on turnover up
from Pounds 13.6m to Pounds 16.5m.
A dividend of 0.6p is proposed, in line with the prospectus forecast and
equivalent to 4.35p if the shares had been trading for a full year. Earnings
per share were 9.5p (6.7p).
Sales in the UK, which accounts for more than 60 per cent of turnover, were
up by 25 per cent. The US, the second biggest market with 27 per cent of
sales, improved by 10 per cent. In order to cope with demand, the group
created 100 new jobs in the year.
Membership of the collectors' club - a vehicle to stimulate demand for the
models - rose from 58,000 to 68,500.
Mr John Russell, chairman and chief executive, said membership had risen to
71,500 in the first two months of this year 'and the momentum is still
growing.'
Net interest receivable was Pounds 24,000, compared with payable interest of
Pounds 121,000 last time.
The Cumbria-based group ended 1993 with Pounds 4m cash. Mr Russell said it
was looking for an acquisition where it could use its skills in marketing
collectable products.
Mr Roger Fitness, chief executive, who led the group's move into the US
market, has resigned for personal reasons. He will remain as a consultant
for a minimum of three months. Mr Russell is assuming the role until a new
chief executive is appointed.
