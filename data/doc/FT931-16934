FT  04 JAN 93 / China seeks to reassure Hong Kong investors
CHINA sought to reassure international and local Hong Kong investors
yesterday, saying that it would honour contracts which span the transfer of
Hong Kong's sovereignty in 1997.
Mr Lu Ping, Beijing's senior official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, said
in a television interview last night that although China no longer trusted
Britain 'we accept our obligations' in respect of commercial contracts.
Mr Lu maintained China's uncompromising opposition to Hong Kong's political
development unveiled last October by Mr Chris Patten, the governor. He said
Mr Patten would have to withdraw his proposals before China and the UK could
talk about the colony's political development.
Mr Lu warned that if Britain went ahead with the governor's proposals China
would 'start afresh' in 1997 and hold elections which conformed to the Basic
Law - the Beijing-drafted constitution for the colony after its reversion to
Chinese sovereignty.
He said China did not want 'a diplomatic war' with Britain. He blamed the UK
for the deterioration in relations, reiterating China's claim that Britain
had reneged on past agreements concerning Hong Kong's political development.
In general, however, Mr Lu's comments were conciliatory and appeared to mark
a change in stance by Beijing by separating the economic aspects of the
transfer of sovereignty from the political aspects. 'I think we've got to
come back with something friendly after this,' said one Foreign Office
official.
Last month Beijing's warning that it would not honour contracts made by the
Hong Kong government with other parties which had not been approved by China
sent the local stock market into steep decline. But its attempt to unsettle
Hong Kong's economy had an unintended consequence, when the questions
Beijing raised about contracts also promoted fears in international bankers'
minds about the reliability of China as a borrower.
