FT  04 DEC 92 / TSSA drops threat to Tube
A THREAT of industrial action against London Underground by the TSSA
white-collar union was called off yesterday even though members had voted
narrowly in favour of action in a ballot last month.
All three rail unions have now decided against industrial action in
opposition to London Underground's new pay and conditions package.
