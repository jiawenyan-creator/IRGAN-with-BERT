FT  01 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Old-fashioned tip-off led The Sun
to story
THE SUN'S exclusive on Mr Norman Lamont's Access bill came about in a very
old-fashioned way - a call out of the blue to the paper's newsdesk, Raymond
Snoddy writes.
If a conspiracy against the chancellor of the exchequer was involved then it
was a very elaborate one.
All the signs point to someone trying to make some money - and a relatively
small amount - out of confidental information on Mr Lamont's personal
finances.
The man who contacted the Sun over the Access account was representing the
person who had direct access to the information. At no stage did Sun
reporters meet anyone other than the third-party contact.
The Sun is understood to have paid only around Pounds 200 for the story,
considerably less than it might have been worth.
It is believed that Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, had no doubts,
then or now, that the story was an important one and that it was right for
the paper to print it.
Yesterday the paper had a measure of comfort for the beleaguered chancellor,
showing a copy of Mr Lamont's wine bill indicating that he had, as he
claimed, bought three bottles of claret on November 15 the day before it had
been suggested he had bought champagne and cigarettes.
There was also support for Mr Lamont in his new controversy over the public
contribution towards the costs of evicting a tenant from his house.
Meanwhile Lord McGregor, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, is
likely to have conversations with his colleagues to see whether publication
of the story might have breached at least the spirit of the newspaper
industry's code of practice. The question is likely to be whether it was
right for the newspaper to publish information normally considered
confidential when there was no question of Mr Lamont having done anything
illegal.
