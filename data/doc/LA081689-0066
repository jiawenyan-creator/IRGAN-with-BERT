At least 20 people were injured in a clash between supporters of rival 
political parties in the central Mexican city of Morelia, police said. A 
spokesman said three of the 20 were seriously hurt in the clash between 
followers of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and the opposition 
center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution. The clash took place as an 
electoral college began meeting to ratify the results of local elections held 
July 2 in Michoacan state, of which Morelia is the capital. The opposition 
disputes official results given so far, which indicate the ruling party won 
with 12 of 18 electoral districts.
