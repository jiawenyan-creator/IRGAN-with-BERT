FT  19 AUG 92 / Morning after in the pub: Recent efforts to inject more
competition into the UK brewing market have largely backfired
Norfolk Nog was recently judged the champion beer of Britain at the Campaign
for Real Ale's festival in London. Yet the beer, made by Woodforde's of
Norwich, a small, independent brewer, is sold in only 300 of the country's
60,000 pubs and clubs.
'A few more pubs have called us to order the beer since it won the award,'
says Mr Ray Ashworth, Woodforde's managing director. 'The beer is
competitive on price as well as quality. But pubs are so heavily committed
to the national brewers that it is very difficult to increase distribution.'
Three years after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission set out to inject
more competition into the UK's beer market  - worth Pounds 13bn a year in
retail sales  - Woodforde's experience is a sad reflection on what has been
achieved.
The restructuring  - aimed at breaking the dominance of the large national
brewers by loosening the ties between brewing and pub ownership, and carried
out against a recessionary background  - is now almost complete.
So far, the result has been fewer brewers, fewer breweries and fewer beer
brands. Breaking the tie between brewing and pub ownership has brought new
retailers into the market, but it has also led to some big rent increases
and pub closures.
Meanwhile, the commission, in its recent report on the proposed merger of
the brewing operations of Allied-Lyons and Carlsberg, the Danish brewer,
admits: 'The strength of the national brewers is undiminished.'
The price of a pint of bitter, instead of dropping, rose last year by 12.8
per cent before tax, compared with a 4.5 per cent increase in the retail
price index. Brewers blame higher investment and financing costs.
So what has gone wrong? The answer lies in the commission's diagnosis of the
industry's competitive weaknesses and the remedy it prescribed.
Competition already existed between the pubs belonging to the six national
UK brewers  - Bass, Allied-Lyons, Whitbread, Courage, Grand Metropolitan and
Scottish &amp; Newcastle  - according to Mr Leif Mills, head of Bifu, the
banking union, and a member of the commission. He wrote a dissenting note to
the commission's 1989 report recommending the restructuring. The brewers
were responding to changing consumer demands, he said. There were physical
limits to what any pub could offer its customers, and new owners were
unlikely to widen the choice beyond the most profitable, highly advertised
brands.
Mr Mills also warned that wherever brewing had been separated from retailing
 - as in the US  - the result had been to concentrate beer production in
fewer hands.
His predictions have proved remarkably accurate. The nationals' response to
the commission's intervention has been a series of corporate deals
tightening their grip on beer production and enabling them to minimise the
effects of their pub disposals. These include:
A Pounds 2.4bn pubs-for-breweries swap between Grand Metropolitan and
Courage, the Australian brewer, set the pace early last year. Courage took
over GrandMet's breweries to become the country's second-biggest brewer with
a 20 per cent market share. The two companies' 7,000 pubs have gone into a
joint venture managed by GrandMet.
A Pounds 510m merger of the UK brewing operations of Allied-Lyons and
Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, is set to go ahead after minor modifications
demanded by the commission. The new company, Carlsberg-Tetley, will have an
18 per cent share of the market.
Allied and Whitbread have benefited from the decisions of three regional
brewers  - Boddington, Devenish and Greenalls  - to dispose of their
uneconomic breweries and concentrate on pub retailing. Whitbread bought the
Boddington and Devenish brands; Allied now brews Greenalls' beer.
Further brewery closures have come with the nationals' search for production
economies. Bass, the industry leader with a 23 per cent market share, has
led the way by shutting four plants.
As a result of this corporate activity, five national brewers now control 82
per cent of the country's beer production compared with 77 per cent held by
the six national brewers in 1989. Concentration of lager production is even
more marked.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which baulked at the thought of two
brewers controlling 40 per cent of production when it barred the Elders bid
for Scottish &amp; Newcastle at the time of the 1989 report, now apparently
views such concentration with equanimity.
Indeed, the commission almost caused the demise of another regional brewer
that it had sought to protect. Its insistence that Whitbread's associated
investment company should reduce its shareholding in Morland, the
Oxfordshire brewer, exposed that company to a hostile bid from Greene King
that only narrowly failed in July. A similar threat still hangs over
Marston, the Burton-based brewer, in which Whitbread has a 33 per cent
stake.
The concentration of production  - which many City observers believe will go
further  - seems a poor trade-off for what the commission has achieved on
the retail side of the industry. The commission recommended that the big six
brewers should be forced to dispose of 22,000 pubs  - two-thirds of their
total holdings. The government compromised. It ordered them to allow their
tenant licensees, who rent about 21,000 pubs, to buy spirits, cider, soft
drinks and one brand of cask-conditioned ale from any supplier. This 'guest
ale' provision was intended to benefit regional brewers by giving their
products access to the nationals' pubs from which they had generally been
barred.
However, after three years, fewer than a third of the nationals' tenants
have taken advantage of the guest-ale provision to stock a regional brewer's
product. Only a few regionals with strong brands, such as Marston, Greene
King and Fuller, have benefited and they have had to rely on distribution
deals with the nationals.
'The nationals have usurped the guest-ale market,' says Mr Iain Loe of the
Campaign for Real Ale. 'They have padded out their own portfolios with a few
key brands and it is still very difficult for smaller brewers to get a look
in.'
Many of the regionals have struck back, however. Some have strengthened
their trading operations by buying about a quarter of the 11,000 pubs sold
by the nationals. The disposal programme has also enabled many of the
brewers' former tenants to become individual pub owners. New retailers,
whose entry to the trade has been limited by a restrictive licensing system,
have bought pubs throughout the country. Some, such as Enterprise Inns and
Century Inns, have rapidly built up chains of several hundred pubs.
But few of the consumer benefits expected to flow from increased competition
have materialised. Each of the big brewers has retained most of the beer
supplies to the pubs they have sold or leased. They have protected their
positions by means of long-term supply agreements or such inducements as
cheap loans.
Three years ago, the commission concluded that the reliance of supposedly
independent pubs on subsidised loans from their brewer restricted the entry
of new suppliers and adversely affected competition. The commission
recommended prohibiting such loans.
However, the government did not ban the practice, and it has grown despite
its potential pitfalls  - demonstrated by Whitbread's provisions this year
for Pounds 37m of bad debts. National brewers' sales to loan-tied houses
have risen since 1989 from 5.6m to 5.9m barrels.
Long-term supply agreements, designed to maintain the brewer's sales to pubs
that it has sold, are a more recent feature. The Office of Fair Trading has
already taken action to discourage such moves by imposing time limits on
Courage's supplies to GrandMet and to their joint pubs venture, and on
Allied's arrangements to supply Brent Walker, the leisure group to which it
has leased 734 pubs.
In their defence, the national brewers argue that retailers benefit from a
single comprehensive supply service. 'Such agreements are entered into as a
result of negotiation between willing buyers and sellers, involving active
competition between brewers for business, and have contributed to a dramatic
decline in wholesale prices in recent years,' Allied says.
Professor M E Beesley, one of the commission members who inquired into the
Allied-Carlsberg merger proposals, agrees. 'These are methods by which
rivalry is now pursued,' he says. 'They are not the restoration of a
forbidden monopolistic practice.'
Though unconvinced, his colleagues' concerns appear to have been eased by
evidence from many retailers that competition for business with the
independent pub sector  - which now accounts for nearly half of total pub
beer sales compared with 37 per cent in 1989  - has brought real reductions
in wholesale beer prices.
So why have retail prices continued to outpace inflation? The brewers have
several explanations. Substantial sums have been invested in refurbishing
pubs during the past few years. Some of the new, independent pub companies
have borrowed heavily and had to raise cash, in difficult trading
conditions, to meet interest payments. Pub tenants are paying higher rents.
But higher prices have provoked consumer resistance, and with the pub-going
population in decline, many pubs that enjoyed a degree of financial
protection as part of the large brewers' estates face a bleak future as
standalone businesses.
'There are fewer pubs already, and soon there will be fewer still as
retailers find they cannot cope with reduced trade and higher costs,' says
Mr David Thompson, an industry observer analyst at Kleinwort Benson, the
securities house. 'That means less consumer choice.'
The OFT will begin its assessment of the impact of the commission's
intervention this winter. The industry expects further upheavals to follow;
consumers have learned not to expect much from them.
