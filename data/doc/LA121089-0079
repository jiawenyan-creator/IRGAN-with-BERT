"Literary Britain" unearthed old memories of one of my own precious literary 
moments in England. First it was the train to Windsor, the tour and a picnic 
lunch across the river from the castle. Then down narrow country lanes to the 
quaint village of Stoke Poges, the setting for Thomas Gray's immortal poem, 
"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard." It was a mystical experience.
