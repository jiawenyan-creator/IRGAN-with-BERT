Israeli forces in al-Zaffatah bombarded Iqlim al-Tuffah villages 
and heights, particularly Mlita, Jabal Safi, al-Luwayzah, and 
al-Jabal al-Akhdar. Israeli forces located in 'Alman pounded 
the al-Litani River basin and the outskirts of Zawtar 
al-Gharbiyah and Zawtar al- Sharqiyah. Israeli vehicular 
movements were spotted in the area. 
  A formation of Israeli military aircraft flew two sorties in

staging mock raids and drawing antiaircraft fire. Meanwhile 
Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier over Beirut and
