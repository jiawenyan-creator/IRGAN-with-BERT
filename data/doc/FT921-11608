FT  30 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries sharply lower as hopes of rate
cuts fade
COMMENTS from US Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan which appeared
to dash hopes of further interest rate cuts left bond prices sharply lower
yesterday at the end of a volatile day's trading.
By the late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 31/32
at 102 15/16 , yielding 7.742 per cent. The two-year note was also lower,
down  1/16 at 99 17/32 , yielding 5.108 per cent.
After worrying Mr Bush might announce extensive tax cut proposals in his
State of the Union speech to Congress on Tuesday night, bond investors were
relieved that the measures outlined were relatively modest, and by midday
prices were higher across the board. The realisation that Mr Bush's fiscal
fine-tuning would still leave the Federal deficit at a record Dollars 399bn
in 1992, was not so warmly received.
The market took a sudden downturn mid-afternoon after Mr Greenspan told the
Senate Banking Committee that monetary policy was probably loose enough
already to produce an economic recovery. Prices were also pressured by a
fresh injection of corporate debt. Investors and dealers have been loaded
down with new corporate debt recently, leaving them with less of an appetite
for Treasury securities.
ACTIVITY in the UK government bond market yesterday was dominated by the
Bank of England's auction of Pounds 1.8bn of 10-year gilts.
The average accepted bid for the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 was 102 5/32 ,
yielding 9.42 per cent, while the lowest accepted bid was 102 3/32 ,
yielding 9.43 per cent. Bids amounted to Pounds 3.64bn, giving a
bid-to-cover ratio of 2.02. Traders said the demand was better than
expected, particularly from foreign investors keen on buying the 10-year
sector.
The Liffe bund futures contract slipped from its opening of 97.20 to 97.17
while the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 was unchanged on the
day at 115 15/16 .
THE German government bond market fell as bondholders took profits and
switched out of short-dated bund issues.
The market kicked off on a firm note, taking its cue from the US Treasury
bond market which was strong overnight. But, the Liffe bund futures contract
later fell from its opening of 88.55 to trade at 88.36 by late afternoon, as
traders noted some switching out of short-dated issues on fears that German
interest rates are likely to remain high for some time. The announcement of
western German cost of living figures also prompted some profit-taking. The
cost of living was 0.5 per cent higher in January and was up 4.0 per cent on
January 1991.
The Dutch Ministry of Finance closed its latest offering of the 8.25 per
cent 15-year tap issue after raising Fl 5.5bn. The Finance Ministry said the
average price of the 15-year bonds in the offering was 99.58 with a yield of
8.30 per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds ended firmer, taking their lead from the strength
of the US Treasury bond market.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 bond moved from its opening level of 5.25
per cent to close at 5.23 per cent, despite a rise in short-term interest
rates. The rate on three-month certificates of deposit rose to 5.10 per cent
from 5.07 per cent on Tuesday, while the unsecured call money rate rose by
5/32 to 5 23/32 per cent.
The Finance Ministry sold Y472.64bn of 5.5 per cent 10-year government bonds
at an average price of 100.82 yielding 5.373 per cent. Although a total of
Y800bn of the 10-year issue was offered for sale, as usual 60 per cent is
placed through the auction while the remainder is sold through the
underwriters' syndicate.
