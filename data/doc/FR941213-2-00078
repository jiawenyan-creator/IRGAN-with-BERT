and discussion of the ITAC structure, working methods, and priorities; (2) a review of the ITU Plenipotentiary Conference
held recently in Kyoto, to identify follow-on tasks; (3) status report on preparations for the 1998 Plenipotentiary,
to be hosted by the United States; and (4) the establishment of ad hoc groups to deal with specific areas of interest
(such as, to provide advice on participation in OECD, APEC and CITEL).

chair and seating availability. In this regard, entry to the building is controlled. All persons planning to attend
