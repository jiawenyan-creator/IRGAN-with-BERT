SHORT TAKES; 
SINGER DIDN'T NEED OWN TROUT 
Country music singer T. G. Sheppard was afraid the fish wouldn't bite during 
filming for a cable TV show -- so he took a few extras with him. 
Turns out he didn't need to. 
Sheppard brought some rainbow trout with him on the Little Pigeon River 
Thursday while filming the fishing show for the Nashville Network, but he 
caught his own fish and didn't have to use them. 
The singer dubbed the unofficial ambassador of tourism for this southeastern 
Tennessee city moved here in 1987 and owns a restaurant-bar and a 
bed-and-breakfast inn. 
His recordings include the songs "I Loved 'Em Every One" and "Slow Burn."
