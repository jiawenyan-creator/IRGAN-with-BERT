FT  05 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Dresdner Bank - Other companies
The second of Germany's big three banks presents its 1993 results to the
press in Frankfurt today. Operating results, up 16 per cent after 10 months,
are expected to have improved further, following Deutsche Bank's showing
last week. Delivery of a half-promised dividend increase - the first since
1989 - will help consolidate the view that the worst is past for the German
economy.
