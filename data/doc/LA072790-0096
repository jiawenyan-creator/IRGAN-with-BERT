ASTHMA DEATH RATE UP MORE THAN 30% 
The nation's death rate from asthma has increased by more than 30% in seven 
years, and nearly 10 million Americans are now affected by the chronic disease 
characterized by difficulty in breathing, the national Centers for Disease 
Control in Atlanta reported. Officials said a number of factors -- including 
exposure to infections and other "triggers" for bronchial constriction, 
health-care factors and air quality -- may contribute to the increase. Between 
1980 and 1987, the death rate from asthma in the United States rose from 1.3 
per 100,000 population to 1.7, according to the CDC.
