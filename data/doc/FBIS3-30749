  [Text] Should there be any breakup in the coalition, it 
will certainly not be over my part in the government but is far 
more likely to be over principles of cooperation, the 
application of which I had demanded in talks with the prime 
minister, and also perhaps over purely substantive matters, said 
Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and finance minister, in 
an interview for the GLOS WIELKOLPOLSKI newspaper. 
  Borowski also insisted that, if the prime minister were not 
to accept his resignation, cooperation on the same conditions as 
had existed to date was impossible.
