FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: US banks take lead in European
M&amp;A
US investment banks have moved to the forefront in the competition for
advisory work in Europe's cross-border mergers and acquisitions market.
Morgan Stanley topped the rankings for cross-border European activity
between January and June 1994 on a list compiled by the specialist
publication Acquisitions Monthly.
The New York-based firm acted as financial adviser on 13 deals completed in
the first half, worth a total of Pounds 4.95bn (Dollars 7.66bn). Goldman
Sachs, another US investment bank, was second with 16 deals worth Pounds
4.41bn.
They displaced Lazard and Morgan Grenfell, which led the league table in
1993 but fell to ninth and fifth place respectively.
The figures for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were boosted by their
involvement on either side of the largest M&amp;A transaction completed in 1994,
the acquisition by Akzo of the Netherlands of Nobel Industries, the Swedish
chemicals and explosives maker.
One such deal can sharply alter a league table based on a relatively short
six-month period. Mr Stephen Waters, head of European investment banking for
Morgan Stanley in Europe, welcomed the firm's showing but noted: 'One
swallow does not make a summer.'
Investment bankers also pointed out that the figures referred to closed
deals, which lag announcements, and therefore give an outdated picture of
the state of competition among investment banks.
Nor does the Acquisitions Monthly table include the privatisation and
joint-venture work which is increasingly important in Europe.
