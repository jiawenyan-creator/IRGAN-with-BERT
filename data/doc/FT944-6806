FT  28 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Brazil
The Brazilian stock market this year has been the world's best-performing in
dollar terms, up an astonishing 80 per cent. But last week the Bovespa index
plummeted nearly 10 per cent. The question is whether it was a hiccup in its
progress or represented the start of a more fundamental derating.
In part, the descent was due to the general fall in international equity
markets. Investors have also been locking in profits during reassuringly
thin trading. But the key to longer term growth will be the incoming
government's ability to control inflation which has already fallen from a
peak of 50 per cent to 3.5 per cent a month. Some commentators believe that
if inflation can be successfully controlled, the economy could expand 6 per
cent a year for the next decade. Private sector earnings growth could be
spectacular in an economy expanding that fast.
Investors must hope the record of past Brazilian governments represents no
guide to the future performance of this administration. After all, the
latest economic plan is the seventh in eight years. However, this time there
is consensus that a return to hyper-inflation must be avoided at all costs.
All depends on the administration's ability to control the budget deficit. A
positive conclusion to the constitutional reform necessary to limit the
spending power of regional government is not guaranteed, but the chances are
better than for many years. Until those reforms are agreed, probably not
before June, the market will remain highly volatile. But if reform is
implemented, then prospects are bright, with Brazil set to become an
important constituent of international investment funds. If not, all bets
are off.
