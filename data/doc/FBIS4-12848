  [Text] The Iraqi Government has pledged to pay the back 
salaries of Egyptian workers, estimated at $500 million. An 
Iraqi diplomatic source in Cairo has affirmed that his 
government submitted an official request to the Security Council 
in the past few days to release part of the frozen Iraqi assets 
to pay the Egyptian workers. The source noted that Baghdad had 
requested Egypt's assistance in obtaining the Security Council's 
approval. 
  Iraqi Labor Minister Latif Nusayyif Jasim and Egyptian 
Manpower Minister Ahmad al-'Amawi discussed ways of paying the 
Egyptian workers their salaries. 
  The Iraqi source pointed out that Iraq has pledged to pay 
the 
salaries if the Security Council allows Iraq to sell its oil or 
eases the international blockade. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry 
has received reports from the Egyptian Interests Section in Iraq 
on the situation of 80,000 Egyptian workers there.
