What a wonderful surprise "Archie: To Riverdale and Back Again" was. 
Christopher Rich as Archie was an absolute delight -- the perfect incarnation 
of red-haired, freckle-faced ingenuousness. 
As a fan of Archie comics for over 20 years, I found the entire production 
impeccably cast and well-written, faithfully capturing all the charm and humor 
of the comic books.
