  [Text] Geneva, 27 Apr -- An ITAR-TASS correspondent has 
been told by Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special 
envoy to former Yugoslavia, that a contact group set up by 
Russia, the United States, the European Union, and the United 
Nations to coordinate diplomatic efforts in the Bosnian 
settlement is being sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Russia is 
represented in the group by Foreign Ministry representative 
Aleksey Nikiforov. 
  The group is to meet the leaders of the warring sides to 
look 
into their readiness to conclude an agreement on an all-round 
cease-fire between the Bosnian Serbs and the Muslims. Churkin 
noted that the conclusion of the agreement would be an important 
step towards a comprehensive settlement. 
  For the time being though, despite a relatively "quiet" 
night 
after the expiration of the NATO deadline for pulling back heavy 
weapons from Gorazde, the diplomat believes that the situation 
remains difficult and requires unremitting attention.
