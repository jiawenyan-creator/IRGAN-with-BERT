MORNING REPORT: MOVIES 
Director John Waters, who once described his movies as "comedies for a special 
audience who think they've seen everything" and who attained cult status as a 
quirky director with "Hairspray" and "Polyester," is giving his scripts, 
scrapbooks, costumes and other memorabilia to Wesleyan University in 
Middletown, Conn. His collection joins that of Clint Eastwood, Frank Crapra, 
Ingrid Bergman and Elia Kazan, among others, who have donated their papers to 
the school's Cinema Archives. "It's a massive collection, and because he is an 
active film maker, it will continue to come to us over the years," said the 
university's archives curator. ALEENE MacMINN
