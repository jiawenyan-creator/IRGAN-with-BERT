FT  19 NOV 94 / Court reverse for Ciller
A ruling late on Thursday by Turkey's constitutional court forcing prime
minister Tansu Ciller to postpone crucial by-elections scheduled for
December 4 has increased speculation that she may call general elections in
the spring. The court's decision is a humiliating reverse for Mrs Ciller. It
accepted an appeal by the Islamic Refah party and threw out voting rules she
had devised to minimise damage to her True Path party. Sixteen of the 22
seats up for grabs on December 4 are in the south-east region, scene of
heavy fighting between security forces and guerrillas of the Kurdistan
Workers party. Mrs Ciller's voting rules would have allowed the
greatly-increased number of state employees in the region to vote but would
have disenfranchised the estimated 2m Kurdish villagers who have fled the
fighting. The 16 seats were vacated by Kurdish MPs evicted from parliament
in March to stand trial on treason charges. Their support has been
transferred to Refah, which was expected to win most of the seats,
endangering the coalition governments's thin parliamentary majority.
