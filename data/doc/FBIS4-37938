  [Text] The TIPH [Temporary International Presence in 
Hebron] spokesman says that despite the fact that the force's 
mandate ends on 8 August, the observers have still received no 
order to leave Hebron. The spokesman issued his statement in 
the wake of reports in Israeli media over the weekend regarding 
the Security Council's decision not to extend the mandate.
