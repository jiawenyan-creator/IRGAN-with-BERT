FT  11 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Park Food rises 15% and buys competitor for
Pounds 10m
Park Food Group, which specialises in the sale of Christmas hampers,
yesterday reported record annual profits and announced the acquisition of a
competitor.
For the year ended March 31 pre-tax profits rose by 15 per cent to Pounds
11.8m while sales were more than 18 per cent ahead at Pounds 137.3m (Pounds
116.1m).
Earnings per share increased from 4.43p to 5.04p and a recommended final
dividend of 1.567p makes a 2.4p (2p) total.
The group is paying Pounds 10.5m cash for the hamper business of Heritage
Food Group (UK), a privately owned Middlesbrough company. It is acquiring no
net tangible assets; the consideration represents goodwill in the form of
agent and customer lists, and hamper orders.
Pre-tax profits from the Heritage hamper business, which has 12,000 agents,
were Pounds 500,000 last year. The acquisition takes the total number of
hamper agents at Park to 90,000.
Park claims to have 40 per cent of the hamper business, which supplies boxes
of groceries to lower income groups at Christmas. The average spend per
customer last year was up 11.9 per cent at Pounds 169, and growth is
expected to continue.
Customers start paying for the hampers 45 weeks in advance, giving the group
a strong cashflow and high interest payments. However, lower rates led to a
decline in interest receivable last year from Pounds 2.53m to Pounds 2.02m.
Mr Clifford Finch, operations director, outlined the group's planned move
into high technology food processing, entitled Project Q, on which it spent
Pounds 4m last year.
A factory is being built to apply a new microwave technology to break down
and restructure potatoes without the use of chemicals. This would mean that
natural flavourings could be added. Production from the new plant should
begin early next year.
COMMENT
Park has made an outstanding success of the modern form of the corner shop
Christmas club, which it strengthened further through acquisition yesterday.
There seems plenty of room for more growth. While it sells more than 1m
hampers a year, it estimates there are 13m homes in its target market. A
question mark hangs over the move into potato processing, about which the
company proved reticent yesterday. Pencilled in profits of Pounds 15.5m give
a prospective multiple of more than 20 - a good premium that leaves no room
for error in the mysterious Project Q.
