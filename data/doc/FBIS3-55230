  [Text] Russia should become a member of NATO before the 
states of Eastern Europe and Lithuania join this organization. 
This was stated by Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich 
in an interview for a RIA correspondent. He said that such a 
step will help to avoid military-political polarization in 
Europe. Kebich believes that, once Russia has joined NATO, 
Belarus may also become a member of that bloc.
