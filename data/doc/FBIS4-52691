  [Text] A draft amendment to the Insurance Business Law, 
the preparations of which the Finance Ministry has made as part 
of deregulatory steps for the financial industry, came to light 
on 9 May. The draft amendment allows insurance companies to do 
life and damage insurance business through their subsidiaries, 
and calls for creating an insurance brokerage system that the 
United Sates has strongly demanded. The draft amendment also 
stipulates the establishment of a fund assistance corporation to 
financially rescue insurance companies in trouble. These new 
measures will spur competition among life and casualty insurance 
companies, and precipitate deregulation in the life and casualty 
insurance industry which lags behind the banking and securities 
industries. The measures will also broaden the choices of 
consumers. 
  The draft amendment will be incorporated in a final report 
to 
be compiled in the near future by the legal system panel under 
the Insurance Council (an advisory body to the finance minister). 
  The Finance Ministry will flesh out the draft amendment 
after 
the council approves it. The ministry plans to submit an 
amendment bill to the Diet during its ordinary session next year 
and put the amended Insurance Business Law in force in 1996. 
The current Insurance Business Law that was enacted in 1939 
will be amended after half a century of enforcement. 
  The draft amendment allows insurance companies, banks, and 
securities companies to participate in the life and casualty 
insurance business through their subsidiaries.
