  [Text] Hangzhou, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Qiandao (Thousand 
Island) Lake in east China's Zhejiang Province has been picked 
by the United Nations environment program as a site for 
monitoring the global land ecological system. 
  This is the only site in China selected by the program, 
which 
highly appraised its geographic features and landforms. 
  The lake was formed after submerging land for the 
construction of a huge reservoir on the upper reaches of the 
Xian River. It is a favorite tourism spot, where the more than 
1,000 islands were once hilltops.
