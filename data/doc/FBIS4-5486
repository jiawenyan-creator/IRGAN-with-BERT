  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe implied Tuesday [12 April] that he might leave 
the main opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 
to run for a prime ministerial election in the Diet, an LDP 
legislator said. 
  Watanabe, head of one of the LDP's five major factions, 
showed the resolve in a meeting with a group of junior LDP Diet 
members, called the "Liberals," which is led by Seiichi Ota. In 
the meeting, Ota's group urged Watanabe to run in the prime 
ministerial election in both houses of the Diet. 
  Ota quoted Watanabe as saying, "(I) have an indomitable 
resolve." "(I) would like to form a new party to meet the 
request."
