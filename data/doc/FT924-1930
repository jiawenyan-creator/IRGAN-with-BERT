FT  16 DEC 92 / Frei seen as next Chilean president
The outcome of the Chilean presidential elections in December 1993 was
effectively settled this week with the announcement that Senator Eduardo
Frei would be the Christian Democrat candidate, writes Leslie Crawford in
Santiago.
Given the Christian Democrats' dominance of the ruling centre-left coalition
and the government's sustained popularity, Mr Frei is almost certain to
become Chile's next president. Opinion polls out this week show Mr Frei well
ahead of other presidential hopefuls.
