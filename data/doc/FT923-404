FT  29 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Dutch share in HKDollars 821m land
reclamation contract
A SINO-British row over how to finance a USDollars 22.5bn (Pounds 13bn)
airport in Hong Kong has not stopped the colony awarding another contract
for HKDollars 821m (Pounds 62m) in land reclamation, Reuter reports from
Hong Kong.
The contract, awarded to a consortium of Hong Kong, Dutch and Italian
companies puts into place one of 10 'core' projects in the controversial
airport development. The consortium comprises Hong Kong's Universal
Dockyard, Blankevoort International Dredging of the Netherlands and Dragomar
of Italy.
The deal, to reclaim 68 hectares on the West Kowloon waterfront, brings to
16 the contracts let to date, totalling HKDollars 17.13bn. The reclamation
is set to carry crucial highway and railway links to the airport the
government is trying to build on Chek Lap Kok island in Hong Kong harbour.
Mr Rafael Hui, projects co-ordination director, said the second-lowest bid
was selected after the lowest was ruled unacceptable. Work on the 32-month
reclamation contract begins next month.
