 



Gouania vitifolia

 was first collected on dry hills in the district of Waianai [Waianae] during the U.S. Exploring Expedition in 1840.
Asa Gray was given the task of preparing a report on all of the foreign plants collected by the expedition. Of the two
volumes he produced concerning these specimens, only one was published, and in it 

G. vitifolia

 was described as a new species (Gray 1854). The species epithet was derived from the Latin 

vitis

, a vine or grapevine, and 

folium

, leaf, as the toothed leaves of this species resemble those of the grape. The Maui Island population of this species,
first collected above Lahaina on West Maui by Edward F. Bishop, probably in the 1870s, was described and named 

G. bishopii

 in honor of its discoverer by William Hillebrand (1888). In his monograph of the genus, St. John (1969) described 

G. hawaiiensis

 as a new species based upon a collection made in the Kau District of Hawaii Island in 1853 by Jules Remy. Both of these
taxa are currently considered synonyms of 

G. vitifolia

 (Wagner 

et al.

 1990). 


Gouania vitifolia

, a member of the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae), is a climbing shrub or woody vine with tendrils. Leaves are papery
in texture with a moderate to dense covering of short, soft hairs on both surfaces. The leaves are elliptic to broadly
oval in outline with toothed or lobed margins and 1.2 to 3.2 in. (3 to 8 cm) long by 0.8 to 1.9 in. (2 to 4.8 cm) wide. Flowers
are arranged in axillary spikes 0.3 to 2.8 in. (0.8 to 7 cm) long. The flowers are small with sepals and petals ranging
from 0.03 to 0.04 in. (0.7 to 1.1 mm) in length. Both the sepals and petals are white. The 2- or 3-winged fruit are about
0.4 in. (9 to 10 mm) long. Seeds are oval, glossy, dark brown, and about 0.1 to 0.2 in. (3.4 to 5 mm) long. This species is
the only Hawaiian member of the genus with tendrils and toothed leaf margins (St. John 1969, Wagner 

et al.

 1990). 
Historically, 

G. vitifolia

 was known from West Maui, the Kau District of the island of Hawaii, and the northwestern portion of the Waianae Mountains
in Makaleha, Keaau, and Waianae Kai Valleys (Degener and Greenwell 1947, HHP 1992c1 to 1992c5, St John 1969, Wagner


et al.

 1990). A single population of five individuals was discovered in 1990 on the slopes of Waianae Kai Ridge on State-owned
land (Anon. 1991, HHP 1992c5). The five plants are close to one another, growing in a single patch in a forest of mostly
naturalized, non-native taxa (HHP 1992c5), and may represent clones of a single individual (Joel Lau, HHP, pers.
comm., 1992). A second, smaller patch was discovered near the first, and probably represents a second clone. Information
is scant, but data from herbarium labels indicate that 

G. vitifolia

 prefers dry, rocky ridges and slopes in dry shrubland or dry to mesic forests at an elevation of about 2,000 ft (610 m).
Associated taxa include strawberry guava, kukui, Christmas berry, huehue haole, and mamaki (HHP 1992c5). The major
threats to 

G. vitifolia

 are competition from alien plant taxa such as strawberry guava and Christmas berry, habitat destruction by feral
pigs, and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of extant individuals,
all of which may be genetically identical (HHP 1992c5). 


Previous Federal Action 


Federal action on these plants began as a result of section 12 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq

.), which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered,
threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated as House Document No. 9451, was presented
to Congress on January 9, 1975. 

Diellia unisora

 was considered threatened and 

Gouania vitifolia

 was considered extinct in that document. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section
4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant species named therein. As a
result of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant
species. 

Gouania vitifolia

 was considered endangered in the proposed rule, but 

D. unisora

, as a threatened species, was not included. The list of 1,700 plant species was assembled on the basis of comments and
data received by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response to House Document No. 9451 and the
July 1, 1975, 

Federal Register

 publication. 
General comments received in response to the 1976 proposal are summarized in an April 26, 1978, 

Federal Register

 publication (43 FR 17909). In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn.
A 1-year grace period was given to proposals already over 2 years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a
notice in the 

Federal Register

 (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, along with four other
proposals that had expired. The Service published updated notices of review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR
82479), September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), and February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6183). 

Gouania vitifolia

 was included as a Category 1* species on all three notices of review. Category 1* species are those for which the Service
has on file substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats in the recent past, but which may have
already become extinct. Because a population of 

G. vitifolia

 was discovered in 1990, it is considered herein for listing. 

Diellia unisora

 was considered a Category 1 species on the 1980 and 1985 notices, but was changed to a Category 1* species on the 1990
notice. Category 1 species are those for which the Service has on file substantial information on biological vulnerability
and threats to support preparation of listing proposals. 

Cyanea grimesiana

 ssp. 

obatae

 first appeared on the 1990 notice, as a category 2 species. Category 2 species are those for which there is some evidence
of vulnerability, but for which there are not enough data to support listing proposals at the time. Additional recently
acquired biological information supports listing of 

C. grimesiana

 ssp. 

obatae

. The September 30, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 51143) notice of review indicated all three of these species were proposed for listing.
