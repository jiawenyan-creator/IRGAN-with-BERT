  [Text] Australia's foreign affairs minister, Gareth Evans, 
has reportedly been delayed in the southern Chinese city of 
Guilin because of aircraft problems. Senator Evans was due to 
arrive in Beijing yesterday for several top level meetings with 
the Chinese leadership. But a spokeswoman for the Australian 
Embassy said the minister would probably arrive later today. 
She said the meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, 
has been rescheduled. Senator Evans was to meet China's premier, 
Li Peng, and Trade Minister Madam Wu Yi tomorrow and those 
meetings are likely to go ahead as planned. 
  Before leaving Australia, Senator Evans said he would raise 
the issue of North Korea and human rights concerns during his 
talks in Beijing.
