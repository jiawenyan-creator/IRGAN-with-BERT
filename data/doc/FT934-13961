FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Moody's puts Nissan on downgrade
review
MOODY'S, the US credit rating agency, is reviewing the ratings of Nissan
Motor and its subsidiaries for possible downgrade, affecting about Dollars
9.1bn of securities. The Japanese car company's long-term debt is currently
rated A2 and its commercial paper is rated Prime-A.
The announcement came as Nissan reported a 9 per cent fall in domestic sales
for September, which was its third consecutive year-on-year decline, and a
26 per cent fall in exports in the first half of the fiscal year to
September.
Domestic production also declined 13 per cent in the first half, also a
third consecutive year-on-year decline, partly due to an increase in
overseas production of 22 per cent.
Moody's said that its review would focus on Nissan's ability to respond to
the challenges posed by weakening demand in Japan and on the outlook for new
model introductions by the company. The review will also examine the impact
of the yen's appreciation on profitability in overseas markets and Nissan's
efforts to cut costs and improve efficiency.
Separately, Nissan announced that it is setting up a US logistics company to
handle logistics operations for US-made vehicle parts that are exported to
Nissan factories in Japan and Mexico.
The new facility is scheduled to start operations next April to manage the
procurement of car parts by Nissan in the US.
