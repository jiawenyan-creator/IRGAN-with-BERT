FT  16 JUL 92 / Industrial output in US falls 0.3%
US industrial production fell 0.3 per cent in June, the first decline in
five months, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday.
Although most of the fall was attributed to a two-day rail strike which led
to a drop in coal mining, other key sectors were also lagging.
The output of consumer goods fell 0.4 per cent with cuts in car and truck
assemblies accounting for about half the total loss.
Production of appliances and furniture continued to improve - a sign of the
boost given to housing with lower interest rates - but the output of many
non-durables, including food and clothing, also declined.
The Industrial Production Index had been rising about 0.5 per cent for each
of the preceding four months.
Although analysts had been expecting a June decline in industrial
production, the fall underlined the frailty of the economy and bolstered
fears that the recovery might stall or fall into a 'triple-dip' recession.
Unemployment, now at 7.8 per cent, is unlikely to show much early
improvement, with large numbers of projected lay-offs being announced by the
week.
Industrial capacity utilisation in June fell 0.4 percentage points to 78.5
per cent.
Other reports have indicated similarly lacklustre economic performance,
despite sharp reductions in interest rates. On Tuesday, the Commerce
Department said retail sales went up just 0.5 per cent in June after a 0.4
per cent gain in May.
For the second quarter as a whole, production grew at an annual rate of 4.5
per cent, in contrast to the opening period when it shrank by 2.9 per cent.
