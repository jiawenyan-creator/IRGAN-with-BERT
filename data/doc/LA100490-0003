FEINSTEIN, WILSON CAMPAIGNS FOR GOVERNORSHIP 
Bill Stall's comprehensive article on Wilson, (Sept. 24) omitted mentioning a 
timely vote by the senator a few years ago when, following an appendectomy 
operation, he was brought by ambulance from the hospital and into the Senate 
chamber on a gurney in order to provide the deciding vote against an increase 
in Social Security allowances for the elderly.
