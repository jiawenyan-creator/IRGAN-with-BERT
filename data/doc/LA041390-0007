HOSTAGES 
We hereby express our appreciation of a most humane article "The Forgotten 
Hostages: Lebanese" (Part A, April 2). The perceptive writer, Marilyn Raschka, 
has dealt with a thorny subject that is much ignored by the international as 
well as Lebanese media. 
Indeed, in the general anarchy, thousands of innocent Lebanese citizens have 
been abducted not only because of their religion, but also because of their 
courage to speak their minds, their peacemaking efforts or their prominence in 
the community. 
One of the forgotten hostages is our father, Sarkis Zeitlian, a Lebanese 
editor-in-chief of Armenian origin who was kidnaped on his way to work on March 
28, 1985, at a time when many Lebanese and foreign journalists and media 
persons disappeared. 
In our ordeal we are comforted to know that there are still people who care to 
remember the forgotten hostages and the anguish of their families.
