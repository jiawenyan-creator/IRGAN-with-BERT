FT  18 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation fears cloud
prospects for equities
Wall Street
US SHARE prices finished mostly flat in moderate trading yesterday as
sentiment was dampened by concern about inflation, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 6.92 up at 3,449.93 and the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 was 0.81 firmer at 440.37, but declines led advances by 1,078
to 839 on the New York SE after volume of 227.6m shares. The Nasdaq
composite gained 1.59 at 677.96.
Following last week's worryingly strong April consumer and producer prices
data, the markets' focus of attention has shifted to bond yields, inflation
and monetary policy. Bond yields have risen considerably in the last few
days on the inflation fears, and speculation has intensified that the poor
inflation news has killed any chance of another easing of monetary policy by
the Federal Reserve.
Even worse, concern is growing that, if inflation continues its upward climb
over the next few months, the Fed may be forced to raise interest rates to
slow the pace of economic activity. Such a move would be bad for bonds, and
for equities, which have been helped hugely by extremely low domestic
interest rates.
These concerns cast a cloud over trading yesterday, subduing interest in
stocks generally. Volume was relatively light throughout the day, and prices
rarely moved from their opening levels. Otherwise, the main focus of
attention was on individual sectors.
Drug shares, which have fluctuated wildly in recent weeks, enjoyed an upturn
yesterday, buoyed by reports that President Clinton's healthcare reform team
will recommend that the government set guidelines for drug prices, and not
legally binding price controls.
The reports lifted the entire sector. Pfizer appreciated Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 71 5/8 , Merck Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 38 5/8 , Schering-Plough
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 66 3/8 and Johnson &amp; Johnson Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 43 3/4 , all in active trading.
Time Warner moved ahead Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 35 in volume of 5.9m shares
after the company announced an agreement with US West in which the regional
telecommunications group will buy 25 per cent of Time Warner's cable and
entertainment operations for Dollars 2.5bn. US West was steady at Dollars 41
1/8 .
Airline issues took another hammering amid fresh concern about the effect on
industry earnings of the latest air fare war. Delta declined Dollars 1 to
Dollars 58 3/8 .
Rank Xerox fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 72 1/4 after warning that sales in
its core document processing business would be weak in the second quarter.
Kmart slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 22 1/2 on disappointing first-quarter
operating earnings.

TORONTO closed softer but above the day's worst as retreating gold issues
and the looming Ontario budget, scheduled to be revealed tomorrow, took the
steam out of recent gains. The TSE 300 index ended 20.8 off at 3,792.5 and
falls outpaced rises by 358 to 311 after reduced volume of 51m shares.
Bombardier, CDollars  5/8 easier at CDollars 10 7/8 , said it is preparing a
claim of about CDollars 450m relating to cost overruns incurred to complete
its Eurotunnel shuttle-train cars contract. It intends to pursue the claim
in court if a settlement is not reached by this summer.
