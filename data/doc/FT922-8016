FT  15 MAY 92 / Letter: Auditors: questions of responsibility and of cost
(2)
Sir, For the enlightenment of the outgoing president of the Chartered
Association of Certified Accountants ('Move to cut audits attacked', May 8),
the cost of an audit is a regressive 'tax' on small businesses.
With 78 per cent of all UK companies having an annual turnover of less than
Pounds 100,000 (only 2 per cent with a turnover of more than Pounds 1m and 1
per cent more than Pounds 10m) most businesses are very small.
The business development unit of Manchester Business School has produced
figures from which it can be shown that the cost to a company with a
turnover of Pounds 20,000-Pounds 50,000 is between 5.5 and 2.2 per cent of
turnover, while for a company with Pounds 1.5m-Pounds 2m turnover it is only
0.3 to 0.2 per cent, a difference of 25 times at the two extremes.
When a business is wholly-owned by husband/wife the additional cost of an
audit over and above the accountancy fees is obtrusive and worthless. It is
also an unnecessary extra cost and the sooner it is scrapped the better.
