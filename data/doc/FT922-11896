FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Total takes control of Portugal
refiner
THE Portuguese government yesterday accepted a bid from a consortium led by
Total, the French state-controlled oil group, for control of the Petrogal
oil refiner, the state-owned oil refining company.
It is the largest in Portugal's three-year-old privatisation programme. The
bid values Petrogal, the country's largest company, at Es131bn (Dollars
916m).
The Total consortium was the only bidder, after Du Pont, the US chemicals
giant, dropped out of the race.
Petrogal holds more than half of the Portuguese market for refined products.
Its refining capacity of 290,000 barrels a day represents 20 per cent of the
combined capacity of Spain and Portugal, both of which are showing rapid
growth in demand for oil products, according to Total.
Total, with nine Portuguese financial investors, is to take a 51 per cent
stake in Petrogal; 25 per cent initially plus 26 per cent in the next three
years. Of the first tranche, 20 per cent will come from an issue of new
shares, expected to raise around Es20bn, with the remaining 5 per cent to
come from the sale of existing shares.
Petrogal's refineries were well-adapted for exports to Spain, Africa and
America, said the French group yesterday. The stake would give Total a sound
base to develop sales to Portuguese-speaking African countries such as
Mozambique and Angola, with which Petrogal has special relationships. This
also adds southern European exposure to Total's refining businesses, which
until now have been centred on north-western Europe.
Total has 48 per cent of the consortium and would accordingly contribute
'significantly' to the management of Petrogal, said the French group.
One condition of the sale is that Petrogal's new owners must modernise one
of its three refineries, at Sines, on Portugal's southern Atlantic coast, a
job expected to cost about Es60bn.
