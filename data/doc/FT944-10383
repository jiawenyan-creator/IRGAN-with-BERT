FT  10 NOV 94 / Iranian jets raid Kurds in Iraq
Iran said its fighter aircraft had raided guerrilla bases in Iraq yesterday.
An Iranian Kurdish rebel party said one of its camps inside a western no-fly
zone in Iraqi Kurdistan was pounded by Iranian jets. Four Iranian fighters
'severely bombarded' a base of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan in
Koi Sanjaq, 60km from the border, killing a woman resident of the town and
wounding three people, the party said in a statement. On Sunday Iran fired
at least three Scud missiles at the main base of the Mujahideen Khalq
opposition group 80km inside Iraq.
