  [Text] The TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] 
Council of Ministers convened under President Rauf Denktas at 
1600 today in a meeting that lasted nearly two hours. In a 
statement after the meeting, Denktas said that he will meet 
Gustav Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special 
representative, at a luncheon tomorrow. He also said that he 
will inform the Council of Ministers on the outcome of his 
talks. Denktas asserted: 
  [Begin Denktas recording] I will inform the Council of 
Ministers on the outcome of the talks I will have with Mr. 
Feissel. Meanwhile, the political party leaders may be satisfied 
with the outcome. We may find an opportunity to decide what we 
shall do. [end recording] 
  President Denktas also replied to correspondents' questions. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Will you 
submit a new proposal? 
  [Denktas] No, I will not. However, several questions remain 
unanswered. We shall ask that they be answered so we can 
complete our assessment. 
  [Correspondent] Will Feissel hold talks with the Greek 
Cypriot leaders after he meets with you? Will he then come back 
to brief you? 
  [Denktas] No. I am not aware of what Feissel plans to do. 
We shall not have any surprises for him. He is aware of the 
issues. However, we have to discuss them in detail. 
  [Correspondent] Can you comment on the unanswered questions? 
  [Denktas] Actually, they have been answered. However, they 
are still vague. We want to have them clarified. 
  [Correspondent] Will the government's representatives, 
particularly Prime Minister Hakki Atun and Deputy Prime Minister 
Ozker Ozgur, attend your meeting with Feissel? 
  [Denktas] Yes, they will attend. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, are the vague issues related 
to the airports to which the Turkish Cypriot passenger aircraft 
will be allowed to fly and the passports the Turkish Cypriots 
will use when they travel abroad? 
  [Denktas] Statements have been made to the effect that we 
received many things at the Vienna talks and that progress has 
been made. Meanwhile, we have been informed that certain issues 
can be resolved. After studying the documents, we have come up 
with several questions on those matters. Therefore, we shall 
try to clarify them. 
  [Correspondent] Would the Turkish Cypriot side decide to 
give 
a definite reply if Feissel maintains a positive approach at the 
luncheon? 
  [Denktas] Well, I hope so. [end recording]
