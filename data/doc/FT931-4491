FT  10 MAR 93 / Krupp steel plant closure sparks protest
KRUPP Stahl yesterday announced it will close an entire steel mill in
Rheinhausen, in the heart of the Ruhr region, making the mill the first
casualty of the German steel crisis.
The closure, which will take place in the second half of the year, will
involve the loss of 2,000 jobs. Steel production will be partially
transferred to the company's mills in Dortmund, also in the midst of
restructuring. The company also announced a further 2,500 jobs will be cut
there.
News of the closure of the 100-year-old plant in Rheinhausen immediately
sparked protest among steel workers.
'We had to decide with a grieving heart to concentrate our steel production
in Dortmund,' Mr Jurgen Harnisch, chairman of Krupp Stahl, told protesters
yesterday. The production concentration at Dortmund should improve company
results by DM250m (Pounds 106m), in addition to savings of up to DM300m
coming from the merger of Krupp and Hoesch, he said.
Rheinhausen was the site of a fierce battle against closure when steel
workers took to the streets in 1988 and won a reprieve. More than 10,000
workers demonstrated again last month after Krupp Stahl announced it was
considering closing at least one integrated steel plant.
In contrast, survival chances improved at the company's Siegen and Hagen
plants, making steel products. Mr Harnisch said yesterday he was considering
a mini-mill concept to reorganise its special steel production. The move
could save an estimated 1,500 jobs for the 4,000 workers currently employed
at the plant. 'We think this could be a workable concept' he told the
Rheinfalenpost, a regional paper.
The newspaper also cited officials at Krupp Stahl saying prospects for
co-operation talks between their company and Thyssen Stahl and Saarstahl,
the largest and sixth largest German steel producers, were 'very bad'.
Brussels forecasts that European steelmakers will have to cut capacity by
30m tonnes, threatening up to 100,000 jobs.
