FT  27 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Base metal prices still
range-bound - Market Report
London Metal Exchange trading saw all base metals prices hold in their
recent ranges, although COPPER and ALUMINIUM drifted from earlier highs.
Dealers said copper was supported early on by light Chinese interest and a
fall in LME warehouse stocks. The three months price reached Dollars 1,922 a
tonne but drifted under commission house liquidation and speculative selling
to settle at Dollars 1,914, down Dollars 11 from Monday.
Emerging physical interest and speculative buying stemmed a break below
Dollars 1,280 a tonne for three months aluminium, following earlier Japanese
selling.
PRECIOUS METAL markets maintained their early firmer tone, but activity was
fairly thin as dealers continued to focus on the tension surrounding South
Africa's elections.
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures failed to build on recent gains and
closed with moderate losses, although traders said the overall trend
remained bullish.
COCOA futures succumbed to further trade and investment fund selling.
