FT  28 JUL 93 / Councils attack urban agency plan
THE CREATION of the Urban Regeneration Agency to take responsibility for
bringing derelict land into use reflects 'a continued stagnation in
government thinking on urban policy', a report by the Docklands Consultative
Committee says.
The committee, an association of east London local authorities, criticises
the agency's emphasis on property development schemes and its reliance on
the 'trickle down' of benefits to the community.
