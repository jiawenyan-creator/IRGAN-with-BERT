GREENSPAN NOT WORRIED ABOUT RISE IN PRICES 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that while he was surprised 
by certain aspects of January's sharp jump in consumer prices, he was not 
worried that inflationary pressures are accelerating. 
Greenspan, appearing to present the central bank's semiannual report to 
Congress, was questioned at length about his views on inflation in light of 
Wednesday's government report that consumer prices shot up by 1.1% in January, 
the biggest monthly increase in seven years. 
The January increase translated into an annual rate of 14.1%. 
Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, 
asked Greenspan whether such a sharp jump in prices would force the Fed to 
change its new forecast that consumer prices will rise by between 4% and 4.5% 
this year, slightly lower than last year's 4.6% increase. 
Greenspan said that he felt comfortable with the Fed's forecast although he 
conceded that some of the specific components of the January price surge were 
surprising. 
"As best as we can judge, while the rate of inflation is higher than we would 
like, there is no evidence that it is accelerating," Greenspan said. "While I 
did not like the statistic published (Wednesday), it did not give me any great 
concern." 
In his prepared testimony, Greenspan repeated comments he made Tuesday that he 
believed a reversal in the sharp January jump in prices is under way. He cited 
evidence showing that price increases in the last half of 1989 were 
"appreciably lower" than in the first six months of the year. 
Greenspan said the Fed expects the economy to be sluggish this year, growing at 
an anemic rate of 1.75% to 2%. That would be the weakest performance since 1984 
and far below the Administration's expectations for the year.
