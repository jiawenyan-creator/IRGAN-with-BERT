IZVESTIA BECOMES CANADA'S RICHEST THOROUGHBRED 
Izvestia, ridden by Don Seymour, beat Baron de Vauz by 3 1/2 lengths to win the 
Molson Million at Woodbine Sunday and became Canada's leading money-winning 
thoroughbred. 
The 3-year-old gray colt, winner of Canada's triple crown this year, won 
$600,000 and increased his earnings to $2,368,047. Izvestia's stablemate, 1989 
Canadian triple crown winner With Approval, had been the leader with 
$2,341,540. 
Izvestia stalked the leaders down the backstretch, then burst to the front on 
the far turn for his ninth victory in 11 career starts. He went 1 1/4 miles in 
2:01 3/5.
