  [Text] Moscow, 15 Apr -- Russia must not join the Council 
of Europe, and it has no need to cooperate with NATO. This was 
the theme of a news conference given today by Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
[LDPR], in the State Duma. In a 40-minute address, he summed up 
his impressions of his trip to Strasbourg as a member of a 
Russian parliamentary delegation. 
  In the presence of a host of media representatives, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy lashed out at the West without being too fussy over 
his language. If Russia joined the Council of Europe, "a 
struggle will be waged against us for our money," the LDPR 
leader claimed. Nor should Russia, in his view, cooperate with 
NATO. "We are glad that the country's political leadership has 
taken a correct step in that direction. We support the 
president's decision not to sign the `Partnership for Peace' 
program," he declared. 
  Speaking in his usual manner, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy vented 
his wrath on "the Zionists and Americans." The French came in 
for some of his anger too for not having allowed him to travel 
outside Strasbourg. So did the Turks, "who hate all Slavs," and 
also the British, who "plundered the world first of all, yet 
have now become conservative, protecting their plunder, and have 
foisted their language on the whole world." 
  Apart from the Third World War, which has, he claimed, 
already begun in Yugoslavia, the LDPR leader also predicted an 
imminent civil war in Russia, of which "those who are running 
the country today will be guilty."
