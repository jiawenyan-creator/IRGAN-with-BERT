FT  13 JAN 93 / French inflation rate falls to 2%
FRANCE'S inflation rate fell to 2 per cent last year, the lowest rate of
price increase for 36 years, and well below the forecasts made by the
government.
Insee, the state statistics agency, said yesterday the improvement, which
compares with inflation of 3.1 per cent in 1991, leaves the French rate 1.8
percentage points below Germany's. This is the biggest inflation rate
advantage over Germany since the 1940s and leaves France with one of the
lowest inflation rates of countries in the European monetary system. This
will reinforce the French government's view that there is no economic reason
to devalue the franc against the D-Mark.
Prices were stable in December for the second month running, as a fall in
food and oil prices was wiped out by higher costs in other sectors.
Economic analysts yesterday predicted that monthly inflation would pick up
again to stabilise at around 2 per cent a year for the rest of this year.
Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, said hourly wages grew by 1.5 per cent in
real terms last year, thanks to low consumer price inflation, representing
the biggest rise in purchasing power since 1982. Including bonuses, real
wages grew by 3.5 per cent last year.
Earlier, the government confirmed that rising unemployment payments and
falling tax revenues would cost an additional FFr20bn (Pounds 2.43bn) in the
social security budget. This brings to FFr36bn the amount of extra budget
spending announced, increasing the likelihood that France will overshoot its
FFr165bn budget deficit target for 1993.
Paribas, the French investment bank, forecasts a conservative FFr270bn
deficit this year, equivalent to 3.7 per cent of gross domestic product,
while Mr Edouard Balladur, former RPR finance minister who has emerged as
the Gaulists' leading policy spokesman, fears it could rise above FFr300bn.
