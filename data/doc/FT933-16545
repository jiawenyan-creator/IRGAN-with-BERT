FT  02 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Mexican stocks recover
MEXICAN stocks recovered after opening sharply weaker on fears that a US
court ruling could delay the implementation of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, agencies report from Mexico City.
The 38-share IPC index was finally quoted up 1.46 points at 1,671.75
compared with1,795.44 at the end of 1992. The volume yesterday was 142m
shares of which 55m corresponded to public offerings.
The IPC index had fallen on Wednesday and then again in early trading
yesterday after a US federal judge had ruled Wednesday that the US Trade
Representative's Office must prepare an environmental impact statement on
the Nafta before its implementation.
Stocks showed remarkable resilience yesterday to settle mainly flat despite
the US judgement ruling Wednesday that many feared had sounded the death
knell for the accord on which Mexico sets such store.
'That's not how the market sees it,' said one Mexican floor trader. He said
reports from Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and Salomon Bros. Inc, saying the NAFTA
should be in place by the Jan. 1 deadline reassured investors looking for an
opportunity to cover short.
In spite of the apparent setback US, Mexican and Canadian officials
commented that they believed that the deadline of January 1, 1994 for
implementation of the agreement could still be met.
