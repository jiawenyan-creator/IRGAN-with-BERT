FT  22 JUN 93 / Observer: Grave job
Searching for business beyond the grave seems a rather desperate measure
even for Britain's job-hungry accountancy firms. But that is the effect of a
dusty clause in the occupational pension schemes (auditors) act which has
just landed on Observer's desk.
Whenever the last remaining or only appointed auditor meets one of three
criteria before completing the annual audit, 'the appointing body shall . .
. reappoint him with his consent . . . as soon as reasonably practicable',
the law reads. Those three criteria are removal, resignation, or death.
Government officials apparently refused to amend the law even when the need
for ouija boards was pointed out. Presumably they do not mind a long wait.
