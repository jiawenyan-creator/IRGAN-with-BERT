FT  30 JUL 93 / Balladur in pledge to urban poor
PRIME Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday set in motion an ambitious plan to
eradicate squalor in bleak housing estates surrounding major French cities,
Reuter reports from Paris.
A day after a walkabout in a deprived suburb north of Paris, Mr Balladur
pledged FFr5bn (Dollars 850m) to upgrade living conditions for France's
urban poor. The funding is to be financed by an unexpected windfall from the
government's 'Balladur bond' issued earlier this month.
A further FFr9.6bn will be spent to upgrade housing, build new roads and
provide basic public services, he said.
