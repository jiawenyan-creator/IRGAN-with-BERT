FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: AMD results hit US semiconductor
sector
SHARES in US semiconductor manufacturers were dragged down yesterday after
Advanced Micro Devices' third-quarter results failed to live up to analysts'
expectations.
AMD's share price ended the day down Dollars 4 3/4 at Dollars 22. Among
other semiconductor companies, Intel lost Dollars 2 3/4 to close at Dollars
70, Motorola was down Dollars 3 3/8 at Dollars 98 1/2 and Texas Instruments
closed down Dollars 5 1/2 at Dollars 70 1/8 .
AMD's third-quarter net income rose 25 per cent to Dollars 61.3m before
preferred stock dividends, or 61 cents a share after dividend payments. In
the same period last year net income was Dollars 49.1m, or 51 cents a share
on the same basis. Revenues increased 17 per cent for the quarter, to
Dollars 418.4m from Dollars 356.7m.
Analysts had forecast third-quarter income of about 66 cents a share,
following second-quarter net earnings of 65 cents a share. AMD's share price
drop reflected 'downbeat' comments by company executives, they said.
However, Mr W. J. Sanders III, AMD chairman and chief executive, said the
company had had 'another outstanding quarter', noting that operating income
rose more than 50 per cent compared with the same period last year.
'We are on track to achieve a third consecutive year of record sales and
earnings,' said Mr Sanders.
Revenues were boosted by strong sales of AMD's latest 'clone' of the Intel
microprocessors used in personal computers. Sales of 486 microprocessors
more than offset declining sales of the older 386 microprocessor and
seasonally slow sales of most other product lines, AMD said.
AMD is involved in series of legal battles with Intel over intellectual
property rights that have cast a shadow over its success in the
microprocessor market.
Sales of flash memory chips and CMOS programmable logic products reached
record levels in the quarter, the company said.
However, Mr Sanders noted that Intel's expanding production of flash
memories, used in notebook computers, is likely to bring prices for these
devices down.
For the first nine months of 1993 the company reported revenues of Dollars
1.2bn, an increase of approximately 11 per cent over the previous year.
Net income was Dollars 187.1m before the preferred dividend, or Dollars 1.89
a share after the dividend, compared with net income of Dollars 175.4m, or
Dollars 1.84 a share, on the same basis last year.
