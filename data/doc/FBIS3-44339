  [Text] Haikou, 21 Dec (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- The Hainan 
Provincial Government recently issued a circular, abolishing 22

terminate the formulation and implementation of fees similar to 
the abolished items mentioned above. 
  The circular specified that the abolished administrative 
charges will be stopped completely as of 11 December. Those
