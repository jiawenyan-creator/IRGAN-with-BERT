FT  25 JUN 94 / Fiji to review constitution
Fiji is to set up a joint select committee to help review the country's
racially-biased constitution, writes Nikki Tait.
The constitution, introduced in 1990 after two military coups by Mr Sitiveni
Rabuka, now Fiji's prime minister, ensures that indigenous Fijians have a
majority in parliament at the expense of the large Indian population.
The government has promised to set up a commission to review the
constitution by 1997. However, Mr Rabuka's commitment to the process has
come into question recently, after the prime minister warned that another
coup could take place if Fijians continued to feel disadvantaged. His
remarks prompted Indian political leaders to boycott parliament for several
days.
The move on a joint select committee, announced yesterday, appears to be an
effort to allay these fears. One of its tasks will be to advise Fiji's
cabinet on the size and membership of the constitutional commission itself.
