FT  30 MAR 92 / International Company News: INI plunges to Pta61.26bn loss
INSTITUTO Nacional de Industria (INI), the Spanish state industrial holding,
has plunged to Pta61.26bn (Dollars 589m) pre-tax losses for 1991 from a
profit of Pta9.24bn a year earlier, hurt by dismal performances from its
steel, airline and defence companies, Reuter reports from Madrid.
Mr Javier Salas, chairman, said the Gulf war, Spain's slowed economic growth
and comparatively steep inflation and interest rates dealt a blow to several
of its key industries.
He said 1992 would see some improvement, but added that another year of
hefty losses was likely. 'It will be a bad year, but better than the
terrible year we just experienced.'
Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana, the flag carrier 99 per cent owned by INI,
chalked up a pre-tax loss of Pta54.19bn up from Pta26.11bn, in part because
of plunging airline traffic due to the Gulf war.
The airline, which includes Chile's Landeco and Venezolana Internacional de
Aviacion, hopes to raise up to Pta120bn in 1992 in new capital, currently
under review by the European Community Commission. It plans to use this to
help cover its Pta400bn fleet renovation and an investment strategy
including further acquisitions in Latin America.
The steel group Grupo Ensidesa was also one of the worst performers among
INI's 46 subsidiaries with a consolidated pre-tax loss of Pta35.59bn. In
1990, the group posted a Pta11.01bn loss.
Mr Salas pegged the company's poor results to plunging steel prices
worldwide, slowing economic growth and the difficult restructuring process
the Spanish steel sector now faces.
Construcciones Aeronauticas (Casa), the aircraft maker, posted a Pta9.74bn
loss against a Pta4.6bn loss in 1990.
The company hopes for a cash infusion of around Pta43bn to help bring it
back to profitability and position itself for a possible foreign alliance.
But Mr Salas offered a dim view of 1992 for the sector. 'It will be a bad
year for defence,' he commented.
The group's best performer was the utility Empresa Nacional de Electricidad
(Endesa). The Endesa group turned in a Pta131.74bn pre-tax profit in 1991,
up from Pta108.84bn a year earlier.
Mr Salas added that INI was considering selling part of its 75.6 per cent
holding in Endesa.
