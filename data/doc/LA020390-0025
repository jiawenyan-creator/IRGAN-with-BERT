MOTHER, NATURALLY, WAS RIGHT; 
DIET: WHAT WE EAT PROVIDES A FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST MANY CANCERS. FEAR 
NOT THE'KILLER BROCCOLI.' 
The "Revenge of the Killer Tomatoes" may sound like the name of a cult, but 
it's really a specter haunting our supermarkets today. Deadly cabbage? 
Poisonous broccoli? 
Poppycock! Sure, some naturally occurring compounds extracted from cabbage and 
broccoli cause cancer in test animals. But people do not eat these extracts 
alone. Rather, we eat whole foods that contain lots of good things that fight 
cancer -- anti-carcinogens. 
No one would dispute the fact that what our species has ingested is what we 
beget. We have been eating as long as we have been evolving. Lactose tolerance 
is greatest in people living in regions that have consumed dairy products for 
the longest time. Several million years of evolution from our omnivorous 
hominid ancestors may well have conferred upon us some resistance to 
longstanding, naturally occurring carcinogens, such as those studied in 
broccoli. We have no such genetic experience with new synthetic organic 
materials. 
What people eat provides a first line of defense against many cancers. 
Beta-carotene, the stuff that makes carrots orange and is the precursor for 
vitamin A, protects against lung cancer, caused mostly by smoking. Recent 
studies have found that smokers have lower levels of beta-carotene in their 
blood, even if their consumption is the same as a nonsmoker's, suggesting that 
smoking itself may reduce blood carotene. 
Orangeness is not the only trait of food that may protect against cancer, 
according to several recent studies. People of China's Shanxi Province who 
routinely eat garlic and onions have much lower rates of stomach cancer. In 
Hawaii, those whose diets include lots of vegetables have significantly lower 
rates of lung cancer, while in Japan green-tea drinkers have lowerstomach 
cancer rates. 
Studies with some naturally occurring compounds demonstrate the wisdom of 
eating your fruits and vegetables. Far from being a harbinger of destruction, 
broccoli contains lots of good materials, including anti-oxidant vitamins, 
fiber and a compound called phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC). It prevents the 
most toxic material ever found in tobacco smoke from attacking DNA, and can 
snuff out or reverse the growth of tumors in animals. Ellagic acid, found in 
many fruits, such as strawberries, also inhibits cancer growth by blocking 
nasty compounds within cells. 
Numerous foods and condiments inhibit the growth of tumors in animals and are 
linked with lower risks for some human cancers. Parsley, sage, rosemary and 
thyme not only made a great song, but they prevent some toxic molds from 
growing. Mice on a diet deficient in vitamin E contracted more colon tumors 
when exposed to a cancer-causing compound than did those on a diet high in this 
vitamin. Garlic and onions, turmeric (a common spice in Indian cooking), 
capsaicin (extracted from hot peppers), cumin, clove, caraway and seafood all 
contain substances shown to reduce the effect of cancer-causing agents and 
provide a number of other health benefits. 
The long list of good things in vegetables and fruit may well explain why 
vegetarians have lower overall rates of cancer. As populations change their 
eating habits to include more foods that contain anti-carcinogens, their 
patterns of cancer may change. In the United States, Britain, West Germany and 
most of the other industrialized countries, stomach cancer rates are dropping 
rapidly. This decline may reflect improved handling and preservation of food, 
reduced use of salts and year-round consumption of green and yellow vegetables 
and fruits that contain potent anti-carcinogenic compounds and fiber. 
In many industrial countries, this continuing decline in stomach cancer is 
accompanied by increases in a number of cancers not associated with cigarette 
smoking, including bone and brain cancer. From 1950 to 1986, according to the 
National Cancer Institute, new cancer cases (minus lung cancer and adjusted for 
aging of the population) rose by 27%. New cases of childhood cancer rose more 
than 20% during this same time, despite impressive improvements in treatment 
for this disease. The causes of these troubling trends are not likely to rest 
with killer broccoli and its ilk, or with major changes in our food patterns or 
changes in methods of diagnosis. Cancers that have continued to increase over 
the past two decades are likely to reflect changes in our modern life that have 
not been adequately studied or identified.
