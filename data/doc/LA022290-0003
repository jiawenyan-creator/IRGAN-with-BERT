PATRICK HENRY MCMAHON; SAILOR SAVED BY J.F.K. 
Patrick Henry McMahon, 84, the wounded sailor whom John F. Kennedy towed three

On Aug. 2, 1943, when the crew was patrolling Blackett Strait in the Solomon 
Islands, a Japanese destroyer burst out of the darkness and smashed through 
their boat, slicing it in two and instantly killing two of the 13 crewmen. 
McMahon suffered burns on his face, chest, arms and legs and couldn't swim 
because of the pain. Kennedy put him across his back and kept him there by 
clenching McMahon's life-jacket strap in his teeth. In Encinitas, Calif., on
