 

However, the trading of options on the REIT Index, including full-value and reduced-value LEAPS on the Index, raises
several concerns, namely issues related to index design, customer protection, surveillance, and market impact.
The Commission believes, for the reasons discussed below, that the CBOE has adequately addressed these concerns.




A. Index Design and Structure 



The Commission finds that the REIT Index is a narrow-based index. The REIT Index is composed of only 25 securities,
all of which are REIT stocks.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate for the CBOE to apply its rules governing narrow-based
index options to trading in the Index options.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>

</FOOTNAME>
The reduced-value REIT Index, which is composed of the same component securities as the Index, is identical to the
REIT Index, except that it is calculated by dividing the Index value by ten.

 notes 16 through 20, and accompanying text.

The Commission also finds that the large capitalizations, liquid markets, and relative weightings of the Index's
component securities significantly minimize the potential for manipulation of the Index. First, the majority of
the components that comprise the Index are actively-traded, with a mean and median average daily trading volume of
94,900 and 49,100 shares, respectively.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 Second, the market capitalizations of the securities in the Index are very large, ranging from a high of $1.1 billion
to a low of $220.2 million, as of February 14, 1994, with the mean and median being $541.9 million and $518.7 million,
respectively. Third, although the Index is only comprised of 25 component securities, no one particular security
or group of securities dominates the Index. Specifically, no individual REIT stock comprises more than 6.5 percent
of the Index's total value, and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index account for 30.2 percent
of the Index's value.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 Fourth all of the securities in the Index are eligible for standardized options trading (four of which currently underlie
exchange-listed options).
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed CBOE maintenance requirement that at least 90 percent of the weighting of the Index be comprised of securities
that are eligible for options trading will ensure that the Index is always substantially comprised of options eligible
securities. Fifth, if the CBOE increases the number of component securities to more than 33 or decreases that number
to less than 17, the CBOE will be required to seek Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act before
listing new strike price or expiration month series of REIT Index options and Index LEAPS. This will help protect against
material changes in the composition and design of the Index that might adversely affect the CBOE's obligations to
protect investors and to maintain fair and orderly markets in REIT Index options and Index LEAPS. Sixth, the CBOE will
be required to ensure that each component of the Index is subject to last sale reporting requirements in the United
States. This will further reduce the potential for manipulation of the value of the Index. Finally, the Commission
believes that the expense of attempting to manipulate the value of the REIT Index in any significant way through trading
in component REITs, coupled with existing mechanisms to monitor trading activity in those securities, as discussed
below, will help deter such illegal activity.

In addition, for the six month period prior to February 14, 1994, no component of the Index had an average daily trading
volume of less than 15,300 shares per day.


</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>

</FOOTNAME>
For an index with a significantly greater number of securities than 25 issues, the Commission might come to a different
conclusion if only a few securities accounted for a significant portion of the index's weighting. Further, if an index
contained only a few stocks, the Commission might question whether it could be traded as an index product.

B. Customer Protection



The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the
trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as REIT Index options (including full-value and reduced-value
Index LEAPS), can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading of standardized,
exchange-traded options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure, among other things, that: (1) the special
risks of options are disclosed to public customers; (2) only investors capable of evaluating and bearing the risks
of options trading are engaged in such trading; and (3) special compliance procedures are applicable to options accounts.
Accordingly, because the Index options and Index LEAPS will be subject to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized
options currently traded on the CBOE, the Commission believes that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the
protection of investors in REIT Index options and full-value and reduced-value REIT Index LEAPS.
