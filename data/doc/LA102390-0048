WEEKDAY UPDATE; 
RAIDERS; 
GOAL LINE, NOT THE 20, IS SHELL'S CONCERN 
The San Diego Chargers had five drives inside the Raiders' 20-yard line Sunday 
but came away with only nine points. 
Is it dangerous for opponents to get inside the 20 so many times? 
"It's dangerous if they get in the end zone," Coach Art Shell said. "If they 
don't get in the end zone, it's not dangerous. They got down there, and our 
defense wouldn't let them in." 
Shell on the Raiders scoring 24 points for four consecutive weeks: "If we could 
score three points and win the football game, that's all I care about," he 
said. "I don't care about statistics, I just want to win." . . . The Raiders 
are 4-0 against AFC West opponents. CHRIS DUFRESNE
