FT  22 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
TRADING in Footsie futures was vigorous after the German cut in interest
rates, whipping up the December contract to a new high with a strong premium
against cash, writes Christine Buckley.
Persistent rumours in equity derivatives that a cut in home base rates is
imminent sprang into life again after Germany's action, taking December on a
swift journey upwards. Such was the strength of the conviction that some
market watchers expected a half-point cut would be announced by the Bank of
England this morning.
The fever was further fired by strong European markets and trading was
virtually one-way traffic for all of the session after the Bundesbank's
announcement. Institutions, who have largely kept to the sidelines in recent
sessions, weighed into the action. By the close, they had helped take the
volume up to 14,869 contracts - the highest amount in recent trading.
December had opened firmly at 3,164 and charted a steady course upwards
before easing back a little by mid-morning. The German fillip gave it more
vigour and it ended on its high of the day at 3,220  - a lead of more than
20 points over the fair value premium to cash, which is about 15 points.
Volume reached in after-hours was a hefty 17,541 contracts.
Index options were active with 16,720 lots dealt out of a total traded
options volume of 37,384.
