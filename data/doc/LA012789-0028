A deepening arctic cold wave -- which has stopped the mail, prevented grocery 
deliveries and sent soldiers into retreat -- stopped oil field work, shut down 
a Hollywood crew and postponed one of Alaska's top sled dog races. "It's so 
cold up here the thermometer has run out of numbers," Willie (Bossman) Pitka, a 
Kuskokwim 300 Sled Dog Race official, said when the southwestern Alaska town of 
Kalskag hit 70 below zero. The 10th annual Kuskokwim 300, with a $50,000 purse, 
was supposed to start Thursday from Bethel. Extreme cold stopped the race 
before it could start, said Allen Auxier, race judge in Bethel.
