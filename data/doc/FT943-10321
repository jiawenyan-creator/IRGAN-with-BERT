FT  05 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Glynwed ahead 59% and sees fresh growth
Glynwed International, the diversified engineering group, lifted first half
pre-tax profits by 59 per cent as five of its six main operating divisions
showed an increase at the operating level.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 25 were Pounds 29.1m, compared
with Pounds 18.3m. Group turnover was 2.8 per cent higher at Pounds 489.6m,
but operating profits climbed 37 per cent to Pounds 32.7m (Pounds 23.9m).
'There is a lot of growth still to come. The economic background is good,'
said Mr Gareth Davies, chairman. 'There is no reason why economic growth and
Glynwed's growth should not continue.'
Promises of further growth helped to boost the shares by a further 5p to
390p yesterday, after gains each day this week.
Mr Bruce Ralph, chief executive, attributed the fact that profits grew
faster than sales to some increase in product volumes but as much to
cost-cutting and product introductions.
Earnings per share rose from 5.73p to 9.16p, but the interim dividend is
held at 4.15p. 'We will leave it to the final to make an appropriate
increase,' said Mr Davies. Payments for 1993 totalled 11.65p for the fifth
consecutive year.
Sales per employee were running at a higher level than the previous peak in
1989. The return on capital for the group rose during the first half to 24.6
per cent, against 15.5 per cent in 1993.
The problem division for Glynwed, however, is tubes and fittings where
operating losses rose from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 1.9m. The group has been
commissioning a new copper tube mill but margins have been tiny and the
divisional management is seeking cost reductions. The division will not make
a profit this year, Mr Ralph said.
The consumer products business, including Leisure sinks, Aga-Rayburn stoves
and Flavel-Leisure cookers, lifted profits by 27 per cent, while the foundry
products, metals, steel and plastics businesses were able to respond to
stronger demand.
There was a reduction of Pounds 15.6m in net borrowings to Pounds 54.2m;
gearing has fallen from 45.2 per cent to 25 per cent.
COMMENT
Glynwed is more cheerful than at any time since recession started to knock
its figures in 1989. It now has that happy combination of reduced costs,
following the rationalisation programmes of recent years, and rising
markets, especially in the UK and US, but with Europe starting to climb.
Demand for its industrial products has already risen, that for consumer
products has to follow. So it should be able to ride the economic cycle with
some panache as pre-tax profits for this year rise to about Pounds 63m,
providing earnings per share of over 20p. This puts the shares on a
prospective multiple of just over 19, and shareholders should now be able to
enjoy the ride as a recovery stock recovers.
