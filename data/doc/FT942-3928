FT  13 JUN 94 / GMB delegates pass emergency resolution
Delegates at the GMB general union conference yesterday passed an emergency
resolution calling on unions and the Trades Union Congress not to provide
platforms for Conservative politicians.
The vote was a blow to the TUC policy under Mr John Monks, general
secretary, to seek a dialogue with the government.
Mr John Edmonds, GMB general secretary, said: 'There is a feeling in our
union that the trade unions should not provide a platform anywhere for this
deadbeat, lame-duck government.'
