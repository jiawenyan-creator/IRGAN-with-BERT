Notes: Immediately upon each evidentiary filing, the filing party will place all documents relevant to the filing
(other than documents that are privileged or otherwise protected from discovery) in a depository open to all parties,
and will make its witnesses available for discovery depositions. Access to documents subject to protective order
will be appropriately restricted. Parties seeking discovery depositions may proceed by agreement. Relevant excerpts
of transcripts will be received in lieu of cross-examination at the hearing, unless cross-examination is needed
to resolve material issues of disputed fact. Discovery on responsive applications will begin immediately upon their
filing. The Administrative Law Judge assigned to this proceeding will have the authority initially to resolve any
discovery disputes. The dates for filing post-hearing briefs and for oral argument before the Commission will be
set upon completion of oral hearings.
