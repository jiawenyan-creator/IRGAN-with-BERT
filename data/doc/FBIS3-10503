  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The United States is one of the 
countries that renders more financial assistance to Bolivia, 
although part of this assistance is conditioned on results 
obtained by Bolivia in its fight against drug trafficking. 
Bolivia and the United States share bilateral interests such as 
sustainable development and environmental preservation, which 
were discussed by the two nations' vice presidents in Washington 
in December. 
  [Begin Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas recording] We 
have 
conveyed our invitation to Vice President Al Gore. I hope that 
in the near future we can have the honor of receiving the visit 
of such a distinguished personality in Bolivia. [end recording] 
  Cardenas, however, will not have to wait for Gore too long. 
On 20 March, he will visit Bolivia. 
  [Begin Cardenas recording] We want to have sustainable 
development that will respect and preserve the environment. Vice 
President Gore sympathizes very much with this yearning. [end 
recording] 
  During Gore's visit, U.S. support for overall growth 
objectives, which resulted in the establishment in Bolivia of 
the Sustainable Development Ministry, also will be discussed.
