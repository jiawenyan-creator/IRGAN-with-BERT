  [Text] In "An Opinion" column, TISHRIN says: The massacre 
at Hebron's Holy Ibrahimi Mosque was not the act of an 
individual. The Israeli Government and the Jewish settlement 
policy are fully responsible for this ugly crime, as well as all 
previous and subsequent crimes, against the Arabs. This is 
because the Israeli Government allows settlers to carry, and 
trains them on the use of arms under security pretexts. It also 
hoards them in communities inside the occupied Arab territories 
at the expense of the Arabs and their dignity, and fills them 
with hatred and rancor against the Arabs so that the settlers 
will support the Israeli Army in terrorizing the Palestinians 
and force them to leave their homes and lands. 
  TISHRIN adds: The continued occupation of the Arab 
territories and the continued presence of settlers in these 
territories will keep the situation in the region explosive. 
The crimes of settlers and the Israeli Army are the product of 
a single policy that is based on murder, terrorism, and 
expansion.
