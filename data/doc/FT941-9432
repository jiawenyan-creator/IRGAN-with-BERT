FT  15 FEB 94 / People: Rentokil phones the lawyers again
Henry King, 57, (right) who took over as chairman of City lawyers Denton
Hall in November, is following in the footsteps of one of his predecessors
and taking on the chairmanship of one of his firm's bigger clients. He will
become non-executive chairman of Rentokil, the environmental and property
services group, when David Newbigging steps down in May.
King, who joined Denton Hall in 1961 as an articled clerk, has been a
non-executive director of Rentokil since 1985. He is also a director of City
Centre Restaurants and Brambles Investments. Clive Thompson, Rentokil's
chief executive, said that the board had felt it was preferable to appoint a
chairman from one its own members rather than hire headhunters to bring in
an outsider.
King is not as well known outside the City as David Newbigging, 60, a former
chairman of Jardine Matheson, who is retiring from the Rentokil board after
seven years as chairman. However, King does know the company well. His firm
of Denton Hall &amp; Burgin acted for Rentokil when it was floated on the stock
market in 1969 and Pat Burgin, one of King's former colleagues, was chairman
at the time of flotation.
King says that the fact that Rentokil has drawn two of its chairmen from the
same law firm was a coincidence. Denton Hall is not Rentokil's sole law firm
and King says that one of his own inviolable rules is that he never gets
involved in giving legal advice to clients 'where I sit on the board'.
