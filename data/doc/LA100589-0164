LAKERS EXPECT GREEN TO MAKE CAMP OPENER 
Free-agent forward A.C. Green is expected to show up by Friday, when the Lakers 
open training camp in preparation for the National Basketball Assn. season. 
Marc Fleisher, Green's agent, said Wednesday that contract agreement is so 
close that Green is expected to fly to Hawaii perhaps in time for a team 
meeting tonight. Green is bringing a copy of the contract with him, Laker 
General Manager Jerry West said. 
The Lakers reportedly have offered Green, the club's starting power forward the 
last three seasons, a multiyear contract worth more than $1.3 million a season.
