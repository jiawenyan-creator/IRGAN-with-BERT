FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Nordbanken ends sector's season
with record loss
NORDBANKEN, the Swedish state-owned bank, ended the sector's reporting
season on a grim note yesterday when it announced a SKr16bn (Dollars 2.07bn)
operating loss for 1992, the biggest deficit ever disclosed by a Swedish
bank.
However, it said it could rebound to a break-even result this year,
following a recent financial reconstruction, provided economic conditions
for its activities did not worsen.
The 1992 result represents a sharp deterioration on Nordbanken's 1991
deficit of SKr5.8bn, and mainly reflects a sharp jump in credit losses to
SKr19.2bn, or 7.5 per cent of lending, from SKr10.5bn, or 3.9 per cent.
'The accelerating crisis in the real estate market and the recession with
its high interest rates placed exceptional pressures on the shareholders'
equity of the bank,' it stated.
The result is much worse than the SKr8.4bn deficit revealed at the
eight-month stage, as credit losses deepened by SKr9bn in the final four
months of the year because of higher interest costs and customers' foreign
exchange losses. A total of 70 per cent of its credit losses were related to
the real estate loans, and just 2 per cent to personal customers.
The bank also saw a big rise in non-performing loans and interest
deferments, which cut its result before credit losses to SKr3.18bn from
SKr4.66bn. Non-performing loans doubled from SKr19.3bn to SKr39.4bn, against
which it has made provisions of SKr22.4bn.
Net interest income fell 17 per cent to SKr7.06bn, with other operating
income unchanged at SKr3.06bn. Running costs were also virtually static at
SKr6.9bn.
The bank's net loss was cut to SKr1.89bn from SKr5.54bn thanks to a SKr10bn
capital injection from the state.
The bank said it was facing 1993 in a much stronger position following a
reconstruction which has transferred SKr50bn in problem loans to a bad bank
entity called Securum, which was taken over by the state at the start of
this year. This move has cut the bank's risk-weighted assets from SKr230bn
to SKr210bnm, while increasing its international capital adequacy ratio to
8.9 per cent.
