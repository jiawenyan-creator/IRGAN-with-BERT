FT  22 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Hitachi moves its TV projector output
south
HITACHI, the Japanese consumer electronics group, will move the annual
production of 70,000 projectors for TV sets from its plant in Anaheim,
California, to Tijuana, Mexico, by 1993.
The decision confirms Tijuana's leading position as an electronics assembly
centre, but the move may be seen by opponents of the proposed North American
Free Trade Agreement as evidence that closer economic integration with
Mexico leads to the loss of jobs in the US.
The announcement follows a similar decision last year by Zenith, the US
electronics company, to close its plant at Springfield, Missouri, employing
a workforce of about 1,000, and move it south of the border. Hitachi's
California plant has 250 employees.
Hitachi said it was closing the California plant because of lower wages in
Mexico, which put total production costs in Tijuana at about 15 per cent of
those in Anaheim.
Tijuana is already one of the world's largest centres of TV production, and
includes factories owned by Goldstar, Toshiba, Samsung, Sony, Sanyo and
Matsushita.
Mr Peter Lilley, UK trade and industry secretary, has offered Mexico's oil
sector British 'equipment, contractors and experience in deep waters', and
said he was 'certain' Mexico would reduce curbs on foreign investment in
petrochemicals soon.
Mr Lilley, on a trade mission to Mexico, stopped short of asking for the
changes in Mexico's constitution that would allow the British experience to
be fully taken advantage of.
Mexico was going to enjoy an economic miracle in the 1990s, just as Britain
had in the 1980s, he added.
