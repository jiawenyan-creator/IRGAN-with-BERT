FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: Upturn seen in US newspaper
advertising
KNIGHT-RIDDER, the US newspaper and news agency service group, is predicting
a rise of between 3.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent in total US newspaper
advertising revenues during 1993.
Mr Jerry Tilis, Knight-Ridder's vice-president for marketing, made the
forecast yesterday at a seminar in New York.
He said the that bulk of the increase would probably be the result of higher
advertising rates.
During 1993, Mr Tilis said he expected revenues from both retail and
national advertisers in the US to rise by 3 to 4 per cent. Classified
revenues could grow by 4 to 5 per cent.
Mr Tilis said the total rise in US advertising revenues for the current year
was likely to be an anaemic 0.7 per cent, with national advertising revenues
some 2 per cent better than last year and classified and retail revenues up
by 0.5 per cent.
