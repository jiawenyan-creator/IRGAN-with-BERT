FT  01 FEB 93 / Letter: Jumbo problem at airports
Sir, I wonder if the advent of the 'super jumbo' carrying up to 800
passengers ('Boeing and Airbus partners agree to super jumbo study', January
22) will mean even earlier check-in requirements and disembarkation delays
for long-haul travellers.
Is it too much to ask for a few of the several billions of dollars which
will be spent on the super jumbo to be diverted to help streamline airport
procedures, which already can mean upwards of two hours at each end of
long-haul flights, if my own experience of seven big international airports
recently is anything to go by?
