FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Groups bid for Spanish telecoms
licence
Two consortia, both predominantly backed by domestic capital and each
including foreign operators, entered their bids yesterday for Spain's second
mobile telephone licence. The licence will be awarded by the Spanish
government before the end of the year.
The competition pits the Cometa-SRM consortium, which has Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya as its biggest individual shareholder, against
Airtel-Sistelcom-Raditel backed by Banco Central Hispano and Banco
Santander.
The contest to operate a Global System for Mobiles (GSM) mobile digital
network, which will compete with one reserved for Telefonica, the
state-controlled communications group, is the first big step in a
deregulation package which, over the next three years, will introduce cable
television and end Telefonica's monopoly as a national basic telephony
operator.
'This is the most significant investment challenge in Spain to date because
it involves the break-up of voice monopoly,' said Mr Claudio Boada, managing
director in Spain of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which is
advising the transport and communications ministry.
The bid is one of the biggest domestic investment outlays on record to
capture what is regarded as a very high growth market. There are some
400,000 subscribers for Telefonica's existing analogue cellular system. Mr
Boada believes that over the next 10 years the GSM system will win a 12 per
cent market penetration in Spain and 4m subscribers.
The consortia must bid a minimum of Pta50bn (Dollars 393m) to obtain the
licence, but analysts believe the real net value of the licence could be
some Pta160bn. The winning consortium will then face an initial investment
of some Pta120bn.
Officials say the bids will begin to be reviewed next week, and the decision
will be announced by December 31.
