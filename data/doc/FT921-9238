FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: ICI Spanish paint buy
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries is buying Barnices Valentine of Barcelona,
Spain's largest manufacturer of vehicle repair paints.
ICI already owns Valentine in France and the move fills a gap in the British
group's southern European markets.
Barnices, which is privately owned, has turnover of Pounds 16m in a
fragmented niche market in which only small quantities of high-value,
specialised coatings are used. ICI, however, will now be able to add its
Autocolor products to Valentine's, usingBarnices' distribution network.
The price was not disclosed at Barnices' request, but is unlikely to be
significant. However, the acquisition is the first by ICI for more than 18
months, a period in which it has made numerous divestments.
