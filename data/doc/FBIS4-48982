  [Text] Taipei, April 30 (CNA) -- Police arrested four 
suspected drug dealers and seized 2 kilograms of heroin during a 
raid on a house in Taichung, central Taiwan, late Friday [29 
April] night. 
  The four suspects were Lin Chen-hsiung, 49; his wife Lin 
Chang Shu-mei, 44; Shieh Yu-chi, 30; and Li Ming-wei, 42. 
  The suspects had collaborated with drug dealers in Hong Kong 
and Thailand to smuggle heroin into Taiwan many times during the 
past year, the Criminal Investigation Bureau said Saturday. 
  Bureau agents began to shadow Lin and his associates last 
May. The police found the ring was headed by a Hong Kong-based 
man, known only as "Simon." Lin was responsible for drug 
distribution in Taiwan, agents said. 
  The agents found that the heroin was smuggled into Taiwan 
inside opaque bottles of alcohol. The smugglers placed small 
amounts of heroin inside the bottles and carried only two 
bottles each time through customs without incident, the agents 
said. 
  The agents said they will continue their investigation into 
the case.
