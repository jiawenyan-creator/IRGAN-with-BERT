FT  09 SEP 93 / Chambers warn of fragile recovery
THE British Chambers of Commerce last night warned that recovery of domestic
demand was fragile, and could easily be stalled by premature fiscal action.
The association urged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to give priority to
cuts in public spending over increased taxation in his November 30 Budget.
The group, which claims to represent 214,000 businesses, said 'urgent
consideration' should be given to lowering interest rates further from the
present level of 6 per cent. The chambers also advocated a 'competitive'
exchange rate for sterling to nurture recovery.
In their proposals for the Budget, the chambers also said that:
Britain should not return to the European exchange rate mechanism until
community member states had achieved a much greater degree of economic
convergence.
Serious consideration should be given to independence for the Bank of
England.
They also called for help for small businesses.
