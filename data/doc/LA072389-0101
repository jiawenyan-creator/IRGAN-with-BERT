OLD FOES ATTEND WARSAW PARADE 
Poland's new-style leadership gave an unusual look to Saturday's Communist 
National Day when newly elected President Wojciech Jaruzelski reviewed troops 
alongside a member of the once-banned Solidarity trade union. 
In a scene unthinkable even at last year's July 22 ceremony to mark the 1944 
birth of the forerunner of Poland's first Communist government, Solidarity's 
Andrzej Stelmachowski stood next to Jaruzelski on the reviewing stand. 
Jaruzelski, in his general's uniform, watched troops from a podium on central 
Warsaw's Victory Square before laying a wreath at the nearby Tomb of the 
Unknown Soldier. 
It was the Communist leader's first major public engagement as president, since 
he was elected to the post with the narrowest possible margin Wednesday in an 
uncontested vote in the National Assembly.
