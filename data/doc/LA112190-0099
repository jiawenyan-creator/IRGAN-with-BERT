HOLLYWOOD PARK; 
SCHEDULE FOR THANKSGIVING WEEK LOOKS FILLING 
Hollywood Park will celebrate the holiday week by offering four stakes, topped 
by Sunday's $500,000 Hollywood Starlet for 2-year-old fillies. 
Expected to head the field in the Grade I race are Ifyoucouldseemenow and 
Cuddles, the 1-2 finishers in the Moccasin Nov. 10. 
Gary Stevens, who fractured his right elbow last Wednesday, is hopeful he'll be 
back to ride Cuddles for trainer Wayne Lukas. 
Eleven California-breds were entered for Thanksgiving Day's $100,000 On Trust 
Handicap. Sensational Star, who was beaten as the prohibitive favorite in the 
California Cup Sprint, is likely to be the favorite in the one-mile race. 
Others scheduled to start are Kennedy's Knockout, Kept His Cool, Shirkee, Eddie 
Champion, Stylish Stud, Gum, Rocket Gibralter, On The Menu, No Commitment and 
Individualist. 
The next day, General Meeting, Cien Fuegos and Olympio, all candidates for next 
month's $1-million Hollywood Futurity, are scheduled to race in the 
seven-furlong $100,000 Hollywood Prevue Breeders' Cup Stakes. Saturday, 
sprinters will get together in the $100,000 Vernon O. Underwood race, formerly 
called the National Sprint Championship.
