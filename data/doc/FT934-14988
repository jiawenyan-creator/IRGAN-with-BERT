FT  14 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Power plant resumption in Kuwait
TYNESIDE consulting engineers Merz and McLellan are to resume work on the
2,400 MW Sabiya oil and gas fired power station in Kuwait, more than three
years after the Gulf War halted work on the project, Chris Tighe reports.
The company was awarded the station design and project management contract
in 1988, but Merz engineers were taken hostage in Kuwait at the outbreak of
the war.
The new Pounds 17.5m contract from Kuwait's Ministry of Electricity and
Water involves three years' work at Merz's Newcastle head office, and seven
years on site. Merz and McLellan also announced yesterday it had won power
station contracts worth Pounds 2.6m from Syria and Hong Kong.
