Background


The Commission instituted these investigations effective November 26, 1993, following preliminary determinations
by the Department of Commerce that imports of certain steel wire rod from Brazil and Japan were being sold at LTFV within
the meaning of section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(b)). Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigations
and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the
Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the 

Federal Register

 of December 16, 1993 (58 FR 65732). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on February 15, 1994, and all persons who
requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel.
The Commission transmitted its determinations in these investigations to the Secretary of Commerce on March 25,
1994. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2761 (March 1994), entitled ``Certain Steel
Wire Rod from Brazil and Japan: Investigations Nos. 731TA646 and 648 (Final).''



Issued: March 28, 1994.
