FT  01 MAR 93 / Surveys find signs of recovery
EVIDENCE of the first increase in manufacturing activity in eight months is
claimed by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply in its monthly
survey today.
A separate survey of consumer purchasing intentions by Verdict Research,
retail analysts, also says that its results for last month are the first to
justify optimism in an economic upturn.
The institute's survey of UK purchasing managers shows a rise in its overall
purchasing managers' index from 49.3 per cent in January to 51.2 per cent
last month. Index readings below 50 per cent suggest that the manufacturing
economy is generally declining, while readings above 50 per cent point to an
expansion.
Two components of the purchasing managers' index - the output index and new
orders index - have both stood above 50 per cent for the past four months.
The output measure rose from 50.2 per cent to 53.8 per cent between January
and February and the new orders index from 52.8 per cent to 53.9 per cent -
although in December it was 54.1 per cent.
The institute attributes the improvements to stronger demand, increased
sales and improved confidence. Devaluation continued to affect order books
as a number of companies reported an increase in overseas orders.
Verdict says the most encouraging feature of its survey - which tracks
consumers' intentions to purchase property, cars and large household items
over the next six months - is the upturn in intentions to move house. The
proportion of people interviewed who planned to move rose to 6 per cent in
February, following five consecutive months at 4 per cent. Verdict concludes
that its results 'confirm the beginnings of better times' in the housing
market.
