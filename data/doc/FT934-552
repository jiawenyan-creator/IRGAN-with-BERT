FT  24 DEC 93 / Lloyd's revises offer to Names
Lloyd's of London has revised the Pounds 900m compensation package offered
to the insurance market's loss-making Names, after discovering a calculation
error in its original offer.
The Lloyd's Names associations' working party said that the admission of the
error would further undermine the confidence of Names in the offer. It urged
Names to reject the offer, which it described as 'an act of expediency
rather than a settlement based on principle or equity'.
The revision involves the re-allocation of Pounds 22m of the total. It will
result in an increase in the offer for 13,500 Names of up to Pounds 90,000
and a reduction in the offer for 9,300 Names of up to Pounds 40,000.
Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, described the error as 'extremely
galling' but said that it should not alter the outcome.
He said: 'For the vast majority of people the scale of the mistake is small
in quantum but it does not belittle the fact that the mistake has been
made.'
The error, which involved one step of a complex, 60-step calculation,
originated from a mistake in the allocation of money between members on a
number of syndicates.
Lloyd's realised it had made an error after receiving a number of queries
from action groups and individual Names. On Thursday last week it appointed
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, to check its calculations. It
intends to send out the revised offer to Names next week.
As a result of a separate error Lloyd's is reducing the Pounds 2.5m offer
made to Wellington 406 by Pounds 500,000.
