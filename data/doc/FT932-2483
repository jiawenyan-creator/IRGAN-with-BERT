FT  18 JUN 93 / Observer: EC flagman
Will the European Commission pick an insider to replace John Drew, who has
stepped down from his job as the EC's number one flag-waver in London?
Although it is a pretty well-paid post and has a nice office, the EC's
London outpost has not done a very good job of getting its message across.
It has also been slammed for its chaotic organisation. A lot is expected of
Drew's successor.
Drew was an outsider - he was director of European affairs at Touche Ross -
and this time around there is a strong lobby in Brussels for his replacement
to be an insider - someone who knows the ropes. Jeff Martin, a breezy
Irishman who was Drew's deputy, is one possibility. But it sounds as if Sir
Leon Brittan, the senior of the two UK commissioners, wants to give the task
of refurbishing the EC's dismal image in Britain to an outsider. An ideal
job, perhaps, for an out-of-work Tory MP who has given up hope of being
re-elected?
Or even Labour's ex-leader Neil Kinnock?
