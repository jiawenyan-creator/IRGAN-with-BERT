FACES . . .: EAST MEETS EAST 
Sitarist Ravi Shankar, 68, has spent a lifetime collaborating with musicians 
from around the world, combining various traditions of music. Perhaps it is no 
surprise then, that he resists the claim that he has broken new ground in 
glasnost with his latest recording, "Inside the Kremlin." 
"There's nothing gimmicky about it," Shankar claims. "They have my records in 
the Soviet Union and I have been going there since 1953. They know my music 
very well." 
Shankar was invited by the Soviet government to participate in a yearlong 
festival in Moscow to celebrate Indian culture. A live recording of Shankar's 
contribution which was performed in Red Square last July, "Inside the Kremlin" 
melds various Russian traditions with Shankar's Indian traditions combining the 
Moscow Chamber Orchestra, the Russian Folk Ensemble, the Government Chorus of 
the Ministry of Culture and an ensemble of Indian musicians and vocalists -- 
about 140 musicians altogether. 
"I learned about Russian music listening to records of Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky 
and Rachmaninoff, and I also know the folk music through my studies on the 
balalaika," Shankar said. "The musicians had no trouble assimilating the seven 
original compositions of this project. We rehearsed about five or six days 
before the performance." 
Described as "Swar-Milan" or "meeting of musical notes," Shankar's efforts to 
combine musical traditions are not without precedence. In the past he has 
collaborated with violinist Yehudi Menuhin, koto master Susumu Miyashita and 
ex-Beatle George Harrison. 
In October, he will collaborate with the Birmingham Touring Opera of England 
with an opera, "Vision Through the Haze." Shankar plans the opera as a 
statement against drug abuse. GREGG WAGER
