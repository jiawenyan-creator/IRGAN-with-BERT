The handwriting examiner who concluded that Pete Rose's writing is on three 
betting sheets, disagrees with Rose's contention that there is no way to 
determine whether the handwriting is a forgery. 
The three sheets include an indication that bets were made on Cincinnati Reds' 
games, and were cited by baseball investigator John M. Dowd as a key piece of 
evidence that Rose had bet on the Reds. 
In Rose's authorized biography, author Roger Kahn contends there is no way to 
tell whether the printing on the three sheets is Rose's because the FBI smudged 
the sheets while testing for fingerprints. 
Richard Casey, a retired FBI handwriting expert who was hired by Dowd to study 
the sheets, disagreed. Casey studied photocopies of the sheets with a 
microscope and concluded it was Rose's writing. He said examiners often base 
conclusions on photocopies.
