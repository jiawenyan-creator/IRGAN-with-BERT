  [Text] Geneva, March 3 (XINHUA) -- A representative for 
the United Nations has sent a message of thanks to the 
International Olympic Committee [IOC] for its efforts to bring 
peace to the former Yugoslavia, according to the Laussane-based 
IOC on Thursday [3 March]. 
  Yasushi Akashi, special representative of the UN secretary- 
general for the former Yugoslavia, sent the message to IOC 
President Juan Antonio Samaranch, which reads as follows: 
  "At the end of the '94 Lillehammer Winter Olympic Games and 
as the truce in Sarajevo still holds, I would like to express my 
best wishes to you personally and to the Olympic movement. 
  "Particularly at this time, it is encouraging to have seen 
in 
Lillehammer that pride in one's national achievements can still 
co- exist with friendship and joy among nations." 
  On February 16, the IOC delegation paid one day visit of 
Sarajevo, the 1984 Winter Olympics host city which has been torn 
by the civil war.
