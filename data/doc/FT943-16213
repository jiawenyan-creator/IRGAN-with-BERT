FT  06 JUL 94 / Brussels airs pollution rules
European Union member states would get common air quality monitoring
standards and pollution limits under a draft directive approved yesterday by
the the European Commission. The draft regulation, which requires approval
by ministers, is part of a review and simplification of EU environmental
legislation for air and water standards. It has been drawn up as a result of
growing concern about air pollution in several countries, including Britain,
Belgium and Greece.
Up to 14 air pollutants would be covered by the directive, ranging from
sulphur and nitrogen dioxide to ground-level ozone and carbon monoxide. The
first three pollutants, along with lead and hydrocarbon particles, are
already covered by five EU directives, but Brussels now wants a more common
and broader approach. This would consist of: common reporting standards;
setting pollution limits to be attained within 10-15 years; and setting
provisional ceilings. When the latter are exceeded, the public should be
informed and emergency measures taken. The Commission itself would
eventually publish regular reports on Union-wide air quality. It envisages
that pollution limits for substances already covered by EU law should be set
by the end of 1996, with a deadline of the end of 1999 for the other nine
chemicals being targeted. See Editorial Comment
