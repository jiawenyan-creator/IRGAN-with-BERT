<F P=106> [Interview with Nurlan Danenov, press spokesman for the </F>
president; place and date not given: "What Happened, Happened. 
And No More Than That"] 
  [Text] N.A. Nazarbayev's press spokesman comments on 
the president's recent edicts concerning personnel shuffles in 
the upper echelons of the executive. 
  [Question] Nurlan Zhumagaliyevich, the president's speech on 
television on Tuesday was general and nonspecific. He did not 
give a single direct reason for the "departure" of important 
officials, Z. Nurkadilov included, from their posts. 
  [Danenov] These changes are occurring in the context of N.A. 
Nazarbayev's speech at the session of parliament, in which he 
spoke of the need for certain personnel adjustments. 
  [Question] Please be more specific about Nurkadilov, if you 
can. The wording "in connection with his transfer to other work" 
without an indication of what work precisely usually means that 
a person is being removed with a big demotion. 
  [Danenov] I do not yet know to what kind of work he is being 
transferred, I do not have this information. 
  [Question] What happened, why was it decided to remove the 
mayor of the capital from office? 
  [Danenov] What happened, happened, and no more than that. 
Someone else has been appointed head of the capital's 
administration, and Nurkadilov has been released. 
  [Question] Is it true that he is in hospital following a 
heart attack? 
  [Danenov] I know nothing about this. According to my 
information, Z.K. Nurkadilov is currently on vacation. 
  [Question] Nonetheless, has he made a complete mess of 
things 
or "fallen somewhat short of his target" or will he be appointed 
with honor to just as high a position? 
  [Danenov] I repeat that the measures outlined by the 
president in his speech to the deputies and his appeal to them 
are being implemented. There is a rotation of personnel and, in 
places, their rejuvenation and the replacement of people who 
have been in their positions too long. When a person has worked 
for a very long time in one position, he no longer produces the 
results that he should.
