FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Shield Group falls to Pounds 5,000
Shield Group, the estate agency, reported a fall in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 54,000 to Pounds 5,000 for the six months to September 30. Turnover
fell slightly, to Pounds 934,000 against Pounds 948,000.
Mr Norman Mazure, chairman, said the 'modest' profit was a reflection of the
cautious approach the directors had taken to the economic recovery. The
agency results had suffered, he said, because lending institutions had
disposed of a number of properties to BES funds.
Since the period end the group had diversified with the acquisition of Kamco
Computer Systems, a personal computers company.
There were losses per share of 3.2p (2.7p).
