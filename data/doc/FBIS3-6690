  [Text] French and New Zealand marines have held their first 
ever joint naval exercise south of New Caledonia. 
  The exercise, code-named "Passex", involved two of New 
Zealand's four frigates as well as the French patrol-boat "La 
Moqueuse" and the frigate "Nivoise". 
  The New Zealand navy has said that the "Rainbow Warrior" 
affair, in which the French secret services sank a Greenpeace 
ship in 1985, has been "over for a long time now."
