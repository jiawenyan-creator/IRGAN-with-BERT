  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] This morning in Athens, the 
Germans and the Belgians expressed their discontent at the 
closure of the border. Earlier we spoke by telephone with 
Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, who is currently in Athens: 
  [Begin Claes recording] I think that the Germans and the 
Belgians are on exactly the same wavelength. We appreciate that 
Greece has a problem which should not be underestimated, but we 
nevertheless think that the decisions made contravene the 
substance of the treaties which govern the European Union. 
Those decisions have to be justified to the Twelve -- not with 
the aim of making a great incident out of this, but with the aim 
of creating conditions which might allow the resumption of 
dialogue between The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
[FYROM] and Greece. [end recording] 
  On Monday [21 February], the Twelve will discuss this issue. 
In the meantime, Albania has offered its ports to FYROM, while 
Russia has offered its mediation.
