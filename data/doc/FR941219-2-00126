written disclosure of information concerning such Fund including, but not limited to: 
(1) a current prospectus for each portfolio of each of the Funds in which such Plan is considering investing, 
(2) a statement describing the fees for investment management, investment advisory, or other similar services,
any fees for secondary services (Secondary Services), as defined in paragraph (h) of section III below, and all other

a Plan may be invested in the Funds, and, if so, the nature of such limitations; and 
(5) upon request of the Second Fiduciary, a copy of the proposed exemption and/or a copy of the final exemption. 
(h) On the basis of the information described in paragraph (g) of this section II, the Second Fiduciary authorizes

to be consistent with the responsibilities, obligations, and duties imposed on fiduciaries by Part 4 of Title I of
the Act; 
(i) The authorization, described in paragraph (h) of this section II, is terminable at will by the Second Fiduciary
of a Plan, without penalty to such Plan. Such termination will be effected by the Bank selling the shares of the Fund
held by the affected Plan within one business day following receipt by the Bank, either by mail, hand delivery, facsimile,
or other available means at the option of the Second Fiduciary, of the termination form (the Termination Form), as
defined in paragraph (i) of section III below, or any other written notice of termination; provided that if, due to
circumstances beyond the control of the Bank, the sale cannot be executed within one business day, the Bank shall have
one additional business day to complete such sale; 
(j) Plans do not pay any plan-level investment management fees, investment advisory fees, or similar fees to the Bank
with respect to any of the assets of such Plans which are invested in shares of any of the Funds. This condition does not
preclude the payment of investment advisory fees or similar fees by the Funds to the Bank under the terms of an investment
advisory agreement adopted in accordance with section 15 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 or other agreement
between the Bank and the Funds; 
(k) In the event of an increase in the rate of any fees paid by the Funds to the Bank regarding any investment management
services, investment advisory services, or fees for similar services that the Bank provides to the Funds over an existing
rate for such services that had been authorized by a Second Fiduciary, in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section
II, the Bank will, at least thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation of such increase, provide a written notice
(which may take the form of a proxy statement, letter, or similar communication that is separate from the prospectus
of the Fund and which explains the nature and amount of the increase in fees) to the Second Fiduciary of each of the Plans
invested in a Fund which is increasing such fees. Such notice shall be accompanied by the Termination Form, as defined
in paragraph (i) of section III below; 
(l) In the event of an addition of a Secondary Service, as defined in paragraph (h) of section III below, provided by
the Bank to the Fund for which a fee is charged or an increase in the rate of any fee paid by the Funds to the Bank for any Secondary
Service, as defined in paragraph (h) of section III below, that results either from an increase in the rate of such fee
or from the decrease in the number or kind of services performed by the Bank for such fee over an existing rate for such
Secondary Service which had been authorized by the Second Fiduciary of a Plan, in accordance with paragraph (h) of
this section II, the Bank will at least thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation of such additional service
for which a fee is charged or fee increase, provide a written notice (which may take the form of a proxy statement, letter,
or similar communication that is separate from the prospectus of the Fund and which explains the nature and amount
of the additional service for which a fee is charged or the nature and amount of the increase in fees) to the Second Fiduciary
of each of the Plans invested in a Fund which is adding a service or increasing fees. Such notice shall be accompanied
by the Termination Form, as defined in paragraph (i) of section III below. 
(m) The Second Fiduciary is supplied with a Termination Form at the times specified in paragraphs (k), (l), and (n)
of this section II, which expressly provides an election to terminate the authorization, described above in paragraph
(h) of this section II, with instructions regarding the use of such Termination Form including statements that: 
(1) the authorization is terminable at will by any of the Plans, without penalty to such Plans. Such termination will
be effected by the Bank selling the shares of the Fund held by the Plans requesting termination within one business
day following receipt by the Bank, either by mail, hand delivery, facsimile, or other available means at the option
of the Second Fiduciary, of the Termination Form or any other written notice of termination; provided that if, due
to circumstances beyond the control of the Bank, the sale of shares of such Plans cannot be executed within one business
day, the Bank shall have one additional business day to complete such sale; and 
(2) failure by the Second Fiduciary to return the Termination Form on behalf of a Plan will be deemed to be an approval
of the additional Secondary Service for which a fee is charged or increase in the rate of any fees, if such Termination
Form is supplied pursuant to paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section II, and will result in the continuation of the authorization,
as described in paragraph (h) of this section II, of the Bank to engage in the transactions on behalf of such Plan; 
(n) The Second Fiduciary is supplied with a Termination Form, annually during the first quarter of each calendar year,
beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year that begins after the date the grant of this exemption is published
in the 

Federal Register

 and continuing for each calendar year thereafter; provided that the Termination Form need not be supplied to the Second
Fiduciary, pursuant to paragraph (n) of this section II, sooner than six months after such Termination Form is supplied
pursuant to paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section II, except to the extent required by said paragraphs (k) and (l) of
this section II to disclose an additional Secondary Service for which a fee is charged or an increase in fees;
