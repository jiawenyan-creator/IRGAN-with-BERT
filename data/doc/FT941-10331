FT  10 FEB 94 / Threat to sales of Zantac
Up to a quarter of the sales of the world's best-selling drug, Zantac, made
by Glaxo of the UK, could be at risk in the wake of a statement made by the
US National Institutes of Health yesterday.
The NIH said in a statement following a three-day medical conference that
all peptic ulcer sufferers should take antibiotics with their patent ulcer
treatments. The latter include Zantac, sales of which are worth Dollars
3.5bn a year worldwide, Losec (Dollars 1.6bn) from Astra of Sweden, and
Tagamet (Dollars 1bn) from the Anglo-US company SmithKline Beecham.
An antibiotic should help combat the bacterium Helicobacter pylori which now
appears linked to ulcers, offering, 'an opportunity to cure a disease that
before we could only treat and suppress'.
According to pharmaceuticals analysts at stockbroker Lehman Brothers up to a
quarter of Zantac sales are 'maintenance therapy', designed to prevent
relapse.
Reuter adds: A study, partially paid for by Glaxo and to be published in the
New England Journal of Medicine today, found Zantac very effective in
reducing the risk of recurrence of bleeding ulcers.
