FT  09 NOV 93 / TUC chief attacks manager 'fads'
TOO MANY British companies slavishly follow the latest management fads which
come from the US, instead of developing models appropriate to Britain,
according to Mr John Monks, general secretary of the TUC.
Speaking at the annual dinner of the Involvement and Participation
Association in London he said: 'While the United States has many good
qualities, these do not include an economy whose competitiveness is
increasing. With some spectacular exceptions the American economy has
suffered the same trends as Britain's'
He added that British and American companies used redundancy as an option of
'first resort'. A better example was set by Japan and western European
economies, which tried to use it as a last resort.
