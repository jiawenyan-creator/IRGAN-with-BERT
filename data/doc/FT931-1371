FT  25 MAR 93 / Japanese retailers report 5.4% fall in sales
JAPANESE retailers reported a 5.4 per cent fall in sales last month,
compared with a year earlier, putting added pressure on the government to
stimulate consumer spending with an income tax cut in coming months.
The Japan Chain Store Association said sales had fallen against year-earlier
levels for six consecutive months, as consumers, intimidated by the economic
downturn, have increased their savings and reduced their spending.
Car and commercial vehicle production was down 1.2 per cent to 1.043m units
in February, the fifth consecutive month of decline, the Japan Automobile
Manufacturers' Association said.
Passenger car output, excluding mini-cars, increased 1.1 per cent, but truck
production was down 8 per cent, the 19th month of year-on-year decline and a
sign of weak capital spending by Japanese companies.
The downturn in consumer confidence has prompted the ruling Liberal
Democratic party to consider ways of rekindling demand, apart from an
increase in infrastructure investment, as part of a stimulatory package
expected to be decided next month.
Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of the LDP's policy research council, wants
an initial draft of the package completed on April 5 for presentation to
opposition parties, and says the amount will exceed the Y10,700bn (Pounds
62,573m) emergency package announced last August.
The LDP is also expected to meet opposition parties on April 7 to decide on
whether an income tax cut will be necessary to ensure recovery.
Ministry of finance officials are arguing against a reduction, in the belief
that a second package alone will be sufficient to achieve a revival in the
economy.
