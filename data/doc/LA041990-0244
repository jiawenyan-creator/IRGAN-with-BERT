HURDLER GREG FOSTER SUSPENDED 3 MONTHS IN COLD MEDICINE USE 
Two-time world champion hurdler Greg Foster has been suspended from competition 
for three months for testing positive for substances commonly found in 
over-the-counter cold medications. 
The Athletics Congress said today that Foster was tested at the Sunkist 
Invitational indoor meet in Los Angeles on Jan. 19 and tested positive for 
pseudoephedrine, ephedrine and pheynylpropanolamine, substances banned by the 
International Amateur Athletic Federation. 
A three-member panel of TAC's Drug Control Review Board will hear an appeal of 
the suspension. If the appeal is denied, Foster would be ineligible to compete 
in national or international meets until June 29. 
Foster, 31, a former UCLA runner from Chino Hills won the world outdoor titles 
in the 110-meter hurdles in 1983 and 1987. 
He was the 1984 Olympic silver medalist.
