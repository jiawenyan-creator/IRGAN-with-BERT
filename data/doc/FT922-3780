FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: Pentagon lifts GE contracts ban
THE PENTAGON has lifted a ban on awarding new contracts to General
Electric's aircraft engine division, just four days after it imposed the
punishment over GE's involvement in an Israeli bribery scandal, writes our
New York staff.
The Pentagon's Defence Logistics Agency said it had lifted the ban because
of GE's rapid response to the government's concerns about the management of
the engine division, including an agreement to more government oversight of
the operations.
