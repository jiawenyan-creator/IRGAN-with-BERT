FT  16 MAR 93 / World Trade News: China's Gatt talks resume
NEGOTIATIONS on Chinese membership of Gatt resumed yesterday in Geneva, but
little progress is expected over the three days of talks following
unsuccessful discussions between China and the US earlier this month, writes
Frances Williams in Geneva.
Neither the US nor the EC has sent senior negotiators to Geneva, and part of
the US team has been delayed by severe weather. China had hoped to rejoin
Gatt this year, but US officials now say membership is a long way off.
