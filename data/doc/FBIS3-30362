  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Croatia sent a letter today to Yasushi Akashi, the UN 
secretary-general's special envoy [for Yugoslavia], protesting 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's visit to the occupied areas of the 
Republic of Croatia without permission from the Croatian 
Government. The Foreign Ministry assesses that the visit 
contravenes all relevant Security Council resolutions and 
documents which confirm the sovereignty and integrity of the 
Republic of Croatia. It will also have negative repercussions 
on the implementation of the above mentioned documents and on 
diplomatic efforts directed toward normalization of 
Croatian-Serbian relations and the peaceful reintegration of the 
occupied areas into the constitutional and legal system of the 
Republic of Croatia. This is why Mr. Akashi was asked to do 
everything within his power to prevent any future occurrence of 
such events which seriously threaten peace in this region. 
  Niko Bezmalinovic, ambassador of the Republic of Croatia to 
the Russian Federation, has sent a similar protest letter to the 
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
