  [Text] A statement issued by the Foreign Affairs Department 
in Jakarta today says that Indonesia strongly condemns the 
brutal killing of Palestinians by an Israeli in Hebron. 
Indonesia reiterates that the incident -- which killed over 52 
Palestinians and injured over 200 others -- will have a negative 
impact on the overall peace process in the Middle East. 
  The statement says the Indonesian Government and people 
offer 
their deep condolences to the Palestinian government and people 
over the incident, which took place at Ibrahim Mosque in 
al-Khalil, Hebron on Friday. Indonesia also sends its 
condolences to the families of the 10 others who were killed in 
clashes with Israeli soldiers. 
  In line with Palestinian Liberation Organization leader 
`Arafat's request for assistance from the Nonaligned Movement 
[NAM], Indonesia -- as chairman of the NAM -- will immediately 
consider the necessary moves to call an emergency meeting of the 
UN Security Council. This will show our support for the 
Palestinians.
