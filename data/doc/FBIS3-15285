  [Text] The Russian Government is not intending to cancel 
servicemen's benefits. The Finance Ministry's proposal that 
budgetary allocations for the requirements of the military 
department be reduced is an attempt to stir up the country and 
make the Government quarrel with the Army. According to RIA, 
this was stated today by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. He 
said it had been a matter of a private initiative on the part of 
the Finance Ministry. However, the prime minister noted, the 
Finance Ministry does not itself decide anything. The prime 
minister gave the assurance that the financing of the Defense 
Ministry this year will remain at last year's level. 
  As reported previously, the letter containing the Finance 
Ministry's proposals about reducing the benefits of servicemen, 
officers, generals, and military pensioners, which was sent to 
the Defense Ministry, evoked sharp dissatisfaction.
