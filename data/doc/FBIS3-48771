Chairman Tomiichi Murayama in Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] I shall make this announcement in the form of a 
chairman's statement: 
  With the agreement reached today between the ruling and 
opposition parties regarding the political reform bills -- 
excuse me, has this been passed out to everybody? Okay? -- 
prospects for the bills to be passed during the current Diet 
session have become certain. Regarding political reform, debate 
has been conducted for over five years, and two administrations 
in the past have failed to bring it about. Moreover, the issue 
has been associated with the images of various political parties 
and has had a deep impact on the very existence of Diet members 
and politicians. Thus, debates on this issue have taken a very 
difficult course. 
  Since Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Liberal 
Democratic 
Party President Yohei Kono have reached an agreement on a 
proposal presented by House of Representatives Speaker Takako 
Doi, our party will support this. I have indicated to Prime 
Minister Hosokawa that the agreement originally reached among 
the coalition parties regarding the political reform bills is 
the party's bottom line. However, we have judged that the party 
should not cause all the efforts made toward bringing about 
political reform to end up in smoke, nor shake the very 
foundations of the coalition government. Therefore, we have 
decided to accept this new agreement. We consider this a step 
forward from the existing conditions. In a continued endeavor 
toward promoting political reform in the future, we shall pour 
our utmost efforts into making up for what is lacking in the 
agreement. We ask for the understanding of the entire party, 
the people, and all our supporters. That is all.
