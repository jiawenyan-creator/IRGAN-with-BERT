FT  27 APR 94 / Mexico anti-crime drive
The Mexican government has set up a commission for public security in an
effort to tackle the growing wave of organised crime in the country.
President Carlos Salinas has named Mr Arsenio Farell, labour minister over
the past decade, to head the commission. He will co-ordinate federal and
state police, and work with the interior ministry and secretary of defence.
This follows the kidnapping of a prominent Mexican businessmen on Monday. Mr
Angel Losada Moreno, vice-chairman of Grupo Gigante, Mexico's second largest
supermarket chain, was seized from his car by six people.
The Mexican press yesterday published extracts from a letter by the
kidnappers of another prominent businessman, Mr Alfredo Harp Helu, president
of Banamex-Accival, Mexico's largest bank, who was seized last month. The
letter said a ransom of less than Dollars 100m was demanded.
The kidnappers accused the bank's principal directors of coldly trying to
sacrifice their partner by not paying.
The commission is likely to try to encourage police departments to deal with
the pervasive federal and state corruption. Kidnappers and drug
organisations in Mexico generally enjoy protection from police who are in
their pay, and are often themselves made up of ex-policemen.
