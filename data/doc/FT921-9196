FT  13 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Inquiry to delay Welsh terminal
A PUBLIC inquiry into plans by Hamilton Oil to build a gas processing plant
and oil terminal at Point of Ayr in North Wales is likely to delay the
Pounds 1bn project by at least six months.
Hamilton said this week that it was disappointed at the Welsh Office's
decision to go ahead with the inquiry and that it would be looking at
alternative sites.
Hamilton, which was acquired by Australia's BHP last year, had been looking
to start production of oil and gas from its Hamilton field, off the coast of
North Wales by late 1994. The company has a 45 per cent stake in the
project, with Lasmo holding 30 per cent and Monument Oil &amp; Gas 25 per cent.
Mr Ed Blair, Hamilton's president, says the company is now looking to the
middle of 1995 before output will begin.
The Hamilton field is estimated to contain some 750bn cubic feet of gas and
between 100m and 200m barrels of oil. Mr Blair said the field would produce
200m cu ft of gas a day - all of which has been sold to PowerGen for its
planned Connah's Quay power station. In addition, it will pump 30,000 to
50,000 barrels a day of oil.
The field will be developed with three production platforms: two for gas and
one for oil, with two pipelines taking the gas and oil onshore to the
processing plant. 'The water is relatively shallow, it's close to shore and
close to its market, which makes it fairly quick and cheap to develop,' said
Mr Blair.
The New York Mercantile Exchange plans to launch unleaded gasoline futures
within the next six months, reports Reuter from New York.
