FT  03 MAR 94 / Ruling party in Sri Lanka lead
Sri Lanka's ruling United National party gained control of 18 out of 40
urban village councils in the war-torn eastern province, in the first
elections since 1988, when Indian peace keeping troops entered the province,
writes Mervyn de Silva in Colombo.
The secessionist Tamil Tigers who claim both east and northern provinces as
their traditional homeland failed to disrupt the polls despite several raids
in remote areas.
The Moslem Congress, a new party, gained control of six councils. The main
opposition party, the SLFP, won four councils and Tamil Tiger groups won
majorities in 12 councils.
