The Emmy Awards show was full of surprises all right. While "War and 
Remembrance" won a hard-earned Emmy for best miniseries, its stars Jane Seymour 
and John Gielgud lost out to Holly Hunter of "Roe vs. Wade" and James Woods of 
"My Name Is Bill W." How could members of the TV academy overlook two of last 
year's best performances? Perhaps they have other social/political concerns in 
mind as they cast their ballots? Or maybe major "movie actors" who rarely do TV 
are favored over their TV counterparts? A word to those who deserved to win but 
did not: Don't be discouraged and keep up the good work. Incidentally, win or 
lose, Jane Seymour undoubtedly was the most beautiful woman on Emmy night.
