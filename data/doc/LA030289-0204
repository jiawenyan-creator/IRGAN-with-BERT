31 ILLEGAL ALIENS ARRESTED AT LAX AS INS BEEFS UP AIRPORT SURVEILLANCE 
Federal immigration agents arrested 31 illegal aliens at Los Angeles 
International Airport overnight, bringing to more than 200 the number of people 
nabbed in a nationwide crackdown on high-altitude "people smuggling," 
authorities said today. 
The mass arrest was the fourth this week. 
"We got 31 more heading out to various cities across the country, but we're not 
stopping there," said Ernest Gustafson, director of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service's Los Angeles District. "They (illegal aliens) can 
expect our agents out there at airports today, tonight and for the foreseeable 
future. 
"This is part of our program to monitor all flights at LAX. I understand now 
that because of that they are building up at Las Vegas and Phoenix (airports)."
