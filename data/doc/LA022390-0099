BRIEFLY 
Highest VA Mortgage Rate Goes to 10%: The Department of Veterans Affairs said 
it is raising its maximum interest rate for federally backed VA home mortgages 
to 10% from 9.5%, effective today. "The higher rate is a response to current 
demands of the financial markets for higher yields on long-term investments," 
the department said in a statement.
