THE NATION; 
ALLEGED DRUG KINGPINS SEIZED IN CAPITAL 
About two dozen people were arrested in Washington during an anti-drug sweep 
that netted the alleged leadership of a group that controlled much of the 
cocaine market in the nation's capital. Among those arrested were Rayful Edmond 
Jr., 24, and Tony Lewis, described as being in his mid-20s. Officials said the 
two operated a network that controlled up to 20% of the cocaine and crack 
traffic in Washington. The Washington Post quoted sources as saying the pair's 
alleged drug network employed more than 150 people and has been linked to 
scores of homicides. Edmond and Lewis were arrested on cocaine distribution 
charges. The arrests resulted from a two-year joint investigation conducted by 
the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI and district police. Mayor Marion 
Barry said the arrests would put "a mini-dent" in the local drug supply.
