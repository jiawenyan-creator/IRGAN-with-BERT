FT  22 FEB 94 / Singer's contract defended
Pop singer George Michael sued his record company in spite of achieving
everything possible in terms of fame, success and wealth, counsel for Sony
told the High Court yesterday.
Mr Gordon Pollock QC was making his closing submissions in Sony's defence to
the 30-year-old star's claim that his 1988 contract, which could run for
another 15 years, was a restraint of trade, financially weighted against him
and ultimately unenforceable.
Mr Pollock said that in previous litigation over restraint of trade, the
court would act in the public interest if its moral sense was outraged by
harrowing pictures of a party to a contract starving in the gutter while
society was deprived of his services.
But Mr Michael was a young man desperate for a contract by which to achieve
success, fame and fortune.
'We have a situation here where the person complaining has been wholly
successful in achieving the exploitation of his talent which it was the
purpose of the contract to achieve,' he said.
'At the same time we have not been deprived of the benefit of his talent.'
Mr Michael has claimed that Sony 'killed' Listen Without Prejudice, the 1990
follow-up to his 1988 debut solo album, Faith, to teach him a lesson when he
refused - as part of a change of artistic direction - to market it with a
video featuring himself.
After Mr Pollock's speech, which is expected to last all week, and
submissions from Mr Michael's counsel, the judge will reserve his decision.
The hearing was adjourned.
