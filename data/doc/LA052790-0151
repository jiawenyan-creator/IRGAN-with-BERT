STRIKE TALKS COLLAPSE ON EVE OF ELECTIONS 
Talks to resolve Poland's week-old railway strike collapsed, ending prospects 
for a settlement before today's local elections. Signs of an accord emerged 
briefly when workers unblocked several rail lines and strike leaders from the 
coastal city of Slupsk entered negotiations with the government. But strikers 
abandoned the talks when the government refused to discuss their pay demands, 
the official news agency PAP said. Today's balloting is for 48,000 seats in 
local government.
