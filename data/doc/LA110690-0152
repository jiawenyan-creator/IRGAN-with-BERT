ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON; 
$334,000 STATE GRANT FOR LEISURE CENTER 
The city has received a $334,000 grant from the state to help build a 
$2.44-million recreation facility that would double the size of the existing 
Cultural Arts and Recreation Center, city officials said. 
Recreation Director Mary Gonye said the expansion would enable the city to 
provide as many as six programs, such as karate, ballroom dancing and ballet 
classes, all at the same time. 
The present building has only one main room, limiting the number of groups that 
can use it at a given time. 
The proposed 14,450-square-foot facility, to be completed by August, 1992, will 
replace the existing center at the corner of Cedar Street and Katella Avenue, 
City Manager Terry Matz said. 
The facility is now in the design stage and will be constructed at the same 
time as the the new civic center at 7800 Katella. Matz said no decision has yet 
been made on whether the two projects will be combined into a single building. 
Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) helped the city obtain the grant, 
which is funded by a state surtax on cigarettes and tobacco and earmarked for 
parks and recreation projects. 
"I sense that there's excitement. This has been a demonstrated community need 
for the last several years," Matz said.
