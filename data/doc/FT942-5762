FT  03 JUN 94 / World News in Brief: Poll says Tories face disaster in
Europe elections
Prime minister John Major hardened the tone of his attacks on European
integration as a Gallup poll in today's Daily Telegraph suggested that the
Conservatives face disaster in Thursday's elections for the European
parliament.
It puts the Conservatives in third place behind the Liberal Democrats and
more than 30 percentage points behind Labour. It estimates support for the
Conservatives at just 21 per cent, compared with 21.5 per cent for the
Liberal Democrats, and 54 per cent for Labour.
