FT  03 JUL 92 / CBI steps up pressure on Heseltine
THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday renewed its calls for a new
era of co-operation between government and manufacturers on the eve of an
announcement by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, of plans
to make the DTI a more effective champion for industry.
Sir Alistair Frame, chairman of the CBI's national manufacturing council,
said UK manufacturers were unlikely to achieve their targets of winning an
extra 1 per cent of world trade and of boosting manufacturing exports by
Pounds 10bn a year without positive government support.
Speaking after a meeting of the council in Coventry, Sir Alistair said
manufacturers were asking not for government handouts or subsidies but for
the ability to compete on an equal footing with their international
competitors. He said many competitors had the advantage of cheaper
electricity costs, better export support and enhanced investment allowances
for new technology, pollution control and energy-saving equipment.
'Unless the government addresses these problems as a matter of urgency it
seems inevitable that the competitiveness of British exporters will continue
to diminish,' Sir Alistair added.
He called on Mr Heseltine to champion industry by giving leadership in
international trade and by encouraging easy and direct access for industry
to ensure effective consultation with the government.
Mr Heseltine will today unveil plans to improve the effectiveness of the DTI
as industry's sponsoring department. They are expected to include the
creation of at least 12 groups to represent their industries' views in
Whitehall.
