  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and British Secretary of State for Trade and Industry 
Michael Heseltine confirmed Monday [10 January] their 
governments' resolve to go ahead with economic deregulation, 
government officials said. 
  "It is a landmark development that Japan in line with 
deregulation, which has been on the agenda for years, is setting 
up third-party institutions," Hosokawa was quoted as telling 
Heseltine. 
  Heseltine, while stressing that Britain will continue 
efforts 
to cut back trade hampering regulations, said that compared with 
other European countries the British economy is in a stable 
condition. 
  Heseltine flew in from Taiwan on Sunday and will return to 
Britain on Tuesday.
