STORM PREDICTIONS SCORES UPSET WIN, MERCEDES WON 3RD IN TAMPA BAY DERBY 
Storm Predictions tied a track record Sunday while holding on for an upset 
victory in the Tampa Bay Derby at Tampa Bay Downs. 
Storm Predictions took the lead turning for home and withstood a late charge by 
With Approval to score a 1 3/4-furlong win in 1:43 4/5 for the 1 1/16-mile 
track. 
"The key today was getting him to relax early," said winning jockey Steven 
Gaffalione. "The race couldn't have set up any better if they had written a 
book for us. When I asked him at the half-mile pole, he just took off." 
Mercedes Won, the favorite, finished third after taking the lead around the far 
turn. 
"I can't make any real excuses for him," jockey Earlie Fires said. "We had to 
move a little faster than I wanted to leaving the back stretch. . . . But he 
came up empty in the lane and had nothing left." 
Storm Predictions paid $19.00, $6.60 and $3.20. With Approval paid $8.20 and 
$4, and Mercedes Won paid $2.60.
