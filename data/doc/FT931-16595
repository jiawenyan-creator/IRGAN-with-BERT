Lebanon

Israel said it would not alter its decision to expel 415 Palestinians to
Lebanon despite the threat of further action by the UN Security Council and
the despatch of a second UN envoy, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem.
The government hopes the visit later this week of Mr Chinmaya Gharekhan,
special adviser to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, will
overcome the deadlock between Israel and Lebanon over the supply of
humanitarian aid to the Palestinians, stranded for almost three weeks in
no-man's land in south Lebanon. Officials also hope to use the visit to fend
off Arab demands for UN sanctions if Israel persists in ignoring Security
Council resolution 799 calling for reversal of the expulsions.
Israeli forces detained 17 relatives of a Palestinian suspected of
involvement in the killing of a secret service agent in Jerusalem on Sunday.
At least 15 other people were also held.
