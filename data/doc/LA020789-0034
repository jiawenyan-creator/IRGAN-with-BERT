AUTO INSURANCE CONTROVERSY 
Your article on inflated auto insurance claims was great. It showed that the 
real cause of high auto insurance rates is greedy accident "victims" and their 
equally greedy lawyers and doctors. But why did you wait until now to come out 
with this story? Why didn't you come out with it when it could have made a real 
impact -- before the elections? 
Who knows, if you had, we might now have the no-fault type insurance we need to 
eliminate the higher costs brought on by such inflated claims.
