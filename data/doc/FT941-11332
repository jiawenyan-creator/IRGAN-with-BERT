FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Austria to sell VA Tech on May
16
Voest-Alpine Technologie (VA Tech), engineering group, is to be privatised
on May 16 with a four-day flotation of 51 per cent of the company's capital
on the Vienna stock exchange.
The sale, which the government hopes will raise about Sch5bn (Dollars 416m),
is part of a large Austrian privatisation programme approved in November.
VA Tech is the largest group to be privatised within the former Austrian
Industries (AI) state industrial group which was dissolved in December
following heavy losses.
Analysts expect the flotation of VA Tech, which consists of several
engineering, construction and energy companies, to attract strong
international interest.
The privatisation programme will include the sale of state shareholdings in
OMV, the oil and chemicals group; SGP Verkerstechnik, the railways rolling
stock manufacturer; Austria Mikrosysteme, maker of customised microchip; and
Vamed, a hospital construction group.
