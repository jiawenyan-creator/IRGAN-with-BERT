SHIELDS TO HEAD STATE SCIENCE COUNCIL 
L. Donald Shields, former president of both Cal State Fullerton and Southern 
Methodist University, has accepted a position as head of the new California 
Council on Science and Technology, officials said Wednesday. 
Shields had been president of Cal State Fullerton for nine years. At the time 
he was appointed, he was the nation's youngest state university president at 
age 34. 
He resigned from SMU citing medical reasons in 1986, as a school football 
scandal was unfolding. After it was revealed that the school's trustees, with 
Gov. Bill Clements as chairman, had approved a play-for-pay scheme for 
athletes, the NCAA imposed its "death penalty" on the school and its football 
program was dropped for two years.
