CHUCK CLUSTKA FOLLOWED WOODEN'S PHILOSOPHY 
One of the first of the many John Wooden "boys," Chuck Clustka, passed away 
Aug. 20, 1989, in Orange County. 
Chuck adopted and lived by Coach Wooden's philosophy of life, as a devoted 
family man and Christian, coach, teacher, educator and inspired fund-raiser for 
many humanitarian programs and projects in this area. 
The entire Southern California community is a better place in which to live 
because of the influence of Chuck Clustka's life. 
He was a true sportsman.
