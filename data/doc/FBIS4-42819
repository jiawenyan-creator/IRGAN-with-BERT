  [Text] Vienna, June 8 (AFP) -- Almost all fuel rods have 
been removed from the core of the experimental reactor believed 
by western experts to be feeding a covert North Korean nuclear 
arms programme, the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] 
said here Wednesday [8 June]. 
  Discharging of the five megawatt reactor had now been 90 
percent completed, said a spokesman for the International Atomic 
Energy Agency. 
  Pyongyang has repeatedly refused to allow IAEA inspectors 
access to the reactor and one other nuclear site where the 
Agency suspects solid and liquid nuclear waste from a military 
nuclear programme are stocked. 
  IAEA Director General Hans Blix told the UN Security Council 
last week that 70 percent of the fuel rods from the experimental 
reactor had been removed, and that the organisation was no 
longer in a position to prove whether North Korea was building 
bombs. 
  Blix said the IAEA knows "undeclared plutonium" exists in 
North Korea but does not know if it amounts to grammes (ounces) 
or kilogrammes (pounds). At least eight kilos (17.6 pounds) of 
plutonium are needed to build a nuclear weapon. 
  The IAEA board of governors is due to meet behind closed 
doors here Thursday, with the Pyongyang nuclear crisis likely to 
head the agenda, an IAEA spokesman said earlier Wednesday. 
  On Tuesday North Korea repeated its categoric refusal to 
allow access to its two sites.
