FT  19 JAN 93 / Independent Ulster inquiry begins
AN international commission of inquiry seeking ways forward on Northern
Ireland begins three weeks of public hearings today in Belfast.
The commission is chaired by Professor Torkel Opsahl, an international human
rights lawyer and United Nations adviser. Other members include Mr Eamonn
Gallagher, the former EC director-general of Fisheries, and Lady Faulkner of
Downpatrick, a former BBC governor for Northern Ireland, whose husband Brian
was the last Stormont prime minister. The idea for the commission came from
Initiative '92, an independent non-political group formed two years ago by
Professor Simon Lee, a law professor at Queen's University, Belfast, and Mr
Robin Wilson, the editor of Fortnight, a local current affairs magazine.
It is funded by several charity groups led by the Joseph Rowntree Trust,
Barrow Cadbury, the Northern Ireland Voluntary Trust and the Nuffield
Foundation.
Prof Lee said yesterday: 'Our main aim is to broaden and deepen dialogue and
to prod the government and politicians into thinking of different ways
forward.'
Over the past eight months the commission has compiled more than 500 written
submissions from a broad cross-section of local public opinion, ranging from
Confederation of British Industry members to community-based groups.
Over the next two days it takes evidence from figures as diverse as Sir
Kenneth Bloomfield, former head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, and
an as yet unnamed official of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA.
