FT  21 JUL 93 / Serb forces close in on Sarajevo
A SERB offensive was reported to be closing in on Sarajevo yesterday and
fighting between Moslems and Croats raged in central Bosnia, Reuter reports
from Sarajevo. This was the backdrop to a new EC peace mission as Mr Willy
Claes, Belgian foreign minister, arrived to try to bring the warring parties
to the negotiating table.
He warned Serbs and Croats: 'If they do not follow the rules of the game,
they must expect a reinforcement of sanctions and even the use of methods
that up to now we have refused to use.'
Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency said Serb forces had taken the
southwestern part of Mount Igman, a stronghold of the Moslem-led government
army overlooking the Sarajevo and now under heavy attack.
In central Bosnia, heavy fighting was reported between government forces and
both Serbs and Croats. The two towns of Bugojno and Maglaj came under
intense bombardment.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is making a direct appeal
to the public of several countries including Britain, the US and Italy to
help make up an estimated Dollars 100m shortfall in this year's Dollars 420m
budget, writes Mark Suzman in London.
