  [Text] Next year the Netherlands will have a National 
Bureau for Wind Energy. This independent institution will 
promote the application of wind energy and provide scientific 
information. A location for the bureau has not yet been 
decided. The initiative comes from the Organization for Lasting 
Energy [ODE], the Netherlands Association for Wind Energy 
[Newin], and the Netherlands Energy and the Environment Company 
[Novem]. ``The Bureau should partly assume the work which was 
formerly done by Newin and ODE separately,'' says Mirjam Tielen, 
staff member from ODE. Novem, together with industry, supplies 
the funding of the bureau.
