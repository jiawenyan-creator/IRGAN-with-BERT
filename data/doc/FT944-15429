FT  18 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
Stock index futures were volatile in dull volume, swinging about erratically
but eventually closing comfortably up on the day, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 18 points higher at 3,140 at the
official 4.10pm close, having touched a 3,163 best for the day towards the
end of the morning session.
At this level the premium to the cash market was around 20 points and the
fair value premium just short of 13 points.
Trading volume was flat, with just 11,811 contracts showing at the official
close, down from an average of 15,000 for the final two days of last week.
Traders said there was very little two-way business and that most deals were
hard to trade. 'Everybody's unsure of direction,' commented one trader.
Futures markets were watching the dollar, as it made its response to the
outcome of the German elections.
On the upside, traders see 3,170 as the most immediate selling point. Wall
Street continues to provide the strongest leads.
Activity in traded options was also light, with 22,778 lots comparing with
34,231 contracts on Friday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trading accounted for just
over 14,000 lots.
British Aerospace headed the list of active individual options with 1,868
lots dealt. British Steel (1,844 lots) and HSBC were also busy.
