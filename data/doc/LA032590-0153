EL SEGUNDO TO SUE L.A. OVER HYPERION PLANT 
Angered by last week's release of strong fumes from Los Angeles' Hyperion 
Sewage Treatment Plant, which sent one resident to the hospital, the El Segundo 
City Council voted unanimously Friday to sue Los Angeles and demand a full 
investigation of environmental and health problems posed by Hyperion. 
The sprawling coastal plant borders El Segundo. 
City Atty. Leland Dolley said the suit branding Hyperion a public nuisance will 
be filed in Los Angeles Superior Court within a week. He said the city will 
seek an injunction compelling Hyperion to eliminate odor and health problems at 
the earliest opportunity. 
Councilman Scot Dannen moved that the suit be filed, contending the city faces 
a "stone wall" with Hyperion. Los Angeles officials have acknowledged odor 
problems at Hyperion but have said some will disappear with the plant expansion 
now under way. 
The council said in December that it would sue Los Angeles over Hyperion. It 
has collected 125 affidavits from residents about health, safety and emotional 
problems associated with the sewage treatment plant. However, in response to 
the March 19 incident at Hyperion, City Manager Ron Cano on Friday urged 
immediate action. "The time is now. We owe it to the citizens," he told the 
council. 
In that incident, Cano said, one resident near the plant was treated at Robert 
F. Kennedy Medical Center in Hawthorne after complaining of burning eyes and 
nose. Two others complained of sore throats and eyes. 
Cano said preliminary investigations by the city and the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District failed to determine what produced the fumes, 
although chlorine or ammonia was suspected at the time. Hyperion officials said 
a scrubbing device used to remove hydrogen sulfide gases had malfunctioned, but 
the source of the fumes could not be pinpointed.
