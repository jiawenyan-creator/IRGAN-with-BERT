EMPEROR ROSKO RULES HIS REALM FROM AFAR; 
THOUSAND OAKS DISC JOCKEY REACHES LISTENERS IN 27 COUNTRIES BUT YEARNS TO ADD 
L.A. TO HIS DOMAIN 
"I've been the No. 1 DJ in Paris and the No. 1 DJ in London," says Mike 
Pasternak, alias Emperor Rosko. "I'd like to become the No. 1 DJ in L.A., but 
that's no easy thing to do." 
Pasternak sits in the broadcasting studio in his Thousand Oaks home. Around him 
is all the right equipment -- turntables, CD player, sound effects gadgets. 
Stacked against the wall are newly released records, sent gratis from labels in 
the U.S. and Europe. He even has fan mail. 
 Dear Rosko, 
 About two weeks ago I sended you a letter -- don't you receive it? I think you 
get it shortly. Rosko, you are so manly. I've got your pictures and your voice 
on my tape-recording -- my friends are very jealous. 
 But Pasternak won't be meeting Monika, the letter-writer, at a personal 
appearance. He won't be taking dedications from her or any other listeners. 
Emperor Rosko does reign, but only in Europe. 
Monika lives in Poland and hears him over Radio Luxembourg. Other fans listen 
on the BBC's Radio 1 or on Swiss Romande. Pasternak produces the programs -- 
some of them weekly, some of them specials -- in Thousand Oaks and mails the 
tapes overseas. Many of his contacts were made during stints as a DJ in England 
and France -- successful stints that have failed to translate into a major 
radio career in Los Angeles. 
Pasternak, 46, spent nearly two years in 1966-67 as a disc jockey on the 
original pirate station, Radio Caroline, a ship that broadcast off the coast of 
England. The station had no government licenses and paid no taxes and spawned a 
number of imitators. From 1969 to 1975, he hosted "World Service Countdown," a 
BBC program styled after "American Top 40." The British edition of Billboard 
magazine named him top European DJ of 1976. 
"I could tell a thousand stories about the pirate radio days," he said. "It was 
both very exciting and very boring, because we'd do two weeks on the ship and 
one week off. Sometimes there was absolutely nothing to do. So we'd say on the 
air, 'If you support Radio Caroline, drive to the cliffs tonight and turn on 
your headlamps.' They'd do it, and it was a tremendous thing to see." 
Pasternak was introduced to Europe at an early age. The son of movie producer 
Joe Pasternak ("Where the Boys Are," "The Great Caruso"), he was born and 
educated in Los Angeles but also attended boarding schools in Switzerland and 
Paris. He said his years overseas have helped him understand his audience's 
tastes. 
At various times Emperor Rosko has recrowned himself Kaiser Rosko or Le 
President Rosko. He gives listeners a mix of U.S. and European music, celebrity 
interviews and entertainment news delivered in a zany, manic style. A typical 
set might include some Beatles tunes, more recent oldies by such people as 
Bronski Beat and new music; an interview with Cyndi Lauper, and a contest in 
which listeners identify songs from snippets. 
"I read everything from The Times to the National Enquirer to get my material, 
although 80% of it is from the Enquirer end of the scale," Pasternak said. "I 
sell the image of Palm Springs and Malibu. As far as they're concerned, I'm at 
the beach." 
To foster that impression, Emperor Rosko mixes the sound of sea gulls and surf 
into some of his broadcasts. Rather than a Thousand Oaks address, he uses a 
post office box on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. And he does not let facts 
hinder the creativity of his reporting. Two days before a jury convicted Zsa 
Zsa Gabor of slapping a Beverly Hills policeman, Emperor Rosko reported the 
guilty verdict on a tape mailed to Europe. 
"I just knew she couldn't get away with it, so I went with my instincts," 
Pasternak said. 
Radio Luxembourg, with its high-powered transmitter, broadcasts Emperor Rosko 
to 27 countries. Pasternak has gotten mail from as far away as Russia and 
Czechoslovakia. 
"It does sound you are really enjoying yourself," writes Phil Davson from 
Switzerland in a recent letter. "Yes, it's definitely a happening show on Luxy 
-- probably the only happening show." 
Pasternak does the "Luxy" show in English. Programs for France are done in 
French. 
He makes liberal use of horns and whistles and often closes with: "Emperor 
Roscoe has enjoyed himself, my subjects. My padded cell awaits me now." 
Pasternak has been exporting programs to Europe for 10 years, ever since he 
moved back to California. He said he left Europe to attempt a U.S. radio career 
and also to be near his father, who has been ill. 
Pasternak said the shows take two days a week to produce, and he fleshes out 
his living as a mobile disc jockey. He provides music at weddings and other 
parties and performs at personal appearances by Casey Kasem. 
"Casey does the first 15 minutes, gets all the attention, and I do the rest," 
he said. 
"He's one of the best DJs around," Kasem said. "I've used him many times at 
dances. He puts together sets so that he gets young and old on their feet and 
keeps them there. He mixes both oldies and new songs." 
Pasternak fell under radio's spell while growing up in the 1950s and '60s. He 
borrowed his on-air moniker from a black Los Angeles disc jockey, Bill Mercer, 
who called himself Rosko. He also admired Johnny Hayes, Wolfman Jack and, in 
San Francisco, Bob Mitchell and Tom Donaghue. 
The Wolfman influence is evident, as Emperor Rosko's voice often takes on a 
raspy sound. 
"I did a show with Wolf on the BBC," Pasternak recalled. "I take him off pretty 
good, so we had a contest to see if anyone could tell us apart. They couldn't." 
Pasternak is divorced and has no children. He said radio occupies the central 
place in his life. 
"It was always my love," he said. "I could have been an actor. My dad was a 
producer. But I loved the music. I loved rapping along with the rhythm of the 
songs." 
He also enjoyed the interplay with audiences, taking calls and dedications. 
"To be able to have that kind of fun with people is the ultimate trip," he 
said. 
But with an ocean and a continent separating Emperor Rosko and his subjects, 
the immediacy is lost. "L.A. is the toughest town in the world for a DJ," he 
said. "Everybody comes here. Maybe to make it you have to be able to sell 
yourself better than I can. Sometimes I wish I could stick a transmitter on the 
roof of my house and just broadcast from here."
