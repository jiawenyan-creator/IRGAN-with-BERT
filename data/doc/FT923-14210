FT  09 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Building societies criticised
MR PAUL BOATENG, Labour Treasury spokesman, last night condemned building
societies that were unwilling to co-operate in providing help for elderly
people in danger of losing their properties as a result of the failure of
home-income schemes, Ivor Owen writes.
In a debate on the Finance Bill he said building societies that had traded
on their good name to promote such schemes should not be allowed to hide
behind a veil of secrecy when they went wrong.
While expressing sympathy for those concerned, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic
secretary to the Treasury, said many elderly home owners had engaged in
'high-risk' deals.
