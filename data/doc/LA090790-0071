BRIEFLY 
RTC Wins Stay in Return of S&amp;L: A federal appeals panel ordered the 
Resolution Trust Corp. to retake control of Franklin Savings Assn. 
-- just hours after the thrift's managers had moved back into their offices. 
Operators of the largest thrift in Kansas were allowed back in the offices in 
the morning, after U.S. District Judge Dale E. Saffels ruled Wednesday that 
regulators had improperly seized the S&amp;L. But the government obtained a 
stay Thursday afternoon from the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. 
Franklin officials could not be reached for comment.
