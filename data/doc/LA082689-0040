POP MUSIC REVIEW; 
REGINA BELLE AT AT MY PLACE 
It's a shame about Regina Belle. 
The R&amp;B singer, who appeared at At My Place Thursday night, doesn't have 
much good material. She's also caught up in pop trappings that are threatening 
to strangle her. 
When it comes to sheer vocal skills -- range, power and the ability to convey 
feeling -- Belle has few peers in the genre. But on Thursday she was singing 
up-tempo songs with Bobby Brown-like arrangements, apparently to appeal to the 
kids. She was also singing ballads mired in pop excesses. 
Belle's hourlong show included maybe two or three songs worthy of her talents. 
With her pedestrian instrumental support, she was like a diamond in a setting 
studded with pebbles. She was accompanied by uninspired, plodding musicians who 
did nothing to enhance the material. Her backup singers were a help on a few 
songs, but most of the time they were just a distraction. Belle is quite 
capable of carrying a show vocally all by herself. 
Belle's focus is all wrong. She should be going in Anita Baker's direction, 
focusing on stirring, quality ballads. Her accompaniment should be spare -- 
that's all a superb singer like her really needs. DENNIS HUNT
