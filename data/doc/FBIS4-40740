  [Text] Former USSR prime minister Nikolay Ryzhkov denied 
rumors that he had agreed to run for Russian presidency. 
  Aleksandr Sterligov, the leader of the opposition Russian 
National Assembly, and Sazhi Umalatova, chairperson of the 
so-called permanent presidium of the USSR Congress of People's 
Deputies, had mentioned the possibility of nominating Ryzhkov 
for presidency in their public addresses. 
  Ryzhkov told Interfax that Sterligov and Umalatova expressed 
their personal views when they spoke of him as a man who could 
rally all opposition forces for the forthcoming presidential 
elections. 
  He admitted that numerous people think that he might be 
helpful in consolidating society to an extent. 
  Ryzhkov assumed that his name was mentioned because people 
were tired of radicalism in any form, from Yegor Gaydar's shock 
therapy to Zhirinovsky's promises. Ryzhkov said that he had 
never shared extreme views but stayed somewhat left of the 
center. 
  He did not believe the opposition-spread rumors that Boris 
Yeltsin intended to call pre-term presidential elections next 
fall or to extend his and the Federal Assembly's terms. 
  Ryzhkov, 64, was the USSR's prime minister in 1985-90. Now 
he heads the Moscow Intellectual and Business Club and chairs 
the board of the Tveruniversalbank.
