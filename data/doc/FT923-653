FT  26 SEP 92 / FT deputy chief executive to retire
MR RICHARD McCLEAN, deputy chief executive of the Financial Times, is to
retire next July after 38 years with the group.
Mr McClean originally joined the advertisement department and became the
first advertisement director to reach the FT board, later taking
responsibility for circulation sales and marketing as well as advertisement
sales. He subsequently became managing director.
He developed the 'No FT . . . no comment' slogan and was one of the guiding
spirits behind the newspaper's expansion programme from its first printing
in continental Europe to the US and Japan.
Mr David Palmer, chief executive, said yesterday that Mr McClean had told
him some time ago of his intention to retire in his mid 50s and to do
something completely different.
'While I shall greatly miss the breadth of his experience and the depth of
his support after his departure, I am delighted that he will continue to be
with us for another nine months,' Mr Palmer said.
Mr David Bell, now advertisement director, will become managing director of
FT Newspaper next July. He will be responsible for the FT's day-to-day
operations and for its financial performance. Mr Tony Blin-Stoyle will
become advertisement director.
