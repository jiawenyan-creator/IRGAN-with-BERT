  [Text] Secretary-General Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] attended a symposium sponsored by the party's 
Tokyo Metropolitan Chapter in Tokyo on 28 May. Touching on the 
issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected nuclear arms 
development, Ozawa said: "In Japan, no regulations on crisis 
management in an emergency are stipulated in any laws, including 
the constitution. If something unexpected should take place, 
administrative work will completely fail to function." Thus, he 
stressed his idea that the government should improve its crisis 
management system legally by taking such measures as legislation 
of an emergency bill. 
  Citing as an allegory, Ozawa pointed out: "Suppose all the 
cabinet members were killed by bombs dropped on the prime 
minister's official residence during a cabinet meeting, the 
succeeding prime minister could only be elected if the Diet was 
in session. However, there are no regulations whatsoever as to 
what should be done if the Diet was in recess." Then, he added: 
"An emergency could possibly arise even in a natural disaster."
