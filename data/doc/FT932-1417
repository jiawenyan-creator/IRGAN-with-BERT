FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Fortis seeks bank stake
FORTIS, the Dutch-Belgian financial services company, has started detailed
talks on taking a 'significant' stake in the Belgian state-owned savings
bank ASLK-CGER, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam.
ASLK-CGER has granted Fortis an exclusive but temporary right to negotiate a
deal, in preference to Belgium's largest bank, Generale de Banque, which had
also submitted an indicative, non-binding offer for the bank in May.
The Belgian government has said that it might be prepared to sell a majority
stake in ASLK-CGER. However, Belgian law would have to be amended to allow
this.
A 49 per cent stake in the Belgian savings bank could be worth up to
BFr33bn.
Fortis and ASLK-CGER said: 'Both parties are convinced that a possible
agreement between them would bring considerable opportunities, and open the
way for them to play a leading role in Europe while preserving the identity
and the operational autonomy of each company.'
