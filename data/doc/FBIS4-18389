  [Text] The export deal with Iraq, which a man from 
Mannheim initiated via the German Mission to the UN in New York, 
has been suspended for the time being. For the export 
application, Ariel Schweininger, the wire-puller of the deal, 
used a new procedure established for "fair trading" that permits 
making parallel permit applications. The applications were made 
in New York beforehand and, only four weeks later, at the 
Federal Export Office in Eschborn. In addition: Eschborn has 
received applications for deliveries worth 85 million German 
marks, and New York has received applications for exports worth 
$1.3 billion. At the moment, the federal authorities are 
checking whether Schweininger is to free some of Iraq's frozen 
foreign currency reserves with this deal.
