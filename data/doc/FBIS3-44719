  [Text] Hsiao Wan-chang, chairman of the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development, said yesterday [6 January] 
that while direct shipping services between the mainland and 
Taiwan will be inevitable in the future, the time and methods of 
the services involve certain technical issues that cannot be 
decided by us alone. He said that to further develop 
cross-strait relations, the government is now taking the 
initiative in handling the issue with a positive, pragmatic, and 
sensible attitude. 
  Hsiao said that he is not in favor of controlling exports to 
the mainland. 
  Commenting on a statement made by the Directorate of 
Budgets, 
Accounting, and Statistics on 5 January that the country's 
export dependency on the mainland has approached the danger 
point, Hsiao pointed out that there is no danger point for the 
development of cross-strait economic development and trade. He 
said he does not believe that exports to the mainland should be 
controlled when they approach the 10-percent level. He said 
that such a control is not in the interests of the country 
because it would hurt us first before hurting the other side.
