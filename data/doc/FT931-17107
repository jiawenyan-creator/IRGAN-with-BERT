FT  02 JAN 93 / Letter: Onerous burden in order to satisfy Inland Revenue
Sir, The Q &amp; A Briefcase item, 'How to work out that CGT bill' (December
19), highlights the onerous burden that this tax imposes. I had rather
similar calculations to perform earlier this year when I sold some
accumulation units; each tax voucher since March 1982 had to be indexed. I
reached retirement age more than eight years ago but fortunately I am still
sufficiently numerate to cope.
Monthly savings schemes and accumulation funds are, by their nature, most
likely to be cashed in by elderly persons who had prudently been using them
to make extra provision for their old age. Many might find the calculations
daunting if not altogether beyond them.
Pensioners ought not to find themselves obliged to incur accountants' fees
in order to satisfy the Inland Revenue: a very poor reward for thrift.
The sums involved are unlikely to be large and a budget concession absolving
the elderly from CGT liability on savings schemes of these sorts would be
most welcome. Something for the chancellor to think about when he has a
moment to spare.
