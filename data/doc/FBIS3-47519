  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 13 (YONHAP) -- An Army engineer unit of 
12 officers and 158 enlisted men will fly to Somalia on Thursday 
[13 January] night for a six-month shift of construction work as 
part of the U.N. peacekeeping operation in the east African 
country. 
  The unit will replace the unit dispatched there in July last 
year to build roads and irrigation channels North of Mogadishu. 
  The departure was delayed by 24 hours because of engine 
trouble on their aircraft.
