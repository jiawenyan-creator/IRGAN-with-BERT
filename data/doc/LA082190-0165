BOXING; 
STARLING, HAVING LOST TITLE, SAYS HE'LL RETIRE 
Marlon Starling, who lost his World Boxing Council welterweight title to 
Maurice Blocker on Sunday, said the fight will be his last. 
"I quit," Starling said Monday from a Reno, Nev., hospital bed. 
"I retire. It's over." 
Friends and advisers of Starling, a Hartford native, said they believe the 
two-time world champion is serious about retiring. 
"He means it right now," said Melanie Byrd, a close friend. 
"I think it's a distinct possibility," said Starling's adviser, Mort Sharnik. 
"It's his decision alone." 
"He had a great career," said Starling's trainer, Freddie Roach. "If that's 
what he decides, great. None of us would be disappointed." 
Starling, who turns 32 next week, said his age and trouble with making weight 
finally caught up with him. 
"I knew it was going to catch up with me someday," Starling said in an 
interview with the Hartford Courant. "I never felt like quitting before, but I 
felt like quitting this time." 
Blocker earned a majority decision, winning on two judges' cards. The third 
judge had the fight even. 
Starling said he is proud of his 11-year pro career. "I always tried my best," 
Starling said. "You can't win them all, but at least I tried. That's all you 
can do."
