<DOCTITLE>Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co.; Notice of Proposed Change in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>


September 12, 1994.


Take notice that on September 6, 1994, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Compnay (Panhandle) tendered for filing the revised
tariff sheets listed on Appendix A of its filing to FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1. The proposed effective
date of the revised tariff sheets is October 1, 1994.
Panhandle states that is filing proposes the recovery of certain stranded costs by means of Reservation Surcharges
applicable to service under Rate Schedule FT, EFT and SCT and Volumetric Surcharges applicable to interruptible
rates under Rate Schedules IT and EIT.
Panhandle states that the revised tariff sheets filed herewith currently reflect the recovery of stranded costs
removed from Panhandle's filing in Docket No. RP94325000 as a result of the Commission's August 19,
1994, Order in that docket. In the August 19, 1994, Order, certain Order No. 636 stranded costs were excluded from the
Gas Supply Realignment (GSR) Surcharge that relate to Acount No. 165 recoupable take-or-pay and the unrecovered
balance of a take-or-pay settlement agreement with a former affiliate. These two categories of costs became stranded
upon the termination of Panhandle's merchant function and thus are recoverable costs. The Commission stated that
Panhandle is not precluded from making a separate filing to recover these costs as stranded costs, although they were
not considered by the Commission to be GSR costs. Accordingly, including in the instant filing are tariff sheets to
establish such a mechanism that will commence the recovery of these stranded costs.
Panhandle states that copies of its filing have been served on all affected customers, and applicable state regulatory
commissions.
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest the said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with 385.214
and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before September
19, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference
Room.
