HIT-RUN DRIVER KILLS FULLERTON PEDESTRIAN 
Fullerton police Wednesday were seeking the driver of a Cadillac that struck 
and killed a pedestrian as he crossed a street against a red light and a 
flashing "Don't Walk" signal. 
Officer Wayne Dale, who is investigating the accident, said a pale-yellow 
Cadillac struck the unidentified man about 1:45 p.m. as he crossed southbound 
on Highland Avenue at Orangethorpe Avenue. 
The man was hurled onto the windshield, then thrown 95 feet as the car traveled 
west on Orangethorpe, Dale said. 
The force of the impact knocked the man out of his socks and shoes, Dale said. 
Police have not yet identified the victim. 
Witnesses said the Cadillac sped away. Police have no description of the driver 
but said the car is a two-door model manufactured between the years 1979 and 
1982.
