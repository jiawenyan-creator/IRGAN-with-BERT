FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (2): Lightest cellphone
launched
Motorola has just launched the MicroTac International 7200, which it claims
is the world's lightest GSM digital cellular telephone. Weighing just 215
grams, the MicroTac 7200 is 25 per cent lighter and about 20 per cent
smaller than the MicroTac 5000 series GSM cellular telephones launched in
March.
Of particular significance is the introduction of SMS (short message
service) into Motorola's GSM range, which enables the user to send and
receive short data messages.
Features include a four-line, 24 character supertwist display, 100
alphanumeric memory, continuous signal strength and battery level indicator
and a call-in absence alert.
