  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP January 6 -- German Ambassador to 
Cambodia Von Treskow Wiprecht presented here Wednesday 
credentials to Acting President Chea Sim. 
  Speaking to German ambassador, Chea Sim affirmed that the 
German ambassador's mission was very important in strengthening 
and development the ties of friendship, solidarity and 
cooperation between Cambodia and Germany. 
  The acting president also expressed thanks to the government 
and people of Germany who have assisted Cambodia in its national 
rehabilitation and reconstruction. 
  Since the re-ascension to the Cambodian throne of King 
Norodom Sihanouk on August 24, 1993, four countries have 
assigned their ambassador to the Kingdom of Cambodia, including 
the Republic of China, the Kingdom of Thailand, the Russian 
Federation and the Federal Republic of Germany, and their 
credential letters were already presented. 
  Two more ambassadors to the Kingdom of Cambodia, including 
the Egyptian and Filipino ambassadors, will present their 
credentials to the Cambodian leader soon.
