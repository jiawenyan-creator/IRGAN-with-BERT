  [Text] Rome, May 17 -- Polish Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak, on a visit to Italy, was received by Pope John Paul II 
on Tuesday [17 May]. 
  Prime Minister Pawlak coming out of the meeting said that 
the 
pope was feeling well. He said he discussed with the pope the 
social, economic and political situation in Poland. 
  Pawlak added that during the meeting, the two also touched 
upon the question of the ratification of the concordat signed by 
the Republic of Poland and the Holy See. 
  In Pawlak's opinion "the parliamentary debate on the 
ratification of the concordat will be very difficult. I am 
convinced that it will end favourably," said the prime minister. 
  The Polish-born pope is staying at the Gemelli Clinic where 
he is recovering from a broken right thigh bone since April 29. 
  Before meeting with the pope, Prime Minister Pawlak laid a 
wreath at the altar of the homeland and toured the colosseum 
together with members of the Polish delegation. 
  Following the meeting with the pope, the prime minister went 
to the Vatican where he was received by secretary of state, 
Cardinal Angelo Sodano.
