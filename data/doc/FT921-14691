FT  15 JAN 92 / Japanese prices hold steady
JAPAN'S overall and domestic wholesale price indices (WPI) were steady in
December compared with November levels but fell from a year earlier mostly
because of a strong yen and a slowing domestic economy, economists said,
Reuter reports from Tokyo.
'Any increase in domestic prices is likely to have been cancelled out by
lower import prices due to the strength of the yen,' said Mr Kusuo Aoki, an
economist at the Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities and Economics.
The nation's overall wholesale price index was unchanged in December from
the previous month but fell 1.6 per cent from a year earlier, the Bank of
Japan (BOJ) announced earlier today.
Import prices declined 16.7 per cent year-on-year compared with a 15.5 per
cent drop in November.
Japan's domestic WPI, a key component of overall WPI, was unchanged on the
month but fell 0.2 per cent from a year earlier, the BOJ said.
The yen's strength against the dollar was also a factor for the year-on-year
decline in overall wholesale prices, economists said. The dollar closed on
average in Tokyo at Y128.07 in December 1991 compared with Y133.72 in
December 1990, according to BOJ statistics.
A decline in imported oil prices also contributed to the drop in the WPI
from the previous year. Oil prices rose to over Dollars 30 a barrel in
December 1990 because of the Gulf crisis but have since eased to around
Dollars 20 per barrel.
Trends in the WPI tend to foreshadow the performance of the overall economy,
economists said. Hence, wholesale prices may be expected to pick up by the
end of the second quarter as Japan's economy is forecast to resume its
expansionary trend by summer.
