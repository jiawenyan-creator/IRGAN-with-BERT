FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Nymex opts to remain in New York
City
THE New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), the world's largest energy market,
will remain in New York City.
The Nymex board voted late on Tuesday to move the exchange to a building at
390 Greenwich Street in Manhattan. The move is scheduled for late 1994. The
Greenwich Street property, built in 1986 and specifically designed for
technology intensive use, is owned by the American Express unit Shearson
Lehman Brothers.
Nymex's decision to stay is a boon for New York City, which is struggling
financially.
Mr Carl Weisbrod, president of New York's Economic Development Corporation,
declined to give details of the incentives the city offered Nymex to remain.
However, he said they included funds for building renovation, special tax
benefits, and an agreement for subsidised power.
Nymex pays Dollars 75m in city and state taxes each year.
The new address is just a few blocks away from the site where the Nymex's
sister exchanges, the Commodity Exchange, The New York Futures Exchange, and
the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange are negotiating to build a facility.
All four of New York's futures exchanges are now jammed into a single
25,000-foot trading floor in the World Trade Center. Seeking to relieve the
congestion, the exchanges discussed leaving New York entirely and relocating
to New Jersey, where costs were believed to be lower.
That plan was abandoned last year.
Nymex broke off from the group after a series of disagreements and since
then has been searching for its own premises.
Last year 27.8m futures and options contracts changed hands at Nymex. A
majority of those were in the exchange's crude oil futures pit, which is
used to price oil transactions worldwide.
