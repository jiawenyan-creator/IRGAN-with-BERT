FT  08 MAY 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar falls against D-Mark
THE DOLLAR failed to develop an advance based on comments from a Bundesbank
official that Germany has no intention of raising interest rates at the
moment. On this remark it hit resistance at around DM1.7320, but then
retreated through support at DM1.7200 to a low of DM1.7150, before rallying
slightly at the London close.
Mr Norbert Kloten, a member of the Bundesbank council, said the central bank
has 'no intention at the moment to raise interest rates', but that the
Bundesbank is concerned about high wage settlements and the effect on
inflation. Mr Kloten added that he expects the German economy to recover
next year.
Concern about US President George Bush's health, which caused some selling
of the dollar on Monday, faded into the background as he returned to work in
the White House.
Trading was subdued, on lack of economic factors, with the next important US
figures not due until Friday, when data on producer prices will be
published.
At the London close the dollar had fallen to DM1.7210 from Friday's DM1.7460
(DM1.7317 on Monday in New York); to Y137.95 from Y138.50 (Y138.25 in New
York); to SFr1.4580 from SFr1.4750 (SFr1.4675); and to FFr5.8275 from
FFr5.9150 (FFr5.8595). London was closed on Monday for a public holiday. The
Bank of England's dollar index fell 0.6 to 66.0.
Sterling was generally firmer, as the market took the view that last week's
poor performance by the UK's ruling Conservative party in local elections
had effectively cancelled the option of a general election next month.
Dealers do not expect an election before October at the earliest, and noted
that although wholesale interest rates in London discount a cut of  1/2
point in bank base rates there is little electoral reason for an immediate
reduction.
The Bank of England has given no encouragement to rate speculation, and has
underlined the present structure by lending to the money market at 12 per
cent on the last four Fridays.
Compared with Friday, sterling gained 2.60 cents to Dollars 1.7210. It also
climbed to DM2.9625 from DM2.9600; to FFr10.0300 from FFr10.0250; to
SFr2.5100 from SFr2.5000; and to Y237.50 from Y234.75. Its index rose 0.3 to
91.5. In New York, the pound ended 65 points higher at Dollars 1.7275.
In the European Exchange Rate Mechanism sterling improved to third from
fourth strongest, on figures from the European Commission.
The D-Mark was steady around the middle of the system, but lost a little
ground to the second strongest lira at the Milan fixing and to the weakest
placed French franc at the Paris fixing.
In terms of the Japanese currency the D-Mark showed a firmer tone, breaking
through resistance at Y80.00. It had improved to Y80.15 by the London close,
from Y79.85 on Monday in New York, and Y79.30 last Friday in London.
