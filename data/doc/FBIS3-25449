  [Text] Dakar, 17 Feb (AFP) -- Today, the opposition 
Coordination of Democratic Forces [CFD] shifted the blame on the 
Senegalese Government for the violent demonstrations that took 
place here yesterday and that resulted in five dead, including 
four policemen. In a communique issued here, the CFD accused 
the Senegalese Government of "provoking" opposition activists by 
barricading access routes to a public meeting and authorizing 
the security forces to use force against those who wanted to go 
there. 
  The CFD, which comprises five opposition parties, including 
the main opposition party -- Abdoulaye Wade's Senegalese 
Democratic Party -- expressed support for "the spontaneous 
decision by the masses to organize a protest march yesterday 
against the unspeakable and unjustified violations of the most 
basic freedom." 
  The demonstrations broke out after a public meeting 
organized 
by the opposition parties to condemn the negative effects of the 
11 January 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc on the 
people's standard of living. During the demonstrations, 
hundreds of youth swarmed into the city center, ransacking 
everything in their way and attacking the security forces who 
tried to contain them with teargas grenades.
