TALES FOR A SUMMER DAY 
Oh, the joy of feasting once again on a magazine of short stories ("Tales for a 
Summer Day," July 1). 
When I was growing up, such magazines as Liberty, Collier's and Saturday 
Evening Post were eagerly awaited and their short stories devoured upon 
arrival. 
Then such magazines disappeared, forever, we thought. Then Los Angeles Times 
Magazine brings back the days of my girlhood, and with such beautiful stories. 
None of that esoteric stuff I can hardly comprehend, but human stories about 
real people. 
Keep it up! Maybe the young people will come back to the pleasures of reading 
instead of their robotic TV watching.
