  [Text] New Defense Minister Reynaldo Andino Flores said 
that the possibility of eliminating the position of Armed Forces 
chief "is something that will have to be studied eventually." 
  Andino thus reacted to President Carlos Roberto Reina's 
statement to a local television station that the current 
historic moment demands changes in the military institution, 
including the possible elimination of that position. 
  He added, however, that he could not comment further on the 
subject as he had not heard Reina's statement. 
  Should that position be eliminated, Andino would assume 
leadership of the Armed Forces as defense minister. In that 
regard, he said: "I have been a soldier at the service of my 
country, and that is what I have always been wherever I have 
been assigned. Fortunately, all of my appointments have been 
important. I assume this post with the same satisfaction and 
with the desire to do my best." 
  He added that before eliminating the position of Armed 
Forces 
chief, "it should be studied first among political sectors, the 
Armed Forces, and Honduran leaders in order to make the decision 
that is best for the people. After all, we, the members of the 
Armed Forces, are part of the people." 
  Andino said that the post of commander in chief of the Armed 
Forces has its advantages in relation to the position of defense 
minister. He added, however, that "things are changing, and I 
believe that the position could continue to exist if it were 
updated, the necessary reforms were made, any negative aspects 
were corrected, and positive aspects highlighted.
