FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Santos advances to ADollars 64m
despite lower oil prices
SANTOS, the onshore Australian petroleum producer, has defied lower prices
with a 91 per cent rise in net earnings for the first half to June.
The South Australian-based company lifted net profits to ADollars 64.1m
(USDollars 46.1m) from ADollars 33.6m a year earlier, on a 15.8 per cent
rise in sales to ADollars 360.0m from ADollars 310.8m.
The interim dividend is being raised to 10 cents a share from 9 cents.
The directors said the average oil price received by the company eased to
ADollars 26.95 a barrel from ADollars 27.54, but this was offset by an 8.4
per cent advance in sales volume to 16.8m barrels of oil equivalent. Santos'
net debt increased to ADollars 784.8m from ADollars 755.0m, they said.
