SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES 
* Noting costs associated with a recent proxy fight and reserves resulting from 
a reevaluation of its assets, Oak Industries reported a $7.1-million loss on 
$50.6-million revenue for its second quarter ended June 30. 
The loss, which contrasts with a profit of $539,000 on revenue of $48.5 million 
for the same quarter last year, reflects a $2-million proxy expense, $945,000 
in corporate reorganization expense, including employee severance costs, and $2 
million for the reevaluation and required reserves. 
Oak also booked a $1.5-million expense from the operation and liquidation of 
the company's discontinued telephone advertising business. Oak's current 
management wrested control of the company in June after a victorious proxy 
fight. 
For the six months ended June 30, Oak's loss stands at $7.6 million on sales of 
$101.3 million, contrasted with a profit of $3.9 million on sales of $99.5 
million for the same period last year.
