  [Text] Taipei, May 31 (CNA) -- Most export processing zone 
(EPZ) manufacturers are optimistic about the export outlook in 
the second quarter of 1994, according to a survey conducted by 
the EPZ administration recently. 
  A total of 91 manufacturers in the EPZ, or 50 percent of 
those surveyed, said they thought exports will remain stable in 
the second quarter. This is up from 46 percent from a similar 
survey in the first quarter. 
  Fifty-nine manufacturers, or 33 percent, said they thought 
exports would take a turn for the better, higher than the 23 
percent in the first quarter. 
  However, 31 manufacturers, or 17 percent, thought exports 
would become worse. This is down from 31 percent in the 
previous quarter. 
  EPZ officials said this [words indistinct] on rising [words
