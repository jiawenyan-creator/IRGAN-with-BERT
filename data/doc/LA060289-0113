European sports ministers unanimously approved resolutions in Reykjavik, 
Iceland, that they hope will provide potent new tools in the fight against 
drugs. 
Representatives of the 23 Council of Europe nations adopted legislation calling 
for year-round drug testing of athletes and threatening penalties for doctors 
and coaches who supply banned substances to athletes. 
The resolutions will act as a guide for the 23 nations in their own efforts to 
fight drugs.
