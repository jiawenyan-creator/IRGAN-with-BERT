FT  09 NOV 93 / Turks to repair Moscow parliament
THE RUSSIAN government has awarded Gama Industry of Turkey a Dollars 17m
contract for the first phase of repairs to the White House in Moscow, the
parliamentary building blasted by tanks and gunfire during the anti-Yeltsin
rebellion a month ago.
Gama started work on the building within days of the rebellion ending on
October 4 but it only recently secured a contract.
'We started work with only a verbal agreement. There was no time to talk
about price and money, they wanted the work done quickly so we went ahead,'
Mr Ergil Ersu, Gama's managing director, said. 'It was in front of the whole
world's eyes, so we had to go ahead and trust our client.'
About 200 Gama construction workers were already in Russia working on other
projects.
Within a week, a further 500 had been flown from Turkey along with equipment
and tools. The company is repairing damage to the low-level section of the
White House.
