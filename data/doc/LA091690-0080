WOULD A HANDGUN BAN REALLY HAVE AVERTED DANA POINT DEATH? 
One Dana Point teen-ager is dead and his alleged 16-year-old assailant in jail, 
largely because of the lack of strict gun-control laws. 
Teens might normally settle severe arguments with a fistfight, perhaps ending 
with a couple of black eyes or, at worst, a few broken teeth. 
A gun-control law with real teeth in it might result in some lost teeth for 
teens, but not death and incarceration.
