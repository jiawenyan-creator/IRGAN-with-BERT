SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A recent review of the procedural rules in 39 CFR part 953 has revealed several references that require updating and
several provisions that require some rewording for further clarity. Moreover, the review has revealed that the rules
could be improved by expressing heretofore implicit requirements (e.g., in 953.17, the requirement to give
the Postal Service's General Counsel notice and the opportunity to respond when the appellant seeks return of matter
found to be nonmailable); by amplifying requirements that were incompletely expressed (e.g., in 953.4, specifying
the steps required for effecting service of notice when the appellant's address is outside the United States; and
in 953.16, specifying ways in which the hearing process may be expedited); and by expressly authorizing summary
judgment to dispose of cases presenting no genuine and material issues of fact. 


Most of the sections in part 953 have been changed or modified. Section 953.5, concerning the reply to be made by the
General Counsel, is moved to 953.4; the sections following the expanded 953.4 are consequently renumbered.
The text of 953.1, concerning authority for the rules, 953.14, concerning appeal from an initial decision,
and 953.18, concerning ex parte communications, is carried forward unchanged in the revised rules.
