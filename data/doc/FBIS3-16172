  [Text] The volumes of procurements of arms, military 
equipment, and defense scientific and design developments will 
be preserved in 1994 in the volumes determined by the 
government's decision dated last December 21. Interfax has 
learned that this decision was adopted at a conference chaired 
by Russia's First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets on Friday. The 
Finance Ministry was proposed to foresee an appropriate level of 
military order financing before sending the state budget to the 
State Duma. 
  Conference participants pointed out that a sharp reduction 
of 
defense orders would result in unrecoverable consequences for 
the country's defense potential and would necessitate social 
compensation payments in accordance with the legislature. As 
participants of the conference note, they will exceed possible 
economy from the reduction of the defense order planned earlier 
by Rbs [Rubles] 2-3 Tn [Trillion]. 
  The conference particularly considered the proposal of the 
First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin on the mechanism 
to end the crisis in defense enterprises, which also produce 
civilian products.
