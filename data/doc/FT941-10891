FT  07 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Total - Other companies
Also on Wednesday, France's other oil giant, which is already in the private
sector, will announce estimates of its results for last year. Unlike Elf,
which saw a sharp fall in profits, Total is expected to announce results
similar to 1992 when it reported net income of FFr2.85bn (Dollars 500m).
Like other companies in the sector, Total has suffered from the fall in the
oil price. The company said last December that it would take an exceptional
charge of about FFr800m relating to the impact of the oil price decline.
