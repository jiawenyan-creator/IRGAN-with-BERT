LAW OF ECONOMICS PLAYS HAVOC WITH STATE'S MEDI-CAL PROGRAM 
The editorial "Medi-Cal Rejection in County Shameful" (July 29) was too 
simplistic in its presentation. You made it seem like it is the fault of 
doctors and hospitals that there is inadequate health care for Medi-Cal 
recipients in our county; yet, I have never heard you claim that it is the 
fault of landlords and developers that we have homelessness. 
The subject of Medi-Cal contracting with hospitals is complex and 
non-intuitive. It may well be that Fountain Valley Regional Hospital will 
continue to serve Medi-Cal patients at a higher reimbursement rate without a 
Medi-Cal contract than with one. 
I understand that the state planners have seriously considered canceling all 
Medi-Cal contracts in Orange County so that each hospital will have to take its 
share of Medi-Cal patients. Many of these hospitals will receive a higher 
Medi-Cal rate without a contract than with one. 
Another large Orange County hospital has just signed a Medi-Cal contract. The 
medical staff at that hospital is concerned that a large number of Medi-Cal 
recipients may inundate their facility once the word gets out about the 
contract, creating another Fountain Valley situation. 
The fact is that many physicians do treat Medi-Cal patients; we just do not 
advertise the fact. Doctors are concerned that a reputation of accepting 
Medi-Cal patients may have a negative impact on their colleagues and private 
patients. 
Today's problems of poverty, medical indigence and homelessness were not 
created by the medical community, and these problems will not be solved by that 
community alone.
