MAN GIVES UP AFTER BARRICADING HOUSE 
A 75-year-old man apparently despondent over medical problems barricaded 
himself in his Castaic house for 4 1/2 hours and fired at least two shots 
before surrendering Friday afternoon, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department reported. 
Jack Neely was taken to Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar for a 72-hour 
psychiatric observation after he walked out the front door of his house with 
his hands above his head about 4:30 p.m., authorities said. 
His wife, Martha Neely, left the house in the 31600 block of Cherry Drive about 
noon to call for help after he fired a handgun at the ceiling, Lt. Dennis Burns 
said. No one was hit, Burns said. 
Sheriff's deputies arrived shortly afterward and called for the sheriff's 
Special Weapons Team and Crisis Negotiation Team, which arrived about 2 p.m., 
authorities said. Neely gave himself up after a negotiator asked him repeatedly 
over a loudspeaker to come out of the house, a witness said. 
Sheriff's Sgt. Ernie Roop said Neely was depressed over heart problems and a 
recent bout with emphysema. He has no history of violent behavior or run-ins 
with law enforcement, Roop said.
