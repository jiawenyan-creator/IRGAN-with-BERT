FT  13 OCT 94 / Technology: Better than a boring bike
Exercise machines are hard work and time-consuming. They are also boring,
which is why health clubs are turning to virtual reality. A US manufacturer
has designed an exercise bike that allows the rider to interact with a
virtual reality world displayed on the screen, using a colour monitor at eye
level and thumb-controls in the handlebars.
The interactive, three- dimensional graphics give the exerciser the
impression of steering along bike paths, going up hills and entering
buildings. The illusion is limited, partly because the screen picture is a
cartoon-like representation and partly because it uses a monitor, which
covers 60 per cent of the users' field of vision.
Head-mounted displays allow greater vision, but if used for more than 20
minutes they can make people feel dizzy. Moreover, the designers considered
that putting on a head-mounted display that had recently been used by
someone else taking vigorous exercise was unappealing.
The machine creates some illusions by, for instance, allowing the rider to
lean left or right into turns and by changing the feel of the pedals,
depending on the terrain. It also blows a stream of air across the face,
which becomes stronger as the rider pedals faster.
The thumb-operated controls allow the rider to shift gears, brake, count
miles and view progress on a map. The VRBike can be linked to several
machines, so riders can exercise in groups or in competition.
CyberGear of Cambridge, Massachusetts, designed the software, which is
stored on a compact disc. The suppliers intend to develop discs with other
landscapes.
The bike, which was launched at a price of Dollars 8,000 (Pounds 5,330) in
the US in June, will be available in the UK at the start of next year. The
manufacturers are Tectrix Fitness Equipment of Irvine in California.
