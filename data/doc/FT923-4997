FT  03 SEP 92 / International Company News: State-owned Swedish bank names
chairman
NORDBANKEN, Sweden's loss-making state-owned bank, yesterday appointed a new
chairman. Mr Jacob Palmstierna, the current deputy, will take over from Mr
Bjorn Wahlstrom who has is leaving the bank.
Mr Palmstierna will work closely with the bank's chief executive Mr Hans
Dahlborg who remains in his post.
Mr Palmstierna said that the restructuring of Nordbanken should pave the way
for its privatisation. At the beginning of next year around SKr60bn (Dollars
11.2bn) of its risk-related loans and debts will be removed from its balance
sheet and placed in a new state-owned company called Securum. The bank has a
loan portfolio of SKr250bn.
However, the disappearance of the worst credit loss problems from the bank
will enable it to concentrate on becoming more domestically based, to appeal
more strongly to private customers, the public sector and small and
medium-sized companies.
Mr Palmstierna said the bank would not be ripe for privatising in 1993 and
it would need 'five to six quarters of profitable operations' before it
could be considered to have returned to viability.
In the first four months of the year it made an operating loss of SKr1.970bn
following a deficit of SKr5.8bn in 1991.
The bank has received SKr20bn of Swedish taxpayers' money to help it stem
the flow of losses due to bad loans in real estate speculation.
The bank plans to cut its 6,500 staff by 1,400 over the next 18 months. Its
cost-saving measures are designed to ensure it maintains strong capital
ratios.
Mr Palmstierna, when chief executive of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken,
Sweden's largest commercial bank, where he had spent his banking career, was
charged with tax evasion.
Although cleared of the charge, he was forced to resign from SEB.
