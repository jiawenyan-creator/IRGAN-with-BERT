  [Text] The leader of the Afrikaner Volksfront [National 
Front], General Constand Viljoen, has provisionally registered a 
party called the Freedom Front for the coming election. The 
step came only hours after the leader of the IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party], Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, had provisionally 
registered his party. 
  Gen. Viljoen said he had realized after the IFP decision 
that 
the freedom of the Afrikaner people to exercise their options 
would be limited if he did not apply for provisional 
registration. He said participation in the election would 
depend on whether negotiations or international mediation 
delivered the desired results. 
  Gen. Viljoen said the Volksraad [National Assembly] would 
decide in Pretoria today whether the Freedom Front would 
participate in the election. The party has until 1200 [1000 
GMT] this afternoon to make any changes to the party's name. 
  A spokesman for the IFP, Miss Sue Vos, said a final decision 
on the IFP's participation in the election would depend on a 
meeting of the Freedom Alliance on Monday [7 March], and talks 
with the ANC [African National Congress] on Tuesday. 
  Parties participating in the election have until 4:30 
Wednesday afternoon to confirm their participation by submitting 
the names of their candidates. 
  The chief negotiator for Bophuthatswana, Mr. Rowan Cronje, 
says Bophuthatswana could consider participating in the election 
if the deadline for registration is extended. 
  The leader of the National Party, Mr. F. W. de Klerk, has 
welcomed the IFP's decision to register provisionally for the 
election. However, he said that he regretted that there were 
conditions attached to the IFP's participation.
