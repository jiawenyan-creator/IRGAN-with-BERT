FT  06 FEB 92 / Cash cushion from sale of silverware: American Express's
attempt to raise Dollars 1bn by floating division
American Express is not a bank, but the US travel and financial services
giant has been afflicted by some of the same kind of heavy credit losses as
many big US banks. The answer at American Express, as at big banks such as
Citicorp, is to try to bolster capital.
This week's decision by American Express to try to raise up to Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 553m) by floating off a chunk of its credit card processing division
 -one of the group's five main subsidiary operations - does not therefore
suggest a strategic shift at the financial services and travel group.
Rather, the fund-raising plan says more about the group's need for a cash
cushion at a time of great uncertainty in the US financial services sector.
The equity offer, one of the largest American Express fund raising exercises
in years, comes after a difficult 1991 for the core Travel Related Services
(TRS) division, which includes the plastic card and travellers cheque
businesses. TRS reported a Dollars 697m pre-tax increase in its credit loss
provisions last year, and a 59 per cent slump in net income to Dollars 396m.
More than 50 per cent of TRS's 1991 loss provisions resulted from losses at
its troubled Optima credit card division. The Optima losses appeared to
result from poor credit risk judgments, and a management reshuffle was
instituted last autumn to deal with the problem.
Yesterday, American Express unveiled a relaunch of the Optima card which
includes a three-tiered pricing structure that rewards customers with good
credit behaviour.
The credit losses at Optima and elsewhere are also a sign of the US
recession. This is why the comparison of American Express with banks is not
at all far-fetched - American Express is a financial services group that in
1991 had worldwide charge card volume of Dollars 111bn and Dollars 23bn of
travellers cheque sales.
A fundamental difference is that banks are forced by US capital adequacy
rules to maintain certain capital ratios whereas for American Express the
external discipline comes from the market. The judgment of credit rating
agencies such as Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's may therefore have a greater
effect on the group's need to maintain capital strength in order to raise
funds on the market.
Both of these credit rating agencies downgraded American Express long-term
debt last year, with S&amp;P nudging its rating down from AA to AA- last July
and Moody's reducing its rating from Aa2 to A1 in November. The latter move
followed the news of credit losses at Optima.
While several Wall Street analysts believe TRS earnings will recover in line
with the US economy, most doubt that TRS will achieve the kind of rapid
growth it experienced in the 1980s.
Mr John Keefe of Lipper Analytical Services says the new equity offer plan
is one way for American Express 'to strengthen their equity to show they
continue to be a strong company and to improve their credit rating so they
can borrow more to fund card operations'.
But Mr Keefe notes that in selling up to 45 per cent of the card processing
division, American Express 'is raising money by selling some of its family
silverware'.
The silverware in question is a division until now called Information
Services Corporation (ISC) but its name is being changed for the public
share offer to First Data Corporation to reflect the largest part of ISC,
the First Data Resources card processing unit.
First Data Resources, which is the largest third-party card processor in the
US and in the UK, accounted for about half of ISC's 1991 net profit of
Dollars 118m and revenues of Dollars 995m. The company was enlarged last
summer with the Pounds 146m purchase of the Basildon-based Signet card
processor in the UK, which helped boost 1991 revenues by 20 per cent. The
card processing business accounts for some 7,000 of ISC's 17,000 employees.
Although calculations of the value of floating up to 45 per cent of ISC on
the stock market - which suggests a total market capitalisation of Dollars
1.8bn to Dollars 2bn - are based on earnings multiples related to the card
processing business, ISC is more than just card processing.
The company also includes a money order and payment systems operation,
information management systems for US hospitals, telephone operator services
and telemarketing, billing services for cable television companies and
inter-active phone systems that are part of a joint venture with American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
American Express declines to provide a breakdown of the profitability of
these businesses, but says all were in the black last year.
American Express first bought the company now known as ISC in 1980, when it
paid Dollars 50m to acquire First Data Resources which had Dollars 54m of
revenues that year. The company was then developed by a string of small and
medium-sized acquisitions.
Between 1983 and 1985 some of First Data's shares were shuttled on and off
the stock market by American Express. In 1983, Dollars 60m was raised by the
flotation of 25 per cent of First Data; two years later American Express
bought back the shares for Dollars 250m.
By 1989, the operations of First Data, then a part of the TRS division, were
reshuffled inside the group and it became a free-standing division known as
ISC. Since 1989 the division has lifted earnings steadily.
While analysts say there may be some logic in bringing back outside
shareholders, the consensus is that the upcoming share offer is simply a
cash-raising tool. Mr Jim Robinson, American Express chairman, expressed as
much when he said the funds would come 'at a time when a strong capital base
is especially important for financial services companies'.
An aide to Mr Robinson summed up the fundraising exercise in terms that any
US banker or corporate executive can appreciate: 'Cash is king.'
