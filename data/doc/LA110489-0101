METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SAUGUS TEACHERS, DISTRICT DRAFT TENTATIVE 
PACT 
Teachers and administrators in the Saugus Union Elementary School District said 
Friday that they have drafted a tentative agreement to end their contract 
dispute. 
The agreement, reached late Thursday with the aid of a state mediator, 
apparently ends a tense six weeks in the fast-growing Santa Clarita Valley 
school district. 
Teachers staged several protests during the talks. 
Although the current contract was not scheduled to expire for two years, 
passage of a statewide school funding initiative last fall prompted the 
teachers to return to the bargaining table. Jo Ann Pryor, president of the 
Saugus Teachers Assn., said the contract allows negotiations to reopen when new 
state funds become available. 
The agreement would give the teachers a 4% raise this year and a 1% raise for 
the 1990-91 school year, Pryor said. The increases will be in addition to a 6% 
raise that the teachers were to receive this year and a 6% raise set for next 
year. 
The 214-member union is scheduled to vote on the agreement Wednesday.
