</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission accepts for consideration the application filed September 30, 1994, by Canadian Pacific Limited,
Canadian Pacific (U.S.) Holdings Inc., Soo Line Corporation, and Soo Line Railroad Company (Soo) (collectively,
applicants). Soo and Burlington Northern Railroad Company (BN) own the Davenport, Rock Island and North Western
Railway Company (DRI) jointly. Soo seeks to acquire sole control of DRI as a prelude to merging DRI into Soo. DRI lines
east of the Mississippi River will be transferred to BN, and lines west of the Mississippi River (and BN's ownership
interest in a joint BN/Soo line) will be transferred to Soo. Soo's East Moline-Albany line (east of the Mississippi
River) will also be transferred to BN. DRI will cease to exist. Under 49 CFR part 1180, the Commission finds this to be
a minor transaction.
