FT  10 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lost customers kept hanging on the
telephone
Sir, In your article 'Ringing the tills' (December 8) you comment that one
in five customers phoning shops for information failed to get through at the
first attempt.
This company has just carried out a survey of more than 5,000 UK businesses,
which revealed that 33 per cent failed to answer their phones. This implies
that one in three businesses around the country are unwittingly turning away
potential customers every day of the week.
However, the survey revealed that not all businesses are unhelpful - 36 per
cent manage to answer their phones within two or three rings. More
impressive yet was the fact that 4.8 per cent pick up their phones within
just one ring.
The telephone is often the first point of contact between supplier and
customer, and companies should make sure their staff are trained properly to
answer calls promptly and politely.
