"Russian Industry in January 1994: A Forecast"] 
  [Text] In appraising the situation in Russian 
industry in January 1994, we have first and foremost to take 
into account that, first, there are only 19 working days in this 
month; second, that many enterprises have decided to extend the 
New Year holidays to 10 January; third, that most enterprises 
have not yet signed contracts for deliveries of raw materials, 
fuels, parts, and components for 1994 and deliveries of finished 
products; and fourth, that the level of production in January 
1993 was extremely low, which will make it possible for a number 
of production sectors to surpass this level in 1994 while still 
not reaching the level of 1992, let alone 1989. 
  Production of more than 80 percent of varieties of the 
output 
produced will decline in a majority of sectors. An especially 
significant decline in output (by more than 20 percent) will 
take place in a number of sectors in the metallurgical complex; 
machine building; the chemical industry; the timber, 
woodworking, and pulp and paper industry; production of complex 
home appliances; and light industry and the food processing 
industry. 
  The index of the physical volume of industrial production 
will measure in January at 0.854 in Russia as a whole (in 
November it measured 0.847, as compared to the forecasted value 
of 0.853--see DELOVOY MIR, 10 November 1993); that is, 
production will decline by 14.6 percent. The average daily 
volume of production will decline by 16.8 percent as compared to 
January 1993 (in November it declined by 17.3 percent as 
compared to the forecasted 16.7 percent--see DELOVOY MIR, 10 
November 1993). 
  In continuation of the trend of the second half of 1993, 
enterprises' financial instability caused by the payments crisis 
remains the most important factor causing production decline. 
  For instance, according to a Goskomstat [State Committee on 
Statistics] of Russia report, as of 1 November 1993 past due 
arrears on the part of customers in paying their suppliers 
amounted to 6.371 trillion rubles [R] and increased over the 
month by 22.3 percent. In December, according to preliminary 
estimates, past due arrears also increased. There is no reason 
to assume that the volume of past due arrears will stop 
increasing in January 1994. Moreover, one may predict with a 
high degree of certainty that it will increase. 
  If we look at expected volumes of main categories of energy 
resources (see table), one may get the impression that the 
situation emerging in the fuels and power generation sector in 
January 1994 is somewhat better than that in January 1993. 
  And it is true that electric power generation at 
general-use power stations will increase by 1.2 billion kw/hr (1 
percent) as compared to January 1993. This entire increase will 
come from increased power output at nuclear power stations--by 9 
percent. Power output at thermal and hydroelectric power 
stations will remain at the 1993 level. In the total volume of 
power generation, the share of its output generated by thermal 
power stations will decrease from 72.3 percent in January 1993 
to 71.6 percent in January 1994; at hydroelectric power 
stations--from 15.8 percent to 15.6 percent; and at nuclear 
power stations it will increase from 11.9 percent to 12.8 
percent. One may hardly say in all seriousness, however, that 
production decline in electric power generation will be halted 
and growth will begin. As already noted above, the level of 
January 1993, against which comparisons are being made, was 
extremely low, and therefore this only appears to be going well. 
If we compare electric power generation forecasted for January 
1994 with the volume produced in January 1989, we will see a 
10-percent decline instead of growth. 
  Oil production will decline as compared to January 1993 by 
3.5 million tonnes (12 percent) and will amount to 26.2 million 
tonnes. This will be precipitated to a considerable extent by a 
decline in production in Tyumen Oblast (by more than 13 
percent), which accounts for almost two-thirds of the entire oil 
production in Russia. 
  The decline in the volume of oil production will lead to a 
7-percent drop in primary oil refining, which will cause a 
decline in the production of automotive gasoline by 14 percent, 
diesel fuel--by 13 percent, and boiler oil--by 9 percent. It 
should be noted that the depth of oil processing declined 
somewhat in 1993 and measured at 62.8 percent as compared to 
63.9 percent in 1992. 
  In the gas industry, the volume of production in 
January 1994 will drop off by 2 percent and will amount to 56 
billion cubic meters. The trend of a decline in gas production, 
which has manifested itself since May 1993, had been caused to a 
considerable extent by the insolvency of many consumers in the 
near abroad countries. In appears that this trend will continue 
in 1994, at least through the first half of it. Because of the 
lack of money, the volume of work on construction of surface 
facilities at Urengoy, Yamburg, and other fields has been 
curtailed considerably, which probably will affect the state of 
affairs in the industry in the beginning of 1994. 
  The coal industry began to gradually pull out of a 
pre-strike state, in which it had lingered for more than a month 
and a half (in the beginning of December, a three-day strike 
took place in Vorkuta). The industry's instability in 1993 will 
produce aftereffects in the first half of 1994 as well. An 
especially great impact on the state of affairs in coal basins 
comes from very substantial arrears in consumer payments for 
coal already shipped, which is unlikely to diminish in the 
beginning of the year. Overall, in January coal production will 
amount to 26.9 million tonnes (99 percent of the 1993 level). 
Production of coking coal will increase over the month by 4 
percent. 
  The level of production in ferrous metallurgy in 
January 1994 will be affected the most by the shortage of raw 
materials and fuel resources. Iron ore production will decline 
by 5 percent. Scrap metal deliveries will amount to no more than 
50-55 percent of normal needs. Coke burning will decline by 12 
percent, despite the fact that the output of coking coal will 
increase, as already noted above. Because of metallurgical 
enterprises' considerable arrears in paying coal producers, the 
latter are in no hurry to ship coal to consumers. The state of 
affairs in the sector also will be affected by a reduced demand 
for metallurgical output on the part of the machine building 
industry, the VPK [military-industrial complex], and the 
construction complex. As a result, in January 1994 pig iron 
smelting will fall off by 20 percent, that of steel--by 22 
percent, production of finished rolled metal--by 16 percent, and 
steel pipe--by 49 percent. In continuation of the 1993 trend, 
production of many advanced varieties of metal products will 
continue to decline, since the demand for them is steadily 
declining because of extremely high prices. 
  The situation in machine building in January 1994 
will be extremely hard. Over the past months there has been a 
tremendous decline in solvent demand for many--first and 
foremost science-intensive--varieties of output. For instance, 
production of metal-cutting machine tools and drop forges with 
the numeric program control over 11 months of 1993 declined by a 
factor of four to six, since prices for these items increased 
several-fold while qualitative characteristics remained the 
same. The industry is in an extremely difficult financial 
situation: As of 1 November, customers owed to machinebuilding 
enterprises R1.2721 trillion. 
  Production decline will occur with respect to most varieties 
of the output produced. For instance, the output of 
metal-cutting machine tools will drop off by 41 percent, drop 
forges--by 57 percent, spinning machines--by 13 percent, 
looms--by 17 percent, bulldozers--by 41 percent, excavators--by 
13 percent, main line freight railcars--by 80 percent, main line 
passenger railcars--by 44 percent, trolley buses--by 28 percent, 
trucks--by 34 percent, buses--by 11 percent, tractors--by 76 
percent, tractor-drawn attachments--by 84 percent, grain 
harvesting combines--by 76 percent, and friction-free ball 
bearings--by 52 percent. 
  The situation with respect to production of main line 
electric locomotives should be noted separately. In 1993 there 
have been months when not a single main line electric locomotive 
was produced. We forecast a similar situation for January 1994, 
with zero output of electric locomotives. 
  As before, production of passenger cars will be on a rise: 
In 
January, it will increase by 1 percent. Also, the output of main 
line diesel locomotives will double. 
  In the chemical and petrochemical industry in 
January 1994 the situation will continue to worsen. Because of 
the difficult financial situation (as of 1 November customers 
owed the industry enterprises R1.0195 trillion) and shortage of 
components and raw materials, including those obtained through 
imports, production of most varieties of the output produced 
will continue to decline. This will affect first and foremost 
the output of most important producer products. For instance, 
the output of synthetic ammonia will drop off by 16 percent; 
sulfuric acid, by 25 percent; calcinated soda, by 49 percent; 
and caustic soda, by 22 percent. 
  Production of mineral fertilizer continues to 
decline; its output will fall off by 24 percent in January. 
Financial difficulties experienced by enterprises because of 
nonpayment on the part of consumers, shortage of mineral and 
chemical raw materials resulting from depletion of mineral 
reserves, the decline in demand caused by rapidly rising prices, 
as well as a number of other reasons have led to a steady 
decline in production over a lengthy period of time, which is 
unlikely to be overcome in the near future. 
  The output of chemical thread and fiber will 
decline by 30 percent. 
  A difficult situation exists at enterprises producing 
microbiological fodder protein, whose output will 
decline in January by 46 percent. Enterprises producing 
microbiological fodder protein out of oil hydrocarbons and 
timber material were on the verge of stoppage at the end of the 
year. 
  The situation is unlikely to improve in the timber, 
woodworking, and pulp and paper industry. So far, attempts 
to stabilize the situation with respect to supply of timber 
input materials to woodworking sector enterprises have been 
unsuccessful. At the end of 1993, timber logging enterprise so 
far have been unable to take advantage of the most favorable 
period for logging. The outtake of round timber continues to 
decline, to the point of 33 percent in January, which will lead 
to a 35-percent reduction in the output of commercial wood. 
Shortage of raw timber necessitates cutbacks in the production 
of sawn lumber, which will decline by 32 percent; plywood which 
will decline by 29 percent; wood-chip board--by 11 percent; 
paper--by 15 percent; and cardboard--by 30 percent. 
  In the construction materials industry a certain 
pick-up has been observed over the past several months. It is 
related to a considerable extent to a rise in individual housing 
construction, which resulted in an increased demand for cement, 
construction brick, etc. In January the output of cement will 
increase as compared to 1993 by 11 percent; asbestos-cement pipe 
and couplings, by 50 percent; and pliable roofing materials, by 
4 percent. The output of construction brick will remain at the 
1993 level. In this respect, we have to keep in mind that in 
January 1993 the output of many varieties of products was 
extremely low. Therefore, an increase in the output of some or 
other product in January 1994 as compared to January 1993 does 
not always signal a trend of overcoming the decline. At the same 
time, the output of preassembled ferroconcrete will decline by 
12 percent; construction brick, by 10 percent; asbestos-cement 
sheeting, by 30 percent; and window glass, by 22 percent. 
  In January 1994 the trend toward a decline in the output of 
most categories of complex home appliances will 
persist. Production of washing machines will decline by 35 
percent; electric vacuum cleaners, by 46 percent; tape 
recorders, by 40 percent; radio receivers, by 36 percent; sewing 
machines, by 60 percent; and bicycles, by 48 percent. The output 
of television sets, which had increased in 1993 over several 
months, will drop off in January by 14 percent. And only the 
output of refrigerators and freezers will increase, by 10 
percent. 
  To a considerable extent, the decline in the output of home 
appliances stems from the diminished demand for it, due to high 
prices and the fact that imported goods of higher quality are 
widely available. 
  In light industry production of cotton fabrics 
will continue to rise in January, increasing overall by 71 
percent. This is contingent on the assumption that the contracts 
for cotton deliveries from Central Asia will be fulfilled. As to 
the demand for items made of cotton fabric, it is quite stable. 
Production of other most important industry products will 
continue to decline, however: woolen fabrics, by 32 percent; 
silk fabrics, by 27 percent; knitwear, by 16 percent; hosiery, 
by 2 percent; and footwear, by 26 percent.
