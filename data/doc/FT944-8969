FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Capital may seek all four regional licences
Capital Radio, the largest company in the commercial radio sector, said
yesterday that it might apply for all four of the regional licences to be
advertised by the Radio Authority.
The suggestion came from Mr Richard Eyre, Capital's managing director, as he
announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 22.2m (Pounds 11.7m), including Pounds
4.23m from the disposal of operations, for the year to September 30.
Capital would be unlikely to win all of the new licences covering 7m people
in the Yorkshire area, East Anglia, the east Midlands and the Solent, but
its interest shows a determination to expand.
Capital,which has stations in Birmingham and the south of England as well as
London, also made it clear yesterday that it was interested in major
conurbations and that new licences were unlikely to satisfy its ambitions.
Under the points system for limiting the concentration of station ownership,
Capital has the leeway to buy a number of new licences or even a national
commercial station in the unlikely event that one became available.
Mr Eyre ruled out diversification outside the radio industry.
Capital, which said its stations were now all number one in their markets,
increased annual turnover by 44 per cent to Pounds 51.7m (Pounds 36m). The
increase included the effect of acquisitions and disposals.
Earnings per share more than doubled to 22.8p (11.3p). The final dividend of
5p makes a total of 7.25p (5.75p) for the year.
Mr Ian Irvine, chairman, said yesterday the new financial year had begun
well. He conceded, however, that staff costs had risen as more people had
been taken on for the sales organisation, Media Sales &amp; Marketing.
