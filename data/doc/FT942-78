FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Krupp Hoesch reduces interim
loss to DM50m
Krupp Hoesch, Germany's second-largest steelmaker, yesterday said it lost
DM50m (Dollars 30.6m) in the first six months of this year, compared with a
loss of DM324m in the same period the year before, but remained confident it
would break even this year.
The Essen-based group lost DM590m last year, dragged down by a DM780m loss
in the steel division and a small loss at the engineering unit.
Most of the half-year losses came from the steel division, the only one of
the group's six divisions not making a profit, but the company said these
losses would be 'considerably lower' for the full year.
Orders in the first five months were up 12 per cent on the previous year,
and sales had increased by 5 per cent over the same period, Mr Gerhard
Cromme, chief executive, told the annual meeting.
As part of ongoing restructuring, the steel division, which represented
about 35 per cent of 1993 sales, was last week broken up into four separate
companies, each focusing on different steel products.
