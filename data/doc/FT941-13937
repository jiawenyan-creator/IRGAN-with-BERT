FT  22 JAN 94 / Markets: Barclays charges move - At a glance
Barclays is to give personal customers advance notice of charges on their
bank accounts, although no date has yet been set for the process to start.
This gives customers time to query charges before they are imposed, and
helps stop people going unintentionally overdrawn because of charges.
Barclays has been pre-notifying business customers for some time. Some other
high street banks, including NatWest, already give their customers advance
warning of charges, and it is likely to become a requirement under a new
banking code of practice. Lloyds recently announced it would introduce the
practice.
