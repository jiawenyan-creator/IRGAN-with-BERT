  [Text] The imam of the al-Aqsa Mosque has expressed his 
appreciation for the message by His Eminence Ayatollah 
Khamene'i, the Guardian of the Muslims' cause, in condemnation 
of the Zionists' crime at the shrine of Prophet Abraham, peace 
be upon him. 
  According to IRNA in Beirut, Shaykh Hamid al-Bitawi stressed 
yesterday that the Islamic Republic of Iran supports the 
tyrannized Palestinian nation and eschews international 
political games. Reports received indicate the message issued by 
His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i condemning the atrocity of the 
Zionists was translated in Arabic and disseminated in occupied 
Palestine.
