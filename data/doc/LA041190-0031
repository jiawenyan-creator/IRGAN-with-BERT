VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS; 
TREE PLANTING TO HONOR ANNIVERSARY 
Although Thousand Oaks' 25th anniversary was actually in October, 25 trees are 
being planted in a belated celebration at the interchange of the Moorpark and 
Ventura freeways. 
Originally, the trees were slated by the City Council to be planted during the 
anniversary, but the planting was delayed until the state issued a permit. 
The interchange is owned by the state. 
The trees will be dedicated as part of the Earth Day ceremonies April 22. 
Thousand Oaks Mayor Fiore and Mayor Pro Tem Frank Schillo will perform the 
ceremony at California Lutheran University, beginning at 10 a.m. 
The first 300 people who arrive for the ceremonies will receive starter trees 
of various types. A bag of garden mulch will also be provided.
