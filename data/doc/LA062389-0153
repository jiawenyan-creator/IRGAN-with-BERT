LOCAL; 
2 ESCAPED CONVICTS LEAD OFFICERS ON FAST CHASE THROUGH SOUTHLAND 
Two escaped convicts from Michigan led law enforcement officers on a high-speed 
chase from Bakersfield through Orange County to San Pedro before their car, 
reportedly stolen, ran out of gasoline this morning. 
The black Cadillac sped over Interstate 5 at speeds of up to 120 m.p.h. but 
cruised most of the way to Dana Point at about 70, Los Angeles Police Lt. Tom 
Scheidecker said. The pair then turned north on Pacific Coast Highway through 
the beach cities before the 180-mile chase ended about 3 a.m. 
It was only after the Cadillac ran out of gas that Los Angeles police officers 
discovered the pair had escaped from a prison in Pontiac, Mich., Scheidecker 
said. 
A California Highway Patrol unit that had begun the chase was forced to stop 
for gas in Santa Ana, he said. Officers from other agencies, including the Los 
Angeles Sheriff's Department and police departments in Anaheim, Costa Mesa, 
Huntington Beach, Long Beach and Signal Hill, assisted in the chase.
