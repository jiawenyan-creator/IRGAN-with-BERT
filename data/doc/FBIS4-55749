  [Text] A new proposal to broaden political cooperation 
between the EU [European Union] and Poland has probably been 
brought to Warsaw by EU Commission President Jacques Delors. 
However, he will not reveal the details until tomorrow, after 
ending talks with Polish politicians. 
  [Correspondent] Delors's proposals will be a response to 
earlier suggestions by Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski. The 
Polish foreign minister sees a possibility of speeding up 
Poland's integration into the EU, particularly in the areas of 
security, foreign policy, and legislation. Delors himself said 
yesterday that he could see our country in the EU by the end of 
the century. He wonders, however, whether the Polish economy 
will stand up to direct confrontation with the West European 
economy. 
  Delors did not want to reveal the details of his proposals 
yet. I have come here to listen to Polish opinions. Our 
cooperation is developing well, nevertheless. We already have 
the association agreement, after all. 
  The EU Commission president admitted, however, that he 
wanted 
primarily to discuss Central European matters in Warsaw. [video
