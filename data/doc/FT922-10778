FT  29 APR 92 / World Trade News: Brussels disputes Gatt panel view in
Airbus row
THE EC said yesterday it could not accept the legal reasoning behind the
condemnation by a Gatt disputes panel in January of exchange rate guarantees
to the German arm of Airbus Industrie.
However, EC officials told Gatt's subsidies committee, which was discussing
the panel's report for the first time yesterday, that the exchange rates
scheme was suspended at the beginning of this year.
The US brought a complaint to Gatt last year as part of its wrangle with the
EC over state support for the four-nation Airbus project. It claims the
German scheme led to Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.4m) export subsidy for each of
95 aircraft delivered in 1990.
Bonn suspended the scheme for claims after January 15 1992, but it will stay
in place until the contract with Deutsche Airbus, now owned by Daimler Benz,
is renegotiated.
The mechanism, designed to compensate losses incurred by Deutsche Airbus for
a drop in the dollar's value against the D-Mark, was introduced in 1989 to
sweeten the privatisation deal involving the merger of Daimler Benz with
Messerschmidt-Bolkau-Blohm (MBB).
The US, backed by Japan and Canada, called yesterday for immediate adoption
of the panel's report. However, the EC said the panel's argument was partial
because it ignored provisions governing support for the industry in Gatt's
civil aircraft code.
It denied the exchange rate scheme was an export subsidy, saying it affected
only Deutsche Airbus' financial position, not the competitive position of
Airbus aircraft in the world market.
The panel ruled the scheme constituted an export subsidy on deliveries of
fuselages from Germany to France, but the EC said trade between EC member
states did not constitute an export. The subsidies committee will consider
the panel report at its next meeting.
