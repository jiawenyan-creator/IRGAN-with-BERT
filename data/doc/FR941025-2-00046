During the week of August 8 through August 12, 1994, the proposed decisions and orders summarized below were issued

Under the procedural regulations that apply to exception proceedings (10 CFR Part 205, Subpart D), any person who
will be aggrieved by the issuance of a proposed decision and order in final form may file a written notice of objection
within ten days of service. For purposes of the procedural regulations, the date of service of notice is deemed to be
the date of publication of this Notice or the date an aggrieved person receives actual notice, whichever occurs first.
The procedural regulations provide that an aggrieved party who fails to file a Notice of Objection within the time
period specified in the regulations will be deemed to consent to the issuance of the proposed decision and order in
final form. An aggrieved party who wishes to contest a determination made in a proposed decision and order must also
file a detailed statement of objections within 30 days of the date of service of the proposed decision and order. In
the statement of objections, the aggrieved party must specify each issue of fact or law that it intends to contest in
any further proceeding involving the exception matter.
Copies of the full text of these proposed decisions and orders are available in the Public Reference Room of the Office
of Hearings and Appeals, Room 1E234, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C.
