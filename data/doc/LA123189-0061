ALLA BREVE: WAGNER: "TANNHAUSER." CHERYL STUDER, AGNES BALTSA, PLACIDO DOMINGO, 
ANDREAS SCHMIDT, MATTI SALMINEN; CHORUS OF THE ROYAL OPERA HOUSE, COVENT 
GARDEN; PHILHARMONIA ORCHESTRA CONDUCTED BY GIUSEPPE SINOPOLI. DEUTSCHE 
GRAMMOPHON 427 625-2 (THREE COMPACT DISCS). 
Even if this were not the first recording in 20 years of the revised, Paris 
version of the opera, Sinopoli's bracing performance would attract attention 
for featuring a new generation of both genuine and hopeful Wagnerians in full 
flower. In his third studio encounter with the composer, Domingo proves a model 
minstrel, bringing improved German, even, robust tone and the requisite 
spiritual anguish to the protagonist. Studer conveys Elizabeth's redemptive 
purity in suitably radiant manner. Not the most voluptuous of Venuses, Baltsa 
scores through sheer intelligence, while Schmidt's Wolfram and Salminen's 
Landgrave are all one could ask. Sinopoli's conducting sweeps away the 
conventional "Tannhauser" sanctimoniousness on a rising tide of tension. ALLAN
