 The Department is issuing regulations to implement the Vacancy Reduction Program. The Notice of Funding Availability

. Under this program, certain Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) are required to develop and submit a plan regarding vacancies
in units owned or operated by the PHA. Each plan will be required to include the elements specified in the statute and
this rule. In addition, assessment teams have conducted on-site assessments of the vacancy situations of known eligible
PHAs and may provide assistance to PHAs in developing their plans. The assistance available under this program is
intended to supplement other initiatives of the PHA that will reduce the rate of addressable vacancies in a PHA's inventory.

Paperwork Reduction Statement 



The information collection requirements contained in this final rule have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget, under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 35013520), and assigned
OMB control number 25770181. 



Background 



On May 21, 1993, the Department published a proposed rule to implement the Vacancy Reduction Program (program). The
program was authorized when section 510 of the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act added a new section
14(p) to the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 14371) (1937 Act). Recently section 14(p) was amended by section
115 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102550, approved October 28, 1992) (1992 Act),
and funding was made available for the first time for the program. 

Section 14(p) requires any public housing agency (PHA) to participate in the program if the PHA has a vacancy rate that
exceeds twice the national average, is designated as troubled under section 6(j) of the 1937 Act, or has been placed
under a receiver pursuant to section 6(j)(3) of the 1937 Act. Each PHA participating in the program will be required
to develop a vacancy reduction plan that identifies vacant dwelling units in its inventory and the reasons for the
vacancies, and describes actions to be taken by the PHA for the following five years to eliminate the vacancies. 

In addition, the vacancy situations of every participating PHA will be reviewed on-site by assessment teams consisting
of representatives of the Department, independent experts knowledgeable about vacancy problems and management
issues relating to public housing, and PHA officials. The assessment teams will submit recommendations to HUD and
the PHA, and, at the request of the PHA, may assist the PHA in preparing its vacancy reduction plan.
