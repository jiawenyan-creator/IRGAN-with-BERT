  [Text] Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao Barroso has told 
RDP that if things take a turn for the worse in South Africa 
steps will be taken to make it possible for Portuguese nationals 
to leave the country. He was speaking in Johannesburg to our 
correspondent Carlos Pacheco. 
  [Pacheco] The Portuguese Government has plans for the 
repatriation of Portuguese nationals should things worsen in 
South Africa. Minister Durao Barroso gave no details, but 
confirmed that planning is in progress to enable us to respond 
to a worst-case scenario. However Durao Barroso is confident of 
a positive evolution in South Africa and does not believe that 
repatriation will be necessary. The foreign minister also 
denied rumors that Portuguese nationals are returning home in 
massive numbers, stating that the figures supplied by the 
Portuguese Embassy show nothing out of the ordinary. 
  [Begin Barroso recording] If in the past, in extreme 
conditions, we were able to receive our compatriots [post-1974 
return from the African colonies], now we would certainly be 
able to receive them much better. But this is not our goal, nor 
is it, I believe, the goal of most of the Portuguese who have 
settled here. [end recording]
