FT  15 FEB 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Bill for poll tax defaulters
I RECALL that, in answer to a question about whether people were legally
required to pay the amounts added to the poll tax to cover defaulters, you
said that they were. I have been asking my local authority since last August
if it would quote the legal/statutory provision by which I am required to
pay, but it has yet to quote exactly the relevant provision. Just how does
this law deal with the subject of making good defaulters' bills?
There is no specific provision relating to defaulters' liability being
brought into account as such. The local authority has to raise revenue to
meet its expenditure, and the budgeted expenditure has to include
outstanding liabilities. If the current, or previous, year's revenue has
fallen short because of failure of some chargepayers (or ratepayers) to meet
their obligations, the next demand for community charge (poll tax) needs to
be sufficiently large to recoup that shortfall. In the same way, income tax
payers would find themselves paying for those who successfully evade income
tax.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
