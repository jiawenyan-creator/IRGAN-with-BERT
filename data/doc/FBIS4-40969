  [Text] Yalta [no dateline as received]--Centrist political 
forces of Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine joined in the 
International Nongovernmental Association of Political Movements 
and Parties at a founding conference on 21 June. Delegates to 
the conference-- representing Russia's Democratic Choice, the 
Party of Russian Unity and Accord, the Russian Movement for 
Democratic Reforms, New Ukraine, Ukraine's Interregional Bloc of 
Reforms [MBR], Ukraine's Constitutional-Democratic Party, Civic 
Congress of Ukraine, the sociopolitical association Hromada and 
others--determined the new organization's priorities. These 
concern, first of all, the creation of conditions for political 
integration of independent countries of the CIS and the 
coordination of joint actions to expand economic cooperation. 
  Commenting on the founding of the association, Yuriy Komov, 
a 
member of the organizing committee and a leader of the Union in 
Support of the Republic of Crimea, told UNIAN that the 
association's members will persist in convincing the three 
countries' governments of the need to initiate an open common 
market in the CIS, with free movement of people, goods, and 
capital within its territory, and to coordinate CIS legislation 
to maximize citizens' rights. 
  The association's founding conference approved statements: 
"On the Sociopolitical Situation in CIS Countries and the Need 
for Cooperation Between Parties and Movements" and "On the 
Economic Integration of CIS Countries". MBR cochairman 
Volodymyr Hrynyov, Russian State Duma Deputy Aleksandr Arinin of 
the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, and Serhiy Kunitsyn of 
the Union in Support of the Republic of Crimea were elected 
cochairmen of the association. The association will continue 
its formation in the first week of September.
