  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 1 SAPA--Nine train trucks were 
derailed by an explosion between Kroonstad and Koppies in the 
Orange Free State shortly after midnight on Tuesday [1 
February], police and Spoornet [Railnet] said. 
  A locomotive and a section of the line were damaged when a 
goods train apparently set off an explosive device. Free State 
Police Liaison Officer Major Johlene van der Merwe said police 
were investigating the possibility of a link between this 
explosion and other blasts in the Free State over the past two 
months. 
  The Kroonstad blast occurred minutes after a locomotive was 
damaged by an explosive device detonated under a goods train on 
a railway line between Harrisburg and Leeudooringstad in the 
Western Transvaal shortly before midnight. The blast disrupted 
rail traffic on the line for four hours and damage is estimated 
at R[rand] 20,000. 
  A metre of the Cape Town/Johannesburg main line was damaged 
in the Kroonstad blast but traffic was not affected as trains 
were rerouted to the down line, Spoornet spokesman Jacques 
Pienaar said. All nine coaches have been put back on the rails, 
he added.
