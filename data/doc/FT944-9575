FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: SBC to underwrite Matheson Lloyd's issue
Swiss Bank Corporation has agreed to underwrite half the shares in a planned
quoted Lloyd's of London investment company which proposes to raise up to
Pounds 50m to invest in the insurance market next year.
Matheson Lloyd's Investment Trust plans to issue up to 50m ordinary shares
at 100p each, of which SBC has agreed to underwrite 25m. The Swiss bank said
it hoped to find subscribers for the balance in continental Europe, east
Asia and Bermuda, as well as in the UK.
MLIT intends to spread the money raised across about 40 Lloyd's syndicates
underwriting a broad range of insurance business. Acting as its Lloyd's
adviser is Jardine Lloyd's Advisers, a company set up jointly by SBC and JIB
Group, the international insurance broker, earlier this year.
MLIT is the latest company to announce plans for new investment in Lloyd's
from next year, and if successful would be one of the biggest entrants.
Investors' appetites for Lloyd's have been limited, particularly in the UK,
resulting from the lacklustre performance of similar investment companies
launched last year and the continuing bad publicity surrounding the
insurance market.
However, Mr Michael Kershaw, executive director at SBC, said the bank
expected a significant move towards limited liability corporate investment
at Lloyd's. 'You have to take a strong view, one way or the other, about
Lloyd's, and we have taken a positive one.'
To boost the attractiveness of MLIT, a warrant entitling shareholders to
subscribe for one ordinary share at 100p will be issued with every five
ordinary shares.
The latest date for acceptance is November 23 and dealings in the ordinary
shares and warrants are expected to start on November 29.
