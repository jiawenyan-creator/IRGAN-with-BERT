FT  07 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (South Africa): De Beers rises 3.5%
DE BEERS led shares higher in Johannesburg yesterday, although trading
volumes were generally thin.
The overall index added 31 at 3,280 and the industrial index climbed 43 to
4,406. The gold index was up 7 at 782. Dealers said activity was likely to
improve later in the week as more investors entered the market after
evaluating investment strategies.
De Beers reported that rough diamond sales by its Central Selling
Organisation had fallen by 13 per cent during 1992 to Dollars 3.42bn, with
second-half sales declining by 12 per cent to Dollars 1.63bn. However, the
fall was smaller than most analysts' forecasts and De Beers closed R2, or
3.5 per cent, up at R59.75.
De Beers' associate, Anglos, reversed an earlier loss to finish R1.15 ahead
at R87.90.
Gold shares showed resilience as investors looked for a bounce in the price
of bullion from its recent lows. Vaal Reefs gained R2 at R139 and Kloof
added 25 cents at R24.25.
Elsewhere, Gencor appreciated 20 cents to R10, Richemont improved 45 cents
to R37.25 and Sasol moved forward 35 cents to R16.85.
