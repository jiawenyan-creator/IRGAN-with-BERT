FT  14 JUN 94 / Prescott defends socialist values
Mr John Prescott, who won the toss of the coin and spoke first in the
union's beauty contest, revelled in his traditionalist tag, David Goodhart
writes.
'I'm proud of my socialist values - which are as relevant in the 1990s as in
the 1940s - and I'm proud of my trade union background,' he said.
However, he also stressed his preference for policy detail rather than
rhetoric. On the issue of unemployment, he accused the Conservatives of
creating mass unemployment as a deliberate act of policy. He pledged to 'put
jobs and social justice at the top of the agenda.
'I have a hatred of mass unemployment that came from my experience as a
seaman,' he said. He added that the two wings of the Labour movement had to
continue to work closely and to place particular stress on the importance of
implementing a minimum wage.
'We cannot compete by becoming a low-wage skivvy economy,' he said. Full
employment was still feasible, but it required detailed plans to achieve.
Otherwise it would lack credibility.
Answering questions after his contribution, Mr Prescott refused to be drawn
on the precise level for a minimum wage. But he reiterated his support for
the principle. and said that he had lived on a minimum wage while a hotel
worker.
