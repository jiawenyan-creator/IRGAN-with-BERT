the Restoration of GATT Membership as Early as Possible"] 
  [Text] 1) Market access. Decides to unilaterally 
decrease tariffs for 225 categories of products within three 
years. 
  2) Reform of the price system. Decides to reach the goal of 
straightening out price relations before 1996. 
  3) Adjustment of foreign exchange policy. The current 
practice is the coexistence of the official and market exchange 
rates, and the long-term goal is to practice a unified exchange 
rate. At present, through a downward adjustment of the exchange 
rate of yuan, the gap between the two exchange rates are being 
narrowed gradually, so as to realize the unified exchange rate 
step by step. 
  4) Active formulation of laws and regulations on foreign 
businesses. At present, the Foreign Trade Law and other laws 
are being drafted, and legislation for intellectual property 
rights is being perfected. 
  5) Reform of administration and management. The 
administrative system of examination and approval for importing 
mechanical and electrical products will be abolished step by 
step; for the products which truly need protection, a system of 
quota permits with certain transparency will be put in place as 
a substitute.
