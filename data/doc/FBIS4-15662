    [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 0600 GMT on 10 April broadcasts in 
its "Test Range" program a two-minute report, entitled "Who will 
defend the skies?," on the financial problems facing Russia's 
air defense forces. The video shows a series of shots of radar 
equipment and SAM missiles. An announcer says that the air 
defense troops now receive only 30 percent of the fuels and 
lubricants they require, with the result that fighter pilots 
spend only 25 to 40 hours in the air instead of the recommended 
150. Air crews get to fire training missiles once every two 
years. Officers and warrant officers regularly experienced 
delays with their pay. There are also rumors that the troops 
are to be disbanded. 
  The report includes an interview with Commander in Chief 
V.A. 
Prudnikov by an unidentified correspondent. Prudnikov says: 
"Yes, we really are being reduced in size. We are being 
reformed, but the process has been well thought out. We are 
removing hardware equipped with obsolete equipment and weapons, 
but retaining the most recent technology, the antiaircraft 
missile troops, the 300 complexes [as heard], our Air Force, the 
MiG-31 and Su-27, and our latest radar systems. And, you are 
also aware that the space missile defense troops have been 
attached to the air defense troops. We are trying to perform the 
basic tasks assigned to us and carry out reforms in order to 
maintain quality."
