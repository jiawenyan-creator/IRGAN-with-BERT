CONTROVERSY OVER BOOK ON MOSSAD 
According to your report (Part A, Sept. 14), the Appellate Division of the New 
York Supreme Court has dismissed a stay issued by a lower court judge, which 
had been sought by the Israeli government on the grounds that publication of a 
book, "By Way of Deception," would endanger the lives of members of Mossad, its 
intelligence agency. The work, authored by Victor Ostrovosky, a former member 
of Mossad, who had been dismissed because of his unreliability, is being 
published. 
Certain people will see in this an opportunity to have a field day. Alexander 
Cockburn, your far-left, Jew-hating, Israel-bashing columnist, has been one of 
the first (Commentary, Sept. 14). 
Let us suppose that a dismissed, former American CIA agent writes a book in 
which he accuses the U.S. of various actions harmful to Israel, and in which he 
names and thereby endangers the lives of secret CIA agents stationed in various 
parts of the world. He then goes to Israel and there has it published and 
distributed. Can you possibly imagine the uproar that would be directed against 
Israel? 
One of Ostrovosky's accusations is that Israel withheld from the United States 
information it had obtained regarding the planned Arab attack in Beirut in 
1983, which took 241 American lives. Such a charge is absurd. About the same 
time, an Israeli installation in Southern Lebanon was also bombed with great 
loss of life. Over the years, Israeli intelligence has transmitted to the 
United States hundreds of pieces of vital intelligence information worth tens 
of billions of dollars. 
Every rogue is now trying to cash in on the false notion that because of the 
end of the Cold War, Israel is no longer of importance as a strategic American 
ally. Hopefully, they will not succeed. The alliance should remain intact.
