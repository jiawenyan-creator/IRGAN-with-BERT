METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT IN KILLING OF DEAF YOUTH IS STILL IN 
HIDING 
The father of a 16-year-old boy suspected of shooting two deaf brothers in 
Granada Hills, killing one and wounding the other, said Tuesday that a meeting 
with police to discuss turning his son in "was a waste of time." 
Joseph Bellinger, father of Joey Bellinger of Long Beach, who remains in 
hiding, said he met with detectives at the Devonshire Division of the Los 
Angeles Police Department late Monday. 
"The meeting was pointless," Bellinger said, declining to disclose details of 
his discussion with police. Police confirmed Tuesday that a meeting had taken 
place.
