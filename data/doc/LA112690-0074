FOR FIRST TIME, IVORY COAST VOTERS GET A CHOICE OF PARTIES 
Voters cast ballots in the country's first multi-party parliamentary election 
Sunday amid opposition charges of intimidation and fraud by the party that has 
ruled unchallenged for 30 years. 
Early results are expected today. 
Reports indicated that turnout was low as President Felix Houphouet-Boigny's 
ruling Democratic Party headed for an easy victory. 
In the capital of Abidjan, voter turnout was as low as 30%, and reports from 
the interior of the cocoa-growing West African country confirmed the scant 
enthusiasm for the first popularity test for fledgling opposition parties. 
About 4.4 million people registered to choose 175 lawmakers from among the 490 
candidates representing 19 parties. 
The Democrats are assured of 40 seats that are unchallenged. They are expected 
to easily win a majority, reinforcing Houphouet-Boigny's huge victory last 
month in the nation's first contested presidential race. 
His sole challenger, Popular Front leader Laurent Gbagbo, accused the ruling 
party of rigging that election, in which the 85-year-old Houphouet-Boigny 
received 81.67% of the votes. 
Early Sunday, about 200 armed soldiers surrounded Gbagbo's constituency of 
Ouragahio, 170 miles northwest of Abidjan. A spokesman for the opposition 
leader said the local government there had announced that people could vote 
without producing identity or voter registration cards. 
In the central town of Bouake, Popular Front officials said their 
representatives were refused entry into polling stations to monitor voting. All 
parties fielding candidates are supposed to be able to watch the voting. 
The run-up to the elections had been quiet, with the first violence reported 
Saturday in Abidjan's suburb of Yopougon. 
Several people remained hospitalized after a clash there between supporters of 
the conservative Democratic Party and the left-leaning Popular Front.
