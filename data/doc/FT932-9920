FT  12 MAY 93 / Kinkel's visit to Zagreb
CROATIA'S military support for the Bosnian Croats will come under sharp
criticism when Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, makes his first
visit to Zagreb on Friday, writes Judy Dempsey. He will have talks with
President Franjo Tudjman and Mr Zdenko Skrabalo, the Croatian foreign
minister, and is expected to ask why Croatia continues to back Bosnia's
Croats militarily. Requests for German economic aid to reconstruct the
Croatian economy are unlikely to be high on the agenda as long the area
remains unstable.
