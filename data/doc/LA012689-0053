YOUR COINS: SENTIMENTAL VALUE MAY EXCEED PRICE 
Question: In going over some of my great grandfather's mementos from Civil War 
days, I came up with a penny -- in good condition -- and would like to know its 
worth. It is dated 1858 and has a flying eagle on the face, United States of 
America around the edge. The back has the words "one cent" surrounded by a 
wreath of leaves. -- B.H. 
Answer: You've described the Flying Eagle 1-cent piece. It's a short-lived 
series, 1856 to 1858. The 1856 cent was actually a pattern with only about 
1,000 issued. All of these early pieces are quite valuable. The 1857 and 1858 
are actually quite common with millions produced. 
The Flying Eagle was used as a transition coin and followed the long run of the 
Large Cent. Since the cent was downsized, it was felt that it would take a 
while for the public to accept something smaller with the same face value. In 
1859 the cent was redesigned once again, this time with the popular Indian head 
design. 
At one time Flying Eagles were highly prized by collectors. Some of its 
popularity has faded as silver dollars and gold pieces have gained collector 
attention. But such dips tend to be cyclical and no doubt the Flying Eagle will 
emerge once again as a collector favorite. 
Meanwhile, nice specimens are still quite expensive. Your 1858 cent, one of 
24.6 million minted, is probably in the $5-to-$20 range, depending upon 
condition. I suspect it has more sentimental value than that. 
Q: In the 1828 census of Hungary, taxes were calculated in "Rfl." and "xr." In 
1828, Hungary was under Austrian rule, and the "x" and "xr." is clearly from 
the cross design after which the Austrian kreutzer and the Hungarian krajcar 
were named, so that the "xr." was one or both of those coins. Clearly, the 
"Rfl." is some kind of florin, and the tax sums of the census imply 60 xr. 
equals 1 Rfl., which was the ratio up to 1858. But what particular coin was the 
"Rfl."? I've checked Krause's catalogue with no luck. -- A.G.F. 
A: This is one of those obscure questions that defy an answer, at least as far 
as I'm concerned. I've checked with some authorities but no one seems to know. 
You might want to check with the government of Hungary, or perhaps one of our 
readers can supply an answer.
