NEWSWIRE: 76ERS SEND CHEEKS TO SPURS IN 5-MAN DEAL 
The Philadelphia 76ers traded guards Maurice Cheeks and David Wingate and 
center Christian Welp to the San Antonio Spurs Monday for guard Johnny Dawkins 
and forward Jay Vincent. 
Cheeks is the all-time National Basketball Assn. leader in steals with 1,942 
and is 11th in assists with 6,212. A four-time All-Star, Cheeks averaged 12.2 
points in 11 seasons. 
A first-round draft pick by the 76ers in 1987, Welp averaged 3.4 points in 72 
games last season. Wingate, a second-round pick by Philadelphia in 1986, 
averaged 4.2 points last season and 8.0 in three years. 
Dawkins averaged 17.7 points through the first 23 games last season before 
developing a nerve problem in his left leg and foot which caused him to miss 50 
of the next 59 games. He wound up with a 14.2 scoring average for the season, 
13 through three seasons. 
Vincent, Dallas' second pick in 1981, has averaged 15.9 points per game through 
eight seasons with several teams. The Spurs acquired him in a four-player deal 
with Denver last Jan. 26. 
Meanwhile George Gervin, a former NBA scoring champion who quit the Spurs two 
years ago amid allegations of drug and alcohol abuse, said he wants to rejoin 
the team. "I'm very serious," Gervin said. "I feel the timing is right. The 
team they have on paper looks great. But I think they're missing a veteran. I 
think I can really help them. I think I can help motivate them." 
Spur Coach Larry Brown said he has been contacted by Gervin's advisers, but 
said that they haven't begun contract negotiations with Gervin.
