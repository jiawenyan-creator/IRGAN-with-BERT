FT  11 MAY 92 / Plea for more black judges
NUMERICAL TARGETS for the recruitment of black people should be set for all
parts of the criminal justice system, the National Association for the Care
and Resettlement of Offenders (Nacro) says in a report published today.
It says about 2 per cent of magistrates are black and that only two out of
451 circuit judges and six out of 772 recorders are black. In contrast, 16
per cent of the male and 28 per cent of the female prison population are
from ethnic minorities.
Black people are 'severely under-represented' among staff in prisons,
probation services, the legal profession, the judiciary and magistracy,
Nacro says. There is also a 'very disturbing over-representation' of black
people on the receiving end of justice.
