  [Text] Seoul, March 15 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government has decided to offer refuge to North Koreans 
defecting from the North's logging camps in Siberia, which are 
widely known for meting out inhuman treatment, informed sources 
said Tuesday. 
  The decision will be made at a meeting of related ministries 
and agencies called by the Foreign Ministry on Friday to discuss 
dealing with defectors from North Korean logging camps in 
Siberia, a government official said. 
  Participating in the meeting will be bureau head-level 
officials from Chongwadae [presidential office], the Foreign, 
Home and Justice Ministries, the National Unification Board and 
the Agency for National Security Planning. 
  Only defectors seeking refuge in South Korea will be 
accepted 
while those with "grave problems," such as involvement in a 
criminal case, will not be allowed to come, he added. 
  Diplomatic steps, including requesting the Russian 
Government 
to issue exit permits to the North Korean defectors so they can 
lawfully enter South Korea, will be discussed at the meeting. 
  Home Ministry measures for their settlement in the country 
will also be discussed. 
  Previously, the government has not allowed North Koreans 
defecting from logging camps in Siberia to enter the country, 
but it has changed this policy in view of North Koreans' rights 
as citizens of the Republic of Korea, provided for by the 
Constitution, and to protect their human rights. 
  At present, some 20,000 North Koreans are believed to be 
working in logging camps in Siberia and 150 to 200 have applied 
for refuge in South Korea through its embassy and 
consulates-general in Russia after deserting their camps, the 
sources said.
