ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; 
HAUSDORFER TO RUN FOR A FOURTH TERM 
Ending speculation that he would not run for a fourth term, Mayor Gary L. 
Hausdorfer this week filed to run for City Council in the Nov. 6 election. 
The terms of Hausdorfer, a mortgage banker, and two other incumbents, Phillip 
R. Schwartze and Anthony L. Bland, all expire in November. 
Bland and Schwartze are expected to announce whether they will seek reelection 
during a press conference at 4 p.m. today at City Hall. If either Bland or 
Schwartze decides not to run, the time period for candidate filing will be 
extended from 5 p.m. today to 5 p.m. Wednesday. Hausdorfer has long been 
considered the most politically ambitious of the council members and has often 
been mentioned as a candidate for a congressional seat. But he brushes aside 
such talk. 
" 'Politically interested' is probably a better way to put it," Hausdorfer 
said. "I think somebody once asked me what type of other political office 
interested me and I mentioned the possibility of something on the federal 
level. Ever since then, people have been saying I'm running for Congress. But I 
think anyone seriously considering running for higher office wouldn't stay on a 
City Council for 12 years." 
The possibility that one of the three incumbents might not run, thereby 
breaking up a council that has been together for 10 years, has stimulated 
interest in the race. As of Thursday, 17 people have taken out candidate 
papers, but only four had returned them. LEN HALL
