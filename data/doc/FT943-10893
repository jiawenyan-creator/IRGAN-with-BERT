FT  03 AUG 94 / CBI opposes cuts
The CBI yesterday opposed sweeping cuts in state support for business. It
backed the maintenance of spending by Mr Heseltine's Department of Trade and
Industry and argued strongly for support for British exports, saying it
would be 'a great mistake' to cut government backing for overseas trade.
