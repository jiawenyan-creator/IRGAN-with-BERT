  [Text] Pyongyang, January 9 (KCNA) -- Some 800 students 
under the South Korean Federation of General Student Councils 
held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul 
Saturday [8 January] in protest against the opening of the rice 
market. 
  They occupied the road in front of the embassy and denounced 
the United States for forcing agro-market opening and Kim 
Yong-sam the puppet for his treacherous compliance, shouting 
"oppose America forcing market opening" and "oppose Kim 
Yong-sam's sycophant diplomacy". 
  Upset by the protests of the students, the fascist clique 
mobilized police to disperse the protesters by force.
