 

The current proposal would authorize the NYSE to list and trade options on ADRs where 50% or more of the world-wide trading
volume in the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market. The proposal also provides that the percentage
of the world-wide trading volume that occurs in the U.S. ADR market meet a maintenance standard of 30% for the ADR options
to continue to be trading on the Exchange. Under the proposal, if the ADR options meet the above-noted criteria, the
options may be listed without the existence of a surveillance sharing agreement between the NYSE and the primary exchange
on which the foreign securities underlying the ADRs trade.

</FOOTNAME>
Under the proposal, should the ADR option not meet this numerical standard, the Exchange could not list the ADR option
unless there is a surveillance sharing agreement between the Exchange and the primary exchange on which the foreign
securities underlying the ADRs trade or the Commission specifically authorized the listing. The Commission would
give such authorization in the context of approving a rule filing submitted under section 19 of the Act and Rule 19b4,
thereunder.

</FOOTNOTE>


The proposal provides that to determine whether 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume in the underlying foreign
security occurs in the U.S. ADR market, the NYSE will calculate the trading volume for the previous three months in
the related securities which can affect the pricing of the foreign security underlying the ADR option.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Under the proposal, the NYSE will determine that at least 50% of the world-wide trading volume in a particular foreign
security occurs in the U.S. ADR market if the combined trading volume for ADRs overlying any class of the foreign issuer's
common stock, occurring in the U.S. ADR market, is not less than 50% of the sum of (1) the combined trading volume for
all classes of the foreign issuer's common stock, and (2) the combined trading volume for all ADRs overlying any of
these classes of stock. The above-noted calculation also will be used to determine if the trading volume in the U.S.
ADR market falls below 30% of the world-wide trading volume for the underlying foreign security.

Under the proposal, such related securities include all classes of common stock issued by the foreign issuer and ADRs
that overlie any one of these classes of common stock. See Letter from James E. Buck, Senior Vice President and Secretary,
NYSE, to Richard Zack, Branch Chief, Office of Derivatives Regulation, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''),
Commission, dated January 10, 1994 (``ADR Letter'').

See ADR Letter, supra 

note 4. Under this calculation, the trading volume for any U.S. ADR trading on an exchange that is not part of the U.S.
ADR market will be included in the determination of world-wide trading volume, but not in the determination of U.S.
ADR market trading volume. The NYSE also represents that it will use its best efforts to discover all markets (foreign
and U.S.) on which the foreign security (and any related securities) underlying the ADR options trades.

</FOOTNOTE>


The proposal also defines the U.S. ADR market as the U.S. self-regulatory organizations that are members of the Intermarket
Surveillance Group (``ISG'')
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 and whose markets are linked together by the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'').
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The U.S. self-regulatory organizations that currently make up the U.S. ADR market are the Amex, the BSE, the CBOE,
the CHX, the CSE, the NASD, the NYSE, the PSE, and the Phlx.

ISG was formed on July 14, 1983 to, among other things, coordinate more effectively surveillance and investigative
information sharing arrangements in the stock and options markets. See Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement,
July 14, 1983. The most recent amendment to the ISG Agreement, which incorporates the original agreement and all amendments
made thereafter, was signed by ISG members on January 29, 1990. See Second Amendment to the Intermarket Surveillance
Group Agreement, January 29, 1990. The members of the ISG are: The American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''), the Boston
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE''), the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE''), the Chicago Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``CHX''), the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CSE''), the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. (``NASD''), the NYSE, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE''), and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.
(``Phlx'').

ITS is a communications system designed to facilitate trading among competing markets by providing each market with
order routing capabilities based on current quotation information. The system links the participant markets and
provides facilities and procedures for: (1) The display of composite quotation information at each participant
market, so that brokers are able to determine readily the best bid and offer available from any participant for multiply
trading securities; (2) efficient routing of orders and sending administrative messages (on the functioning of
the system) to all participating markets; (3) participation, under certain conditions, by members of all participating
markets in opening transactions in those markets; and (4) routing orders from a participating market to a participating
market with a better price. The exchanges on which Empresas ADRs trade are ITS participant markets. The NASD's Computer
Assisted Execution System links NASD market makers, for order routing and execution purposes, to ITS for ADRs.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 in general, and furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to remove impediments
to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system.
