THE WORLD; 
U.S. VISAS TO PLO PROTESTED 
U.S. Jewish organizations protested the granting of U.S. visas to three 
Palestine Liberation Organization leaders to attend the U.N. General Assembly 
this year. "The three PLO representatives who have received visas are among the 
most radical members of the PLO leadership," said a statement from the 
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. "Their record 
of terrorist activity and rejectionist statements makes clear that they come 
not in the cause of peace, but of propaganda," the statement said. Seymour D. 
Reich, chairman of the conference, said: "These are not the words or deeds of 
peacemakers, but rather of violent men. . . ."
