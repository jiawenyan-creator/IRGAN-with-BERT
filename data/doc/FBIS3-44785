  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu 
Jianmin responded to a reporter's question about China's views 
on the Japanese foreign minister's visit to China on 8 January: 
  [Begin Wu recording] China attaches great importance to the 
visit by Mr. Tsutomu Hata, Japanese deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister, who will begin his visit to China on 8 
January. The relations between China and Japan are very good 
[hen hao]. The two countries' cooperation is developing in all 
fields in a sustained and steady manner, especially in the 
economic and trade field, in which the momentum of development 
has been maintained by the two countries. If I remember 
correctly, the volume of Sino-Japanese trade in 1993 hit a 
record high. We hope that Mr. Hata's visit, which will be the 
first high-level visit between China and Japan this year, will 
promote mutual understanding and promote the development of 
Sino-Japanese relations. [end recording]
