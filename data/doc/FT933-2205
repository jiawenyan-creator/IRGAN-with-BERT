FT  20 SEP 93 / International Company News: Novelle gives away Unix rights
THE BATTLE among personal computer software suppliers for leadership in the
multi-million dollar operating system market will take an unexpected and
controversial turn tomorrow.
Mr Raymond Noorda, chief executive of the US networking specialist Novelle,
will announce he is 'giving away' Novelle's rights to Unix, one of the main
contenders to become the standard operating software for networked
computers, according to Unigram. X, an industry newsletter.
Less than three months ago, Novelle paid Dollars 320m to buy Unix Systems
Laboratories from AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications giant which developed the
software.
Novelle is expected to give the rights to Unix to a computer industry
consortium, X/Open, whose members include IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Sun
Microsystems.
Novelle will apparently still collect royalties from Unix sales, but the
move may pacify customers upset that a single company could control such
important software.
Operating systems are the key to what functions a computer can perform and
what software it can use.
Microsoft of the US grew to become the world's largest personal software
company because of its ownership of MS/Dos, the most popular software for
single-user computers.
Six weeks ago Microsoft introduced its own Unix-like software, Windows NT,
and has been trying to establish it as the industry standard.
