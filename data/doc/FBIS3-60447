  [Text] Yesterday, during a ceremony marking the World Day 
To Combat AIDS, Health Minister Henrique Santillo announced 
that, during 1994, funds totaling $160 million would be released 
to combat and prevent AIDS. The funding is from the World Bank 
(IBRD), and the Brazilian Government's matching contribution 
will be $90 million. The program will have a duration of four 
years. 
  Santillo reported that agreements are being signed with 
states, some municipalities, and nongovernmental organizations 
for the new phase of the program to fight AIDS in Brazil. 
  Every day, nearly 5,000 persons in the world are infected 
with the HIV virus. The disease has already afflicted 14 million 
people, and of that total over 2 million show signs of the 
infection. With more than 43,000 cases recorded during the past 
11 years, Brazil is the fourth-ranking country for numbers of 
victims. As of last month, deaths caused by AIDS reached over 
18,000. 
  The ministry is distributing 18 million condoms to the 
population. The total cost of the campaign was $100,000.
