FT  28 JAN 93 / Phone factory seeks to expand
MOTOROLA, the US electronics company, is seeking planning permission to more
than double the size of its plant at Easter Inch in West Lothian, which
makes cellular telephones
The expansion will involve increasing employment at the plant by 600 to
1,500 by summer 1994.
Motorola opened the Easter Inch plant in January last year. It says its
current employment level of 900 people is well ahead of its original
programme. When it announced the project in March 1990 it said the plant
would eventually employ 1,500 to 2,000 people.
The Chicago-based company is seeking permission to add phases two and three
of the project, totalling 275,000 square feet, to the existing 175,000
square foot facility. Total investment will exceed Pounds 100m.
The Scottish plant will eventually be bigger than the company's plant at
Flensburg,Germany.
