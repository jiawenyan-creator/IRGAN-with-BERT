  [Excerpts] The European Union [EU] today took an important 
step toward military intervention in Bosnia. The ball is now on 
the NATO and UN court. [passage omitted] Fernando Paula Brito 
reports from Brussels. 
  [Brito] The EU has just approved a declaration supporting 
the 
use of air strikes as a means to lift the Serbian siege on 
Sarajevo. However a final decision on when the strikes would 
commence can only be taken in a few days time by NATO and the 
United Nations. Durao Barroso explained the position of the EU 
foreign ministers: 
  [Begin Barroso recording] We continue to believe that a 
negotiation for peace is important. We are not at war. We are 
seeking a peaceful objective. In any case, the latest events 
force the EU to take more serious measures, that is to consider 
the possibility of using air strikes in order to lift the siege 
on Sarajevo. [end recording] [passage omitted]
