FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: TWA cuts net deficit as revenues
are reduced
TRANS WORLD Airlines, the US carrier which expects to emerge soon from
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, yesterday unveiled a second-quarter net
loss of Dollars 52.3m compared with a deficit of Dollars 88.9m a year
earlier.
During the three months to June 30, the company's operating loss narrowed to
Dollars 31mm from Dollars 107.2m. This was partly offset by a Dollars 49.7m
reduction in gains from asset dispositions.
Revenues in the quarter fell to Dollars 792.9m from Dollars 964m. The
company's cost-saving measures implemented at the end of 1992, including
flight schedule reductions, resulted in a substantial decline in capacity
and traffic.
TWA said its load factor fell to 63.7 per cent from 67.3 per cent a year
earlier.
For the first six months, TWA had a net loss of Dollars 355.9m, including
extra ordinary gains of Dollars 172.9m on revenues of Dollars 1.5bn. This
compared with losses of Dollars 175.7m on revenues of Dollars 1.88bn last
year.
