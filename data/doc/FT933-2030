FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bryant falls slightly to Pounds 18m -
Housing side feels effects of limited recovery
BRYANT GROUP, the West Midlands-based housebuilding, property and
construction company, yesterday reported a small decline in full-year
pre-tax profits reflecting higher interest costs and the losses of
associated companies.
Pre-tax profits in the 12 months to May 31 fell to Pounds 18.3m (Pounds
20.3m) on turnover that slipped by 4 per cent to Pounds 309.7m (Pounds
322.9m).
Profits were held back by a Pounds 1.6m loss (Pounds 400,000 profit) by
associated undertakings after property provisions of nearly Pounds 2m.
Interest costs increased to Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 1.5m) reflecting the then
high interest rates associated with the group's Pounds 13.5m of borrowings
in Ireland.
Earnings per share fell to 4.9p (5.5p), just sufficient to cover the
unchanged total dividend of 4.8p per share including a final payment of
3.4p.
Mr Colin Hope, chairman, said the group had faced difficult trading
conditions during most of the financial year and that all divisions had
experienced pressure on prices.
He said: 'The limited recovery in the economy has had a positive impact on
the group's housing operations, but so far has not significantly benefited
our construction or property activities.' Turnover, but not operating
margins, increased by more than 20 per cent in the second half, he added.
Operating profits rose to Pounds 22.6m (Pounds 21.4m) and margins, helped by
an improved contribution from the construction division, widened from 6.6
per cent to 7.3 per cent.
The core housebuilding operations, which are being expanded, lifted
operating profits to Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 15.6m) on increased turnover of
Pounds 224.3m (Pounds 196.6m).
House completions rose by 21 per cent to a record 2,815 at a reduced average
price of Pounds 83,000 (Pounds 86,000), but Mr Andrew MacKenzie, chief
executive, said prices 'bottomed out' in the spring.
At the year end, Bryant and associates had a land bank of just under 10,000
plots. Last year, the group spent Pounds 70m on land purchases and it plans
to spend more this year, but Mr MacKenzie warned that there were already
signs of 'some pressure' on land prices, particularly in the south.
Meanwhile the construction division reported sharply lower turnover of
Pounds 65.4m (Pounds 100.5m) reflecting a determination to avoid negative
margin tendering. However, profits rose to Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 4.6m) and the
forward orders stand at Pounds 60m (Pounds 40m).
COMMENT
Bryant builds quality houses, and volumes should continue to rise as the
recovery takes hold. Of more concern, however, are the reports of land price
pressures. These could limit margin gains as Bryant attempts to broaden its
regional housebuilding activities and expand its relatively short land bank
outside the Midlands.
Nevertheless Bryant has an ungeared balance sheet and is a well-managed
group heading in the right direction. Pre-tax profits should reach Pounds
29m this year producing earnings of 7.3p and a prospective p/e just above
20. But the stock looks much less expensive against projected pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 47m and earnings of 11.4p in 1995.
