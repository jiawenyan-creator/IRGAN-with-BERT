FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: BET refinances Dollars 140m of Amps
BET, the industrial services group, is refinancing Dollars 140m (Pounds 81m)
of its Dollars 500m of auction market preferred stock (Amps) by way of a
private placement by the National Westminster Bank.
Amps are securities which can only be redeemed by the issuer and which have
an interest rate set by investors bidding for the paper at auctions,
generally held every 28 days.
However, some Amps issues have been fixed for five year periods.
NatWest will issue Dollars 140m of notes in the US private placement market,
and use the proceeds to buy some of BET's Amps. Investors in the notes will
still be exposed to BET's credit risk.
The NatWest notes will have a five year term giving BET a fixed rate of
interest over that period. After that the Amps will come back into the
market.
Observers said that by taking Dollars 140m out of the Dollars 500m Amps BET
has outstanding, the rest may achieve a more favourable interest rate at
future auctions. BET's Amps have this week been downgraded by Standard &amp;
Poor's, the credit rating agency, from A to A-.
