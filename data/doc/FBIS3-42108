  [Text] Kaluga -- In our economic chaos, strategic 
materials are also becoming a source of profit for market 
businessmen. In Obninsk staffers of the organized crime 
administration of the Kaluga Internal Affairs Administration 
came across the vice president of one of those commercial firms 
with a fashionable foreign name and discovered that he had a 
container of uranium-235 in his possession. It is no secret 
that this product is used as fuel for nuclear reactors and thus 
commands a high price. A further search led to the city of 
Elektrostal in Moscow Oblast, where the vice president's brother 
was employed at an enterprise. He had 30 times more uranium in 
his possession than his Obninsk brother. According to one 
account, this valuable fuel might have been destined for the 
Near East or Germany.
