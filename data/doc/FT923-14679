FT  07 JUL 92 / Letter: US hard currency plan for former Soviet Union
recalls Keynes
Sir, Mr Samuel Brittan's article, 'Case for Russian 'dollars'' (June 22),
affirms that the rouble is dysfunctional. To remedy Russia's currency
malady, Mr Brittan recommends that all currencies should be allowed freely
to circulate in Russia, and that 'there may be a case for western
governments providing hard currencies not just as a stabilisation fund or
for governments to use in buying imports, but directly in loans to local
business to put into the circulation'.
Following Mr Brittan's general line of argument for legalised
'dollarisation' in the former Soviet Union (FSU), we have developed detailed
proposals for establishing currency boards in the FSU. The boards would
issue 'hard' roubles backed 100 per cent by hard currency reserves; boards
would not accept deposits and their sole function would be to exchange hard
roubles for reserve currency at a fixed rate on demand.
Currency boards that issued hard, competing roubles would have two features
that would make them more attractive than simple dollarisation: boards would
earn seignorage because their liabilities (hard roubles) would not pay
interest while their assets would earn interest, and local pride would not
be challenged because hard roubles would circulate in the FSU.
To facilitate the implementation of our proposals, the US Senate passed an
amendment to the Freedom Support Act on July 1 1992. That amendment states
that 'the Congress expresses its support for the United States
participation, in sums up to Dollars 3,000,000,000 in a currency
stabilisation fund or funds for the independent states of the former Soviet
Union, which may be used for the establishment and/or support of currency
boards in those cases where the president determines that a currency board
would be more likely to achieve success in promoting a stable, convertible
currency and sustained economic growth'.
When presidents Bush and Yeltsin meet in Munich this week, we trust that
currency boards will be on their agenda, and that both leaders will recall
that the only fully convertible rouble this century was issued by a currency
board designed by none other than John Maynard Keynes.
