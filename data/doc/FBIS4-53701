  [Text] Tokyo, May 21 KYODO -- A sense of concern is 
growing in the Bank of Japan (BOJ) over a narrowing gap between 
short-term interest rates and the official discount rate, 
financial sources said Saturday [21 May]. 
  The central bank is pursuing a policy of encouraging a fall 
in short-term interest rates to help promote Japan's economic 
recovery and to support the flagging U.S. dollar. 
  The policy caused the unsecured, overnight interbank call 
money rate to fall to a record low of 2.06 percent on May 11. 
  The rate has remained little changed since then and is now 
only 0.3 percentage point higher than the official discount 
rate, now 1.75 percent, which the BOJ charges on its loans to 
commercial banks. 
  That means that the BOJ, whose loans are becoming less 
attractive to commercial banks, is losing some of its power to 
adjust commercial interest rates, the sources said. 
  Some money market watchers are already speculating that a 
further cut in the discount rate is imminent. 
  For the record, BOJ officials are unconcerned about the fall 
in the overnight call money rate, saying a temporary fall in the 
rate below the discount rate would do little harm.
