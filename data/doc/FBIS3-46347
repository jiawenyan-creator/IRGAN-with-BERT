  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- A thorough report 
on crime in China during the present period, one of the 
country's key national research projects in science and 
technology, has just been completed. 
  This was learned today from the Ministry of Public Security. 
  The 5-million-word research report offers "systematic and 
thorough analysis and discussions" on the overall situation, 
causes and trends of current crime in China, and introduces new 
tactics to curb them, said a ministry spokesman. 
  A committee consisting of a dozen political and legal 
experts 
in the country and 20 provincial representatives met in Beijing 
today to assess this research result. 
  The spokesman said that more than 1,000 experts conducted 
investigations in 20 provinces for three years, with some 10,000 
criminal cases and 300 police sub-stations surveyed. 
  Through this research, according to the spokesman, China has 
established a computer system to collect, process, store and 
consult on criminal information. 
  Some special research institutions and other academic bodies 
on crime have also been set up. 
  "This research is of great value for fighting against crime 
and promoting China's criminology theories," said Vice-Minister 
Bai Jingfu at the symposium. 
  A large number of personnel have been trained in this 
research, and some have become experts in research, education 
and public security work.
