  [Text] Beijing, February 22 (XINHUA) -- China has so far 
opened 201 ports to the outside world, according to an official 
from the leading group for port administration under the State 
Council. 
  These include 22 state class ports opened in 1993. They are 
12 seaports, seven airports and three land ports. 
  The 201 ports include 108 seaports, 46 airports, 12 railway 
ports and 35 highway ports. 
  Before China implemented the reform and open policy, there 
were 51 ports open to the outside world. 
  These outlets have played an important role in Sino-foreign 
economic and cultural exchanges, Ye said. 
  Ye said more ports have been set up in inland areas in 
recent 
years. But a decade ago most open ports were scattered in 
border or coastal areas. 
  Besides state ports, some localities have also opened a 
number of provincial ports, which have greatly promoted local 
economic development. 
  He revealed that the country will open more ports this year
