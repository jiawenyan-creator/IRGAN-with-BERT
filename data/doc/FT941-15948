FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Japanese trading house to
liquidate finance unit
Itochu, a leading Japanese trading house, at the end of March will liquidate
Itochu Finance, a finance subsidiary set up during the late 1980s as a
vehicle to invest funds in financial markets. The company will book an
extraordinary loss of Y28bn (Dollars 249m) for the current year to March.
Many Japanese companies, which invested in the stock market during the asset
'bubble' of the late 1980s, have suffered heavy losses following the plunge
in Japanese share prices in 1990.
Other leading trading houses, including Mitsubishi, Sumitomo and Marubeni,
have started to write off loss-making finance units. Of the Y28bn, Itochu
booked Y9.8bn in extraordinary losses at the end of the first half in
September.
Itochu said it would raise funds by selling assets to cover part of the
liquidation losses. However, it now expects an after-tax profit of Y2bn for
the year, rather than the previously forecast Y6bn.
Itochu Finance's total liabilities exceeded its total assets by Y3.1bn at
the end of August as losses from its financial investments mounted to
Y15.6bn. The parent company plans to liquidate the balance of tokkin, or
specified money trusts and other fund trusts at the unit.
