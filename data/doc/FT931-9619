FT  12 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Forte
Forte has chosen a good moment to launch its Pounds 200m debenture. Lack of
supply of long-dated paper allowed it to command a narrow 115 basis point
spread over the equivalent gilt. By moving before pressure of government
borrowing pushes up absolute yields, it has secured 25-year money at little
more than 10 per cent. That looks cheap compared with the cost of equity,
assuming that Forte will start increasing its dividend again at some time
over the next quarter century.
But the issue will still replace debt with debt. It is no substitute for a
rights issue. If yesterday's 2 per cent rise in Forte's shares meant
investors were reassured on this score, they were probably worrying
needlessly in the first place. There are other reasons why Forte is unlikely
to join the queue of companies seeking cash. One is its uncovered dividend.
A rights issue would be difficult to market unless the payout were cut and
rebased, which would in turn require sweeping changes at the top. So it is
just as well for Mr Rocco Forte that the company's balance sheet is less
stretched since the sale of Gardner Merchant.
