THE SIDELINES; 
NO DATE YET FOR TV NHL REPLAYS 
No date has been set for the National Hockey League to begin using television 
replays to decide disputed goals but the system will probably be adopted, a 
league spokesman said today. 
"There is no resolution yet," NHL spokesman Gary Meagher said in response to a 
report in the Toronto Star that the league would begin using replays for the 
Stanley Cup playoffs in 1991. 
The league will experiment with replays during the preseason in 1990, the 
newspaper reported. Only the referee would be allowed to seek a television 
ruling, it said. 
Meagher said replays were discussed at an NHL general managers meeting in 
Chicago last month and will be on the agenda at the next meeting in January at 
Orlando, Fla.
