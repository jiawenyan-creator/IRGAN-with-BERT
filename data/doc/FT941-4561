FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Warning on earnings by Int'l
Paper hits shares
International Paper's shares were battered Wednesday as the company quietly
began telling securities analysts that first-quarter results would be below
expectations.
The company, which had benefited through much of 1993 from price increases
in its primary product line, uncoated sheet paper, is suffering from heavy
discounting this quarter, analysts said.
Wall Street had been projecting first-quarter earnings of about 75 cents per
share for the company.
Ms Evadna Lynn, analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, said those estimates were
being adjusted to 65 to 70 cents per share.
International Paper reported earnings of Dollars 100m or 81 cents per share
in the forth quarter of 1993.
International Paper's stock fell 4 per cent, or Dollars 2 3/4 in yesterday's
trading, to Dollars 71 1/2 .
Ms Lynn estimated that prices for uncoated printing papers have dropped
Dollars 40 per ton from the fourth-quarter highs, erasing about half of the
price gains experienced during the first three quarters of 1993.
Moreover, price increases for linerboard and corregated boxes, scheduled for
this spring, have been postponed, she said.
Stocks of other paper companies fell along with International Paper
yesterday, with Georgia Pacific closing down Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 70.
