<F P=106> [Report signed "fy": "Where Are the 81,000 Tonnes of </F>
Ammunition? Questions About the Russian Troop Withdrawal"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 15 February -- Irregularities, which might 
lead to serious difficulties between the German and Russian 
sides, have come to light in the Russian troop withdrawal from 
eastern Germany. The Russian Army leadership is currently 
unwilling or not in a position to provide key information about 
the whereabouts of 81,000 tonnes of ammunition -- an amount that 
would fill 4,000 railroad wagons -- which, according to 
information that they gave when they began the withdrawal, 
should still be in Germany. The German side fears that the 
Russian military might have buried the ammunition at the sites 
that they have used until now. In 1993, the Russian forces 
leadership requested permission to destroy, that is, blow up 
75,000 tonnes of ammunition at their training sites. The 
permission was denied. The German authorities believe that the 
stocks may be defective, which would make their transportation 
particularly dangerous, or consist of outdated ammunition, for 
which the Russian military no longer possesses appropriate 
weapons systems. The Bundeswehr does not have an overview of 
the situation, because they have no possibility of inspecting 
Russian military facilities and the Russian leadership does not 
reply to queries. Thus, the Bundeswehr has to compare the 
materiel that has been transported with the information on 
stocks that they were given when the withdrawal began. 
  In 1991, that is, before the withdrawal started, the 
leadership of the Western Group of Forces stated that their 
stocks of ammunition amounted to 677,000 tonnes. That was less 
than the German side had assumed. In accordance with 
German-Russian agreements 317,500 tonnes were removed from 
Germany in 1991 and 193,910 tonnes were removed in 1992. This 
means that 165,590 tonnes of ammunition still had to be in 
Germany at the beginning of 1993. The withdrawal plan envisaged 
that 125,000 tonnes would be removed in 1993 and that the other 
40,590 tonnes would be transported to Russia in 1994 along with 
the remaining military units. In 1993, however, the actual 
quantity of ammunition removed was well below the projected 
amount. Although the first deputy commander in chief of the 
Western Group of Forces stated in writing in the summer of last 
year that the backlog would be eliminated by the end of the 
year, only 68,990 tonnes were transported instead of the 125,000 
tonnes that have been agreed. 
  On 28 September of last year, the Russian military 
leadership 
suddenly issued new information. The commander in chief of the 
Western Group of Forces, General Burlakov, wrote to the German 
liaison staff stating that his forces had used up 32,875 tonnes 
of ammunition in 1991 and 23,980 tonnes in 1992, that is, 56,855 
tonnes altogether. 
  The German liaison staff doubts the veracity of these 
figures, because training on Russian firing ranges has been 
"stopped as much as possible." In addition, 11,331 military 
trucks would have been needed to transport that quantity of 
ammunition. They would have had to have moved the ammunition 
from the Russian forces main depots in Biesenthal near Berlin 
and Wulkow near Magdeburg to the Russian firing ranges, and that 
did not happen. In his letter, Burlakov does not state how much 
ammunition would be used this year. Burlakov stated that the 
remaining stocks of ammunition that would be removed in 1994 
only amount to 5,560 tonnes. 
  In its annual assessment for 1993, the Western Group of 
Forces provided yet another set of figures. It is now asserted 
that 24,185 tonnes of ammunition were used in addition to the 
68,990 tonnes of ammunitions that were removed last year. The 
quantity that is to be transported back to Russia in 1994 has 
now risen by 10,000 tonnes to 15,560 tonnes. Despite these 
evident contradictions, the commander in chief of the Western 
Group of Forces firmly rejected German requests for an 
explanation. Burlakov seemed particularly annoyed about the 
fact that doubts were being expressed about the reliability of 
his figures and he demanded that his figures be simply accepted 
without explanation. The German side is concerned that the 
facilities the Russians still have in which ammunition can be 
suitably stored are insufficient for the storage of the 80,000 
tonnes, the whereabouts of which are still unaccounted for. The 
storage capacity that the Russians currently have amounts to 
60,000 tonnes. 
  Until now, the Russian side has adhered to all the 
provisions 
of withdrawal agreements. According to Russian figures, on 1 
February, only 29,908 out of an original 338,800 troops were 
still in Germany and 33,506 out of an original 207,400 
civilians: 248 out of a total of 4,288 combat tanks were still 
in Germany, as well as 1,228 out of 8,208 armored personnel 
carriers, and 185 out of 3,664 artillery pieces.
