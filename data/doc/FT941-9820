FT  12 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hard to exercise your rights
Sir, Are company registrars aware of the obstacle course they set for
shareholders who wish to take up their rights issues? The form for Berisford
International requires me (1) to search 30 sq in of the minutest print to
find out to whom to make my cheque payable; (2) write 'National Westminster
Bank plc a/c Berisford International plc' in the 3.5in space allowed on my
cheque; and (3) squeeze a 10-line address on to an envelope.
No wonder they do not provide me with a return envelope with the form.
