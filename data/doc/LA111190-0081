SEND MAIL BACK TO THE POLITICIANS 
It's over! My mailbox can breathe a sigh of relief. My phone may stop ringing. 
TV advertisements can return to showing the latest soap powder, well, for a 
time anyway. 
We tried to make informed decisions, we voted, and now we wait and see the 
results. 
I am curious, now that it's all over, will either Tom Umberg or Curt Pringle 
ever write to us? And after receiving four calls on Tuesday from the Umberg 
camp, and three from the Pringle camp, urging us to vote, I wonder if we'll 
ever hear from them again. 
Now we've got to decide what to do with all the "slate mail" we received over 
the past weeks. I know, let's recycle it. 
Hey, I've got an even better idea. . . . Let's parcel it all up and send it 
back where it came from. Maybe then they will know what it's like to have to 
dig through piles of unwanted garbage just to find your real mail. If all the 
people in Orange County who received this political hate mail sent it back, 
maybe the politicians might get the message it's not wanted.
