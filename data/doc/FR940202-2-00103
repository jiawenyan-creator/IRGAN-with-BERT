 

V. Risk Factors and Control Measures



Several large studies have examined potential risk factors for nosocomial bacterial pneumonia (Table 3).

7,34,35,128,129

 Although specific risk factors may differ between study populations, they can be grouped into the following general
categories: (1) Host factors such as extremes of age and severe underlying conditions, including immunosuppression;
(2) factors, such as admission to the ICU, underlying chronic lung disease, or coma, that enhance colonization of
the oropharynx and/or stomach by microorganisms; (3) conditions favoring aspiration or reflux, including endotracheal
intubation or insertion of nasogastric tube; (4) conditions requiring prolonged use of mechanical ventilatory
support with exposure to contaminated respiratory equipment and/or contact with colonized hands of healthcare
workers; and (5) factors that impede adequate pulmonary toilet, such as surgical procedures involving the head,
neck, thorax, or upper abdomen, and immobilization due to trauma or illness.

A. Oropharyngeal, Tracheal, and Gastric Colonization



The association between colonization of the oropharynx,

81,130

 trachea,

131

 or stomach

103,104,110,116

 and predisposition to gram-negative bacillary pneumonia prompted attempts to prevent infection either by prophylactic
local application of antimicrobial agent(s)

132,133

 or utilizing the phenomenon of local bacterial interference.

134,135

 Although early work suggested that the former method, aerosolized antimicrobials, could eradicate common gram-negative
pathogens from the upper respiratory tract,

131

 superinfection occurred in some patients receiving this therapy.

132134,136,137

 The latter method, bacterial interference (with alpha-hemolytic streptococci), has been successfully used by
some investigators to prevent oropharyngeal colonization by aerobic gram-negative bacilli.

134

 However, the efficacy of this method for use in general has not been evaluated.

The administration of antacids and H2-blockers for prevention of stress bleeding in critically ill, postoperative,
and/or mechanically ventilated patients has been associated with gastric bacterial overgrowth in many studies.

34,105,106,111,115,116,138140

 Sucralfate, a cytoprotective agent that has little effect on gastric pH and may have bactericidal properties of its
own, has been suggested as a potential substitute for antacids and H2-blockers.

141143

 The results of clinical trials comparing the risk of pneumonia in patients receiving sucralfate to that in patients
given antacids and/or H2-blockers have been variable.

105,111,140,141,144,145

 In most randomized trials, ICU patients receiving mechanically assisted ventilation and antacids with or without
H2b lockers had increased gastric pH, high bacterial counts in the gastric fluid, and increased risk of pneumonia
compared with patients given sucralfate.

105,111,140,141,144

 In one report with a large number of study patients, the incidence of early-onset pneumonia (occurring &gt;4 days
after intubation) did not differ between patient groups, but late-onset pneumonia occurred in 5% of 76 patients who
received sucralfate, 16% of 69 given antacids, and 21% of 68 who received an H2-blocker.

140

 On the other hand, a meta-analysis of data from eight earlier studies did not show a strong association between nosocomial
pneumonia and drugs that raise gastric pH.

146

 Further comparative studies are underway in which bronchoscopy with PSB or BAL is utilized for the diagnosis of pneumonia.

Selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) is another strategy designed to prevent bacterial colonization
and lower respiratory tract infection in mechanically ventilated patients.

147170

 SDD is aimed at preventing oropharyngeal and gastric colonization with aerobic gram-negative bacilli and 

Candida 

spp., without altering the anaerobic flora (Table 2).

147170

 A variety of SDD regimens use a combination of locally administered nonabsorbable antibiotic agents such as polymyxin,
an aminoglycoside (tobramycin, gentamicin, or, rarely, neomycin), or a quinolone (norfloxacin or ciprofloxacin),
coupled with either amphotericin B or nystatin. The local antimicrobial preparation is applied as a paste to the oropharynx
and given orally or via the nasogastric tube four times a day. In addition, in many studies, a systemic (intravenous)
antimicrobial such as cefotaxime or trimethoprim is administered to the patient.

While most clinical trials,

147151,153160,162,164,169

 including two meta-analyses,

163,170

 of SDD have demonstrated a decrease in the rates of nosocomial respiratory infections, these trials have been difficult
to assess because they have differed in study design and population, and many have had short follow-up periods (Table
2). In most of these studies, the diagnosis of pneumonia was based on clinical criteria; bronchoscopy with BAL or PSB
was used in only a few studies.

152,153,164,167,169



Two recently published large double-blind, placebo-controlled trials demonstrated no benefit from SDD.

166,167

 In one, a large French multicenter study by Gastinne et al, a significant decrease in incidence of gram-negative bacillary
pneumonia was not accompanied by a decrease in pneumonia from all causes.

167

 In the other study, by Hammond et al, no differences were noted between patients randomized to SDD or to placebo; however,
both patient groups received intravenous cefotaxime.

166



Although an earlier meta-analysis suggested a trend toward decreased mortality in patients given SDD,

163

 a more recent and more extensive analysis highlights the equivocal effect of SDD on patient mortality, as well as the
high cost of using SDD to prevent pneumonia or death (i.e., in order to prevent one case of nosocomial pneumonia, or
one death due to nosocomial pneumonia, 6 [range: 59] or 23 [range: 1339] patients, respectively, would
have to be given SDD.

170

 Furthermore, there are concerns over the development of antimicrobial resistance and superinfection with gram-positive
bacteria and other antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens.

148,149,152,155

 Thus, currently available data do not justify the routine use of SDD for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia in ICU
patients. SDD may be ultimately useful for specific subsets of ICU patients, such as those with trauma or severe immunosuppression,
e.g., bone-marrow transplant recipients.

A new approach advocated to prevent oropharyngeal colonization in patients receiving enteral nutrition is to reduce
bacterial colonization of the stomach by acidifying the enteral feed.

171

 Although the absence of bacteria from the stomach has been confirmed in patients given acidified enteral feeding,
the effect on the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia has not been evaluated.
