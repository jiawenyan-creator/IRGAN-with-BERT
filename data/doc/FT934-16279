FT  07 OCT 93 / One-stop garages attract criminals
NEW-LOOK petrol stations, with convenience shops, car washes and video
counters, have proved a hit with consumers. But the formula has made them a
magnet for crime, according to an industry committee.
Mr Stuart Howell, chairman of the British oil industry service station
security committee, concedes that the design 'has contributed' to their
attractiveness to criminals.
'The level of business is up, the amount of money kept on the premises is up
and they have extended the range of goods they carry,' he said yesterday.
'The fact that many are open 24 hours a day also poses problems.'
A Gallup survey commissioned by the committee showed that the level of
burglaries and robberies - the two crimes of most concern to operators
because of their potential for violence - was about the same in the year to
July as that recorded by the committee's first survey in 1992. Of the 600
respondents in this year's survey, 37 per cent reported at least one
burglary and 19 per cent said they had been the target of a robbery. One
employee was killed in a robbery in the Midlands when he refused to show the
robbers where the money was kept.
The big rise, however, has been in petty crime. About 84 per cent of
respondents said they were victims of shoplifting, compared with only 59 per
cent in the previous survey, while 94 per cent reported problems with
drivers leaving without paying. A pre-payment scheme, under study in
Manchester, could be extended, said Mr Howell.
The survey also revealed increased efforts by companies to counter crime.
