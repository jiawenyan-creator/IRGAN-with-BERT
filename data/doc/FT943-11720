FT  28 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Waters wanted
Water stocks were a strong feature as investor confidence grew ahead of
today's important regulatory review by Ofwat. Sector specialists said that
the value to be placed on the 'K' factor - the amount the water companies
can increase their prices above inflation after 1995 - was expected to be
around 1.3. The variance above or below this will determine how the market
reacts - and whether the companies accept or reject the Ofwat
recommendation. Rejection would mean an MMC inquiry. Ofwat will also
recommend the capital expenditure for the next five years, with the market
forecasting a figure of Pounds 16bn.
All the leading shares made strong ground as rumours abounded over the
report, which landed on the companies' desks two days ago. Marketmakers were
watching closely the tactics of those houses with water company brokerages
amid reports of selected heavy buying. Northumbrian was in particular
demand, the shares surging 21 to 597p. Yorkshire was also wanted, adding 16
to 541p, Southern gained 20 to 555p and Anglian 11 to 525p.
