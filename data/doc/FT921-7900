FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: SA glass group seeks R354m
PLATE Glass and Shatterprufe Industries, South Africa's largest glass
manufacturer which recently became part of the South African Breweries (SAB)
group, has announced it will be raising R354m (Dollars 125m) in a rights
issue.
The cash will enable PGSI to increase the equity base of its offshore
operations and refinance local borrowings. Some R210m will be used to
recapitalise PGSI's international operations, enabling them to take
advantage of growth opportunities. The balance will, in the short term, be
used to reduce local borrowings.
PGSI's ordinary shareholders will be offered renounceable rights to
subscribe for new ordinary shares at R43 a share, a 20 per cent discount to
the market price of R54 at the time of the announcement.
The move is part of a complex web of transactions announced over the past
two months between PGSI and SAB. The main transaction sees SAB acquiring
54.6 per cent of the equity of Placor, holding company for PGSI, with a
proposed scheme of arrangement in Placor whereby, if successful, it will
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of SAB.
The second leg of the transaction is the purchase by PGSI of UK glass group
Pilkington's effective 48.4 per cent interest in Glass SA, the holding
company for the main part of South Africa's float and automotive glass
industry.
The other legs are PGSI's rights issue and the disposal by Afcol, an SAB
subsidiary, to PGSI of its interest in P. G. Bison, a company that
manufactures and distributes particleboard and decorative laminates.
The rationale for the latter deal is that P. G. Bison is a non-managed,
equity account-ed interest of Afcol. The sale will improve Afcol's financial
structure and provide the funds for Afcol to concentrate on its core
business. It also gives PGSI the opportunity to increase its holding in P.
G. Bison from 47.8 to 71.7 per cent.
