  [Text] Ankara -- Bahattin Gunel, assistant general 
secretary of the DEP [Democracy Party], indicated that the 
people in the [Kurdish] region refused to go to the polls in 
protest of the existing political system, and argued that the 
mayors who won election with the support of the state, special 
teams, and village guards cannot represent the people and 
therefore are illegitimate. 
  Gunel announced that they are not going to set up a new 
party 
and will defend the DEP to the very end. 
  At a news conference yesterday, Bahattin Gunel disclosed the 
decisions adopted at the DEP assembly the previous day. 
  Indicating that they are resolved to defend the legal 
democratic foundation to the very end, Gunel said that the 
leading party officials will not resign from the party to evade 
being barred from political life. 
  Pointing to the abolition of the HEP [People's Toil Party] 
and OZDEP [Freedom and Democracy Party], Gunel said: "If the 
DEP too is closed down, we will see how we must deal with the 
situation. If a political vacuum arises we will fill it." 
  Indicating that the Welfare Party's rise was not genuine, 
Bahattin Gunel said that "despite attempts to appear otherwise, 
the Welfare Party is also one of the political system's parties" 
and that it got state support during these elections. 
  Indicating that the DEP was the most successful party in the 
elections from which it was forced to withdraw, Gunel said: "In 
general, the Kurdish people in the east and southeast protested 
against the political system by either not going to the polls or 
by burning their ballots. In some places the protesters 
amounted to 60 percent of the voters." 
  Indicating that the elected mayors are illegitimate, 
Bahattin 
Gunel said that the candidates elected by "the state, special 
teams, and village guards" cannot represent the people.
