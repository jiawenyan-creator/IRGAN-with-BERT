  [Text] Tokyo, May 21 KYODO -- Key coalition strategist 
Ichiro Ozawa said Saturday [21 May] that North Korea's suspected 
nuclear weapons development program may turn the situation on 
the Korean peninsula into a serious crisis. 
  In a speech in the northeastern Japan port city of Ofunato, 
Iwate Prefecture, Ozawa said he is "concerned that Japan may be 
isolated in the international community if it cannot do anything 
(about the crisis)." 
  "Many say remittances from Japan (to North Korea) are 
equivalent to North Korea's state budget and that (North Korean) 
high-tech military machines were made in Japan," said Ozawa, the 
secretary general of the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party].
