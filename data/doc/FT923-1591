FT  22 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Private Bolivian mines opposed
BOLIVIAN mining unions have voted to occupy mines subject to joint venture
deals in protest at the government's drive to slim down Comibol, the state
mining corporation, and open it up to private investment.
The unions want to stop Comibol going ahead with joint venture and leasing
deals with private companies. Since the concept of joint venture contracts
was first touted last year, only two have been signed.
Private companies that have signed deals with Comibol, including Minproc and
Cominesa, have been unable to start operations because of industrial action.
Mr Alvaro Rejas, the Bolivian mining minister, has warned that the
government will shut down any mine which is occupied, and dismiss any miners
taking action. However, both Mr Rejas and Comibol's management lack
government backing to confront the unions and speed up the joint venture
process.
Mr Rejas said the action would be an act of suicide for Bolivian mining.
Several potential private mining investors cite labour troubles as a
significant problem.
