ONLY THE TV WILL WITNESS COACH'S GROWL 
Texas-El Paso basketball Coach Don Haskins, still suffering from a severe case 
of laryngitis, said he likely will remain sidelined the rest of the season. 
Haskins, nicknamed "The Bear" because of his sideline growl, said his voice has 
improved recently, but he won't return court side because he tends to yell 
during games. 
"I even screamed at the TV set," Haskins said, referring to the Miners' road 
loss to Hawaii he watched last week. 
Haskins has missed nine games but has attended home practices. Norm Ellenberger 
has been Texas-El Paso's interim coach since Dec. 23. 
The Miners are 5-4 during Haskins' absence. 
"If something isn't broke, why fix it?" Haskins said. "My presence would change 
things, and that wouldn't be good for our basketball team." 
Haskins underwent a biopsy in October, and a doctor determined he had 
laryngitis, which plagued him for a year. 
The doctor also said Haskins does not have cancer.
