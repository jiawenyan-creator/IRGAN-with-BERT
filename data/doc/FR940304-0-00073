 



Nothocestrum breviflorum 

of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), a 
stout tree 33 to 39 ft (10 to 12 m) tall with a trunk up to 18 in (45 
cm) in diameter, has deciduous, alternate, stalked, oblong or 
elliptic-oblong, thick and papery-textured, toothless leaves which 
are 2 to 4.7 in (5 to 12 cm) long and 1.2 to 2.4 in (3 to 6 cm) wide. 
Numerous bisexual, radially symmetrical flowers are clustered at the 
ends of short spurs (branches with much shortened internodes) on 
individual stalks 0.2 to 0.4 in (4 to 10 mm) long. Each flower 
consists of a 0.2 to 0.4 in (6 to 11 mm) long, four-lobed tubular 
calyx split on one side and a greenish-yellow four-lobed corolla 
which barely projects beyond the calyx. The fruit, a somewhat 
spherical or oblong, orange-red berry about 0.2 to 0.3 in (6 to 8 mm) 
in diameter, is enclosed by the calyx. Seeds have not been observed. 
This species can be distinguished from others of this endemic 
Hawaiian genus by the leaf shape; the clusters of more than three 
flowers arranged on the ends of short branches; and the broad fruit 
enclosed by the calyx (Symon 1990). 
Historically, 

Nothocestrum breviflorum 

was found only on the 
island of Hawaii from the southern portion of the Kohala Mountains; 
the northern slope of Hualalai; and the eastern, southern, and 
western slopes of Mauna Loa. Today, extant populations have been 
found in much of the species' historic range, from near Waimea, near 
Kiholo, in Puu Waawaa, in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (HVNP) in 
Kipuka Ki and near Holei Pali, and in the South Point area. These 9 
populations, which extend over a distance of about 63 by 41 mi (101 
by 66 km), are found on privately, State-, and federally owned land 
and contain an estimated 53 known individuals (HHP 1991p1 to 1991p12; 
J. Lau and W. Wagner, pers. comms., 1992). This species typically 
grows in koa- and 'ohi'a- or lama-dominated Lowland Dry Forests and 
Montane Dry or Mesic Forests, often on as substrate, at elevations 
between 590 and 6,000 ft (180 and 1,830 m) (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990, 
HHP 1991p1, 1991p2, 1991p5, 1991p7, 1991p12, HPCC 1991h, Symon 1990). 
Associated species include 'iliahi, 

Caesalpinia kavaiensis 

(uhiuhi), 
and 

Erythrina sandwicensis 

(wiliwili) (HHP 1991p1, 1991p3, 1991p4, 
1991p12, HPCC 1991h; W. Wagner, pers. comm., 1992). The major 
threats to 

Nothocestrum breviflorum 

are habitat conversion associated 
with residential and recreational development, competition from alien 
species such as Christmas berry, fountain grass, lantana, and 


Leucaena leucocephala 

(koa haole); browsing by cattle; fire; and 
stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the 
small number of existing individuals (HHP 1991p4, 1991p6, 1991p12, 
Lamb 1981; W. Wagner, pers. comm., 1992). 



Ochrosia kilaueaensis 

was first collected by Forbes in 1915 and 
was named by St. John in 1978. The specific epithet refers to 
Kilauea, the type locality of the plant on the island of Hawaii. 
Based on a specimen collected in 1909 by Rock, St. John (1978) named 


O. konaensis. 

In the current treatment of the genus (Wagner 

et al. 


1990), 

O. konaensis 

is considered synonymous with 

O. kilaueaensis.

 



Ochrosia kilaueaensis 

of the dogbane family (Apocynaceae) is a 
hairless tree 49 to 59 ft (15 to 18 m) tall with milky sap. The 
lance- or ellipse-shaped toothless leaves are arranged three or four 
per node, are 2.4 to 7.5 in (6 to 19 cm) long and 0.9 to 2.6 in (2.2 
to 6.5 cm) wide, and have veins arising at nearly right angles to the 
midrib. Open clusters of numerous flowers have main stalks 1.8 to 
2.5 in (4.5 to 6.3 cm) long, secondary branches 0.4 to 1 in (1.1 to 
2.5 cm) long, and individual flower stalks 0.2 to 0.3 in (5 to 7 mm) 
long. Each flower has a five-lobed calyx about 0.4 in (10 to 11 mm) 
long and a trumpet-shaped greenish-white corolla with a tube 0.3 to 
0.4 in (7 to 11 mm) long and lobes 0.5 to 0.6 in (12 to 15 mm) long. 
The fruit is a drupe (a fruit with a firm outer layer, a fleshy inner 
layer, and a stony inner layer surrounding a single seed) thought to 
be yellowish brown at maturity, 1.8 to 1.9 in (4.5 to 4.9 cm) long, 
and 0.9 to 1.1 in (2.4 to 2.9 cm) wide. This species is 
distinguished from other Hawaiian species of the genus by the greater 
height of mature trees, the open flower clusters, the longer flower 
stalks, and the larger calyx and lobes of the corolla (Wagner 

et al.

 
1990).
