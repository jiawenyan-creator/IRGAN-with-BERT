<RINDOCK>Docket No. PL941000 (previously docketed as Docket No. RM9412000) </RINDOCK>



April 26, 1994.


On March 30, 1994, the Commission issued a notice (59 FR 16198, April 6, 1994) scheduling a public conference on May
26, 1994 in RM9412000 to examine the use of pricing differential mechanisms by interstate natural gas
pipelines to recover gas supply realignment costs. The Commission is redocketing this proceeding as Docket No. PL941000.


At the conference, the Commission would be interested in hearing commenters' views on the following issues: 

1. The pricing differential mechanisms were designed to lessen the pipelines' costs of renegotiating gas supply
contracts. The theory was that providing pipelines a means to honor existing contracts while they were being renegotiated
would be less expensive for consumers than requiring contracts to be bought out immediately. Has this theory been
validated? 

2. How are the pricing differential cost (PDC) mechanisms functioning? 

a. What impact, if any, do the PDC mechanisms have on pipelines' renegotiations with producers? 

b. While the pipelines have been recovering PDCs, what percentage of their overall contract volumes and costs have
been finally resolved? 

3. What impact, if any, does the two-year authorization have on the use of the PDC mechanisms? What type of review should
the Commission undertake to evaluate specific PDC mechanisms if a pipeline seeks to extend the authorization? If
the Commission were to extend a pipeline's 2-year authorization period, what effect would that have on your response
to question 1? 

4. Are there alternatives to the PDC mechanisms? 

a. If so what are they? 

b. What impact would these alternatives have on the timing of cost recovery? 

5. There are various procedural ways the Commission can deal with subsequent quarterly PDC filings where the first
filing has been set for hearing. Possible alternative approaches include: establishing new hearings; consolidating
new filings with the existing hearing; or, making subsequent filings subject to the first proceeding. Are there other
approaches that should also be considered? 

The Commission will provide for remote viewing of the conference in Hearing Room 1, 810 First Street, NE., Washington,
DC. In addition, if there is sufficient interest, the Capitol Connection may broadcast the conference in the Washington,
DC metropolitan area or nationally. Those interested in the local or national television broadcast should call The
