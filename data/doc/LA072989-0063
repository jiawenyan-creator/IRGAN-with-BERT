RAMS' PANKEY REJOINS TEAM 
Irv Pankey's holdout ended quickly and quietly Friday afternoon as the Rams' 
left tackle surprised everyone by signing a two-year contract. 
It couldn't have come at a better time for the team, which was facing an 
offensive line crisis. In three days, the Rams will depart for Tokyo and an 
exhibition game against the San Francisco 49ers Aug. 6 (Japan time). Pankey's 
signing gives the team three starters in the line to go with center Doug Smith 
and right tackle Jackie Slater. 
Still missing from the line, however, are starting right guard Duval Love, 
tackle Robert Cox and center-guard Tony Slaton. 
Details of Pankey's contract weren't revealed, but his agent said that no other 
Ram would make a higher base salary, which would put Pankey in the $450,000 to 
$500,000 range. 
Ram Notes 
Coach John Robinson said a move would be made today to clear room on the roster 
for Irv Pankey. . . . The Rams still have to sign four veterans -- running back 
Greg Bell, plus offensive linemen Duval Love, Robert Cox and Tony Slaton, and 
their two first-round picks, defensive end Bill Hawkins and running back 
Cleveland Gary. Tight end Damone Johnson is under contract but has not 
reported.CHRIS DUFRESNE
