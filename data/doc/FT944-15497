FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BS back to black with Pounds 0.4m and
returns to dividend list
BS Group, the property and leisure group formerly called Bristol Scotts, has
returned to profit for the first time since 1988 and will resume dividend
payments.
The shares rose 12p to 200p.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 429,000 in the six months to June 30, compared
with a deficit of Pounds 116,000 last time.
The interim dividend, the first since 1989, is 3p, payable from earnings of
6.87p (losses of 1.86p) per share.
Turnover expanded by a quarter to Pounds 5.41m (Pounds 4.31m) and margins
increased slightly. The improvement, however, largely reflects the disposal
of its lossmaking restaurants.
The board is engaged in a prolonged power struggle which saw Sir Ian Rankin
replace Mr Anthony Kerman as chairman in August. The Kerman family controls
a quarter of the company and is understood to have been recently approached
by Scotts Holdings, a Singapore property company. Sir Ian, who is seeking to
widen the BS share ownership by attracting institutional investment, is
opposed to any sale of the entire Kerman stake to the Singapore group.
Mr Kerman did not comment yesterday on the family's intentions.
Sir Ian said the group's liquidity had been greatly improved with the
elimination of short-term borrowings and the creation of cash reserves. 'The
company, having weathered the financial storm created by its London
restaurant businesses, is now ideally positioned to take advantage of the
numerous opportunities which are presenting themselves both in leisure and
property.'
