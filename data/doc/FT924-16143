FT  01 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Carpeting for Sir Leon
The European Commission decision to clear Du Pont's acquisition of the ICI
nylon business will surely leave Sir Sydney Lipworth chuckling into his
cornflakes. The chairman of the UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission, it
will be remembered, caused something of a stir earlier this year when he
suggested that Brussels' role in competition matters must be made more
transparent. Yesterday's case, which concerned the concentration of nylon
fibres for carpet making, appears to prove his point. Rumour and leaks have
created an impression that the EC's Merger Task Force made one
recommendation on competition grounds - and that the compromise solution now
announced by Sir Leon Brittan reflects wider considerations. It is too much
to expect politicians not to meddle, but not unreasonable to demand that
they tell us how they do it.
To be fair to Brussels, the EC authorities probably got the first bit right.
ICI and Du Pont argued fiercely that the regulators should look at the
polypropylene and nylon fibres market as a whole, but influenced no doubt by
squeals of protest from the carpet manufacturers the European Commission
decided that Du Pont's 43 per cent combined share was too much. The problem
is the tortuous set of undertakings intended to maintain competition, which,
as with the Nestle/Perrier conditions, contain alarming echoes of a
dirigiste industrial policy approach.
In mineral waters the idea was to create a third force in the French market.
This time the plan is that Du Pont will hand over production capacity and
R&amp;D facilities - comparable in quality to its own - to an as yet unnamed
third party. Quite how this will be policed is a mystery, but it seems a
safe bet that given its dependent status the new player will not provide as
effective competition for Du Pont as ICI has in the past.
