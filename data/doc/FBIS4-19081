  [Text] The Tirana government has asked Khristos Iakovou, 
the Greek consul general in Gjirokaster, to leave Albanian 
territory within 48 hours. The Albanian Government made this 
provocative decision following the badly devised provocation the 
other day about an alleged attack by Greeks against the guard 
post of Ano Episkopi [Peshkepia] near the Greek-Albanian border. 
In its decision to expel the Greek diplomat, the Albanian 
Government notes that his activities are incompatible with his 
duties. 
  Our Ioannina correspondent Yeoryios Kirousis has reported 
that Mr. Iakovou will leave Gjirokaster on Thursday [14 April]. 
The Greek consul's expulsion caused a reaction within the Greek 
minority but there have been no incidents. The assessment in 
the area is that the Sali Berisha government is trying to create 
an artificial tension in Greek-Albanian relations following the 
failure of the provocation about an alleged Greek attack against 
the Albanian military camp. The Tirana government is now trying 
to relate the expulsion of the Greek diplomat to the attack by 
unidentified gunmen in Ano Episkopi. 
  According to press reports, the first secretary of the 
Albanian Embassy in Athens will be expelled. The news report 
has also been carried by REUTER, which noted that, according to 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Konstandinos Bikas, the Greek 
Government made this decision as soon as it was informed that 
Greek Consul General in Gjirokaster Khristos Iakovou had been 
declared persona non grata and had been given 48 hours to leave 
Albania.
