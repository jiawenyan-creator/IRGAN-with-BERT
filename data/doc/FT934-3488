FT  08 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo edges higher as
region sets records
Investors were hesitant to sell shares against heightening prospects of a
further decline in interest rates, and the Nikkei average, which dropped 3.5
per cent on Monday, closed marginally higher on short-covering, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index regained 63.11 at 16,903.49. The Topix index of all
first section stocks, which fell 46.25 on Monday, picked up 6.75 to
1,420.61.
Traders said renewed hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate
kept investors from further selling. Hopes of monetary easing by the Bank of
Japan pushed down bond yields, and the No 157 10-year benchmark fell to a
low for the year of 3.145 per cent, although it closed unchanged on the day
at 3.165 per cent.
After declining to a day's low of 16,791.28 in the morning session, the
Nikkei gained ground on speculation of lower interest rates. The index fell
briefly on profit-taking, but was supported later by small-lot buying by
investment trust funds and foreign brokers which took it to a high of
17,128.81 in the afternoon.
Volume remained flat at 220m shares. Declines outscored advances by 536 to
455, with 156 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.39
to 1,157.61.
Professionals were absorbed with the domestic political situation and the
government's economic stimulus package. Some investors feared that the
government's likely decision to partially open Japan's rice market ahead of
the deadline of the Uruguay Round of multilateral talks might expose the
strains within the seven-party coalition, further delaying implementation of
the fiscal stimulus.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, indicated yesterday that he was
ready to accept a compromise agreement on rice, while members of the
Socialist party, staunchly opposed to the lifting of the rice ban,
reiterated threats to leave the coalition.
Foreign buying supported blue chip exporters. Matsushita Electric Industrial
put on Y20 at Y1,430 and Toshiba Y5 at Y646, while Toyota Motor advanced Y40
to Y1,750.
Daiichi Pharmaceutical recovered Y30 to Y1,420 and Yakult Honsha by Y50 to
Y2,267 after Daiichi denied reports that clinical tests of their new
anti-cancer drug had side effects that led to a high death rate in patients.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y9,000 and East Japan Railway gained
Y11,000 at Y422,000, both rising for the first time in three trading days.
In Osaka, the OSE average firmed 10.91 to 18,705.79 in volume of 16.6m
shares.
