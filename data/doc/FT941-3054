FT  17 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Program sales erase late Dow
advance
Wall Street
A late rally by blue chip stocks was stopped cold by a burst of program
trading, but reassuring news on inflation and a firm bond market helped to
bolster the broader range of equities, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 1.44 off at 3,848.15, after
surrendering a 15-point gain in the final minutes of trading. But the more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 held on to a 2.41 advance to end at
469.42. The American SE composite moved 1.69 higher to 469.82, while the
Nasdaq composite climbed 5.47 to 798.99, around a point off its all-time
closing high. NYSE volume was 306.8m shares.
It was a day of sudden shifts on Wall Street. Until late afternoon, equity
investors were unable to establish a clear direction in spite of a welcome
decline in long-term interest rates, as reflected in the yield on the
30-year Treasury issue.
The long bond's improvement reflected further evidence of subdued inflation.
The Labor Department followed up Tuesday's favourable report on February
producer prices with consumer price data which matched the consensus
forecast of analysts. The CPI was up 0.3 per cent last month.
By late in the day, the return on the long bond had dropped by as much as 7
basis points to 6.80 per cent. That seemed to be enough to shake the blue
chips out of their torpor, and the Dow industrials were showing strong gains
in the last two hours.
However, the bubble burst as quickly as it was inflated. The Dow finished on
a disappointing note when a wave of program selling was triggered just
before the close of trade.
Among cyclical stocks, whose performance is closely linked to economic
trends, Caterpillar shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 115 3/4 , but Cummins Engine
jumped Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 50 3/4 and DuPont gained Dollars 1 1/8 at
Dollars 57.
Transport issues were wanted, with the Dow Jones Transportation Average
pushed 17.88 higher to 1,752.38.
UAL, parent of United Airlines, gained Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 131 3/8
after a union representative said talks with management were still under
way, although the deadline for concluding the Dollars 5bn buyout deal had
passed.
Federal Express was up Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 71 7/8 and Roadway Services
added Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 73.
In the energy sector, Amoco climbed Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 54 5/8 after
Dean Witter Reynolds said that an expected restructuring could improve
profitability.
Nike surged Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 57 1/2 amid optimism over the company's
future. After the close of Tuesday's trading, the Oregon-based athletic shoe
manufacturer said worldwide orders for delivery during its first fiscal
quarter were 4 per cent ahead of 1993 levels.
Investors also bought US Surgical on expectations of an imminent return to
growth. The stock rose Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 18 3/8 after the company
said it would stay in the black during the rest of the year.
On the Nasdaq, Aldus leapt Dollars 6 to Dollars 32 1/4 after the
announcement of a merger between the software developer and Adobe Systems,
down Dollars 3 at Dollars 29 1/2 .
Canada
Toronto posted another sizeable gain in active trading. The TSE 300 index
closed 25.1 higher at 4,525.7 and rises led falls by 455 to 346 after volume
of 86.8m shares. The mining group gained 2.33 per cent.
