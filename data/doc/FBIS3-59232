  [Text] Air Force Command warplanes carried out an 
operation against the Zhalah camp of the terrorist PKK [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan] organization in northern Iraq. Heavy losses 
were inflicted on the PKK terrorists in the camp, who are 
believed to number around 1,600. 
  Fifty F-16 and F-4 warplanes, one reconnaissance plane, and 
five helicopters took part in the operation. The warplanes made 
52 sorties during close to 30 minutes. They dropped a total of 
132 bombs, including cluster bombs and 500- and 2,000-pound 
bombs. The photographs taken at the end of the operation show 
that the camp administrative units, as well as the ammunition 
depots and shelters, were destroyed. The planes returned safely 
to base. 
  At a briefing at the General Staff Headquarters this 
morning, 
Admiral Attila Tuzman, acting deputy chief of the General Staff,
