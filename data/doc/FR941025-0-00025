 

Revision 2 of the service bulletin revises certain test procedures for the thrust 
reverser system. 

Paragraph (c) of the final rule has been revised to reflect Revisions 1 and 2 of this 
service bulletin as additional sources of service information. 

The FAA has revised the applicability of the final rule to clarify its intent that the 
AD applies to Model 737300, 400, and 500 series airplanes equipped with CFM 
International CFM563 series engines. The applicability of the proposed rule stated 
incorrectly that Model 737300, 400, and 500 series airplanes equipped with General 
Electric CFM56 series engines were affected by this AD. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, 
the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the 
rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes 
will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the 
AD. 

It should be noted that no evidence currently exists that in-flight deployment of a 
thrust reverser was responsible for the accident involving a Boeing Model 737300 series 
airplane that occurred on September 8, 1994. 

There are approximately 1,079 Model 737 series airplanes of the affected design 
in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 531 airplanes of U.S. registry will be 
required to accomplish adjustments and tests of the thrust reverser system, installation of 
the sync-lock, and operational tests of the sync-lock installation. The FAA estimates that 
it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required 
adjustments and tests, 198 work hours to accomplish the required installation, and 1 work 
hour to accomplish the required operational tests. The average labor rate is $55 per work 
hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators of 
airplanes on which the sync-lock feature was not installed during production or as a 
modification is estimated to be $5,841,000, or $11,000 per airplane. 

The FAA estimates that 8 airplanes of U.S. registry will be required to accomplish 
adjustments and tests of the thrust reverser, modification of the sync-lock wiring, and 
operational tests of the sync-lock installation. The FAA estimates that it will take 
approximately 1 work hour to accomplish the required adjustments and tests, 70 work 
hours to accomplish the required wiring modification, and 1 work hour to accomplish the 
required operational tests. The average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these 
figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators of airplanes on which the sync-lock feature was installed
during production or as a modification is estimated to be 
$31,680, or $3,960 per airplane. 

Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is 
estimated to be $5,872,680. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 

The FAA recognizes the large number of work hours required to accomplish the 
modification. The 5-year compliance time specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this AD 
should allow the sync-lock installation and wiring modification to be accomplished 
coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, 
thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will 
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of 
small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has 
been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption
