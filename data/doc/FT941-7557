FT  24 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Good ad for the
industry
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the beleaguered advertising agency, can take some comfort
from figures due to be published tomorrow in Campaign, the advertising
industry journal.
Saatchi has lengthened its lead over all other UK agencies, with a 16 per
cent increase in billings for 1993. This appears to have been achieved at
the same time as a 3 per cent cut in staffing.
Unfortunately this performance is not matched by the agency in the US, where
Charles Scott, chief executive of the group, is wrestling with the structure
and attempting to attract new business. Just days ago it was disclosed that
Bob Kennedy, the former US Saatchi chief, had received a Pounds 4m pay-off
after just a year in the job.
Overall, the Campaign figures show significantly higher billings for the top
UK agencies, reflecting, says the journal, advertisers' growing confidence
in the economic recovery. The increase, as measured by the Register-Meal
tracking group, was 11 per cent during the year.
In second place, behind Saatchi's Pounds 264m of billings, comes Ogilvy and
Mather, part of the WPP group, with a 6 per cent increase to Pounds 197m. J
Walter Thompson, also part of WPP, slipped this year from second to third
place in the billings league, with Pounds 185m - a 5 per cent drop on 1992.
Abbott Mead Vickers climbed from eighth to fourth position, with a 28 per
cent increase to Pounds 180m.
Other strong performances during the year were from Kevin Morley Group (up
51 per cent); Butterfield Day Devito Hockney (up 75 per cent); and Howell
Henry Chaldecott Lury (up 72 per cent).
Saatchi was not the only agency to achieve a productivity increase last
year: across the top 30 agencies, productivity increased by 15 per cent from
billings per head of Pounds 520,000 in 1992 to Pounds 597,000 last year.
