  [Text] Paris, April 12 (AFP) -- France has demanded that 
11 of its aid workers held by Bosnian Serbs near Sarajevo be 
released, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Richard Duque said Tuesday 
[12 April]. 
  The eleven, 10 men and one woman from the nongovernmental 
relief agency Premiere Urgence (First Aid), were held last 
Friday by Serbian militia at Ilidza, near Sarajevo, accused of 
transporting arms in their seven-truck relief convoy carrying 
supplies from Europe. 
  Duque said: "We cannot accept these allegations, Premiere 
Urgence has a strictly humanitarian vocation." 
  He said his ministry had complained to the Belgrade 
government and to Bosnian Serb representatives there.
