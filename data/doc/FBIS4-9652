  [Text] The declaration on the government's intentions 
until the end of the year, presented by Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov in parliament, the subsequent ultimatum-like statements of 
the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], the attempts to apply 
pressure to effect certain personnel and structural changes in 
the cabinet, and the attempts to blame specific members of the 
cabinet for the situation, especially Deputy Prime Minister 
Karabashev, only demonstrate political ambitions aimed at 
implementing narrow party interests. This is pointed out in a 
declaration of the parliamentary faction of the New Alliance for 
Democracy [NSD], sent to BTA by its Cochairman Stefan Bozhilov. 
  According to the document, the NSD will not participate in 
the talks on structural and personnel changes in the cabinet. 
  Professor Petur Markov, member of the NSD parliamentary 
faction, told a BTA correspondent that this declaration reflects 
the opinion of only a part of the NSD parliamentarians. He said 
he does not support the declaration.
