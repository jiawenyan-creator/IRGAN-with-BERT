FT  28 FEB 92 / Arts: Today's Television
ITV shows the first episode of Growing Rich, a 6-part drama specially
written for television (rather than being adapted from one of her novels) by
Fay Weldon. After 'Life And Loves Of A She Devil' and 'The Cloning Of Joanna
May' we can expect it to be anti-male and to mix naturalism and mysticism.
We are also entitled to expect a high level of entertainment. The story is
said to be of three girls, desperate to escape the tedium of a small East
Anglian town, with the devil featuring large in the form of a sexy chauffeur
(9.00).
Public Eye screens the second part of Peter Taylor's report on London's
notorious Brixton Prison (8.00 BBC2). Channel 4 begins a series of half-hour
documentaries made by directors new to television, Short Stories. Today's
programme, 'Learning To Be Ladies", is about a finishing school in Farnham
where young women from Japan and South America learn flower arranging and
table manners at Pounds 4000 a term (8.30).
Arena tells the story of Dean Read, 'the biggest rock star the communist
world had ever seen' who, in 1986, was found dead in a lake in East Berlin
in 'mysterious circumstances'. Dean who?
