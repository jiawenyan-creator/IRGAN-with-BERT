FT  22 JAN 93 / Czechs buy up foreign currency
Foreign currency reserves of the Czech central bank fell from Dollars 847m
to Dollars 482m in the three weeks since the separation from Slovakia,
writes Patrick Blum from Prague. The drain reflects a strong demand for
foreign currency from commercial banks in response to the demand for hard
currency from individuals and companies nervous about the expected split of
the former Czechoslovak currency into Czech and Slovak crowns.
The decline in central bank reserves has not led to an outflow of reserves
from the banking system as a whole. The Slovak central bank has reported
similar decline in foreign currency reserves with many Slovak citizens
buying hard currency believing the Slovak crown will be devalued once the
split, originally scheduled for mid-year but now expected sooner, takes
place.
