  [Text] Shenyang, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Each farmer in 
Liaoning Province, northeast China, can now spend an additional 
40 yuan per year on daily necessities, since the provincial 
government has lessened farmers' financial burdens. 
  The province, with a rural population of 20 million, cut a 
total of 800 million yuan from random charges assessed to 
farmers last year. 
  An average of five percent of a farmer's annual income goes 
into the province's coffers. 
  In light of the documents issued by the State Council to 
lighten farmers' financial burdens, the province lowered the 
ceiling for total fees for farmers in 1993 by some 300 million 
yuan from the previous year's figure. 
  The province gives farmers booklets on which types of 
charges 
and amounts are listed so that farmers may understand their 
rights and responsibilities better. Farmers may refuse to hand 
in any extra charges which are not noted in the booklet. 
  The province also is easing farmers' financial burdens by 
putting an end to random charges demanded by governments at 
grassroots levels, reducing government personnel and tightening 
up regulations against random charges assessed to farmers.
