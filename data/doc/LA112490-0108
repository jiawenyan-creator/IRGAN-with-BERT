BODIES OF MOTEL EXECUTIVE, PASSENGER FOUND IN WRECKED PLANE IN ARIZONA 
The body of Thousand Oaks motel executive William Crimmins, described by 
friends as an excellent pilot, was found Friday along with the body of a woman 
passenger in the burned wreckage of his single-engine airplane in the mountains 
near Kingman, Ariz., officials with the Arizona Civil Air Patrol said. 
Crimmins, 57, and passenger Lavonne DeSchpper had taken off from South Dakota 
and were reported missing Monday when they failed to land in Thermal, Calif., 
where DeSchpper was planning to spend Thanksgiving with friends. 
They were last seen Monday evening leaving an airport at Grand Junction, Colo. 
A search by the Civil Air Patrols of California and Arizona began Tuesday and 
ended Friday afternoon, when one of the crews saw the wreckage from the air 
about 8,400 feet up the side of a mountain southeast of Kingman. 
Crimmins, a vice president of Motel 6, and DeSchpper died instantly and the 
plane's emergency locater transmitter was destroyed on impact, said Joyce 
Kienitz, public affairs officer for the Arizona Civil Air Patrol. 
Kienitz said that it is unclear what might have caused the crash, but that 
Crimmins was "a very safety-conscious pilot who didn't seem the type to travel 
in bad weather." The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the 
crash.
