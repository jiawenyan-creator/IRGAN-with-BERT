  [Text] If no extraordinary health problems or other 
essential reasons emerge, Todor Zhivkov [former Bulgarian 
Communist Party leader] will have to go to prison within three 
days. This became clear today after the Supreme Court confirmed 
his seven-year prison term in connection with Case No. 1 of 
1992. In addition to the prison term Zhivkov will have to 
compensate the state to the tune of 22 million leva. The other 
defendant in the same case, Milko Balev [former Politburo member 
and Central Committee secretary] was given an 18-month suspended 
sentence and was put on probation for four years.
