FT  18 MAR 94 / Legal move on Crest deals
The Treasury believes it will be necessary to alter the UK Companies Act in
order to protect shareholders settling their trades through the Crest system
for paperless settlement which is under development by the Bank of England.
Because share ownership will no longer be demonstrable by the production of
share certificates, there will have to be new regulations to protect those
who buy and sell shares.
Crest should have the authority to take legal action against participants
who cause losses through negligence, fraud or by going into default.
The Treasury has also proposed:
Removing the obligation of a company to issue a share certificate to a
shareholder, but only in instances where the shareholder indicates he does
not wish to receive one.
A new legal structure to protect buyers of securities in a paperless system
during the period between striking the bargain and the settlement date. A
law to give buyers a so-called 'equitable interest' in the shares they have
purchased as soon as a registrar has received instructions for a transfer of
ownership. If the registrar is unable to complete the transfer of ownership,
the buyer will still have a claim.
