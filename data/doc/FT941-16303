FT  11 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No case for holding up Nato expansion
(1)
Sir, Anticipating the outcome of the Nato summit, Jurek Martin echoes the
doubts of some US defence planners opposed to full Nato membership for
central Europe on grounds of 'the security implications of sharing
operational knowledge with countries whose political futures as
western-inclined democracies could not be assured' ('Still chairman of the
board', January 8-9).
The problem with this approach is that it amounts to a self-fulfilling
prophecy. Surely the best way to ensure that the Visegrad Four states
(Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic) remain politically and
strategically committed to the west is to reciprocate the overtures of those
within these countries who have made this their goal, thereby strengthening
their domestic position? Appearing aloof or indifferent achieves the
opposite, by playing into the hands of politicians keen to use the pretext
of 'western betrayal' to popularise nationalist alternatives.
This does not mean that Nato should immediately open its doors to countries
still militarily unready for full membership. It does mean, however, that
the alliance should strive to close this gap with the most plausible
applicants in the shortest possible time, while reassuring them that they
are not being consigned to some strategic limbo.
