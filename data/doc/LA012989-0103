Jurors in the sixth day of deliberations showed signs of voting to acquit 
accused child killer Joel Steinberg of murder and of considering a lesser 
charge of manslaughter. The jury in Manhattan sent out a note asking Acting 
Justice Harold Rothwax to repeat his instructions for reaching a verdict on 
manslaughter. Earlier last week, Rothwax told the jury it was not permitted to 
"consider" the less serious homicide charges until it reaches a unanimous 
decision to acquit Steinberg of murder. The jury deliberated until 7 p.m. 
without announcing a verdict and was to resume this morning. Steinberg, 47, a 
disbarred lawyer, was accused of fatally beating his illegally adopted 
6-year-old daughter, Lisa. For a first-degree manslaughter conviction, the jury 
must find that Steinberg intended to cause serious physical injury without 
intending to kill Lisa -- but that in the act of causing serious injury he 
caused her death.
