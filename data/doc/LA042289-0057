FUSS OVER ETHICS AND OFFICEHOLDERS 
At least one of the charges of the House Ethics Committee regarding the conduct 
of Wright portends an interesting philosophical question: In the minds of the 
goose and gander, is that which is good for one necessarily good for the other? 
One thing my mother never let me forget was that my father never would pay her 
poll tax. One was a Lincoln Republican, and the other was a Roosevelt Democrat. 
My father said that he didn't want my mother to kill his vote, and my mother 
said that she might have voted like he wanted her to vote, but that she wasn't 
going to let him tell her how to vote. 
I reckon it's insignificant to the point of this letter, but mother always 
finished that story by saying that on the first election day after the poll tax 
was abolished and she could have voted, dad took her fishing.
