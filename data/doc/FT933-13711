FT  17 JUL 93 / International Company News: Volkswagen 'will return to
profit in 1994'
VOLKSWAGEN will return to profit in 1994 even if demand for cars does not
improve and turnover remains unchanged, Mr Werner Schmidt, group finance
director, claimed yesterday.
Sales fell 12 per cent in the first six months of the current year to just
under DM39bn (Dollars 22.6bn), he added, and would reach DM80bn 'with a
little luck' in the full 12 months, compared with DM85.4bn in 1992.
Deliveries of vehicles had also fallen 12 per cent at the half-way mark to
1.63m units, Mr Schmidt said.
The increased strength of the US dollar would have a positive effect,
although because of a sharp fall in US deliveries, the Volkswagen of America
subsidiary would again suffer heavy losses.
Last year, when group profits plunged 87 per cent to DM142m, the US business
lost DM100m.
Seat, the Spanish business, was also heading for a further deficit after
losing DM180m in 1992, Mr Schmidt said.
VW has repeatedly stated that it expected to return to profit in the third
quarter of this year and break-even overall, in spite of a DM1.25bn loss in
the first quarter.
The group has implemented job cuts and other cost-cutting and improved
efficiency measures.
