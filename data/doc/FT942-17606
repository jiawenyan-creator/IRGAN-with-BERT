FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Adjournment puts Heron creditors in
confusion
Creditors of Heron International were left in confusion on Thursday, after
meetings of senior and junior bondholders were adjourned in the absence of a
quorum. The meetings were held to approve a deferral of interest payments
due on Thursday until the end of June.
With the interest left unpaid, the bonds are technically in default, though
as yet no creditor has moved against the company. Under the terms of the
trust deeds, holders of at least 25 per cent of the bonds can ask the
Trustee to act.
Holders of 35 per cent of the bonds either attended the meeting or voted by
proxy, but the quorum required was at least 50 per cent. The meetings were
therefore adjourned and will be called again, probably towards the end of
April. At least 14 days notice is required. At the reassembled meetings the
quorum is two holders, whatever the value of the bonds they hold.
Heron had warned that without the interest deferral, and the postponement of
other payments due, the property and trading group might be unable to
continue trading.
In a separate development, Heron Properties, the US arm of Heron which was
detached from the group under last year's refinancing, is being sued in the
New York Supreme Court by Stratagem Development Corporation.
Stratagem - which is also suing nine banks and four people, including Mr
Gerald Ronson, chief executive of Heron International, and its head Mr Simon
Shane - and Heron have been embroiled in litigation for some years.
Stratagem is asking the US court to set aside the restructuring of the US
companies on the grounds that it constituted 'an unlawful fraudulent
conveyance'. It asserts that Heron Properties gave security over assets to
the nine defendant banks with the intent of preventing the payment of
unsecured creditors such as Stratagem.
