EDISON'S EXCESS PLANTS 'INEFFICIENT,' REPORT SAYS 
Southern California Edison's excess electric generating plants -- which would 
be returned to service after a proposed merger with San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric -- are described as old, inefficient and undependable in an August, 
1988, SDG&amp;E document released Thursday by order of the state Public 
Utilities Commission. 
According to the document, an unidentified SDG&amp;E electrical generation 
expert viewed Edison's "mothballed" power plants, which can generate an 
estimated 900 megawatts of electricity, as "old units, with poor heat 
rates/operating records, which do not make the cut on economics compared to 
adding new generation. 
They may also not meet air quality standards." 
Utility officials have said that some of the proposed merger's savings would be 
created by returning Edison's excess power plants to service. That move 
supposedly would cut electric rates by delaying construction of costly new 
power plants in SDG&amp;E's service territory. 
"This is really is an astounding document," said Michael Shames, executive 
director of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group. 
"When it comes to the deferral of plant generation, they're saying (cost 
savings) really aren't there." 
But SDG&amp;E vice president Ed Guiles downplayed the importance of the 
document. 
"We probably didn't have a clear, detailed, knowledgeable vision" of Edison's 
power plant plans when the document was prepared, Guiles said. The document was 
apparently prepared just days after Edison surprised SDG&amp;E with an 
uninvited merger bid in August, 1988. 
"At the time, it was probably questionable (to the staff person preparing the 
document) whether it was reasonable for (Edison's) excess capacity to fill our 
needs," Guiles said. Edison has since drafted a "reasonable plan" that includes 
capital expenditures that would bolster the plants' efficiency and address 
environmental concerns, he said.
