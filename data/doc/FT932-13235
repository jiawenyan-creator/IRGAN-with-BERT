FT  24 APR 93 / Former Bank of Italy chief dies
WITH the death of Mr Guido Carli yesterday at his Spoleto home at the age of
79, Italy has lost one of the few great post-war servants of state.
In a distinguished career spanning almost 50 years in both the public and
private sector, he will be best remembered for his long term as governor of
the Bank of Italy from 1960-75. This was a key period during which Italy
became one the world's seven leading industrialised economies.
Yesterday the Italian establishment united in paying tribute to Mr Carli,
highlighting his integrity and his contribution to Italy's postwar economic
development. Trained as a lawyer and gaining the Military Cross during the
second world war, he joined the Bank of Italy in 1946. He took part in the
Bretton Woods negotiations setting up the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank, and was subsequently the first Italian executive director of the
IMF.
After leaving the governorship of the Bank of Italy, Mr Carli took on the
presidency of Confindustria, the industrialists' association, for four years
at a time of confrontation between management and unions.
In 1983 he became a Christian Democrat senator, and in 1989 treasury
minister. Here he was instrumental in boosting the treasury team, pressing
for Italy's inclusion in the European Monetary System and a start to
privatisation.
Although he gave considerable international credibility to the Andreotti
government's economic policies, he never hid his disappointment that so
little was done either to privatise or to reduce Italy's mountain of debt.
