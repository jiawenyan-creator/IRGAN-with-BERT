  [Text] According to Seoul radio reports, on 22 April, 
puppet Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang tendered his resignation to 
the Chongwadae [presidential office] after serving only four 
months in office. Stunned, the ruling Democratic Liberal Party 
denounced his act as irresponsible. 
  In the meantime, opposition Democratic Party leader Yi 
Ki-taek, who is visiting the United States, held an emergency 
news conference regarding the resignation of the puppet prime 
minister and demanded the resignation of the entire puppet 
cabinet in the wake of the puppet prime minister's resignation. 
He expressed a strong opposition to the fact that traitor Kim 
Yong-sam has designated Yi Yong-tok, current deputy prime 
minister and unification minister, as the new puppet prime 
minister, and revealed that he will vote in the National 
Assembly against Yi Yong-tok as the new puppet prime minister. 
  The puppet prime minister's surprising resignation clearly 
shows that the Kim Yong-sam regime is floundering in an impasse 
it created itself while committing flunkeyist traitorous acts.
