FT  15 SEP 92 / Midland to offer equity finance
MIDLAND Bank will offer equity finance nationally this month to its banking
customers. It plans to provide funds of between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds
750,000 to fill a gap for smaller amounts of finance left by the venture
capital industry.
Previous attempts by clearing banks to provide equity directly to banking
customers have failed, although all have venture capital subsidiaries.
National Westminster Bank merged its direct equity department with County
NatWest Ventures, its venture capital arm, last year after failing to
establish a viable operation.
Midland says it will employ venture capitalists rather than bankers to
assess and monitor investments. Bank managers will be briefed on the type of
customer best suited for equity finance.
The bank will provide ordinary and preference equity as well as loans to
established, profitable small businesses. It will normally appoint a
non-executive director to the company's board.
Mr David McMeekin, corporate finance director of Midland corporate banking,
said Midland expected to invest in between 12 and 20 companies a year.
The bank previously failed to raise outside finance for 11 regional venture
capital funds it hoped to create.
The recession and doubts about the returns from venture capital made it
difficult for Midland to raise the money from local investors. It will now
launch just two funds, covering the east Midlands and the Yorkshire and
Humberside area, providing amounts between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 250,000.
For its nationwide network of enterprise funds, Midland established links
with 700 professional firms in the regions that offered services below
normal rates to the investee companies. Those firms are expected to advise
and monitor the companies that which receive funding under the growth
capital scheme.
The creation of that scheme and of the enterprise funds is intended to give
Midland complete coverage of the venture capital spectrum.
