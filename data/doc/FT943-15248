FT  11 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Protocol guides move quietly
Among thousands of World Cup volunteers, there is a select group that says
it is better to be seen than heard. World Cup 'protocol ambassadors' move
quietly among groups of foreign politicians and diplomats who are visiting
the US to watch their countries play soccer.
'It is a heady responsibility,' says Marianne Ward, chief of protocol for
the World Cup venue at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. 'The
protocol ambassador may be the closest that these dignitaries come to an
everyday American.'
Protocol ambassadors are at each of the nine World Cup sites. They are
responsible for meeting foreign VIPs at airports and guiding them through
their visit.
Sam Destito, a lawyer, said he became a protocol ambassador because he felt
the world was issuing a challenge to America. 'I don't think the rest of the
world thought America could handle the responsibility of the World Cup
games,' Destito said. 'Now visitors compliment me on our country's ability.'
