FT  08 SEP 93 / Observer: Canada dry
By her own admission, Kim Campbell has little in common with the
stereotypical vest-clad Canadian nursing his beer in front of the
television. But Canada's cello-playing prime minister is now working hard to
shed her image as an aloof and testy intellectual, ahead of the general
election which she is expected to call today for October 25.
Campbell has spent the past few weeks putting in appearances at baseball
matches, barbecues and even a Highland dancing festival; her impish sense of
humour has been much in evidence. She told one group of supporters that she
has had difficulty since the G7 meeting in Tokyo last July fitting the prime
ministerial bottom into the prime ministerial skirt.
The question is whether such bons mots will be enough to swing voters behind
her Conservative party in the election.
The Liberals' leader, Jean Chretien, 60, has followed Campbell's lead in
putting style above substance. Stung by criticism that he is yesterday's man
after 30 years in politics, Chretien made sure photographers were on hand
recently to record him churning up the waves on a single water-ski.
