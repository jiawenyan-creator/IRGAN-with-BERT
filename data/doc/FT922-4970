FT  03 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Mexican steel dumping cases brought
against US
THE Mexican government has initiated anti-dumping cases against flat-rolled
steel producers in the US, Damian Fraser reports from Mexico City. Mexico
would be able to impose countervailing duties on all US flat steel producers
if the claims are upheld.
Its two flat steel producers, Hysla and Altos Hornos, brought the case
against USX, National, LTV and Bethlehem, and two US trading companies. They
claim the US companies have been selling hot-rolled, cold-rolled and
plate-in-coil steel below cost, making it impossible for the Mexicans to
compete fairly.
Mexico, unlike the US, has been unwilling until now to use its anti-dumping
laws. US cement companies brought a case against Mexican cement exporters
two years ago. The Mexicans suffered countervailing duties, and have since
been effectively blocked out of the US market. The cement case encouraged
the Mexicans to press for a reform of the US anti-dumping laws as part of
the North American Free Trade Agreement. But the US refused to budge.
