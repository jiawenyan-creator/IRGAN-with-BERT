  [Text] Russia's Minister for Fuel and Energy Yuriy 
Shafranik told Interfax in an exclusive interview that the role 
of the state was overly exaggerated in the sphere of energy 
supplies. He believes that this is a matter of relations 
between the suppliers and consumers not only in Russia but also 
abroad, including the CIS countries. 
  He categorically denied the assertions that Russia was 
manipulating difficulties in this sphere in order to save energy 
for its own needs. 
  We must get used to the idea that according to the market 
laws energy supplies must be regulated during talks between the 
supplier and consumer. The state, including the Ministry for 
Energy and Fuel, must not be involved in tackling such problems. 
  Speaking about cuts in Russian gas exports to Ukraine, he 
emphasized that they had been caused by the Ukrainian consumers' 
debts, not by problems in Russian-Ukrainian relations.
