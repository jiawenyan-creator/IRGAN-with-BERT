<F P=106> [Interview with IAEA spokesman David Kyd by Katinka Novotny; </F>
place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Novotny] After 10 rounds of talks between the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea last 
year, North Korea finally showed flexibility and agreed to allow 
the inspection of part of its nuclear facilities. Why are these 
inspections so important, and what information do you expect to 
obtain on North Korea's nuclear program? 
  [Kyd] First of all, it is very important for us to be able 
to carry out another inspection. After one year of absence, it 
is urgently necessary and high time to resume activities in 
North Korea. For us it is important to find out whether North 
Korea has produced or otherwise obtained plutonium for military 
or other purposes in the past 12 months. This is the main goal 
of our inspection. We also want to make preparations so that 
additional inspections can take place in the future. 
  [Novotny] What are your suspicions? Do you believe that 
North Korea is in the process of building an atomic bomb or that 
it even possesses one? 
  [Kyd] This is not our task. Our task is to find out how 
much plutonium has been produced, how much plutonium Korea 
possesses, and whether the amount would be sufficient to build a 
bomb. We are not the political rulers. We are the police, as 
it were. We can carry out investigations, however the 
politicians have to assess them. 
  [Novotny] The regime in Pyongyang has always been very 
imaginative in covering up and concealing the existence of its 
secret facilities. How useful are inspections if two secret 
nuclear plants where the atomic bomb might be built cannot be 
inspected? 
  [Kyd] Well, you must understand that one cannot expect to be 
granted everything at once if one wants to resume activities 
after 12 months. Otherwise another year might pass before an 
agreement is concluded. We now have reached an agreement with 
North Korea, and we can continue our work. Yet if we had 
demanded everything at once, then it would have been impossible 
to return to North Korea, particularly because we know that 
officials there refused access to these two plants in the past. 
Our inspection is an initial step. The path ahead will be very 
long and very tough. Thus, our mission is only an initial 
phase, but a very important one that is absolutely necessary.
