FT  30 JUL 92 / Letter: Local customs
Sir, With reference to your article 'On Parade' (July 14) and at the risk of
disagreeing with Mr Algosaibi (Letters, July 16), I have been travelling
between the UK and Saudi Arabia for many years, and I now know the
customs/immigration system well enough to negotiate it within 20 minutes,
without special treatment. Is this is a marketable service?
