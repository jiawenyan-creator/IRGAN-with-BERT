  [Text] Osaka, March 28 KYODO -- A new substance that could 
help make everyday electronic devices smaller has been developed 
by researchers at Osaka University. 
  Tomoji Kawai, a professor at the university's Institute of 
Scientific and Industrial Research, said Monday that the 
ferroelectric substance is an artificial crystal superlattice 
membrane. The substance can be used in appliances in which an 
electrical impulse from an integrated circuit is changed into 
sound or vibrations. 
  Kawai said the findings will be presented at a three-day 
annual meeting of the Chemical Society of Japan in Tokyo 
beginning Monday. 
  The new substance, which retains its ability to conduct 
electricity at high temperatures, is made by condensing 
vaporized barium titanate and strontium titanate subjected to 
laser beams. 
  It consists of alternate layers of barium titanate and 
strontium titanate molecules with a thickness of 0.2 micron. 
One micron is a millionth of a meter. 
  Crystalline substances which are ferroelectric have 
commercial applications because of their capacity for 
spontaneous electric polarization reversible by an electric 
field. 
  Since the lengths of the crystalline molecules of the two 
substances differ only slightly, when they are interfaced in the 
layers they generate an extremely powerful lateral strain. 
  Under this strain, the barium titanate crystals are 
stretched 
vertically, making it easy for the atoms to move in a vertical 
axis and increasing the substance's ferroelectric properties. 
Kawai and his team describe the new "strained superlattices" as 
having "superdielectric" properties.
