FT  22 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Interest rate worries help to
depress Dow
Wall Street
US stocks retreated yesterday amid anxieties over interest rates and the
Christmas retailing season, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 10.06 lower at 3,745.15, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.55 to 465.30. In the secondary markets, the
American SE composite was off 3.31 at 460.77 and the Nasdaq composite shed
4.52 to 755.63. New York SE volume was 273m shares and declining issues
outpaced advances by 1,202 to 889.
After the previous session failed to build substantially on last week's late
rally, equities opened on a shaky footing with investors preoccupied with
the events in the US Treasury market. In late trading the bellwether 30-year
government bond was down just  1/16 at 99 7/32 , recovering from the
session's low after the monthly auction of two-year notes generated greater
demand than had been expected.
However, traders remained anxious about the outcome of a Federal Reserve
policy-making session being held in Washington. Although minutes of the
meeting would not be forthcoming for weeks, any hint that the Fed was
shifting its stance towards tighter money could send a shiver through the
bond market and in turn rattle stocks in the run-up to Christmas.
Against this backdrop, several blue chip issues moved lower. 3M was down
Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 119 7/8 , Alcoa Dollars 1 1/4 off at Dollars 68 3/8
and Cummins Engine Dollars 1 1/4 cheaper at Dollars 50 1/2 .
Equity investors drew mixed signals from the weekly Johnson Redbook Service
report, which showed retail sales in the third week of December, on a
seasonally adjusted basis, down 1.7 per cent from November, but up 7.1 per
cent from the year-ago level.
Many of the big store groups finished in the loss column. Sears Roebuck
slipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 53 5/8 , JC Penney Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars
51 1/2 and May Department Stores Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 38 7/8 , but
Carter Hawley Hale picked up Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 9 3/8 .
Ford outperformed the market, advancing Dollars 2 to Dollars 64 3/4 after
Merrill Lynch raised its earnings estimate. General Motors appreciated
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 54 7/8 .
Shares in the two companies vying for Paramount Communications were active
after QVC said its revised Dollars 10.5bn offer was greater than Viacom's
new bid. QVC was Dollars 1 1/2 lower at Dollars 42 amid concern over the
deal's impact on existing shareholders. Viacom 'B' shares eased Dollars  1/8
to Dollars 45 1/8. The target company's stock shed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars
80 1/4.
On the Amex, Greyhound Lines dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 11 1/2 after
the bus company said its earnings would fall short of 1992 levels because of
fare discounting.
On the Nasdaq, Banyan Systems plunged Dollars 11 1/8 to Dollars 14 1/2
following a profits warning by the software concern.

Toronto closed lower after relatively moderate trading. The TSE 300 index
declined 8.9 to 4,214.7 and falls outnumbered rises by 460 to 383. Volume
amounted to 67.3m shares valued at CDollars 730.9m.
Eight of the 14 sub-indices lost ground, led by the golds sector, off 1.6
per cent as the bullion price in New York shed USDollars 1.50 to USDollars
387.75 an ounce.
