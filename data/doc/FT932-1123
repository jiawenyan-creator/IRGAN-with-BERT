FT  25 JUN 93 / German exports to Europe may fall
GERMAN exports to Europe could decline by 1.5 per cent this year but North
America and Asia will offer good trade prospects, the German chambers of
commerce and industry (DIHT) said yesterday.
In a survey of its chambers of commerce and trade representatives in 52
countries, the DIHT said exports to the European Community, which account
for 55 per cent of Germany's exports, are expected to fall by 1 per cent.
Exports to countries in the European Free Trade Association could fall
slightly more.
The report indicates that exports to North America could grow this year by 4
to 5 per cent, as German competitiveness is enhanced by a strong dollar. In
Latin America, exports are likely to grow by 8 per cent after a 6.2 per cent
rise in 1992.
The report also shows good prospects for exports to Asian countries, except
Japan. Exports to the Pacific rim could grow by 3 per cent this year but a
sharp fall will continue to characterise exports to recession-struck Japan,
particularly for luxury goods.
German imports from the EC, which account for three-fifths of Germany's
imports, could fall by 2 per cent, the report noted. But the strong reliance
of east European countries on Germany will continue to rise. Thirty per cent
of exports from Hungary, Poland, the Czech republic and Slovakia go to
Germany.
Meanwhile the Munich-based economic institute, Ifo, said business confidence
was rising in Germany despite the continuing downturn in the economy. It
also noted that many enterprises were expecting improved export conditions
worldwide.
In its monthly survey of manufacturers, distributors and building companies,
Ifo said that 'fewer enterprises were now pessimistic about the economic
prospects for Germany'.
