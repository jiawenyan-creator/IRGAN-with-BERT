  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 09, BNS -- Having attained 
independence, Ukraine will be able to become the third big 
Slavic country in Europe, Lithuanian MP [member of parliament] 
Romualdas Ozolas told a news conference Wednesday [9 February]. 
  In Ozolas' view, together with Poland, Ukraine could 
guarantee stability in Central Europe. The lawmaker said it 
would be expedient to create a security space in Central Europe 
but not a Baltic-Black sea axis. "If an axis is necessary, we 
must talk about an axis from Helsinki to Athens." 
  Ozolas said the role of Poland would considerably increase 
in 
such case and this is why Lithuania needs to clear up its 
relations with Poles. If Lithuania agrees to sign an agreement 
on friendship and cooperation with Poland without even 
mentioning the 1920 occupation of Vilnius and its region by 
Poland, this will mean capitulation, he said. History can be 
presented in a form acceptable to both sides, the lawmaker said. 
  Commenting on a seminar of Baltic and Nordic lawmakers in 
Riga last week, Ozolas said its participants pointed out a sharp 
turn in Russia's policy with respect to the Baltic states. He 
said the change can be regarded as "a stage of the cold war." 
  Ozolas said Russia's unwillingness to withdraw its troops 
from Latvia and Estonia proves that deoccupation slows down and 
tendencies of militarization begin to emerge. "Kaliningrad 
covers Lithuania, St. Petersburg -- Estonia, and the Skrunda 
base in Latvia would be the third point." 
  He said the Riga seminar agreed that an agreement on Russian 
military transit would lead toward military cooperation with 
Russia.
