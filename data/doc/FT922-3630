FT  10 JUN 92 / Rigs' riches
petrol prices are set to reach a record as Esso and Shell today add 4.5p to
the price of a gallon, Neil Buckley writes. Their new benchmark price of
245p for a gallon of 4-star surpasses even the high set during the Gulf war.
BP Oil will decide today whether to follow suit, and Mobil and Texaco are
also considering their position. Maximum prices for Esso and Shell petrol
will be 245p a gallon for 4-star (53.9p a litre), 225p a gallon for unleaded
and 234.1p a gallon for superplus unleaded. BP's Miller Field (above), 160
miles north-east of Aberdeen, began oil production on Monday. Oil production
is set to peak at 113,000 barrels a day with gas production scheduled to
start next month.
