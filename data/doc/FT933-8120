FT  18 AUG 93 / Financial cowboys' DM400m round-up
TWO former managers of an eastern German savings bank went on trial in Halle
yesterday charged with misappropriation of funds in one of the biggest
financial scams in Germany since unification in 1990.
At the centre of the case is the Stadt und Saalkreissparkasse Halle, the
local savings bank, whose staff unwittingly granted more than DM400m (Pounds
160m) credits during the summer of 1990 to what one banker yesterday
described as 'cowboys'. At the time, eastern German banks were flush with
cash after millions of east Germans had cashed in their Ost Marks for
D-Marks.
To the young, unsuspecting east German staff at the savings bank the west
German businessmen who approached them for loans were beyond reproach. The
staff, untrained, inexperienced, and lacking a competent management, had
little idea of which credentials or collateral to ask for, despite the size
of the loans requested.
The Halle bank issued 10 loans to the west German businessmen, whose real
identities have never been established. They relied on the ubiquitous
Stempel - the rubber stamp - to establish their status. 'Letters' of
recommendation with the appropriate institutional stamps were enough to
persuade the staff to part with DM400m.
'This is an unfortunate case,' said Mr Harmut Forndran, an official at the
German savings banks' association. 'It took place just after monetary union.
There was no infrastructure in the eastern German banking system. No
management.'
Since late 1990, west German banks have introduced training courses, western
managers sit on most of the eastern German bank boards, and the chances for
scams - at least across the counter - are rare.
The authorities have managed to recover DM170m. 'The rest of it is probably
outside the country,' said Mr Forndran.
