JET LANDS AFTER BIRD IS SUCKED INTO ENGINE 
A United Airlines DC-10 flying from New York's Kennedy Airport to San Francisco 
made an emergency landing at O'Hare International Airport Thursday after a bird 
was sucked into an engine of the giant plane. 
"The pilot shut down the No. 1 engine and asked to divert to Chicago," said 
Midwest FAA spokesman Mort Edelstein. The plane landed without incident at 9:58 
a.m. as emergency crews lined the runway. 
None of the 265 passengers or 10 crew members were injured. The passengers were 
transferred to a later flight from Chicago to San Francisco.
