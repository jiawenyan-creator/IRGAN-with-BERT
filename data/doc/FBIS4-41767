  [Text] Baku (June 27) TURAN -- On June 23 the opposition 
leaders of Azerbaijan -- Nadzhaf Nadzhafov (PFA) [People's Front 
of Azerbaijan], Asim Mollazade (PFA) and Sabit Bagirov (Musavat) 
returned from the trip to the US, which has been lasting for ten 
days. They were invited by the National Democratic Institute. 
  The Deputy of Supreme Soviet, the member of the PFA 
Consultative Council, Nadzhaf Nadzhafov said that the trip was 
very fruitful. The members of the delegation met with the 
employees of the US State Department, White House, NATO's 
experts and scientists from Research Centres. 
  "We tried to know the US strategic interests in our region 
and Washington's assessment of geopolitical situation in 
Transcaucasia", said Nadzhaf Nadzhafov. He mentioned that each 
specialist has its own views and that's why assesses the events 
in the Caucasus differently. In this connection, it is 
difficult to speak about the US common policy concerning the 
Caucasus. American specialists directly said that they are 
interested in development of Azerbaijan's oil-fields, said 
Nadzhafov. He also added that the US lack objective information 
about Azerbaijan. "One has to take measures to provide the US 
with regular information about Azerbaijan", said Nadzhaf 
Nadzhafov.
