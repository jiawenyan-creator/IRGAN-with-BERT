FT  22 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses early gains
on profit-taking
REPORTS that additional pension funds would be invested in the stock market
encouraged early trading, but share prices closed marginally lower on
afternoon profit-taking by investment trusts, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei average was finally 35.30 down at 17,645.44, after a morning high
of 17,787.56 and an afternoon low of 17,597.59. Tokkin, or specified money
trusts, were also seen placing sell orders.
Volume contracted to 250m shares from 320m. Declines led advances by 486 to
481, with 181 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks,
however, gained 2.0 at 1,345.77, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged
up 0.35 to 1,096.27.
Weaker futures prompted light arbitrage selling in the afternoon. Investors
offered little response to the government's budget draft for next fiscal
year to March 1994; this involved a 0.2 per cent rise in general account
spending to Y72,354.8bn, the smallest spending growth in six years.
Isuzu Motors, the most active issue of the day, rose Y27 to Y317 on reports
of a business tie-up with Honda. Investors focused on those reports rather
than news of Isuzu's withdrawal from passenger car products, announced at
the same time.
Hyogo Bank, the ailing regional bank, finished Y24 cheaper at Y586 on
profit-taking. Up last week on reports of aid from financial authorities,
Hyogo continued to rise in the morning but fell later on selling by dealers.
Some high-technology issues rose on hopes of an early US economic recovery,
Toshiba by Y5 to Y650 and Sony by Y50 to Y4,250. 'The worst of the news has
been discounted for electricals, and early buyers are coming in,' said Mr
Mike Jeremy, electronics analyst at BaringSecurities.
The Japan Securities Dealers Association suspended afternoon trading of Jax,
an import car dealer listed on the over-the-counter market, to allow
investors to confirm reports that Volkswagen, of Germany, had linked with
the company. Jax declined to comment. The company is currently the sole
distributor for Renault but is said to be terminating its agreement with the
French carmaker.
Yokohama Matsuzakaya, the department store which was rumoured to be targeted
by foreign speculators, dropped Y85 to Y490 on profit-taking.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 27.91 at 19,117.68 in volume of 31.9m
shares.
Roundup
THE MAIN features in the region yesterday were Hong Kong and Taiwan.
HONG KONG gained as overseas bargain hunters sparked a surge of afternoon
buying. The Hang Seng index ended at 5,242.48, up 49.82, as turnover dropped
to HKDollars 1.85bn from Friday's HKDollars 3.04bn.
Jardine Matheson Holdings closed HKDollars 1.75 off at HKDollars 41, after
an early low of HKDollars 40.50. The most active stock was HSBC Holdings,
which rose 50 cents to HKDollars 52.50.
TAIWAN closed 2.2 per cent weaker after the ruling Nationalist party's poor
performance in Saturday's parliamentary elections, but bargain hunting
lifted prices off early lows.
The weighted index, which was down some 130 points at mid-morning, ended
81.90 off at 3,576.09 in TDollars 13.5bn turnover.
Brokers said the strong gains in the elections by the main opposition, the
Democratic Progressive party, had sparked fears of conflict in parliament
and worsening divisions within the ruling party.
AUSTRALIA was lifted to a 16-week high by strong buying of leading stocks,
in the wake of major gains on overseas markets. The All Ordinaries index
finished 21.4 ahead at 1,537.0, but off a high of 1,541.6, in turnover of
ADollars 351.8m.
BOMBAY rose as state-owned mutual funds bought into an illiquid market. The
BSE index added 65.21 at 2,542.10. It opened strongly but turned back on
profit-taking.
