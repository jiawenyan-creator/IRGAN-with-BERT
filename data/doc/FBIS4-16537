  [Text] Andrey Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, left for 
former Yugoslavia late on 16 April. Before his departure, he 
gave an interview to INTERFAX. According to Kozyrev, if NATO 
had consulted Russia prior to carrying out air strikes against 
the Bosnian Serbs, another way could possibly have been found to 
warn the hotheads among the Bosnian Serbs to halt the shelling 
of Gorazde. At the same time, together with our partners we 
could, perhaps, have found a possibility to warn the other side, 
the Bosnian Muslims, who are clearly provoking the Serbs, the 
minister said.
