  [Text] Mexico City, 14 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the Mexican 
Attorney General's Office (PGR) announced the arrest of the 
country's main heroin drug trafficker who is also the chief of a 
drug-trafficking band in the northern State of Chihuahua. 
  In a communique, the PGR reported that Rosario Pina 
Carrillo, 
alias "El Callado," was arrested 11 June based on an arrest 
warrant issued against him for crimes against health and for 
charges of planting, growing, and harvesting marijuana. 
  According to the PGR, "El Callado," also known as "El 
Huarache de Oro," operated in Sinaloa and also directed a band 
of drug traffickers in Casas Grandes, Chihuahua State, which 
borders with the United States. 
  The group, headed by Pina Carrillo, consists of brothers 
Leonardo and Roberto Pina Valenzuela, Pina Chito, and the 
Morenos, against whom arrest warrants have been issued, and they 
are also believed to have links with the band "Borunda Ponce," 
the report indicated. 
  The "Borunda Ponce" band consists of drug traffickers from 
the northern State of Sinaloa who are considered dangerous. The 
criminal organization "Borunda Ponce" operates in Casas Grandes, 
Chihuahua. They finance the planting, transportation, and 
commercialization of narcotics, from which they make large 
profits, the source reported. 
  The PGR said Pina Carrillo's arrest will make it possible to 
arrest other drug traffickers in the near future and thus 
disbanding both groups, something that would be a hard blow for 
the Sinaloa and Chihuahua drug cartels.
