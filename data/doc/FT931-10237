FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Axa shares hit by fall in
profits and bond issue
AXA, one of France's largest insurance groups, yesterday saw its shares fall
FFr28 to FFr1,114 on the news of a fall in net profits for 1992 and of a
FFr3.65bn convertible bond issue to strengthen the capital position of
Equitable Life, its US associate.
Mr Claude Bebear, Axa chairman, said it needed to invest several hundred
million dollars in Equitable to enable the US company, in which Axa bought a
49 per cent stake in 1991, to meet the new US regulations on risk-based
capital ratios.
Equitable needs to raise its ratio from the present 85 per cent to the
required level of 100 per cent by 1995 when the new rules come into effect.
Mr Bebear stressed that the new ratio was the only reason for Axa's
investment in Equitable Life.
However, Axa suffered a sharp fall in profits last year with net
attributable profits slipping to between FFr1.5bn and FFr1.6bn from FFr2.4bn
in 1991. The group, like other French insurers, was hit by the intensely
competitive state of both the life and non-life markets in France.
Axa, which had previously announced a 34 per cent fall in first-half profits
to FFr979m, was affected by a steep reduction in the value of its
exceptional gains on sales of property and industrial investments and by a
poor second-half performance from Equitable Life.
In spite of yesterday's fall in Axa's share price analysts appeared
convinced that the investment in Equitable Life would be sufficient to solve
the ratio problems and that the US company was on course for recovery.
Analysts expect a moderate improvement in Axa's performance for 1993 in
spite of the difficulties of the French insurance market.
BNP Securities has predicted net profit of FFr2bn for this year with Paribas
forecasting FFr1.8bn.
