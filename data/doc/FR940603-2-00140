 

B. Hazardous Materials To Which Maryland Requirements Apply 


As summarized above, the Maryland certification requirements apply to operators of motor vehicles transporting
hazardous waste and cargo tank vehicles transporting oil when those vehicles are loaded or unloaded within the State
of Maryland. 
An oil is a hazardous material subject to the HMTA and HMR if it meets the criteria of any HMR hazard class. Most oils that
are designated as hazardous materials are designated because they meet criteria for flammability, 49 CFR 173.120(a),
or combustibility, 49 CFR 173.120(b). If an oil is not flammable or combustible, does not meet the criteria for any
other hazard class, and is not among a small number of individually specified hazardous materials, 49 CFR 172.101(b)(1),
it is not a designated hazardous material. Numerous oils, such as lubricating and vegetable oils, are not ordinarily
designated hazardous materials. 
Accordingly, the Maryland oil cargo tank operator certification requirement applies to the transport of both oils
that are hazardous materials and those that are not. Operator certification requirements for the transport of oils
that are not hazardous materials are not subject to preemption by the HMTA. This preemption determination pertains
to the oil cargo tank operator certification requirement only as it applies to the transport of oils that are hazardous
materials. 
In addition, the HMR do not apply to the highway transportation of oil by an intrastate carrier if that oil is not a hazardous
waste, hazardous substance, flammable cryogenic liquid or marine pollutant. 49 CFR 171.1(a)(3); but see 58 FR 36920
(July 9, 1993), correction at 58 FR 38111 (July 15, 1993)(notice of rulemaking proposing to extend the HMR to intrastate
highway carriage). Accordingly, this preemption determination does not apply to the transportation by intrastate
highway carriers of oil not in the categories enumerated in 49 CFR 171.1(a)(3). 
The Maryland statute under which the CHS vehicle operator certification requirement is enacted defines CHS broadly,
to include RCRA hazardous waste, low-level nuclear waste and any other substance determined by MDE to be injurious
to plant, animal or aquatic life. Env't Article 7201(b), Ann. Code Md. As noted above, however, the certification
requirement is applied only to operators of vehicles transporting RCRA hazardous waste. Thus, hereafter, the CHS
vehicle certification requirement will be referred to as the hazardous waste vehicle operator certification requirement.

RCRA hazardous waste, as designated pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6921 by the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), is a hazardous material under the HMR. 49 CFR 171.8 (``Hazardous material'') (as amended at 55 FR 52930,
52935 (Nov. 5, 1992)); see also 49 CFR 171.3(a) (``No person may offer for transportation or transport a hazardous
waste *** in interstate or intrastate commerce except in accordance with the requirements of [the
HMR].''). Both interstate and intrastate hazardous waste transporters are subject to the HMR. 49 CFR 171.1(a). 
In the preemption analysis that follows, the Maryland certification requirements are compared to HMTA requirements
under the ``dual compliance'' and ``obstacle'' tests of 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a). See Section II, below. For purposes
of the dual compliance test, the hazardous waste vehicle operator certification requirement is considered as written.
The obstacle test, however, looks at the requirement ``as applied or enforced.'' 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a)(2). Therefore,
under this test, the requirement is considered only as it is applied to the transportation of RCRA hazardous waste.



C. HMTA Training and Certification Requirements for Motor Vehicle Operators 


General training requirements for persons packaging, offering or transporting hazardous materials are found in
the HMR at 49 CFR 172.700-.704. These requirements apply to ``hazmat employees,'' which term includes, among others,
those who ``[o]perate[] a vehicle used to transport hazardous materials.'' 49 CFR 172.702(b), 171.8 (``Hazmat employee'').
Each ``hazmat employee'' must receive, at least every two years, three types of training: (1) Training to provide
general familiarity with the HMR and a general ability to recognize and identify hazardous materials consistent
with HMR standards; (2) training specific to the hazardous material functions the employee performs; and (3) training
in workplace safety and emergency response. 49 CFR 172.704(a). Required training is not further specified; instead,
the regulations contemplate that hazmat employees will be trained in a manner best suited to the hazardous materials
transportation functions they perform. See 57 FR 20944, 20949 (May 15, 1992)(preamble to final rule enacting 49 CFR
172.700.704). 
In addition, operators of motor vehicles transporting hazardous materials must be trained in accordance with modal-specific
requirements of 49 CFR 177.816. Training subjects include vehicle inspection and operation; requirements pertaining
to attendance, parking, smoking, routing and incident reporting; and loading and unloading. 49 CFR 177.816(a).
Cargo tank operators must receive specialized training in tank emergency control features, special vehicle handling
characteristics, tank loading and unloading, properties and hazards of materials transported, and tank retest
and inspection requirements. 49 CFR 177.816(b). Under section 177.816, operators must be trained in applicable
requirements of parts 383, 387 and 390 through 399 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR), 49 CFR
parts 350399. 
Part 383 specifies requirements for obtaining a Commercial Driver's License (CDL), including requirements for
the tank vehicle endorsement, 49 CFR 383.119, and the hazardous materials endorsement, 49 CFR 383.121. Section 177.816(c)
provides that the training requirements of sections 177.816(a) and (b) may be satisfied by compliance with the CDL
requirements for the tank vehicle or hazardous materials endorsement. Sections 390.3(e)(2) and 392.1 together
require operator training in all aspects of the FMCSR. They are incorporated into the HMR as well by 49 CFR 177.804,
as they apply to interstate operators of motor vehicles transporting hazardous materials. 
Both 49 CFR 172.704(d) and 49 CFR 177.816 require that training documentation be retained; 49 CFR 172.702(d) requires
that an employer test its employees. No provision of the HMR, however, requires that evidence of training be submitted
to, or that operators be tested or certified by, a governmental body. A vehicle operator may comply with 49 CFR 177.816
by passing an examination and obtaining the CDL with a tank vehicle or hazardous materials endorsement. 49 CFR 177.816(c)(1).
