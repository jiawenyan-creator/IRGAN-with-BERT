  [Text] Buenos Aires, May 16 (CNA) -- Uniglory Marine Corp., 
a subsidiary of Taiwan's Evergreen Group, recently launched 
container service between Taiwan and Argentina. 
  A Uniglory ship made its maiden call at the Buenos Aires 
port 
last week, thus opening another ship connection between Taiwan 
and Argentina. The Taipei-based Chien Hong opened its container 
service between Taiwan and Argentina through South Africa in 
1992. 
  Omar Leirado, spokesman for the Heinlein Maritime Agency, 
Uniglory's agency in Buenos Aires, said that eight full 
container ships have been assigned to ply the route between 
Taiwan and Argentina. "This will initially give us an average 
frequency of one vessel calling at Buenos Aires every 11 days," 
he said. 
  Two-way trade between Argentina and Taiwan totaled some 
US$300 million in 1993.
