 Final Rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is removing from its regulations provisions regarding emergency signaling
devices and unnecessary references to statutory and departmental authority. Provisions for placement of emergency
signaling devices are adequately covered in the National Fire Code (NFC) standards. Adherence to NFC standards,
the provision of 24-hour staff coverage, and the conditions of confinement in Bureau institutions obviate the need
for further regulation on emergency signaling devices. References to statutory and departmental authority for
victim and/or witness notification are being incorporated into the authority citation for the part and are therefore
removed from the regulations. These amendments are editorial in nature and represent no change in Bureau policy.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations on Emergency Signaling Devices_Inmate Housing Units and on Victim
and/or Witness Notification. A final rule on Emergency Signaling Devices was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 1, 1983 (48 FR 24625), and a final rule on Victim and/or Witness Notification was published April 30, 1984 (49
FR 18386) and was amended February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6178). 


All Bureau institutions conform to applicable standards of the National Fire Code, which include provision for the
placement of emergency signaling devices in all institution housing units. Bureau regulations in 28 CFR 551.140
had stipulated that such devices be accessible to inmates in locked dormitories which do not have 24-hour staff coverage
and in housing units with rooms or cells (both single and multiple occupancy) lacking 24-hour staff coverage. The
only Bureau institutions with dormitories or housing units which do not have 24-hour staff coverage are in Federal
Prison Camps. Staff coverage is provided in these units at night and at other times when inmates are permitted in their
quarters. Because of the lessened security needs in Federal Prison Camps, dormitories and housing units in these
institutions are not locked. Consequently, the provisions in 551.140 serve no practical purpose and are therefore
being removed.
