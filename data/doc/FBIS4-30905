  [Text] Prague May 31 (CTK) -- Russia will pay off $3.5 
billion in debt to the Czech Republic by 2003, Czech Deputy 
Finance Minister Vladimir Rudlovcak told reporters today. He 
said it was agreed last night in a meeting with visiting Russian 
First Deputy Finance Minister Andrey Vavilov. An agreement on 
the debt settlement is expected to be signed within three weeks 
after the Czech Government discussion, Rudlovcak said. 
  In agreement with the methods of the Paris Club of 
creditors, 
both sides agreed on the postponement of payments of the main 
part of the debt worth $1.8 billion until 1999 with regular 
half-year payments until 2003. The payment of the government 
credit at a value of $1.3 billion, the second major part of the 
debt, will begin in 1996, Rudlovcak said. 
  Money owed to Czech enterprises amounting to $330 million 
and 
another $32 million related to the 1991 trade will be paid off 
in a form of goods in the period of 1994 to 1995, Rudlovcak 
said. He said the Czech side was interested in paying these 
sums through oil and natural gas supplies, but Russia opposed to 
it. However, it pledged to send in goods worth $50 million in 
the "foreseeable future" to cover part of these amounts, 
Rudlovcak added. 
  If the $362 million were not paid off by goods until 1995 
the 
two sides agreed on annual up to $70 million payments in 1996 
and 1997, Rudlovcak said. 
  He did not rule out the possibility of capitalisation of 
part 
of the debt, but said that no specific agreement had as yet been 
concluded in this respect. The debt capitalisation would lead 
to more intensive contacts between Russian and Czech 
enterprises, which is desirable, Rudlovcak said.
