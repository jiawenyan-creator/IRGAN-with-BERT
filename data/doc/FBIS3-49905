  [Text] Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic of 
Srpska, has disclosed the new platform for negotiations with the 
Croatian and Muslim sides in Geneva, which withdraws the 
concessions given to Muslims earlier because they have rejected 
the proposal offered for solving the crisis. In the 
continuation of the peace process the republic of Srpska will 
maintain the following positions, which take into consideration 
the actual situation. 
  The republic of Srpska is a sovereign and independent state 
established on the basis of the universal right of a people to 
self-determination. It will retain the right to association and 
unification. The capital of the republic of Srpska is Serbian 
Sarajevo. The borders of the republic of Srpska correspond to 
the actual situation, which includes access to the sea, to which 
the republic of Srpska has a right on the basis of the Serbian 
Declaration of the St. Germaine Peace Treaty and other 
international documents. In the interest of compressing 
territory, the borders with the Muslims can be adjusted on the 
basis of a political agreement, which would take into account 
communications and other needs. The borders with the Croats 
will be defined within the framework of a solution for the 
entire Serbian-Croatian conflict. The republic of Srpska will 
participate in the peace process, but it will insist on equal 
treatment which means that the sanctions have to be lifted and 
the threats against the Serbs have to stop. Any violation of 
the republic of Srpska's integrity will be taken as an act of 
aggression and [the Serbian republic] will respond according to 
regulations of international war law. 
  These are excerpts from the platform adopted at yesterday's 
session of the republic of Srpska assembly in Bijeljina.
