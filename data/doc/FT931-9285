FT  15 FEB 93 / Observer: Purdah battles
Whatever happened to 'budget purdah' - the 2 1/2 month period between New
Year and the budget when Treasury ministers are not meant to comment in
public on possible tax changes or other economic and financial matters
relevant to the budget.
Her Majesty's Treasury insists that nothing has changed. Security is as
strict as ever in the run-up to next month's budget. However, judging by the
recent outpourings of more telegenic Treasury ministers, such as Michael
Portillo and Stephen Dorrell, there seem to be differring ideas on what
constitutes purdah.
The Sunday Telegraph, for example, wanted Michael Portillo to write about
his plans for reforming the welfare state yesterday. First he agreed, but
then the Treasury's purdah patrol got to hear of it and he changed his mind.
The recent surprise base rate cut might have been better handled if Treasury
ministers had not been hidden away in purdah.
One ominous sign is that the chancellor's annual Mansion House speech, where
he talks about monetary policy, has been brought forward from late October
to June 15. Surely this can't be an excuse for an even longer period of
ministerial silence in the run-up to the December budget?
