  [Text] Esteemed Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani, president of 
the Islamic State of Afghanistan, answered the questions of 
foreign journalists on the current situation in the country in a 
news conference held this afternoon. A BIA [BAKHTAR INFORMATION 
AGENCY] correspondent told us that the news conference was 
attended by correspondents of foreign news agencies. 
  At the beginning, Rabbani spoke about the social and 
political situation of the country and the peace-seeking policy 
of Afghanistan. The esteemed president said: The policy of 
Afghanistan is a peaceful policy. The state and the people of 
Afghanistan do not want fighting. Those whose interests are 
linked with fighting want fighting. We want peace to be 
restored very soon because no issue can be resolved by pressure 
and force. Rabbani also shed light on the peace-seeking 
measures of the Islamic state. 
  The president then answered the foreign journalists' 
questions. Answering a question, Rabbani said: We want a large 
gathering to be convened by the people in order that the future 
leadership of the country be elected, and in the current 
conditions the state cannot leave the scene vacant. Answering 
another question, our country's esteemed president said: The 
state makes many efforts for a permanent cease-fire. We do not 
want the fighting to continue, but unfortunately a large part of 
the causes of fighting emanate from abroad.
