ROBERT WAGNER, JILL ST. JOHN WED 
Actor Robert Wagner and actress Jill St. John were married Saturday at the 
actor's home, Wagner's publicist said. 
Wagner, 60, and St. John, 49, were married in a small private ceremony in the 
garden of the actor's home in Pacific Palisades, publicist Alan Nierob said. 
Nierob said Wagner, the former husband of the late Natalie Wood, and St. John, 
who have been together for eight years, were joined in the ceremony by the 
daughters of Wagner and Wood: Kate, 26, who served as maid of honor; Natasha, 
19, and Courtney, 16, both of whom, served as bridesmaids. 
J. Watson Webb Jr. served as Wagner's best man and Wagner's sister, Mrs. Albert 
Scott, was matron of honor, according to Nierob, who said Wagner's and St. 
John's mothers both attended the ceremony. 
The marriage is Wagner's fourth, including two marriages to Wood, who drowned 
Nov. 29, 1981. It was also the fourth marriage for St. John.
