FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: Kymmene sees deficit widen to
FM849m
KYMMENE, the Finnish pulp and paper group, made a FM849m (Dollars 183.37m)
loss after financial items for the first eight months of the year, compared
with a FM634m deficit for the same period of 1991.
Turnover also fell slightly to FM8.421bn from FM8.531bn while operating
profit was FM243m, down from FM335m. Mr Harri Piehl, chief executive, said
the group would make a greater loss in 1992 than expected, though smaller
than the FM1.299bn of last year.
The company expects to save FM500m in earnings through cost-cutting and
productivity improvement measures. It said last November's 12.3 per cent
devaluation of the markka had improved its overseas competitiveness, but the
flotation of the markka and turbulence on international money markets made
it hard to assess the outlook.
Mr Piehl said the group's future profits were 'critically dependent on the
market for printing and writing papers,' which account for around 70 per
cent of turnover.
