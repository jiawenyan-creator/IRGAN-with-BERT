26 YOUNG INMATES SUBDUED AFTER 20-MINUTE FIGHT 
Simmering racial tensions between Asian and Latino prisoners at a 
minimum-security California Youth Authority facility in the Antelope Valley 
boiled over into a full-scale battle Thursday night when more than 26 inmates 
fought for nearly 20 minutes before they were subdued by authorities. 
Supt. Steve Shaw said most of the Asian and Latino inmates at Camp Fenner, a 
minimum-security work camp in Llano, were involved in the fight, which was 
waged with mops, brooms and sticks. 
Shaw said four prisoners were treated at hospitals for injuries received in the 
incident. 
The disturbance, which broke out shortly before 9 p.m., stemmed from a racially 
motivated fight earlier in the day, he said. 
Camp Fenner houses 125 juvenile offenders who are between the ages of 18 and 
25.
