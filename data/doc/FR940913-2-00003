<DOCTITLE>Draft Environmental Impact Statement; Office Complex at Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Prince George's
County, MD</DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has prepared
a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for construction of a 350,000 square foot, low-rise office complex
plus associated parking on federal land within the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Prince George's County,
Maryland. The project provides for consolidation of USDA functions currently located in leased facilities in Maryland
and the District of Columbia, and in the USDA Headquarters South Building, which will be renovated. Since initiating
the EIS process with a public scoping meeting in January, 1994, the size of the proposed office complex has been decreased
by USDA from 700,000 s.f. to 350,000 s.f.

The Draft EIS considers environmental impacts from project implementation on each of three (3) possible government-owned
sites: Site A, 100

#

 acres north of the Capital Beltway, southeast of the Rhode Island Avenue/Sunnyside Avenue intersection; Site B,
120

#

 acres east of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, southeast of the Powdermill Road/Soil Conservation Service Road
intersection; and Site D, 94

#

 acres southeast of the Edmonston Road/Beaverdam Road intersection. A ``No Action'' alternative is also considered.
Potential environmental impacts include short-term construction-related impacts, and long-term changes in traffic,
socio-economic and physical conditions. The Draft EIS is available for inspection at the Beltsville, Greenbelt,
and College Park Public Libraries, and upon request from the USDA Headquarters at the address given below.

A Public Hearing on the Draft EIS will be held on October 27, 1994, at 7:00 p.m. in the auditorium of the Beltsville Agricultural
Research Center, Building 003, 10300 Baltimore Avenue, Beltsville, Maryland 20705. A short presentation by USDA
summarizing the Draft EIS will precede a period for public comments. Oral comments should be limited to ten (10) minutes
each. Agencies and the public are invited to provide written comments on the Draft EIS, in addition to, or in lieu of,
oral comments at the Public Hearing. All written comments must be mailed, no later than October 27, 1994 to: Mr. Michael
V. Sazonov, Contracting Office Technical Representative, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Office of Operations,
Washington Area Service Center, South Building, Room S313, 14th and Independence Avenue SW., Washington,
D.C. 20250; Telephone (202) 7202804.
