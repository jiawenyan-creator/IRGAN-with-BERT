FT  27 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: CBOT may offer link with
Cincinnati exchange
THE Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), the world's largest futures exchange, is
negotiating to link its new electronic trading terminals to an
over-the-counter stock trading network operated by the Cincinnati Stock
Exchange.
The deal would be a first for a US futures exchange, and demonstrates that
the CBOT is making aggressive plans to expand beyond its traditional futures
and options businesses.
The announcement was made at the launch of the CBOT's Project A, a local
electronic trading system that will trade during the CBOT's regular market
hours.
Initially, the exchange is offering futures on barge freight, two varieties
of zero coupon bonds, and an option on long bonds on Project A. However, Mr
William O'Connor, CBOT chairman, says the system will be used to list a
variety of non-traditional products, and provide access for CBOT members to
markets for cash government securities and stocks. The Cincinnati Exchange
does not have a trading floor, and operates entirely through a 'black box'
computer system. It is an affiliate of the CBOT's neighbour, the Chicago
Board Options Exchange. CBOE members own the majority of the seats on the
Cincinnati exchange.
