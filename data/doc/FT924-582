FT  23 DEC 92 / Hungary in sell-off bid
THE HUNGARIAN govern - ment intends to follow up on the success of its
latest two stock market privatisations with up to 20 more launches next
year, including Matav, the national telecoms utility, Mr Tamas Szabo,
privatisation minister announced yesterday.
The authorities plan to float 10-20 state companies, he said. Mr
The privatisation moves come as political reaction is growing against the
predominance of foreign investors, who have provided 70 per cent of
Hungary's Ft67bn (Pounds 532m) privatisation proceeds in the year so far.
The other prong of the conservative government's privatisation strategy is
therefore to allow the Hungarian public to buy on easy terms run-of-the-mill
companies that cannot be floated.
