FT  18 JAN 94 / Cambodia delegation for China
The Cambodian government has sent a 40-member delegation to Beijing for a
five-day visit intended to lay to rest 30 years of Chinese support for the
Khmer Rouge, writes Iain Simpson in Phnom Penh.
The delegation, led by the country's two prime ministers, is also expected
to discuss arms sales and other defence issues with its Chinese hosts.
Beijing was the largest source of both political and military support for
the Khmer Rouge during its struggle for control of Cambodia in the 1970s,
after it came to power in 1975 and during the 12-year civil war that
followed its overthrow in 1979.
Thousands of Chinese advisers were sent to Phnom Penh during the radical
faction's four-year reign of the country, when hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians lost their lives to murder, starvation and disease.
Now, the Chinese government wants to show its Cambodian guests and the rest
of the world that those days are over and that Beijing now fully supports
the elected government in Phnom Penh and not the Khmer Rouge guerrillas who
are still fighting to bring the government down.
