Fuels and Fuel Additives Registration Regulations 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule establishes new requirements for the 
registration of designated fuels and fuel additives (F/FAs) as 
authorized by sections 211(b)(2) and 211(e) of the Clean Air Act 
(CAA). The registration requirements are organized within a three-
tier structure. Tier 1 requires F/FA manufacturers to perform a 
literature search on the health and welfare effects of F/FA 
emissions, characterize the emissions, and provide qualitative 
exposure information. Tier 2 requires biological testing for the 
examination of subchronic systemic and organ toxicity, as well as 
the assessment of specific health effects endpoints. When 
necessary, Tier 3, which includes follow-up studies or other 
additional tests, may be required. The rule permits adequate 
existing test data to be submitted in lieu of conducting new 
duplicative tests. It also includes special provisions for small 
businesses and certain types of products, and a grouping system 
which permits manufacturers of similar F/FA products to share the 
costs of compliance.
