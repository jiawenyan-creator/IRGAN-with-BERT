SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
Police are looking for a 24-year-old man in connection with the stabbing death 
of another man in Logan Heights. 
When police arrived at the scene about 6:50 a.m. Sunday, they found Ernest 
Thomas Sharpe, 33, dead with a stab wound in his chest. 
The killing on 29th Street between Imperial Avenue and Commercial Street is 
believed to have been drug-related, said San Diego police spokesman Bill 
Robinson. 
He said police are looking for Jeff Gaulden of San Diego. 
Sharpe apparently arrived in the area with some friends and, after talking 
about drugs with a man, got into an argument with him. 
Another man then approached Sharpe with a knife, but, when Sharpe tried to run 
away, he stumbled and was stabbed, Homicide Lt. Dan Berglund said. A knife was 
found in a yard near the scene. 
Just after 1 a.m. Monday, a police SWAT team, along with eight other officers, 
sealed off an area in the 2100 block of Oceanview Boulevard because the suspect 
was thought to be holed up in a house there, Robinson said. The house turned 
out to be empty.
