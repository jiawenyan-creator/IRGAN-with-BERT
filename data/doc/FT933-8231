FT  17 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Argos
CBI surveys may suggest that most retailers are feeling more perky about
life, but conditions are barely good enough to raise a smile from the Argos
board. The company has seen trading conditions improve steadily through the
year, but management's eyes are relentlessly focused on the 25 per cent of
sales which fall in the five weeks up to Christmas. Large tax increases in
Mr Kenneth Clarke's November budget would depress consumer confidence in the
critical period - hence the company's nervousness yesterday.
Yet it would not do to get too gloomy. The advantages of last year's
catalogue changes and new sales formats will not drop away immediately.
There is unlikely to be a repeat of the jewellery price war of two years
ago, and the company continues to throw off cash despite the expansion of
its store chain.
In the longer term, Argos, in common with several other retailers, faces the
problem of what to do with its strong cash inflows and swelling cash pile.
After the Chesterman furniture fiasco, Argos will doubtless be cautious
about future diversification. Yet only a sizeable acquisition will absorb
much cash, and if no target is forthcoming, the company may consider
returning its excess equity. That might raise some cheer among shareholders
and support the shares, which otherwise are beginning to look somewhat
overstretched.
