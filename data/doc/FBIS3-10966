  [Text] The new Congress will be installed on 20 July. One 
significant development is that the country has returned to a 
two-party system. The results of yesterday's elections were 
very similar to those of 1991. In the Senate, the Liberal Party 
retained 59 percent of the seats, and the Conservative Party won 
28 percent. The supraparty system fared poorly, with the virtual 
disappearance of the AD-M-19 [19 April Movement Democratic 
Alliance] and the National Salvation Party. Christian movements 
received 5 percent of the seats, enhancing their importance in 
the Senate. The democratic left, in almost all its forms, is 
headed for extinction. As for the Chamber of Representatives, 
Liberals retained 55 percent of the seats, and Conservatives 
picked up the 7 percentage points lost by the AD/M-19. 
  In effect, nothing is new, and we can expect the usual from 
Congress as the degree of changes seems to have been minimal.
