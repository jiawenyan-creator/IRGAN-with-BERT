SHERATON, PAN AM SIGN PACT WITH SOVIETS TO BUILD 2 HOTELS 
ITT Sheraton Corp. and Pan American World Airways Inc. today signed an 
agreement with the Soviet Union to build two luxury hotels in the Soviet 
capital with the first Sheraton Moscow Hotel to be completed in 1992 for $75 
million. 
The hotels will be operated and owned by a joint venture formed by ITT 
Sheraton, with 40% of the investment; Pan Am with 10%, and two Soviet 
organizations with the other 50% of the investment -- Mossoviet, Moscow's City 
Council, and Aeroflot, the Soviet airline. 
"This is the first joint venture of this nature in the history of the relations 
between the United States and the Soviet Union," Soviet Ambassador Yuly V. 
Dubinin noted. "It is an outstanding example of how the East and the West can 
work together for their mutual benefit and progress."
