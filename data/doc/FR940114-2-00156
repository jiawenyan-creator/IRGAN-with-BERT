VA published a final regulation amending 38 CFR 4.16(a) in the

the poverty threshold for one person. VA noted that the weighted average poverty threshold in 1988 for one person (unrelated
individual) as established by the Bureau of the Census was $6,024 and stated we would publish subsequent poverty threshold
figures as notices in the 

Federal Register

.

person (unrelated individual) is $7,143.
