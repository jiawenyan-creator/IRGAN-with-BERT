FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Norsk Hydro profits cut by half
NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest listed company, yesterday disclosed that
nine-month net profits had been cut by half to NKr520m (Dollars 93.2m) from
NKr1.041bn last year due to weak conditions in main markets and foreign
currency losses.
Hydro said it would intensify cost-cutting measures and improve efficiency.
The group plunged into a third-quarter net loss of NKr268m from a NKr39m
profit last year, after suffering financial losses of NKr403m compared with
financial income of NKr174m last year.
Hydro's weak result was far worse than analysts' forecasts. The group's
performance was due to third-quarter losses by the agriculture division and
adverse currency swings.
In the nine-month period, group revenue fell by NKr1.153bn to NKr44.471bn
and by NKr590m to NKr13.123bn in the third quarter. Mr Egil Myklebust, Norsk
Hydro's president, blamed the result on the international recession,
difficult market conditions for fertilisers and negative effects from
European currency movements.
'The international recession seems to drag on longer than was generally
expected at the beginning of the year,' Mr Myklebust said. This has led to
low prices for light metals, petrochemical products and fertilisers. Group
nine-month operating income fell to NKr2.183bn from NKr3.002bn.
The only bright spot in the group was the oil and gas division, which saw
nine-month operating profit fall slightly by NKr12m to NKr1.965bn as revenue
rose by NKr805m to NKr9.947bn.
Production of oil and gas rose to 2.3m tonnes of oil equivalent from 1.6m
last year. Although crude oil prices were slightly higher, this was offset
by a weaker dollar. The agriculture division fell into a nine-month
operating loss of NKr123m from a NKr433m profit last year.
Hydro said agriculture suffered from weaker margins, a fall in consumption
and strong price competition. The light metals division saw nine-month
revenue slashed by NKr1.146bn to NKr11.956bn as operating profit fell to
NKr276m from NKr460m.
Aluminium and magnesium improved in spite of lower prices and Hydro said
costs had been cut.
The petrochemicals division lifted nine-month operating revenue to
NKr3.157bn from NKr3.098bn but operating profits were cut to NKr291m from
NKr377m.
Hydro said that low third-quarter prices were offset by a higher sales
volume.
