FT  17 NOV 92 / Sell-off possible for Scots water
THE GOVERNMENT will today set out its options for bringing private-sector
capital into the Scottish water and sewerage industry. Although these are
likely to include privatisation by means of a stock market flotation, other
possibilities are to be advanced.
Water and sewerage services in Scotland, which were not privatised when the
English water companies were sold in 1989, are run by the nine regional and
three island councils.
Strong opposition to privatisation has arisen following the disclosure in
July by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, that he was looking at ways 'in
which the private sector might contribute enterprise and investment' to
Scottish water.
An opinion poll showed only 4 per cent of Scots in favour of privatisation.
Only 9 per cent of the Conservatives who were asked supported it.
Mr Lang, who will be addressing the House of Commons today, will present a
consultation paper that follows a study by the merchant bankers Quayle
Munro.
He is expected to challenge the opposition parties to say how they would
meet the need to restructure Scottish water and sewerage, and find the
finance to improve it.
The government says a review is needed because most regional councils will
disappear when local government is reorganised in 1996, while compliance
with EC water and sewerage directives could cost Pounds 2.5bn in the next 10
to 15 years.
Improving existing installations would cost a further Pounds 2.5bn. The
Treasury is reluctant either to pay for this or to sanction new borrowing.
Apart from creating water companies and then floating them off, private
capital could be brought in by granting concessions to run and invest in
water services.
