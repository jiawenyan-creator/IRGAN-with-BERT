FT  02 NOV 94 / Clashes worsen across Bosnia
The war in Bosnia was in danger of escalating yesterday amid reports that
rebel Serb forces in Croatia have mobilised to aid their ethnic allies
across the frontier and Bosnian Croats have joined a Moslem offensive in the
north-west.
Some 2,000 Serb fighters from Krajina, the self-styled Serb state in
Croatia, are ready to cross into neighbouring Bosnia, say local Serb
leaders. Bosnian government troops last week launched an offensive from
Bihac, the north-western Moslem enclave which is also a UN-designated safe
area, gaining some 250 sq km of territory from their Serb foes.
The threat of Serb retaliation yesterday increased with reports that Bosnian
Croats have joined Moslem troops in the region. 'They have taken up Serb
positions on the west bank of the Una river, south of Bihac town,' said Mr
Paul Risley, UN spokesman in Zagreb. HVO troops, Bosnian Croat forces, had
even engaged Krajina fighters in Croatia itself, along the western flank of
the Bihac pocket, said Mr Risley. The HVO had also moved troops to the
confrontation line near Kupres, in central Bosnia, where Moslem forces had
also gained ground against the Serbs. The stepped-up involvement of the HVO
will make it more difficult for international mediators who have been trying
to broker a deal between Zagreb and Krajina Serbs and may also put Serbia's
President Slobodan Milosevic under pressure to intervene.
