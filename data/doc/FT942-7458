FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Strong farm sector boosts Deere
Deere and Company, the Moline, Illinois-based maker of farm and industrial
equipment, said strength in the North American farm sector boosted
second-quarter net income to Dollars 189.3m, or Dollars 2.20 a share.
In last year's second quarter the group recorded income of Dollars 101m, or
Dollars 1.30 a share.
Deere's other equipment operations, which include ground care and lawn
machines and construction equipment, also improved with the generally
strengthening North American economy. Its worldwide sales for the quarter
jumped 17 per cent, to Dollars 2.46bn, from Dollars 2.10bn a year ago.
Although analysts had expected strong second-quarter results, Deere's share
price rose Dollars  1/2 , after the results were released, but closed down
Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 72 5/8 in New York.
Mr Hans Becherer, chairman, said that in response to strong retail demand,
Deere has increased its North American production schedules. '1994 worldwide
production tonnage is now anticipated to be 16 per cent higher than 1993
output, up from our prior estimate of 13 per cent,' he said.
However, the company warned that production in the second half would drop
below first-half levels, reflecting normal holiday shutdowns and re-tooling
for a new tractor line.
'North American retail sales activity during the first two quarters of 1994
provides a sound base for operations during the remainder of the year,' Mr
Becherer said.
'For 1994, the US Department of Agriculture has projected substantial
increases in planted acreages of corn and soyabeans, and is forecasting that
farm net cash income will be at one of the highest levels in history.'
He said that while Europe's long-term downward trend in sales of
agricultural equipment is likely to continue, Deere expects its 1994
European sales to be about equal to 1993.
