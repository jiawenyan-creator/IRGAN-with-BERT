KADAFI HELD 3 FREED HOSTAGES, PAPER SAYS 
Three European hostages freed this week in Beirut were captured by Col. Moammar 
Kadafi's government and held in Libya, not Lebanon, the Paris daily Le Figaro 
said. 
The French government said it could not confirm or deny the report. The 
newspaper cited unnamed sources in Paris, Brussels and Beirut as saying the 
government of Algeria -- and not Kadafi -- served as the principal mediator in 
negotiations to free the hostages, Frenchwoman Jacqueline Valente, 32, Belgian 
Fernand Houtekins, 42, and their daughter, Sophie, 2. France's Socialist 
government has come under international criticism for commending Kadafi for his 
role in freeing the captives.
