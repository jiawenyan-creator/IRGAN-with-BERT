<DOCTITLE>Northern Illinois Gas Co.; Notice of Petition For Rate Approval</DOCTITLE>



August 19, 1994.



Take notice that on August 11, 1994, Northern Illinois Gas Company (NI-Gas) filed pursuant to 284.123(b)(2)
of the Commission's regulations, a petition for rate approval requesting that the Commission approve a fair and equitable
monthly deliverability charge of $0.9500 per MMBtu and a monthly capacity charge of $0,0209 per MMBtu, plus actual
fuel used, for firm storage services performed under section 311(a)(2) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA).

NI-Gas states that it is an intrastate gas distribution public utility subject to the jurisdiction of the Illinois
Commerce Commission under the Illinois Public Utilities Act and that it was issued a blanket certificate under 284.224
in Docket No. CP92481000. NI-Gas proposes an effective date of August 11, 1994.

Pursuant to 284.123(b)(2)(ii), if the Commission does not act within 150 days of the filing date, the rate will
be deemed to be fair and equitable and not in excess of an amount which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge
for similar transportation service. The Commission may, prior to the expiration of the 150-day period, extend the
time for action or institute a proceeding to afford parties an opportunity for written comments and for the oral presentation
of views, data, and arguments.

Any person desiring to participate in this rate proceeding must file a motion to intervene in accordance with 385.211
and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedures. All motions must be filed with the Secretary of the
Commission on or before September 6, 1994. The petition for rate approval is on file with the Commission and is available
for public inspection.
