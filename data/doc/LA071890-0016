VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS; 
TEACHER WITHDRAWS FROM COUNCIL RACE 
A Thousand Oaks school teacher who announced several weeks ago that she was 
seeking a City Council seat in the November election has unexpectedly withdrawn 
from the race. 
In a written statement, Colleen Briner-Schmidt said she must postpone her plans 
because of "unexpected personal health reasons." 
She did not elaborate. 
Briner-Schmidt, who was backed by former city Mayor Frances Prince, had billed 
herself as a slow-growth, environmental candidate. 
Meanwhile, four people -- including Mayor Alex Fiore and Councilman Larry 
Horner -- have taken out papers to run for reelection in the fall, according to 
the city clerk's office. Thousand Oaks Planning Commissioner Judith Lazar and 
resident Michael Markey, a detective for the Compton Police Department, also 
said they plan to join the race for council. 
In the November election, three council seats are open, and candidates have 
until Aug. 15 to file their candidacies with the city clerk. Councilman Tony 
Lamb has announced that he will not seek reelection. TINA DAUNT
