  [Text] Washington January 9 TASS -- President Clinton left 
for Europe late on Saturday [8 January] for an eight-day 
mission. He is to attend a NATO summit, then fly on to Prague, 
Moscow, Minsk, and to Geneva for a January 16 meeting with 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad before flying home. 
  According to top officials of the U.S. Administration, the 
President's European tour pursues three goals. The first goal 
is to bring the U.S. "partnership for peace" concept up for U.S. 
NATO allies' endorsement. The concept envisions the 
establishment of the bloc's closer military cooperation with the 
former socialist countries of Europe. 
  The second goal is to show U.S. support for democratic 
processes in former communist states, and the third one is to 
reduce the spread of nuclear weapons and work for a greater 
Europe that is more economically vibrant.
