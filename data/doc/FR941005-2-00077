<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On August 26, 1994, the President signed legislation into law mandating that a fee of $45,000 must be paid by each person
acquiring voting securities or assets who is required to file a premerger notification by the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The newly enacted law amends Section
605 of Title VI of Pub. L. 101162, which mandated the collection of a $25,000 filing fee.


The new provision increasing the filing fee to $45,000 became effective upon the President's signature, late Friday,
August 26, 1994. The Commission is collecting the new fee for filings made on or after Monday, August 29. The Commission
has issued this Notice in order to advise the public about the increase in the filing fee.

<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE: 

The increased filing fee is due from acquiring persons submitting Premerger Notification and Report Forms on or after

The newly passed law (H.R. 4603, Pub. L. 103317) amends Section 605 of Title VI of Public Law 101162 (103
Stat. 1031), which originally mandated the collection of a filing fee beginning November 28, 1989, by striking ``$25,000''
and inserting in lieu thereof ``$45,000.''

</FOOTNAME>
Many other provisions of the legislation, relating to current appropriations for FY 95, are effective October 1,
1994. Although the fee increase provision is contained in the FY 95 current appropriations legislation, the increase
itself is not a current appropriation for FY 95, nor is it made dependent upon the FY 95 appropriation. Rather, the fee
increase is permanent legislation amending a provision of law that has been in effect since 1989. The appropriations
act contains no provision specifying an effective date for the fee increase provision, and it was therefore effective
upon enactment.
