STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH SET FOR JAN. 31 
President Bush will deliver his State of the Union address on Jan. 31 before a 
joint session of Congress, officials announced Thursday. 
The address, which will follow by two days the submission of his proposed 
budget for the fiscal year, will be Bush's first formal State of the Union 
speech, although he spoke before both houses shortly after his inauguration 
last year. 
Bush had planned to submit his proposed budget for fiscal 1991 on Jan. 22. But 
earlier this week Budget Director Richard G. Darman was forced to seek a 
seven-day delay because preparation of the fiscal plan was behind schedule.
