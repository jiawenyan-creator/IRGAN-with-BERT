FT  21 JUL 92 / Part-time workers 'more efficient'
STAFF working part-time, with flexible hours or in job shares perform better
than their full-time counterparts, according to a study commissioned by a
group of the UK's largest employers.
The research into 'family-friendly' policies found that staff working
non-standard hours were considered by their employers to be 'more efficient,
enthusiastic and committed' than full-timers.
The report concludes that 'family-friendly' working could more aptly be
called 'employer-friendly'. Employers invariably took the initiative when it
came to introducing policies such as job-sharing and term-time working.
Dependence on overtime was cut and absenteeism reduced.
High-street banks, building societies and other large employers including
IBM, Shell and the Post Office paid for the research by Sussex University's
Institute of Manpower Studies.
In spite of advantages to companies, detailed case studies of nine
organisations across the private and public sectors found some managerial
resistance to non-standard working. Managers feared that they would need to
spend more time on supervision.
