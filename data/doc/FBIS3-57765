  [Text] Austria's membership in the European Union (EU), 
Vienna's commitment on human rights issues, and attempts at 
defusing the crisis in the Balkans are the priorities of 
Austrian foreign policy at the turn of 1993/94, Foreign Minister 
Mock said. 
  "Full membership in the European Union is an absolute 
priority of Vienna's foreign policy at the moment," Mock said. 
Austria wants to share the responsibility for maintaining 
security in the European Union "in a very restless Europe" as an 
equal member. 
  Austria's commitment to human rights became apparent during 
three major events in 1993. Vienna was the venue of the first 
Christian-Islamic Conference, the United Nations Human Rights 
Conference, and the first summit of the Council of Europe heads 
of state and governments. In spite of different views, the 
Human Rights Conference contributed to "strengthening the 
controls in enforcing human rights," Mock said.
