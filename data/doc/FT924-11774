FT  23 OCT 92 / Maastricht bidding opens in Denmark
DENMARK'S minority government was faced with a fait accompli yesterday when
three opposition parties, with a majority in parliament, agreed on terms
which the country should seek from its EC partners regarding the Maastricht
treaty. Danes rejected the treaty in a June referendum.
Mr Poul Schluter, prime minister, last night welcomed the proposals - agreed
by the centrist Radical Liberals, Social Democrats and the left-wing,
anti-Maastricht Socialist People's Party - said he hoped it would pave the
way for a negotiating position backed by all parliamentary parties. Mr Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister, said a 'national compromise' should be
possible to achieve.
If special arrangements are agreed with the rest of the EC, the Danes will
submit the Maastricht treaty to a second referendum next year.
The proposals follow closely the terms outlined in a resolution by the
Social Democratic party congress in September. Denmark must be allowed to
stand aside from a common European defence, and from the introduction of a
common currency and the third stage of economic and monetary union.
It wants to continue to participate in the exchange rate mechanism, but must
maintain national control over economic and monetary policy. It also wants
to avoid any obligation to co-operate on immigration and internal security
on a supra-national basis.
