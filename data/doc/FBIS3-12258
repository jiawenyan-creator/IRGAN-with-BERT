  [Text] It seems that the PLO leadership wants now to start 
off again from the Hebron mosque massacre to strongly raise the 
question of settlers and settlements in the occupied territories 
once and for all. 
  Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, PLO Executive Committee member, today 
urged the Israeli Government to disarm the gangs of settlers. 
At a news conference in Tunis, 'Abd-Rabbuh said the presence of 
the settlers contradicts the course of peace as a whole. He 
added: 
  [Begin 'Abd-Rabbuh recording] The first step is to disarm 
those gangs. Without this, there will be no guarantee of making 
any achievement on the road of peace. Today's crime shows that 
the settlers in the occupied territories represent a time bomb 
that could explode at any moment and threaten the peace process 
and thwart any steps for peace. This makes it necessary to 
discuss the entire question of the presence of the settlers. It 
is impossible to reconcile gangs of killers and peace. [end 
recording] 
  'Abd-Rabbuh, who cast doubt on the Israeli version of the 
incident as a whole and deemed it a sort of connivance with the 
criminals, said the operation was carried out by a group made up 
of 20 to 30 settlers. He accused several senior Israeli Army 
officers of collusion to facilitate the killing of Palestinians. 
  The Palestinian official said the Palestinian leadership's 
decision regarding the continuation of the peace process as a 
whole is linked to several factors. 
  [Begin 'Abd-Rabbuh recording] We are waiting for specific 
measures from the Security Council to ensure international 
protection of Palestinian citizens. Second, we will wait for a 
resolution by the Security Council asserting that the presence 
of settlers and settlements is illegal and that the settlements 
should be removed. Third, the Israeli Government should take 
measures, the minimum of which, and the first step, is to disarm 
the gangs of settlers. In light of these factors, we will spell 
out our position in the coming phase. [end recording] 
  The PLO is still engaged in a flurry of activity to ensure a 
successful course of action by the Security Council.
