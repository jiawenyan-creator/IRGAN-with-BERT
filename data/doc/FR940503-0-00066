Annual DAS allocations. 

Vessels fishing under the Individual DAS program will receive and be subject to annual allocations of DAS based on
a fishing year as specified in the following table. These allocations are determined by reducing the vessel's Individual
DAS as calculated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section by 10 percent each fishing year, including the first year,
for the first 5 fishing years of the effort reduction program. Each fishing year shall begin on May 1 and extend 12 months
through April 30 of the following year.

(iv) All vessels fishing under the Individual DAS program must declare out of the multispecies finfish fishery for
at least one 20-day period between May 1 and May 31, or between March 1 and April 30, of each fishing year using the notification
requirements specified under 651.29(a). If a vessel owner has not declared, or taken, the period of time required
between May 1 and May 31 or between March 1 and April 10, of each fishing year on or before April 11 of each such year, the
vessel is subject to the possession limit specified under 651.27(a) during the period April 11 through April
30, inclusive.

Status of vessels pending appeal of DAS allocations. 

All vessels, while appealing their Individual-DAS allocation, may fish under the Fleet-DAS program and are subject
to all requirements applicable to the Fleet-DAS program unless otherwise exempted, until the Regional Director
has made a final determination on the appeal. Any DAS spent fishing for multispecies finfish shall be counted against
the Individual-DAS allocation that the vessel may ultimately receive. If before this appeal is decided, a vessel
exceeds the number of days it is finally allocated after appeal, the excess days will be subtracted from the vessel's
allocation of days in fishing year 1995.
