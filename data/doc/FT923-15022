FT  04 JUL 92 / Letter: Climate for house market recovery
Sir, The increase in the savings ratio to 11.5 per cent for the first
quarter is not perhaps as depressing as at first sight it might appear
('Boost to savings ratio, July 1).
Many home owners are now making substantial reductions in their mortgages by
failing to reduce monthly payments in line with falling interest rates. This
voluntary early repayment of principal in the building society sector may
now be running at approaching Pounds 2bn a year, in the order of 1 per cent
of building society mortgages and 0.5 per cent of personal disposable
income. And the amount increases with each cut in mortgage interest rates.
Since the dead weight of debt is a major cause of low turnover and falling
house prices, reductions in indebtedness are helping to create the
conditions for recovery in the housing market.
