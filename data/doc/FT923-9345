FT  06 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Car giants target Pakistan market
PAKISTAN'S tiny car market will be supplied with local production from as
many as four of Japan's nine motor groups, following Honda's decision to
begin manufacturing there.
Honda has had a motorcycle joint venture in the country since 1964. It is to
open the car plant in conjunction with the Atlas Group, its existing local
partner. They will together put in PRs400m (Pounds 9.3m), and the Japanese
company will have 51 per cent control.
Production of the Civic model at the facility near Lahore is intended to
reach 6,000 units a year.
Honda said its decision had been motivated by deregulation moves undertaken
by the government of Mr Nawaz Sharif, and expects the Pakistani car market
to grow steadily from current annual sales of 32,000.
Suzuki has a long-established car manufacturing presence in the country
while Toyota has a quarter share in a venture which will begin production of
20,000 Corollas a year from next spring. The local Bibojee group said in
Islamabad yesterday it was near to completing talks on the supply of Sunny
cars in knockdown kit form from Nissan, whose trucks it assembles.
