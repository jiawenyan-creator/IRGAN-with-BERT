 

The IEPA used the modelled VMT and speed data along with other area-specific data, such as the areas' representative
vehicle type distribution based on vehicle registration data, and default data and USEPA's MOBILE5a model to estimate
the on-road mobile source emissions. These emission estimates were adjusted to account for the impacts of vehicle
Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) and the average minimum and maximum daily temperatures on the ten highest ozone
days in each ozone nonattainment area. All input data used in the MOBILE5a modeling were described and documented
in the emission inventory submittals. 

Off-road mobile source emissions for railroad locomotives were based on the annual amount of fuel oil used by locomotives
in the ozone nonattainment areas and AP42 emission factors. County fuel oil usage rates were calculated by
apportioning State total fuel oil usage based county track mileage. To calculate daily emission rates, locomotive
usage was assumed to be uniform throughout the year and occurring over 61/2 days per week. VOC emissions were multiplied
by 0.98 to remove the emissions of methane. 

Off-road mobile source emissions for aircraft were based on landing/takeoff rates for O'Hare and Midway Airports
in the Chicago area accounting for the number and types of engines for each type of plane. Emissions by engine type were
obtained from current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reports. Emissions for all other airports were determined
considering annual operations (a landing or a takeoff) for each airport (landing/takeoff rates are assumed to equal
one-half the number of annual operations). For these airports, annual emissions were determined using the derived
landing/takeoff rates and default emission factors obtained from FAA reports. All aircraft emissions, calculated
on an annual basis, were converted to daily emissions assuming uniform operations throughout the year and throughout
the week. 

Off-road mobile source emissions for commercial vessels were determined by considering distillate and residual
fuel oil sales data and vessel movement data combined with AP42 emission factors. Emissions were apportioned
to counties by considering the county mileage of navigable waterways and tonnage of shipments. 

Off-road mobile source emissions for all other off-road mobile source categories were determined as part of an USEPA
off-road emission study. This 1991 study directly supplied emissions for the Chicago and St. Louis/Metro-East St.
Louis ozone nonattainment areas. Off-road mobile source emissions for Jersey County were derived from the 1991 USEPA
study by proportioning the study derived emissions for the St. Louis area to Jersey County on the basis of population
ratios and other source activity levels. 

Biogenic emissions for all three areas were determined using USEPA's PCBEIS biogenic emissions calculation
model. Information on land use, an input to the model, was obtained from several sources. Agricultural data for 1990
was obtained from the 1991 

Illinois Agricultural Statistics

. Information on the amount of land covered by forests was found in 

Forest Resources in Illinois: An Atlas and Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Trends.

 The area of water for each county was obtained from the 

1987 Inventory of Illinois Surface Water Resources.

 Other land use data were taken from the database supplied with the PCBEIS model. Meteorological data used with
PCBEIS were determined by following USEPA guidance on the use of PCBEIS and considering the ten days
(1988 through 1990) with the highest peak hourly ozone concentrations in each ozone nonattainment area. The representative
day (from a meteorological standpoint) was selected as the day with the fourth highest daily maximum ozone concentration
for each ozone nonattainment area. All data considered in the modeling of biogenic emissions were documented in the
emission inventory submittals and included in associated computer-based data files. 

The emissions in units of tons/day for an average summer weekday are summarized for each ozone nonattainment area
