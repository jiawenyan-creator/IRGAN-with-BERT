FT  25 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn EMI weakens
Shares in Thorn EMI tumbled 28 to 1068p as it reported full-year profits of
Pounds 326.5m against market forecasts of between Pounds 330m and Pounds
340m. Leisure analysts were also perturbed by growth prospects in the music
division and also in the dividend policy. Forecasts were reined in by around
10 per cent to the Pounds 400m-mark for 1995, with several brokers also
downgrading their stance on the stock.
Mr Geoff Collyer at NatWest Markets, who retained his long-term positive
position, said that the stock was also suffering from profit-taking after
its good run this year, fuelled in part by the publicity over multimedia.
The two Scottish generators showed the rest of the electricity/generator
sector a clean pair of heels as ther market picked up hints that the
National Grid is to allow Scottish Hydro and Scottish Power to export
electricity to England and Wales on highly favourable termms.
Mr Douglas Falconer, a utilities specialist at Yamaichi, the Japanese-owned
stockbroker, said the news was a strong bull point for the Scottish stocks
which were among his best buys in the sector. Scottish Hydro rose 11 to 366p
and Scottish Power 12 to 379p.
Water shares, meanwhile, extended their recent strong performance,
reflecting persistent hints around the market that the preliminary 'K
factors' indicated to the companies by OfWat, the industry regulator last
Friday, may have been better than the companies expected. Analysts warned,
however, that the negotiating process over the K factors will be hard fought
and not revealed until late July.
The second line water stocks attracted much of the buying interest with
Yorkshire, the sector's best performer on Monday, jumping 13 more to 526p.
Welsh added 18 at 629p, Wessex 14 at 634p and Northumbrian the same to 573p.
Severn Trent was the FT-SE 100's best individual performer, the shares
racing up 11 to 518p. North West Water, reporting this morning and expected
to announce an eight per cent increase in the dividend total, put on 10 to
520p.
Services and marketing group Inchcape tumbled after the chairman warned that
first half profits for the current year would be down on the same period a
year earlier.
The company blamed effects of a strong yen and the downturn in European car
markets, along with other factors, for the decline.
The shares extended an earlier decline and were down 26 at the day's worst
before steadying to finish 21 down at 499p, a six-month low for the stock.
Dealers saw some consolation in the chairman's optimism over second half
trading, which he said should enable maintainance of year-on-year profit
growth.
However My Nyran Scott-Malden at BZW said the decline in the share price was
'overdone given that this is what we expected for the first half'.
Granada was once again undermined by persistent talk suggesting problems
over the merger with LWT. The shares retreated 9 to 508p. Ladbroke suffered
for a second session following its bearish agm statement on Monday. The
shares slid 7 to 175 1/2 p. Forte, on the other hand, was the one bright
light in a maligned leisure sector, adding 4 to 236p on turnover of 2.3m,
following a positive agm the same day. Results from Fairline Boats helped
the shares jump 40 to 435p.

to 109p. Burton Group was said to be one beneficiary of switching out of
M&amp;S, the shares edging up three-quarters to 59p. Great Universal Stores held
up, slipping just a penny to 613p, on renewed hopes of an imminent share
buy-back.
