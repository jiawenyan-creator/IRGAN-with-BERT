  [Text] Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams al-Din, chairman of the 
Higher Islamic Shiite Council, has strongly condemned the 
Israeli act of piracy against the Qasr Naba village in al-Biqa' 
and the abduction of al-Haj Mustafa al-Dirani. He said this act 
reflects the true face of Zionist terrorism. 
  Shaykh Shams al-Din said: Israel committed this unjustified 
aggression at a time when Lebanon is regaining its stability and 
rebuilding its institutions. He stressed that the Israeli act 
represents a blatant violation of Lebanon's sovereignty and 
territorial integrity as well as all international norms and 
laws. This step, Shaykh Shams al-Din said, exposes Israel's 
false claims during the negotiations and its schemes against 
Lebanon and its independence. 
  In his statement, Shaykh Shams al-Din said: We urge the 
United Nations, the Security Council, and the human rights 
organizations to act promptly to end such bestial attacks and 
insure the release of al-Haj al-Dirani.
