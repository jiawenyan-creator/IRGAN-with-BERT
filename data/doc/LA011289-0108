WRITER SADLER OBJECT OF FAMILY'S SEARCH 
Singer-author Barry Sadler, who wrote the No. 1 hit "Ballad of the Green 
Berets," left a hospital where he was being treated for brain damage and is 
believed to be staying with friends, a lawyer said Wednesday. 
Sadler's wife, Lavona Ruth Sadler, and mother claim he is incompetent and 
should be place under guardianship. His 24-year-old son on Tuesday was named 
temporary guardian. 
Sadler, 48, was shot in the head during a robbery attempt at his home in 
Guatemala City in September and lost 30% of his brain, said Hal Hardin, an 
attorney for Sadler's wife. 
"Sometimes he's lucid, sometimes he's not. Sometimes he's conversant, sometimes 
he's no," Hardin said, adding that Sadler is partially paralyzed. 
Sadler was discharged Sunday night from a Veterans Administration Hospital in 
Cleveland and was reported missing by his family.
