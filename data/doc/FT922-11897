FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Walker Greenbank falls to Pounds 5.4m
WALKER GREENBANK, the wallcoverings and fabrics group, produced a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 5.43m in the year to January 31, compared with Pounds 8.03m
previously.
Although the 1990 disposal programme and recession caused a decline in
turnover to Pounds 56.8m (Pounds 75.3m), sales in the core wallcoverings
business remained almost static at Pounds 46.8m (Pounds 47m) while its
operating profit rose 9 per cent to Pounds 6.8m. Brymor, acquired in
February 1991, contributed Pounds 3m turnover and Pounds 1.87m operating
profit.
Pre-tax profit was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 212,000,
comprising reorganisation and closure costs of Pounds 1.43m, less Pounds
1.16m profit on sale of properties and trade investments of Pounds 53,000.
There was still a surplus property portfolio, which would be sold as the
market reovered.
Earnings per share were 4.14p (5.63p). The proposed final dividend is held
at 1.9p for a same-again total of 3.1p.
