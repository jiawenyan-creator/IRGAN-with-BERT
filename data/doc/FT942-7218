FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Donelon Tyson accounts delayed
Shares in Donelon Tyson fell 4p to 15p yesterday as the Cheshire-based
building and civil engineering company announced that its annual accounts
would be delayed and that the dividend was likely to be passed.
The directors said that their expectations of the group's results for the
year ended December 31 1993 were based on an assessment of the value of work
in progress which reflected the recognition of certain contractual claims.
Because of delays in agreeing some of those claims they could not now be
included in the 1993 results, they said.
The value of the unresolved claims is Pounds 3.5m.
