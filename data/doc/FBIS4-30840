  [Excerpt] While the military observers of the United 
Nations are trying to keep their promise given in the Sarajevo 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] headquarters that they will 
convince the chetnik forces not to fire (?133) mm guns and the 
M-46 and M-48, which are popularly known in the aggressor army 
as chetnik nightingales, from the village of (?Gaj) inside the 
20 km exclusion zone, the chetniks from (?Hadzici) on the other 
side have been attacking at irregular time intervals the lines 
of the fighters of the Army of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on the southern sector of the Hadzici front 
with 120mm and 80mm mortars all day today. 
  As we have learned from the command of the 9th Hill Brigade, 
19 mortar shells landed on the positions of our fighters this 
afternoon alone. They were fired from Zunovaca, which is also 
inside the 20 km exclusion zone. The village of Loste was not 
spared shelling either. It was hit by five shells. [passage
