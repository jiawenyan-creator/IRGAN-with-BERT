FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Jyske Bank slips into the red at
midway
Jyske Bank, the Jutland-based commercial bank, slipped into loss of DKr50m
(Dollars 8.09m) in the first half-year. This compares with a profit of
DKr378m in the same period last year.
Core earnings from interest and fee income rose to DKr1.14bn from DKr1.06bn
last year, but total financial earnings were hit by unrealised capital
losses arising from falling bond and share prices.
The market value adjustment for the value of securities and foreign exchange
was a negative DKr312m, against a positive DKr382m last year.
Loss provisions, however, were halved to DKr184m from DKr387m last year. The
total allowance for loan losses fell to DKr1.6bn, or 4.3 per cent of loans
and guarantees compared with 4.6 per cent at the beginning of the year.
Non-performing loans were reduced by 22 per cent to DKr1.2bn, said the bank.
The bank said it expected interest rates to fall from their high mid-year
level, enabling it to fulfil its forecast of a profit for the year of
between DKr200m and DKr300m.
However if interest rates remain at present levels profit will be cut to
DKr100m, the interim report stated.
