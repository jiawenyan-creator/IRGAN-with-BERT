FT  24 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: VAT probe will go ahead
AN INVESTIGATION by a cross-party committee of MPs into the impact on the
worst-off of extending value added tax to domestic fuel is to go ahead in
spite of the reservations of some of its Tory members.
Mr Frank Field, the Labour chairman of the social security committee, said
yesterday that members had agreed to consider who would be most affected by
the extension of VAT. It would also consider the mechanisms with which the
government could compensate poorer households.
This could include how extra help might be provided for people who are just
above income-support levels, and for people who are eligible for
income-related benefits, but do not claim them.
However, in response to the worries of some Tories, the committee will not
consider how much compensation should be provided until after the government
has announced its own proposals in November.
Confirmation of the inquiry came as Mr John Major once again had to defend
in the Commons the Budget decisions on VAT and on increasing National
Insurance contributions as being 'in the interests of the economy'.
Progress in deciding the form of the investigation is now unlikely until
after the committee has met Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary,
next month. The committee could be taking evidence at about the same time as
the Commons will be dealing with the measure in the detailed discussions on
the Finance Bill.
Some of the Conservative MPs on the committee have been irritated that their
colleague, Mr David Shaw, suggested such a politically sensitive inquiry
last week. They want to minimise possible embarrassment.
In practice, however, it may be difficult for the MPs to hold the inquiry
without considering the rises in fuel bills for particular groups, and thus
providing a figure for critics to use as a benchmark.
