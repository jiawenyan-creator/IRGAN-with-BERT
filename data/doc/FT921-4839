FT  06 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Coles Myer angered by
downgrading
MOODY'S, the US credit rating service, yesterday downgraded the debt rating
of paper issued by a subsidiary of Coles Myer, Australia's biggest retailer,
provoking an immediate and fiery response from the company.
The downgrading affects about ADollars 1bn of paper issued by Coles Myer
Finance, reducing its rating from A1 to Aa3.
Moody's said the action was based on a view of a weak Australian economy,
more selective consumers and stronger competition.
These factors would 'make it difficult for Coles Myer to both regain the
grocery market share it has lost during the last few years and attempt to
increase profitability and cash flow', the agency said.
'The rating action also recognises management's steps to improve operations,
cut costs, maintain profitability and regain lost grocery market share.'
Mr Brian Quinn, Coles Myer managing director, last night described the
Moody's downgrading as extremely hard to justify. He said it was
'extraordinary' that a credit change had been issued one week before release
of the company's interim results.
'I would have thought the responsible course of action would have been to
wait and find out the facts of our performance before making a pre-emptive
judgment,' he said.
