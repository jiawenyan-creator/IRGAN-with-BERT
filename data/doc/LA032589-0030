TROUBLED WATER(S) 
I have yet to determine why almost everyone I've ever met tacks the letter "S" 
onto the end (ends?) of words when it is totally inappropriate; (witness: "I'm 
Going to Lucky's Market"). However, this may be the final straw. 
KCET TV, Channel 28, in an add in the Calendar on March 8 actually touted the 
Simon &amp; Garfunkel concert in Central Park as featuring the song "Bridge 
Over Troubled Waters." 
Puh-lease! It's "Bridge Over Troubled Water." Singular . . . not plural. A 
minor point? Yes. But we should all attempt to be as accurate as we can be. 
Let's refer to it as Paul and Art presented it.
