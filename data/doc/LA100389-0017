THE NATION; 
TEXAS SCHOOL FUNDING RULED UNLAWFUL 
The Texas Supreme Court found "glaring disparities" between the state's rich 
and poor school districts and ruled that funding within the nation's 
second-largest system is unconstitutional. Spending varies by as much as 
$17,000 per pupil per year from rich to poor districts, the court found. The 
9-0 ruling could have enormous financial and social implications for the 
3.3-million-student Texas school system. The court found that the public school 
finance system violates the 113-year-old constitutional provision for an 
"efficient system" of public schools. It set a May 1, 1990, deadline for 
legislators to find a solution. The court said the state's school financing 
system is efficient neither financially nor in the sense of providing for a 
"general diffusion of knowledge." Public schools are funded largely through a 
combination of local property taxes and state aid.
