FT  14 AUG 93 / Jamaican minister resigns
Mr Hugh Small resigned yesterday as Jamaica's finance minister following
disagreements within the cabinet over proposed changes to the island's
foreign exchange market, Canute James reports from Kingston. In a letter to
Prime Minister P J Patterson, Mr Small said the changes, which were agreed
at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, were not in keeping with the government's
commitment to let the market determine the exchange rate.
