FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Portuguese group puts Es60m into
cable TV
A Portuguese company is to invest Es60bn (Dollars 430.7m) to supply cable
television to 2m homes over the next six years, using a fibre-optic network
that will enable the system to evolve into a multimedia information highway.
TV Cabo Portugal (TVCP), wholly owned by two of Portugal's state-owned
telecommunications operators, will choose a company to supply the
infrastructure for the project by April. It is negotiating with Philips of
the Netherlands, Siemens of Germany, Sirti of Italy and Intelcis of Spain.
The contract is estimated to be worth Es20,000 for each home supplied.
The company is also holding talks with 40 programme producers, mainly
European satellite TV companies. TVCP will offer a service of 30 channels
for Es5,000 a month plus an installation charge of Es15,000. Additional
channels will be added on a pay-per-view basis, pending the approval of new
legislation. Broadcasting is due to start in October.
TVCP will act as a holding company for nine regional cable TV operators. It
will own 51 per cent of each company. Municipal authorities and private
investors will subscribe to the rest of the capital through negotiation. The
regional companies are expected to be floated on the stock market after two
years.
