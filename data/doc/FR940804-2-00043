 

II. The Parties



3. The ``staff'' is the staff of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, an independent regulatory agency of the United
States established pursuant to section 4 of the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. 2053.

4. SD is a limited partnership created on December 24, 1987, under the laws of the State of New York, with its principal
offices located at 1200 Shames Drive, Westbury, New York. The sole general partner of SD is Gem Fulfillment Corp.,
1530 McDonald Ave., Brooklyn, New York. The president of Gem Fulfillment Corp. is David Weldler. The limited partners
of SD are Jerry Williams and Steven Brown. SD is engaged in the business of importing general merchandise
for resale to other companies.



III. Allegations of the Staff



5. In 1988, SD imported approximately 698,000 ``Santa Bear'' stuffed toy animals from China. The toys are subject
to, but some failed to comply with, the Commission's Small Parts Regulation, 16 CFR part 1501, in that when tested by
the staff in 1990 under 16 CFR 1500.52, (a) one or more parts of some of the tested toys separated and (b) one or more of
the parts that separated from the tested toys fit completely within the test cylinder, as set forth in 16 CFR 1501.4.
Accordingly, some of the Santa Bears present a ``mechanical hazard'' within the meaning of section 2(s) of the FHSA,
15 U.S.C. 1261(s). 

6. Most of the Santa Bears identified in paragraph 5 above were sold to the public by Raffoler, Ltd., a mail order business
that is owned by Jerry Williams and Stephen Brown and is located at the same address as SD.

7. Some of the Santa Bears identified in paragraph 5 above are a ``hazardous substance'' pursuant to section 2(f)(1)(D)
of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1261(f)(1)(D). Some of the Santa Bears identified in paragraph 5 above are also a ``banned hazardous
substance'' pursuant to section 2(q)(1)(A) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1)(A); and 16 CFR 1500.18(a)(9).

8. On November 7, 1990, the staff sent a certified letter to SD advising the firm that the Santa Bear contains small
parts and is considered to be a banned hazardous substance. Notice was provided that continued sale of the product
is prohibited by section 4 of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1263, and is punishable by penalties described in section 5 of the Act,
15 U.S.C. 1264. At this time, SD had an unsold inventory of approximately 110,000 Santa Bears.

9. On November 15, 1990, SD attempted to return its inventory of Santa Bears to the import agent from whom SD
had purchasedthe goods. On November 20, 1990, the import agent advised SD that it would not accept return of the
Santa Bears.

10. In or around early December 1990, an employee of SD asked a third party to attempt to find prospective purchasers
of the Santa Bears. The third party found a prospective purchaser and so advised the employee of SD. The sale of
the Santa Bears was consummated and SD received proceeds from the sale in the form of credit from the import agent
for goods previously purchased and for goods to be purchased in the future.
 
11. After receipt of the certified letter of November 7, 1990, from the staff, as described in paragraph 8 above, SD
knowingly caused the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of its remaining inventory
of approximately 110,000 Santa Bears, in violation of section 4(a) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1263(a), and for which a civil
penalty may be improved pursuant to section 5(c) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1264(c).



IV. Response of SD Importing Co.



12. SD denies the allegations of the staff set forth in paragraphs 5 through 11 above, including the allegations
that it has knowingly caused the introduction into commerce of the aforesaid banned hazardous toys and that it has
violated the FHSA.
