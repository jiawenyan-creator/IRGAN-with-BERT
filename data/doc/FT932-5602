FT  03 JUN 93 / Talks on rights nominee
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said yesterday he wanted to confer with leading
senators on his contested nomination of Ms Lani Guinier to run the Justice
Department's civil rights division, writes Jurek Martin in Washington.
He said Ms Guinier's record as a civil rights lawyer was 'first rate' and
insisted that many of the attacks on what are seen as her radical views
'cannot be supported by a fair reading of her writings'. But he added that
he had to take into account reservations expressed by key senators,
especially those Democrats who have doubted that she can win confirmation.
Ms Guinier, who is black and a Pennsylvania University law professor, is a
Clinton friend of 20 years standing. She has come under fire, initially from
the right wing, for having contended in academic articles that existing US
voting rights laws still offered insufficient protection for minorities.
The Guinier case is now reckoned a new litmus test of Mr Clinton's political
stance.
