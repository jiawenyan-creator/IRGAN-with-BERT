ASSEMBLY SPEAKER BROWN'S CHARTERED JET PROPOSAL 
So the sorry condition of public transportation is causing Brown a bit of 
trouble meeting his busy schedule and he proposes to resolve the problem by 
having the state lease an executive jet. 
Though we working stiffs might think it would make more sense for Brown and his 
colleagues to spend their energy and our resources doing something constructive 
about public transportation, we shouldn't be surprised if this fantasy comes to 
pass. And so a couple of suggestions to make the idea a little less 
unpalatable: 
At least 25% of the legislators' existing auto allowance should be deducted to 
support the plan. This might mean having to lease a Ford rather than a Lincoln, 
but most of us who elect the legislature have to scrimp a bit too, if we need a 
second car for work, and we have to deal with the tax code to get any sort of 
benefit. 
All use of the plane should be paid at commercial rates, and since the chances 
range between slim and none that this would be a "no-frills" operation (can't 
serve the constituents without a shower, a hot meal, a wet bar and a fax 
machine, can we?), payment should be equivalent to first-class rates.
