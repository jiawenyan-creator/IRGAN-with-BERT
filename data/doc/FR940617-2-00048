<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the Consumer Product Safety
Commission has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget a request for approval, through September 30, 1994,
of a collection of information consisting of a survey of persons who call the Commission's hotline.



Each year, about 170,000 members of the public call the Commission's toll-free hotline to report unsafe products
or to obtain information on product recalls, general safety information, or referrals to other federal, state, or
local health, safety or consumer agencies.

On September 11, 1993, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12862, which includes the requirement that agencies
``survey customers to determine the kind and quality of services they want and their level of satisfaction with existing
services.'' The Commission's hotline is a major point of contact between the Commission and the public, and is one
of the few activities of the Commission for which customer service can be objectively measured. Therefore, it is critical
for CPSC to determine how hotline callers are being served.

The Commission plans to conduct a Customer Satisfaction Survey by sampling approximately 600 hotline callers. This
survey will be conducted by telephone and will require about four minutes for each interview. The Commission will
use the results of this survey to implement E.O. 12862 and to determine both the current level of customer satisfaction
and the additional kind and quality of services desired by the public.
