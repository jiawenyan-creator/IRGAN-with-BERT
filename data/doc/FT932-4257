FT  10 JUN 93 / Warning over rail privatisation
TWO academics who support the government's rail privatisation plans warn in
a report published today that ministers may have seriously underestimated
the political risks of their policy.
Mr Stephen Glaister and Mr Tony Travers of the London School of Economics
warn that privatisation will create losers as well as gainers and that 'the
political or financial cost of placating them will be high'.
