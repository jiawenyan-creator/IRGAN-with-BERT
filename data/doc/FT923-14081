FT  09 JUL 92 / Arts: Phil Woods Quintet
Sixty two years old, Phil Woods is a serious-minded altoist who, like others
of his age, enthusiastically embraced all the revolutionary influences of
Charlie 'Bird' Parker.
Unlike the others, he did not inherit a fashionably fatal predilection for
alcohol and narcotics and was thus able to develop and expand the Parker
vocabulary to his own ends. He made his name with the big bands of Benny
Goodman, Dizzy Gillespie and Quincy Jones. After moving to Paris in the
Sixties (with Parker's former girl-friend) he began leading his own quartets
or quintets and refining his post-bop school of alto playing in earnest.
His current quintet is tight and bright as you would expect from a seasoned
leader like Woods. The rhythm section of bassist Steve Gilmore and drummer
Bill Goodwin have been with him since the mid-70s, while the composing
talent of pianist Jim McNeely is a more recent addition; young trumpeter
Brian Lynch completes a line-up made for a club setting. Neither chamber
jazz nor smoking hard bop, Woods' music swings intelligently with solos
shared out among the close harmonies of alto and trumpet.
It has been said more than once that his own playing gets better with time.
He manages to take the hysteria out of the alto without dulling its tart
tone. At other times, the phrasing is fluidly melodic.
In McNeely's 'Empty House' he conversed sweetly with the trumpet; with
'Quill' (dedicated to now-deceased friend and fellow altoist Gene Quill) he
punched through the swaying accompaniment of piano and rhythm section and,
with Al Cohn's 'Pensive", declaimed Bird-like, exploring the lower registers
of the instrument.
Phil Woods would certainly have happened without Parker, but the memory of
Parker might have been less vivid, and the legacy of Forties jazz less rich,
without Woods.
The Phil Woods Quintet is appearing at Ronnie Scott's Club until July 11
