FT  13 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rights issues prospect weighs
on equities
RIGHTS ISSUES in the pipeline, or merely in prospect, added to strike fears
in Germany to take the edge off continental equities yesterday, writes Our
Markets Staff.
MILAN sank to another 1992 low on fears that more companies would announce
capital increases to beat the privatisation programme expected from the
state holding company, Iri, in the second half of the year. Fiat lost L100
to L5,025 on rumours that it was planning a rights issue but then rebounded
L15 later. The Comit index fell 6.45 to 481.60 in turnover estimated at
L100bn after Monday's L86.6bn.
Burgo dropped L560 or 7.9 per cent to L6,570 as disconcerted traders
over-reacted to news of a 3 per cent drop in 1991 consolidated net earnings
and a dividend cut of L200 to L450.
The aeronautics group, Alenia, dropped L174 or 9.7 per cent to L1,620 on
reports that Germany wanted to scale down the Eurofighter programme.
PARIS fell back as traders got wind of a cash call from Pechiney
International, details of which emerged piecemeal after the close. Analysts
said that other companies were likely to take advantage of the market's
recent strength to make rights issues. Possible candidates were Accor and
Saint Gobain, they said. The CAC-40 index dropped 13.86 to 2,063.63 in heavy
turnover of FFr3.4bn.
Pechiney International fell FFr9 to FFr207 in anticipation of its funding
move. The state, which owns 60 per cent of Pechiney International via its
parent, Pechiney, is not going to exercise its warrants at the upcoming
striking date in June.
These warrants were taken on and exercised yesterday by a banking
consortium. Pechiney International said the new shares were being sold in a
private placement to investors in France and abroad.
Alcatel Alsthom, whose first quarter results were in line with expectations,
fell FFr18 to FFr661 on profit-taking.
Euro Disney dropped FFr5.70 or 4.4 per cent to FFr125.30 on a report that
attendance at the theme park was below target. Eurotunnel was another
casualty, dropping FFr1.35 or 5 per cent to FFr37.60 in 1.4m shares amid
talk that it would have a rights issue reserved for TML to resolve their
cost dispute.
FRANKFURT expressed concern about the prospect of a metalworkers' strike but
equities maintained their holding pattern. Following a 1.10 decline to
706.82 in the FAZ index at midsession, the DAX closed 1.87 lower at
1,751.16, market turnover easing from DM6.5bn to DM6.2bn.
Among carmakers, Daimler fell DM7 to DM782, dealers blaming reports that a
fighter jet which its Deutsche Aerospace unit had helped develop was
unlikely to be be built. Volkswagen fell DM4.30 to DM392, and this fall was
put down to profit-taking after its recent rally.
Dresdner Bank closed DM2.30 higher at DM359.80 for a two-day gain of DM6.80,
reflecting buying for Friday's dividend payment. Continental, the tyremaker,
recovered DM4.20 of Monday's DM11 loss to close at DM268.20, after the
downward revision of weekend rights issue expectations.
ZURICH broke its uptrend on general and specific grounds. Higher Swiss money
market rates weighed on the banking sector, within which SBC bearers dropped
SFr6 to SFr281.
After the close the US rating agency, Moody's, said that it had downgraded
SBC's senior debt to AA-1 from AAA, and SBC said that this would have no
material effect. The SMI index fell 12.9 to 1,950.8.
STOCKHOLM ran into profit-taking. The Affarsvarlden General index eased 8.1
to 1,006.4 in turnover of SKr576m after SKr677m.
Volvo fell back on disappointment that rumours of an early merger with
Renault had not been confirmed. Its B free shares fell SKr7 to SKr444.
Ericsson rose SKr1 to SKr135 on news of a SKr700m telephone system order in
Tokyo.
AMSTERDAM weakened slightly with the CBS Tendency index losing 0.2 to 130.2.
Buehrmann-Tetterode rose Fl 1.10 to Fl 49.40; it reported lower first
quarter profits, but forecast an improvement over the year. Ahold was 90
cents stronger at Fl 88 on better first quarter sales while
Internatio-Mueller put on Fl 2.30 or 3.5 per cent to Fl 67 ahead of
tomorrow's annual meeting.
MADRID lost ground on profit-taking. The general index fell 1.13 to 257.91
in turnover estimated at Pta14.5bn.
