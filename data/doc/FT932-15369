FT  14 APR 93 / Private cash for NHS 'welcome'
THE GOVERNMENT is examining ways of expanding the role of private financing
in the National Health Service as a means of improving the service provided
to NHS patients.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, said yesterday she would
'welcome' private-sector involvement in NHS projects - providing the service
benefited.
'We should not have a kind of apartheid between public and private sector,'
she said. 'Where private-sector skills, resources and capital can help us to
go forward, then I welcome it.'
Her remarks - given on BBC Radio's The World at One programme - followed the
publication of a paper on opportunities for using private finance in the NHS
by Mr David Willetts, a backbench Tory MP and former member of the Downing
Street policy unit.
The paper says hospitals should be free to use private-sector funding to
finance new facilities. It says liberalisation of the Department of Health's
current capital control procedures would be a 'crucial' first step in giving
private providers the opportunity to tender for new NHS developments.
Mrs Bottomley said the NHS had already worked with the private sector on a
range of projects, such as the government's initiative to reduce waiting
lists. Other opportunities for private involvement existed 'in a rather
tentative form'.
Separately, the Department of Health said the government was keen to see
innovative ideas proposed for bringing new funds into the health service but
would 'never go down the road so far as Mr Willetts has suggested'.
For Labour, Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the ideas
contained in the paper did nothing to tackle the central problem of health
service underfunding.
