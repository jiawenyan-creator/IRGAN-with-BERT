FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Waterford Foods pays Pounds 7.4m for Dairy
Crest's Durham dairy
DAIRY CREST, the milk and dairy products group, has sold another dairy in
its programme to reconfigure the business ahead of next year's flotation.
The buyer is Waterford Foods, the Irish dairy group whose strategy is to
expand its UK market share.
Waterford is buying Dairy Crest's Durham dairy, with 22 distribution depots
and its ex-farm haulage fleet, for Pounds 7.4m free of debt. The business
has annual operating profits of Pounds 2.5m on sales of Pounds 18m, and net
assets of Pounds 4.5m.
Dairy Crest has sold four other dairies this year and closed another.
The milk industry is in a state of flux ahead of next year's abolition of
the milk marketing board, which currently owns Dairy Crest.
The Durham dairy handles 9m gallons of milk a year, most of which is sold
through 220 doorstep milk rounds in Durham and Northumberland.
The deal will give Waterford about 5 per cent of the liquid milk market in
England and Wales. Waterford, which has approaching 30 per cent of the
market in the Manchester area, said this was its first step into the
north-east region. The dairy has about a 12 per cent stake of that regional
market.
Waterford's strategy is to build up significant regional market shares. It
introduces its 'Waterford Standard' to milk rounds to combat the decline in
the share of the liquid milk market that doorstep delivery takes. This
includes delivery by 8am, and enabling customers to change orders on a free
telephone number until the midnight before delivery.
