BOYCOTTING SAN JOSE ST. PLAYERS OBTAIN LEGAL COUNSEL 
The 10 San Jose State basketball players who are boycotting practices and games 
in protest of Coach Bill Berry's treatment of them may sue if their 
scholarships are revoked, a lawyer with Melvin M. Belli's firm said Friday. 
The players, who have accused Berry of "mental cruelty" and refused to practice 
or play again until Berry resigns or is fired, met with attorney Paul Monzione 
Thursday and are scheduled to meet today with Belli, the San Francisco lawyer 
who has been called the "king of torts." Belli did not meet with the players 
earlier because he was out of the country. 
"We're very concerned that these young men don't lose any of their scholarship 
benefits or their right to play for the school," said Monzione, who termed 
Berry's treatment of the players "shocking" according to what the players had 
told him. 
San Jose State has backed Berry but has not announced a decision regarding the 
scholarships, which under National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules could be 
rescinded before the new semester begins next week, since the players left the 
team voluntarily. 
Before San Jose State lost to Cal State Fullerton Thursday with a makeshift 
team that included four football players, Athletic Director Randy Hoffman 
indicated that the scholarships likely will be revoked. 
"If a student-athlete makes a decision, they need to be responsible for it," 
Hoffman said. 
Repeated attempts to reach Berry for comment Friday were unsuccessful. 
Hoffman, the athletic director, backed Berry repeatedly on Thursday, 
acknowledging that last year he had told Berry to "mellow" in his treatment of 
players and officials this year. 
"I think he's done that," Hoffman said. "I don't know if it's a requirement for 
athletes to be happy all the time."
