FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Bradford &amp; Bingley hit by higher bad debts
BRADFORD &amp; Bingley building society revealed a 15.3 per cent drop in pre-tax
profits for 1992 after making provisions for bad mortgage debts of Pounds
81m, compared with Pounds 30.4m in 1991.
After the provisions, pre-tax profits for the year were Pounds 91.3m (Pounds
107.8m).
Operating profits increased from Pounds 138.2m to Pounds 172.3m, helped by a
widening in interest margins. Net interest receivable was higher at Pounds
237m (Pounds 201.4m), despite the effect of Pounds 44.5m of interest deemed
to be irrecoverable.
The society, Britain's seventh largest, said that 'continuing recession and
rising unemployment caused some difficulties for mortgage borrowers. As a
result arrears levels remain high, although possessions taken in during the
year were more than 38 per cent below 1991.'
The society's assets grew 9.6 per cent over the year to Pounds 13.1bn and
reserves rose to Pounds 552.7m (Pounds 489.8m).
Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said
the results were creditable considering that the society was facing the
difficulty of absorbing Leamington Spa, with which it merged in 1991.
