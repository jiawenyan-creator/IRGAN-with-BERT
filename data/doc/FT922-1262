FT  23 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Cash trading quiet
THERE WAS little activity on the UK money markets yesterday, which were
described by one trader as 'deathly'.
Interbank rates barely moved on the day and trading on the sterling futures
market, which took a long time to warm up, was extremely thin. The slightly
better than expected trade figures caused a ripple of enthusiasm but
generally failed to make an impact.
Said one trader: 'I think most people are fairly devoid of inspiration at
the moment.'
Overnight rates touched 12 per cent twice during the morning, once before
the Bank of England announced the day's shortage, and again after only
limited assistance was given in the early round.
The three-month interbank rate firmed slightly to 10 1/16 per cent from last
Friday's close, while further out, six-month money ended at 10 per cent.
The Bank of England's initial forecast liquidity shortage was Pounds 1.85bn.
Assistance in the early round amounted to Pounds 218m and included Pounds
50m of band-1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 78m of band-1 bank
bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 50m of band-3 bank bills at 9 21/32 and
Pounds 40m of band-4 bank bills at 9 19/32 per cent.
Later in the morning the shortage was all but removed when the Bank bought
bills totalling Pounds 1.4bn. This included a further Pounds 476m of band-1
bills at the same rate as before, Pounds 314m of band-2 bills at 9 7/8 per
cent, and Pounds 167m of band-3 bills and Pounds 73m of band-4 bills, both
at the same rate as before.
The shortage was revised to Pounds 1.9bn in the afternoon. The Bank
intervened once more to buy Pounds 256m of bands-1 and 2 bills at 9 7/8 per
cent.
On the sterling futures market, the September short sterling ended unchanged
at 90.25 with only 7,869 lots traded.
The Bank of Finland, the Finnish central bank, will institute a new system
for regulating the supply of bank liquidity in a move to create a better
functioning market, it was announced yesterday. The change, which takes
effect on July 1, will do away with the current fixed call money rate and
penalty rate. Instead, commercial banks' deposit and loan rates will be tied
to the central bank's tender rate, the weighted average of all accepted bids
for central bank funds or certificates offered for sale in the money market.
