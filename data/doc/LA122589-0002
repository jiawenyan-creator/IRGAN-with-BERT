PACKERS NOW COUNTING ON BENGALS; 
PACKERS: AFTER 20-10 VICTORY OVER DALLAS, THEY STILL HAVE A CHANCE FOR THEIR 
FIRST PLAYOFF BERTH SINCE 1982. 
The Packers put themselves in position to win their first divisional title in 
17 seasons and brought an end to the Dallas Cowboys' second-worst season. 
Green Bay beat Dallas, 20-10, Sunday and would win the NFC Central and go the 
playoffs for the first time since 1982 if the Minnesota Vikings lose to the 
Cincinnati Bengals tonight. 
Green Bay was eliminated from wild-card contention when the Rams beat New 
England, 24-20. The Packers saw the end of the Ram-Patriot game on television 
and were disappointed when the New England failed to score from the Rams' 
five-yard line at the end. 
"We're big Cincinnati fans now," Lion Coach Lindy Infante said. 
Green Bay's 10-6 record was its best in 17 years. It was the 14th consecutive 
home loss for Dallas, an NFL record. 
"We knew this wouldn't be an easy one, coming into a place where you are 
supposed to win is never easy," Infante said. "We've been playing sudden death 
football for six weeks now. Regardless of what happens we have a lot to be 
proud of." 
Dallas finished at 1-15 in Jimmy Johnson's rookie year as coach. The only 
Cowboys team to do worse was in 1960, when they finished 0-11-1. 
"Well, it's behind us," Johnson said. "The Cowboys will have better days in the 
future." 
Johnson said that the season for Dallas was to assess everything for the 
future. 
"It was a season of evaluation, " he said. "It was a situation where we sat 
back and watched. Next year we will take care of business." 
Green Bay's go-ahead touchdown came on a five-yard scoring pass from Majkowski 
to tight end Ed West with 3:58 left in the third quarter. 
Mark Murphy's fourth-quarter fumble recovery at the Green Bay 30 set up a 
63-yard drive that ended with Chris Jacke's 24-yard field goal with 3:24 left. 
The Cowboys tied the score, 10-10, on former Trojan Jack Del Rio's 57-yard 
fumble return with 6:51 left in the third quarter. Jon Carter caused the fumble 
when he hit Brent Fullwood, who was attempting to handoff on a reverse. 
A crowd of 41,265 fans watched in 35-degree cold. The Cowboys announced 55,000 
tickets were sold.
