FT  15 FEB 94 / Observer: Super-trolley
Supermarket trolley drivers are becoming more sophisticated.
When Britain's Gateway supermarket chain started fitting calculators to its
trolleys, it thought they would be used for mundane calculations, such as
totting up the bill.
Not so. It seems that more and more customers are using the gadgets for
complicated calculations such as whether a 500 gramme product at 48p is
better value than a 200g version at 21p.
Gateway's shoppers still have far to go to catch up with their US
counterparts where healthy shoppers mainly use the calculators to add up the
calories.
