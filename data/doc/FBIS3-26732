  [Text] Beijing, 7 Feb (XINHUA) -- To simplify and 
standardize the tax system, and to promote reform aimed at 
establishing a tax-sharing system, the State Council recently 
decided to abolish the fair trade tax, the livestock trade tax, 
the special fuel tax, the bonus tax, and the wage regulatory 
tax. It also decided to abrogate seven tax codes: "Provisions 
for Trial Implementation Regarding Fair Trade Taxes," "Interim 
Regulations on Livestock Trade Taxes," "Provisions for Trial 
Implementation on Collecting Special Fuel Taxes," "Interim 
Provisions on Bonus Taxes on State-Run Enterprises," "Interim 
Provisions on Wage Regulatory Taxes on State-Run Enterprises," 
"Interim Provisions on Bonus Taxes on Collective Enterprises," 
and "Interim Provisions on Bonus Taxes on Institutions." 
Meanwhile, it delegated power regarding the management of 
animal slaughter and banquet taxes, allowing provincial, 
autonomous regional, and municipal people's governments to 
decide on their own whether to continue to levy or stop 
collecting such taxes in light of local economic development.
