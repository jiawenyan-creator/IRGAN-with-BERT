FT  04 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Scottish constitutional review is
downplayed
MINISTERS are trying to dispel expectations that the exercise of 'taking
stock' of the constitutional position of Scotland will lead to radical
changes.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, told MPs yesterday that there would be
nothing in the government's proposals to undermine the integrity of the
United Kingdom or Scotland's place in it.
Other ministers have been hinting privately at a 'minimalist' solution. One
of the main elements will be greater use of the Scottish grand committee -
made up of all 72 Scottish MPs - for handling Scottish business in the
Commons.
The deal is also likely to include more administrative devolution from
Whitehall to the Scottish office. It is due to be considered by the cabinet
today and to be announced by Mr Lang next week.
Ministers for other departments who were involved in the exercise have been
highlighting the danger of an 'English backlash' if the government were seen
to be conceding too much to the Scottish lobby, particularly since the
Tories' 11 of the 72 Scottish seats is a much higher total than was
predicted.
It is already clear that the government's proposals fall far short of what
the opposition parties are pressing for.
The Scottish Office is considering the controversial step of putting its
proposals for local government and the Scottish water industry into a single
bill next session to help ease pressure on the government's legislative
programme.
