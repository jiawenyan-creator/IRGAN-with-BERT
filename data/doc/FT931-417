FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: CrestaCare announces changes
NEW INVESTORS and a new chief executive were announced yesterday by
CrestaCare, the nursing home group currently withdrawing from its
problematic property interests.
Mr Andrew Taee has become chief executive, replacing Mr John McAllister who
resigned with immediate effect. Mr Taee arranged the purchase of a 24.04 per
cent stake in the group from Asia Securi-ties International by a range of
institutions and private individuals at a price of 31 1/2 p. CrestaCare's
shares closed yesterday at 35p, up 4p.
The deal was completed on Sunday, after Mr Taee flew to Hong Kong last week
to make Asia Securities an offer for the stake. No broker was involved. Asia
Securities had built the stake over a number of years but following a change
of ownership no longer found it an appropriate investment, Mr Taee said.
He said yesterday that Mr McAllister had done 'an excellent job in cleaning
up the balance sheet and focusing the group on the healthcare sector'. Now,
he said, he would take the group on from there.
Mr Taee is chairman and a principal shareholder in Grosvenor House Group,
which leases three nursing homes to CrestaCare. He also owns Premier
Healthcare (UK), one of the new investors in CrestaCare with a 1.91 per cent
stake.
Four institutions took the bulk of Asia Securities' stake, Schroder
Investment Management, with 9.54 per cent, Gartmore Investment with 5.72 per
cent, Morgan Grenfell Asset Management 3.81 per cent and Mercury Asset
Management 1.91 per cent.
