WORLD; 
ENVOY BLAMES SOVIETS FOR REFUGEES 
U.S. Ambassador to Geneva Morris Abram charged today that Soviet-style 
socialism is responsible for creating millions of refugees and said Moscow 
should help repair the damage. 
He told reporters that Moscow paid no contribution to the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees while the United States alone contributed $119 
million this year, a quarter of the organization's 1989 budget, although it 
bore no responsibility.
