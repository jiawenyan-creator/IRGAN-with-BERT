FT  23 MAY 92 / PLO wins West Bank 'election'
The Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday won a clear victory over
Islamic fundamentalists in a rare election in the West Bank, writes Hugh
Carnegy in Jerusalem.
PLO-backed candidates nine of the 12 posts in the Nablus chamber of commerce
against three for Islamic candidates.
Elections to chambers of commerce have been almost the only test of
political opinion since Israel scrapped municipal elections.
