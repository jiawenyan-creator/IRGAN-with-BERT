FT  06 FEB 93 / Council seeks to to save van plant
BIRMINGHAM City Council is trying to turn local expressions of support for
Leyland Daf's operations at Washwood Heath into a scheme that would secure
the future of the long-established van production plant.
Council officials plan to meet the local Leyland Daf management on Tuesday.
The officials said they had stated their interests when they saw the
administrative receivers - Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop of
accountants Arthur Andersen.
Yesterday the two receivers met their Dutch counterparts at DAF's Eindhoven
headquarters and 'agreed to co-operate together to meet their mutual supply
requirements'.
In a statement afterwards Mr Talbot added that meanwhile 'steps have been
taken to ensure that production is continuing at all the UK sites'.
Mr Will Rogers, head of Birmingham council's investment services, said:
'Tremendous support locally has been gathering about the future of this
business.' He cited dealers, suppliers and organisations such as the
Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, Birmingham Heartlands Development
Corporation and the West Midlands Development Agency.
'We have to establish the facts, what the realistic options are and how we
can translate this support into action,' Mr Rogers added.
He also noted that the council had in the past supported management buy-outs
and had taken a minority interest in them. A management buy-out has already
been proposed for the Leyland Daf plant at Leyland, Lancashire.
The West Midlands Development Agency, responsible for securing inward
investment, is interested in assisting any potential overseas buyer.
