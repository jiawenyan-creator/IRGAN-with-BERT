CSUN AWAITING DECISION ON CONFERENCE TRIP 
A meeting today between the president and the athletic director of Cal State 
Sacramento could go a long way toward determining whether Cal State Northridge 
will become a member of the proposed American Conference. 
Bob Hiegert, Northridge athletic director, said Wednesday that if Sacramento 
decides to take part in a planning meeting in Marco Island, Fla., on Sunday, he 
also likely will attend. 
After meeting with Northridge President James W. Cleary on Wednesday, Hiegert 
said, "I think (Cleary) is curious to see what Sacramento is going to do." 
United States International University, Southern Utah State, Northeastern 
Illinois and Chicago State reportedly are prepared to join the American 
Conference. 
The addition of Northridge and Sacramento would give the conference six teams, 
the minimum required by the NCAA in Division I.
