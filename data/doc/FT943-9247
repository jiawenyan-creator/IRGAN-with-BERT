FT  12 AUG 94 / People: Foresight saga
The government's Office of Science and Technology has appointed scores of
advisory committees during its two years in existence. But never before has
one had the style and glamour of the Technology Foresight Panel announced
this week to cover the 'learning and leisure sector'.
Its chairman is Peter Wallis. Peter who? Wallis is better known as the
author, broadcaster and style guru Peter York, who coined the famous term
Sloane Ranger. Other members include: David Puttnam (above), the film
director; Janet Street-Porter of the BBC; Anthony Smith, president of
Magdalen College, Oxford; Neil Chalmers, head of the Natural History Museum;
and Alexander Korda, guru of hi-tech venture capital.
The panel is one of 15 appointed by the Cabinet Office to look at prospects
for technological progress in its sector and match these with the strengths
and weaknesses of British industry. By the end of the Technology Foresight
exercise next year, the government hopes to have a list of priorities for
research within and across all sectors of science and business.
Wallis/York says his panel would look particularly at 'the fast growth area
of new electronic and education media. The contribution these can make to
national income but also to our quality of life is not always fully
recognised - partly because the businesses are so varied but also because
they cut across many traditional areas of industry.'
Puttnam adds: 'We are in reach of the 'fully wired home' in which not only
conventional entertainment but interactive education and information
services will be available on demand - at a price.'
