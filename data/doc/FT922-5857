FT  28 MAY 92 / Pay offer of 3.8% for council staff
LOCAL GOVERNMENT white-collar workers may receive one of the lowest pay
settlements in the public sector this year after employers yesterday offered
a 3.8 per cent rise in basic pay.
The offer, up from a previous 3.6 per cent, was dismissed by Nalgo, the main
union in the negotiations, as unrealistically low. Mr Dennis Reed, Nalgo
local-government officer, said he hoped for a negotiated settlement but
added that industrial action was possible.
The talks cover about 750,000 workers and set the tone for negotiations for
1m manual workers in local government who traditionally receive a similar
rise.
The offer compares with proposed settlements for the majority of Britain's
civil servants of between 4.5 per cent and 4.75 per cent including
performance-related pay provisions. Some health workers have been offered
more.
Council associations are to consult authorities on their opinions on a
settlement. However, Mr Steve Bubb, assistant secretary at the Association
of Metropolitan Authorities, said there would be no dramatic movement.
The revenue support grant allowance for inflation was 4.8 per cent but
authorities argue that there is less than that available for white-collar
workers. That is in part because of a 7.5 per cent rise for teachers which
was determined by a pay review body.
