FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Wardle Storeys edges ahead
Wardle Storeys, the plastic and safety equipment group, yesterday dismissed
talk of an economic recovery in the UK as 'election fever' after announcing
a marginal rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 4.29m to Pounds 4.36m, for
the six months to February 29.
Mr Brian Taylor, chief executive, said: 'You have to be a fully paid up
member of a political party to believe that a recovery has taken place. Talk
of recovery is not connected with rational thought; there is no evidence of
any upturn.'
A strong performance from parachutes and life rafts enabled the group to
report its first profit increase since November 1990 on reduced sales of
Pounds 24.8m (Pounds 28.3m). Operating profits from safety and survival
equipment, tailored to special forces unconnected with the recent defence
cuts, rose to Pounds 1.83m (Pounds 1.43m).
The interim dividend is maintained at 4p.
