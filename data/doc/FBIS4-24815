<F P=106> [Report: "Li Yonggui, Deputy Director of State </F>
Administration of Taxation, Says Land Value-Added Tax Is 
Centrally Enforced and Not To Be Changed by the Local 
Authorities"] 
  [Text] Li Yonggui, deputy director of the State 
Administration of Taxation, said yesterday in Hong Kong that, 
while land value-added tax is based on local tax structures, and 
local authorities therefore should be allowed to set a suitable 
rate for themselves as the economy develops, at the present 
stage it is enforced by the central authorities, and the local 
authorities are not allowed to raise or reduce it on their own. 
  At a seminar titled "China's Taxation, Financial Reform, and 
Hong Kong's Economy," Li Yonggui reiterated that the central 
authorities would not postpone levying the new tax, however 
strong the reactions from the outside world. The new tax is now 
being held up pending the announcement of the implementation 
procedures and will be enforced once they are in place, which he 
predicted will be before the end of this year. 
  Referring to the recent announcement of a 30 percent rise in 
state tax revenue, Li Yonggui denied that the new tax would 
increase burdens for enterprises, explaining that the higher tax 
revenue came mainly from the abolition of past preferential 
policies or tax reductions or moratoriums.
