FT  24 JUN 93 / Low interest rates boost unit trusts
LOW INTEREST rates continue to be good news for the unit trust industry. Net
sales of Pounds 914m in May pushed funds under management to Pounds 73.8bn,
a historical high.
With base rates at 6 per cent it is possible for many equity funds to offer
competitive rates to UK private investors.
The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds says that retail sales
of UK equity unit trusts in the first five months of this year were Pounds
1.21bn compared with Pounds 140.7m in the corresponding period last year.
