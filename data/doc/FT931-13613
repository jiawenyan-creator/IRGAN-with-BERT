FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Equity underwriting slide
depresses Bear Stearns
BEAR STEARNS, the US securities house, yesterday reported a 17 per cent
decline in second-quarter profits to Dollars 64.3m, the latest indication
that the boom in Wall Street earnings slowed down at the end of last year.
The main feature of the quarter, which covered the period from October to
December, was a sharp fall in equity underwriting volume, which led to a 34
per cent decline in Bear Stearns' investment banking revenues to Dollars
63.2m.
There was a similar, if less pronounced, setback in trading earnings, which
slipped nearly 3 per cent to Dollars 231.6m in the wake of less favourable
conditions in fixed-income markets.
Interest income also contributed to the overall decline, falling to Dollars
225.5m, from Dollars 260.3m a year ago.
Bear Stearns' other main line of business, however, put in a strong
second-quarter performance.
Revenues from broking commissions jumped to Dollars 105.5m, up from Dollars
97.7m at the same stage of fiscal 1992, as a result of higher equity trading
volume and an increase in the number of the firm's correspondent clearing
clients.
Bear Stearns is the second brokerage firm this week to report lower
quarterly earnings because of a downturn in investment banking and trading
revenues.
This indicates that business conditions in the final three months of 1992
were nothing like as profitable as in the first three quarters of last year,
when Wall Street firms were firing on all cylinders.
The final three months of 1992, however, may turn out to have been a brief
interruption of an upward trend.
The first few weeks of 1993 have opened strongly for the securities
industry, with extremely heavy trading of equities, and record levels of new
corporate debt coming to the market.
Mr Alan Greenberg, chairman of Bear Stearns, said yesterday: 'Business has
been good since the beginning of January, and we hope it will continue.'
