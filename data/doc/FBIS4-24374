  [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- China is willing to 
strengthen friendly cooperation with all European countries, 
including poland, Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen 
said here today when meeting with Jozef Oleksy, speaker of 
Poland's House of Representatives. 
  The world was now in a multi-polarized period, Qian said. It 
is a positive phenomenon that each country now is solving 
domestic affairs independently while keeping in touch with other 
countries. 
  Qian, who visited Poland three years ago, said he was glad 
to 
see the achievements Poland had made in its economy in recent 
years, which would provide more possibilities for expanding 
Sino-Polish economic and trade cooperation, he said. 
  The relations between the two countries, including economic 
and trade cooperation, have greatly improved in recent years. 
Qian said he was looking forward to seeing more exchanges and 
cooperation in all fields, especially in economy and trade, 
between the two countries. 
  Jozef Oleksy said that the relations between the two 
countries were developing well on the whole and their bilateral 
cooperation would have a bright future. 
  Oleksy and his party started their official good-will visit 
to China yesterday as guests of the Standing Committee of 
China's National People's Congress.
