FT  07 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: TGVs keep better time than stated
Sir, The letter from Ian MacKellar that you carried under the heading 'Not
really. . . ' on November 24 contains a serious inaccuracy in the number of
TGVs (Train a Grande Vitesse) arriving at their destination within 14
minutes of their scheduled time.
The figure, quoted at 74.9 per cent, is in fact 91.8 per cent for TGV Sud
Est and 96.8 per cent for TGV Atlantique. And I must add for the comparison
to be accurate that the SNCF runs 1,300 intercity trains daily.
The letter also implies that TGV is subsidised by the French government.
This is most definitely not the case. State subsidy is more by way of a
grant which is channelled into the 'social railway' and not into mainline
services.
