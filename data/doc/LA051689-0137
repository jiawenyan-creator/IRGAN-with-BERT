METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 OFFICIALS BACK PLAN TO EXTEND RAIL LINE 
Seeking to unite San Fernando Valley leaders behind a single rail proposal, two 
elected officials on Friday endorsed a plan to extend the Metro Red Line partly 
underground from North Hollywood to the Sepulveda Basin, where passengers would 
then transfer to buses. 
In supporting a westward extension to Encino of the downtown-to-North Hollywood 
subway, state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) and Los Angeles City Councilman 
Marvin Braude became the first local elected officials to endorse a specific 
rail route. 
Several others have condemned specific routes, but most have said they are 
waiting for the results of a County Transportation Commission study expected in 
September. 
A key aspect of their plan is halting the rail line at Balboa Boulevard. 
Planners have found no way other than costly tunneling to get trains through 
the West Valley without disturbing some residents.
