  [Text] After an hour of talks with Serbian President 
Milosevic, which were held behind closed doors, Charles Redman 
[U.S. President's special envoy] made a statement for 
journalists. Jelena Hinic reports: 
  [Hinic] Redman said that the peace negotiations are going 
though a very important stage and that all the protagonists are 
trying to find comprehensive solutions for Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
which, as he said, will bring more stability to the entire 
region. He said that the United States' efforts concerning an 
agreement between the Bosnian Croats and Muslims have yielded 
fruit. He also positively assessed reports that the military 
forces in central Bosnia are withdrawing from the front lines. 
  Redman said that the agreement between the Bosnian Croats 
and 
Muslims is not enough and that a comprehensive solution for 
Bosnia also requires the participation of the Bosnian Serbs. 
  In reply to the question of whether President Milosevic 
supported this plan during today's talks, Redman said: 
  [Begin Redman recording, in English with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] The negotiations today were of 
course still preliminary, but I wanted to be sure that President 
Milosevic understands what we are trying to do with the Bosnian 
Muslims and Croats. Our intention is to work, I hope rapidly, 
in the direction of an overall solution on Bosnia. We believe 
that all the regional protagonists play an important role in the 
work on this agreement. We expect President Milosevic and other 
leaders in the region to take a very active part in this, as we 
are now trying to move to the second phase in the 
solution-searching process. [end recording] 
  [Hinic] Answering a journalist's question on whether there 
was any mention in the talks of a possible confederation of the 
former Yugoslav republics, Redman said that such plans did not 
exist at this moment. He said that the central issue for the 
Bosnian Serbs at present is whether they accept the offer to 
join the Muslim-Croat confederation. However, regardless of 
this answer, important decisions must be made on territories, 
because it was the question of territories that have been 
blocking all solutions to Bosnia so far, Redman said. 
  We should now determine how the different sides in Bosnia 
will build relations among themselves. This is something that 
they must agree on themselves, U.S. envoy Charles Redman 
stressed in conclusion.
