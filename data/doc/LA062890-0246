NAMES IN THE NEWS; 
JUSTICE DEPT. OFFICIAL RESIGNS 
The head of the Justice Department's criminal division today announced his 
resignation to enter private law practice, creating another vacancy in the 
agency's top ranks. 
Assistant Atty. Gen. Edward S. G. Dennis Jr., a career federal prosecutor who 
has headed the criminal division since 1988, said in a letter to Atty. Gen. 
Dick Thornburgh that he plans to leave the Justice Department on Aug. 31. 
Dennis, who is the first black to head the Justice Department's criminal 
division, said in a statement that he will become a senior partner at the 
Philadelphia law firm of Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius. 
Dennis' departure adds another vacancy to the top echelons of the Justice 
Department, which has been plagued by a series of personnel difficulties under 
Thornburgh. 
But officials stressed that Dennis' resignation is unrelated to the recent 
staff turmoil, which came to a head in May when Deputy Atty. Gen. Donald B. 
Ayer resigned. 
Nevertheless, two sources said Dennis had grown frustrated with Thornburgh's 
management style, which had centralized decision-making in the attorney 
general's office.
