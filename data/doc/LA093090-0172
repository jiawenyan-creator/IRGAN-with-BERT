BILL TO BAN FISHING OF CROAKER IS VETOED 
For the second straight year, Gov. George Deukmejian has rejected legislation 
to ban the commercial harvest of white croaker fish off the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula. 
In a veto message Thursday, Deukmejian described the latest bill, written by 
Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), as unnecessary because the state 
Department of Fish and Game has closed the area to commercial white croaker 
fishing under emergency regulations. 
Deukmejian said he expects the fishing ban to become permanent. 
The ban was ordered in May after a state health study determined that white 
croaker in Peninsula waters pose a cancer risk because they contain excessive 
levels of DDT and PCBs.
