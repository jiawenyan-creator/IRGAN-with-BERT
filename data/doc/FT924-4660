FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pemex signs Dollars 100m trade
finance facility
PETROLEOS Mexicanos, Mexico's state-owned oil company, has signed a Dollars
100m trade finance facility with a group of international banks.
Bankers say the financing, led by ANZ International Merchant Banking and
Chemical Bank, is the second syndicated loan facility signed by Pemex since
Mexico's debt rescheduling in 1982. The first was a Dollars 100m trade
financing facility this year led by Chase Manhattan.
The maximum margin of the new facility - to finance the import or to
prefinance exports of oil products - is 7/8 - point over London interbank
offered rates (Libor). The borrower can also use the sterling bankers'
acceptance market, which might mean below Libor funding if swapped into
dollars.
