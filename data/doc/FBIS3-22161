  [Text] Tokyo, Feb 22 KYODO -- The average amount of 
nonindustrial waste per capita in Japan decreased marginally in 
fiscal 1991 for the first time in eight years in what the Health 
and Welfare Ministry said Tuesday [22 February] could be the 
start of a new trend. 
  The ministry said the average person threw out 1,118 grams 
of 
garbage per day during the year, two grams per day less than in 
the previous year. 
  The 1991 fiscal year ran from 1 April 1991 to 31 March 1992. 
  The ministry said that although the economy was still 
booming 
at the time, the very slight decrease may represent the 
beginning of a change in consumption habits with more people 
becoming aware of the need to create less garbage. 
  But despite the decline in the per person average, the 
overall amount of nonindustrial garbage actually increased. 
  Nonindustrial garbage thrown out during the year weighed a 
record of about 50.77 million tons. This was some 0.6 percent 
more than the previous year. 
  The cost of disposing of the garbage, including collection, 
transport and disposal, amounted to 1,998.6 billion yen, an 
increase of about 14 percent over the previous year. 
  It was the 10th consecutive increase in the annual cost of 
dealing with the nation's garbage. 
  The cost per person was about 12,800 yen, up from 11,200 yen 
the previous year. 
  About 17 percent of the garbage was buried in landfill and 
about 73 percent was incinerated. 
  Data on industrial waste is released separately, but in 
fiscal 1990, industrial waste amounted to about eight times the 
weight of nonindustrial waste.
