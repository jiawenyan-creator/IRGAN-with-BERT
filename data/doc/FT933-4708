FT  08 SEP 93 / Tax move stuns Indian bourses
INDIAN bourses yesterday fell sharply for a second day, in reaction to a
freeze imposed by internal revenue authorities on shareholdings valued at
more than Rs. l5bn (Pounds 31m).
On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the country's largest, the index of 30 leading
shares fell sharply by 87.67 points to 2,533,53 making a two-day decline of
130.53 points or 4.9 per cent. Investors stayed clear of making purchases to
avoid being saddled with losses in a falling market.
The income tax authorities at the weekend conducted searches inquiring into
234 people in Bombay, 132 in Calcutta and an unspecified number in other
centres on a tip-off they were trading on behalf of Mr Harshad Mehta, one of
the central figures in the Rs50bn Bombay securities scandal.
Traders fear the stock markets will come to a standstill - recalling the
events in May last year, when the custodian appointed by the government
declared all the shares handled by Mr Mehta as 'tainted'.
The BSE has banned short sales and all sales will have to be against cash. A
15 per cent cash payment has been made obligatory on fresh purchases. The
internal revenue authorities are expected to complete investigations by the
weekend.
