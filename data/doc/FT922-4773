FT  03 JUN 92 / Swiss petition campaign succeeds against fighter order
THE Swiss cabinet has proposed delaying a Dollars 2.3bn order of 34
McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 fighters following the success of a petition
campaign against it, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. Many Swiss business
leaders, who are also top army officers, are appalled at the unprecedented
popular intervention in procurement decisions. But others think the
country's security needs have changed, and a sophisticated fighter like the
F/A-18 is no longer needed.
