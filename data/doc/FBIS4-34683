  [Text] Today, the United Workers Front, FUT, which groups 
the country's major unions, called for a general strike next 
Tuesday. It also called for marches and demonstrations all over 
the country starting today, Wednesday, although the state of 
emergency President Sixto Duran Ballen decreed last night is 
still in force. The labor groups made their decision at 1430, 
and a union spokesman made the announcement. 
  The FUT reached its decision after a meeting that lasted 
several hours. The unity of the people will decide matters, the 
group said. Duran Ballen decreed a state of emergency on Tuesday 
night when protests in the country, begun by Indians and 
peasants on 13 June, escalated. The Indians and peasants began 
protesting immediately after the approval of an agrarian law 
that they describe as racist and illegal. There are 
approximately five million Indians in Ecuador. The union members 
decried the militarization of the country with the enforcement 
of the state of emergency and said that despite the state of 
emergency, several major and secondary highways remain blocked, 
something the government military chiefs denied earlier.
