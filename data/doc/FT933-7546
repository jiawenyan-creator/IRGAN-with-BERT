FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Recovery at Den Danske Bank
DEN DANSKE BANK, the largest Danish bank, reports pre-tax profits of
DKr2.37bn (Dollars 344m) for the first six months of 1993, compared with
DKr6m in the first half of 1992.
The turnround is almost entirely due to increased net interest income
following a steep rise in international money market activity.
Earnings from net interest and fees rose 12 per cent, to DKr5.29bn, and
there was a net valuation gain of DKr1.45bn on securities and other
financial instruments, compared with a DKr199m loss in the first half of
1992.
The profit from core banking activities was also up, rising by more than 50
per cent to DKr919m. Both the Danish and international branch networks
contributed to the improvements. Mr Knud Soensen, chief executive, described
this as encouraging, but not yet satisfactory considering Den Danske's
substantial equity capital.
Income from traditional deposit-taking and lending rose only modestly.
Operating expenses and depreciation were trimmed by 8 per cent, to
DKr3.27bn, as the staff reduction programme started last year gathered pace.
Bad debt provision was increased to DKr1.41bn from DKr1.04bn. The bank said
small- and medium-sized businesses were having a particularly difficult
time, although personal customers were doing a little better.
Mr Soensen warned of lower profits in the current half, anticipating less
activity on the money markets. Expenses were also likely to rise.
He said group profits would be particularly affected by the levels of bond
and share prices at the end of year.
