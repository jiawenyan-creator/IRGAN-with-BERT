<DOCTITLE>Cerebral Palsy Prevention Research Workgroup_Public Meeting</DOCTITLE>


The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), announces
the following meeting.





Name: 

Cerebral Palsy Prevention Research Workgroup_Public Meeting.


Time and date: 

8:30 a.m.4 p.m., December 12, 1994.


Place: 

CDC, Auditorium B, 1600 Clifton Road, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30333.


Status: 

Open to invited scientists with expertise in the prevention and amelioration of Cerebral Palsy, others interested
in Cerebral Palsy prevention and research, and the general public.


Purpose: 

Cerebral Palsy is a non-progressive multihandicapping condition caused by organic brain damage before, during,
or soon after birth. Cerebral Palsy has a prevalence rate of about 3/1,000 births in the United States. Researchers
believe that the etiology of Cerebral Palsy is associated with numerous perinatal factors, such as maternal infections,
physical trauma, premature birth, very low birthweight, anoxia, hemorrhaging, malnutrition of the mother, poor
prenatal and postnatal care, and environmental hazards during pregnancy. Although Cerebral Palsy has no cure, CDC
is actively seeking preventive measures based on population prevalence and epidemiologic risk factors associated
with Cerebral Palsy.


Matters to be discussed: 

At the meeting, CDC will provide a forum for scientific discussion of the state of prevention of Cerebral Palsy based
on current scientific data.
