FT  26 OCT 94 / People: Departures
Robert Maxted is on the lookout for a new company following his decision to
step down from the board of Pillar, the property investment company he built
during the early 1990s and which was floated earlier this year.
Maxted's departure follows the arrival in the summer of Raymond Mould and
Patrick Vaughan, the high-profile duo who led the buy-out of Arlington
Securities from British Aerospace in 1989 and who are now chairman and chief
executive of Pillar.
Maxted stepped aside to become property director, but having been in the
chief executive's shoes since the company's formation in 1991 found the new
role too constricting.
Maxted has a long history in the property business. In 1987 he sold his
private company Mount Row to Speyhawk, the developer which went into
receivership last May.
However, he left Speyhawk three years before its collapse and set up Pillar,
which was originally conceived as a vulture fund picking up
institutional-quality assets as the property market crumbled.
'I'm looking for another vehicle, preferably in the public sector,' comments
Maxted. 'I want to be more of my own boss again.'
