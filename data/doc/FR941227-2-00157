SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for the Lake Tahoe
Airport, effective November 14, 1994.



Under Section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure map, may submit to the FAA, a noise compatibility
program which sets for the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing noncompatible
land uses and prevention of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps.
The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local
communities, government agencies, airport users and FAA personnel.

Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part
150 is a local program not a federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR Part 150
program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Act and is limited to
the following determinations:
