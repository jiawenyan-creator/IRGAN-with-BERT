  [Text] San Salvador, 28 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- An official source 
reported that the Central American Integration System (SICA) 
today hoisted its flag along with those of other regional 
countries at the border areas. A spokesman for the regional 
organization said these ceremonies were attended by high-ranking 
officials of each Central American foreign ministry. 
  The SICA flag-raising ceremony "reflects an integration 
process that is actually becoming a reality and also reflects a 
respect for rapprochement among people," the spokesman said. The 
"Central American flag," which is the symbol of regional 
integration, features the SICA emblem, which is a map of the 
isthmus and four spheres extolling the integral development 
being sought in the region. 
  SICA was created when the "Tegucigalpa Protocol" was signed 
in the Honduran capital in December 1991. It represents the 
region before the international community. This organization was 
officially established 1 February 1993 in San Salvador.
