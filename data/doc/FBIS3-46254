  [Text] Individual civil servants should not be the target 
of attacks in the row between China and Britain, the Deputy to 
the Governor, Anson Chan Fang On-sang, said. 
  Mrs Chan was responding to comments by the Director of the 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping. 
  Mr Lu questioned the legitimacy of the Secretary for 
Constitutional Affairs, Michael Sze Chocheung, to represent the 
people of Hong Kong at the British Foreign Affairs Select 
Committee (FAC) meeting. 
  Noting that Mr Sze had been asked to represent Hong Kong 
people at the FAC meeting, Mr Lu said: "How many people in Hong 
Kong regard this `faithful' follower (of Governor Chris Patten) 
as a Hong Kong `person'?" Responding to the comments, Mrs Chan 
said: "I very much hope that both sides could deal with matters 
(of substance) instead of targeting the individuals."
