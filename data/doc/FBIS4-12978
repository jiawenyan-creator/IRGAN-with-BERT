to the president. [passage omitted] 
  Yahya al-'Arashi made the following statement after the 
meeting: 
  [Begin al-'Arashi recording] I was honored to meet his 
excellency President Zine El Abidine. I delivered a letter from 
his brother General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the 
Presidential Council of the Republic of Yemen. 
  This was an appropriate occasion to inform the president of 
developments in Yemen, which is going through a passing crisis, 
God willing, and the national efforts being currently made at 
the level of dialogues in order to emerge from the crisis. We 
appreciate every effort, including Maghreban efforts that were 
demonstrated in the Tunis conference and the efforts made by 
President Zine El Abidine to support the Yemeni cause. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]
