  [Text] [Announcer] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman 
returned from Albania this evening. At Zagreb Pleso airport the 
president was welcomed by Stipe Mesic, Josip Manolic, Nikica 
Valentic, Janko Bobetko, Gojko Susak, Jure Radic, and other top 
state officials. Following his arrival at the airport Tudjman 
told journalists that the talks he held in Tirana were useful 
for the political and economic development of Croatia and 
Albania. Commenting on a meeting between Foreign Minister 
Granic and Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in Washington, 
President Tudjman said: 
  [Begin recording] [Tudjman] I think that this is a success 
both for our policy and this time also for international policy, 
the European and U.S. ones. This is a success that is leading 
toward peace, which is most important, while it is opening up 
possibilities to Croatia for the resolution of all its problems, 
primarily the speedier resolution of problems regarding Croatian 
territories under UN protection -- in other words, under Serb 
occupation -- and the resolution of all other economic and 
financial problems, which is very important. [end recording]
