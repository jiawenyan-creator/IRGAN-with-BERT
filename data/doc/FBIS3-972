  [Text] Harare Mar 16 SAPA -- Zimbabwe's Agriculture 
Minister Kumbirai Kangai on Wednesday [16 March] insisted there 
was "nothing wrong" with government action in seizing 
white-owned farms and then leasing them to cabinet ministers, 
MPs and civil servants. 
  Mr Kangai said it was part of government policy to "develop 
indigenous commercial farmers". 
  The minister also confirmed reports that the first farm to 
be 
seized in terms of the controversial Land Acquisition Act was 
initially intended for 33 peasant farmers from an overcrowded 
neighbouring communal land but was instead leased to Minister of 
Education Witness Mangwende. 
  The law allows the government to force white farmers to sell 
their land and denies them the right to sue for unfair 
compensation. 
  Mr Mangwende was the agriculture minister two years ago who 
bulldozed the policy into law, leading President Robert Mugabe's 
"revolutionary" land policy to correct imbalances in land 
distribution. 
  Some 4,000 white farmers own 11 million hectares of land. 
  Mr Kangai who faced the press on the scandal for the first 
time on Wednesday, said the government's resettlement policy was 
"very clear" in securing land not only for peasants, but also 
for people who happened to be senior government officials. 
  The government was in the process of "addressing the 
disparity of the position, and developing the indigenous 
commercial farmer", Mr Kangai said. "Mangwende happened to be 
an individual who had an application on our file," he said. 
  "For that farm, for the people who applied, he was the most 
suitable. There is nothing wrong with that," he added. 
  Mr Kangai insisted Mr Mangwende had met "the right 
criteria". 
  When charged that a similar case in Britain would have 
resulted in the responsible cabinet minister being fired, Mr 
Kangai replied, "I am glad I am not in the UK".
