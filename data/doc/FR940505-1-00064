 



As an alternative to the fees or restrictions on 
recreational boating, EPA requests comment on obtaining the 
additional VOC reductions from stationary sources. This 
alternative would consist of either increasing the cap reduction 
requirement or achieving further VOC reductions from sources 
which are not covered by the cap regulations (e.g., architectural 
coatings, consumer products). 
e. 

EPA's preferred option_

(1) EPA authority to initiate bump-up. Under section 181(b)(3) of the Act, EPA must grant the 
request of a state to reclassify a nonattainment area to a higher 
classification. Once the area has been bumped-up pursuant to 
such a request, it becomes subject to the more stringent control 
requirements associated with the higher classification. While a 
state need not make any particular showing for the bump-up 
request to be granted, legislative history indicates that the 
voluntary bump-up ``is provided for areas that wish to impose the 
more stringent control measures associated with a higher 
classification or that, for reasons such as extremely rapid 
population growth, conclude that they will not be able to attain 
by their otherwise applicable date [sic].'' H.R. Rep. No. 101490, Part 1, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 232 (1990).

In the case of the Sacramento nonattainment area, the State 
could mitigate the difficulties in achieving attainment by 1999 
by requesting a voluntary reclassification from ``Serious'' to 
``Severe,'' which would allow up to an additional six years to 
attain the ozone NAAQS. To date, the State has not opted to do 
so for the purposes of its attainment SIP, which must be 
submitted to EPA in November 1994. See section 182(c)(2) and 
(d). EPA, however, must confront these same difficulties now in 
designing its FIP proposal and, in the absence of a State 
request, must determine whether the Agency may avail itself of 
the voluntary bump-up option. 
While the Act specifically provides for an EPA-initiated 
reclassification only upon failure of an area to attain the ozone 
NAAQS by the applicable attainment date, the Agency believes that 
a recent Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case offers a persuasive 
basis for interpreting the Act as authority for a unilateral 
bump-up in the FIP context. 


Central Arizona Water Conservation District et al. 

v. 

EPA, 


990 F.2d 1531 (9th Cir. 1993), involved EPA promulgation of a 
visibility FIP to remedy visibility impairment in the Grand 
Canyon National Park. In that case, the court upheld EPA's 
action under regulations that on their face applied only to state 
action in adopting a SIP. The court stated that when ``[a]cting 
in the place of the state *** pursuant to a FIP under 42 U.S.C. 
7410(c), EPA `stands in the shoes of the defaulting State, and 
all of the rights and duties that would otherwise fall to the 
State accrue instead to EPA.''' 990 F.2d at 1541. Based on this 
decision, EPA has concluded that when the Agency promulgates a 
FIP, it can stand in the shoes of the state in order to bump up 
an ozone nonattainment area under section 181(b)(3) on its own 
initiative. 
(2) Rationale for bump-up to ``Severe.'' Although the design value assigned to Sacramento for the 
period 1988 through 1990 resulted in its classification as 
``Serious,'' a review of the most recent design values and yearly 
exceedances for several ozone areas including Sacramento 
(summarized in the following table) show that it is comparable to 
other ``Severe'' nonattainment areas with the 4th highest design 
value in the group and the 7th highest number of yearly 
exceedances.

data. Design values and exceedance numbers are for 
19901992 and derive from

Emissions Trends Report, 1992

 (November 2, 1993).

The urban airshed modeling which calculates the reductions needed 
to attain the standards also produces results comparable to the 
percent reduction needed for attainment in Ventura (an area 
classified as ``Severe'' under the Act). The VOC reduction target 
is identical at 40 percent; the NO

X

 target is somewhat lower at 
30 percent (compared to 40 percent). 



However, the main reason EPA believes a bump-up to 2005 for 
the Sacramento area is appropriate is the difficulty in achieving 
significant emissions reductions from a mobile source dominated 
emissions inventory where less than 10 percent of the NO

X

 
emissions are from stationary sources. A 1999 attainment date 
does not allow sufficient time for the emissions reductions of 
many of the mobile source strategies discussed in section III.D 
to occur. This includes strategies which rely on the normal 
replacement of older, dirtier engines and vehicles with cleaner 
engines and vehicles. It also would include strategies that rely 
on longer lead times to develop and implement lower emitting 
operational improvements or control hardware. Thus, EPA must 
turn to measures which require retrofits or replacements for in-use engines and vehicles, and restrictions on mobile
source 
activity to achieve the necessary emissions reductions. A bump-up would allow the Sacramento area to take advantage
of the new 
engine standards and other requirements proposed in section 
III.D, and avoid accelerating turnover for heavy duty truck 
engines, capping nonroad engine emissions growth and restricting 
driving_measures EPA is proposing to satisfy the 1999 attainment 
demonstration.
