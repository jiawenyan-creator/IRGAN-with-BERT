  [Text] [News Service] -- With the closure of nearly 840 km 
of eastern borders of the country to smugglers, the roads to the 
passage of narcotics convoys through the borders into the 
country was closed. 
  According to a report by the Central News Unit, referring to 
the above statement, Mr. Besharati said: The work on closing the 
borders in the vulnerable areas began four months ago, and these 
operations were completed with the digging of a canal 4 meters 
high and wide, the installation of numerous watch towers, and 
putting mines on the path of narcotics convoys. At the present 
time, these convoys cannot enter the country. 
  Concerning the recent riot in Zahedan instigated by 
narcotics 
smugglers, referring to the march of the Muslim and 
revolutionary people of Zahedan in condemning this action by 
rioters, the minister of interior added: The Shi'ite and Sunni 
brothers and sisters with their march against the narcotics 
smugglers once again declared their support for the Islamic 
revolution, the grand leader, and the president and put an end 
to all the rumors spread by internal and foreign enemies.
