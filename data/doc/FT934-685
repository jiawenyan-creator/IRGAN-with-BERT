FT  23 DEC 93 / Observer: US manoeuvres
Despite his departure as US defence secretary, Les Aspin's finger is still
hovering over the button. Which diplomatic plum will he collect as his
consolation prize?
According to the semi-official word from chief of staff Mack McLarty, Aspin
can choose between the US embassies in Beijing or Moscow. Theoretically,
Beijing's incumbent, Stapleton Roy, would then be free to take over the
vacant job of deputy secretary of state. On the other hand, if Aspin fancies
Moscow, that would release Tom Pickering, the senior career diplomat, to be
number two in Foggy Bottom.
However, Aspen may not have the field to himself. The name of Vernon Jordan,
the civil rights lawyer, golfing pal of the president and all round fixer is
being discreetly mentioned - his presence on the presidential flight to
Moscow next month could be significant.
