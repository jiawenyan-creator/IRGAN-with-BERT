FT  06 SEP 93 / People: Rhodes switches to Thorn lights
Thorn Lighting Group has lost little time in making fresh main board
appointments following its sale to Investcorp, the Bahrain-based investment
bank, which in June this year paid Pounds 162m to Thorn EMI in what was
effectively a management buy-out. According to Investcorp, Thorn Lighting
will be seeking a flotation in the medium term.
Phillip Rhodes (right), a 46-year-old chartered accountant, has joined as
chief executive covering the UK, Ireland and central European territories;
Michael Frye, 47, chief executive of the engineering and machine tool
manufacturer B. Elliott, becomes a non-executive director with special
responsibility for Thorn Lighting's architectural lighting initiative and
design issues.
They join a main board of seven, and also a management executive board of
nine.
Rhodes was a main board director of the commercial support services group
BET between 1989-92, overseeing (as divisional chairman) the group's textile
rental, contract catering and facilities management in the UK, US and
Europe. Before that he held various posts with Guinness.
'There are lots of similarities in the marketing mix', of both Guinness and
Thorn, says Rhodes, a believer in general management 'being a universally
applicable skill'. Thus although there might seem to be a substantial leap
from spirits to lights and 'our customers are not consumers in the same way,
we nevertheless have to serve them efficiently and well'.
As happened with its sale of Kenwood Appliances and Thorn EMI Software to
their managements, Thorn EMI retains a stake in the new Thorn Lighting
company. The parent company receives Pounds 137m in cash, a 12 per cent
equity stake, worth Pounds 8.7m, and Pounds 16.3m in subordinated loan
notes.
