FT  02 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher weaker
Retailing conglomerate Kingfisher suffered a volatile day's trading, ending
the session sharply lower as a cautious agm statement was compounded by
renewed worries over a potentially acute stock overhang.
Dealers said the fear that some shareholders in Darty, the French electrical
retailer bought by Kingfisher last year, might exercise their option from
tomorrow to sell some 20m Kingfisher shares had hit the stock in afternoon
trading. 'No one wants to chase the stock if a few million shares are about
to come into the market,' commented one seasoned trader.
Having started the session weak, Kingfisher shares rallied as the agm
unfolded, with the market cheered by positive news on gross margins.
However, subsequent revelations over sluggish sales growth and cautious
comments from the chairman renewed the pressure and the shares continued to
slide. They eventually closed 21 down at 522p after 2.3m traded.
