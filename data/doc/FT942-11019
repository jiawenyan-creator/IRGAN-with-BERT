FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Yates Bros Wine Lodges lines up summer
flotation
Yates Brothers Wine Lodges, the independent northern-based drinks group
whose Blackpool outlet is a favourite watering hole for politicians and
journalists at conference time, is planning a full listing this summer.
The group was founded in 1884 by Mr Peter Yates, who was fired by a
philanthropic desire to sell quality wine at reasonable prices to the
northern working man.
Mr Peter Dickson, his great-grandson and the group's current managing
director, said the founder built the business quickly by the simple
expedient of cutting out the middle men. In the mid-1980s Mr Dickson started
to rationalise and expand the group, raising money by coming to the market
under the matched bargain Rule 535. About 75 per cent of the shares are
currently in family hands.
Last December Yates reported a 13 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds
1.41m for the six months to September 26, on turnover 34 per cent ahead at
Pounds 22m. It reported buoyant sales across retail and wholesale
activities. Full-year results are expected in early June.
Yates's Wine Lodges, the main subsidiary, has 46 outlets concentrated in the
north of England. Group policy is to concentrate on town and city centres,
with ground floor retail space of between 2,000 and 2,500 sq ft.
Mr Dickson said the group had a market capitalisation of Pounds 47m. The
flotation would aim to raise new money while leaving the family in control.
On Thursday the group opened in Leigh, Lancashire, the first outlet of
Watling Street Inns - a joint venture company launched last year with Mr
Steven Kalton, of Kalton Inns and Leisure, another northern company. Yates
owns 75 per cent of the venture, which is aiming at a more family-orientated
market outside town and city centres.
The group also has a wholesale business, and is supplier of drinks to more
than 30 airlines. Its sponsor is Panmure Gordon.
