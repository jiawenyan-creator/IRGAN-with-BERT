FT  21 JUN 93 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading for Heathrow's Terminal 3
A Pounds 15.5m package of new contracts has been placed with TEAM SERVICES,
based in London. They include the refurbishment of 26 gate lounges, six
coach gates and three passenger piers for BAA at Heathrow's Terminal 3.
Team tendered successfully for the design and build project after first
being appointed to provide construction consultancy services. Work is to be
phased over 20 months enabling the airport to carry on normally.
Team is also involved in projects in Wales. At the University of Wales
College of Cardiff 502 residential accommodation units are being provided
for students with another 207 en suite rooms at Gwent College of Higher
Education.
Both projects, at a total cost of Pounds 8.7m, must be completed in time for
the next student intake.
Also in Wales, the company is to undertake the design and manage the
construction of a 35,000 sq ft extension and a car park at South Wales
Electricity's headquarters in Cardiff. This is the second of two, similar
projects.
