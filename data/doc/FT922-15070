FT  03 APR 92 / Air passengers down 6.5% last year
THE NUMBER of UK airline passengers fell 6.5 per cent last year to 98.5m
compared with 1990, reflecting the combined effects of the Gulf War, the
Yugoslav crisis and the recession, according to UK airport statistics
published yesterday by the Civil Aviation Authority.
It was the third decline in UK passenger numbers in the past 25 years. They
fell by 7.4 per cent in 1974 and by 0.1 per cent in 1981.
The overall number of UK air transport takeoffs and landings fell 3.9 per
cent last year after increasing 3.3 per cent in 1990. It was the largest
decline recorded in the past 25 years.
The CAA figures show that scheduled airline services from the UK to
continental Europe suffered worst from the setback in air travel, falling by
8.5 per cent last year. Charter services fell by 2.1 per cent. Air traffic,
however, has shown signs of a steady recovery since the beginning of this
year. Airline traffic in Europe continued to recover last month, according
to figures released yesterday by the Association of European Airlines.
The AEA, which groups 23 European airlines, said traffic lost during the
height of the Gulf crisis had been recouped.
The International Air Transport Association (Iata), which groups more than
200 airlines, said worldwide traffic continued to recover last month.
International passenger traffic increased 46 per cent in February compared
with the same month last year.
Mr Gunter Eser, IATA's director, emphasised that 'when looking at the
spectacular passenger-traffic growth rate for February, we must remember
that traffic in February 1991 was nearly 25 per cent less than in February
1990'.
