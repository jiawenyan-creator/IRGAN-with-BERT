FT  17 MAY 93 / London 'leads in world lending'
THE Bank of England says in its quarterly bulletin that London remains the
leading centre for international bank lending, ahead of Japan.
British banks accounted for a considerable share of the growth in
international bank business in London last year, but the strongest growth
was generated by other EC banks, particularly French and German. Japanese
banks' business in London continued to decline.
The Bank suggests that borrowing in international banking and capital
markets will be boosted this year by substantial refinancing needs as debt
issued in the late 1980s matures and demand for funds from the public sector
continues.
The impact of these factors is already evident this year, with international
bond issues reaching a record, it says.
The Bank says that borrowing in the international banking and capital
markets more than doubled last year after falling sharply in 1991. But
because a large part of the borrowing refinanced existing debt, net
borrowing was broadly the same as in 1991.
Political uncertainties in Europe in the second half of the year, along with
volatility on exchange and interest rates, prompted investors to shift from
the Ecu and high-yielding European currencies to 'safe havens' such as the
dollar and the D-Mark, the bulletin says.
In the first six months of last year, when Europe appeared to be heading
towards economic and monetary union, investors bought high-yield European
bonds in the belief that convergence of European inflation and interest
rates would provide capital gains.
Sentiment switched after Denmark rejected the Maastricht treaty and
realignments of European exchange rate mechanism currencies showed that
'exchange rates within the ERM were not immutably fixed'.
