  [Text] The battle for the Rwandan capital, Kigali, 
continued overnight and today. The RPF [Rwandan Patriotic 
Front] rebels went back to war against government forces 
following the atrocities in Kigali after the death of President 
Habyarimana in a plane clash last week. The RPF apparently 
mounted a (?pincer) movement around the capital, and there have 
reports of fighting in the south of the city. Well, today the 
United Nations brokered a meeting between the RPF and the 
government to discuss the possibilities of a cease-fire. Our 
correspondent Mark Doyle is in Kigali. Aba Saleh asked him what 
was the outcome: 
  [Begin recording] [Doyle] Well, senior civilian United 
Nations official said that a cease-fire had not been signed and 
that there was no cease-fire. However, that they thought it was 
very positive that this first meeting had taken place and it 
does seem that this is the.... [pauses] Even though a cease-fire 
was not signed, the fact that the two parties could get together 
is the best news we have had for a week, although, of course, 
without a cease- fire the fighting could continue and there are 
still a great many extremely serious issues to address. 
  [Saleh] You say they said that it was good news that the two 
parties could get together. Now, can you tell us something 
about the logistics of the meeting? Where was it held and how 
did they arrive? 
  [Doyle] It was held at the Meridien Hotel, which is in the 
central-north of Kigali. It was the result of intensive efforts 
by General Dallaire, the UN commander and, no doubt, his other 
liaison officers, who worked with the RPF and the government 
side. They arrived at the hotel which was guarded, and on the 
roof were Tunisian soldiers with some very fierce-looking 
weapons. There were a lot of Senegalese involved as well, and 
20 Ghanaians and the others who were guarding the hotel, and 
some Bangladeshis. The Bangladeshis, in fact, drove the two 
sides to the meeting in large white armored personnel carriers 
which are made of very thick metal. Those small arms can't 
pierce the shell. And then they left in the same vehicles, back 
to their respective armed camps. 
  [Saleh] And no indication yet of what the points of 
disagreement were? 
  [Doyle] No, I'm afraid I can't give you any details of what 
actually took place inside. None of the participants said 
anything substantial as they dashed out of the lobby of the 
hotel and into these big white vehicles driven by the 
Bangladeshis. 
  [Saleh] And would you say that the RPF is negotiting from a 
position of strength? Does it hold much of the country or many 
positions in the capital? 
  [Doyle] It holds some positions in the capital, in the 
north, 
and in the center, and the Rwandan Army is [words indistinct] 
resisting, holds also some very important parts, including the 
embassy area. All the embassies are abandoned now... [pauses] 
the main Army camp. They appear also to hold important 
positions around the strategically very important airport in the 
northeast of the city. And so both sides hold important areas. 
  [Saleh] And has there been much fighting today? 
  [Doyle] Not compared with three or four days ago, when it 
was 
very heavy. There have been some sporadic exchanges of mortar 
and small arms and machinegun fire, anti-aircraft guns not used 
against aircraft [words indistinct], and the point I 
heard....[pauses] What I saw was a multiple rocket launcher, and 
United Nations officials couldn't confirm that, although they 
don't know all the weapons that are in the town. The town is 
awash with weapons. This fighting was relatively sporadic, and 
they may well [words indistinct] been in certain circumstances 
the activities of bandits rather than direct military clashes.
