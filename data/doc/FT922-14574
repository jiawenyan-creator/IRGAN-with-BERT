FT  06 APR 92 / International Company News: Sitac and TI India buy Muddy Fox
out of receivership
MUDDY FOX, the UK maker of mountain bikes which is privately-owned, has been
bought out of administrative receivership by Sitac, a UK-based engineering
and property group, and TI Cycles of India for an undisclosed but
substantial amount.
The sale comes less than a month after Touche Ross, the accountants, were
appointed as administrative receivers following unspecified financial
difficulties at the Wembley-based company.
Yesterday Mr Nick Lyle, partner at Touche Ross and administrative receiver
responsible for the sale, said: 'Muddy Fox is a classic example of how a
basically sound company can be preserved despite receivership.'
Sitac and TI Cycles, which is 24 per cent owned by TI Group, the specialist
UK engineering company, are buying the assets, trademark and intellectual
property of Muddy Fox for what is understood to be 'close to a seven-figure
sum.' Turnover last year was Pounds 8.5m.
TI Cycles is one of India's biggest bicycle and engineering groups, but
Muddy Fox bikes will continue to be developed and designed in the UK and
produced at the company's existing manufacturing sources in the Far East.
The administrative receivership of Muddy Fox prompted around 200 inquiries
from potential purchasers, and the UK/Indian combination won through from a
shortlist of six.
The new owners said they were looking forward to supplying and supporting
the existing network of UK and European customers.
They are also formulating plans for developing the business and are looking
to appoint distributors in the UK and Germany, and to develop opportunities
in the UK, Europe, North America and Australasia.
