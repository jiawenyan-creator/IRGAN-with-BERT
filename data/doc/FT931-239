FT  31 MAR 93 / Mayflower to put Pounds 24m into MG sports car
MAYFLOWER, the specialist UK engineering company, is planning to invest up
to Pounds 24.2m in its collaborative venture with Rover to develop and
produce a new range of MG sports cars.
Both Rover, the motor vehicle subsidiary of British Aerospace, and Mayflower
refused officially to confirm the project yesterday.
But Mayflower admitted that it was 'at an advanced stage of negotiation' for
a significant contract for the design, development and supply of the
bodyshell for 'a new specialist vehicle for European markets'.
Rover said that it had not yet made a 'final' decision about the development
of a new MG, but it conceded that 'our studies have been extended by
investigating possible relationships which might be relevant'.
It is understood that a final decision will be taken shortly on the project,
code-named PR3, which is aimed at resurrecting the world-famous MG sports
car marque by launching a small, affordable, volume-produced roadster in
1995.
Mayflower said that it would invest up to Pounds 24.2m in the initial
engineering design, development and tooling work, including the
establishment of the necessary production facilities for the 'new specialist
vehicle'.
Production of the bodyshells was expected to start in the early part of
1995, it said, and was planned to reach a level 'in excess' of 10,000 a year
at full production with an annual sales value of around Pounds 20m. The
initial contract was expected to be for six years.
It is understood that output of the new MG is being planned to reach 15,000
to 20,000 a year.
The car is expected to be mid-engined and is likely to be powered at the top
end of the range by Rover's K-Series engine in a new 1.6-litre version,
which is currently under development.
