  [Text] [words indistinct] today Thursday during student 
disturbances that took place a short distance from the 
Miraflores presidential building. 
  German Sotillo, a 16-year-old student, died after he was 
shot 
three times. According to students and professors of the Fermin 
Toro Secondary School, Sotillo was shot by a police officer who 
was riding on a water cannon that was being used to disperse the 
demonstrators. 
  The students were protesting against bus drivers who have 
been ignoring their right to preferential fares. The bus 
drivers, meanwhile, argue that since last year the government 
has failed to adequately subsidize the students' reduced fares. 
  [In a related 210-word, Caracas-datelined report, Madrid EFE 
in Spanish at 1550 GMT on 5 May quotes a police source saying, 
"the student was shot by unidentified individuals from a passing 
vehicle." Two other students also were reported to have been 
wounded by gunfire. After Sotillo was shot and killed, students 
threw rocks at police, who responded by firing tear gas grenades 
into the crowd to disperse the demonstrators.]
