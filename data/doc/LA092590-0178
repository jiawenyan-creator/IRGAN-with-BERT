P.M. BRIEFING; 
CRACKS FOUND INSIDE JET ENGINES 
Pratt &amp; Whitney, a major manufacturer of jet engines, has advised customers 
of cracks found inside the main turbine shafts of 12 of its newest engines, a 
company spokesman said today. 
The problem was considered serious enough to advise all customers and the 
Federal Aviation Administration when it was discovered earlier this month by 
the company, Pratt &amp; Whitney spokesman Mark Sullivan said. 
Sullivan said emergency inspections have turned up cracks in only 12 of the 174 
PW4000 engines delivered to aircraft builders and air carriers so far. The 
engines are designed to power wide-body airliners.
