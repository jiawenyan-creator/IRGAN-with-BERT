  [Text] Moscow, June 26 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin returned to Moscow Saturday [25 June] night from Greece, 
where he signed a "historic" agreement on partnership and 
cooperation with the European Union (EU). 
  The Russian president left Moscow for Greece on Thursday 
morning to take part in the meeting of the heads of state and 
government of the member countries of the EU held on the island 
of Corfu. 
  He signed the agreement on Friday and described it as a 
"historic document." 
  The 80-page document is expected to boost trade and

the conditions and stages of Russia's return to the economic 
Europe as an equal partner," said Yeltsin.

building a united Europe. 
  On Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev signed 
a Partnership for Peace program in Brussels with the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
