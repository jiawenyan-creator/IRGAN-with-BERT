Reached $6.6 Billion"] 
  [Excerpt] Prague -- The development of foreign currency 
reserves in the banking system shows a similar tempo as in the 
most dynamic periods last year. This follows from information 
provided to HOSPODARSKE NOVINY by Ondrej Kvacek from the Czech 
National Bank's Press Department. In January, the level of 
foreign currency reserves in the banking system rose from $6.2 
billion to $6.5 billion. The National Bank's foreign currency 
reserves rose from $4.1 billion to $3.8 billion at the end of 
1993. In the commercial banks, it remained at $2.4 billion.
