FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: MCI Communications up 17%
MCI Communications, the second-largest US long-distance telecommunications
carrier, yesterday reported a 17 per cent increase in fourth-quarter
earnings amid strong revenue and traffic growth.
The company reported earnings of Dollars 160m, or 60 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 137m, or 52 cents, in the same period of last year. Revenues
rose 13 per cent to Dollars 2.76bn from Dollars 2.44bn, while traffic was up
14 per cent.
For the full year, MCI reported earnings of Dollars 589m, or Dollars 2.21 a
share, against Dollars 522m, or Dollars 2.01, in 1991, while revenues were
Dollars 10.56bn, up 11 per cent compared with 1991's Dollars 9.49bn.
The fourth-quarter figures included revenue, less expenses, of Dollars 56m
from a previously-announced intelligent network licensing agreement with
Stentor of Canada. The company recorded one-time costs of Dollars 47m due to
a business reorganisation announced last year.
Mr Daniel Akerson, president, said factors contributing to the 25-year-old
company's first year with revenues over Dollars 10bn included its Friends
and Family programme - an innovative scheme which cuts the price of
residential calls and now has more than 10m customers  - as well as major
contracts reached with clients such as the Federal Aviation Authority.
The company said that in 1993 in would focus on developing its 800 toll-free
services, expansion of its data products, extending its international reach
and developing new technologies such as personal communications services.
