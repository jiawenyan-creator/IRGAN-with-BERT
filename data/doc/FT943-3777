FT  13 SEP 94 / Poor showing by FDP worries Kohl
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, yesterday warned his governing
Christian Democratic Union coalition not to become complacent in the run-up
to the federal elections on October 16. 'The election is not yet won and we
have no votes to lend,' he said.
Mr Kohl was speaking in Bonn after provisional election results showed
another absolute and increased majority for the CDU in the eastern German
state of Saxony. Its share of the vote rose from 53.8 per cent to 58.1 per
cent while that of the opposition Social Democrats fell by nearly three
percentage points to 16.6 per cent.
However, the CDU in Brandenburg had its share of the vote reduced by nearly
11 percentage points to 18.7 per cent, while the vote for the Social
Democrats rose from 38.2 per cent to 54.1 per cent.
Mr Kohl's warning was prompted by the disastrous showing of the Free
Democrats, the junior partner in the governing coalition, which failed to
reach the minimum 5 per cent required to enter the state parliaments.
Mr Werner Hoyer, chairman of the FDP, said the results in Brandenburg and
Saxony were 'untypical. The FDP believes the low turnouts of under 60 per
cent damaged the party but helped the Party of Democratic Socialism, the
successor to the former east German communist party and now the third
largest party in eastern Germany, holding between 16 and 18 per cent of the
vote in Brandenburg and Saxony.
