MORNING REPORT: MUSIC 
A Royal Song: Prince Charles gave the Queen Mother a special 90th birthday 
present Thursday -- a concert of specially commissioned music. 
The concert by the English Chamber Orchestra, and a recording to be released by 
EMI, will benefit Charles' charity, the Prince's Trust, which helps 
disadvantaged young people. Charles commissioned one of the works by composer 
Patrick Doyle especially for his grandmother. The piece has a series of 
Scottish verses set to music, and was sung by Scottish soprano Marie 
McLaughlin. GREG BRAXTON
