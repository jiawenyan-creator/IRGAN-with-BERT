FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Caverdale expands to Pounds 1.3m
Caverdale Group, the motor retailing and industrial products concern, nearly
doubled pre-tax profits, from Pounds 663,000 to Pounds 1.28m, in the six
months to June 30.
Turnover advanced from Pounds 21.6m to Pounds 48.3m of which acquisitions
accounted for Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 7.86m).
The industrial products division had a strong six months, and Mr Arild
Nerdrum, chairman, said he believed the outlook for the retail motor
industry was more positive than at any time since Caverdale entered the
sector. He expected further substantial growth in the second half.
The group completed the Godfrey Davis acquisition yesterday and Mr Nerdrum
said the acquisition, which marks Caverdale's first involvement with Ford,
would add about Pounds 70m to turnover in a full year.
An interim dividend of 0.1p is being paid from earnings per share of 0.55p
(0.46p).
