SERIES CARRIED 'INACCURATE' TITLE 
I have read several of the "End of Nature" series by Bill McKibben (Nov. 23-26) 
and agree that it says valuable things and says them well. 
However, I have to deplore McKibben's decision to saddle it with that alarmist 
and inaccurate title. The meaning of McKibben's analysis is not that nature is 
ending, but that nature is taking its natural course and correcting in its 
ponderous and amoral way the temporary imbalances brought about by man's 
irreverent and heedless misuse of the planet during the last few centuries. 
Nature, I assure you, will not come out second best in a head-to-head showdown 
between nature and mankind. A few dozen (or hundred) species may become extinct 
somewhat sooner than the natural order would dictate; Homo sapiens may well be 
among them. 
Natural processes will eliminate (or minimize) the human irritant and the Earth 
will set about to compensate for man's meddling. McKibben's series might better 
be titled "The End of Civilization."
