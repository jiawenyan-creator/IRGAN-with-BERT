IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
EARLY OVARIAN CANCER CARE URGED 
Women with early ovarian cancer who receive expert care have a much better 
chance of surviving than previously thought, the largest study of the disease 
so far has concluded. 
Ovarian cancer patients whose tumor is found early apparently can also avoid 
chemotherapy after surgical removal of their tumors without reducing their 
chances of survival, the study found. 
The results "finally give us the handle that we've needed in treating early 
stage ovarian cancer," said Dr. Harrison Ball of New England Medical Center in 
Boston, who participated in the research. Previously there was no standard 
approach, Ball said. 
In the new study, among those women whose cancer had not spread beyond the 
ovaries and who underwent meticulous medical evaluation, the five-year survival 
rate exceeded 90%. 
Previously published survival rates for such patients ranged between 50% and 
70%.
