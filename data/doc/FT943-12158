FT  27 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: German consumer prices rise
Consumer prices in the west German state of Hesse rose 0.1 per cent in the
month to mid-July for a year-on-year increase of 3 per cent, the state
statistics office said. Baden-Wurttemberg reported that consumer prices were
flat in July compared with June and up 3 per cent from a year earlier. North
Rhine-Westphalia reported month-on-month inflation at 0.1 per cent, with the
year-on-year figure up 2.7 per cent. These regional figures support
forecasts that annual inflation in western Germany will drop below 3 per
cent in July for the first time since April 1991.
Ukraine's industrial output was down 36 per cent in the first six months
compared to the same period last year, but the downward trend has slowed
since May, the statistics ministry said. The decline was largest in oil
refining, chemicals, machinery, metal manufacturing and construction
materials.
