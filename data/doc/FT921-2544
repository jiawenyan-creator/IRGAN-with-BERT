FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Labour focuses on Scottish
parliament
THE setting up of a Scottish parliament within 22 months of the election of
a Labour government is the centrepiece of the party's Scottish manifesto,
launched by Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, in Edinburgh
yesterday, James Buxton writes.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, said the Scottish parliament
would be able to legislate for local government, health, housing, transport
and the environment, and would have powers over industrial development.
It would also have the power to 'adjust basic rates of income tax'. Labour
has said in the past that the discretion would be limited to 3p up or down.
The manifesto confirmed that the Scottish parliament would be elected by the
additional-member system of proportional representation. Labour officials
say they envisage an assembly of little more than 100 members, with one
member for each of the existing 72 Scottish constituencies topped up by
members elected from party lists.
Local government would be reduced to a single tier, with the number of local
authorities left up to the parliament.
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the development
bodies, would set up their own investment banking divisions, working with
Labour's National Investment Bank. A new body named Scottish Exports
International would promote Scottish products abroad.
