At the request of CARB, the changes to the contingency plan are being parallel processed in accordance with 40 CFR part
51, appendix V in order to expedite the approval of the redesignation request and maintenance plan. The BAAQMD, MTC
and ABAG held a public hearing on the new contingency plan on July 29, 1994. 
The contingency measures proposed by the BAAQMD meet the requirements of section 175A(d) of the Act. 


5E. Subsequent Maintenance Plan Revisions. 

In accordance with section 175A(b) of the Act, the State has agreed to submit a revised maintenance SIP eight years
after the area is redesignated to attainment. Such revised SIP will provide for maintenance for an additional ten
years (See letter dated April 15, 1994 from Milton Feldstein, BAAQMD to James Boyd, CARB attached to the TSD). 


IV. Potential Impact of California Federal Implementation Plans and State Implementation Plans 


EPA is under court order to promulgate final federal implementation plans (FIPs) for ozone for Los Angeles-South
Coast Air Basin Area, the Sacramento Metro Area, and the Ventura County Area and for carbon monoxide for Los Angeles-South
Coast Air Basin Area by February 15, 1995. EPA discusses the phenomenon of pollutant transport within air basins in
the proposed FIPs (59 FR 23393, May 5, 1994). EPA acknowledges that future modeling analyses could eventually result
in revisions to the FIP, which may impose additional FIP controls for areas not covered by the proposed FIPs, such as
the San Francisco Bay Area, which is upwind of Sacramento. EPA's proposed action to redesignate the San Francisco
Bay Area to an attainment area does not exclude the possibility of future FIP controls in the area. 
In addition, States are responsible for developing and submitting demonstrations which show that the standard will
be attained by the applicable date for areas where the demonstration of attainment is complicated by transport between
two areas of different classifications (See General Preamble to title I of the Clean Air Act (57 FR 13528, April 16,
1992)). Thus, EPA expects the ozone modeling demonstrations due by November 15, 1994 required by section 182(c)(2)
to address transport and to demonstrate attainment for all areas within California. 
A recent report released by CARB, ``Preliminary Assessment of Transport on San Joaquin Valley Ozone,'' discusses
recent simulations to assess the impact of transported emissions in the San Joaquin Valley. It should be noted that
the results discussed in the report are based on an extreme scenario in which anthropogenic emissions for the San Francisco
Bay Area and the Sacramento area are set to zero. In this scenario, the report indicates that there would be a decrease
in ozone measurements of 27% in the Northern San Joaquin Valley, ten percent in the Central San Joaquin Valley and seven
percent in Southern San Joaquin Valley. The results discussed in this report are preliminary. EPA will review the
final report when it is available. 
EPA is soliciting comment on whether transport has any impact on EPA's proposed redesignation of the San Francisco
Bay Area to attainment. 


V. Conclusion 


EPA is soliciting public comments on this document and on issues relevant to EPA's proposed action. Comments will
be considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure
