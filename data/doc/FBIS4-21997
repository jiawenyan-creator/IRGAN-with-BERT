  [Text] The 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions, the military 
wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has claimed 
responsibility for the suicide operation carried out by a 
Palestinian youth in Hadera, north of Tel Aviv, in which five 
Israelis were killed and approximately 30 others were wounded. 
  A short while ago, we received a statement from the 
Organization of the Hizaballah Mujahidin-the Occupied Territory 
[munazzamat mujahidi hizballah, al-aradi al-muhtallah] claiming 
responsibility for this operation. The statement says: The 
Hizballah mujahidin were able this morning to explode a bus 
north of Tel Aviv killing and wounding many Israelis.
