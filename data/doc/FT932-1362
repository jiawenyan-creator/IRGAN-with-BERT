FT  24 JUN 93 / Early Caxton book is shunned
CHRISTIE'S held its best auction of printed books and manuscripts in London
for many years yesterday and suffered a grave disappointment when the two
star lots failed to find buyers.
Christie's expected bids above Pounds 400,000 for 'The Recuyell of the
Histories of Troy', the first book printed in English. It was produced by
William Caxton in Bruges in 1473, three years before he set up in
Westminster Abbey. There was no interest, however, probably because leading
British and US libraries have copies and continental European museums do not
take Caxton very seriously.
The book came from the collection of the Marquess of Bath, who was selling
18 duplicates from the library at Longleat House. All the rest sold - for a
total of Pounds 707,500.
A bigger disappointment was the failure to find a buyer for a copy of 'The
Chroniques de France', printed in Paris in 1493 by Antoine Verard, with
numerous woodcuts to increase its appeal. It is an excellent example of the
transition from manuscript to printed book. But the best bid was Pounds
460,000, well below the estimate of Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 700,000.
The auction totalled Pounds 1.87m, with a top price of Pounds 342,500 for a
1560 edition of Luther's Bible translated into German.
The demand for Impressionist and modern art was confirmed at Sotheby's
yesterday when 43 works owned by a Californian collector sold for Pounds
1.5m, with just 10 per cent bought in. 'Notre Dame' by the overlooked
'Orphic' artist, Kupka, beat its forecast at Pounds 238,000. The general
sale brought in Pounds 2.9m with 19.5 per cent unsold and a top price of
Pounds 139,000 for 'La Lecture dans le Jardin' by Henri Lebasque.
Sotheby's main Impressionist auction on Tuesday evening was its best in
London since November 1990 with a total of Pounds 20.35m.
