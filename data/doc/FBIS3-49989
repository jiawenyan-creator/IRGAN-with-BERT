<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic </F>
by Snjezan Lalovic in Pale on 20 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mladic] I and my associates have held talks with 
Generals Cot and Briquemont and their associates. We discussed 
various issues of interest to peace and the more normal and 
regular functioning of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
mission in this region. I expect that General Briquemont's 
contribution to all this will be continued, that this positive 
trend will continue, and that a peaceful solution in this region 
will be found. 
  [Lalovic] We asked General Mladic to comment on the latest 
Geneva talks. 
  [Mladic] It is not at all up to me to comment on them. We 
knew that they [the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government side] would 
not sign. I am convinced that they will not sign next time 
either. War suits them, as the forces that started the war, 
they came for war, and while they are here there will be no 
peace. They have decided to continue the war for as long as 
they have the men and the international support. Since they do 
not lack the latter, and -- despite great losses in the former 
-- they will continue the war because those who pushed them into 
war, their sponsors, will not let them stop the war as they have 
not achieved their aims. They never did care about Muslim 
lives, so Alija Izetbegovic will probably [pauses] He is OK. 
He is not being killed; his supporters are getting killed, 
those who have been blinded by him. 
  [Lalovic] This is what General Mladic told us about 
Izetbegovic's visit to NATO headquarters in Brussels. 
  [Mladic] He must have gone there to hand in his report 
[laughs] and to beg for some aid. 
  [Lalovic] The talks with generals Cot and Briquemont also 
concerned the possibility of the withdrawal of UNPROFOR from 
this region. 
  [Mladic] We discussed the replacement of the Canadian units 
in Srebrenica, but nothing else in that field. 
  [Lalovic] The reporters present only had a chance to speak 
to General Cot in passing. He briefly said that he was in a 
hurry to meet [new UNPROFOR commander] General Rose, and that he 
did not have anything of importance to say prior to his 
departure as UNPROFOR commander for the former Yugoslavia.
