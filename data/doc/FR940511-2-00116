SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Placer Domer U.S. has submitted to the Ely BLM District Office a Plan of Operations (POO). The POO describes proposed
mining operations, including required access, for an area in White Pine County approximately 60 miles northwest
of Ely, Nevada. The Buck and Bald Mining District has been active since 1984 with mineral exploration of the area and
open pit/heap leach gold mining. There are currently six separate mining operations and five are operated by Placer
Domer U.S. The other is Western State's White Pine Gold Mine at the northern end of the mining district. Placer Dome
U.S. is proposing to expand their operation at Bald Mountain Mine by opening the Sage flats area and by establishing
a new processing plant and heap/tailings facility. The Sage Flat area would be mined and ore transported to Placer
Dome's current heap leach facility at the Bald Mountain Mine. The new heap/tailing facility operation would process
2.5 million tons per year and would consist of a new crushing facilities and tailing disposal area. The company also
proposes to open a new open pit mine and heap leach facility in the Mooney Basin. This operation would consist of seven
pits and would mine ore at a rate of 1.5 million tons per year. These modifications to the mine plan and new mine operations
would allow Placer Dome U.S. to operate for seven more years.



The issues expected to be analyzed in the EIS are impacts to: Surface and groundwater, threatened and endangered species,
cultural resources, wildlife, wild horses and mine reclamation. Cumulative impacts for the mining district will
be analyzed in detail and will cover the complete mining district.
