FT  15 DEC 92 / Deal blocked on duty-free goods
Germany last night blocked an agreement to double the amount of duty-free
goods purchased inside the European Community to Ecu90 (Pounds 72),
excluding alcohol and cigarettes, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels. A deal
would have raised EC citizens' travellers allowances on goods purchased
outside the Community to Ecu175 from January 1, 1993.
Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, who chaired the meeting,
expressed disappointment at the failure to reach a deal. He described the
limits on allowances, which go back to the 1950s, as 'wholly unacceptable'
in the light of the imminent official completion of the European single
market.
Germany's opposition stemmed from its failure to push through a claim to set
a road tax for EC vehicles using German highways. This dispute is to be
reviewed by EC transport ministers next Monday.
