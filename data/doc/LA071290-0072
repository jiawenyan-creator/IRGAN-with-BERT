WESTSIDE DIGEST: FAIRFAX; 
HEARING ON PARK LABREA FEE 
A hearing has been set for Sept. 28 on an appeal by Park Labrea management of 
the city's rejection of a proposed charge of more than $3 million to tenants 
for the cost of fencing and gating the 10,000-resident apartment complex. 
"The appellant has claimed that there was departmental error, abuse of 
discretion, and that there is new evidence or information to present which was 
not previously available," said a notice sent by the Rent Stabilization 
Division of the city's Community Development Department. 
The hearing will be held at 9 a.m. at the Rent Adjustment Commission's 
eighth-floor hearing room, at 215 W. 6th St. 
The Rent Stabilization Division, in its decision handed down in May, found that 
Forest City Management Co. did not provide enough information to justify the 
proposed rent increases, and that the fencing and gating system was not yet 
operating when the application was filed. 
Forest City, which operates Park Labrea and owns a half-interest in the 
4,200-unit complex, submitted its application for a rent hike on Sept. 25 of 
last year, hoping to be allowed to charge tenants $12.09 a month in perpetuity 
to defray the cost of the $3,054,588 security system.
