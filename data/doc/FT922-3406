FT  11 JUN 92 / Bar criticised over complaints
THE BAR'S procedures for handling complaints against barristers were
criticised yesterday by the Legal Services Ombudsman for lack of
transparency.
Mr Michael Barnes said in his first annual report that the Bar's procedures
were primarily disciplinary and often left complainants feeling they had
become minor players in the profession's internal disciplinary proceedings.
The Bar's professional conduct committee, which dealt with most complaints
against barristers, offered no possibility of compensation.
