VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD; 
STORES MAY DEMAND PRINTS ON CHECKS 
A quickly scrawled signature and flash of a driver's license may no longer be 
enough to cash a check in Oxnard. Beginning in August, some Oxnard 
check-cashing outlets and retail stores will begin demanding thumbprints on the 
front of checks. 
The fraud/forgery unit of the Oxnard Police Department hopes that the city's 
most vulnerable merchants will sign up with Operation Chek-Print, a new program 
to prevent forged, stolen and counterfeit checks. 
Using new stain-free ink pads, police are targeting check-cashing companies, 
small liquor stores and family-owned markets -- those most susceptible to 
fraudulent checks, said Detective Peter Nicolle of the fraud/forgery unit. 
"It's generally at the retail level that we're aiming this," Nicolle said. 
"Crooks will get out of the business of being forgers in Oxnard." 
Oxnard is the latest city to begin using a new technology to capture 
thumbprints without offending customers with stained thumbs and discolored 
clothing. The chemical dye used in the special ink pads reacts only with paper, 
leaving no trace on human skin. 
"You're not making a mess," said Steve Gordon, vice president of Signature 
Security of Omaha, which began making the dye about two years ago. 
Oxnard police said they will be able to match suspect thumbprints with those 
gathered by CAL-ID, a statewide computer program that holds the prints of most 
adults arrested since 1970. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ
