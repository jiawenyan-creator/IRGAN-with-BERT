TANKER PLANE EXPLODES ON RUNWAY AT AIR BASE 
A National Guard KC-135 tanker plane caught fire and exploded on a runway 
Thursday, but there were no serious injuries, officials said. 
The plane exploded at Pease Air Force Base, which President Bush uses when he 
travels between Washington and his Kennebunkport, Me., vacation home, Air Force 
officials said. 
No one was on board the plane when it exploded, said Capt. Laura Spence, a base 
spokeswoman. The incident is being investigated.
