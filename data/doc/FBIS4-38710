  [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- The Kuwaiti Embassy in Moscow 
has learnt that some Russian pro-Iraqi groups have circulated a 
statement to demand cancellation of economic sanctions against 
Iraq. They have also held a rally under this slogan in front of 
the Russian Foreign Ministry's building, says a statement for 
the press circulated by the embassy today. 
  The document was circulated before a news conference of head 
of the Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation and the Kuwaiti 
parliament Ahmad al-Sa'dun at the Russian State Duma. 
  The embassy is closely watching the activities of these 
groups. It reminds that economic sanctions against Baghdad were 
used in response to devastating consequences of the Iraqi attack 
at Kuwait. 
  If these groups really want to stop sufferings of the Iraqi 
people from sanctions, they should appeal to the Saddam Husayn 
regime and persuade it of the only way to achieve this goal - 
unconditional fulfillment of all resolutions of the United 
Nations Security Council on the Kuwaiti-Iraqi problem, says the 
document. 
  Iraq should recognize the Kuwaiti sovereignty and respect 
its 
territorial integrity, it should free and return home all POWs 
and civilians and unconditionally recognize the U.N. Security 
Council resolutions on demarcation of the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border, 
notes the statement.
