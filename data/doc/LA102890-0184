AUBURN CAN'T KICK AFTER 17-16 VICTORY; 
SEC: TIGERS BEAT MISSISSIPPI STATE WHEN CRAWFORD BLOCKS CONVERSION ATTEMPT. 
Auburn Coach Pat Dye wasn't a bit surprised. 
Darrel Crawford blocked Joel Logan's conversion kick with 2 1/2 minutes to 
play, preserving Auburn's 17-16 Southeastern Conference victory over 
Mississippi State Saturday. 
"Mississippi State certainly didn't surprise me. I guess I am the only one who 
thinks they have a good team," Dye said. "The game turned out exactly like I 
expected, but I hoped it wouldn't be that close at the end." 
Mississippi State, 3-4 overall and 0-4 in the SEC, had a chance to tie the 
Tigers (6-0-1, 3-0-1) after David Fair's two-yard run with 2:33 to play. But 
Crawford, a junior linebacker, batted down Logan's kick to preserve Auburn's 
unbeaten record. 
Fair's touchdown, on his only carry of the game, capped an 80-yard, nine-play 
drive keyed by a pass interference penalty on a third-and-10 play that gave the 
Bulldogs a first down at the Tiger 45. Fair scored six plays later. 
Auburn got what proved to be the margin of victory with 13:25 remaining in the 
game when Jim Von Wyl kicked a 20-yard field goal after a drive was halted at 
the Mississippi State three. 
Auburn outgained Mississippi State, 405-292, in handing the Bulldogs their 10th 
consecutive SEC defeat and ninth in a row against Dye. 
"I don't see how you could expect any more from our players," State Coach 
Rockey Felker said. "We came through and got the (final) touchdown when we 
needed it, but I'm not sure what happened on the extra point." 
Freshman quarterback Stan White directed two second-quarter scoring drives as 
Auburn overcame a 3-0 Mississippi State lead. 
"We moved the ball pretty well in the first half, we just couldn't quite get 
over that hump," White said. "We've been in this situation all year. It always 
seems to come down to one big play.
