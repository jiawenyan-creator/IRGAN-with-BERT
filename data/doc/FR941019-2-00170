 

On December 17, 1993, the panel issued a second decision, again remanding the determination to Commerce, but this
time with instructions to determine that countervailable subsidies were not being provided to Canadian producers
of softwood lumber. On January 6, 1994, Commerce issued a second remand decision, complying with the panel's instructions.

On February 23, 1994, the panel affirmed Commerce's second remand determination. The binational panel's decision
became final on March 17, 1994. 59 Fed. Reg. 12584 (March 17, 1994).

On April 6, 1994, USTR filed a request for the establishment of an Extraordinary Challenge Committee (ECC) pursuant
to FTA Article 1904.13. The request challenged the panel's substantive determination as well as the conduct of two
of the five panelists.

On August 3, 1994, the ECC, by a two-to-one decision, affirmed the panel's decision. On August 16, 1994, Commerce published
notice of revocation of the CVD order on softwood lumber from Canada and termination of the suspension of liquidation
on softwood lumber entered on or after March 17, 1994. 59 Fed. Reg. 42029 (Aug. 16, 1994).

USTR's previous notice of September 1992 indicated that covered entries would be assessed Section 301 duties at the
lower of the MOU rate or the Commerce subsidy rate at the conclusion of Chapter 19 proceedings. Chapter 19 proceedings
have now concluded with a determination of no countervailable subsidies. Accordingly, no Section 301 duties will
be assessed on the covered entries.

The Customs Service is therefore directed to: cease the extension of liquidation that was ordered pursuant to Section
301 on softwood lumber from Canada that entered from October 4, 1991 to March 12, 1992; de-obligate bonds collected
on those entries pursuant to Section 301; and assess no Section 301 duties on those entries. This action pertains only
to the Section 301 action and is unrelated to the disposition of cash deposits collected pursuant to the lumber CVD
order itself.

Under Section 307, the USTR may modify or terminate action, subject to the direction, if any, of the President, if,
inter alia, 

the action was taken under section 301(b) and the USTR finds the action no longer to be appropriate. USTR has consulted
with representatives of the affected domestic industry regarding this action.



Public Comment: Requirements for Submissions



Section 307(a)(2) requires USTR to provide an opportunity for comment by interested parties affected by a termination
of action concerning the effects of the termination and whether the termination is appropriate. Accordingly, all
interested persons affected by this termination may submit written comments concerning it. USTR will consider any
comments submitted.

D.C. 20506. All comments should be submitted by November 18, 1994.

Comments will be placed in a file (Docket 30187) open to public inspection pursuant to 15 CFR 2006.13, except
