WORLD; 
CARDINAL GLEMP HAS SURGERY 
Cardinal Jozef Glemp, leader of Poland's powerful Roman Catholic Church, was in 
serious condition today after emergency surgery to stop bleeding in his 
digestive system, state-run media said. 
Glemp, 61, was in intensive care at a large provincial hospital in the Praga 
section of Warsaw, church officials said. 
A spokesman at the cardinal's residence said Glemp's "state of health is 
improving." 
The official PAP news agency said President Wojciech Jaruzelski visited Glemp 
in the hospital after the surgery Tuesday night. 
Glemp has been primate since 1981 and a cardinal since 1983. Under his 
leadership, the church gave support to the banned Solidarity movement and 
participated in the negotiations that led to the union's legalization in April 
and eventually to the dismantling of the Communist hold on power.
