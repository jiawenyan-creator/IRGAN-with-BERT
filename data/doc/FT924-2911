FT  10 DEC 92 / Observer: Outgoing
Incoming Philips finance director Dudley Eustace told the Reuters newswire
yesterday that he wants to improve the company's communications with the
outside world.
After its clumsy handling of its profits-warning in June, Philips needs to
improve relations with the investment community. But Eustace did not exactly
prove a dab hand in that respect while at British Aerospace's financial
controls. The market was certainly ill-prepared for the appalling background
to BAe's rights issue flop last year.
