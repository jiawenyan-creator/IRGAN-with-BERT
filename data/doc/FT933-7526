FT  20 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agricuture: Ukrainian grain estimate raised
UKRAINIAN Agriculture Minister, Mr Yuri Karasyk, expects a 1993 grain
harvest of more than 50m tonnes, the Ukrinform news agency said yesterday,
reports Reuter from Kiev.
An earlier official forecast had put the harvest at up to 44m tonnes,
compared with last year's 39m-40m tonnes.
Ukrinform said Mr Karasyk's forecast was made on Wednesday to a meeting of
farm chiefs in Kiev.
The minister estimated general grain yields at 3.5 tonnes a hectare, with
wheat yields rising to more than four tonnes a hectare. Given such a
harvest, he said, state orders would total between 15m and 17m tonnes, well
above requirements. 'We have every possibility not only of eliminating
purchases of foreign grain, but even of selling it,' he said. 'This applies
particularly to wheat. There is even a possibility of exporting seed.'
Ukraine last year imported small amounts of grain, mainly for animal feed.
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted Ukraine's ambassador in Moscow, Mr Vladimir
Kryzhanovsky, as saying the country had such a good grain harvest this year
that it was considering the possibility of paying off its debt for Russian
energy supplies with 5m tonnes of grain exports.
Kiev owes Moscow about Dollars 1bn for energy supplies.
As of August 9, the Russian harvest of grains and pulses (excluding maize)
was behind last year, slowed by a lack of fuel and machinery, according to a
US agricultural attache, reports Reuter from Washington.
However, yields have shown a significant improvement over last season, the
attache wrote in a field report filed from Moscow. Grain crops had been cut
and threshed on about half as much area compared with that time last year.
Sales to state resources were slower than last year, hindered by
disagreements between farmers and the government over prices, the report
said.
