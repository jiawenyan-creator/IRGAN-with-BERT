SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
Omar, the first Asian elephant born at the San Diego Wild Animal Park, made his 
first public appearance Friday afternoon. 
"For about a half an hour he was allowed into a small yard behind his 
quarters," park spokesman Tom Hanscom said. 
"He tested his feet on the dirt. He's been on concrete since he was born." 
Omar wobbled for a crowd of about 40. Hanscom said he is scheduled to make 
public appearances Saturday and Sunday, from noon to 3 p.m. Omar will also be 
visible from the monorail that runs through the park. 
Park officials said they separated the 265-pound calf from his mother when he 
was born early Tuesday morning because she rejected him and tried to kill him. 
Hanscom said the park will raise the calf, which is now being bottle-fed on a 
human infant formula. Although the milk of his mother, Connie, is important to 
develop the calf's immune system, Hanscom said park officials are optimistic 
and are giving Omar better than a 50% chance of surviving.
