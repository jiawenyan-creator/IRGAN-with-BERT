  [Text] The month of May may be a time for spring delights 
but not when it rains. When it rains, a recent scientific 
research showed, acidity is sometimes as high as 100 times the 
permissible limit. 
  The two-year research, conducted jointly by the Environment 
Ministry and the Korea Meteorological Administration, in fact 
showed that 70 percent of the rain which fell between May 1992 
and August last year was acid. 
  "That makes the situation even worse is that 70 percent of 
the acid rain is believed to have resulted from impurities 
transported from China," one environment official said. 
  He observed that the rain which fell across the nation at 
the 
end of last week showed an acidity of 4.9 pH, making it one of 
the most acid concentrated precipitation this year. 
  According to the research, there were four instances during 
the surveyed period in which of rain had acidity levels of under 
3.6 pH much lower that the safe level of 5.6, and 32 occasions 
when the measurements were between 3.6 and 4.6 pH. One twice 
did it record over 5.6. [sentence as received] 
  The environment official noted that the ministry spent over 
10 trillion won over the past 14 years on reducing air and water 
pollution and the latest results show that they have largely 
been ineffective. 
  During the cited period, the concentration of sulfur dioxide 
fell from an average of 0.094 ppm (parts per million) to 0.023 
whereas those for acid rain has only been getting from bad to 
worse. 
  "It appears that the main problem pertaining to acid rain is 
the transportation of impurities, including chemicals, from 
China, resulting from brisk industrialization there, which were 
carried here by westerly winds, the environment official said. 
  He noted that acid rain is especially acute in metropolitan 
and other heavily populated areas.
