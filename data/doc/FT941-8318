FT  21 FEB 94 / Amman pact ends Yemen's political crisis
An agreement ending Yemen's seven-month political crisis was signed in
Jordan yesterday with the aim of averting civil war and the collapse of
Yemen's fragile unification between north and south.
The agreement was signed by Yemen's two main leaders, President Ali Abdullah
Saleh and Vice President Ali Salem al-Biedh, but Jordan's King Hussein had
to literally force the two rivals to shake hands.
The crisis began in August 1993 when Mr Biedh left the capital, Sana'a, in
the north for his political base, Aden, in the former South Yemen.
Frustrated by what he saw as a centralisation of power in the north, a lack
of security in the country and mismanagement of the economy, he threatened
to reverse the 1990 union between the two former Yemens unless the
government adopted a programme of national reform.
The document signed in Amman goes some way to meeting Mr Biedh's demands but
diplomats in Sana'a were not confident it would hold.
King Hussein's mediation in the dispute is being portrayed in Amman as a
boost to Jordan's standing in the Arab world after the marginalisation which
followed the Gulf war in 1990. The ceremony was witnessed by dignitaries
including Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, in
the largest political gathering in Amman since the 1987 Arab League summit.
