 

C. 34 CFR 682.607Payment of a Refund to a Lender 


The Secretary modifies the deadlines by which an affected institution shall pay a refund that is due to a lender, within
60 days after the student's withdrawal as determined under 34 CFR 682.605(b)(1)(3) or within 30 days in the
case of a student who does not return to the institution at the expiration of an approved leave of absence under 34 CFR
682.605(c). Instead, the Secretary will require the institution to pay a refund to the lender within 120 days (instead
of 60) after the student's withdrawal or within 60 days (instead of 30) after the last day of the leave of absence. 


D. 34 CFR 682.610Records, Reports, and Inspection Requirements for Participating Schools 


The Secretary modifies the deadline in 34 CFR 682.610(c) that an institution complete and submit required Student
Status Confirmation Reports (SSCRs) to the Secretary or guaranty agency within 30 days of the institution's receipt
of the report but will instead require completion and submission of these reports within 90 days. Reports of changes
of borrower status if the institution does not expect to submit its next SSCR within the next 60 days may also be submitted
within 90 days (instead of 30 days). 


Waiver of Rulemaking 


In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act, 20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A), and the
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity
to comment on proposed regulations. However, the severe impact of the earthquake in California has caused a national
emergency that has been recognized by the Congress. The Secretary, recognizing the severe devastation of the California
earthquake victims, finds that soliciting further public comment with respect to this notice of relief from regulatory
requirements is impracticable and contrary to the public interest under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). 


Executive Order 12866 


This notice has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary
has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
The potential costs associated with this notice are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined
necessary for providing emergency relief during a natural disaster. This notice provides relief from administrative
burden associated with information collection requirements. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 


The Secretary certifies that this notice will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. The small entities affected by this notice are small institutions of postsecondary education. This notice
provides temporary regulatory relief and will not increase institutions' workload or costs associated with administering
the Title IV, HEA programs. It will therefore not have a significant economic impact on the entities affected. 


Assessment of Educational Impact 


The Secretary has determined that this document does not require transmission of information that is being gathered
by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States.
